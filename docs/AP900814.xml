<TEXT>
   The call by Saddam Hussein for Arab forces
to rise up to protect Islam is being seriously heeded in Egypt. But
thousands of eager young Egyptians are signing up to fight the
Iraqi president, not his enemies.
   On Monday, as they have for days, crowds of university
graduates, civil servants and unemployed youth milled outside the
embassies of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait in
hopes of enlisting in those oil-rich countries' armies. Kuwait has
been occupied since Aug. 2 by Iraqi forces.
   Some said dreams of big money as mercenaries were alluring.
However, most emphasized their goals were to save Islam's holiest
shrines in Mecca and Medina from desecration either by Iraqis or by
Westerners fighting to repel what some believe is an imminent Iraqi
invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   A Saudi official said 4,000 men had registered since Saturday
for duty.
   ``If Mecca falls, we're finished,'' said Ashraf Ahmed, a
25-year-old schoolteacher. ``I want to go fight because the Iraqis
are bad people, because we want to free our brothers there (in
Kuwait) and because we want to defend the Islamic holy places.''
   Ahmed was among at least 200 men overflowing into the street
beside the Saudi Embassy, filling out papers and stuffing them
through a small window to an embassy employee.
   The scene was being repeated blocks away at the embassy of the
United Arab Emirates. The UAE and Saudi Arabia are among Persian
Gulf countries who asked other Arabs for help to defend themselves
against a possible Iraqi incursion.
   Egypt, Morocco and Syria are among those countries committing
troops in line with a resolution adopted by 12 states at an Arab
summit Friday. The resolution also supported Saudi Arabia's request
for U.S. military help, which has led to deployment of a
multinational force near its 500-mile border with Iraq.
   As the summit was going on, Saddam issued a statement urging
Arabs to attack Western forces in the gulf region. He also said the
Saudi ruling family should be overthrown to protect and ``rescue''
the shrines of Islam in the kingdom.
   The enlistment queues at the Saudi, UAE and Kuwait embassies
appeared to have formed spontaneously.
   The Saudi Embassy official who spoke of 4,000 registrants said
the embassy had not advertised for volunteers. ``They just came on
their own,'' he said.
   A letter is all that is needed, including a volunteer's name,
age, profession, military experience and willingness to join the
armed forces.
   The Saudi official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
has no idea what will become of the offers.
   ``We will later transfer all these forms to the Egyptian
government,'' he said. ``Some of the volunteers ask me about
payment, but I tell them we haven't heard of that at all.''
   The volunteers were discussing figures of 2,600 Saudi riyals per
month _ about $695 monthly at current conversion rates _ to 10,000
riyals, or $2,674, for the whole mission.
   Egypt's latest per capita income is about $670 annually.
   One of the volunteers said he would be surprised if they were
not rewarded for their service. Said Salem Sayed, outside the
Kuwaiti embassy, ``There will probably be some kind of appreciation
for standing by them.''
   About 3,000 Egyptian soldiers have arrived in Saudi Arabia, a
significant contribution by an Arab country but small compared to
the estimated 50,000 U.S. forces scheduled to be sent there.
Another 1,000 Egyptian troops are expected soon in Saudi Arabia.

   Arabs who support President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq often cite one simple fact: He is a fellow Arab
while most of the troops arrayed against him in the Persian Gulf
region are foreigners.
   Almost half the 21 members of the Arab League find his
annexation of Kuwait more palatable than the armed forces from the
United States, Britain and France deployed to defend Saudi Arabia.
   These countries in Arab eyes are identified with the creation
and support of Israel, colonial exploitation and even the Crusades
of the Middle Ages.
   Saddam's invasion of a fellow Arab state was a shock. But many
Arabs consider the West's intervention to thwart an Arab leader who
has challenged Israel is a greater reason for alarm.
   Veteran Middle East analyst Charles Snow noted: ``The West, and
indeed the international community as a whole, may see the invasion
... in black-and-white terms as a simple case of aggression by a
large and powerful country against a virtually defenseless
neighbor.''
   But he wrote in Monday's edition of the Middle East Economic
Survey that ``in the Arab world, there is a profound ambivalence
about President Saddam and there are many who are prepared to
overlook the attack on Kuwait for the sake of Iraq's willingness to
stand up to outsiders both on its own behalf and if defense of Arab
causes'' like the struggle to regain Palestine.
   Violent anti-American demonstrations have erupted in Jordan,
Yemen, Sudan, Mauritania and the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Nine Arab League members rejected Friday's initiative to send
troops to Saudi Arabia and support U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   One of the opponents, Libya, has been opposed to the United
States since Col. Moammar Gadhafi seizing power in 1969.
   Another, the Palestine Liberation Organization, has been
frustrated in the failure to translate its dialogue with the United
States into concrete moves toward a state.
   Yemen is a longtime Saudi rival and gets massive aid from Saddam.
   But many moderate states, some with good relations with the
United States, see its intervention as a bald attempt to protect
American wallets, not a stand on principle.
   ``The use of international law to justify the American presence
on Islamic soil is only a means of defending Western interests,''
Rabah Bitat, president of the Algerian People's National Assembly,
said Monday.
   ``The different people of the region should find their solutions
under an Arab and regional umbrella, without any outside
interference.''
   But the Arabs cannot agree on a solution.
   Friday's Arab League resolution to send troops and respect
U.N.-mandated sanctions had the support of the kings and emirs of
the gulf, along with King Hassan II of Morocco. They see Iraq's
Aug. 2 overthrow of Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed Al-Sabah of Kuwait as a
bad precedent for all monarchs.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria has a personal dispute with the
Iraqi leader aggravated by a 20-year rift between the rival
branches of the Arab Baath Socialist Party that rules in both
countries.
   President Hosni Mubarak believed Saddam insulted him by breaking
a promise not to invade Kuwait.
   There is a widespread feeling among Arabs that the United States
has a double standard when held against Washington's reluctance to
push Israel out of the territories it has occupied since the 1967
Middle East war.
   The United States, said Jordanian political analyst Kamel Abdel
Jaber, ``maintained a dark and horrible silence when Israel
continues, 23 years later, to occupy the West Bank, Jerusalem and
the (former Syrian) Golan Heights.''
   Wrote the independent Tunisian daily As-Sabah: ``The United
States has only caused misfortune to Arabs.''
   It is a sentiment Saddam appeals to repeatedly in his speeches.
   He tried to justify his annexation of Kuwait as correcting an
injury of colonial map makers.
   On Sunday, he linked his possible withdrawal from Kuwait to
Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the occupied territories,
including Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest city.
   Saddam also accused the Saudi kings of defiling the holy city of
Mecca and Medina, calling for their overthrow for allowing American
troops into the kingdom.
   The basis for Arab unity reaches back to Harun al-Rashid, the
Islamic caliph who ruled a truly united Arab world from Baghdad to
the Atlantic in the 9th century, the last time it was one piece.
   The first violations of that unity were the Crusades, which to
the Arab public might have happened yesterday.
   Notes Lebanese historian Amin Maalouf: ``The Arab East still
sees the West as a natural enemy ... and there can be now doubt
that the schism between these two worlds dates from the Crusades,
deeply felt by the Arabs, even today, as an act of rape.''

   Experts say moral and political considerations would keep the
United States from retaliating in kind to a chemical weapons strike
by Iraq. But there is another constraint: The weapons would
accomplish little.
   Much of the U.S. arsenal of poison gas weapons is old and
defective. What could be used is designed for a close-quarters
fight in European fields and forests, not the hot, open expanses of
the desert. Moreover, nearly half the 30,000 tons of U.S. chemical
agents sits in storage tanks in Arkansas, Indiana and other states.
   ``What chemicals the United States could get there would be in
artillery shells and that doesn't figure into the kind of response
we'd want to make,'' said Gordon Burck, a Washington consultant and
former director of studies on chemical and biological warfare at
the Federation of American Scientists.
   The United States and other powers pledged in an international
pact during the 1970s not to be the first to use chemical weapons.
The use of chemical weapons in war were banned under the Geneva
Conventions after World War I.
   Experts like Burck agree there is little chance U.S. forces
would ever use chemical weapons in response to an Iraqi attack. The
nation and its allies could not abide their use; the United States'
would lose whatever moral high ground it now has in the Arab world
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``It would put the president on the same moral plane as (Iraq
President Saddam) Hussein in the eyes of people who haven't made up
their mind on the issue,'' said Matthew Meselson, a Harvard
biochemist who has advised arms control negotiators since 1963.
   Although this country has not used lethal chemical agents since
World War I, large quantities of tear gas, known as CS, were used
during the Vietnam War.
   ``They shipped 11 million pounds of it in 155mm shells and
500-pound bombs,'' said Meselson. ``The purpose was to force men
out of protective cover so they could come into the line of fire.
It was called a `force multiplier,' but it didn't multiply the
force much. It wasn't very successful.''
   The United States' arsenal of lethal chemicals includes mustard
gas, which can burn the skin and lungs; the lethal nerve gas known
as GA or Sarin, and VX, a more deadly nerve agent that can kill
after limited contact to the skin.
   The weapons and chemicals are kept in Alabama, Arkansas,
Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Oregon and Tooele, Utah,
where 40 percent of the U.S. arsenal is stored.
   Chemical artillery shells kept in Europe are slated to be moved
to Johnston Atoll in the Pacific later this year to be destroyed.
   Brad Roberts, a chemical arms expert at Washington's Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said these weapons were
stockpiled over the years as a deterrent in any European land war
with the Soviet Union.
   But in the mid-1980s, a presidential commission reported that
only 11 percent to 28 percent of the U.S. stockpile had any
military application. Half the stockpile is simply chemicals stored
in bulk.
   Most of the chemical bombs, rockets and land mines, produced
from World War II until 1969, are outdated and unreliable. Roberts
said much of the chemical artillery shells are for 105mm cannon,
which is now in limited use.
   The artillery weapons that remain available would have little
military value in any conflict envisioned in the Middle East.
   ``The war we seem to be looking at is not of artillery duels or
ground attacks as we envisioned in Europe, but of air
superiority,'' said Roberts. ``The only kinds of these weapons that
could be used would be air delivered bombs and we don't have any.''
   The military and political limitations of chemical warfare
raised in the Iraq crisis and the new strategic situation in Europe
are likely to renew debate over eliminating U.S. chemical weapons
entirely.
   ``If they couldn't use them in this scenario, where could they
use it?'' asked Burck. ``We made a gross mistake in past years and
made things we probably didn't need. We may re-evaluate keeping any
stockpiles at all.

   Rock singer Don Henley and other luminaries from
music and politics launched an effort Monday to preserve Walden
Pond by buying some adjoining land slated for development.
   The Walden Woods Project is buying a 25-acre stretch of the
woodland made famous by literary recluse Henry David Thoreau to
forestall plans for a 139-unit condominium.
   The project, along with a group called the Trust for Public
Land, also is negotiating to acquire another section of woods, 700
yards from the pond, which is scheduled to be an office park.
   Henley, formerly of the Eagles rock group, founded the Walden
Woods Project and shares the chairmanship with U.S. Sen. Paul
Tsongas and Michael Kennedy, son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy
and president of the Citizens Energy Corp.
   The group announced agreements with the state and private
developers to conserve land around the pond where Thoreau built an
cabin and lived for two years, and also promoted an effort to
create affordable housing in nearby Concord.
   Henley was joined by singers Bonnie Raitt, Arlo Guthrie, Aimee
Mann and members of the band Boston.
   The group is using a $100,000 grant from Hearst magazines for a
down payment on the proposed condominium site.
   Hearst officials said all advertising revenues from the first
issue of their new publication, Countryside, will be donated to
eight land trust programs around the country.
   ``About 500,000 people visit Walden Pond every year and for many
of them, it's the closest they come to a natural wilderness
experience,'' said Peter Forbes, New England regional director for
the Trust for Public Land.
   Walden Pond is a 62-acre body of water in a 333-acre state
reservation on the edge of Concord, an affluent town of 12,500
about 20 miles from Boston.
   The pond is far less pastoral than described in ``Walden,''
Thoreau's 1854 meditation on solitude and the wilderness. It lies
less than a hundred yards from a highway and is next to a garbage
dump.
   Henley organized the efforts after seeing a TV report earlier
this year about the proposed developments near Walden Pond.

   Four Cubans seeking political refuge have
forced their way into the Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana,
the Mexican government news agency Notimex reported.
   The action Monday complicates Cuban efforts to end a series of
embassy invasions last month that strained Cuban relations with
European nations. Eighteen Cubans remain at the Spanish Embassy.
   Notimex said the Belgian Embassy's second secretary, Illy
Leeman, said the four Cubans aged 20 to 40 entered the residence of
Ambassador Loie Cornet.
   He said that police surrounded the building after the Belgians
notified Cuban officials.
   Belgian officials said they would not release the names of the
refuge-seekers for security reasons.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has insisted that refuge-seekers
should surrender unconditionally to Cuban authorities, although it
has given promises not to prosecute many of them.
   Spain has insisted that all those in its embassy should be given
asylum.
   Asylum-seekers also had entered homes of Czechoslovak and
Italian diplomats earlier this summer, but eventually departed.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has asked Japan to increase its aid
to Middle Eastern nations affected by the Persian Gulf crisis,
Foreign Ministry officials said today.
   The Foreign Ministry did not specify which nations were
considered for increased aid. Egypt, Jordan and Turkey are among
Japanese aid recipients affected by the increaed tensions following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Bush telephoned Kaifu Monday night U.S. time, which was this
morning in Japan, and asked Japan to boost its support of countries
involved in the crisis, said a Foreign Ministry official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Kaifu was quoted as replying that Japan was studying how it
could cooperate with the international effort to restore peace and
stability in the region, and he would consider expanding support
for nations affected by the crisis.
   Japan is debating how to increase its backing for the
international effort to make Iraq withdraw its invaders from
Kuwait, and Kaifu on Monday postponed a trip to five Middle Eastern
countries in order to concentrate on the Gulf crisis.
   Japan's constitution forbids the use of force to resolve
international disputes and the country could not send military
units to join the U.S.-led multinational force that is quarantining
trade with Iraq.
   In 1987, confronted with similar demands from its Western
partners to aid the effort against Iraqi and Iranian attacks on oil
tankers in the gulf, Japan eventually gave indirect financial help.
   Tokyo financed a navigation system to keep track of ships in the
gulf, gave Jordan loans and grants worth about $550 million and a
credit line of $300 million, and increased the money it paid to
support U.S. troops based in Japan.
   But the Japanese government decided against sending a
minesweeper to the gulf as other countries did, because of the
constitutional ban on sending troops into action overseas.
   A high Foreign Ministry official told reporters Monday that
Japan is determined to decide on ``concrete measures'' to help in
the gulf crisis. Makoto Watanabe, director of the ministry's Middle
Eastern affairs bureau, said the government ``will examine all
possible measures while observing the provisions of the
constitution.''
   Japan has agreed to a full trade embargo on Iraq and Kuwait,
which were supplying 11.2 percent of Japan's oil in the first half
of 1990.
   Turkey borders Iraq and has shut down Iraq's parallel pipelines.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak convened an Arab League meeting
last week that condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and called for
an Arab force to be sent to Saudi Arabia. The first Arab troops to
arrive there were Egyptians.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once again, in the Persian Gulf as in Korea
and the Cuban missile crisis, an administration is seeking soft
words for harsh actions.
   President Bush vows a total bar to Iraqi shipping, but avoids
calling it a blockade.
   U.S. warplanes are conducting fighter missions over the gulf,
but the president says the United States is not at war.
   More than 3,000 Americans are trapped in Kuwait and Iraq, but
nobody will call them hostages.
   The semantic distinctions have legal as well as political
reasons behind them, experts say, but they also suggest it is wise
to pay attention to what the administration does, not just what it
says.
   ``It does seem to be functionally a limited naval blockade,''
said W. Thomas Mallison, professor emeritus of law at George
Washington University and a specialist in the law of armed conflict.
   ``If you are stopping ships, it sounds suspiciously like a
blockade, doesn't it?'' said S.I. Hayakawa, the former California
senator who is the author of widely used books on semantics.
   The administration avoids calling it a blockade because the term
can be interpreted as meaning an act of war.
   ``Let's not use the word blockade,'' Secretary of State James A.
Baker III said in a television interview Sunday. ``Let's just say
we have the legal basis for interdicting these things.''
   Bush, at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, said, ``No point
getting into all these semantics. The main thing is to stop the oil
from coming out of there and that is what we're going to do.''
   Asked whether food shipments to Iraq would also be blocked, the
president replied, ``Just watch. Everything.''
   A spokesman for Australia's foreign ministry, announcing Monday
that his government will join the action, used the term
``blockade'' and said the aim was to prevent any supplies from
going into or out of Iraq.
   Mallison, as a retired Naval officer, worked with Navy lawyers
on the 1962 quarantine of Soviet vessels carrying offensive
missiles to Cuba. The Soviets at first challenged the blockade, but
later diverted their ships.
   Mallison said the word ``blockade'' was avoided because it
``conjured up pictures of the ... U.S. and British blockades of
World War II, which said in effect to the Axis enemy that you can't
use the oceans.''
   ``Perhaps the interdiction terminology is used here as it was in
the Cuban situation to indicate that there are limitations on it,''
he said.
   In his televised address before flying to Kennebunkport last
week, Bush assured the nation that ``we're not in a war'' in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``At the moment, I guess we're not,'' said Mallison.
   Hayakawa agreed, saying that at this time, ``It is something
very much short of a war.''
   The United States has committed 50,000 troops to the region and
warplanes from the carrier USS Independence have been conducting
fighter missions over the gulf for several hours a night since a
few days after Iraq's armed takeover of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In 1950, President Truman used the phrase ``police action'' to
describe the dispatch of United Nations troops, most of them
American, to Korea. Before the war ended three years later, about
580,000 U.N. and South Korean troops and 1.6 million North Korean
and Chinese fighting men were killed or wounded.
   ``You could again call it (Korea) a limited war, functionally,''
Mallison said.
   He said the laws of armed conflict, such as those governing
treatment of prisoners of war, go into effect under the Geneva
Convention ``whatever label you put on it.''
   The State Department said Monday that about 500 Americans have
quietly slipped out of Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion,
circumventing Iraqi efforts to detain them. This leaves about 2,500
in Kuwait and 500 to 600 in Iraq.
   The administration has refused to call them hostages.
   ``Hostages frequently are associated with some kind of a demand,
and the Iraq government, in spite of having made various demands,
hasn't linked any of them to U.S. or other Western personnel,''
said Mallison.
   ``Of course in view of what happened to Jimmy Carter and the
great anguish over the embassy captives in Iran there is fear also
of political fallout domestically if you call them hostages,'' he
said.
   Former President Carter was defeated for re-election in 1980
after prolonged efforts, which succeeded on Ronald Reagan's
inauguration day, to free 52 Americans held hostage in Tehran.
   Bush, responding to a question in Kennebunkport, refused to
describe the detention of Americans by the Iraqis as ``a hostage
situation.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler has described the
Americans as ``sequestered.''

<HEAD>Control of Multinational Forces in Saudi is Sensitive Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American soldiers are used to training with
foreign troops, but fighting Iraq with the multinational force
taking shape in Saudi Arabia would pose staggering problems in
command and control, military experts say.
   ``The first problem to solve is communication _ a combination of
language and the technical means of passing messages,'' said Adm.
Thomas H. Moorer, a retired former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and NATO naval commander.
   A more sensitive question is how to assign control of forces,
Moorer and others said Monday.
   For reasons of national pride the Saudis will want at least
nominal control over the U.S. and other foreign forces on their
soil. But Pentagon planners say actual combat operations, if
required, would be mainly under U.S. direction.
   ``It's probably the biggest problem we can see right now,'' said
an Army strategist who discussed planning for Operation Desert
Shield _ the American deployment of warplanes and ground forces to
Saudi Arabia _ on condition he not be identified.
   At least 50,000 U.S. troops have been committed to the Saudi
operation, including Marines, Army air assault forces, paratroopers
and infantry. They are part of a multinational effort to deter
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from invading Saudi Arabia, which is
the United States' largest supplier of imported oil.
   The lead elements of an Egyptian combat force, expected to total
at least 4,000 men, arrived over the weekend at a Saudi air base
near the Iraqi border. Morocco is expected to send roughly an equal
number of ground forces this week; Syria is committing troops; and
Pakistan voted Monday to send forces.
   In the seas surrounding Saudi Arabia, a large U.S. naval armada
is complemented by warships from Britain, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands and other nations.
   For the Americans on Saudi soil, cultural barriers are a special
concern.
   The Islamic kingdom strongly disapproves of unmarried women and
men associating with each other in public, and Islamic law
prohibits the possession or use of alcohol. The kingdom also shares
the Arab world's hostility toward Jews.
   The Pentagon, however, is making ``no special arrangements'' for
the women and Jews who have arrived in Saudi Arabia as part of the
American force, said spokesman Capt. Sam Grizzle.
   American forces have trained with foreign troops for decades.
Most of the training has been with the West European and Canadian
allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Over the past 10
years the Army also has held field exercises with various nations
in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.
   Last winter about 5,000 troops directed by the U.S. Central
Command participated in war games with the Egyptian army in the
desert near the Nile River delta. Some of the Americans were from
units now being deployed to Saudi Arabia.
   Joshua M. Epstein, a defense analyst at the Brookings
Institution think tank in Washington, said coordinating U.S. and
Saudi combat operations in the event of a war against Iraq would be
made easier by the fact that most Saudi weaponry is U.S.-made.
   Maj. Gen. Don L. Kaufman, chief of a permanent U.S. contingent
in Saudi Arabia that trains Saudis to use U.S.-built weaponry, said
Monday the kingdom's leadership ``has been very cooperative'' in
accommodating the U.S. troop arrivals.
   Kaufman's comments suggested that the Pentagon was calling the
shots in the desert campaign, and that the Saudis had not fully
understood American intentions.
   ``They are finding that we are not going to allow a handful of
Americans to be in harm's way,'' he told a group of American
reporters at an air base in Saudi Arabia. ``The numbers are larger,
I think, than the Saudis originally anticipated.''
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, commander of a nine-ship U.S.
naval group in the Persian Gulf, said Monday that no decision had
been made on who would be in charge in the event of war.
   ``It is being worked on,'' he said. He declined to say whether
U.S. forces would be subordinate to non-American commanders.
   The most obvious and seemingly simple problem for a
multinational force _ the language barrier _ can be eased by the
use of interpreters if necessary, but it rarely is resolved
entirely.
   ``That's a problem even when we're dealing with the English and
the Canadians,'' said Moorer.

   An American oil worker in Saudi Arabia says
the Persian Gulf crisis ``makes you uneasy, nervous,'' but he and
two other oil workers say they don't believe their lives are in
danger.
   The three Aramco oil company employees said Monday they have
found strong support among Saudi citizens for the massive
deployment of U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia from possible
invasion by Iraq.
   ``The Saudis I've talked to are very much supportive of the
American troops and their presence here,'' said Mike McMahon of
Phoenix, who said he has been in Saudi Arabia working for Aramco
``off and on for 10 years.''
   ``During the Iran-Iraq war when the U.S. ships were in the
Persian Gulf there was a mixed feeling among the Saudis,'' McMahon
said. ``But this time I feel like most everybody is glad to see
them, especially when they first came because of the reports about
the Iraqi troops massing at the border.''
   The three employees said they initially feared Iraqi forces
would continue south into the Saudi kingdom after conquering Kuwait
but now feel reassured that such an attack would be repelled.
   The men work at an Aramco facility in Abqaiq, more than 200
miles south of the Kuwait-Saudi border, near which Iraqi troops
have taken up positions.
   They were interviewed at a hotel elsewhere in Saudi Arabia by a
reporter allowed into the country with a Pentagon media pool.
Guests at the hotel included dozens of Kuwaitis, Britons and others
who fled Kuwait after Iraq attacked on Aug. 2.
   Ground rules for media coverage prohibit disclosure of the exact
location.
   One of the three Aramco workers, Joe Daniel of Eastman, Ga., was
heading home on a flight Monday night. Daniel is a student at the
New Orleans Baptist Seminary who was in Saudi Arabia for a summer
job and had been scheduled to leave sometime this month.
   ``I tried to get out earlier, right after the invasion, but
there was a waiting list,'' Daniel said. ``I wasn't really afraid
but everybody at the (Aramco) camp thought it would be best to go
as soon as possible.''
   Daniel said he called family members the day after the invasion
to let them know he was safe. ``We really don't feel any danger,''
said Daniel, who arrived in Saudi Arabia two months ago.
   Aramco has about 5,000 American workers in Saudi Arabia. About
80 percent of their dependents have left since the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, the men said.
   McMahon said most Americans learned of the Iraqi invasion from
Voice of America and British Broadcasting Corp. broadcasts.
   ``It makes you uneasy, nervous, but I never had personally any
fear for my life,'' said McMahon. ``I've thought from the beginning
that the risk to us was pretty low.''
   He said another Aramco worker, whom he declined to name, went to
the Saudi-Kuwait border shortly after the invasion in an effort to
inquire about family members in Kuwait.
   ``He wasn't able to get in,'' McMahon said. ``Iraqi soldiers
stopped him at the border.''
   The third Aramco worker asked to be identified only by his first
name, Walt, and said he was from Mississippi.
   He said the Americans most worried about the prospect of an
Iraqi invasion of Saudi territory have left ``with most of them
leaving their cars out at the airport. We still believe there is no
real threat here, but any time the military is involved some people
get hysterical.''
   Walt, who said he has worked in Saudi Arabia for seven years,
said that based on his recent conversations with Saudis, he
believes ``(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein has forfeited his
credibility among the Arabs here and they are now very much against
him and very supportive of the U.S. presence.''
   Both Walt and McMahon said they would be leaving Saudi Arabia
soon for scheduled vacations but planned to return.
   ``In some ways I'm sorry to leave at this time,'' McMahon said.
``It's a stressful period for some of our people and I wish I could
stay with them and ride it out.''

<HEAD>Hubble Picture Shows Detail of Star-Forming Area</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hubble Space Telescope can't look to the
edge of the universe until its vision is corrected, but it is
beginning to give scientists unprecedented views of celestial
objects closer to home.
   NASA released the first such photograph on Monday, a detailed
look into a prolific star-forming area, clearly showing 60 stars in
an area once thought to have only a single, massive star.
   ``The picture has exciting scientific content and demonstrates
the Hubble Space Telescope is very much alive,'' said Ed Weiler,
the NASA scientist in charge of the project.
   The picture was made Aug. 3 of a star cluster called 30 Doradus,
located in the constellation Dorado, the swordfish _ an area in the
southern hemisphere known as a star nursery. The cluster is
believed to be 160,000 to 170,000 years old, a baby in a universe
10 billion to 20 billion years old.
   In the photograph, each of the stars had a fuzzy halo caused by
the flaw in making the telescope's mirrors. A computer then took
out the haloes, producing a much crisper image of the stars.
   ``The star-forming region of 30 Doradus is probably the most
prolific area of star formation certainly within several million
light years ... it's almost like the 1950s baby boom in the United
States,'' Weiler said.
   ``In the early 1980s, astronomers studying this object thought
it was just a single star, but a truly super-massive star,'' he
said. Later in the decade, ground-based telescopes resolved the
light into 27 still-massive objects.
   But, said Weiler, the Hubble image clearly shows at least 60
stars so close together that they would fit into the area between
the sun and Alpha Centauri, which at four light years distance is
the star closest to our solar system.
   Dr. Rick White, associate astronomer with the Space Telescope
Science Institute, said the image is 10 times better than the
average image that can be taken from the ground. A photograph of
the region taken from an observatory in Chile showed the star
cluster as a single, bright image.
   ``The haloes are the fault of the error in the mirror, but the
cores of the images are just the same size as the images we would
have had from the space telescope if the mirrors had been
perfect,'' White said.
   But he said, he doesn't want to leave the impression that
computer restoration can rectify the $1.5 billion telescope's
shortcomings.
   ``You can't go back to the original image you would have had
without the error in the mirror,'' White said. ``But what you can
do is get images that have the full fine resolution that the Hubble
telescope would have had and that the telescope still does have.''
   The telescope's wide-field camera and other instruments are
expected to be fitted with corrective lenses early in 1993; NASA
says that should restore the Hubble to its originally planned
capabilities.
   Until then, the telescope won't be able to fulfill its promise
of looking back to the beginning of the universe, nor will it be
able to solve the question of how fast the universe is expanding,
said Professor James Westphal of the California Institute of
Technology, the principal scientist for the wide-field camera.

<HEAD>Barry Changes Political Affiliation; `Leaving Options Open'</HEAD>

   Mayor Marion Barry says he dropped his
Democratic affiliation and declared himself an independent to
``keep my options open'' for a possible political comeback.
   Barry political advisers have said the mayor, who was convicted
Friday of a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge and acquitted of
another, intends to run for a city council seat. But on Monday,
Barry refused to rule out anything _ including another bid for
mayor.
   His trial jury was unable to reach a verdict on 12 charges _
including three felony perjury counts _ and the U.S. attorney has
said he will decide within the next month whether to retry Barry.
   Barry, at a news conference, was asked how it would feel running
against an old colleague who also is seeking an at-large council
seat.
   ``You're assuming I'm not running for mayor,'' Barry retorted.
   Pressed on the issue, Barry said: ``I have a lot of options ...
and I believe I still have a significant contribution to make to
the city I love.''
   Barry announced that he would not run for mayor in June, just
before the start of his drug and perjury trial. Since the deadline
for entering the city's Sept. 11 party primaries ended July 5,
Barry's only chance to get on the ballot for November's general
election is to run as an independent.
   To run for the city-wide council seat, the mayor also must
gather signatures from 3,000 registered voters before Aug. 29. He
would need the same number of signatures to run for mayor.
   Top aides to the mayor suggested Barry is not seriously
considering making a fourth run for the job he has held since 1978.
   ``He thinks he has a much better chance to win a council seat,
even though a mayoral race tempts him,'' said one political aide
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Every indication I am
getting is that he will run for the council.''
   The mayor added Monday that he will make his decision after
taking a few days' vacation this week.
   Barry said that switching his party affiliation ``was not an
easy decision for me.''
   ``My roots go deep in the Democratic Party ... I've been a
Democrat all my adult life,'' Barry said. ``I still believe very
much in the progressive ideals of the Democratic Party, but in
terms of local politics, I decided to change my registration to
keep my options open.''
   Some of Barry's top advisers contend that if Barry re-enters
politics, he is more likely to receive jail time for his cocaine
conviction, sources in his political camp say. Some of the mayor's
followers also believe that U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens would be
more likely to retry the mayor on a dozen charges the jury in his
drug and perjury trial was unable to resolve, the sources added.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department said it will be up to Stephens
to decide whether to bring the case again.
   Stephens ``does not need our permission to retry a case,'' said
Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian, when asked if the
department would participate in the decision. Stephens hasn't yet
said whether he plans to retry the case.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has not yet set a
sentencing date for Barry's misdemeanor cocaine possession
conviction, which could carry a maximum penalty of one year in
prison and a $100,000 fine.
   The mayor rebuffed suggestions that he might run for office
again just to complete 20 years of city government service and
qualify for a pension.
   ``Those who have said that my staying in politics is just for
the pension are insensitive, insulting and just plain insane,''
Barry said. ``Money has never been my primary motivation _
community service was.''

<HEAD>Santa Monica's Patience Tested by Homeless</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A backlash against the homeless has
hit progressive Santa Monica, a city so tolerant it serves street
people free meals on the City Hall lawn.
   Grumbling over the city's benevolence toward the homeless
erupted into a revolt after a vagrant with a pair of scissors
mugged an 89-year-old woman in a grocery store in March.
   Although the man was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in
prison, community activists in this city of 96,500 launched a
campaign to oust City Attorney Robert Myers, blaming his policy
against prosecuting nonviolent homelessness-related crimes.
   ``It's an outrage,'' said activist Leslie Dutton. ``These
policies have encouraged the criminal element to stay in our
community. People are prisoners in their apartments. They're even
afraid to go shopping.''
   Residents complain families and the old people can't go to the
parks. Businesses worry about tourism. Some say the city should
toughen up on the homeless.
   ``We fund over $2 million in social service programs for the
homeless,'' said Councilwoman Christine Reed, a member of the
council's conservative minority. ``The bums and the aggressive
vagrants are people who are coming here to live this lifestyle by
choice. We are making it too comfortable for them.''
   Santa Monica, jokingly called Soviet Monica, has been known over
the years for rent control, limousine liberals and compassion for
everyone but landlords and developers.
   When the homeless population grew in the 1980s, the city
responded with food, referral programs and other services. Every
afternoon, as many as 300 homeless people eat free meals outside
City Hall.
   Meanwhile, Myers chose not to prosecute nonviolent crimes such
as public drunkenness and camping in parks. Instead, he referred
such arrests to social workers. ``Jail does nothing to solve
homelessness,'' Myers said. ``When someone is released from jail,
they're still homeless, they're still on the street.''
   The homeless population here, as in other cities, has risen _
some say because Santa Monica has made itself so inviting. The
parks have become havens for the homeless who sleep under the palm
trees, drink cheap booze from paper bags, beg for change and
defecate on the grass.
   Crime also is on the rise, with a large percentage of rapes and
robberies blamed on vagrants.
   In 1985, 6 percent of rapes were by transients, compared with 42
percent in 1989 and 46 percent for the first five months of this
year, authorities said. Nineteen percent of robberies were by
transients five years ago, compared with 35 percent last year and
49 percent so far in 1990.
   The breaking point for many came when James Earl Tillman
attacked Frances Finnen with a pair of scissors and grabbed her
purse. Tillman was convicted of robbery and assault but acquitted
of attempted murder.
   Activists launched a successful campaign to put on the ballot a
measure to make the appointed city attorney's post an elected
position.
   In blaming Myers, they overlooked misdemeanor charges he filed
against Tillman in an unrelated incident a month before the
mugging, after county prosecutors had declined to file charges.
   Supporters of the city's homeless policies say Myers' critics
are looking for easy solutions to a complicated problem.
   ``American citizens are not very good on chronic pain, whether
it's long-term illness or long-term homelessness,'' said John
Suggs, coordinator of the Westside Shelter Coalition. ``Our society
goes for the quick fix. But this isn't a quick-fix problem.''

<HEAD>Paper Says Barry Verdict a Blow to Fight Against Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Colombia's leading newspaper says the
verdict in the cocaine trial of Washington Mayor Marion Barry is a
``psychological blow'' to the country's war on drug trafficking.
   The verdict, convicting Barry on only one of the 14 charges
against him, was a ``virtual absolution'' of the mayor's crimes,
the Bogota daily El Tiempo said in an editorial Monday.
   Barry was convicted last week on one misdemeanor count of
cocaine possession, which carries a maximum sentence of one year in
jail or a $100,000 fine.
   El Tiempo said the Barry verdict ``will in no way change
Colombia's position'' in fighting drug traffickers. The Barry case
was cited by many Colombian leaders, who have said cocaine
consumption in the United States fuels violence in Colombia.
   During the past year, Colombia has been engaged in an war on
drug traffickers in which some 500 people, including three
presidential candidates, have been killed.

   Glenn Close and Christopher Walken
have begun filming portions of the TV movie ``Sarah, Plain and
Tall'' at a museum here.
   The actors and crew of 55 arrived Monday and transformed the
Stuhr Mmuseum, known for its running steam engine and
turn-of-the-century railroad town, to fit the script. Filming runs
through Wednesday.
   The film, to air on CBS early next year, is taken from Patricia
MacLachlan's 1985 book of the same name, which won the Newberry
Medal for children's literature.
   Miss Close, whose films include ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and ``The
Big Chill,'' plays a woman from Maine who answers a newspaper ad
placed by a widowed prairie farmer in 1910. Walken, who starred in
``The Deer Hunter,'' plays the lonely farmer seeking a mother for
his two young children.

   Country singer George Strait, San Antonio
Spurs owner Red McCombs and former Gov. Dolph Briscoe have the
dubious honor of being among the city's top 10 users of water, the
City Water Board says.
   Water experts said their usage was up to 30 times the 11,220
gallons of water consumed by the average home.
   ``Oh my gosh, the water use has been much too high,'' Briscoe
said Monday. He was billed an average of 182,512 gallons per month.
   Strait lives on 1.12 acres and uses a monthly average of 222,156
gallons. Kay West, a spokeswoman for Strait, had no comment on the
report Monday.
   McCombs, whose usage was said to average 284,240 gallons a
month, said he and the water board have had disagreements for more
than a year over the meter readings. But he added, ``Even if it is
half-accurate, it would not be acceptable.''
   San Antonio and surrounding areas enacted mandatory water
conservation measures earlier this summer after water levels in the
ground dropped dangerously low. The standards were relaxed after
heavy rain last month.

   Tammy Bakker's church can hold services at
its warehouse ministry here Sunday after winning a zoning dispute.
   The Orange County Commission on Monday overruled 4-1 the county
zoning board and said the site of Mrs. Bakker's New Covenant
Ministries would not be unsafe for church services and a radio-TV
broadcast studio.
   Mrs. Bakker began holding services earlier this year at the site
but was ordered to stop because her permit called only for
operation of the studio.
   Mrs. Bakker said she was ``delighted and very grateful'' about
Monday's ruling. She said her husband, Jim Bakker, will be happy as
well.
   Bakker is serving a 45-year prison term for bilking $3.7 million
from followers of his PTL ministry. The Bakkers moved to Florida
and established the Orlando ministry shortly before his conviction
last year.

<HEAD>4-Year-Old Gets Sister's Umbilical Cord Blood to Fight Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a medical first, five tablespoons of
umbilical cord blood saved after the birth of a baby were given to
her 4-year-old brother in hopes it will help him form new bone
marrow and beat fast-acting leukemia.
   Michael Sancilio received the transfusion at Johns Hopkins
Oncology Center on Monday.
   His 3-month-old sister, Christina, is too young to donate bone
marrow, the usual treatment for Michael's form of leukemia, and
doctors were afraid he wouldn't survive the three-month wait before
his sister became old enough.
   ``We didn't have any other choice,'' said the youngsters'
mother, Denise Sancilio. ``We couldn't put our baby through a bone
marrow aspiration. It's very dangerous for her. We were in a
situation where we had to do it.''
   It was the first time the rare operation was undertaken to treat
leukemia, an often fatal blood cancer. It has been performed three
other times, once in Cincinnati and twice in France, to treat a
different disease, Fanconi's anemia.
   Umbilical cord blood is rich in stem cells, used by the
recipient to form marrow. Doctors said they will know in about
three weeks whether the operation worked.
   Michael, who has juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia, is at
extreme risk of infection in the meantime because his cancerous
bone marrow had to be destroyed as part of the treatment. Marrow is
critical to the immune system.
   ``He's been on and off sleeping all day,'' Michael's father,
Tony, said Monday night. ``This afternoon he got up and walked down
the hall and to the children's playroom. He's up and alert. A
little groggy but holding his own.''
   Mrs. Sancilio said she was 7{ months pregnant with Christina
when she learned Michael had a form of leukemia that cannot be
controlled with drugs and usually kills within a year of diagnosis.
   The umbilical cord blood was frozen when Christina was born May
1. A total of 2.7 ounces were given to Michael after chemotherapy
to destroy his cancerous marrow.
   The transplant carries the same risk as a bone-marrow
transplant. Besides the risk of infection, the body often rejects
foreign cells.
   Michael's blood type does not match his sister's, but doctors
found that he was not overly likely to reject the umbilical cord
blood.
   Tests on Michael's parents and his 7-year-old brother, also
named Tony, showed they were not compatible marrow donors. The
family lives in Virginia Beach, Va.
   ``The odds were we thought he had the chance of surviving for a
couple of months, but it was unknown when the disease would
accelerate and become life-threatening,'' said Dr. John Wagner.
``We decided to go ahead and take the chance on the cord blood
rather than waiting until the donor was old enough.''
   If the transfusion works, it could lead to creation of a bank of
umbilical cord blood to aid similarly afflicted youngsters, doctors
said.
   The transfusion can be performed only on young children because
not enough blood is in the umbilical cord for use with adults, said
Dr. Richard Champlin, chief of the bone-marrow transplant program
at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
   ``In the long run it could provide the potential to protect and
store umbilical blood from every baby and create a bank of cells
for transplantation that could be used if a patient didn't have a
donor within the family,'' he said.

flat at the nation's box office, while ``Flatliners,'' a medical
mystery about death, commanded a lively $10 million for first place
in weekend ticket sales.
   In second, and now clearly the biggest surprise summer hit, was
the Patrick Swayze film ``Ghost,'' making $9.5 million. Third was
Mel Gibson's new war drama, ``Air America,'' which took in $8.1
million.
   According to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
``The Two Jakes,'' starring Jack Nicholson as private eye Jake
Gittes, finished in seventh place.
   ```Two Jakes' is obviously a flop,'' said John Krier, president
of Exhibitor Relations.
   A follow-up to 1974's acclaimed ``Chinatown,'' ``The Two Jakes''
also was directed by Nicholson.
   ``Flatliners,'' about young medical students who flirt with
death, made a robust debut. It stars Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon
and Julia Roberts.
   ``Presumed Innocent,'' the adaptation of Scott Turow's
best-selling murder mystery, finished in fourth with $7.9 million.
In fifth, continuing strongly despite withering reviews, was
``Problem Child,'' collecting $4.8 million.
   ``Young Guns II,'' the Brat-Pack-in-chaps Western, fell from
third to sixth place, rounding up $4.7 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Flatliners,'' Columbia, $10 million, 1,319 screens, $7,608
per screen, $10 million, one week.
   2. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $9.5 million, 1,766 screens, $5,353 per
screen, $85.5 million, five weeks.
   3. ``Air America,'' Tri-Star, $8.1 million, 1,902 screens,
$4,240 per screen, $8.1 million, one week.
   4. ``Presumed Innocent,'' Warner Bros. $7.9 million, 1,451
screens, $5,446 per screen, $42 million, three weeks.
   5. ``Problem Child,'' Universal, $4.8 million, 1,769 screens,
$2,740 per screen, $31.2 million, three weeks.

<HEAD>Device Defused at Home of Former Northern Ireland Commander</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOULSFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have safely defused a suspected
IRA bomb discovered in the garden of a former British army
commander in Northern Ireland.
   About 20 people from surrounding homes were evacuated after the
device was found Monday attached to a garden-hose reel behind the
house of Sir Anthony Farrar-Hockley in Moulsford, 30 miles west of
London.
   ``I can confirm that it definitely was an explosive device. It
has been made safe,'' said Chief Constable Colin Smith of Thames
Valley Police.
   The Irish Republican Army, which has killed two people in an
intensified bombing campaign in England this year, was suspected,
police said. There was no claim of responsiblity.
   It was the third consecutive Monday in which there was a bombing
incident in southern England.
   The first killed Ian Gow, a member of Parliament and close
friend of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, at his home in Hankham,
65 miles southeast of London.
   The second fell off a car at a home in London once owned by a
British government official but now occupied by an American. The
device did not explode.
   Farrar-Hockley took command of British Forces in 1970, the year
after they were sent to Northern Ireland to separate warring
Protestants and Roman Catholics. He left Northern Ireland in 1971,
and retired in 1983.
   The IRA has attacked military offices, London's Stock Exchange
and a club associated with the governing Conservative Party this
year in its campaign to undermine British rule in Northern Ireland.
   The IRA, which is outlawed in Britain and Ireland, says it seeks
to unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Republic of
Ireland, which is 95 percent Catholic.

<HEAD>`Cat' Cartoonist B. Kliban Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoonist B. Kliban, an art-school washout
with a childhood allergy to cats whose drawings of plump, striped
felines went from the pages of Playboy to greater fame on T-shirts
and calendars, has died at 55.
   Kliban, who lived in Corte Madera, died Sunday at the University
of California at San Francisco Medical Center. The cause of death
was not immediately known, but Kliban had undergone heart surgery
there July 31.
   The cartoonist's droll, round-eyed cats often pursued human
activities. They worked at the office, strummed guitars, skied and
spent summers at the beach.
   Books with his cartoons include ``Cat,'' ``Tiny Footprints'' and
``Playboy's Kliban.''
   Kliban's cat-design T-shirts included a best seller with the
caption: ``Sex, Mice and Rock And Roll.'' A popular poster
featuring a Kliban cat read, ``Cat: one hell of a nice animal,
frequently mistaken for a meatloaf.''
   His cats also were on calendars, bed sheets, bath mats, beer
mugs and umbrellas.
   Neiman-Marcus, the posh department store, put a non-feline
Kliban _ camels toting rainbows _ on its shopping bags and catalogs
in 1981. Harrods, the exclusive London department store, and
Bloomingdale's put on big Kliban displays.
   Bernard Kliban said he was born in Connecticut on New Year's Day
and thus got the nickname ``Hap,'' for ``Happy New Year.''
   He said he had had an allegery to cats until he hit his 20's. At
his death, he had four cats.
   He flunked out of Pratt Institute and Cooper Union before he
went to California in 1959 and began drawing for Playboy in the
mid-1970s. In his pre-cat days, he said, he drew ads, corporate
logos and annual reports.
   As his fame grew, Kliban tried to avoid publicity. He stopped
giving out his first name, admitting to just the initial ``B.''
   Kliban said in an interview that if cartoonists ruled the world,
``there would be weird cartoon sculptures 500 feet high and free
rubber chickens, regardless of a person's religious beliefs.''
   Survivors include his wife, Judith, and two daughters.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

<HEAD>Ohio Woman May Get Dodge Pickup for Rejecting Car</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Ohio woman who turned down a $17,000 Honda
she won because it was made with non-union labor will get a
union-made truck from an appreciative AFL-CIO.
   ``I don't want that Honda. I am union,'' Pamela Richards told
game show officials last week when she won an Accord on the Ohio
lottery show ``Cash Explosion Double Play.'' She took a $1,000 cash
prize instead.
   AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty explained Monday why the union
decided to give her a vehicle: ``What we're trying to do is show
that that's the point of view of a lot of people in this country,
and they can't get their message out.''
   The Honda that Richards rejected was made at a plant in
Marysville, Ohio., where labor leaders contend the Japanese
automaker has used union-busting tactics to keep United Auto
Workers from organizing.
   Richards, a 23-year UAW member who lives in Risingsun, Ohio,
wants a Dodge Dakota pickup, Hardesty said. Top-of-the-line Dakota
trucks sell for between $16,000 and $20,000.

<HEAD>New OPEC Meeting Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States
says oil-producing countries will meet soon to discuss how they
should handle oil shortages that have resulted since Iraq invaded
Kuwait.
   ``There will be an OPEC meeting soon,'' Prince Bandar Bin Sultan
said Monday at a briefing for reporters. He said members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are holding
``consultations'' in preparation for the meeting.
   He declined to say when and where the OPEC meeting would be
held. Earlier he had said the Saudis would like ``to have a stable
and predictable market for oil.''
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 _ and subsequent sanctions
against those countries _ have cut by 4 million barrels a day the
amount of oil available on the world markets.
   Charles DiBona, chairman of the American Petroleum Institute,
said Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have both indicated a willingness
to help ease shortages.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Mail Policy Defended By Postmaster General</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service, criticized for refusing to
automatically forward nursing home residents' mail when they move,
says the policy is ``cost-effective and practical.''
   But Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said in a letter he was
disturbed by reports that well-traveled nursing home residents'
mail was being left behind.
   ``I understand you are aware of places where improper mail
forwarding has caused a hardship for nursing home residents,''
Frank said in the letter to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa. ``I am very
concerned with such reports and can assure you the Postal Service
is committed to resolving any problems which may exist,'' Frank
said.
   The letter was released Monday by Heinz, ranking Republican on
the Senate Special Committee on Aging.
   The Postal Service and the Aging Committee have agreed to
collaborate on a campaign to ensure that nursing homes are
re-addressing the mail of residents who have left, the committee
said. Also, Frank said the agency has formed an internal committee
to study the matter further.
   Because all residents of a nursing home are at the same address,
the Postal Service says the home should be the agent for their
mail. The mail is delivered in bulk and distributed by the
institution.
   While other people may submit change-of-address cards to local
post offices, nursing home residents must rely on the institution
to write their new address on individual letters. Then, the post
office delivers it at no extra charge.
   Heinz questioned the policy in a March letter to Frank.
   Frank defended the policy as ``the most cost-effective and
practical way for postal services to be provided to residents of
nursing homes.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Acts to Restore the Rights of Stalin's Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has acted to
restore the rights of victims of Josef Stalin, under whose rule
millions of peasants died of starvation, were shot or sent to labor
camps as ``enemies of the people.''
   In his toughest condemnation yet of Stalin's forced
collectivization of agriculture, which began in the late 1920s,
Gorbachev said Monday that thousands of innocent people still bore
a ``stain of injustice.''
   In a sweeping decree, Gorbachev said the ``repressions conducted
... during the period of collectivization'' were ``unlawful and
contradictory to the main civilian and economic rights of human
beings.''
   He condemned repressions against ``all citizens on political,
social, ethnic, religious and other motives in the 1920s through
the 1950s,'' and moved ``to completely reinstate the rights of
these citizens.''
   Gorbachev said the Soviet Union was taking this action now,
because ``our society ... has chosen the path of moral revival,
democracy and legality.''
   The decree orders the government of the Soviet Union and its
republics to submit, before Oct. 1, proposals to legislatures on
restoring the rights of repressed citizens. Gorbachev also
empowered his top advisory group, the Presidential Council, to
supervise the actions.
   The decree, however, excludes those ``lawfully sentenced for
crimes against the motherland and against the Soviet people''
during World War II and in the prewar and postwar years.
   It orders the Soviet government to draft legislation defining
the crimes that are not subject to rehabilitation.
   The decree also does not consider what compensation, if any,
victims should receive. An informal political group, called
Memorial, has demanded compensation and restoration of rights for
Stalin's victims.
   A special commission to study the victims of Stalinist
repression has already rehabilitated thousands.
   ``But even now, thousands of cases haven't been considered,''
Gorbachev said in his decree. ``A stain of injustice hasn't been
removed from the innocent Soviet people who suffered during forced
collectivization, who were sentenced, deported with their families
to remote regions without means of existence, without a right of
appeal, and without even being aware of the term of their
sentence.''
   The decree urges specifically that clergymen and citizens
persecuted for religious motives should be rehabilitated. Under
Stalin, thousands of priests were shot and religious worship was
sharply curtailed.
   In a landmark speech in November 1987, Gorbachev accused Stalin,
who ruled the Soviet Union from 1924-53, of ``enormous and
unforgivable'' crimes.
   But in that speech, he also called Stalin's collectivization ``a
transformation of great importance.''
   In Monday's decree, there was no such equivocation.
   ``Thousands of people were subject to moral and physical
torture,'' it said. ``Many of them were annihilated. The lives of
their families and next of kin were turned into one of humiliation
and suffering without any hope.''
   Western historians say as many as 20 million people were shot,
starved to death in famines the Kremlin did everything to
encourage, or simply vanished into the gulag during Stalin's reign
of terror.
   Thousands of Stalin's victims were released from labor camps and
rehabilitated after Nikita S. Khrushchev denounced the dictator in
a secret speech to the party in 1956, three years after Stalin died.

<HEAD>Armenian Parliament Elects New Prime Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government of Soviet Armenia has resigned and
the republic's Parliament has elected an Armenian nationalist as
the new prime minister, the Tass news agency reported.
   Lawmakers on Monday elected Vazgen Manukyan, leader of the
Armenian National Movement, with a vote of 170-35, Tass said.
   He replaces Vladimir Markaryants who, along with his government,
resigned earlier the same day, Armenian radio reported.
   It was not immediately clear why Armenia's government resigned,
although the move appeared linked to Parliament's Aug. 4 election
of a new president, Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Manukyan, 44, was
nominated by Ter-Petrosyan.
   Both new leaders are prominent figures in the Armenian National
Movement and the Karabakh Committee, a group seeking Armenian
control over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, located
inside neighboring Azerbaijan.
   With Manukyan's election, Ter-Petrosyan told Parliament, ``We
have proved that we have a strong power that should become a
guarantee of stability of the political situation in the
republic,'' the Interfax news service reported.
   Manukyan is expected to form a new Cabinet within a month, Tass
said.
   Hundreds of people have died in the last two years in bitter
clashes between Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis over
control of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. The mostly Armenian
region has been controlled by Azerbaijan since the 1920s.

<HEAD>Buffalo Mafia Investigation Relies on Lackluster Informants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Mafia ``canaries'' raised the FBI's
hopes of bringing down Buffalo's mob bosses _ until one informant
stopped singing and the other didn't know the song law enforcement
agents wanted to hear.
   John C. Sacco Jr., a reputed top mob enforcer, allegedly
returned to a life of crime after giving the FBI bad information.
And Ronald M. Fino, the son of a former Buffalo crime boss,
produced less information than agents expected.
   Securing the cooperation of the two organized crime insiders had
given the FBI confidence that indictments could be obtained against
the local Mafia elite.
   Sacco's defection, in particular, had thrilled authorities
because his adherence to the mob's code of silence had been legend.
``Nobody shot me,'' he once told police while bleeding from three
gunshot wounds.
   But Sacco now is in jail, accused of dealing cocaine,
loansharking and trying to arrange at least one killing while on
the FBI's payroll.
   ``This is what happens when the FBI takes people like Sacco, who
make a lifetime of lying, and try dipping them into the River
Jordan and then calling them clean government witnesses,'' said
Paul J. Cambria Jr., a defense lawyer.
   Fino's testimony helped convict three men on labor-racketeering
charges, but prosecutors became disenchanted with him because he
failed to produce information that could bring down the leaders of
Buffalo's crime family.
   U.S. Attorney Dennis C. Vacco did not return telephone calls but
has been quoted as saying, ``I like it better when there is less
publicity about Ron Fino.''
   G. Robert Langford, agent in charge of Buffalo's FBI office,
said the mob investigation is still going forward. He predicted
that Buffalo's organized-crime leaders would be indicted within the
next year.
   He acknowledged that Sacco's backsliding slowed the
investigation.
   ``We had put a lot of the direction of the investigation based
on the information he had been giving us,'' Langford said. ``Now
we've got to go in different directions.''
   Buffalo's mob family does not play as large a role now as it did
more than 30 years ago, when its boss, Stefano Maggadino, sat on
the Mafia's governing national commission.
   Its membership has been declining and it does not control the
city's drug trade. But it still runs plenty of gambling and
loansharking operations, Langford said.
   It is also intertwined with Local 210 of the Laborers Union,
according to law enforcement agents. Fino became the local's
business manager in 1973 and became an FBI informant a short time
later.
   In an interview recently in The Wall Street Journal, Fino said
his main role was to provide information on underworld influence in
the union.
   He said that he was not a member of the Mafia but that figures
such as Anthony Liberatore, a former Laborers official and alleged
mob figure in Cleveland, trusted him because they knew his father,
the late Joseph Fino, Buffalo's mob boss from 1968 to 1972.
   But Fino said there are limits to the information he can provide
_ which is why Sacco would have been such an important informant.
   ``He was directly involved in crime that I wouldn't be,'' Fino
said in March. ``Much of my involvement is in subtler areas: labor
corruption, political corruption, the intertwining of organized
crime.''
   Sacco, who began cooperating with the FBI in June 1989, was
expected to help solve several murders and provide up-to-date
information about mob leaders, including reputed boss Joseph E.
Todaro Jr. But sometime last spring, things began to go wrong.
   ``He gave us a lot of good information, and then for whatever
reason _ you'd have to ask him _ he changed his mind and started
giving us bad information,'' Langford said. ``He started lying to
us, and that was the end of the deal.''
   Nurturing informants is a delicate task, and it is not uncommon
for them to slide back into the criminal life, Langford added.
``They start cooperating and get scared, or they just fall back
into the old ways,'' he said.
   Fino knows what the pressure can do to an informant. His wife
divorced him after he sought FBI protection. The mob has reportedly
put out a contract on him. Fear for his safety kept him from
attending his mother's funeral last winter.
   ``I try to live a halfway normal life,'' he told the Journal.
``But it's difficult. I can't go and come like a normal person. The
toughest thing is my children _ I don't see them.
   ``Would I do it again?'' he asked. ``No. The price is too
expensive.''

   A crowd angry over a Mohawk blockade
of a St. Lawrence River bridge tossed firebombs and ball bearings
at more than 200 federal and provincial police. Twenty-five people
were reported arrested.
   Police fired two rounds of tear gas to disperse the crowd Monday
night, the second straight night of anti-Mohawk demonstrations near
the Mercier Bridge.
   Mohawks have blocked the bridge since July 11 in sympathy with a
Mohawk protest 18 miles away at Oka. The blockade has forced
residents to take long detours to Montreal.
   The slogan-shouting crowd included about 100 youngsters armed
with baseball bats and tire irons who tossed firebombs, rocks, and
ball bearings at the police.
   Police chased the demonstrators through the streets of
Chateauguay, a city of 50,000. Police said 25 people were arrested.
   The Mohawks at Oka have for several months been manning a
barricade to stop the town from expanding its golf course onto
Indian-claimed land. That standoff led to a July 11 gunbattle
between Indians and Quebec police. One police officer died in the
gun battle, though it is not yet clear whether he was shot by
Mohawks or his own men in the melee. The two sides have faced each
other across barricades since then.
   Residents nearer Montreal have become increasingly frustrated at
the sympathy barricade Mohawks built at the Mercier Bridge, the
main commuter span over the St. Lawrence River. The almost nightly
counter-protests erupted into a a four-hour riot Sunday night.
   Yvon Poitras, leader of a group of Chateauguay residents
protesting the blockade, said the provincial government should
bring in the army, which has been on standby since last week at the
request of Premier Robert Bourassa.
   ``If the army doesn't come in to Chateauguay to replace the
police on the barricade, then we will have a bloodbath,'' said the
former provincial police officer.
   Police and demonstrators clashed Sunday night. Riot police moved
in with clubs to remove the protesters.
   Later, the police used tear gas to disperse an angry crowd that
had swelled to more than 5,000. The protesters threw bricks and
rocks at the police. Twenty-five people were arrested.
   There were no serious injuries but many of those involved said
the police used excessive force.
   Meanwhile, the Mohawks and the federal and provincial
governments have agreed to start negotiations to bring down the
barricades.
   Quebec Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia said Sunday that the
talks were expected to start within two days, after a team of 24
international observers chosen by the International Federation of
Human Rights arrives.

   Most Americans believe an international economic
embargo will fail to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait, but most also
oppose U.S. military strikes to achieve that goal, an Associated
Press poll has found.
   At the same time, half the respondents to the national survey
said they fear the Iraqi conflict will create an oil crisis in the
United States in the next few months, with rising prices and long
lines at the gas pump.
   Despite that fear, and despite widespread expectations of a
U.S.-Iraq war, the poll found strong support for the use of U.S.
troops to defend Saudi Arabia against possible Iraqi attack.
Sixty-four percent approved.
   The survey of 1,004 adults was conducted Wednesday through
Sunday, starting the day President Bush said he was sending troops.
That same day, Iraq announced it was annexing Kuwait, which it
invaded the week before.
   Several polls have found Americans rallying behind Bush. Support
for the use of U.S. troops ranged from 63 percent in a poll Tuesday
and Wednesday last week to 81 percent in a one-day poll Wednesday
night.
   Support for Bush personally is about as high. Seventy-seven
percent in a poll Friday to Sunday by ICR Survey Research Group
generally approved of his handling of the situation. And two-thirds
said his reaction has been ``about right,'' rather than too tough
or too weak.
   But concerns underlie the support. In the AP poll, also
conducted by ICR, 33 percent said the United States is ``very
likely'' to become involved in a war with Iraq, and 39 percent
called war ``somewhat likely.''
   Republicans were more supportive of the U.S. troop commitment
than were Democrats and independents _ 74 percent, compared with 61
and 63 percent respectively.
   College-educated Americans also were more supportive of the use
of U.S. troops. Women were far less supportive than were men, 51
percent to 79 percent.
   Bush has said Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ``will not stand.'' But
poll respondents were less clear on that outcome: Just one-third
expected the economic embargo of Iraq to succeed in forcing it out
of Kuwait.
   Many did not favor a military alternative. Thirty-five percent
backed the use of U.S. troops to try to push Iraq out of Kuwait,
and even fewer _ 27 percent _ favored bombing Iraqi military
targets to force it from Kuwait.
   Concerning oil, an overwhelming 86 percent said oil companies
were taking advantage of the situation when they raised gasoline
prices after Iraq attacked Kuwait; just 6 percent called the
increases legitimate, with the rest unsure.
   But many expected a true oil crisis: Fifty-two percent said they
believe the situation in the Middle East is likely to create oil
shortages in the next few months, with higher prices and
gas-station lines.
   The AP poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points. ICR, of Media, Pa., is part of AUS Consultant
Cos.

<TEXT>
   This Associated Press poll was conducted by
telephone Aug. 8-12 among a random sample of 1,004 adults in the
continental United States. Interviewing was done by ICR Survey
Research Group of Media, Pa.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that 19
of 20 times its findings should be within three points of the
result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The
error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Do you support or oppose sending U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia
to help defend it against a possible Iraqi attack? Support: 64
percent. Oppose: 22 percent. Don't know or no answer: 14 percent.
   2. How likely do you think the United States is to become
involved in a war with Iraq _ do you think this is very likely,
somewhat likely, not too likely or not likely at all? Very: 33.
Somewhat: 39. Not too: 17. Not at all: 6. DK-NA: 6.
   3. An international economic embargo of Iraq has begun. Do you
think the economic embargo will succeed in forcing Iraq out of
Kuwait, or not? Yes: 33. No: 43. Maybe: 7. DK-NA: 18.
   4. Do you think the United States should bomb Iraqi military
targets to force Iraq out of Kuwait, or not? Yes: 27. No: 59.
DK-NA: 13.
   5. Do you think the United States should use U.S. ground troops
to try to push Iraq out of Kuwait, or not? Yes: 35. No: 52. DK-NA:
13.
   6. Do you think the recent increases in gasoline prices in the
United States are a legitimate result of Iraq's attack on Kuwait,
or do you think the oil companies are taking advantage of the
situation and raising prices unfairly? Legitimate: 6. Unfair: 86.
Partly both: 3. DK-NA: 5.
   7. Do you think the situation in the Middle East is likely to
create oil shortages in the next few months, with rising prices and
long lines at the service stations, or don't you think that's
likely? Likely: 52. Not likely: 42. DK-NA: 7.

<HEAD>Paper: Four Belgian Captives to Be Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beirut newspaper claimed today the
radical Palestinian faction of terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal would
release four Belgian hostages Wednesday.
   A Belgian government source dismissed the report by the
newspaper Al-Lima, saying ``it is not the first time this paper has
had a story like that.'' The official spoke on condition of
anonymity in Brussels.
   The front-page report, attributed to unidentified Western
diplomatic sources, said the four would be released Wednesday in a
deal that includes the release of convicted Palestinian terrorist
Sa'eed Nasser ``by a special pardon signed by the king of Belgium.''
   It said the deal was worked out between Belgian officials and
Fatah-Revolutionary Council and a Belgian press team is to arrive
in Lebanon ``in the next few hours to cover the release of the four
hostages.'' It did not disclose further details.
   The newspaper does not have a record of accurate reporting on
the issue of the Belgian captives. A similar report last month
predicting the hostages' July 21 release proved unfounded.
   Walid Khaled, Fatah-RC spokesman on the hostage issue, also
declined to discuss the report.``We'll inform you of any
developments,'' Khaled said in an interview.
   Fatah-RC said in 1987 it seized the four Belgians aboard their
boat, Silco, off the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip. Newspapers have
reported the hostages were kept in Libya, and that they had been
abducted by the Libyan navy, not by Abu Nidal's group.
   They are Emmanuel Houtekins, 44, his wife, Godlieve Kets, 50,
their son, Laurent, 20, and daughter, Valerie, 18.
   Five other people were seized with them, including three
children. Two of the children were freed in 1988 and the rest last
April.
   Sa'eed, believed to be a Fatah-RC member, is serving a life
sentence in Belgium for killing a Jewish youth and injuring 20
others in a 1980 grenade attack. He became eligible for parole July
27.
   Several unconfirmed news reports have said Belgian authorities
would pardon the Palestinian terrorist in exchange for release of
the four hostages.
   Because the Belgian captives are not believed held in Lebanon,
they are not classified among the 14 Western hostages kidnapped
mainly by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions. Six Americans are
among those Western hostages. The longest held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Six Servicemen Die in Training Exercise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMILTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six soldiers died when a blizzard
trapped them during a winter training exercise, officials said
today.
   Police spokesman Sgt. Darryl Nix said the bodies were found
Monday only 150 yards from an emergency shelter on 9,177-foot Mount
Ruapehu. The hut has six bunks and emergency rations, but it ``may
as well have been 150 miles in those conditions,'' Nix said.
   The bodies will remain on the mountain until the weather clears
so rescue teams and helicopters can move in safely. It was raining
heavily today.
   The victims, ranging in age from 18 to 23, were part of a
13-member army and navy group which had been on the mountain since
Thursday as part of an adventure training course. When a blizzard
cut off their escape from the mountain, they were forced to dig in.
   Two of the soldiers began an 11-hour trek Sunday night to find
help. When a search party reached the group Monday afternoon, six
already were dead. The other five were brought down for treatment
of exposure.
   Parliament observed a minute's silence for the victims today. A
military court of inquiry into the deaths was scheduled to begin
Wednesday.
   Mount Ruapehu is in the rugged center of New Zealand's North
Island, about 100 miles south of Hamilton.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke's decision to
send Navy ships to the Persian Gulf is proving controversial in a
country sensitive to any suggestions that it serves U.S. interests.
   The painful memory of involvement in Vietnam, Korea and
virtually every other major conflict this century also has made
Australians nervous about sending two guided-missile frigates, a
supply ship and some 600 men to a conflict halfway around the globe.
   While Hawke's decision has been supported by the opposition, it
has been criticized by the Arab community, small political parties,
environmental and peace groups, and even some members of his own
Labor Party.
   President Bush called Hawke on Friday to ask for an Australian
contingent to participate in the attempt to stop Iraqi shipping to
punish Baghdad for invading Kuwait.
   After the 20-minute chat, Hawke reportedly consulted with
several key ministers. Then, without a formal Cabinet meeting, he
announced he would send three ships, citing ``the gravity of the
situation.''
   The opposition Liberal party backed the move, but Janet Powell,
leader of the Democratic Party, called Hawke's decision
``ill-considered, dangerous and undemocratic.''
   ``Yet again, we have taken military action in a knee-jerk
response to a request from the United States,'' she said.
   ``Tough diplomacy and sanctions, backed up by the U.N. policing,
if needed, is the only way out of this mess. Any military
`solution,' which would involve invading Kuwait and probably Iraq,
could well spark chemical and nuclear warfare.''
   The New Left Party in Victoria state also backed a U.N.
settlement of the crisis.
   El Telegraph, an Arabic-language newspaper with a circulation of
about 30,000, said a survey it was conducting of Australia's Arab
community showed overwhelming condemnation of Hawke's decision.
   Hawke on Monday compared his critics to the politicians who
tried to appease Nazi Germany.
   ``The crimes of the appeasers were, in a sense, as great as the
crimes of Hitler and the Nazis,'' he told reporters while attending
farewell ceremonies for the frigates.
   ``We wouldn't have had the Second World War if there hadn't been
appeasers .... You can't stand idly by and allow those things to
happen.''
   Australia's interests in the gulf are primarily export-related,
although about 127 Australians have been unable to leave Iraq and
Kuwait.

<HEAD>Former Time Editor Hedley Donovan Dead at 76</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS graf with memorial service.</NOTE>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY51 of Aug. 13</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hedley Donovan, the former editor in chief at
Time Inc. who oversaw the growth of Sports Illustrated, the
founding of Money magazine and People and the re-birth of Life, has
died at age 76.
   He died Monday at New York Hospital of an acute infection, the
hospital said. He had a chronic lung condition.
   Donovan took over Time Inc. in 1964 as the hand-picked successor
of Henry Luce, the staunch conservative who founded the magazine
and had been its only editor in chief. Donovan gave Time a less
ideological stance. He retired in 1979.
   He was responsible for the content of some of the nation's most
widely read magazines. Time, Life, Fortune and Sports Illustrated
had a combined circulation of more than 13 million in the United
States and 50 million worldwide.
   Donovan also presided over the growth of Sports Illustrated's
popularity, the founding of Money in 1972 and of People two years
later and the success of Time-Life books.
   The once-popular weekly Life was suspended in 1972, but the
photo magazine was resurrected as a monthly.
   Donovan also regulated the tradition under Luce of separating
Time magazine's business and news operations. He created what came
to be known as the Donovan Doctrine, which made the editor in chief
answerable only to the board of directors.
   Donovan once said he tried to make Time magazine ``more
thoughtful and more fair-minded.''
   During his 15-year tenure _ which included the Vietnam War and
Watergate scandal _ Time magazine stopped reflecting the
conservative views of Luce, a staunch Republican with strong views
on communism, China and other subjects.
   Donovan enjoyed the access his position afforded him to
presidents, popes and other world figures. The job was
``wonderful,'' Donovan said, ``one in which it is impossible to
say, `This is work and that is fun.'''
   On retirement, he became a non-salaried adviser to President
Carter. He left before the 1980 election.
   Donovan wrote ``From Roosevelt to Reagan: A Reporter's
Encounters with Nine Presidents,'' in 1985, and an autobiography,
``Right Places, Right Times: Forty Years in Journalism, Not
Counting My Paper Route,'' published in 1989.
   Hedley Williams Donovan was born in Brainerd, Minn., the son of
a mining engineer. He graduated magna cum laude from the University
of Minnesota in 1934. He won a Rhodes scholarship and studied in
1936 at Oxford University, where he was campus correspondent for
United Press.
   In 1937, he joined The Washington Post. He went on to cover
Congress, the State Department and the White House. He left to
serve in Naval intelligence in World War II. After the war, he
joined Fortune, a Time-Life publication.
   He was named an associate editor at Fortune in 1951 and managing
editor in 1953. He held that post until 1959, when Luce, looking
for a potential successor after suffering a serious heart attack,
made Donovan his chief deputy.
   Donovan was also a director of the Council on Foreign Relations,
a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member
of the Trilateral Commission.
   He lived in New York City and Sands Point, N.Y.
   He is survived by two sons and a daughter. His wife, Dorothy,
died in 1978.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Thursday at the
Congregational Church of Manhasset, on New York's Long Island.

<HEAD>Elvis Sightings No Longer Big Talk at Death Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As the faithful gather for the 13th
anniversary of Elvis Presley's death, the question this year is not
whether the King is really gone but whether he was a victim of
suicide, accident or murder.
   Authors of a soon-to-be-published book say they'll give the
first detailed report on his autopsy and show that Presley, a
pill-popper of the first order, miscalculated the combined effect
of various uppers and downers and died of an overdose.
   That not-surprising conclusion comes from Charles Thompson II
and James P. Cole, authors of ``The Death of Elvis Presley,'' to be
published in January by Delacorte Press.
   ``The conclusion is inescapable that this was an accidental drug
overdose,'' said Cole, a former reporter and editor for two Memphis
newspapers.
   Thompson, a ``60 Minutes'' producer, said he and Cole obtained
from one of several doctors who worked on Presley's autopsy the
sealed autopsy records they had sought for 11 years. The Shelby
County medical examiner said Presley died of heart disease and the
autopsy report was sealed at the family's request.
   Presley died Aug. 16, 1977 at his Memphis estate, Graceland, now
a tourist attraction drawing more than 600,000 visitors a year.
Graceland managers say up to 10,000 Elvis fans will take part this
week in events tied to the anniversary of his death.
   Presley's abuse of prescription drugs has been discussed often
in print and in court since 1977, but at the time of his death,
friends and family wanted to keep down such talk ``to make the
hometown boy look as good as possible,'' Cole said.
   ``Now we've got the complete record and people will be able to
see for themselves what the documentation is,'' he said.
   At the Elvis anniversary two years ago, the hot talk was about a
new book titled ``Is Elvis Alive?'' A flurry of Elvis sightings at
fast-food restaurants and other sites around the country soon
followed. Now there are new Elvis reports.
   Albert Goldman, author of the 1981 biography ``Elvis,'' said in
a recent article in Life magazine that Presley killed himself with
an intentional overdose.
   Murray Silver, co-author of a book on Jerry Lee Lewis, has been
talking to publishers about an Elvis book to be written with the
singer's former physician. Silver's book reportedly would say
Presley suffered a blow to the neck, perhaps a karate chop, shortly
before his death.
   Todd Morgan, a spokesman for Graceland, said managers of the
Presley estate still believe the original conclusion: heart disease.
   ``We're not going to go head to head with the people who write
these books. There's no benefit to it,'' Morgan said. ``Our getting
into a big row with people like that just triples the publicity for
their books.''
   And anyway, he said, the public is ``getting pretty tired'' of
the stories.

   Wilson personally modeled his winning entry: a double-breasted,

   A woman who weighs 367 and stands 5 feet, 6{
inches tall is fighting for her driver's license. Police say her
girth makes her a driving hazard.
   Regina Elizabeth Guy was asked to explain at a meeting set for
Friday why the Motor Vehicle Administration should not revoke her
license.
   The 25-year-old nursing assistant hired a lawyer and said Monday
this is a fight against discrimination against fat people
everywhere.
   ``Fat is not a four-letter word,'' she said. ``It's a
description. That's all.''
   Her troubles began in July when she was stopped while driving a
friend's car with expired registration tags. Last week she got a
letter from the MVA saying it was re-examining her driving
privilege. It asked her to attend the hearing.
   The letter quoted the patrol officer who stopped her as saying
her girth made it impossible for her to sit directly behind the
steering wheel.
   She ``had to operate her 1978 Pontiac station wagon from the
center of the front seat,'' the officer wrote. ``She was steering
with her left hand and was using her left foot to control the
pedals. I feel that this driver should have special equipment on
her car.''
   ``They say she is pushing a gas pedal with her left foot,''
attorney Christopher P. Brown said. ``If I would do that it is not
a crime. There is no issue of safety here. They are treating a fat
person differently.''
   Guy denied she was driving from the center of the front seat.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Fat Acceptance
plans a demonstration of support before the hearing.

   Celebrities led by rock 'n' roll singer Don Henley
have halted a condominium project on woodlands next to Walden Pond,
where Henry David Thoreau contemplated nature in solitude more than
a century ago.
   Henley, former member of the Eagles rock group, announced Monday
that the celebrities' Walden Woods Project and the non-profit Trust
for Public Land have made a $100,000 down payment on the 25-acre
parcel valued at $3.55 million.
   The land will remain unspoiled, and a new site for the 139-unit
housing project will be provided in nearby Concord.
   The settlement with housing officials and developers included
provisions to save another 25-acre parcel from becoming an office
and parking garage if a new site can be found.
   ``I think the word balance describes what we hope to achieve in
Walden Woods,'' Henley said.
   He is co-chairman of the Walden Woods Project, whose advisory
board includes actors Michael Douglas and Meryl Streep and Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. The Trust for Public Land works to
preserve land threatened by development.
   Henley, joined by singers Bonnie Raitt and Jimmy Buffett,
performed two concerts in April that raised $250,000 to preserve
the woods.
   ``It's easy to say no to a project,'' said Clark L. Ziegler, a
spokesman for the state Office of Communities and Development.
``But people who were opposed to it have taken on the
responsibility of finding an alternative solution. That's unusual.''
   Walden Pond is a 62-acre body of water on a state reservation
bordering Concord, an affluent town of 12,500 about 20 miles
northwest of Boston.
   Thoreau was a naturalist writer who lived in isolation by the
pond during the mid-1800s. He produced essays and other writings
from his solitude.
   The pond is far less pastoral than when he lived there in a
shack. It lies less than 100 yards from a highway and is adjacent
to a dump.
   Other celebrities who helped to save the woods include actors
Don Johnson, Ed Begley Jr. and Dana Delany. Also lending support
were author E.L. Doctorow and singers Arlo Guthrie, Aimee Mann,
John Hall and the band Boston.

   A French separatist has trounced a rival to win

Montreal.
   The victory in Monday's election makes Gilles Duceppe the first

group of independent lawmakers committed to Quebec sovereignty.
   Duceppe, 43, immediately declared that his victory was a message
to English Canada that Quebec is heading quickly toward a break
with the rest of the country.
   ``Quebec has understood that English Canada will never say yes
to Quebec demands,'' the labor negotiator told cheering supporters
at a victory party.
   He was propelled to victory by a surge in separatist sentiment
in Quebec after the death of the Meech Lake accord in June. The
proposed consitutional amendement, rejected by Manitoba and New
Brunswick provinces, would have given provinces special powers and
recognized Quebec as a ``distinct society'' within Canada.
   Gilles picked up about two-thirds of all votes cast in the
sububan Laurier-Ste-Marie district, trouncing his nearest rival,
Liberal Denis Coderre. New Democrat candidate Louise O`Neill was a
poor third and Conservative Christian Fortin finished fourth.
   In another special election, New Democrat Mike Breaugh handily
defeated his opponents in the Ontario district of Oshawa. Breaugh
had represented the district since December, when New Democrat
leader Ed Broadbent retired.

<HEAD>East German Farmers, Lumber Workers Protest in West Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German workers drove tractors, combines
and lumber trucks into West Berlin today, demanding help from East
and West German governments for their struggling farms and forest
industry.
   Farmers and lumber workers have been among the hardest hit by
the massive changes sweeping East Germany. They're seeking higher
wages and job security.
   Imported products from the West have cut demand for East German
items. Inefficiency is another bone of contention.
   ``We have such old machines, some of them made before the war,''
said 20-year-old Alexander Witt during the protest at the historic
Reichstag building.
   ``We're supposed to compete in a capitalist system, but it's
hard with such old machines that often break down and need repairs
and maintenance,'' he continued.
   Reflecting on the complexities that still pervade the East
German economy, Witt said he was not a ``farmer'' but rather an
``expert for plant production.'' His job: ``preparing the soil,
sowing and harvesting.''
   Witt, from Schoenefeld outside Berlin, was one of about 70
workers who had gathered by late morning in front of the Reichstag,
the massive building to become the parliament of a united Germany.
   The protesters drove there in more than 35 farm and forestry
vehicles, with dozens more expected by the afternoon.
   All wore rough work clothes, often flecked with dirt.
   Some took the opportunity to sell their products, which have
been unable to compete with Western goods flooding East Germany.
   ``If we don't sell, we can't keep working,'' shouted a burly
farm worker as he sold potatoes and peppers.
   The banner on the side of his truck read: ``We can't go on like
this.''
   East Germany's agricultural sector _ driven by four decades by
Communist governments before the inauguration of a non-Communist,
free-market administration this year _ is collapsing under the
weight of competition. About half of the farms are technically
bankrupt, economists say.
   That means hard times for the 800,000 farmers who till the
country's Soviet-style collectives. They face an uncertain feature
when the two Germanys merge later this year.
   Most of the workers taking part in today's protest said they
earned about $500 to $550 a month in base pay, adding they needed
overtime to survive.
   Forest workers are having similarly difficult times.
   ``The sawmills won't take our wood any more,'' said lumber truck
driver Edwin Braun. ``They take wood from Bavaria and the Soviet
Union, but not ours.''
   ``And our wood is still cheaper. It just doesn't make any
sense,'' said Braun, from the town of Neustrelitz about 60 miles
north of Berlin.
   Banners on the huge vehicles demanded support from the West
German and East German governments.
   One predicted a ``hot autumn'' if East Germany's agricultural
business continues its dangerous plunge.

<TEXT>
   For one American soldier, deployment in
Saudi Arabia is a honeymoon of sorts.
   The specialist, based at Fort Bragg, N.C., was scheduled to be
married on Aug. 11, but was called for duty in Saudi Arabia a few
days before then.
   ``My wife, then my fiancee, and I got to thinking that I might
not come back so, we decided to go ahead and do it,'' said the
specialist, among a contingent from the 82nd Airborne set up at a
Saudi air defense camp.
   The Saudi desert has the specialist from Monroeville, Ala.,
thinking about changing his honeymoon plans.
   ``We were supposed to go to Florida but now maybe we'll go
someplace better,'' he said. ``With this heat, maybe we'll go to
Alaska.''
   Ground rules for the Pentagon pool operation prohibit disclosure
of the exact location and publication of the names of American
troops deployed here to defend Saudi Arabia from a possible Iraqi
attack.
   The 82nd Airborne troops visited Tuesday are living in tents on
the Saudi complex, surrounded by M551-Sheridan airborne assault
vehicles, a light tank, antitank vehicles equipped with TOW
missiles and other weapons.
   When they arrived, their worries were potential battles with
Iraqi troops and possible use of chemical weapons against them.
Now, with Iraqi forces taking up defensive positions and the
burgeoning American force digging in as well, the troops here are
more worried about family back home and beating the intense desert
heat.
   Temperatures were approaching 100 degrees when the pool visited
the troops at 10 a.m. local time Tuesday and were expected to reach
115 degrees or higher by afternoon. The reddish sand of the desert
can be seen for miles; shade is almost impossible to find.
   The most popular spot here is the maintenance garage, which
offers a respite from the sun and _ by Saudi standards _ a cooling
breeze.
   All of the American forces here are told to drink at least six
gallons of water a day to avoid dehydration in the searing heat.
   These rapid-deployment forces were called into action so quickly
that many said they did not get to say goodbye to family and
friends.
   ``The last time I saw my wife was 5 a.m. the day I left,'' said
one staff sergeant. ``She wasn't home when I got the call to go. So
I got a quick note off before I left and wrote her from Spain on
the way over.''
   One of the few complaints from the soldiers is that they think
the U.S. government should provide them with a free mail system.
   ``I didn't have time to get any money,'' said the staff
sergeant, based at Fort Bragg and originally from New York.
   All of a dozen soldiers interviewed asked that reporters let
family and friends back home know they were safe.
   ``I hope the American people realize the need for us to be
here,'' one lieutenant said. ``As leaders of the free world we
cannot allow this type of aggression to take place. No one really
likes being here but we've got a job to do and we're eager to do
it.''
   A lieutenant interviewed atop a Sheridan tank said morale has
been ``outstanding'' and that troops are beginning to adjust to the
heat.
   ``We're settling in now,'' he said. ``We came in expecting
anything from going into a peacetime mission to total war. In
Panama we went in knowing it was a combat situation right off the
bat.''
   The troops left the states so quickly they could not bring any
gear for recreation activities. So now they mostly sit and wait.
Those assigned to day shifts say sleeping at night, when
temperatures drop into the 80s, isn't so bad. There are rows of
tents for those who need to sleep during the day, but they provide
little escape from the dry heat.
   ``We'd rather sit and wait than go and fight but it's
frustrating,'' said the lieutenant.
   The staff sergeant had a different perspective.
   ``If I have to come this far and go through all this trouble I'd
rather get out there and fight, take care of business,'' he said.
   Saudi forces brought the American troops sandwiches and fries
from a Hardees fast-food restaurant and also have brought
breakfasts of bread, fruit and cheeses. But several said they would
prefer to eat their Army-issued MREs _ meals ready to eat.
   ``No offense, because the Saudis have been great hosts, but
things just taste a little different,'' said one sergeant.
   All of the troops have chemical warfare suits with them and gas
masks strapped to their hips.
   ``You hear little rumors about it (the possibility of chemical
attacks) from time to time but you just press on,'' another
sergeant from Fort Bragg said as he stood next to a huge satellite
communications disk. ``We've got a lot of duties to take care of
here so you can't worry too much.''
   Said a sergeant from Mt. Airy, N.C.: ``You can't worry about the
gas or chemicals. You take in the equipment and if you need to use
it you do. We're trained and ready.''
   Gen. Ed Scholes, commander of the forward command forces here,
said ``our troops are prepared for that and ready for it if it
comes. ... You're always concerned about that prospect but our
troops here are trained in that and they have the equipment.''
   Scholes described the mission as ``deterrence, assisting and
training the Saudis and if necessary assisting them in the defense
of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.''
   Part of the 82nd's current work, he said, was securing an area
for the arrival of Marines and equipment.
   Scholes and the troops reported few equipment problems
associated with the heat.
   ``There are obvious problems in operating in this environment
but we've had nothing unusual,'' the general said.
   Some radio failures have been blamed on the heat.
   Army officials said last week that units with tanks and other
vehicles would need additional air filters and higher viscosity oil
to keep running in the desert environment. As much a problem as the
heat is the talcum-like sand of the desert.

   Former Swiss hostage Elio Erriquez headed
home today, his first full day of freedom after Palestinian
kidnappers in Lebanon released him to Syrian officials.
   ``I am happy, very, very happy,'' Erriquez said at the Foreign
Ministry minutes after his arrival in the Syrian capital. He was
then whisked away by Swiss Ambassador Eric Pfister.
   Erriquez, 24, later left for Geneva.
   He and another Swiss national, Emanuel Christen, were kidnapped
Oct. 6 near a clinic run by the International Committee of the Red
Cross where they worked in Sidon. Christen, 33, was released from
captivity a week ago.
   In Geneva, the relief organization's president, Cornelio
Sommaruga, today welcomed the release and made a ``pressing
appeal'' for the freeing of all other hostages.
   Swiss Foreign Minister Rene Felber joined the appeal. He said
Switzerland would make available its information and its diplomatic
cooperation to all countries which still had citizens held captive
in Lebanon.
   The kidnappers turned Erriquez over to Syrian officials in
Lebanon and Syria's state minister for foreign affairs, Nasser
Qaddour, passed him to Pfister later the same day.
   Erriquez, wearing a white shirt and white pants, looked pale but
in good health after his 10-month ordeal. He was taken to Pfister's
residence and there was no word on when he would leave Syria.
   In Geneva, his mother, Graziana Erriquez, spent agonizing hours
Monday before receiving official confirmation that her son was free.
   ``Waiting for the definite word was bad,'' she said. ``I had
been waiting all day long. But now, I am very happy.''
   In Beirut, a late-night communique from a group calling itself
the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads said Erriquez was released to
a representative of Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, chief of Syria's
military intelligence in Lebanon.
   The 30-word handwritten statement in Arabic was delivered to a
Western news agency in Beirut along with a black-and-white
photograph of the hostage. But it gave no details about when or
where he was released.
   The group said Erriquez, an orthopedic specialist, was freed
from 10 months in captivity at the behest of Syria, Libya and
Algeria.
   Erriquez and Christen were kidnapped by masked gunmen near a Red
Cross center in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Police had blamed the abduction on Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
a radical guerrilla group led by Palestinian terrorist mastermind
Abu Nidal. The group denied the accusation.
   In its statement, the Palestinian Revolutionary Squads denied
any connection to Abu Nidal or any other Palestinian faction.
   It paid ``particular tribute to Mustafa Saad for efficient role
to ensure a success'' of the release. Saad heads the leftist
Nasserite Popular Organization militia, which has controlled Sidon
since the outbreak of Lebanon's civil war in 1975.
   Erriquez's release left 14 Western hostages in Lebanon, most
held by underground Shiite Moslem extremists loyal to Iran.
   The captives are six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans,
an Irishman and an Italian. Longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative settlement has been reached in a
strike at a General Motors Corp. parts plant, but the walkout
highlighted the giant automaker's vulnerability to local labor
problems.
   The 2,800 United Auto Workers union members at the AC Rochester
West parts plant in Flint walked off their jobs Wednesday in what
was billed as a local dispute over health and safety and other
matters.
   By Monday, parts shortages created by the strike forced the
shutdown of four assembly plants and partial closings of four
component factories, idling about 11,500 employees.
   A tentative agreement was reached Monday afternoon and union
members were to vote on it this afternoon. Spokesman John Maciarz
said GM hoped the strikers would return to work by Wednesday making
fuel tanks and grilles for a variety of GM cars and trucks.
   But it will take longer for assembly plant workers to get back
to their jobs since the parts pipelines to those plants have been
dried up, Maciarz said.
   The rippling effect of the parts plant strike is a symptom of a
``just-in-time'' delivery system embraced by automakers. It calls
for parts to be delivered to assembly plants sometimes just hours
before they are needed on assembly lines.
   The strike came as the UAW was negotiating three-year contracts
with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. covering more than
450,000 workers. Current UAW agreements with the Big Three expire
Sept. 14.
   Labor experts said Monday that the strike may indicate that UAW
leaders want GM to be the company the union chooses to bargain with
first, to set the pattern for contracts at the other automakers.
   Dale Brickner of Michigan State University's School of Labor and
Industrial Relations said it was significant that the international
union didn't press the local at the parts plant not to strike in
order to avoid friction at the national negotiations.
   ``The important point is the fact that the international hasn't
clamped down, saying, `No, you can't do this because of
negotiations going on,''' Brickner said.
   By Monday afternoon, GM shut down truck assembly plants in
Moraine, Ohio; Shreveport, La.; and Pontiac; and a car plant in
Flint. Other car plants near Pontiac and in Wentzville, Mo.,
outside St. Louis were in danger of closure.
   About 1,000 other workers were laid off when production was cut
at component plants in Flint; Kokomo, Ind.; and Warren, Ohio.

   A second Iraqi ship was blocked from loading supplies at a
Persian Gulf port today as a U.S.-led economic quarantine on Iraq
intensified.
   Jordan, however, was reported keeping open a small Iraqi oil
pipeline.
   Meanwhile, a mine alert was posted for a central Persian Gulf
channel where an Iraqi ship was seen Monday, shipping sources said.
   President Bush cuts into his Maine vacation today to return to
Washington for talks on the gulf crisis and the budget deficit. He
will receive a Pentagon briefing on the military confrontation with
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
   Authorities in the United Arab Emirates stopped the Iraqi
freighter Al-Abid from entering the port of Dubai today, shipping
sources said.
   Radio monitors in the Persian Gulf overheard the Al-Abid calling
out every 10 minutes for permission to enter the harbor and load
supplies for transport to Iraq.
   Diplomatic sources in the United Arab Emirates said the
country's ports have quietly stopped allowing Iraqi tankers or
freighters entry, although the government has made no official
statements to that effect.
   Another Iraqi freighter, Al-Baya, has been waiting off Dubai for
the last two days, the shipping sources said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In other developments, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said
Bush asked Japan's Prime Minister Toshiko Kaifu for more Japanese
financial aid to Middle East nations affected by the crisis.
   U.S. combat troops arriving in Saudi Arabia have been told to
prepare for a long stay.
   U.S. navy ships maneuvered to block trade with Iraq. Bush said
the Navy would halt Iraqi tankers to ``stop the oil from coming
out.'' Britain and Australia also said they would help interdict
Iraqi ships.
   The Washington Post today quoted unidentified U.N. sources as
saying that at an informal, closed-door meeting of the Security
Council on Monday, the Soviet Union, France, Canada and Malaysia
``sharply criticized'' the U.S. decision to proceed unilaterally
with the naval quarantine of Iraq and Kuwait.
   A world embargo was placed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2 and announced it was annexing its small, oil-rich neighbor.
Iraq massed troops near Saudi Arabia, sending alarm bells off
throughout the Middle East. The Saudis have the world's largest oil
reserves.
   Shipping executives said they were told by U.S. Navy officials
that an Iraqi vessel was spotted dropping mines in the Shah Olam
shoals, 80 miles northeast of the Qatar Peninsula. The channel is
used by tankers heading for Saudi Arabian oil terminals.
   But another official said U.S. forces might have spotted mines
left over from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran mined the waterway during
the conflict, which ended in 1988.
   On Sunday, the Iraqi oil tanker al-Qaddisiyah was kept from
docking at the Saudi terminal at Yanbu on the Red Sea after tugs
failed to show up, Saudi diplomatic sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   That, in effect, meant that Iraq's last major oil export outlet,
a pipeline across the Arabian peninsula, was cut off. Turkey
earlier closed two pipelines carrying Iraqi oil.
   However, a small Iraqi oil pipeline and road transport between
Jordan and Iraq were reported operating normally Monday.
   Jordan's information minister, Ibrahim Izzeddine, said Jordan
intends to abide by the mandatory U.N. Security resolution imposing
sanctions on Iraq _ ``but it is still premature now to decide what
sanctions will be imposed.''
   Jordan's Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Mutasem Belbeisi said
today Amman intends to discuss the economic embargo against Iraq
with the United Nations.
   About 40 percent of Jordanian exports go to neighboring Iraq.
   Official sources at Jordan's Ministry of Commerce said the
pipeline continued to operate as usual Monday. AP photographer
Yousef Allan, at Jordan's border post of Ruweishid, 210 miles
northeast of Amman, said a truck or tanker crossed into Jordan
every three or four minutes.
   The pipeline terminates at a desert outpost known as H-4, where
tanker trucks load the petroleum and drive it to the Red Sea port
of Aqaba for export, with much of the oil kept for Jordanian
domestic use.
   Visiting Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., said Monday in Amman,
Jordan's capital, that there was little chance of forcing Saddam to
pull his forces from Kuwait without Jordanian sanctions.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the naval
barricade had forced two or three ships to turn back at sea, and
that ``the embargo is being maintained'' on shipping into and out
of Iraq. He said the main target of the embargo is to squeeze the
Iraqis so they cannot ``maintain their war machine.''
   Baghdad is heavily dependent on oil exports to buy food and
other supplies for its 17 million people. Saddam has asked Iraqis
to cut meat consumption by half and not to hoard food, warning that
black marketeers will be executed.
   The New York Times in today's editions reported Iraq transferred
$3 billion to $4 billion in confiscated gold bullion, currency and
goods from Kuwaiti institutions to Baghdad. The paper quoted Arab
bankers in London and the gulf. On Monday, Pakistan voted to send
troops to help defend Saudi Arabia, joining ground forces from the
United States, Egypt, Morocco and Syria .
   Warplanes and navy ships from several nations have gathered in
the region since the invasion.
   Today's Washington Post also quoted an unidentified Bush
administration official as saying Egyptian authorities could send
about 30,000 more troops, to supplement the 3,000 men dispatched to
Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Cheney will fly to Saudi
Arabia on Friday to visit U.S. troops and meet with the kingdom's
leaders. It will be Cheney's second trip to the gulf since Kuwait
was invaded.
   Maj. Gen. Don L. Kaufman, chief of the U.S. military training
mission to Saudi Arabia, said Monday that planes bearing U.S.
troops and equipment were landing every 10 minutes or so at a base
in the desert.
   ``I think our position grows stronger with each day that goes
by,'' he said.
   Saddam has called for a ``holy war'' against the Saudi royalty
and Western military forces now assembled in the region.
   Today, Iraq remained defiant despite the naval buildup.
   The state newspaper Al-Jumhuriya said Iraq knows how to answer
the Bush administration, ``how to foil its measures, penetrate its
blockade, makes its troops taste death if they attack us and move
the battlefield to where it (the United States) does not want or
expect it to be.''
   The paper was quoted by the Iraq News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler estimated that
about 2,500 Americans still are in Iraqi-held Kuwait plus the 500
to 600 in Iraq itself.

   A surrogate mother carrying a couple's
test-tube baby is suing for custody of the child in a case that
could re-define parenthood.
   ``There's nothing negotiable about it. This is my baby,''
declared Anna Johnson, a 29-year-old who filed suit in state court
Monday for custody of the child on grounds that the biological
parents would not provide a good home.
   Mark and Crispina Calvert gave the sperm and egg to create the
embryo that was transferred from a lab dish to Johnson's womb under
a $10,000 agreement with the woman, a single parent of a
3-year-old. The baby is due in two months.
   Johnson's effort to pursue custody of a baby that has no
biological relation to her is unprecedented, said the Calverts'
attorney, Christian Van Deusen.
   The case differs from the landmark Baby M custody case in New
Jersey. In that case, the child was conceived with a surrogate
mother's egg and the sperm of a man hiring her. The man's wife had
no biological ties to the child.
   Van Deusen and an attorney for Ms. Johnson, Richard C. Gilbert,
said the Johnson case will focus on what constitutes parenthood.
Although California law presumes the birth mother is the legal
parent, a judge has leeway, Gilbert said.
   Johnson, appearing today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
maintained she had biological and maternal bonds with the fetus.
She said that ``the baby, while it's growing inside me, has my
cells and my blood nurturing this child, maintaining its life.''
   The Calverts' lawyer conceded Johnson was nurturing the unborn
child. ``But I don't believe it puts her in a position of holding
this child hostage,'' Van Deusen said this morning.
   Johnson, who is on disability because of pregnancy
complications, also seeks child support and damages for emotional
distress.
   She said she decided to seek custody because she believes the
Calverts showed disregard for her complications and gave the
impression they might not want the baby.
   The Calverts denied Johnson's allegations that they ignored her
medical needs, failed to make timely payments or lost interest in
the pregnancy.
   Johnson and Mrs. Calvert worked as nurses at the same Santa Ana
hospital.
   ``I was surprised that she did this to us,'' a tearful Mrs.
Calvert said. ``We thought that we had a good relationship after
all I've done for her.''
   Mrs. Calvert, who is unable to carry a child because of a
hysterectomy, said, ``I just cry. I don't know what to do. We're
really looking forward to this baby.''
   Johnson also denied that she was seeking custody for monetary
gain or because she craved publicity, as the couple suggested. She
said she had seen the surrogate contract as a way to put herself
through graduate nursing school.
   ``The problem is not money. The problem is fetal neglect. And
they will have to address that in court,'' said Gilbert.

<HEAD>About 19,000 Muscovites Quit Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 19,000 Muscovites quit the Communist Party
in July following a watershed party congress, Politburo member Yuri
Prokofiev said today.
   The 19,000 were in addition to the 27,000 people who quit during
the first six months of this year, he said.
   Prokofiev, the Moscow Communist Party chief, said half the
people turning in their membership cards were workers and the rest
were either intellectuals or pensioners.
   He told the official Tass news agency that 7,000 people have
joined the Moscow wing of the party so far this year, nearly half
of them under 35 years old.
   Prokofiev said the majority of those leaving had joined the
party to promote their careers. But since taking office in 1985,
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has moved to separate the
government from party jobs and business. The Communist Party has
during that time lost much prestige, and been stripped of its
constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society.
   Prokofiev said Communists now must find a new role for the party
in dealing with social and economic problems. He said they must
find common ground with orthodox Communists as well as Democratic
Platform, the reform group which had been working within the party
but now plans to form a separate party.
   The party's national personnel chief said earlier this month
that 370,000 people had followed Russian Federation President Boris
Yeltsin and other prominent reformers in quitting the party so far
this year.
   Yeltsin announced his resignation during the 28th Communist
Party congress, which ended in Moscow on Juy 13.
   Boris Pugo, chairman of the party's Central Control Committee,
said another 125,000 members were expelled, 120,000 died and
150,000 stopped paying their membership dues or participating in
party activities.
   The Communist Party has more than 18 million members.

<TEXT>
   Former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega paid
his first visit to the United States since his election defeat last
February and admitted he made many mistakes while in power.
   ``I'd say the expectations that we created that we could solve
all our country's problems was one of my biggest mistakes,'' he
said. ``But we didn't have the resources to respond to all those
problems.''
   About 2,500 people gathered for Ortega's speech Monday at
Riverside Church, an interdenominational, landmark church known for
its support of liberal causes.
   The crowd was at times exuberant, often interrupting Ortega with
applause and shouts of ``Viva Nica!''
   Ortega, who spoke in Spanish and had a translator at his side,
said the fact that democratic elections were held was more
important than his loss to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her
pro-U.S. United National Opposition alliance Feb. 25.
   She took office April 25, but her term has been beset by
disputes within her alliance, high inflation resulting from a
lifting of price controls, and Sandinista-led strikes.
   In his 90-minute speech, Ortega repeatedly called for stability
in his homeland, something he said the Sandinistas have been
fighting for since 1979, when they came into power after
overthrowing the 45-year dictatorship of the Somoza family.
   ``This is the revolutionary project that didn't disappear with
the elections,'' he said.
   Ortega also criticized U.S. foreign policy and urged autonomy
for Puerto Rico.
   In a question-and-answer period, Ortega said, ``the United
States must stop occupying Puerto Rico and stop occupying
Guantanamo Bay,'' a U.S. military base on Cuba.
   Ortega, dressed in a dark pinstripe suit, did not mention his
political plans.
   David Wilson, 23, a New Yorker who is a member of the Nicaragua
Solidarity Network, said the turnout for Ortega's visit showed that
support still existed for the former leader and his party.
   ``I think it's more important to support a party out of power
with less access to all kinds of channels within the media and
international forums than it is to support a party in power,'' he
said.
   Ortega arrived in New York on Monday.

   A car bomb exploded in front of an army
barracks, killing one man and injuring at least 19 others.
Authorities said they suspected Shining Path rebels were behind the
attack.
   The blast occurred Monday afternoon in the heart of downtown
Cusco, a block from a fashionable tourist hotel. Police said a
40-year-old Mexican woman and her 12-year-old daughter were injured
in the explosion. Five soldiers, one officer and four enlisted men
also were hurt.
   Cusco is in the Peruvian highlands, 350 miles southeast of Lima,
and is one of Latin America's leading tourist centers. The city has
been relatively free of political violence in recent years.
   Authorities said they suspected the Shining Path, a Maoist rebel
group that has fought the government since 1980. More than 18,000
people have died in political violence in Peru in the past decade.
   In Lima, meanhwile, suspected terrorists tossed a hand grenade
at a police car Monday evening, killing one officer and seriously
wounding another. The attack took place outside a food market on
the city's east side.
   In other political violence, five people were reported killed in
two different regions of the Peruvian highlands over the past few
days.

   An environmental group said it would not
oppose plans to conduct the first field test of a genetically
engineered vaccine on wildlife in the United States.
   The Virginia Department of Health announced Monday that a 10-day
test of a rabies vaccine will begin Aug. 20. It will be tested on
Parramore Island, an uninhabited barrier island about 4{ miles off
the coast of Virginia.
   The National Wildlife Federation, which had initially fought
plans to conduct tests because of safety concerns, will not object
to the field test, according to Margaret Mellon, a molecular
biologist and lawyer for the group.
   The tests will be done by the Wistar Institute of Philadelphia,
which began work on the vaccine in 1982. Wistar is a non-profit,
independent biomedical research center.
   Ms. Mellon said the group was ``appalled'' by the way U.S.
Department of Agriculture officials were so quick to support
Wistar's plans, but said refinements in the plans made the
federation ``more comfortable'' with the project.
   The USDA, the state of Virginia and the Nature Conservancy, a
non-profit organization that owns the seven-mile long island,
approved the field test. The conservancy consented to the project
Monday after coming to an agreement with Wistar over several
concerns, including legal responsibility.
   ``We realized that this island was really one of the few, if not
only, places the test could be done,'' said a conservancy
spokeswoman, Holley Darden.
   The vaccine was developed to combat the problem of rabid
raccoons, which have reached epidemic levels in the Mid-Atlantic
states in recent years, said Dr. Warren Cheston, Wistar's associate
director.
   So far this year, 127 rabies cases have been reported in
Virginia, while Pennsylvania has documented 376 cases, according to
state health authorities.
   During the field test, scientists will scatter bait laden with
the vaccine over the island. Researchers will then spend the next
year tracking the animals and testing their blood to see if they
have developed antibodies to the rabies virus.
   Ms. Darden said the island's raccoon population, which numbers
about 400, has not been previously exposed to rabies. She said the
Wistar Institute would follow guidelines to prevent island animals
from escaping to the mainland.
   The island will be off-limits to the public and monitored by the
Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries.
   The vaccine could be commercially available in as few as five
years if the trial goes well and further tests are also successful,
according to Dr. David Espeseth of the USDA.
   Scientists developed the vaccine by inserting a gene from the
rabies virus into the live vaccinia virus, an organism used to
develop vaccines against smallpox and other diseases. The vaccine
cannot spread the disease because it does not use the parts of the
virus that cause rabies, according to Cheston.
   More than 40 species of laboratory animals injected with the
altered virus have shown immunity to rabies, he said.

   About 10,000 student radicals chanting
``Free travel, total border opening!'' rallied today to demand
unrestricted travel to North Korea.
   Some students at Seoul's Yonsei University, a focal point of
many disturbances, slashed rolls of barbed wire with wire cutters
to symbolize the breaking of barriers between the bitterly divided
Koreas.
   Earlier today, 79 students and dissidents were arrested at the
sprawling U.S. 8th Army headquarters in central Seoul, five of them
for ramming a car through the main gate.
   The car, carrying dissidents and a radical student shouting
``Drive out Yankees!'' barged through the main gate, but was
surrounded by almost 50 riot police about 30 yards inside the
facility. Police arrested the five occupants. There were no
injuries.
   Student leaders said thousands of people were expected to march
to the border Wednesday to attend a unification rally at the truce
village of Panmunjom. Students at the rally were chanting ``Let's
go North!''
   The students also chanted ``Let's drive out the Yankees who
block unification of the fatherland.'' They were demanding the
withdrawal of some 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea
claiming their presence hinders dialogue with the North on the
unification of the Korean peninisula.
   Dissident Roman Catholic priests and radical students staged
protests demanding unification of North and South Korea at Freedom
Bridge, a major access checkpoint to the border.
   ``Withdraw U.S. troops which heighten tension and block
unification,'' read a large banner at the border.
   Dozens of radical students shouting ``Unification!'' tried to
ram their way through guards at the bridge, but were hauled away by
riot police.
   In Seoul, the government's Unification Ministry charged North
Korea with blocking the first-ever proposed travel between citizens
of the divided Koreas and urged Communist North Korea to open its
borders.
   North Korea, in broadcasts monitored in Tokyo, made similar
accusations against the South and accused Seoul of being
``deceitful.''
   Under a South Korean proposal, the heavily armed border was to
have opened for unrestricted travel to North Korea for five days,
beginning Monday. But both sides failed to agree on procedures.
   More than 61,000 South Koreans applied to visit the North during
the trial border opening.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of
their land in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early
1950s. Their border is sealed and there is no mail or other forms
of regular communication.
   ``Let's advance unification of the fatherland!'' shouted South
Korean radical students at Freedom Bridge, on the edge of the
Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.
   When 37 students tried to forcibly ram through a 10-foot metal
and wire gate onto the bridge, they were arrested and hauled away
by riot police.
   Hundreds of riot police have been stationed at Freedom Bridge,
35 miles north of Seoul, to prevent violence during the failed
border opening.
   The two Koreas have accusing the other of using the border
opening as propaganda. Both sides have rejected meetings proposed
by the other.

<TEXT>
   The Voice of America is cautioning Americans
trapped in Kuwait not to try to flee across the border into Saudi
Arabia, the State Department said today.
   About 500 Americans already have been able to sneak into Saudi
Arabia, penetrating lax Iraqi security, but a caravan of others who
tried to flee were forced to beat a sweltering retreat.
   The clandestine departures reduce the number of civilian
Americans in Kuwait to 2,500, according to State Department
figures. Also stranded are 500 to 600 Americans in Iraq.
   The Voice of America, a radio service operated by the U.S.
government, is urging the Americans still in Kuwait not to try to
cross the border ``due to the danger involved,'' but advising them
to get ready to leave on short notice.
   ``When the orderly evacuation of Americans wishing to leave
Kuwait becomes possible, American citizens will be contacted by
phone or by radio and information will be broadcast by the Voice of
America and the BBC,'' VOA broadcasts said.
   The Iraqi ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat,
said today that the Americans will be freed in ``due time.''
   ``We have already let many people go,'' Al-Mashat said on NBC's
``Today.'' ``It takes time and under current circumstances, in due
time they are going to be let free.''
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was scheduled
to meet today with officials of the deposed Kuwaiti regime to
discuss the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly had high-level contacts
on Monday with Syrian authorities. The gulf crisis has brought
Syria closer to the United States because of Syria's longstanding
rivalry with Iraq.
   As the Iraqi conquest of Kuwait entered its 13th day today, the
fate of the Americans continued to be a matter of utmost concern to
the Bush administration.
   U.S. diplomats have been in constant contact with Iraqi
authorities about the issue, but the Iraqis have given no
indication that the Americans will be allowed to leave. Exempted
from this policy are Americans attached to the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad, 10 of whom left for home on Saturday. More are scheduled
to leave later this week.
   The stranded Americans have been caught up in the war of nerves
between the United States and Iraq. Although they still are not
being called hostages, U.S. officials suspect that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein may try to use the Americans as blackmail if his
confrontation with the United States worsens.
   U.S. officials said the Americans who managed to flee Kuwait
took advantage of lax Iraqi security at the final checkpoint on
Kuwaiti territory and entered the relative safety of Saudi Arabia.
   But a Briton, David Thomas Croskery, who apparently tried to
flee by the same route was shot to death on Saturday by Iraqi
troops in Kuwait. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the administration was ``shocked and extremely concerned'' by
the incident.
   She said there were rumors Sunday that all foreigners were being
allowed to leave, but the administration was told that only
Africans, South Asians and Latins are being given such permission.
Iraqi broadcasts indicate that Arabs and East Asians also have been
allowed to depart.
   False news reports about the opening of the Kuwait-Saudi border
to all foreigners prompted 40 to 50 carloads of Americans to head
for the frontier, Ms. Tutwiler said. They were turned back at the
border, their disappointment aggravated by blistering heat, she
said.
   The attempted exodus may have been the result of an Iraqi
broadcast on Sunday saying the authorities have been instructed to
``facilitate the travel of the Arabs and foreign residents in
Kuwait and other cities of southern Iraq.'' Southern Iraq is the
term Iraqis have used to describe what was once Kuwait.

   Lawyer Thomas Root's legal troubles
have mounted since his bizarre flight down the East Coast last year
that ended in his dramatic rescue when his plane crashed off the
Bahamas.
   Monday, he was among four men charged in connection with the
allegedly fraudulent selling of investments in would-be Christian
FM radio stations.
   Root, a former communications lawyer from Alexandria, Va.,
already faces up to 35 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines
after pleading guilty to federal felony charges of misrepresenting
clients.
   In addition, he was indicted in June by a grand jury in North
Carolina on 455 counts of securities fraud and other charges.
   The latest charges were detailed by a 50-count indictment
returned by a state grand jury and unsealed Monday. It charges Root
and three executives of Sonrise Management Services with
racketeering, securities fraud, organized fraud, sale of
unregistered securities and grand theft.
   The defendants are accused of selling fraudulent investment
opportunities in FM radio license applications pending before the
Federal Communications Commission in Washington.
   Root has denied that financial and legal troubles were connected
with the mysterious six-hour flight that brought him to national
attention in July 1989.
   He said he blacked out and the Cessna 210 continued on autopilot
until it hit the Atlantic Ocean off the Bahamas. But Navy fighter
pilots who intercepted the flight said they saw Root moving in the
cockpit.
   Divers who rescued Root discovered he had a gunshot wound in his
stomach. Root says he does not know how he got shot.
   Root's attorney, Eugene Propper, said his client will turn
himself in to authorities in Clearwater, but declined to say when.
Bond for Root is set at $150,000.
   Propper said he has not seen the indictment and declined to
comment further.
   Root, 37, handled applications for investors of Sonrise, a
Columbus, Ga.-based company that touted Christian principles in
literature carried by sales representatives in Georgia, Alabama,
North Carolina, California and Florida.
   Prosecutors said more than 200 Florida investors put more than
$1.3 million into the schemes, and that the defendants took in more
than $40 million in 1986-89 from more than 3,000 people nationwide.
   Also named in the Florida indictment were Ralph M. Savage, 54,
of Phenix City, Ala.; Eugene B. White, 43, of Columbus, Ga.; and
Carl W. Hurlebaus, 31, of Landover, Md. In 1988, Savage and White
claimed net worth of at least $9 million each, prosecutors said.

<HEAD>U.S. Criticized For Moving Too Fast In Policing Quarantine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several Security Council members have
criticized the United States for moving too fast, too forcefully
and without council approval to cut off Iraqi shipping.
   The criticism of the United States was delivered Monday in
closed council consultations on the Persian Gulf crisis, U.N. and
Western diplomats said.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar did not criticize the
U.S. quarantine, but said Monday that only the Security Council
could legally enforce an embargo.
   ``I have nothing to say against it (the U.S. quarantine and
military presence) provided there is consent from other parties,''
Perez de Cuellar told reporters.
   He said all states were free to act under the U.N. Charter,
which supports ``the inherent right of individual or collective
self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the
United Nations.''
   But he added that: ``Only the United Nations, through its
Security Council resolutions, can really decide about a blockade.''
   Iraqi Ambassador Amir Al-Anbari later told the secretary-general
that his government has no intention of invading Saudi Arabia, that
the U.S. military buildup is unjustified and that the United States
and its allies are creating pretexts for aggression against Iraq.
   U.S. and U.N. officials said there was no contradiction between
the U.N. embargo resolution and the U.S. cut off of Iraqi shipping.
Both bar import to Iraq of all grain and foodstuffs, except in
cases of dire need and humanitarian concern.
   In the 15-member council Monday, Cuba and other nations
criticized the U.S. decision to use force to police the trade
embargo against Iraq. The embargo was ordered by the Security
Council after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Cuba said the United States should not consider itself the world
policeman and should have waited for the Security Council to decide
that further action was necessary.
   The Washington Post said today that France, Canada, the Soviet
Union and Malaysia strongly criticized the U.S. position in the
council meeting.
   Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon told reporters later that:
``The United States does not have the right to interpret Security
Council resolutions and act without council permission. It is
undermining the role of the council.''
   He said he ``did not remember any country who supported the U.S.
stand'' in the council Monday.
   ``The United States cannot arrogate to itself the policeman's
role which has not been first decided by the council,'' he said.
   A Security Council committee is to meet Friday and evaluate
compliance with the embargo, based on reports from many of the 159
member states. It then will make recommendations on the enforcement
of the embargo.
   Under the U.N. Charter, Article 42 of Chapter 7, the Security
Council can call for an international military blockade to enforce
its resolutions.
   The United States has said that Kuwait requested the U.S. action
to enforce the quarantine against Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Led by impeached Gov. Evan Mecham, opponents of a
paid state holiday commemorating assassinated civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. filed petitions to let the voters decide the
issue.
   If 43,350 signatures submitted Monday are validated by spot
checks, the holiday's fate will be determined during the November
general election.
   Mecham and his supporters say an unpaid King holiday already
exists. They say the real issue is whether voters want to give
state employees another paid day off, not whether they want to
honor the slain civil rights activist.
   Mecham, one of five Republicans running for governor this year,
led a group that filed 71,000 signatures.
   Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, speaking for a coalition of business
and civic leaders, said the holiday is needed ``to honor the
remarkable progress America has made in race relations.''
   The cost of the holiday has been estimated at $500,000 to $4
million a year. But some civic leaders say they'd rather pay for
the holiday than suffer bad publicity over Arizona's lack of a paid
holiday.
   Mecham's successor, Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, urged voters
to approve the paid holiday.
   The holiday has been a sore point in Arizona since 1986, when
Babbitt bypassed the Legislature and issued an executive
proclamation establishing a paid King holiday for executive-branch
employees.
   Republican Attorney General Bob Corbin issued an opinion saying
Babbitt's action was illegal. Mecham, who took office in 1987,
rescinded the paid holiday before it could take effect.
   He later established an unpaid ``Martin Luther King-Civil Rights
Day'' on the third Sunday in January. That proclamation has never
been repealed, but supporters of the paid King Day called it a
second-class honor and refused to recognize it.
   The Legislature decided last year to swap state workers' paid
Columbus Day holiday for a King Day, an action that already has
been made subject to approval on this November's ballot. The Mecham
drive would put a second referendum on the ballot to approve or
reject a 1990 law that restored Columbus Day in addition to King
Day.
   If voters approved both laws, the one with the most affirmative
votes would prevail. If they rejected both, the state would revert
to a paid day for Columbus and no paid day for King.

   Curtis Mayfield, a rhythm and blues musician
popular in the 1960s and '70s, was critically injured when a
lighting tower blown over by a gust of wind fell on his head before
a concert, authorities said.
   Mayfield, 48, was listed in critical but stable condition this
morning at Kings County Hospital, suffering from head and neck
injuries.
   Mayfield was scheduled to perform Monday night at the outdoor
Martin Luther King Concert Series in Brooklyn. With rain
threatening, the lighting tower and some speakers were blown over,
concert officials and police said.
   Three stagehands and four concert volunteers also were injured,
police spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Wrensen said. One other person was
hospitalized with an unspecified injury, Wrensen said. None of the
other injuries was serious.
   The Chicago-born musician was a teen-ager when he rose to
prominence as the guitarist, songwriter and occasional lead singer
for The Impressions. His hits with the Impressions included the
civil rights song ``People Get Ready.''
   He left the group in 1970 and two years later wrote the music
for the film ``Superfly,'' including the song ``Freddie's Dead.''
He also wrote the soundtrack for the 1975 Bill Cosby-Sidney Poitier
film ``Let's Do It Again.''

   A strong earthquake shook northeastern
Taiwan today but there were no immediate reports of casualties or
damage, authorities reported.
   The Central Weather Bureau said the quake registered a
preliminary reading of 6 on the open-ended Richter scale.
   Its epicenter was located at sea about 29 miles southeast of
Ilan on Taiwan's northeastern coast.
   The tremor was felt in Taipei.
   The Richter scale measure ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a 10-fold increase
in intensity.
   An earthquake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a
populated area.

   The city's chief accounting officer says
Philadelphia will be broke in nine months, despite plans to borrow
heavily this summer.
   ``There is an estimation that we'll run out of cash as a city,
even with all the loans being purchased from outside investors, in
May,'' Controller Jonathan A. Saidel said Monday.
   Saidel, quoted on KYW-AM, said he was told this by the mayor,
treasurer and finance director, who have recently refused to
discuss the city's finances.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode and Finance Director Betsy Reveal had said
that without new local taxes and more state money, the city might
be unable to pay its bills within 18 months.
   As in past summers, the city is preparing to borrow millions of
dollars. Reveal said Monday night the amount this year could be as
much as $450 million, about $150 million more than expected.
   Last year, the city borrowed $220 million and in June, city
officials said they would need $280 million to $300 million this
year. The city's budget year runs from July 1 to June 30.
   Reveal said the administration is preparing an ``offering
document'' detailing the city's finances for potential investors.
Until the document is released Thursday or Friday, Reveal said, it
would be improper for her to make public specific figures.
   The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Saturday that Standard &amp;
Poor's says the city had a larger deficit last fiscal year than the
$60.8 million officials had projected. The company in June reduced
its rating of Philadelphia's bonds to the lowest level recommended
to investors, and the lowest level of any major U.S. city.

<HEAD>Nine Blacks Killed In Rioting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least nine blacks were
killed today in fighting east of Johannesburg between residents of
a workers' hostel and squatters.
   Police Col. Gerrit Erasmus confirmed the deaths in Thokoza
township. He said it was unclear how many people were injured.
   Police Lt. Nina Barkhuizen said the fighting was between hostel
dwellers of the Zulu and Xhosa tribes. Ms. Barkhuizen said police
used teargas and birdshot to quell the fighting.
   The independent South African Associated Press said the fighting
broke out early in the morning when squatters from the Phola Park
camp attacked the Khalanyoni workers' hostel. The squatters
apparently attacked to avenge the slaying of one of their friends
on Sunday.
   ``A group of armed men wearing blankets entered the Khalanyoni
Hostel grounds and started attacking everyone in sight,'' hostel
dweller Mpumuzt Tshabalala told the South African Press Association.
   ``We ran helter skelter and those in their rooms had to jump
through windows to evade the attackers,'' Tshabalala said. He said
he narrowly escaped death when his room was firebombed.
   An unconfirmed report in the Star newspaper said the fighting
was between supporters of the African National Congress and the
conservative Zulu-based Inkatha organisation.
   A CBS TV staffer in the township said a group of about 600 armed
blacks, believed to be Inkatha supporters, marching after the
rioting through the township followed by police. They were armed
with weapons including iron rods and assegais - a traditional Zulu
spear and some held shields.
   Phola Park residents' committee chairman Prince Mhlambi appealed
for police neutrality. He said during the rioting two people were
killed in the presence of police. Some blacks have accused the
police of favoring Inkatha supporters.
   At least 33 people have died in clashes between rival black
groups in townships around Johannesburg in recent weeks.
   More than 5,000 blacks have died since 1986 in fighting between
Inkatha and ANC supporters in the eastern province of Natal.
   Fears that the conflict may be spreading to other parts of the
country were sparked in recent weeks after fighting involving
Inkatha and opposing groups erupted in areas around Johannesburg.

<TEXT>
   A weakening Tropical Storm Fran moved across the
island nation of Trinidad and Tobago today with maximum sustained
winds of 40 mph.
   The season's seventh tropical depression was heading west at
nearly 25 mph, said the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables.
   Fran was expected to dump up to 3 inches of rain on Trinidad,
whose government is recovering from an unsuccessful coup attempt
two weeks ago by radical Moslems.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Fran was centered over Trinidad. The island is
seven miles off Venezuela.
   The government of Trinidad and Tobago today issued a tropical
storm watch in place of a more urgent warning that had been posted
late Monday. A tropical storm watch was discontinued for Barbados,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines at 9 a.m.
   The storm had dissipated Sunday but regained strength Monday.
Forecasters said it was likely to degenerate into a tropical wave
as it entered the southeastern Caribbean.
   A tropical depression becomes a tropical storm once its top
sustained winds reach 39 mph. A hurricane has top winds of no less
than 74 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has barred the government from
enforcing a law sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms to keep children from
using dial-a-porn services.
   The Federal Communications Commission regulation said telephone
companies could not bill for calls containing ``indecent speech''
unless a customer certified in writing that he or she was 18 or
older and wanted the services.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson ruled Monday that the
law would probably infringe on the rights of free speech and due
process. The ruling applies only to New York but may influence
judges in other jurisdictions.
   The regulations were to have gone into effect Wednesday.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit by five companies that operate
telephone services in the New York area with sexually explicit
content. They sued to void the so-called Helms Amendment, named
after the North Carolina Republican.
   Joel R. Dichter, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the 1986
amendment ``would put these companies out of business.''
   He said that the requirement for a written request would have a
``chilling effect'' on the First Amendment because most people
would want to keep their anonymity when using the phone-sex
services.
   In issuing the injunction, the judge said the amendment probably
violated the First Amendment because it did not employ the least
restrictive means to accomplish its goal _ preventing children from
calling phone-sex services.
   The companies had argued voluntary blocking systems used by
several states such as New York were effective and less restrictive
than the FCC regulations.
   In New York, a household can have its access to sexually
explicit telephone services blocked free of charge by contacting
the telephone company. Most of the phone-sex numbers have a 900
area code, and 976 or 970 prefixes locally.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Kilson, who represents the
government, said a decision had not been made on whether to appeal.

<HEAD>20 Years Later, Art Institute Officially `Loses' O'Keeffe Painting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Georgia O'Keeffe painting has been formally
declared ``lost'' by the Art Institute of Chicago, 20 years after a
search for the misplaced painting began.
   Officials of the prestigious museum had continued to hope over
two decades that the work, ``East River from the Shelton,'' would
turn up, Art Institute director James Woods said Tuesday.
   But after a recent inventory of 1,500 pieces in the museum's
department of 20th century paintings and sculpture, Wood said
officials acknowledged the painting was nowhere to be found.
   ``Frankly, the reclassification of the painting as lost from the
museum is long overdue,'' Woods said. ``The painting has been
missing for 20 years. We are acknowledging that unfortunate fact
now.''
   Museum officials stopped short of saying the work, valued at
between $250,000 and $500,000, was stolen. But they have notified
the FBI, Interpol and other officials that it is missing.
   ``One has heard of objects being lost in museums or even going
out with the trash,'' Wood said. ``So it still might be found here
or in the hands of an innocent person.''
   The 1926 painting, on a 12-by-32-inch canvas, depicts the view
from a Manhattan hotel in which O'Keeffe and her husband,
photographer Alfred Stieglitz, lived.
   Stieglitz's estate loaned the work to the Art Institute in 1949
and it entered the museum's permanent collection as a gift from the
artist in 1955.
   O'Keeffe, acknowledged to be on of the foremost 20th century
American artists, died in 1986. She is best known for her paintings
of large-scale flowers and semi-abstract paintings reflecting the
influence of years she spent in the American Southwest.

<TEXT>
   A union is asking its members to approve a
contract that would end a 24-day strike involving 5,400 workers at
five Portland-area grocery chains and some independent markets.
   The tentative agreement was reached Monday on a four-year
contract for members of Local 555 of the United Food &amp; Commercial
Workers, who struck July 21. Details were not disclosed pending a
ratification meeting Wednesday.
   Rick Sawyer, a union spokesman, credited federal mediator Tom
Drew with putting together the deal.
   Sawyer said the grocers made a new offer including a
company-paid health benefits package because of the economic impact
of the walkout.
   A spokesman for the grocers said the settlement occurred because
shoppers crossed picket lines.
   Stephen Erdmann, executive director of Food Employers Inc., said
the strike had no winners. Full-time employees lost $1,400 in wages
and up to two months of health and welfare eligibility while
grocers lost sales and will have to pass along costs of the new
contract to consumers, he said.

<HEAD>Army's Order for Desert-Bound Troops: 5,500 Bottles of Suntan
Lotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HINESVILLE, Ga (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army went on a shopping spree at the
Hinesville K mart last week and got a blue-light special on more
than 24,000 items.
   K mart manager Wesley Bennefield said officials at Fort Stewart,
which began sending troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia over the
weekend, telephoned him Friday to order items essential for the
desert: 2,400 cans of bug spray, 5,550 bottles of skin lotion,
5,550 tubes of lip balm, 5,550 containers of foot powder and 5,550
bottle of suntan lotion.
   ``This has been a real treat. I've spent three days on the
telephone,'' said Bennefield, who had most of the items shipped to
the base Sunday night from K mart's Atlanta warehouse.
   The Army also ordered an item the local K mart doesn't carry:
174,000 gallons of bottled water. Bennefield said he had rounded up
84,000 gallons from bottled water companies as of this morning and
was trying to find the rest.
   Fort Stewart's public affairs officer, Maj. Don Keeling, said it
isn't unusual for the Army to go to local stores for such items.
   ``We have been going to various vendors to obtain whatever we
think is necessary for the protection of the welfare of our
soldiers,'' Keeling said.
   K mart gave the Army a discount on the order, but Bennefield
said he hasn't calculated the total cost yet. He said his store is
not making a profit off the deal.
   ``You might say we're waving the flag,'' he said. ``I'm a
patriotic guy.''

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein's government is now
calling Kuwait City one of the ``cities of southern Iraq'' after
annexing the oil-rich emirate.
   Baghdad at first installed a ``provisional government of free
Kuwait,'' which in turn declared a ``republic'' just 24 hours
before Iraq's Aug. 2 annexation.
   Under the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, it was known as
the State of Kuwait and bridled at being called an ``emirate,''
because in Arabic that term connotes a tiny sheikdom or fiefdom.
   Iraqi spokesmen are now referring to ``Kuwait, al-Jahra ... and
other cities of southern Iraq.'' Al-Jahra is one of the
municipalities that made up the State of Kuwait.

   Authorities in United Arab Emirates
stopped an Iraqi freighter from entering the port of Dubai today,
and shipping sources said a mine alert for a central Persian Gulf
channel was canceled.
   Radio monitors in the gulf overheard the Iraqi freighter Al-Abid
calling out every 10 minutes to authorities in the bustling
southern port of Dubai for permission to enter the harbor.
   The vessel was anchored three miles northwest of the Dubai
breakwater, they said.
   But the port control officials were overheard replying ``We've
no instructions, we've no instructions'' to give the ship
permission to enter.
   The shipping sources said Al-Abid also repeatedly requested
contact with its agent to help bring provisions for the crew, but
there was no indication the port authority would cooperate.
   Diplomatic sources in the United Arab Emirates said the
country's ports have quietly stopped allowing Iraqi tankers or
freighters entry. The government, however, has made no official
statements to this effect.
   Another Iraqi freighter, Al-Baya, has been waiting off Dubai for
the last two days to enter Dubai, the shipping sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   On the other side of the Arabian Peninsula, the Iraqi tanker
al-Qadissiyah was still anchored off the Red Sea terminal of Yanbu
today. It was turned away by Saudi authorities Sunday when it tried
to load oil from the trans-Saudi Iraqi pipeline.
   Meanwhile, a U.S. military source said that a mine alert in the
central gulf has been canceled.
   Shipping executives said they were told by U.S. Navy officials
that an Iraqi vessel was spotted dropping mines in the Shah Allum
shoals, 80 miles northeast of the Qatar Peninsula. The channel is
used by tankers heading for Saudi Arabian oil terminals.
   A U.S. military source in Dubai said a helicopter crew spotted a
merchant ship Saturday near Shah Allum, but on closer investigation
found it was not laying mines.
   ``The notice has since been rescinded and as of now there is no
specific concern about mines in the Gulf,'' the source said, on
condition of anonymity.
   The channel was the site where the USS Samuel B. Roberts hit a
mine in April 1988. The frigate, escorting a U.S.-reflagged Kuwaiti
tanker, struck Iranian-sowed mines and 10 American sailors were
injured in a massive explosion.
   Kuwait was then the primary target of Iranian attacks on
shipping in the vital waterway because it was assisting the Iraqi
war effort against Iran.
   Meanwhile, the U.S.-led efforts to enforce U.N. sanctions
against Iraq to force that country to withdraw from Kuwait appeared
to widen today.
   Shipping executives said they monitored today the British
warship York questioning a Cypriot-flagged tanker named Glory that
is known be shuttling oil from Iraqi ports.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and subsequently annexed the
country. The U.N. sanctions placed an embargo on oil from Iraq and
Kuwait and blocked imports from Iraq.
   But Iraq remained defiant today.
   The state newspaper Al-Jumhuriya said Iraq knows how to answer
the Bush administration, ``how to foil its measures, penetrate its
blockade, makes its troops taste death if they attack us and move
the battlefield to where it (the United States) does not want or
expect it to be.''
   The paper was quoted by the Iraq News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus.

<HEAD>NYC Guards Block Access to Jail Island In Protest Over Beating Of
Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry correction officers blocked the only
bridge to the city's prison island today in a protest over safety
as top city officials flew there in an effort to defuse the
2-day-old demonstration.
   Some 200 guards, angered by the recent robbery and beating of a
fellow officer by inmates, began blocking the bridge that leads
from Queens to Rikers Island around 6 a.m. Monday. Most jail
workers on the overnight shift at the time have been stuck at the
jail complex ever since.
   ``We are not moving until we get results,'' Correction Officer
Timothy McLilly declared on Monday.
   First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel and Labor Relations
Commissioner Eric Schmertz took a police helicopter to Rikers
Island, joining Correction Commissioner Allyn R. Sielaff in talks
with union officials, a mayoral spokesman said.
   ``The talks are continuing. I can't say what they're centered on
until there's a break and I get to talk to the commissioner,''
Correction Department spokeswoman Ruby Ryles said today.
   ``We're very hopeful it's going to be resolved soon,'' she said.
   A handful of employees were able to get to work or get off the
island before the entrance to the Francis R. Bruono Memorial Bridge
was completely blocked, Ryles said. But, she added, ``basically the
same people who were on since the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift on Sunday
night are still there.''
   Those stranded included Dr. Pearl Brown, who said that she and
about 20 other health care workers could not get off the island.
Correction officials told her the bridge was closed.
   ``I would like to get out of here,'' she said this morning,
adding that like several of her colleagues, she has been unable to
keep up her private practice as a result of the protest.
   On Monday, the action kept inmates from being transported to
court, visitors could not enter, and supply vehicles were stopped,
Ryles said.She also said that several inmates had to be taken off
the island in police launches overnight so they could be treated at
area hospitals.
   Even Sielaff was stopped and had to reach the island by boat to
meet union president Phil Seelig to try to defuse the situation.
Seelig said the union had not authorized the protest.
   The officers were protesting the fact that attempted murder
charges were not brought against three inmates who allegedly
attacked a guard, Steve Norby, 37, last Tuesday. Norby suffered a
broken jaw and other injuries, and his jewelry was stolen,
authorities said.
   The inmates, Gregory Curry, 20, Michael Coleman, 28, and Nathan
Legrand, 21, were charged with first-degree robbery, assault and
promoting prison contraband, Ryles said.

   Operators of a wilderness program for
rebellious teen-agers have been charged with negligence in the
death of a Florida girl and criminal mistreatment of other
youngsters.
   Challenger Foundation founder Stephen Cartisano and field
director Lance Jagger were charged with negligent homicide, a
misdemeanor, in the June 27 death of 16-year-old Kristen Chase of
Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
   The complaint signed Monday before 6th Circuit Judge David L.
Mower also charged Cartisano and Challenger with five counts of
child abuse.
   Mower set arraignment for Sept. 13.
   Chase collapsed while hiking atop the Kaiparowits Plateau in
southern Utah with three other youngsters. An autopsy concluded
that she died of exertional heat stroke, likely complicated by
altitude and near triple-digit temperatures.
   She had been in the program just three days, placed there by her
mother and stepfather.
   Cartisano denied any negligence in the death, and said the girl
suffered from other ailments. Medical Examiner Dr. Todd Grey said
the girl's prior ailments did not contribute to the death.
   Cartisano said the girl had not yet entered the ``impact''
portion of the 63-day program which, according to brochures, strips
rebellious teen-agers of their belligerence through ``five days and
nights of physical and mental stress with forced march, night hikes
and limited food and water.''
   However, two counselors who were with the girl said they were on
a ``forced hike'' and that she had collapsed from heat exhaustion
several times the day before she died.
   ``The tragedy is that when we were going strong, we put over $2
million a year into Kane and Garfield counties,'' Cartisano said
Monday night. ``Now, if they are successful, not only will they
lose that, it is going to cost them hundreds of thousands of
dollars to fight this _ because we are going to fight this like
nothing before.''
   Cartisano repeatedly has claimed Kane County Sheriff Maxwell
Jackson's investigation was politically motivated.
   The Challenger program began two years ago and initially refused
to comply with state regulations governing residential youth
treatment programs. The operators claimed they were not providing
treatment. New laws were enacted during the 1990 Legislature and
went into effect four days after Chase's death.
   Last week, Challenger filed for protection under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with Cartisano citing legal fees and bad
publicity. Challenger listed $63,040 in assets and more than $1.1
million in debts, including some $200,000 in back taxes.

   Denver-area voters were asked today to approve
higher sales taxes to finance a stadium that could attract a major
league baseball team.
   Also on today's ballot were a Democratic primary for the U.S.
Senate and a Republican runoff for a seat in Congress.
   Recent polls showed voters in six Denver-area counties nearly
even on whether to approve the 12-year, 0.1 percent sales tax _ one
cent on each $10 purchase. The measure would raise $139 million.
   Denver is bidding for one of two baseball franchises to be
awarded this year. Baseball proponents hope approval of the tax
will lure a team.
   An estimated 1.8 million people are eligible to vote. Secretary
of State Natalie Meyer projected a turnout of about 35 percent.
   In the Senate race, polls published over the weekend showed
former Boulder County commissioner Josie Heath, 52, ahead of Carlos
Lucero, a 49-year-old lawyer. Heath led by 59 percent to 21
percent, and 41 percent to 32 percent.
   The winner will meet Rep. Hank Brown, a popular Republican who
is giving up his seat in Congress after 10 years to run for the
Senate. Republican Sen. Bill Armstrong is not seeking re-election.
   Republican state Sens. Wayne Allard of Loveland and Jim Brandon
of Akron are vying to face Democrat Richard Bond, who is unopposed
for Brown's congressional seat.

   A leader of the Jewish settler movement
imprisoned for the shooting death of a Palestinian was released
today after serving three months of a five-month sentence.
   Dozens of supporters and two legislators from the right-wing
Likud bloc greeted Rabbi Moshe Levinger on his release from the
minimum security Nir prison. The legislators lifted Levinger on
their shoulders and began dancing in celebration, the national Itim
news agency reported.
   Levinger was convicted by a Jerusalem District Court in April of
causing the shooting death of Kayed Sallah, 42, through negligence.
He plea-bargained to reduce the charge of manslaughter.
   In the Sept. 30, 1988 incident, Levinger fired his pistol
indiscriminately after Palestinians stoned his car. Sallah, who was
standing in front of the shoe store he owned, was killed.
   Levinger vowed today to open fire again if he believed he was in
a life-threatening situation.
   ``If I'm in a situation of danger again, I'll again open fire,''
Levinger said on Israel radio.``I hope that next time, I will be
more careful and I won't miss the target.
   Levinger served only 92 days of his term and was released early
for ``good behavior,'' Prison Authority spokeswoman Shuli Meiri
said.
   Members of the left-wing Mapam party demonstrated outside the
prison to protest Levinger's early release, scuffling with
Levinger's supporters, it said.
   Levinger, a champion of the settlement movement, lives in Kiryat
Arba near the West Bank town of Hebron. Some 75,000 Jewish settlers
live amid 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
War.
   Vehicles driven by Jewish settlers have frequently come under
stoning attacks by Palestinians waging a 32-month uprising against
Israeli rule.
   Betselem, an Israeli information center monitoring human rights
abuses in the occupied territories, has reported that 29
Palestinians have been killed by settlers.

   Young Arabs may by lining up to do battle for
or against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, but America's youth so far have
not responded to the call to arms, military recruiters said today.
   ``No more than usual,'' said an Army recruiting officer in
Durham, North Carolina, when asked if the Middle East crisis had
inspired more enlistments. ``About the same,'' said a recruiter in
Atlanta.
   ``There's been no unusual fluctuation in enlistment,'' said Mary
Auer of the Recruiting Battalion in the Cincinnati area. She said a
``very few people'' who had been in the military before had
inquired about returning, but there had been no surge in new
recruits.
   Major Doug Hart, public affairs officer at the Pentagon, said
enlistment figures are compiled on a quarterly basis and it was too
early to tell whether the threat of war in the Middle East will
increase the number of volunteers.
   ``But if Panama and Grenada are guidelines, there will be no
significant difference'' in enlistments, Hart said, referring to
U.S. military actions in those areas.
   He also cautioned that increased interest in military service
would not necessarily mean more enlistments. ``We are still in a
draw-down period mandated by Congress to make the army smaller,''
Hart said.
   The armed services recruited 128,300 people in the first half of
fiscal year 1990, beginning on Oct. 1, 1989, he said. In fiscal
1989 the figure was 293,900.
   Recruiters said volunteers might increase if fighting breaks out
between the United States and Iraq.
   ``It's kind of quiet here now,'' said a Navy recruiting officer
in Washington D.C. who declined to give his name. ''Maybe if the
crisis goes further we might get some more patriotic responses, but
right now it's business as usual.''

<TEXT>
   A fast-moving forest fire threatened up
to 1,600 homes in northern California, and a state of emergency was
declared for the county where fires have blackened parts of
Yosemite National Park.
   ``The situation in some of these areas may get worse before it
gets better,'' Gov. George Deukmejian said when he declared the
state of emergency for Mariposa County on Monday.
   Fires have burned 210,000 acres of California during the past
week.
   Fires today also blackened parts of Idaho, Utah, Oregon,
Washington and Alaska, said the National Fire Information Center in
Boise, Idaho. It said nearly 22,000 firefighters were at work.
Cooler, damper weather slowed some of the fires.
   Of the 14 major fires in California, the biggest was the
Campbell Complex that had burned about 114,000 acres in Tehama
County.
   But the top priority for firefighters was a smaller Tehama
County fire, the Finley Lake fire east of Red Bluff, that at one
point threatened as many as 400 homes in Manton, 200 in Mineral,
and an additional 1,000 in the general area. It had burned 17,500
acres, officials said.
   Firefighters created a 2-mile-long defense line in Manton,
setting a backfire in hopes it would counter the northbound forest
fire and keep it from destroying homes.
   Manton residents were advised to be ready to evacuate, officials
said.
   The fire also was nearing Lassen National Forest near Mineral
and Lassen Volcanic National Park to the north.
   In Yosemite National Park, three major fires continued to burn
Monday. An estimated 17,000 acres had been charred.
   The A-Rock fire near El Portal burned 13,400 acres, and the
Steamboat fire burned 4,000 acres. Both were about 50 percent
contained today. Sixty-six homes were lost in Foresta last week in
the A Rock fire, and the park's Rancheria Flat settlement was
evacuated.
   An estimated 500 acres were also charred by the Aspen Fire in
Yosemite, which was 20 percent contained Monday. The community of
Aspen Valley was evacuated.
   Flames were within two miles of Yosemite's Merced Grove of giant
sequoia trees.
   Some 12,000 firefighters were at work in California and were to
be joined today by 1,200 soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division at
Fort Carson, Colo.
   Two battalions totaling 1,200 from the 9th Infantry Division at
Fort Lewis, Wash., were arriving in Oregon to relieve firefighters.
   One California firefighter was in critical condition after being
struck by a falling tree limb, and a helicopter pilot suffered a
broken leg and concussion when his craft crashed, officials said.

   A curious worker took home a tiny cylinder
containing the radioactive element cesium which he found near a
factory in central Russia, Pravda reported Tuesday.
   The cylinder was discovered in a shed near the worker's home in
Tula after a routine aerial inspection reported a strong radiation
source, the Communist Party newspaper said. Inspectors using
radiation meters pinpointed the exact location, it said.
   An investigation has begun to determine who lost the cylinder on
the grounds of the Tulachermet Ferrous Metallurgy Enterprise and
when, Pravda said.
   ``It is not ruled out the small-scale Chernobyls may end up not
only in Tula people's sheds but also their homes due to negligence
by officials,'' the newspaper said.
   Pravda said the unidentified worker did not know what was in the
cylinder when he took it home. Cesium is used in photoelectric
cells.

   Two skydivers fell to their deaths Tuesday
after they collided during a jump involving 12 parachutists,
authorities said.
   Officials said Maurizio Moggi, 37, could not open his parachute
in time to avoid a collision with the open parachute of Marco
Bertolini, 22.
   The force of the impact collapsed Bertolini's parachute, causing
both men to plummet to the ground. The accident happened during a
jump by a dozen skydivers from an altitude of 2,640 feet.
   Vittorio Bertolani, an instructor at the parachute school at
Pavullo, told the Italian news agency ANSA that both men were
expert jumpers.

   Police have set up a special telephone
number in hopes of gathering anonymous tips that may help the
government's effort to fight domestic terrorism.
   Starting Tuesday, citizens could dial 170 and provide tips on
terrorism and other violent crimes. ``If they like they can leave
their names or remain anonymous,'' said an officer who replied at
that number.
   ``Most of the calls we received today were evidently hoaxes,''
he added.
   The new phone numnber will not deal with the question of

   In April, the U.S. Embassy in Athens announced the opening of a
Washington D.C. post office box to guarantee secrecy for people
responding to an offer of rewards for information on international
terrorism.
   In Greece, the November 17 leftist terrorist group has claimed
responsibility for killing 14 people, including three American
officials. It has also attacked American servicemen and property
since it first emerged in 1975.
   Despite large rewards offered by the Greek government, private
organizations and the United States, no members of November 17 have
been arrested.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Says Cigarette Sales to Thailand Not Health Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. agriculture secretary, Clayton
Yeutter, said Tuesday that U.S. efforts to force open Thailand's
market to foreign cigarettes have ``nothing whatsoever to do with
health.''
   Yeutter said Thailand discriminates because it allows its
national tobacco monopoly to sell cigarettes, but it forbids
imports.
   He was responding to questions after speaking to the Federation
of Thai Industries. Yeutter will end a four-day visit to Thailand
on Wednesday.
   Anti-smoking groups in the United States and Thailand have
accused the United States and its tobacco industry of trying to
export cancer. They say the sale of U.S. brands will lead to
aggressive advertising and an increase in smoking, especially among
children and women.
   However, foreign brands are readily available on the Thai black
market, which is rarely policed.
   The United States this year asked the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, a global trade organization, to judge the
dispute.
   As the former U.S. trade representative, Yeutter opened
Japanese, South Korean, and Taiwanese markets to foreign cigarettes.
   ``Whether the country be Thailand or Korea or Japan or any
other, including the United States, the rules must be the same for
imported products as they are for domestic products,'' he said.
``It shouldn't make any difference whether it's tobacco ... or
semiconductors or soybeans.''

fellow group members Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli.
   Vola went on to play bass in Ray Ventura's orchestra. He also

   The Chinese government announced Tuesday that it
was evacuating thousands of its citizens from Kuwait, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
   An unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying
Chinese citizens who were involved in business, trade and other
activities in Kuwait were safe but were unable to continue their
work.
   The report did not give a precise figure for the number of
Chinese in Kuwait. Earlier news reports said Chinese in Kuwait
included students as well as diplomats and embassy staff, but also
did not give any figures.
   Xinhua said the Chinese government was contacting the Iraqi
government to request cooperation for the ``smooth return'' of
Chinese from Kuwait to China.
   China has condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and supported a
U.N. Security Council resolution to impose economic sanctions
against Baghdad.
   Beijing supplied billions of dollars of arms to both Iran and
Iraq during their eight-year war and said it will cease arms sales
to Iraq.

<TEXT>
   The government newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday
became the first Soviet publication to register under a new press
law guaranteeing freedom from decades of state censorship.
   While the new law appears to open new opportunities for
prospective publishers and free the media of tight state political
control, another move announced Tuesday could decrease readership.
The State Press Committee announced a doubling in the price of many
publications, blaming increases in the cost of paper, printing
equipment and transportation.
   The popular magazine Ogonyok, which now costs 40 kopecks at the
newstand, will rise to about 1 ruble _ more than double its price.
The price of books also is expected to more than double, officials
said.
   Some politicians have called the planned increases an attack on
glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for greater
openness.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the largest Soviet republic,
Russia, told speakers at a meeting in the northern Russian city of
Vorkuta on Monday that the Soviet parliament had been too easy on
the Communications Ministry.
   ``We should have taken it under control. ... We'll return to the
issue and after that they will probably stop their attacks on
glasnost,'' Yeltsin said in remarks reported by the Interfax news
agency, an arm of Radio Moscow.
   Press committee officials in Moscow said the Communications
Ministry is billions of rubles in debt because of the increases in
production costs.
   They also said newstand prices could remain the same if the
unions and other groups that publish periodicals were willing to
sacrifice their profits to cover the increases.
   Dmitri Mamleyev, first deputy chairman of the State Press
Committee, told a news conference that none of the old or new
national publications applying for registration has been turned
away.
   More than 120 newspapers and other Soviet news organizations
have applied. The new press law, approved unanimously by the
Supreme Soviet in June after months of debate, took effect Aug. 1.
   ``Goodbye, Censorship,'' read an Izvestia headline on the first
day of the new law. On Tuesday, it headlined an article about its
latest move, ``Izvestia Registers No. 1.''
   The new law forbids censorship of the mass media. In addition,
to establish a publication or news organization, Soviets need only
provide their name, address, frequency of publication, circulation
figures and source of financing.
   All will be permitted except those urging the violent overthrow
of the government, promoting racial or religious intolerance or
publishing propaganda for war, violence or cruelty, according to
the law.
   In addition to Izvestia, the government issued certificates
later Tuesday to the Moscow city council's Kuranty (Chime)
newspaper, the privately funded Original and the Academy of
Sciences' Poisk (Quest) newspaper.

   Julio Sastre says he often gets dirty looks from
the neighbors when he waters his garden.
   A ban on garden hoses is in force in drought-hit Kent county and
other parts of southern England, and Sastre says suspicious minds
do not believe that he is simply using water recycled from his bath
and kitchen.
   Drought? In rainy England? Yes indeed. Some areas have gone 36
straight days without rain, and 18 million people are under the
so-called hosepipe ban. Temperatures of more than 85 degrees are
turning parts of the green and pleasant land a depressing brown.
   Says Sastre, who lives in the Kent village of Borstal: ``We
never thought we would have to pray for rain.''
   Some showers fell on Kent on Tuesday but hardly made a
difference, said Chris Lakeland of the London Weather Center.
   ``Unfortunately over the next couple of days the places that
want the rain won't get it, and those that don't want it will,'' he
said.
   In Kent and elsewhere, water authority inspectors are on the
prowl. The fine for illegal hose use has just been raised five-fold
to 2,000 pounds, about $3,750. Neighbor is expected to snitch upon
neighbor.
   ``One doesn't like to encourage the idea of sneaking,'' said
Dennis Field, area manager of Southern Water, Kent's water company.
``We're not trying to cause bad feeling among neigbors.
   ``But if people are suffering under a ban and they see their
neighbors abusing the system, then they're inclined to report
them.''
   Southern Water says Sastre is doing nothing illegal by rigging a
pump to his drainage system and reusing dirty water.
   But in a telephone interview, Field worried about less honest
garden-lovers installing a pump and then running clean water
through it from the faucet.
   Sastre said people often stop and glare at him as he waters the
garden, and one neighbor has reported him to the authorities.
   Traditional English reserve doesn't apply, he said in a
telephone interview. ``These people don't come out and ask me what
I'm doing. I would willingly part with the information. But instead
they just stand there giving me dirty looks.''
   The water companies suffer from an image problem. They have been
broken up into private-sector companies under the Conservative
government's ``privatization'' drive to unload cumbersome
state-owned industries. The consumer sees them as monopolies, more
beholden to shareholders than to customers.
   ``Citizens are invited to ring in anonymously and squeal on
neighbors,'' protested columnist Matthew Parris in the Times of
London.
   ``Thus are we divided and ruled. Instead of joining hands as
brothers in oppression and marching on our monopolist tormentors,
we are to take up arms against one another.''
   The industry blames the problem on a series of dry summers and
winters, which have cut rainfall by 54 percent in some districts,
plus on an antiquated, leaky mains system that will cost billions
to modernize.
   Prosecutions are rare, and not always successful.
   Last year a woman was acquitted after proving that a photograph
provided by a neighbor, which showed her watering her garden, was
taken before the ban was imposed.

commenting on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's proposal to remove
his troops from Kuwait if Israel leaves the occupied territories,
if Syria leaves Lebanon, and if the United States leaves Saudi
Arabia:
   Saddam Hussein has not fired a bullet in return for the American
actions against him. Instead, he has presented a plan for ending
all occupations in the Middle East and to bring about peace to this
troubled area.
   Will all those who have a stake in averting war and massive
destruction give a bit of time to discussing it? The initiative
makes sense to many Arabs, and as such it is worthy of serving as a
basis toward problem-solving in the area.

   From Jordan, the conservative, Arabic language Al-Rai commenting

   This means in clear words that it (Washington) rejected

   It also indicates that Washington blesses the continuation of
Zionist occupation of Arab lands. This enemy is still marching now

   From Egypt, the state-owned, Arabic-language newspaper Al-Ahram,
which reflects government thinking:
   The foreign preparations and the supplies pouring into the gulf
region reflect a previously thought-out plan to stay for a long
time. ... The Americans are talking about preparations to send up
to 250,000 troops to Saudi Arabia, and this gives a wrong
impression that it is an occupation force rather than a protective
force. Therin lies the importance of the Arab League decision to
send Arab troops to support the armed forces of Saudi Arabia and
other gulf countries.

   King Hussein left for Washington today to
meet with President Bush, a day after traveling to Baghdad for
talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   A senior Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the king was carrying a letter to Bush from Saddam. The
official did not disclose the contents of the letter, but said
``his majesty is carrying Saddam Hussein's views to President
Bush.''
   Hussein is scheduled to meet Bush Wednesday.
   The Jordanian official said Hussein will also ``discuss with
President Bush the imposition of United Nations sanctions against
neighboring Iraq and Jordan's stance on the issue.''
   The Jordanian monarch has been trying to act as a mediator in
the crisis created by Saddam's invasion and annexation of the
oil-rich sheikdom of Kuwait two weeks ago.
   The state news agency Petra reported the king's visit to Baghdad
Monday, but gave no details. It also said the king had telephone
contacts with the leaders of Yemen, Tunisia, Sudan and the PLO in
connection with the crisis.
   King Hussein recently spoke of ``my impossible job'' in trying
to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis sparked by Iraq's
invasion and annexation of Kuwait, indicating pessimism that the
crisis could be resolved without violence.
   The king forged a close alliance with Saddam during the 1980
outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war. The Iraqis used a crucial truck
route to Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba to bring in weapons and
other supplies.
   But Hussein also has stressed he still recognizes the government
of the exiled emir.
   The king has taken a strong stand against the dispatch of U.S.
forces to Saudi Arabia to protect its against a possible Iraqi
attack, as well as against the decision of an Arab summit
conference to send Arab troops to join the Americans.
   King Hussein maintains that the Kuwait crisis must be solved
within an Arab context, excluding any foreign intervention.

   Trade sanctions of the type
imposed on Iraq by the United Nations are difficult to enforce and
often take a long time to work.
   The United Nations has only twice before imposed trade sanctions
on nations _ South Africa and Rhodesia. In both cases, the
sanctions failed to have any immediate impact, and sometimes they
helped rather than hurt the nations.
   For example, the South African and Rhodesian governments both
found that the international condemnation increased their internal
support. The idea of fighting back against an unsympathetic world
united whites in both nations.
   ``Let's show them. Be South African. Buy South African,'' said
the slogan of an anti-sanctions campaign.
   The U.N. Security Council voted Aug. 6 to ban most trade with
Iraq to force it to pull out of Kuwait. The sanctions, the toughest
imposed by the United Nations in its 45-year history, are designed
to cripple the oil-dependent Iraqi economy and force a quick
capitulation.
   The only comparable action was when the United Nations imposed
trade sanctions on Rhodesia in 1967 to force the white-minority
government to share power with the black majority after it broke
away from Britain. A far less harsh arms embargo was imposed on
South Africa in 1977 to protest apartheid, and it is still in force.
   The restrictions imposed on Iraq, such as cutting off pipelines
that carry Iraqi oil, have been put in to place far more quickly
and strictly than the measures imposed on Rhodesia and South Africa.
   And while many U.N. members secretly violated the sanctions
against Rhodesia and South Africa, the United States and other
nations are using their power and extensive monitoring capabilities
to ensure the sanctions against Iraq are not broken.
   Ironically, the U.N. sanctions helped strengthen the Rhodesian
economy at first. The country was forced to reduce dependence on
imports and develop its own industries to provide vital goods. This
made it stronger.
   Rhodesia's economy boomed during the first year of sanctions. At
least 250,000 new jobs were created and economic growth averaged
about 10 percent annually in the first 10 years after Rhodesia
declared independence.
   South Africa became a vital conduit for Rhodesia. Oil and other
commodities were shipped through South Africa, evading U.N.
sanctions. Foreign businesses helped evade sanctions for high
profits, and Rhodesians set up dummy foreign firms to channel
imports and exports.
   At least 60 U.N. nations ignored sanctions, secretly purchasing
Rhodesian chrome, copper, tea and tobacco. Nations breaking
sanctions included the Soviet Union, China and Czechoslovakia,
which were arming the black guerrilla movements fighting the
Rhodesian government.
   But the wave of Rhodesian prosperity also depended on the
healthy world economy during the 1960s and early 1970s. When the
world economy dipped, the Rhodesian economy started to suffer, and
sanctions began to bite.
   South Africa, facing problems of its own, withdrew backing for
Rhodesia, and ultimately sanctions began to take effect. Eventually
the government was forced to capitulate in the face of growing
guerrilla activity and accept elections that ended white rule in
1980.
   South Africa responded to the U.N. arms embargo by developing
one of the world's most sophisticated arms industries. Faced by a
cutoff of arms imports, state companies developed everything from
aircraft to warships and tanks.
   South Africa's arms exports include long-range artillery to Iraq.
   South African military commanders have said the U.N. sanctions
were a blessing in disguise for the country's military
self-sufficiency.
   But other sanctions imposed by Western nations on South Africa
have had more of an impact. The economy has suffered from cutoffs
of credit and loans from Western banks, disinvestment by foreign
firms and limits on exports and imports.
   ``Sanctions did certainly undercut economic growth, mostly
because of capital constraints,'' said Nico Czypionka, chief
economist of the Standard Bank.

   The Bush administration today called in
foreign ambassadors to consider ways to safeguard warships in the
Persian Gulf from Iraqi reprisals. U.S. officials said Jordan's
King Hussein would meet with President Bush on Thursday.
   As the gulf crisis deepened, the government urged Americans
stranded in Kuwait not to flee ``due to the danger involved.'' Bush
was flying back to Washington for a late afternoon news conference
and a briefing by Pentagon military chiefs.
   Hussein was said to be carrying a letter to Bush from Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein. The king has hoped to serve as a mediator
between Saddam and the United States. By hesitating to support the
embargo approved last week by the U.N. Security Council, he has
maintained his position as a middle-man.
   Hussein will arrive in Washington Wednesday and then fly
Thursday to the president's vacation retreat in Kennebunkport,
Maine, the White House said. Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Hussein called Bush Monday night and requested the meeting.
   The details of the Saddam letter were not disclosed.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with
Kuwait's Foreign Minister, al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah. The envoy
for Kuwait's exiled rulers declined comment on their hour-long
discussion at the State Department.
   In Atlanta, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney warned Saddam
against using chemical weapons against American troops. He said
there was a ``wide range of measures'' available to Bush if Saddam
uses chemical weapons, but indicated strongly that the use of
American chemical weapons stock was not in the cards.
   ``I cannot conceive of a situation where the United States would
want to use chemical weapons. We're trying to discourage all
nations in the world on their reliance,'' he said at a news
conference at Ft. Stewart, Ga.
   Cheney said Iraq has 200,000 troops in Kuwait and the southern
part of his own country, which abuts Saudi Arabia. ``The notion
that we have overreacted is not a valid one at all,'' he said at
Ft. Stewart, Ala. He said the deployment of forces ``has
discouraged further aggression.''
   In Washington, ambassadors from the Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China _ the four other permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ were called to the State Department for the
consultations. Two options will be discussed: creating a joint
military command under the United Nations and having the ships
carry a United Nations flag, a senior U.S. official told The
Associated Press.
   ``We would need to know what the role of the U.S. Navy would
be,'' the official said. ``We have to exchange ideas.''
   The first idea, advanced initially by the Soviet Union, is to
set up a joint chiefs of staff under the Security Council to
coordinate defense of the U.S., British, French and other warships
in the Gulf should they come under Iraqi fire, the official said.
   The second option under consideration is to give the warships
the protection of the U.N. flag.
   The United States was criticized Monday in New York by Cuba _
and questioned also by Canada, France and Malaysia _ for sending an
armada to the Gulf.
   The official called the closed U.N. meeting, held at Cuba's
behest, an informal session.
   He said the ships were in the gulf area at the request of Saudi
Arabia and the Kuwaiti government toppled by Iraq. He said the
United States would engage in combat _ individually or collectively
_ only if fired upon and under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.
   The Soviet, British, French and Chinese ambassadors were called
to the office of Robert Kimmitt, the undersecretary of state for
political affairs, to see if their governments would go along with
the proposals.
   ``The joint chiefs have never performed this role before,'' the
official said of the idea of forming a joint military command.
``The very fact we are exploring this ... mechanism shows we have
no intention of ignoring the United Nations.''
   The U.N. Security Council last Monday called for worldwide
economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of neighboring
oil-rich Kuwait. It was only the third such step taken by the
Council in the 45-year history of the United Nations. Cuba and
Yemen abstained from the 13-0 vote.
   Then, on Thursday, by unanimous vote, the 15 members of the
Security Council declared Iraq's annexation of Kuwait ``null and
void.''
   In the meantime, the United States, Britain, Australia and about
a dozen other nations sent warships to the Gulf. But the Security
Council has not moved to enforce the sanctions with a military
blockade.
   Concern heightened over the fate of Americans trapped in Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia.
   The Voice of America, a radio service operated by the U.S.
government, is urging the Americans still in Kuwait not to try to
cross the border ``due to the danger involved,'' but advising them
to get ready to leave on short notice.
   ``When the orderly evacuation of Americans wishing to leave
Kuwait becomes possible, American citizens will be contacted by
phone or by radio and information will be broadcast by the Voice of
America and the BBC,'' VOA broadcasts said.
   About 500 Americans already have been able to sneak into Saudi
Arabia, penetrating lax Iraqi security, but a caravan of others who
tried to flee were forced to beat a sweltering retreat.
   The clandestine departures reduce the number of civilian
Americans in Kuwait to 2,500, according to State Department
figures. Also stranded are 500 to 600 Americans in Iraq.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
systematically and ruthlessly eliminated dissent since he took
power 11 years ago. The economic siege of Iraq likely will bring
new hardship to his people, but it's open to question whether this
will trigger serious opposition to his rule.
   A few weeks before he sent his troops into Kuwait on Aug. 2,
Saddam arrested more than 40 senior military commanders in the
latest of his periodic purges of men he suspected could challenge
him, Iraqi dissident sources say.
   Generals who became too popular during the 1980-88 war with Iran
have disappeared, fate unknown. Others died in a series of
helicopter and auto accidents. They included Saddam's cousin, Adnan
Khairallah, who was the defense minister.
   Whether the latest reported purge was linked to Saddam's
invasion plans is not clear. But dissidents from various factions
were reporting for some time before the arrests that there was
discontent in the upper echelons of the military.
   Saddam, 54, is the absolute ruler of Iraq and its 16 million
people. He operates through the nine-man Revolutionary Command
Council and the Baath Party, which has been in power since a 1968
coup. After years as vice president and the real power in the
ruling Baath Arab Socialist Party, Saddam shunted aside President
Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr to take over the presidency.
   Saddam has packed key positions with his relatives, by blood or
marriage. They answer to him alone.
   He is chairman of the Command Council and is also prime
minister. He has a handful of long-time aides, such as First Deputy
Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan, who is considered his
second-in-command.
   Another important figure is Tariq Aziz, the only Christian in
his 24-man Cabinet. He is a deputy prime minister and foreign
minister and Saddam's main adviser on foreign policy. Both are
members of the Command Council.
   But Saddam is believed to wield almost total power.
   He is a member of the minority Sunni Moslem sect. Some 55
percent of Iraqis are Shiite Moslems, like most of Iran's 55
million people.
   ``Iraq is a well-organized police state and its government is
one of the most brutal and repressive regimes in power today ....
With the exception of freedom of worship, the Iraqi government ...
ruthlessly suppresses even the smallest gesture of dissent,'' the
U.S.-based Middle East Watch human rights group said in a recent
report.
   Saddam controls Iraq's 1 million-strong armed forces and the
country's security and intelligence apparatus. His intelligence
services have hunted down and killed leading dissidents living
abroad.
   Iraqis are encouraged to inform on their neighbors. During the
Iran-Iraq war, Saddam publicly decorated fathers who turned in
deserter sons.
   Publicly insulting Saddam is a capital offense, and sources in
Baghdad said some Iraqis who made jokes about Saddam had their
tongues ripped out.
   After the war against Iran, Saddam announced a package of
reforms including a multiparty system, press freedom and
presidential elections.
   Diplomats, however, said the changes were little more than
cosmetic, to keep Iraqis acquiescent. That belief was underlined
when the compliant parliament last month called for Saddam to be
named president for life without any elections.
   Diplomats now expect Saddam to shelve the promised reforms,
citing the crisis that he triggered.
   The U.N. sanctions against Iraq are the toughest ever imposed by
the world body and are expected to be felt quickly. Saddam on
Sunday called on Iraqis to tighten their belts for what are certain
to be difficult days ahead.
   How long it might take for discontent to emerge is hard to say.
Iraqis withstood hardship and shortages during the war with Iran,
but the cease-fire raised expectations of better days.
   Iraq's official media daily churn out slogans hailing Saddam as
the new Saladin, the 12th century Moslem warrior who defeated the
Crusaders and recaptured Jerusalem. The reports make no mention of
dissent.
   The reference to Saladin is ironic. Saladin was a Kurd, and his
descendants are among the tough mountain people who have been
waging a fierce war for independence against the Baghdad regime.
   In March 1988, Iraqi warplanes dropped poison gas bombs on the
Kurdish town of Halabja, killing some 5,000 civilians. Western
reporters who reached the town reported seeing hundreds of men,
women and children dead.
   After the fighting with Iran stopped, Saddam launched a major
campaign against the Kurds, again reportedly using chemical weapons.
   Saddam's other oppponents include the Iran-backed ad-Dawa
Islami, or Islamic Call, a Shiite fundamentalist movement that has
assassinated scores of Iraqi diplomats and senior officials.
   Hundreds of members, along with their entire families, have been
reported executed.

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein's government is now
calling Kuwait one of the ``cities of southern Iraq'' after
annexing the oil-rich state.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and installed a ``provisional
government of free Kuwait.'' That government in turn declared a
``republic.'' Just 24 hours later, Iraq declared that it had
annexed Kuwait.
   Iraqi spokesmen are now referring to ``Kuwait, al-Jahra ... and
other cities of southern Iraq.'' Al-Jahra is one of the
municipalities that made up the former state.
   Under the ousted emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, Kuwait was
known as the State of Kuwait. It bridled at being called an
``emirate,'' because in Arabic that term connotes a tiny sheikdom
or fiefdom.

   President Bush pressured Japan on Tuesday to ``do
its utmost'' and increase its participation in international
efforts to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait.
   Japanese officials said they were debating what Tokyo should do
because of a constitutional ban on overseas military activities.
The ban stems from Japan's defeat by the United States in World War
II and the postwar occupation of Japan by U.S. forces.
   It was the third time Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had
conferred by telephone about the Middle East crisis since the Aug.
2 invasion.
   A call from Bush two days after the invasion helped speed
Japan's decision to announce economic sanctions. Kaifu then called
the U.S. president to report Japan's action.
   In the latest phone call, Bush told Kaifu he hopes Japan ``will
do its utmost,'' including providing support to Middle East
countries ``that have sacrificed a great deal'' following the
invasion, the Foreign Ministry said.
   Kaifu responded that Japan ``is considering how it can cooperate
effectively,'' according to a ministry official. ``We are
evaluating what sort of cooperation is most suitable for Japan,''
he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Bush did not specify what contributions Japan should make, but
his request for maximum efforts probably includes support for the
U.S.-led multinational force that is blocking Iraqi shipping in the
Persian Gulf region, said the ministry official.
   Japan's postwar constitution forbids the use of force to resolve
international disputes. Defense Agency officials say the country
cannot by law send military units to join the multinational force.
   As a result, ``Japan does not have any idea what to do beyond
joining in the economic sanctions that have already been decided
upon,'' the nationally circulated Asahi Shimbun said in an
editorial Tuesday.
   Tokyo's sanctions include a trade embargo on Iraq and Kuwait,
which together supplied 11.2 percent of Japan's oil this year.
   Japan's inability to decide on additional actions contributed to
Kaifu's decision Monday to postpone a planned visit this week to
the Middle East, news reports said.
   Advisers worried that if Kaifu made the trip without announcing
new actions, it would give the impression Japan was not doing its
share to help resolve the crisis, political aides said.
   Japan found itself in a similar situation in 1987, when the West
demanded it aid in the effort against Iraqi and Iranian attacks on
oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Japan eventually financed a
navigation system to keep track of ships in the gulf. It also gave
Jordan loans and grants worth about $550 million and a credit line
of $300 million, and increased the money it paid to support U.S.
troops based in Japan.
   The Japanese government decided against sending a minesweeper to
the gulf, as other countries did at that time, because of its ban
on military action overseas.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Monday that Japan was
determined to decide on ``concrete measures'' to help in the
crisis. Makoto Watanabe, director of the ministry's Middle Eastern
affairs bureau, said the government ``will examine all possible
measures while observing the provisions of the constitution.''
   ``In this rapidly changing world, Japan will be forced to make
decisions on its own more frequently,'' the nationally circulated
Yomiuri Shimbun said in an editorial Tuesday. ``It is now the time
for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties
to start discussions to decide what Japan can and cannot do.''

   President Bush interrupted his
summer vacation to return to the White House on Tuesday for a
Pentagon briefing and a meeting with advisers on the impact of the
Persian Gulf crisis on America's economy.
   The president will return on Wednesday to Kennebunkport where he
will meet with Jordan's King Hussein on the crisis created by
Iraq's invasion and annexation of the oil-rich sheikdom of Kuwait
two weeks ago.
   A senior Jordanian official said in Amman that the king was
carrying a letter to Bush from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   In the flurry of high-level diplomacy, Bush also was to meet
late Tuesday in Washington with Foreign Minister Sheikh
Saud-Al-Sabah of Kuwait.
   Although Bush deemed it necessary to break away for Tuesday's
budget briefing, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady decided not to
interrupt his own trip to take part in the talks. Brady, a key
member of the budget team, remained in the Midwest on a two-day
campaign swing for Republican politicians.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said Bush would
meet with budget advisers Tuesday afternoon and travel to the
Pentagon on Wednesday for an update on the gulf.
   Before leaving for Washington on Tuesday, Bush squeezed in a
morning ride in the Atlantic on his high-speed boat, Fidelity.
Returning to the dock, he showed off a 27-inch, 12-pound bluefish
he caught.
   The president arrived at his seaside estate on rocky Walker's
Point on Friday and is to remain here until Labor Day, with
occasional quick trips back to Washington. Bush says he is
confident that Americans do not begrudge him a vacation mixed with
business.
   White House officials said the tense situation in the gulf
dramatized the need for Congress and the administration to reach a
deficit-cutting agreement to slash spending and raise taxes.
   The gulf crisis already has caused a spike in oil prices,
creating a further drag on a sluggish U.S. economy tottering closer
to a recession. The administration has said that the conflict could
bring the economy's already-anemic growth rate ``closer to zero,''
but that a recession is not inevitable.
   Fitzwater said Bush wanted an update on the slow-moving budget
talks with Congress. He said the president ``might want some
discussion of any changes in our budget proposals that might have
to be made to reflect the war.''

   Palestinians chanting ``Death to America!''
burned American and Israeli flags Tuesday in one of several rallies
in the occupied territories in support of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   In a response to growing anti-American sentiments among
Palestinians, the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv urged Americans working
in the occupied Gaza Strip to exercise caution, embassy officials
said.
   Sources in Gaza said Americans were told not to enter trouble
spots such as Palestinian refugee camps, where many pro-Saddam
rallies have been held.
   ``There is something building up against the Americans. We are
certainly on the watch. We are aware that the first target would be
Americans,'' said Alexandra Senfft, spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency in Gaza. The agency employs three Americans and
assists Palestinian refugees, mainly by providing education and
medical care.
   She said she did not know whether American staffers were pulled
off their duties in the refugee camps.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Langford said he was not aware of
warnings issued to Americans in the West Bank. He said he did not
know how many Americans were working in the occupied territories.
   Palestinians are celebrating Saddam as a national savior who can
win back the West Bank and Gaza Strip and teach a lesson to the
Americans. Israel seized the territories from Jordan and Egypt
during the 1967 Middle East War.
   The support reached a near-frenzy earlier this week after Saddam
linked a possible Iraqi pullout from Kuwait to an Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied lands. Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The strongest expressions of anti-American sentiment Tuesday
were reported in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   About 100 Palestinians chanted ``Death to America'' as five
activists of the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas set alight
American and Israeli flags, Arab reporters said.
   Later, about 300 Palestinian marched through the Nablus market
chanting ``Long live Saddam'' and other pro-Iraqi slogans.
   In Gaza City, dozens of youths chanted ``Saddam is here'' as
they stoned Israeli border police.
   Slogans supporting Saddam appeared throughout the occupied
lands. In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, soldiers ordered
residents to paint over the slogans.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens on Tuesday urged Palestinians not
to support Iraq.
   ``They are throwing their support behind a bloodthirsty
dictator. If it should lead to any increase or any acts of violence
in the area, we'll know how to take care of them,'' Arens said on
Israel radio.
   The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that troops were under
orders to prevent any show of support for Saddam and to disperse
pro-Iraqi demonstrations.
   Military officials denied it. ``We disperse demonstrations when
we believe they will lead to violence, regardless of their theme,''
said an army official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   A fishing boat carrying 50 people who were
being forced back to China rammed into a Taiwanese navy patrol ship
and sank, and 21 people from the fishing boat were missing, the
navy said Tuesday.
   In a news release, the navy said the accident occurred at 10:05
p.m. Monday when the Chinese vessel, Min Ping Yu No. 5202, sailed
``irregularly'' and slammed into the patrol ship. The navy ship was
monitoring the forced repatriation of the illegal aliens from
mainland China.
   The collision was at sea 13 miles north of the port of Keelung.
The statement said 29 people from the fishing boat were rescued,
and 21 were missing. Those saved were taken back to Keelung.
   The boat had left Nan Fang Ao, a fishing port in northeastern
Taiwan, on Monday to return to China under orders of the government
of Taiwan.
   Except for the crewmen, those on board were put in a cabin
nailed shut with wood planks over the door. This was to prevent the
illegal immigrants from jumping overboard and trying to return to
Taiwan, officials said.
   Taiwan has repatriated more than 10,000 mainland Chinese since
1987 by forcing fishing boats that sneak into Taiwanese waters to
return to China.
   Over the last decade, tens of thousands of Chinese have tried to
illegally enter Taiwan to seek a better life on the prosperous
island.
   Last week, China's official Xinhua News Agency claimed Taiwanese
authorities sealed 26 Chinese in the cabins of a fishing boat and
sent them back to China, causing 25 of them to suffocate to death.
   Taiwan denied the report and said authorities repatriated
mainland Chinese in humane way.
   The Nationalist government was driven from the mainland to
Taiwan by the Communists in 1949.

   Retail sales were virtually flat in July,
edging up just 0.1 percent, the government said Tuesday, and
analysts predicted consumers will cut back spending even further
because of rising oil prices.
   The Commerce Department said sales rose a seasonally adjusted
$149.5 billion last month, up just $132 million from June.
   Nevertheless, some economists were encouraged by upward
revisions showing stronger sales in May and June than previously
had been reported.
   ``When you combine July with a restatement of more momentum in
the prior months, you've got a consumer hinting at a firming of
demand as the second half of the year got under way,'' said Steven
S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   But that data has been ``rendered obsolete'' for now by the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resulting surge in oil prices,
Roach and other analysts added.
   If the price of oil remains about $25 a barrel, ``the average
American household will pay $260 more per year,'' Roach said.
``That obviously will put a crimp in consumer buying.''
   ``The impact will have to be negative,'' agreed Lea Tyler,
senior economist with the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``The
question is, how big?''
   Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity and has fueled much of the economic growth since
the last recession ended in 1982. Retail sales themselves represent
about half of overall consumer spending.
   In its revisions, the Commerce Department said June sales jumped
a strong 1.1 percent rather than the 0.5 percent gain it reported
last month. At the same time, it said May sales declined just 0.1
percent rather than the 0.7 percent first believed.
   The adjustment in the May figure, combined with declines in
April and March, still meant sales had fallen for three consecutive
months _ the first time that had happened since the recession year
of 1981.
   Sales of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more
than three years _ rose 0.3 percent in July following a 0.4 percent
gain the previous month. Building materials were up 3.9 percent
while furniture and other household furnishing sales rose 2.5
percent.
   But a 0.6 percent tumble in automobile sales wiped out a 0.6
percent advance in June. Weakness in auto sales has been a major
factor contributing to the overall sluggishness of consumer
spending this year.
   Excluding autos, retail sales were up 0.3 percent.
   Non-durable goods sales were unchanged following a 1.5 percent
gain in June.
   Department store sales posted a 0.8 percent advance after a
revised 3.5 percent increase the previous month. June department
store sales first were reported to have risen 2.8 percent. Grocery
store sales were up 0.4 percent while drug store sales climbed 0.6
percent.
   But sales fell in three non-durable sectors _ gasoline station
purchases were off 0.3 percent, clothing sales were down 0.9
percent and sales at restaurants and bars fell 0.4 percent.

   Reviving traditions as old as Arab
history, two renowned Arab poets have brandished virulent words
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's military stab into Kuwait.
   Writers have unleashed a barrage of condemnations and
lamentations that depict Saddam as a ``knight-turned-thief'' and an
``ungrateful, perfidious brother.''
   Ghazi al-Gusaibi, a respected thinker and former Cabinet
minister who now serves as Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Bahrain,
fired the first poetic salvo.
   Suad al-Sabah, cousin of the exiled emir of Kuwait and a
confirmed poet, wrote in London a vow that Kuwaitis will fight on
to liberate their homeland. Her poem was widely distributed in the
Persian Gulf.
   Demoting Saddam to a ``fallen, disgraced knight,'' al-Gusaibi
reminded him that he owes his might and stature to Arab
benefactors. He was alluding to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia which,
according to gulf-based Arab and Western diplomats, poured more
than $34 billion into Iraqi coffers to help defray costs of the
1980-88 war with Iran.
   ``We turned you into our sword, but look...the sword has cut a
deep wound into our heart,'' al-Gusaibi decried in the poem,
published in the pro-government newspaper al-Sharq al-Awsat. ``And
once you were our shield, but behold... the shield has turned into
a burning lance in our back.''
   The poet wondered how the gulf Arabs once looked upon Saddam as
a trusted friend, and how they took him for a faithful brother. He
reminded the Iraqi leader of his war with Iran ``When we shared
with you our bread, when we wrote with our blood a covenant for
which we bled.''
   ``You were our army, tell us if you may...How you lost the way
to Jerusalem?'' al-Gusaibi asked. ``A giant in our eyes you were,
how ugly a giant you've become ... In the dark you've killed a
tender (Kuwait) bird.''
   He dismissed Saddam as a ``disfigured knight, turning into a
killer-thief in the dead of night...an insolent liar outright.''
   Saddam will not last, he concluded, because ``No perfidious
comrade ever can survive.''
   The poet, once a leading citizen of the oil-rich kingdom, in
recent years lost his Cabinet portfolio on account of a poem in
which he bitterly criticized his king.
   The Kuwaiti emir's cousin writing in London said:
   ``Never will you steal from us daylight... You came at dawn with
a tank that we'll fight...We'll resist the tank and the rogue ...
has a tank ever conducted a dialogue?''
   ``We, young and old, reject oppression... Wherever you go in
Kuwait, with vile aggression ... sands will turn into rocks of
gloom, and the sea into a fire of doom,'' she wrote. ``What you
(Saddam) dub a great epic and stride, I call it a tragic fall and
suicide.''
   Ms. al-Sabah reviled Saddam who ``ruthlessly ruined my
home...when we gave him in our hearts a home... We gave him God's
victory and exaltation...and he repaid us with invasion and
occupation.''
   She lamented ``a stab in my back with an Arab sword, tinges
history with disgrace... when my cousin slaughters me with no
warning word, the Arab unity dream becomes sawdust flying in
space.''
   Poetic expression is an Arab legacy dating back to pre-Islamic
times, when the bards and orators assembled with their tribal
groups once a year at a marketplace called Okaz to compete for
acclaim.
   Tribal wars, peace treaties and vendettas were attributed to
Okaz poems. Concepts of unfounded pride, exaggerated praise and
slander that elevated common men to legendary heights and
humiliated kings also were attributed to Okaz poems.
   Kuwaiti poet Abdul-Rahman al-Najjar joined the current parade of
anti-Saddam poets with nine lines in the London-based Kuwaiti
newspaper al-Qabas International.
   ``Sons of homeland, O son, remain free...despite fires,
misfortune and the invasion spree,'' he wrote. ``Folks of dignity
are never deterred, be them living or even interred.''
   The current poetic fury reminds Persian Gulf nationals of the
Egyptian poets Ahmed Fuad Nejm and the blind Sheik Imam, who
composed prolific ballads against the late President Gamal
Abdel-Nasser and his successor, Anwar Sadat.
   One of their last ones discussed the U.S.-brokered Camp David
peace treaties between Egypt and Israel.
   ``They have sold our guns and our galabiya (native robe) for a
phony peace,'' Imam wailed. ``In moving sands, forlorn Egypt is
lonesome without its Arab folks.''

   United Press International will lay off 31
employees, transfer others and leave some small news bureaus with
no staff as part of a series of organizational changes, the news
agency said Tuesday.
   The Washington-based wire service is also negotiating to
purchase the use of the news report of States News Service, another
Washington-based news organization, as part of a joint venture
intended to supplement its own coverage of the federal government,
a UPI spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Milt Capps, said four regional reporters who had
been tailoring UPI reports of federal news for individual states
and regions will be assigned other duties.
   He said UPI's coverage on Capitol Hill will not otherwise be
affected.
   Capps said the layoffs involve 16 fulltime employees and 15
probationary staff members in UPI bureaus around the country.
   The Washington Post said the wire service plans to eliminate
one-person bureaus in Green Bay, Wis.; Scranton, Pa.; Atlantic
City, N.J.; Springfield, Mass. and Fairfax County, Va.
   Capps confirmed that reporting of news in nearby Fairfax County
will now be handled by UPI's Washington bureau but said he would
not address other details.
   He did say that although some of the news bureaus are not now
being staffed, UPI has not closed them and retains the option of
reassigning reporters to them.
   ``We aren't reducing any of our coverage in those areas,'' Capps
said. ``We do not consider that there will be any substantive
change in our reporting from those regions.''
   He said the changes are part of a long-term strategy aimed at
trimming personnel costs while sharing news reporting with
joint-venture partners, including Financial News Network, a cable
television network.
   UPI is owned by Infotechnology Inc., which also owns 47 percent
of FNN.
   ``Our aim is to free up additional resources to differentiate
UPI's reports from those of our competitors in ways that cannot be
easily duplicated,'' Capps said.

<HEAD>Women's Focus on Depression May Lengthen It, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women may have longer depressions than men partly
because they tend to dwell more on the low mood, a researcher
suggested Tuesday.
   That may be a way to figure out why the depression occurred, but
works ``in a way that gets you stuck in a downward cycle,'' said
Susan Nolen-Hoeksema.
   Some small preliminary studies lend support to the hypothesis,
the Stanford University researcher said at the annual meeting of
the American Psychological Association.
   She called it one of several possible explanations for recent,
early evidence that women tend to have longer depressions and run a
higher risk of multiple episodes.
   The rumination reaction includes focusing on such things as how
tired and unmotivated one feels, and on possible causes and
consequences of the depression.
   It contrasts with a ``distractive'' response, in which a person
does things to get his or her mind off the depression.
   In one study, 43 men and 36 women, all depressed, filled out a
form every day for a month. They reported how they felt that day,
how severe the depression was, and which of 32 coping responses
they used that day.
   On average, women reported more ruminative responses, such as
seeking solitude to think about their depression, than men did.
Their average was about three out of the 16 listed, versus two for
the men, Nolen-Hoeksema said.
   The difference was statistically significant, she said. No one
person could report all 16 ruminative responses because some of
them were mutually exclusive, she said.
   Analysis also showed that the degree of rumination was related
to the depression's impact on a person, she said. Impact accounted
for severity and duration of depression.
   Degree of rumination also was related to the number of days that
a person felt moderate or severe depression, she said. Gender
played no role in that, she said.
   In a second study, 25 men and 25 women were made to feel sad by
reading a sad story. Then they could choose a card-sorting task
that focused on their feelings, or a distracting card-sorting task
in which they ranked nations by level of industrialization.
   Seventy-nine percent of the women but only 52 percent of the men
chose the emotion task, Nolen-Hoeksema said.
   Her hypothesis appears ``very plausible'' as a partial
explanation for the sex differences in depression, said psychology
professor Paul Blaney of the University of Miami.
   Studying such vulnerabilities in women may lead to identifying
them in some men as well, he said.

<HEAD>Administration Denies Subsidizing Mexico's Debt Reduction
Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Treasury official vigorously denied
Tuesday a congressman's charge that the Bush administration spent
$192 million to subsidize Mexico's debt reduction agreement with
commercial banks.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said such a Mexican transaction, completed in January,
is just one of a number of ``back-door financing schemes'' put
together ``behind closed doors'' to fund Treasury's international
operations.
   ``Mexico's important. ... I come from a Mexican background, but
I never felt that we had to give the family jewels in order to
prove that we're good neighbors,'' Gonzalez told David C. Mulford,
under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, at a
hearing.
   ``We do not believe in producing subsidies for foreign
governments,'' Mulford replied. ``The entire debt strategy is an
indication that our efforts have been devoted to curing this
problem without recourse to taxpayers money.''
   The Mexican deal was the first and most important struck under
the so-called Brady plan. Named after Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady, it seeks to force banks to forgive part of the crushing
$1.3 trillion debt burden on Third World countries in exchange for
economic reforms in the nations that will make it possible for them
to pay their remaining debts.
   At issue is whether the United States gave Mexico a favorable
price when it sold $2.99 billion in zero-coupon Treasury bonds.
Mexico used the bonds as collateral to guarantee repayment of its
remaining debt after commercial banks agreed to accept some losses
on the debt.
   Mulford maintained that Mexican purchase of the bonds in effect
saved U.S. taxpayers more than $100 million compared with what the
United States would have had to spend to raise the money in the
standard way _ selling interest-paying bonds through financial
markets.
   However, the General Accounting Office, Congress auditing arm,
disputed that. It said the zero-coupon bonds sold to Mexico are the
equivalent of a derivative bond product known as STRIPS, which,
like a zero-coupon bond, pays no interest.
   Both zero-coupon bonds and STRIPS are sold at a deep discount
from the face value. The bondholder reaps a profit by receiving the
full face value at maturity, 30 years later.
   The price of the bonds sold to Mexico should have been set in
relation to the price of STRIPS, which generally is somewhat lower
than the price of similar interest-bearing bonds, the GAO said.
   However, ''Treasury set a price for the bonds that involved an
effective subsidy of approximately $192 million,'' said Allan I.
Mendelowitz, the GAO's director of international finance issues.
   Gonzalez said the larger issue was the law which gives the
Treasury secretary power to make such decisions without
congressional authorization. He said it amounts to a circumvention
of the congressional appropriations process.
   However, Mulford said Treasury would continue to consider using
zero-coupon bonds as it thought proper as part of Third World debt
reduction deals. He said such bonds likely would be used as part of
a deal in process between banks and Venezuela.
   Gonzalez was the only member of his 51-member panel to attend
the hearing. Congress is in recess for its summer vacation.

   The networks' coverage of the Middle East crisis
last week boosted ratings for their evening newscasts by 19 percent
and gave them a larger average audience than prime-time
entertainment shows.
   The increase was due to public interest in the news from the
Middle East and U.S. military movements there, said NBC research
vice president Preston Beckman. ``I have no doubt about that,'' he
said Tuesday.
   CBS, NBC and ABC evening newcasts collectively averaged a 28.8
rating and a 60 percent share of the audience last week, compared
with a 28.1 rating and 53 share for prime time programs, Nielsen
audience estimates showed.
   ABC's front-running ``World News Tonight'' averaged a 10.6
rating. ``The CBS Evening News,'' whose anchor, Dan Rather, has
been in the Middle East since Iraq's Aug. 2 in invasion of Kuwait,
averaged a 9.3. ``NBC Nightly News'' ran third with an 8.9 average.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. The audience share
is the estimated percentage of homes tuned to a given program in
its time period.
   ABC research vice president Alan Wurtzel said that it's rare for
news ratings to do better than entertainment ratings. He attributed
last week's ratings both to viewer interest in the crisis and ``the
summer doldrums in prime time viewing.''
   CNN officials said their network's ratings had generally
doubled; the newscasts were seen in 763,000 homes Friday night, and
659,000 homes on Sunday.
   Viewers of Monday night's network newscasts saw the first TV
footage from a press pool flown out to the carrier Independence in
the Gulf of Oman.
   CBS anchorman Rather, among the correspondents on the big ship,
taped his anchor portion of the ``CBS Evening News'' there.
   Although the TV correspondents had to share pool video footage
shot by a network cameraman, Rather's report included a home-video
segment taped by an unidentified sailor. It showed Rather touring
the ship and interviewing crewmen.
   While in the ship's boiler room, Rather, using a microphone
attached to the sailor's videocamera, alluding to the star of ``Top
Gun,'' told viewers: ``Tom Cruise doesn't make movies about this
place.''
   ``Hi, Mom and Dad,'' said one grinning young sailor as Rather
held the microphone up for him.
   Under press pool rules, CBS had to share Rather's home-video
footage, some of which was fuzzy and taken in poor light. But there
were no takers, spokesmen for the other networks said Monday. The
quality wasn't good, said David Miller, NBC's foreign news editor:
``I thought it was shabby.''

   Bert Parks, who last sang ``There She
Is'' 11 years ago to Miss America, will return to perform in this
year's pageant, a spokeswoman for the event said Tuesday.
   His exact role will be announced at a news conference Wednesday
in New York, pageant spokeswoman Mary McGinnis said.
   Pageant director Leonard Horn previously said Parks was invited
to the pageant's 70th anniversary, with at least 26 former Miss
Americas returning. In response, Parks, 75, said he wanted to do
more than serenade the winner with his trademark song.
   A message left Tuesday at Parks' Greenwich, Conn., home was not
returned.
   Parks was fired in January 1980 after being host of the Miss
America Pageant for 25 years. Then-pageant director Albert Marks
Jr., who died last year, said Parks was too old at age 65 to
continue as host.
   The firing drew a nationwide protest, including a mail-in
campaign organized by Johnny Carson. But Parks later joked that the
firing was the best thing to happen to his career, because he got
other jobs, including host of the Mrs. America Pageant and the
national finals of a small dog contest.
   Gary Collins and Phyllis George are co-hosts of the pageant
again this year. Last year, Collins sang ``There She Is'' to the
winner.

   Curtis Mayfield, a rhythm and blues singer
popular in the 1960s and '70s, was seriously injured by a lighting
tower toppled by wind at an outdoor music festival.
   Mayfield, 48, was listed in critical but stable condition
Tuesday at Kings County Hospital with head and neck injuries. Three
stagehands and four concert volunteers also were hurt, police
spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Wrensen said.
   Mayfield was preparing to perform Monday night when a gust blew
over the lighting tower and some speakers.
   ``I had just introduced him to the crowd, and all of a sudden it
was like a tornado, the wind that came through,'' said state Sen.
Marty Markowitz.
   Chicago-born Mayfield started as a teen-age guitarist,
songwriter and occasional lead vocalist for The Impressions. His
hits included the civil rights song ``People Get Ready.''
   He left the group in 1970 and two years later wrote the music
for the film ``Superfly,'' including the song ``Freddie's Dead.''
He also wrote the soundtrack for the 1975 Bill Cosby-Sidney Poitier
film, ``Let's Do It Again.''

<HEAD>New Indictment Possible in Noriega Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors may ask for a new indictment in the
drug-trafficking case against Manuel Noriega, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. attorney's office confirmed Tuesday.
   ``The investigation is continuing,'' said Diane Cossin.
``Additional charges have been contemplated.''
   In recent court hearings for Noriega co-defendant Roberto
Steiner, prosecutors told U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff that the
new indictment would broaden the charges against the 16 defendants.
   A source close to the investigation told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity that the new case is not ready to present to
the grand jury, but Ms. Cossin refused to comment.
   Newsweek magazine reported this week that a separate Tampa
indictment accusing Noriega of marijuana smuggling may be folded
into the Miami case. The report said many consider the original
Miami charges weak. Ms. Cossin would say only that the case will be
tried in Miami.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said he had heard reports of a new
indictment.
   ``I'm mystified by the whole thing,'' he said. ``The government
doesn't need to bring a new indictment to bring new evidence in,
and they certainly don't need to bring new charges to keep Noriega
in jail for the rest of his life.''
   The only effect of a new indictment, he said, would be to
further delay the planned Jan. 28 start of the trial.
   The Miami indictment was issued in February 1988. It accuses
Noriega, who is being held at a federal prison outside the city, of
turning Panama into a way station for U.S.-bound cocaine in return
for $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   One co-defendant, William Saldarriaga, has pleaded guilty and
agreed to testify for the government.
   In addition, the government has been discussing a plea bargain
with Noriega aide Luis Del Cid, who accompanied the Panamanian
leader on top-level trips to Cuba and allegedly collected funds for
him. Those talks with Del Cid, however, have been held up by the
Panamanian government's refusal to drop charges in that country,
according to defense attorney Samuel Burstyn.
   In addition, co-defendant Amet Paredes, the son of former top
Panamanian official Gen. Ruben Dario Paredes, surrendered to U.S.
officials a month ago and was immediately released on bond despite
charges that could put him in prison for 95 years. Noriega defense
attorneys have claimed he also is bargaining with the government.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ships going to or coming from Iraq will be
allowed to transit the Suez Canal despite international sanctions
against Baghdad because of a 102-year-old treaty requiring free
passage, the government said Tuesday.
   Under the 1888 Constantinople Convention governing navigation
through the canal, ships can be denied transit only if they fly the
flag of a country at war with Egypt, Cairo officials say.
   President Hosni Mubarak cited the convention one week ago when
he rejected Iraqi demands that Egypt bar canal passage to U.S. and
other naval units sent to the Persian Gulf after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   ``The Constantinople Convention forbids passage only to ships
from countries at war with Egypt. Just like you look after your
interests, I look after mine,'' Mubarak advised Iraq at the time.
   The Constantinople Convention provides in its first article that
the canal ``will remain continuously free and open in time of peace
and also in time of war before all vessels, whether commercial or
military, without any discrimination.''
   Article 10, however, says provisions decreeing freedom of
passage shall not conflict with Cairo's need ``to defend Egypt and
maintain public security therein.''
   Egypt interprets this as meaning that it has the right to deny
passage to ships from countries at war with Egypt. It invoked the
article in denying transit to Israeli ships before the countries
signed a peace treaty in 1979.
   Although Egypt was not officially a belligerent in World War II,
British occupation forces in the canal zone closed the waterway to
ships from Nazi Germany and Italy. Article 10 apparently was their
justification.
   Egypt also normally bans passage of ships propelled by nuclear
power or carrying nuclear weapons. It says the rule is necessary
for the security of the waterway and the three major population
centers along its 100-mile stretch.
   But in recent years, Cairo has bent the no-nuclear rule on
several occasions to help the United States in emergency situations.
   Only last week, Mubarak allowed transit for the nuclear-powered
U.S. aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   The same exception was granted U.S. warships at least twice
during the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran and once, in 1986,
in connection with a crisis between the United States and Libya.
   Egypt has had a special relationship with the United States
since Washington brokered its peace treaty with Israel. Cairo has
received $2.1 billion annually in U.S. military and economic aid in
recent years.
   The state-run Middle East News Agency quoted a spokesman for the
Suez Canal Authority on Tuesday as saying that barring Iraqi or
Iraq-bound ships was neither possible legally nor practical.
   ``Those who ask Egypt to close the canal to Iraq-bound ships
should try to stop these ships at the points of origin, not in the
channel,'' he said.
   The spokesman added that even if the waterway were closed to
Iraq-bound vessels, ``These ships can simply change their
destinations to Aqaba (in Jordan) instead of to Iraq.''

<HEAD>Government Acknowledges Sending Checks to Deceased Veterans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Department of Veterans Affairs has paid
benefits to more than 1,200 deceased veterans, including about 100
dead a decade or more, the General Accounting Office says. The
agency pegs the potential annual loss due from the erroneous
payments at $5.7 million.
   Auditors for the congressional investigating agency said the
department could have reduced the erroneous payments by matching VA
benefit payment files with death information maintained by the
Social Security Administration.
   The department, agreeing with the GAO's findings, said it now
intends to follow that procedure.
   ``We found that in April 1989 VA paid compensation or benefit
payments for 1,212 veterans whom Social Security Administration
records reported had died at least four months earlier,'' the GAO
said in a report to the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
   ``About 100 had been dead 10 years or more.''
   The Veterans Affairs Department pays out more than $14.7 billion
a year in disability compensation and pension benefits to more than
2.8 million veterans and nearly 1 million surviving spouses and
other dependents.
   The GAO said that while benefits should be ended when a
beneficiary dies, ``if surviving relatives or other knowledgeable
persons do not report death to VA in a timely manner, substantial
erroneous payments can result.''
   The agency said the department has relied on voluntary reporting
of deaths as a basis for ending benefits.
   But investigators said the Social Security Administration goes
much further, receiving reports of deaths from many sources and
buying death certificate information from states.
   Federal agencies such as the VA are authorized to obtain this
information, the GAO said.
   The congressional agency said that by matching VA's benefit
payment file with Social Security files containing information on
39 million deaths ``we identified 1,212 veterans who were reported
dead as of December 1988.''
   The GAO said it first found 1,065 veterans that Social Security
data showed were dead but who were still receiving VA benefits.
   ``Erroneous payments to these veterans' accounts could amount to
$5.1 million annually,'' it said.
   The GAO said it then matched the VA payment file with a Social
Security file containing about 450,000 death certificates purchased
from the states.
   That search added an additional 147 deceased veterans whose bank
accounts were continuing to receive payments. The GAO said it
estimated these erroneous payments at $638,000.
   The review was conducted between August 1989 and April 1990.
   The Veterans Affairs Department, acting at the GAO's request,
investigated several of the cases, with these results:
   _A veteran, identified by Social Security as having died in
August 1984, continued to receive VA benefits. Records showed that
a total of $30,369 in direct deposits had been made to the
veteran's bank accounts. The VA ended benefit payments, concluded
that overpayments of $30,000 had been made and opened an
investigation.
   _Social Security records showed another veteran had died in
September 1983 but the department continued to make direct deposit
payments totaling $13,797. The payments were ended and the
department is considering further action.
   _Social Security records showed another veteran had died on Aug.
8, 1986. VA payments had been sent since then to the veteran's last
known address. The VA ended payments after determining that the
veteran was indeed dead and that a sister had been cashing his
checks. Erroneous payments were estimated at $2,755.
   In a letter to the GAO, Edward J. Derwinski, the secretary of
veterans affairs, said he concurred with the agency's findings and
was moving to obtain death information from the Social Security
Administration.
   ``Upon verification of the death, we will take prompt action to
stop any erroneous payment and to resolve any overpayment that
would develop,'' Derwinski's letter said.

<HEAD>More and More Women in Medical Schools; Minority Enrollment
Stagnant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Release at 4 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proportion of women in medical schools
continues to grow but the percentage of black and Hispanic
enrollments is largely stagnant, according to a report by the
American Medical Association.
   One medical school dean says that's a symptom of the ``lip
service'' that the nation has given to minority medical education.
   In the past 10 years, female enrollment at medical schools has
jumped from 16,315, or 25.4 percent, to 23,501, or 36.1 percent,
said a report in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   Minority medical enrollment has remained about level, with the
4,076 black medical students last year amounting to 6.3 of all
enrollees, and the 3,518 Hispanics making up 5.5 percent of medical
students, the report said.
   A decade ago, total black enrollment was 3,708, or 5.5 percent,
the AMA said. In 1979, the closest year for which comparable
figures are available, Hispanic enrollment was 2,289, or 3.7
percent, it said.
   ``Since the early 1970s, there has been a national commitment to
expand the opportunities for members of minority groups to enter
medicine and other health professions,'' said the first report,
headed by Dr. Harry S. Jonas, director of the AMA's Divison of
Undergraduate Medical Education.
   ``Despite this commitment, the percentage of black and Hispanic
applicants and matriculants has not shown a significant rise.''
   William Wallace, associate dean of the University of Illinois
School of Medicine at Chicago, disagreed with that assessment.
   ``I don't think there has been a national commitment (to recruit
minority medical students),'' said Wallace, whose school has one of
the largest minority enrollments in the country. ``The commitment
has been more lip service than a national commitment.''
   For example, the federal government is giving the University of
Illinois' medical school less money this year than last for
minority recruitment, or a total of $140,000, he said.
   The high cost of medical education may be one factor
discouraging potential minority applicants, another report in the
Journal said.
   The average debt for medical students who borrowed money was
$42,374 at graduation in 1989, up more than $4,000 from only a year
earlier. Four of five graduates were in debt.
   For minorities, the debt burden averaged about $6,000 higher,
said researchers led by Paul Jolly of the Association of American
Medical Colleges in Washington.

   A powerful car bomb exploded next to the
Government Palace as President Alberto Fujimori was meeting with
advisers, injuring four passersby, police said Tuesday.
   Other car bombs exploded in the highland cities of Cuzco and
Ayacucho, killing one person, police said. The attacks ended a lull
in political violence since Fujimori took office July 28.
   The car bomb attack against the palace late Monday shattered
windows in the residential area of the building. The blast also
blew a 3-foot-wide crater in the sidewalk and knocked chunks of
concrete from the wall.
   Police blamed the attack on the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement. They said the car contained 22 pounds of
dynamite.
   Army troops and police sealed off the streets around the palace
and the Plaza de Armas facing the building after the attack.
   One man died and at least 17 people were wounded in the blast in
Cuzco, a tourist center in Peru's Andean mountains 350 miles
southeast of Lima, police said.
   The bomb exploded Monday in front of an army barracks, one block
from a leading tourist hotel. No tourists were hurt in the
explosion though four soldiers were among the wounded, police said.
   Police said the attack was probably carried out by the Maoist
Shining Path rebel movement.
   The Shining Path exploded 22 pounds of dynamite before dawn
Tuesday in a car in the center of Ayacucho, a highland city 230
miles southeast of Lima, police said.
   No one was injured in the blast, which broke windows and damaged
buildings. Two other bombs exploded in Ayacucho earlier Tuesday,
police said.
   Shining Path rebels also killed three village officials near
Huaraz, police said. Huaraz, 175 miles north of Lima, is a popular
destination of mountain climbers.
   The rebels staged a trial of the three men in the plaza of a
small village and then killed them each with a shot to the head.
   More than 19,000 people have died in political violence in Peru
the past 10 years.

   Two candidates battled for the Democratic U.S.
Senate nomination Tuesday in the Colorado primary election and
voters in metropolitan Denver were asked to approve financing for a
major league baseball stadium.
   An estimated 1.8 million voters were eligible to cast ballots in
the primary, but Secretary of State Natalie Meyer expected only
about 630,000 to turn out, or about 35 percent.
   In the Senate primary, Josie Heath had about a 2-to-1 lead in
polls over Carlos Lucero in their race for the seat now held by
Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Armstrong, who did not seek re-election.
   Recent polls showed voters in six Denver-area counties nearly
even on whether to approve a 12-year, 0.1 percent sales tax _ one
cent on each $10 purchase _ that would raise $139 million for a new
stadium.
   In the 4th Congressional District, two state senators, Wayne
Allard of Loveland and Jim Brandon of Akron, faced each other in a
runoff for the Republican nomination.
   Republicans also faced a decision in the attorney general's race
between Richard ``Mac'' McManus and Gale Norton, with the winner to
face Democratic incumbent Duane Woodard in November. Woodard was
unopposed Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Incumbent Gov. Roy Romer had no Democratic primary opposition
and neither did his Republican opponent, John Andrews.
   Heath, 52, of Boulder, whose only political experience was as a
Boulder County commissioner, picked up strong party support during
the precinct caucuses last spring, forcing former state Democratic
Chairman Buie Seawell out of the race.
   She captured the top line on the primary ballot at the
Democratic State Assembly in June, leading Lucero by a 2-to-1
margin and kept ahead of him in the polls right up until the
election.
   Lucero, 49, an Alamosa lawyer, kept his hopes of winning the
nomination alive chiefly by mounting a relentless attack on the
savings and loan scandal, particularly on Denver's Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan.
   Lucero had what appeared to be little party support and hardly
any money. He entered politics in 1984, losing to then-Lt. Gov.
Nancy Dick in a Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate.
   The winner will meet GOP nominee Hank Brown, who faced no
opposition Tuesday. Most polls have shown Brown would easily beat
the Democratic primary winner in the November general election.
   Allard and Brandon were vying for the right to succeed Brown in
the 4th District. The Democratic nominee, state Rep. Richard Bond
of Greeley, was unopposed.
   The proposed baseball stadium tax would not be imposed unless
Denver is awarded a National League expansion franchise. The city
is bidding for one of two baseball franchises to be awarded this
year. Baseball proponents hope approval of the tax will lure a team.

   President Bush broke off his
vacation today to return to the White House for budget and military
briefings after agreeing to meet here Thursday with Jordan's King
Hussein.
   Bush himself was sticking with plans to spend less than 24 hours
in Washington, returning to his oceanfront compound here on Maine's
rocky coast in mid-afternoon Wednesday.
   But the president kept up his frenetic diplomatic efforts by
telephone, calling Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu Monday
night and taking a call from King Hussein, just back from
conferring with Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.
   King Hussein asked for a meeting ``to discuss the matter
directly with the president,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said today. ``The president agreed and phoned the king
back a short time later to confirm the arrangements.''
   Fitzwater said there was ``no indication'' the king is carrying
a message from Saddam, but senior Jordanian officials in Amman said
the king was carrying a letter from the Iraqi leader.
   Bush instructed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to head back to
Saudi Arabia on Friday to visit American troops mustered in the
desert and confer again with King Fahd.
   Bush himself planned to spend the afternoon at the White House
reviewing budgetary problems with aides, facing reporters and then
meeting with Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheikh Saud-Al-Sabah.
   While the White House initially said the budget session would
include both Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and budget
director Richard Darman, neither planned to attend. They were
sending deputies in their stead.
   Brady was on a speaking trip for Republican candidates in the
Midwest. Darman's office refused to say where he was.
   After spending the night in the White House, Bush will be driven
to the Pentagon Wednesday morning for a full-scale military
briefing on the situation in the Gulf. He also will speak to
Pentagon workers in the courtyard of the huge military complex
before taking a helicopter to Andrews Air Force Base and the return
flight to his summer home.
   Bush got in a morning of fishing with his wife, Barbara, before
returning to Washington.
   The White House said Monday it was ``very optimistic ... that
the embargo will hold,'' cutting off not only Iraq's exports of
oil, but also denying it food and other goods.
   ``The nations of the world are abiding by their commitments,''
said Fitzwater. The naval barricade forced ``two or three ships''
to turn back at sea without reaching Iraqi ports, he added.
   The White House said the gulf crisis has added new urgency to
the quest for a bipartisan agreement to reduce the gaping federal
deficit.
   ``We think it's even more important that we reach an agreement
now because there needs to be a unity of purpose in this country,
not only about the conflict in the gulf, but also about our
spending issues and about where the budget is going,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Bush stayed out of the public eye Monday, calling Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez to discuss the crisis and world oil
supplies, and relaxing by taking his high-speed boat Fidelity out
on fishing runs in the Atlantic.
   In Tokyo, Foreign Ministry officials said Bush asked Kaifu that
Japan boost its aid to Middle East countries hurt by the embargo on
trade with Iraq. The ministry did not specify which nations might
be involved, but Egypt, Jordan and Turkey are among Japanese aid
recipients affected by the increased tensions.
   Fitzwater declined to reveal what the two leaders talked about.
   Bush plans to return to Maine by mid-afternoon Wednesday after
his military briefing and a speech to Pentagon employees. But he
may do more shuttling back to Washington before his crisis-clouded
vacation ends on Sept. 3.

<HEAD>Ortega Says His Life After Electoral Defeat Is `Rich'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel Ortega says he doesn't miss being
president of Nicaragua and is enjoying his new role as a leader of
the political opposition.
   Ortega, who was defeated in elections Feb. 25 after ruling his
Central American nation for 10 years, said in an interview Tuesday
that his Sandinista National Liberation Front was revamping itself
to appeal to a broader range of Nicaraguan voters.
   The Sandinistas this month began holding ``public debates'' in
Nicaragua for people to tell Sandinista leaders what they did wrong
and what they did right during their rule, Ortega said.
   ``The door is open for everyone to talk,'' the former president
said.
   The criticism will lead to a reformation of the party's policies
and objectives, with an eye on the country's next elections, in
1996, Ortega said.
   He said it was too early to tell if he will be the Sandinista's
presidential candidate.
   Ortega came to New York this week to maintain ties with
supporters here _ he gave a speech in a church Monday night to
2,500 people _ and to contact publishers for a book he plans to
write.
   The book might be a work of fiction based on fact, he said,
drawing on his own experiences.
   Ortega acknowledges that the Sandinistas committed several
errors, which sent many Nicaraguans over to the side of
U.S.-supported Contra rebels who fought for almost a decade to
overthrow the leftist government, at a cost of some 40,000 lives.
   In the days after the Sandinistas toppled Anastasio Somoza in
July 1979, the dictator's supporters, the Somocistas, were targeted
to have their large land holdings redistributed to the poor.
   ``Some landowners were affected who weren't precisely
Somocistas,'' Ortega acknowledged.
   ``The urgent demand for land made us act in a hasty way, giving
a very negative impression to rural people,'' he said. ``This gave
the Contras the opportunity to say the Sandinistas want to take
land away from everyone.''
   Ortega said the Sandinistas also mistreated the Miskito Indians,
who opposed the government and were forcibly removed from their
homelands in northeastern Nicaragua in the early 1980s. The Miskito
and other Indian tribes joined the Contra's armed resistance to
Sandinista rule, largely because of the relocation program.
   Ortega appeared relaxed during the 45-minute interview,
conducted in Spanish at the apartment of a friend of his former
foreign minister, Miguel D'Escoto, who also came on the trip to the
New York.
   The apartment on New York's exclusive Upper East Side, decorated
with a Picasso and other priceless artworks, seemed an incongruous
setting for the former revolutionary.
   Ortega, who robbed banks in his early teens to get money for the
anti-Somoza insurrection, wore a blue blazer and necktie.
   ``It's unprecedented for a revolutionary who fought a
dictatorship with weapons to later win power and then become the
opposition ... within a democratic context that he himself helped
create,'' he said. ``So I think this is a rich experience.''
   The Sandinistas have organized two strikes since President
Violeta Chamorro was inaugurated April 25, imperiling her new
government and raising fears that the Sandinistas would try to
wrest power away from her.
   Ortega said the Sandinistas will not use forcible means. ``If we
are going to return to running the government of Nicaragua, it will
be through elections.''

   With no Iraqis in sight, the biggest problem
for American troops deployed in the desert sands is the 115-degree
heat.
   Soldiers in full battle dress added a chic touch to their gear _
liter bottles of mineral water. The U.S. forces were told to drink
at least six gallons of water a day.
   One medic said Tuesday he had treated numerous dehydration
cases, some requiring intravenous injections of nutrient-rich
fluids.
   Troops at a staging camp said the heat had ``fried'' some
radios, rendering them useless.
   Even reporters _ members of the Pentagon-organized news pool _
had to wear long pants. The Saudis frown on shorts.
   Perhaps such hardships are just as well.
   ``They could put us up in air-conditioned buildings,'' said a
24-year-old medic from Hollywood, Fla. ``But then, if we have to
fight people used to this, we're not going to last very long.
   ``I'm like their mother,'' the medic told Peter Copeland, a
reporter for Scripps Howard News Service. ``It's my job to see that
they eat, and if you see a guy with two full canteens, you know
he's not drinking.''
   As the American buildup continued, U.S. forces took up positions
side-by-side with Saudi marines at a Saudi naval base near vital
oil terminals.
   Transport planes continued landing U.S. troops and materiel at
an air base elsewhere in the country. A British Airways jet was
also seen arriving. Already lined up at the airport were dozens of
Saudi fighter jets and a smaller contingent of Canadian fighters.
   U.S. bulldozers, front-end loaders, armored vehicles and jeeps
lined the base roads. Pallet after pallet of munitions, gear, food
and other supplies were stacked along the roads.
   In all, the American reporters visited with members of the 82nd
Airborne at three sites _ the naval base, the air base and a nearby
air-defense camp that the Saudis have given over to the Americans.
   Ground rules for the pool prohibit the release of exact numbers
of weapons, exact locations of U.S. deployments and the names of
most troops here. Only officers with command duties can be quoted
by name.
   Tuesday's tour gave the pool reporters their first chance to see
U.S. troops in the field with Saudi forces.
   At the naval base, the 82nd was working to secure the area for
Marines, who began arriving in Saudi Arabia Monday.
   While at the base, two lengthy convoys of double-decker buses
carrying U.S. troops passed along a nearby highway to a barracks
area of the sprawling base.
   A small detachment from the 82nd took up positions on sand dunes
overlooking the water. Nearby were Saudi forces from the naval base.
   The air defense camp bristled with Vietnam-era M551 Sheridan
airborne-assault vehicles _ light tanks that can be air-dropped.
Also at the site was a multiple rocket launcher.
   As the troop presence intensifies, many foreign civilians are
leaving the area.
   Cmdr. Christopher J. Elles, who heads a 20-member U.S. Navy
training detachment in Saudi Arabia, said 10,000 foreign nationals,
including about 2,000 Americans, had left the city where he is
stationed since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Many of those are relatives of oil workers who have stayed
behind.
   Asked about the defenses in place at the oil facilities, Elles
said, ``One bomb in the right place obviously would create a lot of
problems.'' He added, ``That's a personal opinion.''
   With the exception of the Canadian jets, the reporters have not
seen forces from any other nations. Diplomatic sources in Riyadh,
the capital, said Syrian units landed Tuesday to join U.S.,
British, Egyptian and other forces.
   ``There's a great deal of working relationships that have to be
worked out,'' Elles said of the growing multinational defense force.
   One of those relationships involves respect for the Saudis'
Islamic faith.
   At one spot on the naval base, Americans and Saudis are housed
in tents about 50 yards apart.
   Between the tents, Copeland's report said, is an area with two
25-foot-long pieces of canvas. The Saudis asked the Americans not
to step there because that is where they face Mecca and pray five
times daily.
   How do the two tents communicate?
   A 26-year-old Saudi sergeant had this answer, delivered through
an interpreter:
   ``Some of us speak a little English. Or we use Arabic. But,
mostly, it's sign language.''
   And what do they talk about?
   ``Whatever comes to mind,'' the sergeant said.
   Often, the talk is about the heat.
   The Saudi sergeant, sweat running down his face into a thick,
black beard, said of his American counterparts, ``God willing, they
will get used to the heat soon.''
   His advice to the Yanks:
   ``Keep the flaps of your tent open.''

   Truckloads of goods rolled into Iraq from
Jordan and Iraqi-bound cargo was unloaded from ships at the
southern port of Aqaba on Tuesday, despite U.N.-ordered sanctions
against Baghdad.
   King Hussein flew to Washington on Tuesday for talks with
President Bush, still refusing to sever what could become Iraq's
economic lifeline. The king departed carrying a message to Bush
from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, with whom he met Monday.
   This indicated Hussein is still hoping for a diplomatic solution
to the crisis caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Hussein's refusal to comply with the embargo against Iraqi goods
stems from the impact this would have on Jordan's fragile economy
and the expected violent reaction from the largely pro-Iraqi
Jordanians.
   Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Mutasem Belbeisi explained that
though the U.N. sanctions are mandatory, ``every country whose
economy can be severely affected can consult with the Security
Council to see what measures could be adopted and what sanctions
could be imposed, if any.''
   Western diplomats said the Jordanian delegation to the United
Nations was discussing this point in New York.
   The imposition of sanctions by Jordan would block 40 percent of
the country's total exports and raise Jordan's 16 percent
unemployment rate by 10 percent to 12 percent, Jordanian officials
say.
   In addition, Jordan imports 90 percent of its domestic oil needs
from Iraq.
   In Israel, meanwhile, parliamentarian Binyamin Ben-Eliezer
demanded Tuesday that Israel impose a blockade on the Jordanian
port of Aqaba, where Iraq-bound supplies were being unloaded.
   The southern port is the last opening for goods to reach Iraq if
Western vessels completely seal the Persian Gulf. Its closure could
have a severe impact on Iraq, which is heavily dependent on
imported foodstuffs and other goods.
   Associated Press photographer Martin Cleaver said three ships
docked in the port Tuesday and were unloading. Norwegian newspapers
reported that police in Aqaba ordered a Norwegian ship to unload
corn bound for Iraq after the captain stopped deliveries.
   Cleaver said one of the ships was the Tanga, from Norway. He
could not confirm that police had ordered it to be unloaded.
Photographers were unable to approach the Tanga, which was heavily
guarded by Jordanian troops.
   Numerous loaded trucks were driving north from Aqaba toward
Amman and the Iraqi border. It was unclear which of the cargoes
were destined for Iraq.
   AP photographer Yousef Allan reported from the Ruweishid border
post, on the main highway linking Jordan with Iraq, that the volume
of heavy trucks and oil tankers traveling both ways had increased
over the past few days.
   Officials at the Ministry of Commerce said oil also continued to
flow out of Iraq through a small pipeline to a point near Amman. It
is Iraq's last operating oil pipeline, since Saudi Arabia and
Turkey have stopped shipments of Iraqi oil transported through
pipelines on their territory.
   Jordanian Commerce Ministry officials said apart from Jordanian
domestic needs, the operating pipeline is only used to transport
$50 million worth of oil annually to Brazil.
   In the Persian Gulf, U.S. and British warships have reportedly
started checking for shipping bound for Iraqi ports, Western
diplomats said.
   The diplomats said if Jordan continued to serve as a transit
point for Iraqi goods it could harm the multinational barricade.
But they said it was unlikely U.S. warships would intervene in the
Gulf of Aqaba to stop and check shipping.
   King Hussein is eager to act as an intermediary in what he has
described as ``the impossible job'' of settling the Kuwait crisis
peacefully through Arab mediation. He flew to Baghdad on Monday for
consultations with the Iraqi leader.
   The official Jordanian news agency, Petra, did not announce his
trip until after the king returned home Tuesday. Petra said the
king also talked by telephone to the leaders of Yemen, Tunisia,
Sudan and the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Israeli officials on Tuesday urged neighboring
Jordan to join the international embargo against Iraq, but Defense
Minister Moshe Arens said Israel would not take action if Jordan
ignored the pleas.
   ``There is no reason for us to interfere,'' Arens told Israel
radio. ``Israel is not part of the sea embargo declared by the
United States. This is being carried out with American ships and
European ships ... We are not part of this.''
   His remarks were in line with Israel's stated policy not to
become directly involved in the current crisis. However, Israel has
repeatedly said that if neighboring Jordan allowed the Iraqi army
to use Jordanian territory, it would attack.
   Washington has been careful not to enlist Israel, its closest
ally in the region, for fear such a move would anger Arab states
now backing the West.
   International attention is increasingly focusing on Jordan and
its Red Sea port of Aqaba, the last opening for goods to reach Iraq
if the Persian Gulf is sealed. Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, deputy head of
the Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, demanded
Tuesday that Israel impose a blockade on Aqaba.
   U.S. media reports said an Iraqi freighter carrying weapons was
en route to Aqaba, which is on the Jordanian-Israeli border and
only five miles from the Israeli resort of Elat.
   Three ships docked in the port Tuesday and were unloading,
according to Associated Press photographer Martin Cleaver. In
addition, numerous loaded trucks were driving north from Aqaba
toward Amman and the Iraqi border. It was unclear which of the
cargoes were destined for Iraq.
   An Israeli government official urged Jordan to end ``its very
hesitant policy'' toward Iraq.
   ``We hope that Jordan will join the international consensus and
join the embargo,'' said the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He said Aqaba would play a central role in the American showdown
with Iraq. ``Aqaba will be of major importance for Iraq's ability
to survive,'' he said.
   Other government officials said they were watching traffic in
the Gulf of Aqaba very closely and had not noticed any substantial
increase. Shish Dekel, the captain of an Israeli yacht moored in
Elat, also said traffic in Aqaba port appeared to be normal.
   Dekel, speaking on Israel radio, said that at the height of the
Iran-Iraq war, when Iraq did not have access to Persian Gulf ports,
as many as 90 ships with cargo for Iraq would pass through Aqaba
every day.
   During those days, Jordan built an elaborate road system to
truck goods from Aqaba to Iraq, Israeli military analysts said.
   The analysts said Jordan might seek to sidestep pressures from
both Iraq and the West by trying to get away with a partial embargo.
   ``On the one hand, they fear being portrayed as joining the
great powers against Iraq. On the other hand, they don't want to be
seen as anti-American,'' said Asher Susser, head of the Dayan
Center, a think tank at Tel Aviv University.
   Susser said if Jordan's King Hussein goes along with a full
embargo, it would probably cause domestic upheaval. Jordan has
witnessed mass pro-Iraqi demonstrations by Palestinians and Moslem
fundamentalists.
   But another analyst, Dore Gold, said the United States probably
would not allow goods to reach Iraq via Aqaba because it would
damage the effectiveness of international sanctions.
   ``If there is any sense that the blockade, or let's use the word
quarantine, is porous to a certain extent, then immediately nations
with greater mercantile interests will start trading with Iraq,''
said Gold, an analyst at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at
Tel Aviv University.

<HEAD>Pan-German Abortion Debate Intensifies As Unity Nears</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A searing debate on abortion got
hotter Tuesday when a leading lawmaker insisted West German women
be barred from taking advantage of East Germany's liberal abortion
law after unification.
   ``Abortion tourism (to East Germany) would be unleashed if there
were no threat of punishment,'' said Wolfgang Boetsch, a
high-ranking member of a conservative party that is part of West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government.
   Sentiments on the issue are so divided that last month the two
nations postponed deciding on a united Germany's abortion statutes
until an all-German parliament can take up the matter.
   When unity occurs by the end of the year, two abortion laws will
exist in one nation _ West Germany's strict statute, and the far
more lenient one in what is now East Germany.
   In West Germany, abortions are allowed only if there is a
life-threatening risk to the mother, if the pregnancy resulted from
rape or incest, or if birth would create extraordinary social and
economic hardship.
   East German women, on the other hand, have a fundamental legal
right to an abortion, as long as it occurs within the first 12
weeks of pregnancy.
   East Germany, with a population of about 16 million, last year
recorded 73,000 abortions. The figure was 75,297 in West Germany,
which has a population about four times greater than its eastern
neighbor.
   East Germany has insisted that its abortion law be retained
after unification.
   The debate is not only between two nations, but also between
political partners.
   The liberal Free Democrats, junior coalition partners in Kohl's
government, have proposed not to prosecute West German women if
they choose to travel to what is now East Germany for abortions
after unification.
   That idea has enraged the conservative Christian Social Union.
   ``The CSU will not abide by such a step,'' Boetsch said Tuesday.
``Reversing the state's protection for the unborn life is out of
the question (for West Germans), under any circumstances.''
   Liberal politicians have said that if West Germany retains its
abortion laws, a West German woman who had an abortion in an East
German clinic could face prosecution on her return home.
   East German doctors say West German women have already begun
crossing the border to benefit from East Germany's abortion laws.
   But East German doctors are not permitted to perform abortions
on foreigners. So far, there have been no reports of East German
doctors violating the law.
   Parliament President Rita Suessmuth, a top Kohl ally, has
ruffled a few conservative feathers by lambasting the West German
law.
   ``If men were those people who were primarily affected, they
would have made a humane as well as life-protecting law long ago,''
Ms. Suessmuth said earlier this month.
   Kohl has stayed clear of the fight. But his Christian Democrats
have insisted that West Germany's abortion law should serve as the
model for that of a united Germany.
   Ms. Suessmuth has tried to calm the waters by proposing a
compromise law for a united Germany.
   Her idea is to meld the intensive consultations required under
West German law with a woman's basic right to an abortion within
the first trimester.
   For many conservatives, however, that sounds too much like the
current East German law.

   The Pentagon said Tuesday that additional Air
Force aircraft and Marines had arrived in Saudi Arabia to
participate in the military buildup code-named Desert Shield.
   An announcement said an unspecified number of KC-10 and KC-135
tanker aircraft and RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft, as well as
Airborne Warning and Control System radar planes had arrived for
the Saudi operation.
   In line with Pentagon practice during the buildup of forces in
the Saudi desert, no details were provided on numbers of aircraft
or troops arriving in the gulf, nor their exact locations.
   The announcement said advance elements of the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Force from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and the 7th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade, from Twenty-nine Palms., Calif., had arrived
in Saudi Arabia.
   Also, other elements of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force have
begun deploying to the gulf area from California, it said. The
Marine group includes elements of the 1st Marine Division and the
1st Force Service Support Group from Camp Pendleton, and the 3rd
Marine Aircraft Wing from El Toro, Calif.
   A Marine expeditionary force usually totals about 50,000
personnel, but the Pentagon has declined to specify the size of the
unit deploying to Saudi Arabia.
   The Pentagon also said elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary
Brigade, headquartered at Norfolk, Va., are deploying to Saudi
Arabia. The brigade includes units from the 2nd Marine Division and
the 2nd Force Service Support Group of Camp Lejeune, N.C., and the
2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Cherry Point and New River, N.C., the
announcement said.

<TEXT>
   About 10,000 radical students rallied
Tuesday to demand the immediate unification of the divided Korean
peninsula and vowed to march to the heavily fortified border to
press for free travel to North Korea.
   The students, gathered at Seoul's Yonsei University, said they
would begin the 35-mile march to the border Wednesday, the 45th
anniversary of Korea's liberation from 35 years of Japanese
colonial rule.
   A mass unification rally was scheduled to be held with North
Korea at the border village of Panmunjom on Wednesday.
   Before Tuesday's rally, 79 radical students and dissidents were
arrested at the sprawling U.S. 8th Army headquarters in central
Seoul, five of them for ramming a car through the main gate.
   The car, carrying dissidents and a student radical shouting
``Drive out Yankees!'' smashed through the military headquarters'
main gate and was stopped about 30 yards inside the facility.
   At the rally at Yonsei, students chanted anti-American and
pro-unification slogans.
   ``Let's drive out the Yankees who block unification of the
fatherland!'' they shouted. ``Free travel, total border opening!''
   The students are demanding the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea, saying their presence hinders
dialogue with communist North Korea on unification.
   The students also cut rolls of barbed wire to symbolize hopes
for an end to the division of the Koreas.
   Student leaders said thousands of people would march to attend
the unification rally at Panmunjom. ``Let's go North,'' chanted the
students.
   Under a South Korean proposal, the heavily armed border was to
have opened for unrestricted travel to North Korea for five days
beginning on Monday. But both sides failed to agree on procedures.
   More than 61,000 South Koreans applied to visit the North during
the proposed trial border opening.
   The government's Unification Ministry charged North Korea with
blocking the first proposed free travel between citizens of the
divided peninsula and urged the North to open its border.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the
peninsula in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early 1950s.
The border is heavily fortified and there is no mail or other forms
of regular communication between the two sides.
   In North Korea, 1,000 people, including Koreans from overseas
and from the South, attended ceremonies Monday as a prelude to the
Wednesday unification rally, the official North Korean news agency
said.

<HEAD>96 Dogs Eye Broadway Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dogs spoke, sat and stayed, and a few had little
accidents, as 96 canines auditioned Tuesday for the role of Asta in
the Broadway musical ``Nick and Nora.''
   ``Isn't it a riot?'' said Denise Lee of New York, who brought
4-year-old Hector, a wirehair terrier, to the Roseland ballroom in
Manhattan. ``He's thinking `Dogs, dogs, dogs!' ''
   When Ms. Lee, an actress, commanded Hector to ``speak'' onstage,
a canine chorus obliged from the audience.
   The owners all hoped their dogs would play the sidekick to
sleuths Nick and Nora Charles in a musical based on the Dashiell
Hammett novel ``The Thin Man,'' which also served for several films.
   The musical is to open in February.
   There was an occasional beagle or Dalmatian, but most of the
would-be stage dogs were terriers, like the dog in the movie.
   ``Her name is Asta, but nobody believes us,'' said Jesse
Eisenberg, 12{, of Ridgewood, N.J., who showed off his 2{-year-old
wirehair terrier.
   ``She has no stage experience, but she's very personable,'' he
said. ``She's a little scared today. But she would get over it
eventually.''
   A pianist played show tunes while the owners presented their
dogs onstage. When a dog had the right look, trainer Warren
Eckstein commanded it to lie down, sit, heel and stay. Some got the
ultimate test: sitting still while being tempted with a favorite
toy.
   Some dogs trembled, but remembered their manners. Others bolted;
employees knelt in the wings to catch runaways.
   ``They get a little energized,'' said Brig Berney, an assistant
to the producers, who darted around the ballroom with a roll of
paper towels.
   Sammy, a 3{-year-old cairn terrier, had played Toto in a
Westchester County production of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' His audition
won applause.
   ``He asked us to bring him here today. He said the part was made
for him,'' said his owner, Karen DiMargo of Carmel, an obedience
instructor.
   ``People want their dog to be a star,'' said co-producer James
Pentecost, who lamented: ``I'm a cat person. I'm allergic to dogs.''

   There was no rocket's red glare, no
bombs bursting in air. But our flag was still there Tuesday at a
surf shop where officials backed off ticketing the owner for flying
Old Glory.
   It only took hours for Mayor Fred Lager _ perhaps thinking about
what happened to Roseanne Barr _ to rescind the ticket, citing a
misinterpretation of a local law.
   Atlantic Beach Surf Shop owner Tom Sena has been flying the flag
outside his Long Island store since he opened it five years ago.
But on Monday Inspector Frank LeVecchi gave him a $250 ticket for
violating a 1976 ordinance barring ``hanging, exhibiting and
swinging of banners and flags without the written permission of
Atlantic Beach's board of Trustees.''
   Lager said the law was meant to keep shop owners from flying
several flags, particularly in commercial displays. The mayor said
LeVecchi apologized and that the town might consider changing the
flag law's language.

<HEAD>Syria Joins `Desert Shield'; Middleman King Heads for U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syrian troops planted their flag beside the American in the
defense of Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, and Arab harbormasters in the
Persian Gulf kept embargoed Iraqi freighters at bay, turning up the
heat in the simmering showdown with Baghdad.
   In Washington, the U.S. and Soviet superpowers conferred on
putting a United Nations umbrella over any anti-Iraq naval blockade.
   The new middleman of the Middle East, Jordan's King Hussein,
headed for the United States and a meeting with President Bush,
carrying with him a private message from Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   As peace efforts and economic pressure stepped up, U.S. military
forces continued to pour across a 7,000-mile air bridge into the
Arabian desert. It was the seventh day of ``Desert Shield,'' the
operation designed to face down an Iraqi army that seized Kuwait
and could threaten Saudi Arabia.
   Out in the sand wastes, paratroopers of the U.S. Army's 82nd
Airborne Division found friendly Saudis and some tastes of home,
like a delivery of fast-food burgers, according to reports from
journalists in a U.S. media pool.
   But the young Americans also had to deal with 115-degree heat
and the potential for chemical warfare with Iraq.
   Said one GI, ``We're trained and ready.''
   North across the desert, hundreds of other Americans remained
trapped in Kuwait and Iraq.
   One Iraqi spokesman, the ambassador to Greece, told reporters in
Athens the Americans and thousands of other foreigners stranded
when Iraq invaded Kuwait could leave ``as soon as the threats from
the United States and its allies are eliminated.''
   The Voice of America radio, in a message beamed toward the
troubled upper gulf, cautioned the trapped Americans _ an estimated
2,500 in Kuwait and 500 to 600 in Iraq _ not to try to flee across
the Kuwait border into Saudi Arabia, ``due to the danger involved.''
   Under all the pressure, Iraq sounded unyielding.
   In Baghdad, the state-run newspaper Al-Jumhuriya said Iraq knows
how to ``foil'' U.S. measures. If Iraq is attacked, it said, Iraq
can ``move the battlefield to where (the United States) does not
want or expect it to be.''
   Iraq said it launched its lightning strike against Kuwait Aug. 2
because of disputes over oil and money: It said Kuwait deliberately
cut Iraqi oil revenues by overproducing its own oil and driving
down prices, and unfairly pressed for repayment of an estimated $15
billion in Kuwaiti loans to Iraq. The Iraqis also cited old claims
on Kuwaiti territory.
   After its conquest, Iraq announced the ``annexation'' of Kuwait.
To underline that declaration, the Baghdad government this week
began referring to Kuwait city as a ``southern Iraqi city.''
   At U.S. urging, the U.N. Security Council on Aug. 6 ordered a
worldwide punitive embargo on trade with Iraq. Bush then dispatched
U.S. troops and warplanes to Saudi Arabia, saying the massing of
Iraqi troops just across the border in Kuwait threatened
U.S.-aligned Saudi Arabia, U.S. oil supplies and, ultimately, the
U.S. economy. On Aug. 10, twelve of 20 Arab League nations voted to
also send their troops to stand beside the Saudis.
   The latest Arab contingent, from Syria, began arriving in Saudi
Arabia in the early morning Tuesday, said diplomatic sources in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh. No details were available on the size or
kind of unit involved.
   Most of an estimated 5,000 Egyptian troops promised for the
Saudi defense were already there, and Moroccan troops are expected
soon.
   A total of at least 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to be
committed to Desert Shield within weeks, including Marines, Army
air assault forces, paratroopers and infantry. At times in recent
days, U.S. air transports were landing every 10 minutes in Saudi
Arabia with American soldiers and supplies.
   Facing them were an estimated 200,000 Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
   Out in the warm aquamarine waters of the gulf, meanwhile, there
was new evidence Tuesday of the effectivness of the maritime
embargo.
   Authorities in the United Arab Emirates refused permission for
an Iraqi freighter, despite repeated appeals from the captain, to
enter the port of Dubai. The freighter, Al-Abid, stood anchored
uselessly three miles outside the Dubai breakwater, shipping
sources said. Another Iraqi freighter, Al-Baya, also waited
futilely off Dubai, the sources said.
   The international embargo could cripple Iraq by cutting off its
all-important trade _ exports of oil and imports of food and
military supplies.
   The sanctions are beginning to bite in Baghdad, said a Yugoslav
businessman who reached Belgrade on Tuesday. ``We noticed that
availability of foodstuffs ... has been reduced, and sugar and
flour are ... in short supply,'' he said.
   The Bush administration has made clear that dozens of U.S. Navy
ships assembling in the gulf region would be used to blockade Iraqi
maritime traffic if necessary. But U.S. allies and other U.N.
members object that the Security Council embargo resolution did not
specifically authorize such a naval operation.
   In an effort to reach an understanding, the State Department on
Tuesday summoned the Washington ambassadors of the four other
Security Council powers _ the Soviet Union, Britain, France and
China _ to discuss the possibility of establishing a joint U.N.
military command in the region, or of flying the U.N. flag on the
warships in the gulf.
   The Soviets, who have a handful of warships in the area, have
said they will not take part in a naval blockade except under
Security Council auspices.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, diplomats said the Security
Council was unlikely to act until after it hears reports Friday on
how the 159 U.N. members are observing the embargo.
   The boycott against Iraq was far from solid, particularly in
neighboring Jordan.
   Iraq-bound cargo was still being landed at the Jordanian port of
Aqaba, off the Red Sea, and eyewitnesses reported truck traffic
continued normally across the Iraq-Jordan border.
   Iraq's major oil outlets, pipelines through Turkey and Saudi
Arabia, were effectively shut down. But a smaller line into Jordan
remained operating, Jordanian officials said, and Iraqi oil was
being loaded into tanker trucks and sped to ships at Aqaba.

<HEAD>Army's Order for Desert-Bound Troops: 5,550 Bottles of Suntan
Lotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The local K mart whipped up a custom-made
blue-light special when the Army called with an order for special
supplies to equip Fort Stewart soldiers heading to the Middle East.
   K mart manager Wesley Bennefield said Tuesday he agreed to fill
the order at no profit: 5,550 bottles of suntan lotion, 2,400 cans
of bug spray, 5,550 bottles of skin lotion, 5,550 tubes of lip
balm, 5,550 containers of foot powder and 174,000 gallons of
bottled water.
   Bennefield said the Army called Friday and he was able to
deliver most of the items to the post Sunday night. Fort Stewart
began sending troops and equipment to Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
   ``This has been a real treat,'' Bennefield said. ``I've learned
one thing about the military: They're hard to deal with. They
follow guidelines to the letter.''
   Bennefield said he was having trouble filling the water order.
The Hinesville K mart doesn't carry bottled water, and he said he
was having it shipped from other companies. He had rounded up
84,000 gallons as of Tuesday morning.
   Fort Stewart's public affairs officer, Maj. Don Keeling, said it
isn't unusual for Army units to shop at local businesses for such
items.
   ``We have been going to various vendors to obtain whatever we
think is necessary for the protection of the welfare of our
soldiers,'' Keeling said.
   Bennefield said he doesn't know how much the Army's final tab
will be, but his store is not making a profit off the deal.
   ``You might say we're waving the flag. I'm a patriotic guy,'' he
said.

   Rebel leader Prince Johnson met with
reporters this afternoon and laughed off claims by rival rebels
that he had been killed in an ambush.
   Charles Taylor, Johnson's rival in the yearlong battle to oust
President Samuel Doe, claimed this morning his fighters had killed
Johnson when he was surprised at a rubber plantation outside the
capital Monrovia.
   A man identifying himself as Johnson earlier had called the
British Broadcasting Corp. in London on a radiotelephone to deny he
was dead, shouting into the phone, ``Taylor's a liar! I am alive!''
   In Washington, the State Department said a ``very reliable
source'' saw Johnson alive today.
   The rebels hours earlier failed to show journalists Johnson's
body, as had been promised.
   Taylor's spokesman and defense minister, Tom Woewiyu, who
announced Johnson's death, said in an interview that if anyone
talked with Johnson this afternoon, they were ``talking with a
corpse.''
   Told that the U.S. State Department said Johnson was seen alive
today, hours after the reported ambush, Woewiyu said, ``They must
have a different Johnson.''
   At today's State Department briefing, spokeswoman Margaret
Tutweiler said, ``We have a reliable source this morning that told
us they have seen him today. ... Alive. ... They said they had a
very reliable source that said they had seen him today.''
   Earlier, a rebel commander identified as Oliver Varney led the
ambush that supposedly cost Johnson his life, said rebel officers
at their headquarters on the Firestone Rubber plantation about 37
miles southeast of Monrovia.
   Woewiyu, spokesman for Taylor's National Patriotic Front,
earlier told reporters in Abidjan, in neighboring Ivory Coast, that
Johnson had been killed on Bushrod Island while trying to leave
Monrovia.
   ``Johnson was trying to get out of Monrovia when he ran into our
forces,'' Woewiyu said in a telephone interview.
   Woewiyu had said Johnson's body had been taken to NPF rebel
headquarters and would be shown to reporters.
   The two guerrilla leaders split three months ago in their
violent war to oust Doe, and since then each has threatened to kill
the other.
   Johnson's men had been holding much of Monrovia for several
weeks after launching a surprise attack from a swamp north of the
city. They caught Doe's troops by surprise and took control of the
city's port area and also several residential districts.
   The report of Johnson's death came as an African peacekeeping
force appeared to be meeting further delays.
   Troops from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia have
gathered in neighboring Sierra Leone, but there was no sign of an
early departure.
   Woewiyu said Taylor would be flying to Banjul, Gambia, this week
to talk with Gambia President Sir Dawda Jawara, head of the African
mediation committee trying to end the nearly eight-month civil war
in Liberia.
   This seemed likely to delay the arrival of the peacekeeping
force.
   Johnson was one of the original rebels who invaded Liberia from
Ivory Coast last Dec. 24, according to rebel sources and his
friends.
   Johnson, 31, broke with Taylor several months later, perhaps
over the issue of who would lead the movement.
   Johnson, whose forces have been described by U.S. officials as
more disciplined than Taylor's and perhaps stronger, is entirely of
African descent. Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian, African
ancestry. Americo-Liberians are the descendents of American slaves
who founded Liberia in 1847.
   Johnson, who joined the army in 1981 and also received some U.S.
military training, was arrested during the unsuccessful 1985 coup
led by Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, but escaped and rejoined other
exiles in Ivory Coast.

<HEAD>Number of Idled Acres Off 16 Percent from 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers agreed to idle 26 million acres under
this year's federal crop programs, about 16 percent less than they
did under the 1989 programs, the Agriculture Department said
Tuesday.
   The 1990 contract figures were released by the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. The final
land-idling figure was up 1.2 million acres from the 24.8 million
acres announced in a preliminary report May 18.
   To be eligible for federal price-support and related benefits,
farmers must take a percentage of their crop base acres from
production and put the land in conservation uses that help protect
the soil.
   The idled acres signed up for 1990, according to the final
report, included: corn, 10.1 million acres, down from 10.8 million
acres in 1989; sorghum, 3.1 million, down from 3.3 million; barley,
2.7 million, up from 2.3 million; and oats, 230,000 acres, down
from 310,000. Feed grains totaled about 16 million acres, down from
16.7 million last year.
   Wheat signed up in the 1990 program included 7 million acres of
idled land, down from 9.6 million last year; upland cotton, 1.9
million, down from 3.5 million; and rice, 1.1 million, the same as
last year.
   The report said farmers enrolled 168.8 million acres of feed
grain, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1990 program, which
represented 78 percent of the 216.6 million acres in the national
base for those crops. The idled acres are part of the 168.8 million
acres that were enrolled.
   Last year's gross enrollment was 168 million acres, or 76.4
percent of the 1989 base of 220 million acres.

   King Hussein, walking a tightrope between his powerful Iraqi
neighbor and world opinion, met with Iraq's President Saddam on
Monday in Baghdad, and is to meet with Bush Thursday at the U.S.
chief executive's vacation home in Maine. The Jordanian monarch,
trying to mediate the crisis, ``is carrying Saddam Hussein's views
to President Bush,'' a senior Jordanian official said.
   American leaders are also likely to press the king to close the
embargo loophole in Jordan.
   Aqaba is within reach of U.S. Navy units, which have been
keeping an eye on a tanker that sought, unsuccessfully, to take on
Iraqi oil at the nearby Saudi port of Yanbu.
   The U.S. naval commander in the gulf, Rear Adm. William M.
Fogarty, told reporters aboard the flagship USS LaSalle that he now
has at his command 24 ships, 17,000 men, 200 aircraft and three
aircraft carriers in the gulf, the nearby Arabian Sea and the Red
Sea. Warplanes from the carrier Independence, just outside the
gulf, fly nightly missions over that strategic sea.
   The Navy operated behind a cloud of diplomatic semantics.
   Bush said the U.S. warships would stop oil shipments and other
Iraqi trade. But Navy commanders said they had no specific orders
on how to waylay Iraq shipping, and U.S. officials avoided calling
it a blockade _ a term connoting wartime status.
   A few British and French warships were also in the area, and
Australian, Canadian and Dutch ships were on their way, or soon
will be. But debate grew in some of those countries over the role
their forces would play. Even some members of Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke's own party questioned his decision.
   On Tuesday, an alert went out in the gulf that Iraq may have
planted seaborne mines in an important shipping lane. The warning
was later rescinded, but U.S. Navy commanders took no chances. On
the bow on the U.S. cruiser Antietam, lookouts with binoculars
stood duty, watchful for mines.

   Try moving a medium-sized city 7,000 miles
across an ocean within days to a desert where thousands of people
need to eat, sleep, bathe and defend themselves against a
million-man army.
   That's what the Pentagon is up against in Operation Desert
Shield, its largest military operation and most taxing logistical
problem since Vietnam.
   ``You have two things against you _ geography and time. And as
soon as it gets there, you have to resupply right away,'' said
Duane Cassidy, a retired four-star general who until last year
commanded the United States Transportation Command, the logistical
arm of the military.
   ``This operation is something no one else in the world can do.
Nobody else knows how to do it or practices it,'' said Cassidy, now
a vice president for CSX Corp., a transportation company in
Richmond, Va.
   The Pentagon refused to give specific numbers on troop shipments
and which air carriers are involved. But Cassidy estimated 90
percent of the troops and 50 percent of the cargo arriving in the
Saudi Arabian desert are being flown on commercial airliners. The
Pentagon has used commercial carriers for over 30 years to ferry
troops around the globe.
   That frees up Air Force planes to carry cargo, such as the
C-141, which can hold 200 troops and 34 tons of equipment at the
same time, and the C-5, which can hold 340 troops and 130 tons of
equipment.
   Every 10 minutes, a plane lands in Saudi Arabia. Each non-stop
flight takes about 15 hours, and National Guard and Air Force
Reserve crews are part of the operation.
   Among the U.S. airlines taking part are Eastern, World Airways,
Tower International and Federal Express _ which gives a military
slant to the slogan when it absolutely, positively has to be there
overnight.
   An all-out sealift is also underway, although the Navy has only
eight fast ships capable of carrying tanks, armored personnel
carriers and helicopters on the two-week-long voyage to the Persian
Gulf. It would take all eight ships just to transport the 24th
Mechanized Infantry Division from Savannah, Ga.
   The Navy also has about 94 slower ships in a reserve fleet that
could be pressed into service.
   ``The whole United States Transportation Command _ air lift and
sea lift _ is heavily taxed right now. It puts a strain on the
system. It's not a crisis, but it's certainly busy and hectic,''
said Capt. George Sillia, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon.
   Desert Shield is much different from last year's Panama
invasion, which was a much smaller operation. Besides, the United
States already had forces on the ground in Panama and had its own
bases to land its jets.
   Desert Shield is also lightning-like compared to the escalation
in Vietnam, which by the nature of the conflict occurred much more
gradually.
   There were 300 U.S. military advisers in Vietnam in 1959. Two
helicopter companies were deployed at the end of 1961, raising the
total of U.S. personnel in Vietnam to 1,500.
   By the end of 1963, the U.S. commitment had grown to 16,500
troops. But the first combat troops didn't arrive until 1965, when
a major buildup boosted troop totals to 181,000. Peak involvement
reached 550,000 troops. Most of the equipment was sent by sea.
   The Air Force, which has the largest fleet of transport planes
in the non-communist world, says the Middle East crisis underscores
the need to move troops quickly to flashpoints of conflict around
the globe.
   The Air Force wants to replace its 25-year-old C-141s with the
new C-17s. One new transport could do the work of two older planes
at less cost, Air Force officers said.
   The policy of moving troops and dependents by commercial charter
began in President Eisenhower's administration as a way to cut
costs. It lessened the need for the Air Force to invest in
transport aircraft.
   ``It's an efficient way to move, cargo and government
equipment,'' said Staff Sgt. Mark Johnson of the Military Airlift
Command, the long-range air lift arm of the military based at Scott
Air Force Base in Illinois.
   A 1986 Pentagon study said it would take $2 billion to buy 20
airliners and train crews to fly them. About 95 percent of all
Pentagon personnel flying overseas use commercial flights,
according to government records.

   The Hubble Space Telescope can't look to the
edge of the universe until its vision is corrected, but it is
beginning to give scientists unprecedented views of celestial
objects closer to home.
   NASA released the first such photograph on Monday, a detailed
look into a prolific star-forming area, clearly showing 60 stars in
an area once thought to have only a single, massive star.
   ``The picture has exciting scientific content and demonstrates
the Hubble Space Telescope is very much alive,'' said Ed Weiler,
the NASA scientist in charge of the project.
   The picture was made Aug. 3 of a star cluster called 30 Doradus,
located in the constellation Dorado, the swordfish _ an area in the
southern hemisphere known as a star nursery. The cluster is
believed to be 160,000 to 170,000 years old, a baby in a universe
10 billion to 20 billion years old.

   A backlash against the homeless has
hit progressive Santa Monica, a city so tolerant it serves street
people free meals on the City Hall lawn.
   Grumbling over the city's benevolence toward the homeless
erupted into a revolt after a vagrant with a pair of scissors
mugged an 89-year-old woman in a grocery store in March.
   Although the man was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in
prison, community activists in this city of 96,500 launched a
campaign to oust City Attorney Robert Myers, blaming his policy
against prosecuting nonviolent homelessness-related crimes.
   ``It's an outrage,'' said activist Leslie Dutton. ``These
policies have encouraged the criminal element to stay in our
community. People are prisoners in their apartments. They're even
afraid to go shopping.''

   In a medical first, five tablespoons of

her 4-year-old brother in hopes it will help him form new bone
marrow and beat fast-acting leukemia.
   Michael Sancilio received the transfusion at Johns Hopkins
Oncology Center on Monday.
   His 3-month-old sister, Christina, is too young to donate bone
marrow, the usual treatment for Michael's form of leukemia, and
doctors were afraid he wouldn't survive the three-month wait before
his sister became old enough.
   ``We didn't have any other choice,'' said the youngsters'

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has acted to
restore the rights of victims of Josef Stalin, under whose rule
millions of peasants died of starvation, were shot or sent to labor
camps as ``enemies of the people.''
   In his toughest condemnation yet of Stalin's forced
collectivization of agriculture, which began in the late 1920s,
Gorbachev said Monday that thousands of innocent people still bore
a ``stain of injustice.''
   In a sweeping decree, Gorbachev said the ``repressions conducted
... during the period of collectivization'' were ``unlawful and
contradictory to the main civilian and economic rights of human
beings.''
   He condemned repressions against ``all citizens on political,
social, ethnic, religious and other motives in the 1920s through
the 1950s,'' and moved ``to completely reinstate the rights of
these citizens.''

   The Pentagon will be getting fewer high-tech
weapons of the sea _ the Seawolf submarine and the Arleigh Burke
destroyer _ in line with cuts ordered by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney.
   In an attempt to save $7 billion over the next four fiscal
years, Cheney ordered slowdowns in the production rates of the two
high-tech vessels on Monday.
   A slower production rate for the submarine will cut one ship and
some advance purchased material from next year's budget, resulting
in a savings of $1.8 billion.
   Plans had called for buying 10 of the submarines every three
years. Instead, the Pentagon will reduce the purchase to three
ships every two years, according to a statement released at the
Pentagon.

<TEXT>
   From dinner theater to ``Donahue,'' a
Montana-based religious sect is working to mend an image tattered
by a fuel spill at its underground fallout shelter near Yellowstone
National Park.
   It was four months ago that 31,000 gallons of diesel and
gasoline leaked from tanks buried near the Church Universal and
Triumphant's giant shelter complex. A barrage of criticism and news
coverage ensued.
   Since then, church members have started staging weekly
dinner-theater productions at a church-owned restaurant, and church
leaders invited locals to a Fourth of July hoedown with an outdoor
barbecue and square dance.
   Church leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet and several members also
pleaded their case on the ``Donahue'' talk show.
   ``It's been the best forum for us to talk to the nation about
what we really think,'' church spokesman Murray Steinman says.
``People were just astonished when they saw us, to see that we were
happy, competent, normal people.''
   Yet some local officials still view the church with a wary eye,
citing its sometimes secretive nature and pre-emptive style of
development.
   ``They've kind of done a 360-degree turnaround ... trying to be
nice,'' says Park County commissioner Carlo Cieri, a frequent
critic. ``At this point, I don't think they're sincere about
anything. They'll have to prove it to me. I hope they do.''
   Earlier this year, state officials accused the church of
concealing plans to build its fallout shelter and reopened an
environmental review of church developments in southern Park
County. Church officials said they had no obligation to reveal the
plans.
   Cieri says the church's long-range impact on this county of
rolling prairie and 11,000-foot-high mountain peaks is anyone's
guess. He estimates that 3,000 people associated with the church
have moved into the remote area, straining public-service budgets
and forcing residents to re-examine their frontier antipathy toward
government regulation.
   ``This county used to be, `Just leave 'em alone, let 'em do what
they want,''' Cieri says. But the church has ``built a whole town
above ground and below ground without any permits, with no public
planning whatsoever.''
   The church _ a mixture of Christianity, New Age philosophy and
right-wing politics _ came here in 1981, when it bought a
12,500-acre ranch owned by the late publishing magnate Malcolm
Forbes.
   It since has purchased an additional 18,000 acres and moved its
international headquarters from California to Corwin Springs, a
tiny community a few miles north of the northern boundary of
Yellowstone Park.
   Over the years, church members slowly moved into the area. But a
large influx occurred this year when Prophet said a 12-year cycle
of ``bad karma'' was beginning April 23, presaging a possible
global catastrophe.
   Members built private underground shelters or stocked completed
ones at two church-sponsored housing developments near Emigrant,
while church engineers worked to complete the large complex in a
cloistered meadow 2{ miles north of Yellowstone Park.
   The fuel leaks discovered the second week of April halted most
work. Prophet promised a thorough cleanup.
   Meanwhile, the Church Universal and Triumphant began to show a
less insular aspect to its neighbors.
   In June, church members opened the ``Paradise Players Revue.''
Three nights a week, revue players sing Broadway tunes at the Ranch
Kitchen, a church-owned restaurant at Corwin Springs. Tourists and
locals can even buy a combination show ticket-buffet dinner.
   ``It's really top-quality entertainment,'' says Steinman. ``A
lot of people have told us it's the best show in Montana.''
   The church also extended special invitations to a June 23
performance by Fred Morsell, a professional actor and church member
who staged a dramatization of Frederick Douglass' autobiographies.
   Steinman says the productions had been discussed for some time
and aren't a public-relations ploy, although he admits they haven't
hurt. He points out that the church has held open houses in the
past, similar to this year's Fourth of July celebration.
   ``We always would like to have better relationships with people
in our local area,'' he says.
   Regardless of its image, the church faces an uncertain future.
State officials say cleanup of the fuel spill _ paid for by the
church _ will continue for months and cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars.
   John Arrigo of the state Water Quality Bureau says that as of
mid-July, only 6,000 gallons of the spilled fuel has been
recovered. Additional fuel has evaporated and some was contained in
6,600 cubic yards of contaminated soil that is being treated in a
nearby field.
   A state lawsuit halted construction at the 750-person fallout
shelter, and Park County officials placed a moratorium on sewage
permits for most underground shelters at the Emigrant housing
developments.
   Two Billings lawyers hired by the state are pondering the next
legal move to enforce the cleanup and prevent additional
environmental problems at church-owned developments.
   Steinman says the church is willing to negotiate with the state
over the cleanup and future environmental concessions.
   As for their current life without bomb shelters, Steinman says
church members aren't overly concerned: ``I think everyone here
recognizes that our faith in God is first and foremost, and I think
everything will work out. ... We believe he will see us through to
the end.''

   Thousands of times each day, a
white-tailed deer comes nose to grille with a motor vehicle, often
with disastrous results.
   And not just to the deer, though as many as 350,000 deer die
each year on America's roads. Last year, 131 people died in
collisions with animals, and damages and the costs of cleaning up
total in the millions of dollars.
   Wildlife and highway officials say there's no simple way to keep
the creatures and man from colliding on the nation's roads.
   A growing deer population _ there are now 16 million to 18
million white-tailed deer in the United States and Canada _ and
``human sprawl'' are forcing traffic engineers and wildlife
officials to seek ways to keep the animals off the road.
   ``It's a fairly severe problem, particularly if it's your car
that's been hit,'' said Richard McCabe of the Wildlife Management
Institute in Washington, D.C.
   ``The problem is that with concentrated deer populations,
particularly in states like Pennsylvania and northern Wisconsin
that are semimountainous, you have highways that intersect travel
routes of deer,'' he said.
   In West Virginia, the death rate grew from 2,660 deer in 1979 to
6,326 in 1989. The typical animal that was struck caused about
$1,300 in damage, said Roger Russell of the state Division of
Highways.
   Pennsylvania, which has a deer population of more than 1.5
million, spends about $8 million each year to collect dead deer off
the roads, said state Game Commission spokesman Ted Godshall.
   Game officers picked up more than 40,000 deer carcasses from the
highways last year; they are given to needy families, fed to fish
or buried.
   ``I know that it takes a minimum of two hours to pick up a deer,
and they usually have to drive 50 miles or more,'' Godshall said.
``It can take two or three hours of an officer's time. It's a
tremendous bill.''
   The remedies for road kills are varied. Among them is more
careful planning of where roads go; re-examination of grasses and
shrubs planted along roads; dispensing with salt as a way of
ridding roads of ice, because deer like salt; and more warning
signs.
   Colorado and Pennsylvania are considering rerouting deer over
and under major thoroughfares, McCabe said. This seems ``to have
some benefits, but of course deer populations can change,'' he
said. ``Underpasses and overpasses are fairly expensive
propositions if you don't know whether the deer are going to move.''
   Fences, by all accounts the most effective remedy, also are
expensive, costing as much as $200,000 a mile. A more recent
solution, wildlife warning reflectors, costs $7,000 per mile.
   ``The reflectors light up and set up an unnatural moving light
pattern, which scares the deer,'' said John Strieter, president of
Strieter Corp., which sells the reflectors. ``We don't know what's
going on in the deer's head, but eyewitnesses say the deer react
with them and change directions.''
   In Minnesota, the reflectors are being used at 30 sites, with a
dozen more to be added. Susan Mulvihill, accident surveillance
safety engineer for the state Department of Transportation, said
they seem to be working.
   ``When we figure out a benefit cost, we use 60 percent reduction
as an average, so they're pretty effective if you install them
right,'' Mulvihill said. ``We've had pretty good luck with them
here. It's worked better than anything else we tried.''
   But the high cost and mixed results at a two-mile test-strip
along Interstate 79 have made West Virginia officials skeptical.
   ``It is fairly expensive and it isn't 100 percent effective in
reducing deer kill ...,'' Russell said. ``The only thing that is
100 percent effective is an 8-foot tall fence.''
   Whistles attached to vehicles to frighten deer by emitting
high-pitched sounds also have shown limited effectiveness, McCabe
said.
   ``I don't hold much credence in it at all,'' he said. ``It may
scare off deer that are standing in the roads, but it doesn't do
much for those out of the periphery of the sounds that are running
along the highway. Those tend to be the deer that are hit anyway.''
   ``Everything has been tried, nothing works,'' Godshall said.
``Fencing is the best thing, but they're prohibitively expensive.''
   The problem, wildlife officials say, is not really with the deer
at all. It's people.
   ``People are inclined to spread out in attractive areas that are
hilly and have forests _ areas that are traditionally and
ecologically principal and critical habitats of deer and certainly
other wildlife,'' McCabe said.
   ``There's more traffic, more miles of travel being done each
year, and more roadways to accommodate that traffic,'' he said.
``What it all comes down to is when a deer bangs into a car, people
tend to get annoyed at the deer, but it's the people who are more
or less invading the deer's habitat, and all of this is a
consequence of human sprawl.''

<HEAD>From `Nightwatch' to `Personalities' on Fox: What Made Charlie
Run?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A question _ for you, Charlie Rose. As you might
put it:
   You're host of ``Nightwatch.'' You leave the acclaimed CBS
overnight show for Fox Broadcasting Co. You're going to front a
half-hour daily magazine show called ``Personalities.''
   Why?
   ``That's absolutely the right question to ask,'' says Rose, who
learned how to handle interviewers during nearly 10,000 interviews
in his 6{-year stint on ``Nightwatch.'' He settles back with a
Heineken and salted peanuts.
   ``It was an opportunity for me,'' he says.
   He's just interviewed Gov. Mario Cuomo, who's not saying whether
he'll run for president in 1992, and Rose looks relaxed, almost as
if he's enjoying this. There's no sign of the breathless, fidgeting
intensity that shredded his ``Nightwatch'' questions into sentence
fragments.
   ``It was finding an opportunity to do something in a different
form: a daily magazine, 30 minutes versus two hours,'' he said.
``The new broadcast brings together a different group of people,
four different subjects each day, a different pace. I was attracted
to that. The idea was good, I liked the people that were involved
and I thought Fox was an interesting place to be.''
   The show, designed to lead into or out of the evening news,
premieres Sept. 3 on 117 stations covering 82 percent of the
country. Rose says he's looking forward to a substantially bigger
audience than ``Nightwatch,'' which averaged 500,000 to 1 million
viewers in its heyday (well, its heynight, actually).
   ``Personalities,'' is a departure for him.
   ``It's not a long conversation,'' he said. ``I recorded, today,
40 minutes. I would say that we'll probably use five or six
minutes. On `Nightwatch,' if we taped 44 minutes, we'd have 43
minutes on the air.''
   He leaves CBS with regret, he said.
   ``I loved CBS,'' Rose said. ``I am happy I am at Fox now.
Leaving `Nightwatch' was painful because it was the most satisfying
professional experience I have ever had.''
   CBS told him his future was assured. ``CBS was very clear about
how much they wanted me to stay,'' he said, ``and they were also
very aware that what Fox was offering, they didn't have.
   ``They were not in the syndication business and did not have a
show that would be on following the news every night. They did not
have the opportunities that Fox would have in building a network,''
he said.
   ``And they said to me, `Come back whenever you want to.''' Rose
smiled. Then he chuckled. ``It doesn't mean they meant it, but they
said it.
   ``I may find out that I really miss the pyschic income that I
got from `Nightwatch' and I'll go back to it,'' he said. ``I don't
think so, because I tend to move on in my life.''
   Rose's TV career has been a strange patchwork. A Henderson,
N.C., native and graduate of Duke University and its law school, he
was practicing law and doing free lance TV work when he met TV
journalist Bill Moyers in 1974.
   Moyers offered him what would be the job of managing editor of
the PBS series ``Bill Moyers' International Report.'' The next
year, Rose became executive producer of ``Bill Moyers' Journal,''
also on PBS.
   Rose declares his debt to Moyers, his friend and mentor, for
giving him ``values, techniques, insights and overall good, common
sense ... and a sense of excellence.''
   It took longer to find his niche in commercial TV. In 1976, he
joined NBC News as a Washington political reporter. A year later,
he was co-host of ``A.M. Chicago,'' a daily morning talk show on
the Windy City's ABC-owned WLS-TV.
   In 1979, he moved to Dallas and the daily ``Charlie Rose Show,''
airing mornings on KXAS-TV, an NBC affiliate. The show, later
syndicated nationally, moved to WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., and
folded in 1983.
   In 1984 came ``Nightwatch,'' a small-scale interview show where
Rose's adrenaline-jagged intensity worked to his advantage. He once
interviewed a man who was keeping silent as an environmental
protest.
   ``I'd ask him a question and he'd gesture. It was wonderful,''
Rose said. ``Once I did that, I was convinced I had a shot at
making most things be interesting.''

<HEAD>Recession? Why It Began Last January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you ask Albert Sindlinger whether Saddam
Hussein can provoke a recession in the United States, he will
respond: ``How can he create a recession that is already nearly
eight months old?''
   Sindlinger's staff measures economic strength or weakness by
calling Americans on the telephone _ every day, every week, in
every state but Alaska and Hawaii _ to find out about their
financial condition.
   Based on their detailed responses, nearly 4,300 of them for the
month of July, he determines if they have what he calls positive or
negative household liquidity. Last month, 68.7 percent of
households reported negatively.
   To Sindlinger, an octogenerian who has been making such calls
for more than 30 years, that evidence of recession is overwhelming,
conclusive, beyond debate. Consumer activity, he points out, makes
up most of gross national product.
   Government officials don't agree. They say GNP is continuing to
grow, albeit by a tiny percentage, and they have said so
repeatedly. They are likely to continue saying so until six
straight months of shrinkage occur.
   ``They've manipulated the figures,'' says Sindlinger, who vows
later this month to demonstrate to corporate and financial clients
how they did it. All he will say for now is that it involved
official revisions of GNP made July 27.
   Had they revised correctly, he says, GNP for the first and
second quarters of 1990 would have shrunk by 0.2 percent and 0.3
percent, respectively, instead of having risen, according to the
government, by 1.7 percent and 1.2 percent.
   To Sindlinger, nothing speaks more clearly about the economy
than the pocketbooks of America's households. They are the
economy's strength or weakness; what happens to them happens
collectively to the country.
   Calling from headquarters in Wallingford, Pa., Sindlinger
researchers ask heads of households these questions:
   1. Is your total combined household annual income now higher or
the same as it was six months ago?
   2. Do you think your combined household annual income in the
next six months will remain the same, or be higher or lower than
now?
   3. Do you believe that in the next six months there will be more
or the same numbers of jobs where you work?
   4. Do you expect that business conditions in the next six months
will be the same or better in your area?
   If the respondent answers any of the four questions negatively,
the household is said to have negative household liquidity. Right
now, says Sindlinger, you can find negative liquidity in most of
the country.
   Negative liquidity went beyond 50 percent of all households _
52.7 percent _in January, rose to nearly 80 percent in February and
March, dropped to 74.3 percent in April, and has been just under 70
percent since then.
   Based on interviewing through August 2, he lists 28 states as
being clearly in recession, with the most pronounced weakness being
in New England, the Southeast, Southwest and the ``Mideast,'' or
states of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,
and the District of Columbia.
   The strongest states in the Sindlinger accounting are Illinois,
Washington, Oregon, Ohio, Indiana, Minnesota, Utah and Wisconsin. A
notch below them are Iowa, Nevada, Colorado, South Dakota, Kansas,
Montana and Nebraska.
   Barely over the 50 percent line, a critical demarcation in the
Sindlinger thesis, are Idaho, Missouri and Michigan, and sitting
right on it are North Dakota and Wyoming. The rest, 28 of them,
have negative liquidity.
   By Sindlinger's reckoning, the recession began long before
Iraq's Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, even if it still isn't
reflected in official government figures. But it will be, he says,
noting weakness in July retail sales.
   He agrees that Mideast troubles could worsen things, but he will
not, he says, make a projection without checking with his
informants, without listening to the voice of the people.
   ``They tell us if there's a recession,'' he said. ``We don't
tell them.''

<HEAD>250,000 Children Join Nationwide Pen Pal Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quarter of a million youngsters will
experience the fun side of writing this school year, penning
letters to new-found friends about pets, bratty siblings, favorite
foods and neighborhoods.
   ``So often children use writing as a functional tool,'' said
Elizabeth White, the new principal at Cunningham Elementary School
in Fluvanna County, Va. ``In this program, teachers are helping
students practice their writing skills while kids see it as just
plain fun.''
   The Pen Pal Discovery program completed a pilot project during
the last school year, when 130 third graders in the rural Virginia
county exchanged letters with the same number of students in Tampa,
Fla.
   More than 250,000 third and fourth graders at 5,000 schools in
10 states have signed up for the program this school year, five
times the number expected by the program's creator, Kelly
Communications, a Charlottesville, Va., health publishing firm.
   ``I thought it was a very effective program. It was creative.''
said Sara Van Lier, a new third grade teacher at Forest Hills
Elementary School in Tampa, Fla.
   ``The program involves writing in a sneaky kind of way,'' she
said. ``You are telling the youngsters, `This isn't really work
kids. This is something else.'''
   White was assistant principal at Columbia District and Fork
Union elementary schools during the experimental project last year.
She said, ``I saw a lot of excitement in the children, especially
when they found something in common, like liking the same groups or
having cats as pets.''
   ``Being exposed to children their age in another state or
country broadens their horizons. Children their age usually are
only familiar with their own environment. It's exciting to learn
other ways of thinking and talking,'' added White, who has been
writing a pen pal in Australia for about 20 years, since the sixth
grade.
   The youngsters, under close teacher supervision, exchanged five
letters during the course of the school year with third graders at
Tampa's Forest Hills.
   The drawback, acknowledged Van Lier, was ``it was hard to get
the children to bring in stamps to participate.'' Many of the
youngsters are from poverty-stricken families and ``it's hard for
them to bring in anything.''
   The pen pal program, the brainchild of Kelly employee Alan
Phillips, could not have come at a better time.
   A test of 18,000 fourth, sixth and eleventh graders in 1988
found their ability to write informative, persuasive and
imaginative pieces was about the same as their counterparts in
1974. The study was conducted by the Natioonal Assessment of
Educational Progress, popularly known as the Nation's Report Card.
   Eighth-grade English teachers reported that 45 percent of their
students wrote papers of a paragraph or two weekly, and only 14
percent wrote a one-or two-page paper each week. Only 6 percent
wrote papers or three or more pages each year.
   Forty-two percent of the teachers said they spend about one hour
each week on instructing and helping students with writing, 30.2
percent spend 30 minutes or less.
   The American Association of Parents &amp; Children said four out of
10 eleventh graders cannot write an adequate description of their
qualifications for a job.
   The Pen Pal Discovery program provides, free-of-charge,
letter-writing kits that explain the various types of letters and
the different parts of each, like the ``heading, greeting, body,
closing.''
   The kits also include special writing paper for letters. To
foster ideas about subject matter, ``data pages'' are provided for
children to record information about themselves, their state and
neighborhood.
   Teachers oversee use of the kits and are encouraged to
incorporate the project into the regular classroom lessons. Once
the letters are written individually in class, the teacher sends
them in a packet to the pen pals of the pre-matched class.
   The pilot program also tried individual mailings of the letters.
Officials conceded that method failed.
   This school year, students will send letters each month
beginning in January.
   Judy Lewis, executive vice president at Kelly, said an
information survey of the teachers found they liked the program
because it is self-contained, well-organized, easy to follow and
supports their curriculum.
   Classrooms are matched by computer with the purpose of pairing
urban and rural schools, schools in New York with those in
California and schools with unique cultural differences, said Lewis.
   ``There is nothing like this that we found exist,'' said Lewis.
``There is nothing that takes the concept of pen pals communicating
... beyond giving them a pen pal and saying write.
   ``We suggest what to write about, give them materials to use to
write back and forth and provide the setting under which it can
occur.''
   Lewis said Kelly Communications is asking corporations to
provide financial support for the program. The cost is estimated at
$3 per child.

<HEAD>Jeffersonian Idea Brings Power to Powerless in Rural South</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>APPOMATTOX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quiet revolution is under way in dozens
of rural Southern counties where people historically unrepresented
are nurturing a shadow government to help them take ``the last step
up from slavery.''
   This alternative power structure, conceived by a descendant of
slaves and based on Thomas Jefferson's ideas, is called simply
``the assembly.''
   It has brought millions of dollars' worth of new schools, miles
of paved roads and, most important to the assembly members, who are
mostly black, a voice that can no longer be ignored.
   In Appomattox County, gospel songfests and candy sales helped
the local assembly raise $65,000, purchase six acres and clear the
land for a community center.
   ``We were always going from one place to another, having our
meetings,'' said Milton Chambers, the 36-year-old assembly
president, a foundry worker who lives three miles from the spot
where the Civil War ended 125 years ago.
   ``To have a building to call our own,'' he said, members gladly
sacrificed, some contributing hundreds of dollars.
   ``The only way to control our destiny,'' he said, ``is to be
able to turn on and cut off the lights when we want to.''
   In a phrase, he was stating the goal and purpose of the 40-odd
assemblies in Virginia and other Southern states: organization for
self-help and representation.
   ``I'll say it 'til I die, if you give people something, you'll
build dependency,'' said Don Anderson, a black former congressional
committee lawyer who created the assembly system. ``But if you just
organize the voluntarism, they'll do it themselves. ...
   ``And once it's done it's like magic.''
   For 22 years, Anderson has been trying to work that magic
through his Washington, D.C.-based National Association for the
Southern Poor.
   With a staff of 10 and an annual budget of nearly $500,000,
mostly from individual donors and foundations, its goal is to
create assemblies in 258 Southern counties with low incomes and
black populations of about 30 percent to 80 percent.
   Anderson has written that his aim was to give these people ``a
vehicle for solving their problems, and for taking the last step up
from slavery.''
   Most assemblies are in Virginia and North Carolina, but new ones
are being formed in Georgia and South Carolina and plans are to
expand to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee.
   To spread his self-help concept across the region, Anderson
touts assemblies' accomplishments to date: the paving of 20 miles
of roads in black areas of Washington County, N.C.; job training
for the hardcore unemployed in Portsmouth, Va.; $2.5 million in
water line extensions and home renovations through federal grants
in Jones County, N.C.; and many other projects.
   The assemblies operate within ``a very refined structure, based
on Jefferson's idea of ward republics,'' Anderson explained.
   ``We go into a county and divide it up into manageable groups of
50 people each,'' the equivalent of Jefferson's wards, Anderson
said. ``And these are represented in a central decision-making body
called the assembly.''
   To establish an assembly, Anderson's organizers usually spend
two months locating community leaders and bringing them together in
preliminary meetings. Anderson, who attends a final organizational
gathering, said it costs $18,000 on average to organize a county.
   Procedurally, the assembly is ``a very accurate copy of the
British House of Commons,'' said Anderson, who holds a degree from
the London School of Economics.
   At a recent meeting of the Assembly of Charlotte County, Va., in
a muggy school auditorium, members who were dressed as if for
church closely followed parliamentary rules _ calling ``questions''
printed on an agenda named the Order Paper, rising whenever
addressing the group, and directing all comments to the Speaker.
   The difference is that at the House of Commons, they don't serve
fried chicken and biscuits beforehand.
   Assembly members must be at least 18 and must be registered
voters. Although the groups are non-partisan, voter registration
often is a first-priority project.
   The relationship between the assembly and local elected
officials varies.
   ``I see it as a system to assist the government that's in
place,'' said Andrew Murray, who heads the assembly in Caswell
County, N.C.
   Others see it as a watchdog organization. The Appomattox
assembly and others have appointed members to monitor county
supervisor and school board meetings.
   In Surry County, Va., three assembly members sit on the
five-member county Board of Supervisors.
   ``So all the issues that come up in the assembly are heard by
members that can actually vote on them,'' said Surry Assembly
President Thomas Hardy, who also chairs the county planning
commission.
   Surry's assembly, founded 21 years ago, is the oldest and most
successful. Hardy proudly showed off its projects to a reporter.
Some came about through grants the group applied for, some through
its pressure on local officials:
   _ A neat, 50-unit subsidized apartment complex, built after the
assembly decried the falling-down, tin-roofed shacks that many
lived in, is to be expanded.
   _ A $1 million medical clinic put up by the assembly with
foundation grants has visiting specialists and is working to find
full-time doctors.
   _ A handsome $540,000 recreation center hums with activity: a
summer day camp program for schoolchildren, meetings of senior
citizens, civic group gatherings, even wedding receptions.
   As everyone benefits from the improvements, relations between
the races have improved, Hardy said. A white official, Sheriff W.C.
Andrews, agreed.
   ``It's a lot of times that maybe we don't see eye to eye,'' the
sheriff said. ``But we get together and try to work things out.''
   Of all the changes the assembly has brought in Surry, a farming
county where pork, peanuts and pines are grown, Hardy is proudest
of the schools.
   Before the assembly started its work with a house-by-house voter
registration drive that made clear the black majority, the schools
``were in a desperate condition,'' he said.
   At the high school, ``We didn't have a gymnasium; we didn't have
a cafeteria.''
   After integration was ordered, all but nine white students left
the 1,300-student district for private schools, according to a 1971
news story. Only two of the district's 60 teachers were white, but
whites held all but one seat on the school board.
   Now, there's a brand new $1 million elementary school, a $4
million high school. Surry's per capita student spending is $5,633,
nearly the highest in Virginia.
   And although the assembly sometimes criticizes the black
superintendent, ``He has been successful in working to bring at
least 80 percent of the white children back,'' Hardy said.
   The black-white ratio among students is now 73 percent to 27
percent, according to Martha Rollings, assistant to the
superintendent for instruction. In the general population, about
six out of 10 people are black, Hardy said.
   There are 58 black teachers, 34 white. Three blacks and two
whites sit on the school board.
   Improvement in standardized test scores has been dramatic. For
example, Surry eighth graders ranked in the eighth percentile
nationally in reading in 1979. Now they're at the 49th _ ``within
reach,'' Ms. Rollings said, of the national average 50th
percentile. ``We're working on it,'' she added.
   Anderson knows the statistics and the faces they represent.
   ``You don't have to think of symbolic changes,'' he said. ``You
can transform a whole community.''

   Don Anderson was a student in London,
attending sessions of the House of Commons when he could, but
Thomas Jefferson was on his mind.
   ``What country can preserve its liberties,'' Jefferson wrote,
``if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their
people preserve the spirit of resistance?''
   Rejuvenate democracy. Return power to the grassroots. ``Divide
the counties into wards,'' Jefferson wrote.
   In Anderson's mind, Jefferson's ideas became a resolution: He
would look for a way to apply them in the American South, where he
came from, to empower poor blacks.
   ``Everybody said it's impossible to organize an entire county or
city,'' the 58-year-old Anderson says now, years later. ``Well,
that's exactly what we've done, about 40 times.''
   The ``assemblies'' that he launched flourish in some places,
struggle in others, but Anderson keeps fanning the ember. He might
travel to a country church hall to explain his system or to a
Manhattan penthouse to mingle and seek donations.
   Anderson, who grew up in a middle-class black family, is a
graduate of the London School of Economics and the University of
Michigan and its law school. He writes, acts in Shakespeare
productions and plays the bagpipes.
   But politics and economics have been his focus. In 1964, as
counsel to a U.S. House subcommittee, he helped draft the
anti-poverty Economic Opportunity Act.
   He concluded that alleviating poverty and not just its symptoms
would require a self-help structure for whole communities, so in
1968, he founded the National Association for the Southern Poor.
   ``I left the marbled halls of the Rayburn Building,'' he wrote,
``for the remotest rural areas of Virginia and North Carolina to
put ... the ideas of Jefferson to work.''
   Earlier this year, Anderson's group received a plaque from the
White House, recognizing it as one of President Bush's ``thousand
points of light.''

   When Lukasz Malachowski edited an influential
weekly back home in Poland, the bottom line was maintaining
journalistic integrity while avoiding the ire of Communist
government censors.
   Came the revolution and all that changed. The censors were gone,
but so were the government subsidies for essentials like paper and
ink. Competing for survival became the new bottom line.
   ``Everything was subsidized or donated. We never had to think
whether it could be sold or not. ... Now we have to think over all
these things or nobody will be able to survive,'' says Malachowski,
35, whose Catholic Weekly Review essentially went broke with the
change to a market economy.
   This summer, Malachowski is one of 15 Eastern European
journalists spending 10 weeks at American magazine like Elle,
Rolling Stone, Business Week, Family Circle and Esquire in an
internship program sponsored by the U.S. government and the
magazines.
   The interns, seasoned journalists in their mid-30s from
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and
Romania, have come to the United States to learn how a free and
competitive press works.
   ``They have to learn to operate a magazine as a business,'' says
Anne Sutherland Fuchs, senior vice president and publisher of Elle,
who organized the magazine industry's role in the internship
program.
   ``They haven't been faced with circulation decisions,
subscription-pricing decisions ... advertising rates. Everything
has been dictated _ whether it's the kind of paper they print on or
how many copies they print,'' she says.
   ``It's a whole different ballgame when it's a free press.''
   Sitting in his cubicle at Elle magazine, Peter Janos Sos, 41,
leafed through a copy of Kepes 7 (Illustrated Week in English), the
Hungarian family weekly of which he is deputy editor in chief. The
first advertisement in the 60-page magazine appeared on page 30; it
promoted paving stones.
   Then he pulled an issue of Elle toward him and turned the glossy
pages filled with ads enticing the reader to buy expensive
cosmetics, designer clothing, glamorous perfumes and chic
accessories.
   ``At first I thought the quality of advertisements is not the
job of the editor but the job of the advertiser,'' says Sos, a
burly man who chooses his English words carefully. ``I talked about
it with Anne Fuchs and she said `I would never take the
advertisement of X here on the first pages because it's not
beautiful enough.'''
   The Eastern European journalists admire the sleek look of their
host publications, their advertising know-how and technical
expertise. Above all, they admire the huge sums of money that go
into making the magazines. They are also fiercely proud of their
magazines at home. But this pride goes hand in hand with a deep
frustration about their financial and technical limitations.
   Gyorgyi Kocsis, 36, an intern at Business Week, helped found a
weekly economic magazine 12 years ago in Budapest, Hungary, that
broke new ground in up-to-date, critical reporting at a time when
most publications were mouthpieces for the government.
   HVG, the Hungarian initials for World Economy Weekly, became ``a
very popular quality magazine in Hungary,'' says Ms. Kocsis. But in
the last two years, she adds, as new newspapers and magazines hit
the market, it lost 15 percent of its readership and suffered an
``identity crisis.''
   She pointed on her cluttered desk at Business Week to a recent
issue of her magazine. The cover shows pieces of paper representing
stock shares coming out of factory chimneys. The illustration is in
black and white and the paper on which it is printed is rough.
   ``Some of our ideas on the cover, gags, pictures can be on any
world magazine. But I have to look with a looking glass because the
printing is so awful,'' says Ms. Kocsis. HVG's look suffers badly
in comparison to ``all the beautiful magazines on the newsstand
here.''
   Suddenly, unable to contain her frustration, she gestures toward
her magazine and exclaims, ``Now, I hate it!''
   But as the Eastern European magazines get slicker and fatter
with advertisements and censorship becomes a thing of the past,
even journalists who are ardent supporters of a free-market economy
feel a bittersweet twinge as their old world collapses.
   The ``family business'' atmosphere at HVG probably will
disappear, Ms. Kocsis says wistfully.
   ``Probably it will be more professional and big and sort of
westernized. We will lose this feeling. We are going to be news
factory, which can be good and useful and profiting, but probably
we will lose this friendly atmosphere, I think. But we have to grow
up.''
   Malachowski, an intern at Family Circle, recently lost his job
as a top editor at the Catholic Weekly Review in Warsaw, Poland. As
the only independent newspaper tolerated by the Communist Party,
its coverage of politics and social issues was very influential, he
says.
   Today, the Catholic Church, trying to cope in a free-market
economy and pay its bills, has let the weekly become a slim
pamphlet on religious affairs, Malachowski says.
   ``We always treated our press as a sort of art piece and now we
must start to think about this as a sort of product,'' says
Malachowski, whose wire-rimmed glasses and tweed jacket reinforce
his professorial air.
   Anyway, he adds, people aren't as interested in art any more.
Poetry, he notes, thrived in the 1960s and 1970s in Poland when
government censorship was extremely strict.
   ``The problem is that today you have no censorship, but much
less people are interested in poetry,'' he says. ``A new generation
thinks about commercial things _ about houses, cars, about normal
things as they are in the whole Western world.''
   ``The condition of the economy in Poland gives us an absolutely
new situation,'' says Malachowski. ``The press is (financially)
bankrupt. It is difficult to survive with magazines and papers. We
need to see the average American paper or magazine to find out how
it works.''
   American know-how goes a long way. But it doesn't translate
directly into hard currency. The survival of Eastern European
magazines and newspapers also depends on Western companies
investing capital in them. HVG, Kepes 7 and Mlady Svet, the largest
weekly in Czechoslovakia, all have made deals with foreign
companies or are close to doing so.
   Mlady Svet, the Young Word in English, takes three weeks to
produce, complains Marek Hlavica, 28, an editor at the weekly. He
also is a singer and harmonica player and is spending his
internship at Rolling Stone magazine.
   If his magazine, founded by the youth group of the Communist
Party, is to stay ahead of its growing pack of competitors, he
says, it needs an infusion of money from foreign investors to
upgrade its technical capabilities.
   ``The magazine is one stone in the mosaic of the whole society,
and it must change with those things _ politics, society and so
on,'' Hlavica says.
   ``But we are optimists. We've got a good starting position.
That's very important. We've got tradition, good tradition. We've
got good writers. We've got opportunity to cooperate with foreign
companies. So we are optimists. Why not?''

<TEXT>
   Poland's noble families, dispersed around
the world or reduced to cramped walkups in their native land, have
have little but memories of their once elegant estates.
   Most of the landed gentry's homes have been destroyed since the
Communists nationalized their property in the late 1940s.
   Now, with the Communist regime gone, a last-chance effort is
afoot to preserve the remaining historic manors, either by
returning them to their former owners or finding new ones.
   Ludwika Sobanska-Tyszkiewiczowa, born to one of Poland's noblest
families and married to another, remembers the vast estate of her
birth in the Ukraine. At age 2, she played with nuts on the floor
as the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 raged outside the sandbagged
windows.
   As a newlywed on the eve of World War II, she moved to her
husband's manor in eastern Poland. Within a year, she was swimming
the river outside with her baby strapped to her back and the Red
Army in pursuit.
   Equally vivid are recollections of the carefree opulence of
those years between the wars, when the lawns and ballroom of the
family palace at Guzow, outside Warsaw, was filled with Poland's
dignitaries.
   With a wistfulness echoed even by Poles of common birth, Mrs.
Sobanska lingers on the memory of her family's ``dwory,'' manor
houses of the self-sufficient estates on which rural Poland's
social and economic system was based for four centuries.
   Dwory were administrative centers for the surrounding farmland,
warehouses and mills. Some were palaces, others large farmhouses.
They were built in tune with the vacillating fortunes of Poland's
passionately nationalist, clannish and independent nobility, which
was 10 percent of the population in the 16th century and among
Europe's largest through the 18th century.
   Of Mrs. Sobanska's properties in Poland, Guzow and a Warsaw
mansion still stand, but they no longer belong to her. What did not
succumb to war or shifting borders was taken by the new Communist
state.
   Stately homes of Poland's much-romanticized gentry became the
orphanages and factory headquarters of People's Poland. Farmland
was divided among the peasants.
   Without money for proper upkeep, dwory fell to ruin and were
abandoned, with tragic consequences to the nation's cultural
heritage.
   Forty-five years later, little remains. Of the estimated 20,000
historic homes that survived World War II, only about 2,000 are
salvageable.
   Nostalgia, the desire to right wrongs and capitalist zeal for a
good bargain propel the preservation effort.
   Former owners may apply to reclaim their properties. The Culture
Ministry and the post-Communist era's first private real estate
companies also are hunting new buyers.
   ``What is happening in Poland now offers great hope for
monuments,'' said Tadeusz Zielinewicz, the ministry's chief
building conservator. ``We conservators have always been saying the
best way of protecting a monument is a good use, a good owner. The
state was not such a good owner.''
   In many ways, it is painful work.
   ``It has all turned into ruin,'' Mrs. Sobanska said after a
recent tour of the palace at Guzow, 25 miles east of Warsaw, now
headquarters for an adjacent sugar beet factory. ``It will be too
late for me, but maybe someone from my family can invest.''
   Pravin Shah, a jeans merchant from Wales, stood somberly before
the decaying facade and boarded-up windows of a manor in Zdunowo.
   ``It makes me sad to see something so beautiful standing there,
waiting,'' said Shah, who is looking over Polish manors in search
of an investment.
   Grass covered the sweeping drive and sewage choked the
ornamental ponds. Sunlight filtering through a hole in the roof
touched the few bits of ornamental plaster still in place.
   The manor was used as an agricultural school, then abandoned for
a decade, and a young Polish architect bought it for a song two
years ago.
   He wants to make it into a 55-room hotel and restaurant just 45
minutes north of the capital, but needs $2.5 million. Janusz
Lipinski, co-founder of Poland's first real estate agency, Korona,
is looking for a Western investor who sees the potential in a
country so short of tourist accommodations.
   Lipinski has 100 or more applications from families seeking to
buy back homes that were nationalized after the war. Parliament is
working out favorable terms, but most families don't have enough
money.
   This ``re-privatization'' of homes, as opposed to farmland, is
encouraged by many people who harbor a deep respect for the
stratified society of Poland's past glory. Despite four decades of
communism, the names of aristocratic Polish families are easily
recalled.
   In July, when Princess Klaudia Sanguszko visited the family
estate near Tarnow in southeastern Poland, former servants lined up
to meet her and the town council made her son, called ``the young
prince'' by newspapers, an honorary citizen.
   Purchases by foreigners are more controversial and few have come
to fruition. Members of Parliament, nervous about Poland's being
``bought out,'' especially by a united Germany next door, voted
last month to prohibit sales of state-owned property to foreigners.
   Long-term leases are allowed, and privately owned tracts of land
can be sold with Interior Ministry permission. Joint-venture
companies also can buy.
   Joanna Onyskiewicz, Lipinski's partner in the Korona agency, is
adamant about bringing commercial viability to Poland's historic
properties.
   ``We have no other chance, in a country where the kitty is
empty, to save our heritage ourselves,'' she said.
   Low prices are a large part of the lure. A manor in rundown
condition can sell for as little as $1,000.
   Korona offers a 10-room country house with surrounding gardens
that could be remodeled as a small hotel, for a modest total
investment of $250,000.
   There is the stuff of dreams: a gutted, 36-bedroom palace from
the early 18th century on 30 acres of parks that once were
landscaped. The Rubber Industry Institute will sell it for $200,000.
   Falling in love with a Polish dwor is just the beginning.
   ``Buyers face a fantastic amount of red tape,'' Lipinski said.
``You have to be patient in Poland.''
   Both initial questions _ Who is the owner and how much does it
cost? _ require detective work in the infamous bureaucratic maze.
   Some properties are government-owned with a state industry as a
long-term tenant.
   Buyers also face the daunting task of a complete renovation,
from water pipes to roof, in a nation short of building materials.
Strict rules for historical restoration must be followed.
   An ugly, polluting industry may have been built nearby, Lupinski
said, sighing over a paint factory beside a moated, 15th century
castle.
   ``It is a pleasure to work with these buildings but . . . so
depressing to see their situation,'' he said, then pointed at the
crumbling, lifeless Zdunowo mansion and added: ``That from 45 years
of communism.''

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the
mighty Bundesbank, is supervising the painful transformation of
East Germany into part of a capitalist state.
   He assumed the job with reluctance, but appears to be the right
man for it.
   With a keen sense of politics, the man in charge of West
Germany's central bank swept his doubts aside and accepted the role
thrust on him by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to unite the two
Germanys more quickly than anticipated.
   Only days before Kohl announced his plans for monetary union of
West and East Germany, Poehl still spoke of it cautiously as
something that would take at least a year.
   Insiders say Poehl was furious over Kohl's failure to consult
him, but the banker saw quickly which way the political weathervane
pointed. He accepted Kohl's decision and the West German mark
became East Germany's currency July 1.
   ``During the monetary union, Poehl the politician had no trouble
silencing Poehl the economist,'' said Der Spiegel, the West German
news magazine.
   When the government and public opinion wanted monetary union,
Poehl ``could not play the role of a nagging accountant,'' it said.
   Poehl, opposed to a 1-1 exchange rate of East and West marks,
succeeded in persuading the government to limit the amount that
could be exchanged at the generous rate.
   ``The government went along with many of his suggestions and the
Bundesbank is now firmly in control of the monetary policy,''
Warren Oliver, an economist in London, said in a telephone
interview.
   East Germany surrendered its monetary sovereignty to the
Bundesbank.
   As guardian of the stability of the West German mark, one of the
world's most powerful currencies, Poehl was concerned about the
possible inflationary effect of giving East Germany's hungry
consumers 25 billion marks ($15.6 billion) overnight.
   Keeping inflation in check has been one of Poehl's primary jobs
since becoming president of the central bank in January 1980.
   Inflation is one of the worst economic ills to Germans because
the Weimar Republic's worthless currency contributed to the rise of
Adolf Hitler.
   Bundesbank autonomy is guaranteed by the constitution, but the
government chooses its president. The chancellor gave Poehl a
second eight-year term in 1987, even though the banker belongs to
the left-leaning Social Democratic Party, the opposition to Kohl's
center-right government.
   The central bank presidency is the best-paying government
position in Germany _ 600,000 marks a year, or $375,000.
   Some officials in the more conservative wing of Kohl's coalition
wanted Poehl replaced but could find no one with his experience and
international reputation.
   Analysts agree the strength of the mark would have suffered if
Poehl had not been reappointed.
   Poehl, 60 years old and slightly stocky, is the longest-serving
central bank chief in the seven leading industrialized nations and,
Oliver said, ``the most successful central banker of the last
decade.'' A word from Poehl is enough to move world financial
markets.
   From the sprawling Bundesbank headquarters on the outskirts of
Frankfurt, Poehl travels regularly to Washington and other world
capitals. He also is a ranking officer of the International
Monetary Fund.
   He was born Dec. 1, 1929, in Hanover, and earned an economics
degree in 1955. In seven years as an economics journalist for
several publications and radio stations, he built good personal
relations with important officials.
   After joining the Economics Ministry in 1970, Poehl became an
adviser to Chancellor Willy Brandt the next year and, in 1972, the
ministry's No. 2 man.
   While at the ministry, he played important roles in freeing
exchange rates and creating the European Monetary System. He joined
the Bundesbank as a vice president in 1977, three years before
becoming its chief.
   Insiders say Poehl is easygoing and relaxed at his job and once
prepared himself for the Washington heat by removing his tie and
socks in the plane. He is fluent in English, loves to play golf and
has a wit often laced with sarcasm.
   He is said to have told table companions at a Washington dinner:
``We'll probably have to feed Soviet soldiers now, but luckily
their living standard is lower than that of the Americanut 380,000 Soviet
soldiers are stationed in East
Germany.
   Oliver, the London economist, said Poehl was regarded as
``collegial, quite open. He is very co
soldiers.'' Abosmopolitan and is able to
tolerate differences of style.''
   ``Perhaps that comes from his journalistic background, and
journalists tend to go to him at big meetings because they know he
has something to say,'' Oliver added. ``The Bundesbank is very
successful in the public relations area.''
   Poehl endorses a common European currency and European central
bank in principle, but has expressed doubts whether governments are
ready to allow such a bank the necessary autonomy.
   Analysts say Poehl would be a perfect choice to head a European
central bank.

   Joyce Cutshall is consumed by a battle she
can never win. She thinks her daughter is dead, but can't prove it.
She suspects she is buried nearby, but can't find her.
   She wants to bring her home, but can't do it.
   She has made that her mission, taking the law into her own hands
to find out what happened to her child. Fearful that Jill's case
would sink deeper in police files, the determined mother who'd
never touched a legal book started a petition drive, forced a grand
jury probe, and prompted an arrest.
   Three years after Jill's disappearance, Joyce Cutshall believes
she's closer than ever to the truth _ a truth that will bring even
greater agony.
   ``I feel that this last chapter is going to be my absolutely
most difficult,'' she says. ``It's a very, very strange feeling to
work so hard toward something to know that at the end of it, it's
going to bring as much grief and pain as a mother can feel.''
   This fall, when David Phelps, 26, goes on trial on charges of
kidnapping Jill, Ms. Cutshall will be there, hoping his words will
lead to her daughter's body, knowing that even if she wins, she
loses. The prospect is frightening, yet comforting.
   ``Once I can put Jill to rest in my own mind and have a place
that I can go and visit her whenever I'm having a difficult day or
feel the need to see her,'' she says, ``that will help me deal with
the fact that I won't have a chance to hold her again.''
   For now, she lives with memories _ how Jill loved butter so much
she ate it off the stick. And mementos: pictures of horses and
hearts, a note to ``the greatest mom in the world,'' crayon
drawings of the sun, flowers and rainbows _ her symbol for the
future _ and poems.
   ``The world is a great round ball thing that is made by God,''
Jill wrote. ``It has good things on it and bad things on it. The
world is great to me.''
   On Aug. 13, 1987, 9-year-old Jillian Dee Cutshall vanished from
that world she so cherished.
   She disappeared in Norfolk, where she was spending the summer
with her father, Roger. The Cutshalls divorced in 1985; Jill and
her brother, Jeff, lived in Kansas with their mother.
   Jill, her mother says, feared staying in her father's apartment
house alone; it was seedy, noisy, filled with transients. So when
he and his new wife left for work at 6 a.m., she did her chores,
then walked to the baby sitter's six blocks away.
   That day, she was last seen at 6:30 a.m. on her sitter's stoop,
where she normally waited until someone inside awoke.
   Jill had been repeatedly warned about strangers. But the blonde,
blue-eyed youngster ``just loved people,'' her mother says. ``She
trusted them. She always found something good in everybody, even if
they weren't good.''
   After Jill's disappearance, the FBI, state and local police
blitzed the area. There were roadblocks, door-to-door searches,
hundreds of interviews. Tens of thousands of posters flooded the
country.
   At first, Ms. Cutshall thought she'd return in a week, then
months. ``After the third month,'' she says, ``I emotionally and
mentally was telling myself that if we work hard enough, we'll have
her back in a year.''
   A year passed. No Jill.
   Hope turned to heartache.
   Then in the fall of 1988, when Ms. Cutshall, 36, was attending a
local college, a journalism student, Gail Pedersen, interviewed her
for a story. Ms. Pedersen revealed police had questioned her
brother, David Phelps, about Jill.
   Phelps' sister, she says, told her: ```I'm not saying that he is
guilty or innocent'... (but) she felt that it was a possibility
that he in some way was connected to her disappearance.''
   Ms. Pedersen also claimed her brother sexually abused a little
girl when he was a teen.
   Phelps and a man once imprisoned for sexual assault, Kermit
Baumgartner, lived together in the same building as Roger Cutshall
the summer of 1987. Both reportedly met Jill then. Police had
interviewed both men.
   Roy Stephens, a private investigator on the case since the
beginning, pursued the lead, too, knowing his own secret _ a 1976
prison stint for burglary _ could be revealed and he could be
blackmailed.
   ``I've put everything on the line for Jill,'' says Stephens, who
last year made public his past, returning the detective's license
he falsely obtained.
   The burly, bearded investigtor believed his own history gave him
an edge _ ``I know both sides of the law,'' he says. In January
1989, Stephens drove Phelps to the wildlife refuge where a hunter
discovered Jill's clothes in late 1987.
   He handed him a shovel. He asked him to help find Jill.
   ``All he keeps saying is `I don't know anything,' '' Stephens
recalls. ``I keep saying, `You do.' ''
   Stephens, accompanied by a partner, says he then fired a gun in
the air. Frustration, he says, not a threat. He claims Phelps led
them to a nearby cemetery, dug in one spot, then told him he and
Baumgartner had taken Jill to the refuge and even described her
clothes and underwear.
   Stephens had Phelps repeat his statement to an Omaha TV crew he
had waiting nearby. The investigator says he didn't go to the
police, fearing they'd reject the information.
   In that interview, later broadcast on ``60 Minutes,'' Phelps
described how Kermit got a nervous Jill out of the car. ``Kermit
kept his hand on her mouth and started fondling her and stuff,'' he
said. ``I got real nervous and said, `Hey, let's get the hell out
of here.' And Kermit says, `Well then you take the car back into
town and I'll get back later.' And I left.''
   Baumgartner, who lives in California, has repeatedly denied
wrongdoing. He claims Phelps was trying to cover his tracks.
   When police questioned Phelps, he recanted, claiming his
statements were made under duress. No body, no confession, no
charges.
   David Phelps was a free man. He soon left town.
   So did Baumgartner, who'd also been questioned by authorities.
   ``I was empty,'' Ms. Cutshall recalls in hushed tones.
``Whatever there is inside of me that says ... `I need to fight. I
need to go on' _ that was gone.''
   She'd lost her faith, too, in the police.``There were major
screw-ups,'' she says.
   Norfolk Police Chief Bill Mizner disagrees, noting thousands of
hours were spent interviewing hundreds of people and pursuing leads
in several states.
   ``There was some outstanding police work done in this
investigation,'' he says. ``It is by far the longest, most in-depth
case that the police division here has ever faced (and) by far the
most frustrating case.''
   Last summer, when Mizner placed Jill's case on semi-active
status, Ms. Cutshall was outraged.
   ``If you cannot rely on people that you're supposed to be able
to rely on to do the job, I guess the old adage is ... `Do it
yourself.' ''

   She began.
   Ms. Cutshall discovered that under Nebraska law, authorities had
to convene a grand jury if presented with petitions from at least
10 percent of county voters participating in the last gubernatorial
election.
   In December, while others shopped for Christmas gifts, she
collected signatures. While the local mall was being decorated, she
was setting up a table and banner reading: `Jill Cutshall Needs A
Grand Jury.'
   A dozen volunteers gathered signatures at the mall and braved
blizzards to collect more in door-to-door visits. Petitions were
presented to authorities on Feb. 20 _ the day after Jill's birthday
_ ``my gift to her,'' her mother says.
   Authorities, she says, certified 1,471 signatures, hundreds more
than needed.
   Ms. Cutshall downplays her doggedness, saying: ``I don't have
anything extra. The only thing I have is the love for my daughter.''
   In June, a grand jury indicted Phelps on charges of abduction
with intent to commit sexual assault. Last month, he returned to
Nebraska from Iowa, and pleaded innocent. He's being held on
$100,000 bond.
   Baumgartner wasn't charged. Special prosecutor James Smith said
one problem was getting him back to Nebraska to testify before a
grand jury. He'd already made consistent statements to authorities.
``It's not as if they didn't know what the guy's story was
anyhow,'' Smith says.
   Stephens, who keeps a picture of Jill on his desk, says he won't
rest until he finds her. He heads investigations for the Missing
Youth Foundation, a non-profit group founded after Jill's
disappearance that boasts of having brought home 17 children since
January 1989.
   Ms. Cutshall, meanwhile, hopes the Nov. 5 trial will help her
and Jeff, 14, start over.
   Jeff, who saw himself as Jill's protector, has endured his own
hell with schoolmates' taunts of ``We know where your sister is.''
He even talked of suicide.
   For a year after Jill's disappearance, Joyce Cutshall wrote her
letters. Part of the first one seems prophetic.
   ``There is a part of me that is gone. I hope you are doing OK,
sweet pea,'' she wrote. ``I know you feel inside how special you
are to me. I could never ask for a better daughter than the one I'm
blessed with. If I can't find you soon, I'm afraid I'll never see
you again.''
   Three year later, Joyce Cutshall's heart still needs to convince
her head.
   ``I absolutely have to be able to have her in a place where I
can make that contact with her,'' she says. ``Until I can do this,
there's a chance she's still alive. That's my mother's side. She's
out there lost waiting to be found. I can't quit doing this until I
can find her and bring her back.''

   After 20 years of contentious litigation over
sickness and death caused by asbestos, a federal judge has taken
the first step toward a comprehensive solution to the nation's
biggest product liability issue.
   But several attorneys are questioning the viability of a single
plan to resolve tens of thousands of disparate lawsuits seeking
compensation for lung cancer and other respiratory ailiments caused
by asbestos.
   ``This litigation is too diffuse to expect that all parties and
all state courts will consent to a mandatory class action,'' said
Andrew Berry, a Newark, N.J., attorney representing several
defendants.
   In the first move toward a class action lawsuit, U.S. District
Judge Jack B. Weinstein on Monday ordered hearings to determine
whether Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. can settle 65,000 pending
claims in a single case.
   Weinstein also endorsed combining the Manville trust _ the
nation's largest asbestos claims resolution system _ with money
from other defendant companies into a national fund that would
apportion compensation on the basis of need.
   The action followed an unusual joint order Friday by 10 federal
judges from around the country who were frustrated by clogged court
dockets, mounting claims and resolution so slow that many asbestos
victims die before they are paid.
   ``We have got to pay these people who are entitled to be paid
and we have to reduce the costs,'' Weinstein told a crowded hearing
in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.
   Weinstein and the nine other federal judges approved a
three-tiered plan for resolving about 90,000 lawsuits pending in
state and federal courts nationwide.
   Thousands of new lawsuits are filed monthly and legal experts
estimate hundreds of thousands more cases will be made. Judges have
complained that legal costs are siphoning away two-thirds of the
money earmarked for victims.
   Under the plan, Weinstein would handle a class action involving
Eagle-Picher and up to five more companies that don't have the
money to fight cases in court or pay present and future claims.
Before the case can proceed, the court must determine the
defendants lack resources.
   Weinstein's case is expected to include the Manville trust,
which was formed in 1988, six years after Manville Corp. was forced
into bankruptcy court protection under the weight of asbestos
claims.
   In part two of the plan, Thomas D. Lambros, chief judge of
federal district for northern Ohio, would attempt to fashion a
single out-of-court settlement of asbestos claims.
   Finally, U.S. District Judge Robert Parker, chief judge of the
eastern federal district of Texas, would supervise a class-action
trial for defendants unwilling or unable to reach settlements.
   The movement to reform asbestos litigation gained momentum
earlier this year when the Manville trust announced it had run out
of money for new claimants and said others wouldn't get money until
well into the 21st century.
   Most claimants inhaled asbestos, which was used widely for
insulation, while working in shipyards and factories as long ago as
the 1930s.
   Judges complain that the same issues are argued over and over,
leading to millions in expenses that might otherwise be used to pay
victims. Frivolous claims, high fees charged by plaintiffs lawyers
and a refusal by some defendants to settle also have been
criticized.
   But some attorneys oppose the judges' plan, saying the issue is
too complex for a single national solution. They predicted a
breakdown in current settlement talks and time-consuming court
appeals that would further delay compensation payments
   ``If we don't have something available to the victims for the
next three, four, five years it takes to establish a national class
action, that would be a disaster to the victim,'' Gene Locks, a
Philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer, told Weinstein.
   In the Eagle-Picher case, Weinstein appointed former federal
judge Marvin E. Frankel to hold hearings on whether the company
lacks resources so it can qualify for a class action all plaintiffs
would be required to join.
   Weinstein, who devised a national settlement for Vietnam
War-related injuries from the defoliant Agent Orange, said hearings
would open Wednesday and promised they would conclude within three
weeks.
   ``I do not intend that in this court (victims) wait eight years
before they get (compensation),'' he said. ``This will not be a
Manville reorganization.''
   Eagle-Picher, based in Cincinnati, said in court papers it spent
$119.7 million on litigation last year and is being named in 2,000
new lawsuits a month.

   United Parcel Service of America, Inc.,
wasted no time letting customers know it was business as usual
after the Teamsters union announced its truck drivers and package
handlers had ratified a new, three-year contract.
   UPS account executives started calling or visiting the company's
1.1 million daily pickup customers Monday to tell them the news,
said UPS spokesman Ken Sternad. Delivery drivers will start handing
out notices to delivery customers today.
   A strike threat that had surfaced during the negotiations forced
UPS customers and competitors to come up with alternate delivery
plans, and Sternad said it was too early to determine what effect
that would have on business.
   ``We're going to offer the same service we always have, and
hopefully that will be enough to convince anybody that may have
held off during this period that they'll stay with us,'' he said.
   Some customers had begun shifting their business to the U.S.
Postal Service or Roadway Package System, Inc., of Pittsburgh,
UPS's two main ground-delivery competitors.
   Union members voted 65,463 to 53,091 in favor of the contract,
or 55 percent to 45 percent, Teamsters President William J.
McCarthy said Monday in a statement from union headquarters in
Washington.
   About 146,000 UPS workers nationwide are covered by the
contract, which is retroactive to Aug. 1.
   The contract includes a one-time $1,000 bonus to full-time
workers, hourly wage increases totalling $1.50 an hour over three
years and increased company contributions to health benefits.
   McCarthy did not say what provisions the union leadership found
inadequate. Repeated telephone calls to his office were not
returned.
   In his statement, McCarthy charged that Greenwich-based UPS
``went to unprecedented lengths'' to win ratification.
   ``In the final outcome, I believe that many of the company's
employees were frightened by management's ability to use permanent
replacement workers, or scabs, in the possible event of a strike,''
McCarthy said.
   UPS said last week that it did not plan to hire replacement
workers. Company spokesman Ken Sternad said he wouldn't comment on
McCarthy's assertions.
   ``The bottom line is we made what we felt was a good offer and
it was accepted,'' Sternad said. ``All the other words are
unnecessary.''
   Teamsters officials began counting ballots Friday, and UPS
officials spent the weekend awaiting results. The union had asked
for a 10-day extension to gather the ballots just before the old
contract expired July 31.
   The Teamsters had agreed Friday to go back to the bargaining
table if the contract was rejected, despite a threat of a
nationwide strike early in the negotiations, Sternad said.
   UPS, the world's largest package handler, delivers more than 10
million packages a day, and made 2.8 billion deliveries in 1989 for
$12.4 billion in revenue. It's total work force is 230,000.
   The contract will increase the hourly wage for the highest paid
workers from $16.10 an hour to $17.60 an hour by August 1992. The
contract also calls for a cost-of-living allowance of up to 20
cents an hour, per year, depending on inflation, Sternad said.
   Part-time workers, who start at $8 or $9 an hour, will also
receive an additional $1.50 hour over three years, Sternad said.
   Company contributions for health benefits and employees'
pensions will increase from an average of $8,300 a year for
full-time workers to an average of $10,500 during the life of the
contract, Sternad said.
   The proposal also includes the bonus, to be paid within the
first month of ratification, of $1,000 to full-timers and $500 to
part-timers, he said.
   Improvements to working conditions in the contract include
replacement of worn-out truck seats with more comfortable
air-suspension seats and easier-to-handle dollies.
   The contract affects only U.S. workers. UPS has 12,000 to 13,000
employees outside the United States, Sternad said.
   There has never been a national strike against UPS, which has
had a national Teamsters contract since 1979, but sporadic work
stoppages and strikes have occurred regionally.
   The latest and biggest was in 1976, when 18,000 workers in 15
Northeast states walked out for 13 weeks.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Rise, Industry Group Says Petroleum Reserves May Be

   The United States should be prepared to draw on
its emergency oil reserves even if oil-producing countries increase
their output during the Persian Gulf crisis, an industry official
said.
   The president of the American Petroleum Institute, Charles J.
DiBona, said Monday there is no immediate pressure to release the
stockpile, ``but that could change and we should be prepared to do
that.''
   The White House said late last week it had no plans to open the
reserve, which is in caverns in Louisiana and Texas. But DiBona
said the turmoil in the world oil markets ``is clearly the kind of
circumstance for which the oil reserve was designed.''
   Meanwhile, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, Prince
Bandar Bin Sultan, said members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries are planning a meeting to consider their
response to oil shortages since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Saudi Arabia, a key gulf producer, has indicated a willingness
to help,'' DiBona said. ``So has Venezuela. And to the extent they
do, they will largely make up the 4 million barrel per day
shortfall. However, no one can know at this point what the net
effect on world oil supplies will be.''
   The price for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
rose to $26.77 per 42-gallon barrel Monday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Trading was halted early because of a power
failure in lower Manhattan.
   Earlier, Bandar said the Saudis would like ``to have a stable
and predictable market for oil.''
   At the most recent OPEC meeting, which concluded in Geneva,
Switzerland, July 27, the 13 OPEC ministers raised the target price
$3 to $21 a barrel. They also agreed not to puncture the production
ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day until the end of the year.
   Earlier this year, the price declined to the low $16 range
partly because crude output by OPEC and other producers was
outpacing world demand. Prices began rising earlier this summer
after the cartel reached an agreement to restrain production. They
shot sharply higher after the invasion of Kuwait on speculation
that Iraq might attack other vital oil producers in the region,
such as Saudi Arabia.
   The emergency stockpile of oil, called the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, was established after the oil crises of the 1970s. It
contains some 590 million barrels of crude that could be
distributed at a rate of up to 3.5 million barrels per day,
according to the Energy Department.
   Robert C. Porter, a spokesman in Washington for the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve Program said it would take about two weeks for an
oil sale to be made once a presidential order came in.
   ``Right now, we are on a higher alert level,'' Porter said.
``The reserve is always on a stage of readiness, but when you get a
situation like this, you make sure you are ready, and we are.''
   A trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, Peter Beutel, said
the OPEC nations could make up for the shortfall without too much
difficulty, so he did not believe it was time to get into the
strategic reserve.
   DiBona also said the government could lessen the impact of
Mideast supply disruptions by opening up production at more
offshore oil fields.
   He called on the government to open the Point Arguello oilfield
off the California coast, which he said is sitting idle because
state officials have not given oil companies permission to deliver
their oil. The field could immediately produce 90,000 barrels per
day, but it has been kept on hold because of environmental
concerns, DiBona said.
   More crude also could be produced in Alaska if environmental
restrictions were lifted, he said.

   The Pentagon will be getting fewer high-tech
weapons of the sea _ the Seawolf submarine and the Arleigh Burke
destroyer _ in line with cuts ordered by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney.
   In an attempt to save $7 billion over the next four fiscal
years, Cheney ordered slowdowns in the production rates of the two
high-tech vessels on Monday.
   A slower production rate for the submarine will cut one ship and
some advance purchased material from next year's budget, resulting
in a savings of $1.8 billion.
   Plans had called for buying 10 of the submarines every three
years. Instead, the Pentagon will reduce the purchase to three
ships every two years, according to a statement released at the
Pentagon.
   Cheney ordered that only four destroyers be purchased every year
instead of five or six. That means the Pentagon will buy 16 ships
from fiscal 1991 through fiscal 1994, instead of the 25 originally
planned, for a savings of $5 billion.
   Overall, the changes in the two programs are designed to save
$2.2 billion in the budget that is now before Congress and $7
billion in the Pentagon's spending plan for the fiscal years 1991
through 1994, the Pentagon's statement said.
   The reductions can be made because of the lessened Soviet
threat, but the crisis in the Persian Gulf reveals the need for an
up-to-date Navy, the secretary said in a statement.
   ``There is little doubt that the recent events in the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe have altered the social and political
makeup of the world, and our ongoing planning assessments are based
on the increased prospects for reduced world tensions,'' Cheney
said. ``However, current events remind us of how fragile world
peace can be. Therefore, we continue to require a superior naval
force to maintain free and open use of the seas.''
   The review was one of several Cheney has ordered for most of the
Pentagon's major weapons programs, given the nation's budget woes.
Following a similar review of aircraft in April, the secretary
slashed his request for B-2 stealth bombers from 132 to 75.
   The statement said the Pentagon's original plan for the Seawolf
called for maintaining a force of 100 attack submarines, but that
``the size of the Navy's overall submarine force is still being
considered.''
   The submarines _ designed by the Newport News Shipbuilding Co.
of Virginia and Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in
Connecticut _ are slated to take the place of the service's Los
Angeles-class attack boats.
   The nuclear-powered sub had been devised to counter what the
Pentagon saw as the rapidly improving capabilities of the Soviet
Navy.
   The Burke-class destroyer is designed to operate in carrier
battle groups. It carries the Aegis radar and weapons systems,
which allow it to track and guide weapons to destroy multiple
targets at any one time.
   Cheney said purchasing fewer of the vessels will allow the
destroyer's fighting capabilities to be upgraded through improving
its electronics and anti-submarine weaponry.
   The changes will mean one less destroyer in fiscal 1991,
resulting in a net savings of $407 million, the statement said.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., has been highly critical in recent
months of the destroyer, which is built by Bath Iron Works of Bath,
Maine.
   Dingell, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, has questioned the
survivability of the ship and the Aegis system against missile
attack.
   Dingell has alleged that the Navy's contract with Bath is a
``procurement nightmare'' of fraud and abuse.
   The destroyer is called the Arleigh Burke class after the World
War II naval hero and former chief of naval operations.

or 1.90 percent, to close at 26,672.53.
   The benchmark index suffered a loss of 1,153.12 points, or 4.22
percent, Monday after Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced the
cancellation of his planned trip to the Middle East because of the
worsening Persian Gulf crisis.
   Traders attributed the rebound to gains in overseas markets,
especially New York. Bargain-hunting following Monday's plunge also
encouraged investors' buying.
   Despite the sharp upsurge today, traders remain cautious about
the market's direction.
   In currency dealings, the dollar traded in a narrow range before
closing at 149.90 yen, down 0.75 yen from Monday.

   G.L. McLeland figures he drove about a million
miles during his 33-year career as a traveling salesman, but he's
staying put this summer.
   ``I'm pulling in my oars for a little while,'' the retired
Oklahoma City man said. ``I had some trips planned, but now I'm
just going to sit and wait a month or two. See how things come
out.''
   Rising gas prices, falling stocks and the Middle East standoff
have led many would-be travelers to reconsider their vacation
plans, industry experts said Monday.
   ``Consumers are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said Diane
Polomski, a spokeswoman for American Express Travel Related
Services Inc. in New York. ``People still want to travel ... but
they are being more cautious now.''
   Travelers with reservations in Middle Eastern countries are
anxious about whether Iraq's Saddam Hussein will withdraw from
Kuwait or make a grab for more territory.
   And domestic tourists, afraid that the nation's economy might be
heading into a tailspin, are reluctantly considering whether their
leisure trips should take a back seat to necessities.
   ``No one's sure if this is a recession,'' said Suzanne Cook,
executive director of the U.S. Travel Data Center in Washington.
``(But) if consumers feel squeezed in terms of their financial
situation, they have to make some decisions.''
   At least in some U.S. regions, travel has been coming up short.
   Officials warned that the final results weren't in, but by the
end of June tourism was off at many popular destinations such as
the Grand Canyon, California's San Diego Zoo, Washington's
monuments and Cape Cod.
   ``If people are worried about their jobs or increasing costs,
they have to put that into their thinking when making travel
plans,'' said Deborah First, acting director of the Massachusetts
Office of Travel and Tourism.
   They also have to think about safety. That's why ticket agents
and tourism officials representing Greece, Israel and Turkey have
been receiving scores of calls from anxious travelers.
   ``They want to be reassured, but I don't know of any massive or
large-scale cancellations,'' said Harvey Cohen, deputy director of
the Israel Government Tour Office in New York.
   Similarly, Kamil Muren of Tusem Tours International said he had
received calls from clients leery of making trips to Turkey. But,
he said, reassurances have been enough to avert cancellations in
all but a few cases.
   Americans are loath to forgo their annual vacations. It's
perhaps for that reason that business has remained constant or
improved in some cases despite the softening economy and rising
travel costs.
   ``People are accustomed to traveling and they like it,'' said
Jerry Cheskie spokesman for the American Automobile Association in
Heathrow, Fla. ``They're more apt to postpone the purchase of
big-ticket items like TVs or refrigerators than travel plans.''
   People will cut their trips short, stay closer to home and forgo
luxury accommodations. But even fears of recession aren't likely to
keep them from hitting the open road this summer, tourism officials
said.
   Robert and Florice Cohagen plan to drive from their home in
Columbus, Ohio, to Houston to visit relatives.
   ``We'd rather not spend the extra money, but it isn't going to
stop us,'' said Cohagen, 72.``It might only be worse next year.''
   That's the kind of attitude recommended by Richard Rippe, chief
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   ``We will face for a time somewhat higher inflation as the oil
prices are reflected in wholesale and consumer goods,'' he said.
``(But) a massive shift to saving rather than spending ... would
only push the economy into a recession.''

<HEAD>Apple Consumption Reaches Record High Despite Alar Scare</HEAD>

   People ate more apples last year than ever
before despite bad publicity about chemicals used by growers and a
slight decline in overall consumption of fresh fruit, Agriculture
Department figures show.
   The department's Economic Research Service said that a large
crop and low prices combined to push per capita consumption of one
of America's favorite fruits to 21.6 pounds in 1989, up from 19.87
pounds the previous year.
   Twenty years earlier, the figures showed, per capita apple
consumption was just over 17 pounds. The low mark in the 20-year
records was 15.53 pounds in 1972.
   Apple growers feared the worst in March 1989, when the Natural
Resources Defense Council said that apples treated with Alar
increased the risk of cancer in children. Several school districts
banned apples. Apple growers responded with a media campaign.
   ``Bananas and apples continued to be the two most popular fresh
fruits in the United States,'' the Agriculture Department said.
``Banana consumption rose with heavier imports, while fresh apple
consumption reached a record 21.6 pounds due to the large crop and
lower retail prices.''
   Overall, fresh fruit consumption dropped 2 percent last year to
an average of 96.6 pounds per person. That included citrus and
non-citrus.
   ``Tighter domestic supplies of fresh market oranges caused an 18
percent drop in per capita fresh orange consumption from 1988's
15.4 pounds,'' the report said.
   ``Similarly, U.S. consumption of fresh lemons, tangelos and
tangerines declined to tighter supplies,'' it added. ``Lower
consumption of these commodities, combined with fresh orange
consumption, offset an increase in per capita consumption of fresh
grapefruit and limes.''
   For fresh citrus as a group, per capita use was a four-year low
of 24.4 pounds, down from more than 27.1 pounds in 1988.
   The per capita consumption of fresh non-citrus fruit rose to
72.1 pounds in 1989, up only 1 percent from 1988. Bananas, at 24.56
pounds per capita, edged apples in per capita use, but apples
showed a much sharper year-to-year gain.
   ``Increased use of fresh apples, bananas, cherries, kiwifruit,
mangoes, pears, pineapples and strawberries offset reduced
consumption of fresh grapes, nectarines, papayas, cranberries,
avocados, apricots, plums and prunes,'' the report said.
   Although not in the big league of some of the more popular
fruits, a few other records were set last year for per capita
consumption.
   Limes, for example, averaged 0.8 pound per capita, up from 0.68
in 1988, a record level, the report showed. Also, pineapples, at
1.95 pounds, and strawberries, 3.32 pounds, showed record per
capita consumption in 1989.

   The number of workers employed by farmers
showed a seasonal increase in July but was down about 8 percent
from a year ago, according to a new survey by the Agriculture
Department.
   A quarterly report said Monday the hired work force on farms was
estimated at 1,106,000 workers during the week of July 8-14, up
from 833,000 in April. But that was down from 1,197,000 in the work
force in July 1989.
   Those did not include 356,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. In April, those
totaled 203,000 workers, and in July 1989 they were estimated at
351,000.
   Weather was a factor. Showers and thunderstorms were widespread
during the July 8-14 survey week over much of the eastern half of
the nation, the report said. Heavy rains and flooding were common
in some areas.
   ``Winter wheat harvest was 77 percent complete, two percentage
points behind the five-year average,'' the report said. ``Harvest
was complete in Kansas and Oklahoma, and nearly complete in Texas.''
   The report also noted that during the July survey the peach
harvest continued ahead of normal in the Mississippi Delta and the
Southeast, while the tobacco harvest progressed in Georgia and
North Carolina.
   ``Melon harvest was active in the California San Joaquin
Valley,'' the report said. ``In Oregon, broccoli, lettuce and snap
bean harvests were under way in the Willamette Valley. Raspberry,
blueberry, cherry, peach and vegetable harvests were active in
Washington.''
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $5.30
per hour, up from $5.23 per hour a year earlier but below the
average of $5.54 in April, the report said.
   For workers hired by contractors, there was no national wage
rate available. However, workers in California were reported at
$5.82 per hour, compared with $6.59 in April and $5.80 a year
earlier in July 1989. Florida workers averaged $6.11 per hour,
compared with $5.93 in April and $5.55 a year earlier.

   The Agriculture Department has issued another
report about Africanized bees to assure people that the ``killer
bees'' of Hollywood lore have a sting no worse than ordinary
honeybees.
   A USDA scientist said that ``contrary to some people's
expectations'' the Africanized bee has less venom than the ordinary
U.S. honeybee. And the venom itself is no more potent.
   But Justin O. Schmidt of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said the Africanized bees rally quickly and use more stings
to repel an intruder.
   ``People should steer clear of their nests,'' he said. ``These
bees are extremely defensive when their nests are threatened.''
   Department officials have been warning that the Africanized
honeybees, which started migrating northward from Brazil years ago,
are expected to enter the United States from Mexico at any time.
   Schmidt works at the agency's bee research center in Tucson,
Ariz. He said the chance of someone being severely injured by
Africanized honeybees is far less than the chance of being hit by
lightning.

<HEAD>Brazilian Fuel Prices Rise 9 Percent
^Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decreed a 9
percent increase in fuel prices following a cutoff in oil purchases
from Iraq, Brazil's main foreign supplier, Brazil's leading TV
network reported.
   Officials and observers have said in recent days that the rising
price of oil on international markets caused by the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait had made a domestic increase inevitable.
   The pump price of gasoline rose from $2.13 a gallon to $2.32, TV
Globo said.
   The network said the price of pure alcohol fuel rose from $1.60
a gallon to $1.74, it said..
   Alcohol fuel is subsidized by the government so it is cheaper
for consumers than gasoline, though production costs are actually
twice as high. About 4.5 million Brazilian vehicles, roughly
one-third of the country's total, run on alcohol made from
domestically grown sugar cane.
   The retail price of diesel fuel, kerosene, and cooking gas also
went up, Globo reported.
   Iraq was Brazil's top oil supplier before this South American
giant adhered to U.N.-imposed sanctions, including a ban on
petroleum imports from Iraq.
   In 1989, Brazil bought $1.46 billion in crude oil from Iraq,
about 30 percent of total daily imports.
   This country produces 665,000 barrels of oil daily, about 60
percent of domestic needs.
   Monday's increase was the second this month. Fuel prices were
sharply raised and then frozen March 15, when President Fernando
Collor de Mello decreed an economic austerity plan.
   Inflation has dropped sharply since March, when prices soared 84
percent, but is still rising at a rate of about 10 percent a month.
   Economists say continued inflation combined with minimal price
increases for fuel had resulted in gasoline and alcohol being
underpriced by about 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively.

<HEAD>USAir Says It Will Lay Off 200 Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAOPOLIS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drop in business will force USAir Group
Inc. to furlough about 200 pilots by the end of the year and
consider laying off other employees, an airline spokeswoman said.
   Susan Young on Monday confirmed reports from the Air Line Pilots
Association that the Virginia-based carrier was planning the
cutbacks.
   ``I think it's safe to say that the airline's traffic and the
industry's traffic is flat,'' she said. ``We will not fly as much
new service as originally planned in view of the state of the
economy.''
   The pilots union told its members in a tape-recorded telephone
message that it learned of USAir's plans last week in Los Angeles
during a meeting with airline president Seth Schofield and other
airline executives.
   The message said Schofield told the pilots' Master Executive
Council that USAir foresees a further decline in traffic and higher
fuel prices.
   The vice chairman of ALPA's Master Executive Council, Chris
Beebe, urged the pilots to adhere exactly to the wording in their
contract and not to fly overtime.
   Ms. Young, at the company's offices in Arlington, Va.,
acknowledged that business is slow. USAir Group lost $113.1 million
in the first half of this year and has not posted a profit since
the second quarter of 1989.
   However, Ms. Young said the airline may have too many pilots for
its fleet. The excess could have resulted from ``older aircraft and
rescheduling of aircraft deliveries,'' she said.
   Twelve new jets had been scheduled for arrival this year, but
USAir delayed taking delivery in an unusual cost-cutting move. It
also has tried to save money by paying less overtime to maintenance
crews.
   Ms. Young said flight attendants and other unidentified employee
groups also may be subject to furloughs. She said she could not
elaborate on the number of workers involved or when they might be
laid off.
   USAir employs about 6,300 pilots, all of whom are members of the
ALPA, Ms. Young said. The carrier has 55,000 hourly and salaried
employees, about 12,000 of whom work in the Pittsburgh region.

<HEAD>Sales Edge Up For Second Straight Monthly Gain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Retail sales edged up a weak 0.1 percent in
July, their second straight monthly gain after three consecutive
declines, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales rose a seasonally adjusted
$149.5 billion last month, up from $149.4 billion in June.
   The department also revised upward, to 1.1 percent, the June
advance that originally was reported to have been just 0.5 percent.
It was the first gain since last January and followed declines of
0.1 percent in May, 1.0 percent in April and 0.4 percent in March.
Sales were unchanged in February.
   But the small July increase was certain to renew questions about
whether the consumer would continue to help fuel the economy, now
approaching the end of its eighth year of expansion.
   Retail sales represent about half of consumer spending, which
has been a driving force for the economy since the end of the
1981-82 recession. Overall, consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   There have been signs recently of consumer caution amid recent
reports of a weakening economy.
   To avoid a recession, the Bush administration and many
economists have urged the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy
by lowering interest rates. The Fed has held rates high to curb
inflation by slowing the economy.
   Sales of durable goods _ items expected to last more than three
years _ rose 0.3 percent. These big-ticket goods have been
particularly affected by the Fed's policies since they often are
financed through loans.
   Automobile sales were down 0.6 percent, offsetting a 0.6 percent
advance in June. Weakness in auto sales has been a major factor
contributing to the overall sluggishness of consumer spending this
year.
   Excluding autos, retail sales were up 0.3 percent.
   On the other hand, sales of building materials remained strong,
rising 3.9 percent on top of a 3.2 percent increase the previous
month.
   Home furnishing sales also rose, up 2.5 percent after a 1.4
percent decline in June.
   Non-durable goods were unchanged following a 1.5 percent gain in
June.
   Department store sales posted a 0.8 percent advance after an
even stronger 3.5 percent increase the previous month. Grocery
store sales were up 0.4 percent after a 0.7 percent advance in
June. Drug store sales climbed 0.6 percent after a 1.6 percent gain.
   But sales fell in three non-durable sectors. Gasoline station
purchases were off 0.3 percent after a 1.0 percent jump; clothing
sales were down 0.9 percent after a 2.1 percent increase, and sales
at restaurants and bars fell 0.4 percent after a 0.8 percent
advance.

<HEAD>American Reportedly Interested in Bidding on Midway Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speculation that American Airlines may
be interested in acquiring Midway Airlines has push Chicago-based
Midway's stock up almost 40 percent.
   Midway's stock jumped $2.125 a share to close at $9.625 a share
in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange Monday. Shares of
AMR Corp., American Airlines' parent, closed at $51.25 each on the
Big board, up 25 cents.
   Market watchers said there is speculation that Fort Worth-based
AMR is considering making a bid for the cash-strapped Midway.
   Quoting unnamed sources, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported
today that AMR recently hired Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. to advise it on
the possible acquisition of all or parts of Midway.
   Midway spokeswoman Sandra Allen said AMR has not approached
Midway, the nation's 13th largest carrier. American spokesman John
Hotard said the company does not comment on rumors.
   Midway's most valuable assets appear to be its 23 gates at
Midway Airport, in the shadow of the world's busiest airport,
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. O'Hare, which is the site
of American's second-largest hub, is overcrowded.
   Midway also has orders and options on 62 McDonnell Douglas
MD-80s for relatively quick delivery. American, the nation's
largest carrier, already operates the world's largest fleet of
MD-80s but likely could take on more scheduled for delivery in the
next two to three years.
   Midway has been reeling from the combination of its $250 million
acquisition last year of gates from Eastern Airlines, higher fuel
prices, continued low-fare competition in the Midwest-to-Florida
routes and the general weakness in domestic travel, analysts said.
   Last year Midway lost $20.7 million on record revenues of $493.5
million. In the first quarter of 1990, it lost another $22.9
million.

   Stock prices were mixed in early trading today
following Monday's rally and gains overseas.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 4.70 to
2,742.08 in the first half hour of trading.
   But in the broader market, advancing issues slightly outnumbered
declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange, with 503 up, 447
down and 483 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 17.19 million
shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock trading was reported to be near normal this morning
following Monday's curtailed session stemming from a power outage
in Manhattan's financial district.
   The American Stock Exchange, which was forced to halt trading
shortly after 1 p.m. EDT Monday, opened for business at the regular
time this morning. Brokerage houses whose operations also was
curtailed by the blackout reported their trading had returned to
normal.
   The NYSE was unaffected by the outage, which was caused by a
fire in a utility substation.
   The market received mixed signals on the economy this morning in
a government report. The Commerce Department said July retail sales
rose 0.1 percent, short of analysts' expectations. But the
department revised upward the sales figure for June to a 1.1
percent increase from 0.5 percent.
   Stock prices rose overseas today. The key index on the Tokyo
exchange closed 1.90 percent higher, while prices also were up in
midday European trading.
   Monday's rally followed an initial plunge in stock prices. The
rally was boosted by a late flurry of buying stemming from computer
programs linked to stock-index futures.
   On Monday, volume on the floor of the NYSE came to came to
122.82 million shares, down from 145.34 million in Friday's session.
   The NYSE's composite index rose 1.48 to 185.63. At the American

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca
confirmed today that the struggling automaker had talked with three
major European companies but added he didn't expect the discussions
to result in a full merger.
   Speculation in Europe and the United States suggested that
Italy's Fiat Group would buy a stake in Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S.
automaker. While Iacocca said no such equity arrangement is
imminent, he added that it is possible in the next decade.
   ``No, I wouldn't want to predict that today. Maybe in the year
2000,'' Iacocca said. ``Given the way things have evolved in the
last 20 years, you might see some giant mergers, but I doubt that.
I doubt any full merger talk.''
   Iacocca said Chrysler had talked with Renault of France, Volvo
of Sweden and Fiat, but he refused to give specifics.
   ``Everybody's talking to everybody,'' he said. ``I think over
time everybody's going to need some kind of affiliation or a
partnership.''
   The chairman answered questions as production of the redesigned
1991 minivans began at Chrysler's assembly plant here, across the
river from Detroit. Minivans account for a large portion of
Chrysler's profits.
   The company earned $71 million in the second quarter this year
but is expected to show a loss in the third quarter, largely
because minivan plants in Windsor and St. Louis, Mo., shut down for
a month to retool for new models.
   Chrysler has struggled this year with lagging sales and the loss
of four top executives, which prompted Icacocca to delay his own
retirement plans. During national contract talks, Chrysler
negotiators have floated the ideas of partial employee ownership,
as well as establishing a multi-company health care plan.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Mostly Lower, Turn Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
lower then turned mixed today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting forecasts for a continuation of beneficial crop weather
in the Midwest.
   Losses were limited, though, by buying linked to Monday's weekly
Agriculture Department crop-progress report, which showed the corn
and soybean crops still lagging well behind the normal pace.
   The report showed pods setting in 50 percent of the soybean crop
as of Sunday, compared with the average of 69 percent for that date.
   Corn kernels were forming in 29 percent of the corn crop
compared with a 58 percent norm, according to the USDA.
   Both crops remained in mostly good to excellent condition, but
traders increasingly are concerned about the possibility of frost
damage to late-maturing crops, analysts said.
   William Biedermann, research director with the commodities
brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill., predicted the
two-sided trading probably would limit the crop markets to only
slight movement today.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $2.75\ a
bushel; corn was } cent to 1\ cents lower with September at $2.44\
a bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent lower with September at $1.15{
a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 3\ cents higher with
August at $6.01{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .12 cent higher with August at
79.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with August at 90.05 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged
to .32 cent lower with August at 58 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher with August at 49
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on Monday.

<HEAD>Perez: Oil Production Levels Focus of OPEC Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MARY D'AMBROSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil-producing countries could
establish new pricing and production levels by the end of the week
if agreements are reached at an emergency OPEC meeting, President
Carlos Andres Perez said Tuesday.
   OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Venezuela plan to propose that
production be increased if necessary to avoid a world oil shortage,
Perez said at a press conference.
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are
planning an emergency session, but the date and location have yet
to be announced.
   President Bush, in a phone conversation with Perez on Monday,
repeated a plea for Venezuela to increase production by 500,000
barrels daily.
   But Venezuela, while eager to provide the extra oil, has been
holding out for an OPEC accord on how to replace the 4 million
barrels of oil production blocked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Venezuela normally sells about half its daily two-million barrel
production to the United States, representing about 11 percent of
America's oil supply.
   Many assume that Venezuela would also sell most of its
additional oil to the United States, but Perez has denied making a
specific agreement to do so. ``Our principal consumer is the United
States. We have an obligation to them. But we can't be the only
ones to give,'' Perez said.
   He said regular production of an extra 500,000 barrels could
damage machinery. Venezuela is seeking American investment to
expand its oil industry with an aim of producing 3.5 million
barrels daily.
   Analysts here estimate that the current world supply should hold
out another two to three months.
   Perez said that he and his foreign minister, Reinaldo Figueredo,
have been in daily contact with OPEC as well with presidents of
oil-producers Mexico and Ecuador.
   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other oil-producing countries are
against drastic price rises, arguing that they would ``suffer the
consequences (later),'' Perez said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell Tuesday in quiet European
trading. Gold prices were higher.
   Traders said the market will continue to be influenced by
fundamental between Iraq and the United States and its allies
unless there is a major military engagement between Iraq and the
United States and its allies.
   A dealer with a British bank in London said that so long as
there is no fresh news out of the Gulf, the dollar is likely to
continue falling.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 149.90 Japanese yen from
150.65 yen on Monday. Later in London, it fell to 149.45 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8930 from $1.8842 late
Monday. At midday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8837.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates included: 1.5685 West German marks, down from 1.5762; 1.3055
Swiss francs, down from 1.3160; 5.2695 French francs, down from
5.2915; 1.7675 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7753; 1,152.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,156.00, and 1.1452 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1475.
   Selected middday dollar rates in New York included: 1.5765
German marks; 1.3141 Swiss francs, 1,156.25 Italian lire and 1.1473
Canadian dollars.
   Gold continued its rally in Europe. Gold rose in London to a
late bid price of $410.25 a troy ounce, from $404.60 bid late
Monday. In Zurich, gold closed at $412.00 bid, up from $404.00 bid
late Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $13.13 to close at a bid $410.80.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.28 a
troy ounce, from $5.15 bid late Monday.

   Stocks and bonds fell while oil and gold climbed
today as traders refocused attention on turmoil in the Middle East
and sought to escape the effects of a serious Wall Street power
failure.
   But remnants remained of the freak Monday outage that waylaid
the nation's financial center and forced thousands of workers to
evacuate powerless skyscrapers on a sultry August afternoon.
   The Consolidated Edison utility said it could take days to
restore power to portions of the area in southern Manhattan blacked
out by a substation fire.
   The American Stock Exchange and New York commodities markets
reopened this morning. But hundreds of commercial customers,
including some major investment firms, were forced to scramble to
function with a semblance of normality. Some such as County Natwest
USA turned hotel rooms into makeshift trading desks.
   The outage also impeded the ability of some financial
information gathering services to transmit data on commodities
futures and options.
   But the financial world's main focus returned to its
preoccupation before the freak outage: Iraq's destabilizing
influence over world oil supplies.
   Stock and bond prices drifted lower and the Dow Jones industrial
average of 30 blue-chip stocks was down about 5 points to the 2,741
level around noontime. In oil trading, West Texas Intermediate
crude contracts for September jumped 77 cents to $27 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders called the rise a
reaction to signs that the effects of a cutoff of Kuwaiti and Iraqi
oil are beginning to be felt in the United States, which imports
half its oil.
   ``We're seeing indications that marginal imports might go
elsewhere or stay at home,'' said John Hill, a broker with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures in New York.
   Oil's rise continued to push up gold prices, which surged over
the $400 an ounce level Monday to a five-month high, a reflection
of anxiety over higher inflation. Gold traded at $411 an ounce in
London today, up from $404.60 late Monday.
   American Stock Exchange spokesman Bob Shabazian said power was
restored by late afternoon Monday and that trading resumed at the
normal 9:30 a.m. EDT opening today.
   He said two standby generators parked outside the Amex building
on flatbed tractor-trailers were ready to be tapped in case the
exchange suffered another outage.
   Shabazian also said the Amex was treating Monday as an official
trading day and had calculated closing prices for all listed
stocks, many of which continued to trade on other exchanges after
the Amex closed prematurely.
   Based on the recalculations, he said the Amex index fell 1.32
Monday to 338.00, vs. 338.14 when power failed shortly after 1 p.m.
Monday. Volume for the day totaled 9.75 million shares, vs. a
normal full day of about 14 million.
   Closing prices are important in securities and commodities
trading because investors place buy or sell orders based partly on
what the previous day's price is.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, trading resumed 30 minutes
late this morning for gold and silver. On the New York Mercantile
Exchange, trading resumed about two hours later than normal.
   Unlike the Amex, the Comex and Mercantile Exchange were treating
today's trading as a continuation of the Monday session, and based
opening prices on Friday's close. Unfilled orders at the time power
failed were deleted.
   The disruptions in trading caused by the fire at a Con Edison
power substation added to the pressure bearing on the markets since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2. Oil prices were rising sharply
when trading shut down on the New York Merc, a key market for
petroleum.
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.20 points Monday to
2,746.78, but the broader market for stocks was mixed and trading
was light because of the power outage.
   In Tokyo and London this morning, stock prices rose while the
dollar was mixed.

<HEAD>Mobil Agrees to Buy Australian Gas Stations, Refineries from Exxon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp. has agreed to buy an Australian
gasoline station network and the stake it doesn't already own in
two refineries there from Exxon Corp., the companies said.
   Terms of the deal, which was announced late Monday, were not
disclosed, but published reports have said the price was about $400
million.
   A spokesman for Mobil said from Fairfax, Va., that he could not
comment on the value of the deal. Exxon, based in New York, also
declined comment on the sale price.
   Mobil said it had agreed to buy the network of about 300 service
stations and 90 fuel distributors owned by Exxon's Esso Australia
Ltd. subsidiary as well as Esso's minority share of an Esso-Mobil
joint venture that operates two refineries. The deal also includes
an ocean-going petroleum products tanker and Allen Bros. Asphalt
Ltd., a road sealing business.
   Allen E. Murray, Mobil's chairman and chief executive, said the
purchase ``will advance our strategy of increasing strength in the
world's fastest growing market for petroleum products.''
   Exxon, on the other hand, said it accepted Mobil's proposal
because it offered ``a unique opportunity compared with the value
of the ongoing business.''
   The sale does not involve any of Esso's crude oil and gas
exploration and production interests in Australia nor its interests
in the coal, minerals, shale oil or chemical industries.
   Exxon said its Esso unit will continue to be Australia's largest
oil and gas production operator.
   Mobil said the acquisition will boost its market share in
Australia to more than 20 percent from 14 percent. Mobil already
owns a 700-unit network of gas stations there.
   The sale is expected to close toward the end of the year pending
approval by Australian regulators and the completion of definitive
contracts.
   The Mobil-Esso joint venture is Petroleum Refineries (Australia)
Proprietary Ltd., which operates refineries with a capacity of
120,000 barrels a day in Altona and 65,000 barrels a day in
Adelaide.
   Mobil Oil Australia owns 65 percent of the venture, while Esso
Australia owns the remaining 35 percent.

<HEAD>Penney Profits Fall, Limited's Rise in Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Weakened consumer demand helped push J.C. Penney Co.'s profits
down 15 percent in the second quarter, but specialty retailer
Limited Inc. posted a 24 percent gain during the period, the
companies reported Tuesday.
   Dallas-based Penney said net income in the 13-week period ended
July 28 totaled $83 million, or 63 cents per share, down from $98
million, or 74 cents per share in the same period in 1989.
   Revenue rose 4 percent to $3.83 billion, from $3.67 billion a
year earlier. Penney Chairman William R. Howell blamed the profit
decline on a ``relatively low level of overall consumer demand,''
which he said has had a particularly negative impact on the
company's sales in the Southeast and Midwest.
   He noted that as Penney adjusts its merchandise mix, the
retailer is ``temporarily giving up some volume in conservative
women's sportswear.'' Without the economic slowdown, Howell said,
``neither the refining of our merchandise mix nor the costs
associated with the development of new specialty businesses would
be particularly felt.''
   For the year's first half, Penney said net income rose 5 percent
to $237 million, or $1.84 per share, from $226 million, or $1.71
per share. In 1989, the company recorded an after-tax charge of $20
million for the discontinuation of its interactive television
shopping service.
   Revenue for the first 26 weeks amounted to $7.11 billion, up 5
percent from $6.78 billion in the first half of 1989.
   The Limited Inc., based in Columbus, Oh., reported net income
for the period ended July 28 of $79 million, or 22 cents a share,
up from $63.8 million, or 18 cents a share a year earlier.
   The company said net sales increased 17 percent to $1.16 billion
from $990 million in the year-ago period.
   Limited Chairman and Chief Executive Leslie H. Wexner credited
the Victoria's Secret and Express units for their contribution to
the company's results at a time of ``economic uncertainty.''
   For the first half, net income totaled $141.34 milion, or 39
cents a share, up 21 percent from $178.97 million, or 30 cents a
share in the first half of 1989. Net sales during the period rose
16 percent to $2.26 billion, from $1.95 billion a year earlier.
   Limited, which owns Limited, Express, Victoria's Secret, Henri
Bendel, Lane Bryant, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, among others, operates
3,290 specialty apparel stores.

<HEAD>Cable TV Giant Reports Smaller Loss in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications Inc., the cable TV and theater
giant, said Tuesday its loss narrowed in the second quarter
compared with a year ago while its revenue and operating income
rose.
   The nation's largest cable television system operator said it
lost $44 million, or 12 cents a share, in the three months ended
June 30 compared with a loss of $64 million, or 18 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 22 percent to $890 million from
$726 million a year earlier.
   Operating income rose 21 percent to $173 million in the quarter
from $143 million a year earlier.
   For the first six months, Tele-Communications said it lost $101
million, or 29 cents per share, compared with a loss of $115
million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 26.8 percent to $1.75 billion for the six months
from $1.38 billion over the same period last year.
   It said revenue from its cable TV operations climbed 33 percent
for the first half due to a combination of higher subscriber
levels, higher prices and system acquisitions.
   TCI provided basic cable TV services to about 8.3 million
subscribers and pay-TV services to 6 million subscribers as of June
30.
   Revenue from its theater operations rose by about 4 percent,
mostly because of increases in ticket prices.
   The company said its purchase of TCI-Cooke Systems, the purchase
of a 42.5 percent indirect interest in SCI Holdings Inc. and a
business deal involving United Artists Communications Inc. and the
United Cable Television Corp. depressed its latest results.
   TCI also announced that it has arranged $200 million in longterm
financing for a wholly owned subsidiary with a group of major
insurance companies, led by The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
   The borrower, TCI Northeast Inc., serves about 815,000 base
subscribers in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. It is based in
Pittsburgh.

   Stock prices moved higher today in moderate
trading, erasing earlier losses and resuming a rally that began
Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 7.43 points
to 2,754.21 as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Earlier, the Dow was down
by as much as 16 points.
   In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining
ones by about 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 774 up,
631 down and 512 unchanged.
   Stock trading was reported to be near normal today following
Monday's curtailed session stemming from a power outage in
Manhattan's financial district.
   The American Stock Exchange, which was forced to halt trading
shortly after 1 p.m. EDT Monday, opened for business at the regular
time. Most major brokerage houses whose operations were curtailed
by the blackout reported their trading had returned to normal, but
some still were operating with limited phone lines or in makeshift
offices.
   The NYSE was unaffected by the outage, which was caused by a
fire in a utility company substation.
   The market received mixed signals on the economy this morning in
a government report. The Commerce Department said July retail sales
rose 0.1 percent, short of analysts' expectations. But the
department revised upward the sales figure for June to a 1.1
percent increase from 0.5 percent.
   Stock prices rose overseas today. The key index on the Tokyo
exchange closed 1.90 percent higher, while prices also advanced in
London.
   Among most-active blue chip issues today, Philip Morris rose \
to 46}, IBM was up 1 at 104{, Eastman Kodak fell \ to 43\, Boeing

   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares was up
0.57 at 186.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 339.04, up 1.04.
   Monday's rally sent the Dow more than 30 points higher. It was
boosted by a late flurry of buying stemming from computer programs
linked to stock-index futures.

<HEAD>Government Takes up Sparkler Dumping Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has agreed to investigate
charges that imported Chinese sparklers are being sold in the
United States at less than fair value.
   The International Trade Commission said it ruled 4-0 Monday that
there is reason to believe the Chinese imports theaten material
damage to the domestic sparkler industry. That means the Commerce
Department will open an anti-dumping investigation and hold
hearings.
   The department's preliminary findings, due by Dec. 10, could
lead to possible import duties on the Chinese sparklers equal to
the amount of underpricing deemed unfair, the commission said.
   Two of the three U.S. sparkler makers, Elkton Sparkler Co. of
North East, Md., and Diamond Sparkler Co. of Youngstown, Ohio,
petitioned for the investigation.
   Government figures show that starting in 1988, Chinese imports
captured more than half of the U.S. market.
   American companies made 148,000 sparklers and had 53.5 percent
of the market in 1987, compared to 94,000 sparklers and 42.2
percent in 1989, the commission said. The Chinese market share rose
from 46.1 percent in 1987 to 57.3 last year, while total usage
dropped from 258,000 to 213,000, it said.

   Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., the giant investment bank
and brokerage, said Tuesday it would install a pair of executives
to replace John L. Weinberg when he steps down later this year as
senior partner and chairman.
   Weinberg, 65, disclosed Tuesday he plans to retire after 14
years as senior partner and chairman of the management committee at
the end of the firm's fiscal year Nov. 30.
   The firm said its co-vice chairmen for the past three years,
Robert E. Rubin and Stephen Friedman, will share Weinberg's titles
after he retires.
   Naming a pair of executives to head a firm is becoming more
common as the complexity of running businesses has escalated.
   The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, for instance, named co-chief
executives, William A. Grant and Robert J. Kelly, after the merger
of the firms Arthur Young &amp; Co. and Ernst &amp; Whinney last year.
   The media and entertainment giant Time Warner Inc. also is run
by co-chief executives, Steven J. Ross and Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr.
The company was created in a merger earlier this year of Time Inc.
and Warner Communications Inc.
   Weinberg shared the job of chairman of the management committee
when he was appointed to it in 1976 with John C. Whitehead.
   Weinberg has been the sole chairman since November 1984 after
Whitehead retired and later became deputy secretary of state.
   Goldman Sachs is one of the last major privately held investment
firms on Wall Street and has about 6,400 employees worldwide.
   It ranked third among investment firms behind Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. and Shearson Lehman Brothers in terms of capital at the start
of the year, according to the Securities Industry Association.
   The firm has established a solid reputation in mergers and
acquisitions, equity underwriting, corporate advisory services,
trading and research.
   Weinberg cited both the pressures of the job and his desire to
pursue private interests as reasons for his decision to step down
from a post he called ``the greatest job in the world.''
   The senior partner's position ``is a seven days a week, 52 weeks
a year responsibility and it requires a total commitment. The
pressures are often very intense,'' he said in a statement.
   Weinberg said the firm is in excellent condition with a strong
capital position and earnings running somewhat ahead of last year's
results. He said its prospects for growth and development were
bright.
   During his tenure at the top of the firm, Weinberg said its
annual profits rose about tenfold and its equity capital grew to
$2.3 billion from about $80 million at the end of 1976.
   Weinberg will continue as senior chairman of the firm,
responsible for client relationships and other unspecified
activities.
   In a joint statement, Rubin and Friedman said they ``look
forward to continuing on the course that we have set and followed
together.''
   Weinberg joined Goldman Sachs in 1950 and became a partner in
1956. He was named senior partner and co-chairman of the management
committee in 1976.
   Rubin, 51, joined Goldman Sachs in 1966, became a partner in
1971 and a member of the management committee in 1980. He formerly
headed the trading and arbitrage division and previously oversaw
the firm's commodity and foreign exchange subsidiary.
   Friedman, 52, also joined Goldman Sachs in 1966, was elected
partner in 1973 and became a member of the management committee in
1982. He headed the mergers and acquisitions division for several
years and had been co-head of the investment banking division.
   Rubin and Friedman served as co-heads of the fixed income
division from 1985-88 and have been vice chairmen of the firm since
1987.

   President Bush temporarily turned his
attention Tuesday to work on a budget compromise. White House aides
say the disagreement with Congress is becoming more urgent because
of the Mideast crisis.
   The president interrupted his Maine vacation for two days of
Washington work focused on the huge U.S. effort to punish Iraq for
its invasion of Kuwait. His first order of business was a meeting
with advisers on how the crisis could hurt the economy and the
budget.
   Bush turned away reporters' questions during a photo session at
the start of his budget meeting. The president was joined by his
chief of staff, John Sununu, and economic adviser Michael Boskin,
but Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and budget director Richard
Darman did not attend.
   The rapid increase in oil prices sparked by the Iraqi aggression
has the potential of tripping up an already weak economy. And
maintaining the huge U.S. force in Saudi Arabia could add billions
of dollars to the Pentagon's annual budget.
   Brady, while not predicting a recession, has said the slow
growth rate of the American economy could fall ``closer to zero''
as the higher oil prices take full effect.
   Brady decided not to interrupt his own trip to take part in the
talks. Brady, a key member of the budget team, was in the Midwest
on a two-day campaign swing for Republican candidates.
   Meanwhile, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said,
``We think it's even more important that we reach an agreement now
because there needs to be a unity of purpose in this country, not
only about the conflict in the gulf, but also about our spending
issues and about where the budget is going.''
   One of the many sticking points in the budget talks, which are
nearly four months old, is the level of military spending. Bush
requested $303 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, but the
Senate has approved only $289 billion and the House Armed Services
Committee has endorsed a $283 billion budget.
   The White House and congressional conservatives plan to use Iraq
as an argument for a larger military budget. The budget talks will
resume next month, when Congress returns from its summer recess.
   Bush has repeatedly expressed his frustration with the talks,
which he initiated in May. The two sides are nowhere near an
agreement despite Bush's ending his ``no new taxes'' campaign
pledge.
   Bush and the Republicans have been criticized for suggesting
higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and a proposal to limit the
income tax deduction for state and local taxes. The Democrats,
meanwhile, refrained from putting forward any substantive budget
proposals until after the recess.
   The president last week indicated he would step up his
rhetorical attacks on the Democrats, but refrained at the time
because it coincided with his ordering of U.S. troops to the Middle
East.
   The goal of the talks is to reduce the federal deficit at least
$50 billion in fiscal 1991, more than has been accomplished in any
previous budget pact.
   Even if that were accomplished, the spending plan would not meet
the mandate of the Gramm-Rudman budget law. That law calls for a
fiscal 1991 deficit no higher than $64 billion.
   According to the latest administration estimates, the deficit
next year will be about $169 billion, not counting the $60 billion
or more needed to continue the bailout of the savings and loan
industry.
   If a budget agreement is reached, the legislation would stretch
out Gramm-Rudman's timetable for a balanced budget. Instead of
keeping that goal in sight for fiscal 1993, it would be postponed
until fiscal 1995 or later.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rise, Led By Soybeans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely erasing the
previous day's losses in a rally led by the soybean complex.
   Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s trading-floor
operations at the exchange, said the runup mostly reflected
large-scale buying that appeared to have originated with a single
speculator in the soybean market.
   Zusel could account for no change in supply-and-demand factors
that might have prompted the buying.
   But other analysts said soybeans were supported by indications
that Spain bought Brazilian soybeans overnight and by prospects for
sales of U.S. soybeans to Taiwan and South Korea.
   A drop in supplies of soybeans certified deliverable against the
August contract also boosted the soybean market, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 3 cents to 4\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.79{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1\ cents higher with September at $2.45\ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to { cent lower with September at $1.16 a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 9 cents higher with August at
$6.10 a bushel.

   Stock prices closed slightly higher today in
moderate trading, erasing earlier losses on favorable news from the
Mideast.
   Jon Groveman, head of equity trading for the New York brokerage
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co., said the market rallied on the news that
Jordan's King Hussein was on his way to the United States to confer
with President Bush over the Iraqi situation.
   ``We've been inundated with negative headlines. With the market
oversold like this, people are looking for an excuse to buy,''
Groveman said.
   Analysts also said the stock market was boosted by gains in the
bond market and a drop in oil futures prices, also due to Hussein's
trip and the lack of any fresh bad news from the Middle East.
   The markets received mixed signals on the economy this morning
in a government report. The Commerce Department said July retail
sales rose 0.1 percent, short of analysts' expectations. But the
department revised upward the sales figure for June to a 1.1
percent increase from 0.5 percent.
   Stock trading was reported to be near normal today following
Monday's curtailed session that stemmed from a power outage in
Manhattan's financial district.
   The American Stock Exchange, which was forced to halt trading
shortly after 1 p.m. EDT Monday, opened for business at the regular
time. Most major brokerage houses whose operations were curtailed
by the blackout reported their trading had returned to normal, but
some still were operating with limited phone lines or in makeshift
offices.
   The NYSE was unaffected by the outage, which was caused by a
fire in a utility company substation.

<HEAD>UAW Votes on Tentative Contract at Flint Parts Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead planned after vote is announced. Voting was to begin at

   United Auto Workers union members in Flint voted
Tuesday on a proposed contract with General Motors Corp., which has
been forced to idle several other plants because of labor unrest at
Flint.
   The tentative contract was reached Monday afternoon, the fifth
day of a strike called over local health and safety matters, work
speedups and the use of outside companies to perform work that
unionized GM employees could do.
   Voting at UAW Local 659 began Tuesday afternoon. Details of the
tentative agreement covering about 2,800 people weren't announced
before the voting.
   The strike at Flint has affected other GM plants because of the
company's reliance on ``just-in-time'' distribution, a system that
delivers parts and components to assembly plants frequently within
hours of them being installed in new vehicles.
   By Tuesday, the Flint strike had shut down five assembly plants
in Michigan, Ohio and Louisiana, and portions of some component
factories, resulting in at least 17,000 layoffs.
   ``We could certainly see additional impact this week,'' GM
spokesman John Maciarz said Tuesday.
   Tuesday's vote comes as the UAW negotiates national contracts
with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., to replace agreements
that expire Sept. 14. The agreements cover more than 450,000
workers, including about 300,000 GM employees.
   It is unusual for the UAW to begin a local strike during
national contract talks. Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the
University of California at San Diego, said the selective strike
may be a preview of the union's strategy later on.
   Analysts also say the Flint strike sends a strong indication
that the UAW will choose to concentrate its national negotiating
efforts at GM. Under an arrangement known as pattern bargaining, an
agreement reached at the target company is then presented to the
other two of the Big Three automakers for minor customizing before
being put up for ratification.
   ``If GM weren't going to be the target, it wouldn't make much
sense to have this demonstration strike at GM,'' Shaiken said.
