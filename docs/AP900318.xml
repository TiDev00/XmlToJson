<TEXT>
   The Caribbean moon casts a silvery
light that is kind to the shabby streets and crooked docks of this
steamy port town on the Miskito Coast.
   The doctors who set Bluefields' broken bones and deliver its
babies gather on a porch, catching the breeze, catching their
breath, waiting for dinner.
   They are the Cuban medical brigade, 15 idealistic envoys of a
revolution becoming isolated and stale because of changes sweeping
the rest of the communist world.
   Suddenly, they don't know where they stand.
   Change has hit Nicaragua, ousting President Daniel Ortega's
leftist Sandinistas, one of Cuba's only remaining allies. Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro's new government will be conservative and
pro-American.
   Will it ask them to stay? Will Cuban President Fidel Castro let
them remain to taste post-revolutionary democracy?
   The story of the doctors and their compatriots in a 300-strong
construction brigade here is a story of a community in need,
hard-won acceptance, and the vagaries of politics.
   It began a decade ago, when Bluefields was torn by anti-Cuban
riots. Today, many Bluefilenos dread the Cubans' departure.
   It would strip Nicaragua's isolated south Atlantic coast of its
only surgeons, anesthesiologists, obstetricians and orthopedist.
   It would shatter the vision of a thousand sturdy new homes
replacing shacks flattened by Hurricane Joan in 1988.
   ``It would be chaos,'' said Dr. Donald Weil, the Nicaraguan
director of the Sandino Regional Hospital, where more than half the
staff is Cuban.
   A few blocks away, the Cuban doctors gather around their
communal dinner table, talking about work, about home, about what
lies ahead.
   ``We'll be here as long as they want us,'' says Dr. Ernesto Diaz
Trujillo, a 40-year-old intensive care specialist who is 11 months
into his two-year tour.
   Bluefields got a taste of life without the Cubans when they
stayed home in the tense days after the Feb. 25 election.
   ``They didn't want to come out on the street because they didn't
know what would be happening,'' said Johnny Hodgson, a local
Sandinista official.
   Things fell apart at the 118-bed hospital, which has only 12
Nicaraguan doctors. Some patients had to be sent to Managua, 190
miles west and reachable only by plane or boat. Most just had to
wait.
   ``We couldn't handle it,'' Dr. Weil said.
   After two days, community leaders went to the Cubans and
persuaded them to return to work, reassuring them they were not
only safe, but desperately needed.
   The experience converted all but the most fervent
anti-communists in Bluefields, Weil said. ``People changed colors
like chameleons.''
   Back at the Cuban residence, the table falls silent as the
brigade's orthopedic surgeon shouts into the telephone, reassuring
his mother back home in Cuba.
   ``No problems,'' he yells, jamming the receiver into one ear and
his finger into the other so he can hear. ``Absolutely no
problems.''
   Their voices crossed only 800 miles, but it might as well have
been 800,000.
   Nicaragua's Atlantic coast _ an enclave of mestizos, Miskito
Indians, the descendants of British pirates and of African slaves _
is a universe away from both Havana and Managua.
   Anti-communism runs deep, a legacy of the region's ties to the
Yankees who mined its gold, cut its lumber, fished its waters, and
to the missionary fervor of the Moravians and the Capuchin priests
who educated its children.
   ``I remember when I was studying in secondary school, we had to
pray after every class,'' Hodgson recalled with a laugh. ``And if
you didn't mention Cuba and communism in your prayers, it was as if
you were not praying.''
   Acceptance was a long time in coming for the Cubans, who began
arriving in Nicaragua soon after the 1979 revolution.
   The people of the coast resented the Cuban teachers and their
highly political curriculum.
   In September, 1980, anti-Cuban riots erupted when the government
announced plans to send in more teachers. Thousands of people,
mostly blacks, took to the streets.
   The government sent in the army to put down the riots, arrested
hundreds of people and accused Bluefields of trying to launch a
separatist movement.
   The teachers were eventually withdrawn; the doctors stayed,
nearly irreplaceable because of the shortage of physicians in
Nicaragua.
   But it took the fury of a Hurricane Joan on Oct. 21, 1988, to
bridge the gulf between Bluefields and Castro's envoys.
   It was Cuba that arrived first with aid and was most generous.
When Bluefilenos gathered the boards of 5,000 homes, scattered like
matchsticks by 135 mph winds, there were Cubans by their side.
   The construction brigade has put up more than 100 of a planned
1,000 sturdy, prefabricated homes. The first residents began moving
late last year into what is now the best neighborhood in town.
   ``This is the first time, with the construction of these houses,
that the people of Bluefields really live with the Cubans, you
know, walk with them and pass the whole day with them,'' Hodgson
said.
   The construction brigade lives in a Cuban-built complex that
will become a university after they leave. There are touches of
home such as Cuban cigars, cigarettes and coffee.
   ``All of them has a girlfriend or boyfriend. They are
courting,'' said Marvin Taylor, a local politician.
   At the former British diplomatic mission where the doctors live,
dinner is over. The doctors head back to the porch, to the rocking
chairs under the sign, to the lazy moonlight.
   Trujillo lingers for a moment, making a point about people and
politics, about isolation and coexistence.
   ``If I drink red wine and you drink white,'' he says, holding a
glass high, ``there is no reason we can't toast.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has once again shaken up the
Soviet political system, this time to give himself even more power
as the country's first Western-style president.
   But as Lithuania leads other small republics toward independence
and Russia itself contemplates electing a chief executive, the
question down the road for Gorbachev is: president of what?
   The Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet Parliament,
grumbled and complained more than usual, but Thursday acknowledged
Gorbachev as the political master from Poland to the Bering Strait
and Iran to the Arctic Circle. The area includes more than 100
nationalities and almost 300 million people.
   Gorbachev's moves early this year leading to his election
appeared to complete a revolution of the political structure that
even he until recently did not expect.
   In December he fought Andrei D. Sakharov to prevent the
parliament from eliminating the Communist Party's guarantee of
power, but two months later he led the fight to end it.
   His close Politburo adviser Alexander N. Yakovlev told an
official newspaper that Gorbachev opposed a presidential form of
government, and only recently came to believe it was needed to hold
his country together.
   Gorbachev told parliament he intends to be president of all the
people, including 3.7 million Lithuanians, whose leaders hastily
declared independence before Gorbachev could gain his new powers.
   ``Our country is living through difficult times. But if we act
energetically and as a team, we certainly will be able to overcome
the difficulties,'' he said. ``The Russian people and all the
peoples united with it in a great multinational state will succeed
in reviving their common homeland, and will surely achieve that on
the road of perestroika and socialist renewal.''
   But his dealings with the wayward republics give little grounds
for such optimism.
   When it declared independence, Lithuania changed its Soviet name
and emblem, and activists report that one-third of its 15,000
potential draftees refused to show up this year for service in the
Soviet Army. It announced plans to start setting up border
checkpoints.
   On Friday, Gorbachev gave Lithuania until Monday to answer a
parliament proclamation that the declaration of independence was
invalid.
   Even as he assumed new powers that do not exclude direct
presidential rule of an area, he was faced with the Lithuanian
contagion spreading.
   ``The Soviet Union will have its president, and Estonia will
move toward independence,'' said Endel Lippmaa, a leading deputy
from the Lithuania's fellow Baltic republic of 1.6 million people.
   An unofficial Estonian Congress demanded that the Kremlin name
the time that it would pull its soldiers out. Estonian government
officials said they agreed.
   Latvia, the third Baltic republic, also is pushing for
independence, and the Caucasus republic Georgia has demanded
negotiations about restoring independence. Moldavians are looking
more closely across the border to their ethnic brothers in Romania
after the revolution there. Armenia and Azerbaijan, locked in a
bloody territorial dispute, share a mutual antipathy for Gorbachev.
   All those republics make up only about 10 percent of the
country's population. They were collected by the czarist empire,
which broke up after the Bolshevik Revolution and then gradually
gathered again by the Soviet Union. The Baltics were independent
countries between the world wars and were the last to join the
Soviet Union. They were absorbed by Josef Stalin in 1940.
   Central Asia, home to about one in five Soviets, increasingly
has been wracked by ethnic violence, but so far there has been
little talk of secession.
   But the long-slumbering Slavic heartland of Russia, the Ukraine
and Byelorussia is showing signs of waking up.
   The three republics, which contain more than two-thirds of the
country's people, held local elections March 4. Run-offs were
required in most districts, but progressives appeared to do well,
perhaps presaging drives for autonomy similar to those gripping the
smaller republics.
   But the Rukh movement has gained a foothold in the Ukraine with
its demands for more autonomy, and there are appeals for outright
independence for the second-most populous republic.
   In Russia, nationalists say that it is the Russians themselves
who have suffered the most from Soviet rule. Unlike other
republics, Russia does not have its own capital, its own hymn or
its own Communist Party structure. Nationalists are pressing people
to think of themselves as Russians rather than Soviets.
   The Russian federation, by far the largest republic, already has
decided to elect its own president. One of the announced candidates
for the job is Gorbachev's populist nemesis, Boris N. Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin has nationwide popularity, and nationwide ambition. He
said in Italy earlier this month that he would like to be Soviet
president, if there were a popular vote.
   While Gorbachev has paid a price in popularity for his
leadership over the past five years, Yeltsin has sniped at him for
not moving faster and his popularity has twice translated into
impressive electoral victories.
   In March 1989 he won almost 90 percent of the vote in sweeping a
parliament seat from Moscow. Two weeks ago he outpolled more than
70 percent of the vote in his Ural Mountain hometown of Sverdlovsk
in a race for a seat in the Russian federation Congress. It is that
body that will choose the Russian president.
   If Gorbachev cannot hang on to the non-Slavic republics, there
will be less and less difference between the territory of the
Russian federation and the territory of the Soviet Union. The two
chief executives almost certainly would find their interests and
powers in conflict.
   Even without the 14 other republics, Russia would be a huge
country _ but not necessarily big enough for two masters.

<TEXT>
   The clock on St. Michael's Episcopal
Church is still missing its gold hands _ mute testimony to the 135
mph winds of Hurricane Hugo that passed this way six months ago.
   But just as yellow-green leaves have sprouted on trees stripped
bare by leviathan winds, South Carolina is mending after the worst
storm to batter its coast in centuries.
   Hugo smashed ashore at Charleston on Sept. 21, killing 29
people, leaving thousands temporarily homeless and thousands more
without electricity for weeks. With damage estimated at $5.9
billion, it was most costly hurricane to ever hit the U.S. mainland.
   Now spring has come around. Horse-drawn carriages drift through
downtown. Azaleas bloom behind wrought-iron fences. The historic
district is cleared of debris and tourist attractions have long
since reopened.
   But in outlying areas, on the sea islands northeast of town, and
in Sumter, 90 miles inland, recovery has been slower, even as
volunteers from across the nation continue to donate time, money
and energy to help in the recovery.
   Leroy Miller, a Mennonite volunteer from Weatherford, Okla., who
arrived in Charleston on Jan. 9, has helped replace roofs on 35
homes through the county's Raise the Roof program. There are still
200 people on a waiting list.
   ``People have a problem understanding why we would do this
without pay,'' Miller said. ``I don't know what to tell them. It's
just another way of reaching out to humanity.''
   Among those he helped was Harriett Yates, who after the
hurricane was forced to make do with a blue tarp to cover the roof
of her tiny, five-room house.
   ``I appreciate it,'' she said. ``I couldn't have done it without
them.''
   On nearby Sullivans Island, which was home to 2,500 people, many
buildings crushed in the 12-foot tidal surge that accompanied the
hurricane still await the bulldozer's blade, and piles of
hurricane-related debris await pickup.
   Julie Britt lost her home, but she moved into an apartment
rather than leave the island.
   ``I have never felt a love of place as much as I love this
place,'' she said. ``The way we deal with it is a blessed amnesia
in which you don't remember how it looked before.''
   On the Isle of Palms, where damage was estimated at $100
million, only about half the 3,500 residents have returned, and
some never will. Mayor Carmen Bunch said many older residents
already were pinched by rising living costs.
   Rebuilding continues slowly in hard-hit McClellanville, where
the shrimping industry was decimated, and farther north in the
resort community of Pawleys Island, which was cut in half by the
hurricane's tidal surge.
   And in many poorer areas, jobs were lost when marginal
businesses were forced to close because of storm damage and
disruption. Marvin Lare, executive director of the South Carolina
Institute on Poverty and Deprivation, said the storm could push
more than 180,000 people in the state below the poverty level.
   In Charlotte, N.C., 200 miles inland, workers still are picking
up tree limbs, brush and other debris at the rate of 32 truckloads
a day, said Linda Sherrill, a spokeswoman for the city. Electrical
crews continue to erect utility poles in a city that was left
virtually powerless after the storm.
   The Charleston council approved a temporary 14 percent property
tax increase to cover storm expenses and make up for declining
collections.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency distributed nearly $100
million to help individuals cover uninsured losses. But, as in any
relief operation, there have been problems.
   FEMA spokesman Frank Mosco said about $500,000 was returned
after the agency discovered people received money they were not
entitled to. As many as 130 people who failed to respond to FEMA
letters asking for repayments could face criminal charges, he said.
   In Carolina forests, crews are using tractors, helicopters and
mule teams to clear thousands of splintered trees. An estimated 1
billion board feet of timber _ 4.4 million acres _ was toppled, a
blow to the $4.3 billion-a-year industry.
   Larry Edmond of the U.S. Forest Service said crews hope to
salvage at least 25 percent of the downed timber. An acre of forest
normally has 3 tons to 20 tons of fuel in the form of fallen
timber. Many spots of forest in the Carolinas have 200 to 1,000
tons per acre of drying debris, officials said.
   South Carolina's $5 billion tourism industry is gearing up amid
optimism that business this summer will be as strong as ever.
Myrtle Beach escaped the brunt of the storm and Hilton Head Island,
another popular resort, was unscathed. Even with the storm, tourism
rose 4 percent last year, the state tourism department says.
   Advertisements promoting the state make no mention of Hugo or
the aftermath. But there are some who believe that such silence is
unneeded, that articles about the state's recovery will be do
nothing but help the economy.
   ``We've had so much additional exposure on Charleston in the
positive sense,'' said Helen Stansell of the Charleston Trident
Chamber of Commerce. ``South Carolina is going strong and coming
back.''

<HEAD>Foster Children Try to Sell Themselves At Easter Fashion Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sets of models waited to cross the stage
for the spring fashion show in a New Orleans mall. The young
beauties had been hired to sell clothes. The 12 nervous children
hoped to sell themselves.
   The children were wards of the state who had volunteered for
Saturday's Easter fashion show in hope that someone might see them
and want to adopt them.
   ``We're going back in time,'' said Gloria Mitchell, who attended
the fashion show at the Lakeside Mall. ``This is like slavery.
We're auctioning off these kids.''
   But officials from the state Department of Social Services said
fashion shows, like the department's weekly television spots, help
find something that's in short supply: families to adopt some of
Louisiana's 5,000 foster children.
   Except for 1988, when officials objected to having the children
shown along with cats and dogs from the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, the department has used fashion shows as a
chance to show some of these children in as good a light as
possible.
   ``I would love to not have to do this,'' said Kerry Ermon, whose
job is finding adoptive families in the New Orleans area. ``I would
love it if we had more families than children, but that's not the
reality.''
   Only children who volunteer participate. The younger ones say
they do it for fun. The older ones say they have to.
   ``I want to get a family,'' said Mark, 13, a veteran of the
fashion shows and television spots.
   Since most people prefer to adopt infants, a child's hopes of
adoption grow slimmer with every year. Television and fashion show
appearances become more urgent _ especially for black children, for
whom there are few potential families, Ermon said.
   Even the high-visibility events tend to attract more prospective
white parents than black, Ermon said. She said it's a constant
frustration for social workers that even white children who have
severe emotional problems find homes more quickly than well-behaved
black children.
   Black families in New Orleans adopt less often than white
families, Ermon said, and white families rarely adopt black
children.
   The recent fashion show brought that point squarely home. At a
show at another mall a week ago, nine of the 12 children were
black. On Saturday, seven of the eight children were black.
   Yet after the shows, almost all of the questions were about the
white children.
   Linda Burvant, a court reporter, said she and her husband have
been considering adoption. She said she didn't like to see the
children made to feel uncomfortable, but the fashion show was her
first chance to see some of the children in state custody.
   ``I would think in order to go up there they have to really want
a home,'' she said. ``It's sad.''

   A battle over an experimental hog farm
that pitted billionaire against billionaire will be decided by
voters who will choose whether to require the farm to spend $10
million on a waste treatment plant.
   In effect, Weld County voters must judge Tuesday whether the
Bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, have set up an operation using
unproven methods that could pollute the water supply _ or whether
such criticism is a smokescreen orchestrated by a rival tycoon who
has other reasons for wanting the farm closed.
   ``It's very debilitating to be attacked for the very thing you
think is very special,'' said Bill Haw, president of National Hog
Farms.
   What Haw thinks is special is the hog farm built by his company
15 miles east of here along the South Platte River. Financial
backers include four men on the Forbes magazine list of richest
Americans: Texas brothers Robert, Sid, Lee and Edward Bass. In its
October issue, the magazine estimated that Robert was worth $1.44
billion, Sid and Lee $1.25 billion each, and Edward $1 billion.
   But Philip Anschutz, owner of the Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. and the subsidiary Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad,
doesn't think the hog farm is so special _ especially since his
32,000-acre Eagles's Nest Ranch is downstream from it. Forbes put
Anschutz's worth at $1.25 billion, also chiefly from oil.
   The 25,750-acre farm, which began operating last year, plans to
raise 300,000 pigs a year in a sterile environment that avoids use
of antibiotics or other commonly used drugs.
   To get rid of the hog waste, the farm treats it and uses it to
fertilize grassland used by grazing cattle. Haw calls it ``the most
environmentally sound livestock operation in the world.''
   Haw said Anschutz is just using the environmental issue as a
ruse to try to acquire the land that National Farms now owns. Haw
said the farm thwarted Anschutz's hopes of expanding his ranch,
where he raises cattle and shoots wild game.
   ``I can't imagine what Mr. Anschutz expects to accomplish other
than vengeance,'' Haw said. ``We're certainly not going to leave.''
   Initially, Anschutz and Haw took the issue to court but now it
is the voters who get to pass judgment. The farm's owners haven't
said what they will do if the ordinance requiring the treatment
plant is approved.
   Both sides have hired Denver public relations firms to press
their arguments, and Anschutz founded and helped finance a
citizens' group called Protect Our Water.
   A vote for the proposed ordinance, said Gretchen Cutts, a
spokeswoman for the group, would send ``the right message to the
right corporations and the right message to the wrong corporations
that this is a community that cares about environmental concerns.''
   But it isn't just the Anschutz-funded group that has raised
environmental questions.
   At a hearing last week, JoAnn Silverstein, a University of
Colorado civil engineering professor, said the farm's waste
disposal process already may be increasing nitrate levels in ground
water and in the South Platte River, and would undoubtedly do so
further if the farm isn't forced to change its methods.
   Nitrates are dangerous to pregnant women and have been linked to
``blue baby syndrome,'' a potentially fatal disease in newborns
caused by lack of oxygen in the blood, she said.
   At the same hearing, however, Weld County health director Randy
Gordon called the fluctuations in nitrate levels normal and said
there is no proof they are caused by the hog farm.
   Dan Luecke of the Environmental Defense Fund in Boulder agrees
that opponents have a legitimate concern about nitrates from hog
waste seeping into water.
   ``On a conceptual level, you could say spraying the waste water
on farmland makes sense, but I have seen no data on the quality of
the water going on the land,'' he said.
   While both sides expect to win, each also concedes that Weld
County's 125,000 residents are probably confused about which way to
vote.
   According to County Clerk Mary Ann Feuerstein, Protect Our Water
spent $38,500 in campaigning through March 4. National Hog Farms
has reported spending $5,600 up to that date, but Haw estimates his
company will spend at least $70,000 before the campaigning is
finished.
   Nonetheless, Beverly Cruz, bartender at the Scotch Pub in
Greeley, said she hasn't heard any of her customers talk about the
hog farm or the waste.
   ``Usually if it's something they're concerned about they will be
talking about it,'' she said.

<HEAD>Virginia Governor's First Legislative Session Shows Cautious
Approach</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republicans who warned last fall that L.
Douglas Wilder was a liberal hiding behind conservative rhetoric
praised the nation's first black elected governor for his cautious
approach in his first legislative session.
   Wilder opened the General Assembly session in January with a
lecture on fiscal discipline, demanding that the legislature come
up with a $200 million reserve fund for 1991-92. He ended the
session by orchestrating a power play to repeal the sales tax on
non-prescription drugs, a cause he has long championed.
   But for most of the session, Wilder took a hands-off approach,
allowing the legislators to do their job. His style contrasted
sharply with that of his predecessor, Gerald L. Baliles, who
routinely had aides buttonholing legislators to lobby for his bills.
   Wilder said at a news conference on the last day of the session
March 10 that he thought the lawmakers appreciated his approach.
   ``We know how to communicate, and we've been doing it a long
time,'' said Wilder, who served 16 years in the Virginia Senate and
four years as lieutenant governor.
   Wilder's style served him well. He got his reserve fund and the
non-prescription drug tax repeal. Only four of the 119 bills
proposed by his administration failed to pass, and legislators from
both political parties went home happy.
   ``Governor Wilder in his budget restraint showed more of a
Republican philosophy than we could have hoped for,'' said House
Minority Leader Raymond R. Guest Jr. ``Baliles spent everything he
could. Wilder is trying to get us back on track.''
   Early in the session, Wilder endeared himself to Republican
leaders by calling him into his office to brief them on his
legislative agenda. ``We had more time with the governor today than
we did the previous four years,'' Guest said at the time.
   Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia,
said the approach was vintage Wilder: ``He's inclined to win groups
that would not otherwise be allied to him.''
   Sabato said the session was a good one for Wilder, whose
historic election last November is viewed by many as the first step
to national office.
   ``His agenda is in two parts,'' Sabato said. ``There's the
Virginia part and there's the national part. The bottom line is he
did well for both. He projected the image of being a fiscal
conservative and a tax-cutter. Virginians are pleased, and it's a
message he can sell to the national Democratic Party.''
   With the exception of the money initiatives, Wilder did not have
much of a legislative agenda. Sabato said that will surprise many
national observers.
   ``Part of it is the race thing,'' he said. ``It's the belief
that black governor equals activist governor. That's not
necessarily so.''
   Most of the 119 administration-proposed bills were not
controversial. Just two were rejected outright, companion bills
that would require state employees to pay part of their insurance
costs. The other two, one addressing rules governing notaries, the
other on unemployment compensation procedures, were tabled or
withdrawn.
   Mark Rozell, a political analyst at Mary Washington College in
Fredericksburg, Va., was more critical than Sabato.
   ``I don't think he's really had a coherent program, per se, that
he has articulated,'' Rozell said. ``Part of that is derived from
the budgetary crisis, which understandably places serious
constraints on his ability to be a more activist governor.
   ``Nonetheless, there have been some issues on which Wilder could
have taken a much more assertive leadership role. To that extent,
his first session has not been very successful.''
   Rozell criticized Wilder for failing to take a clear position on
such issues as public smoking restrictions and admission of women
to all-male Virginia Military Institute.
   The legislature passed a bill imposing modest statewide
restrictions on smoking, once unthinkable in tobacco-producing
Virginia. Wilder has said he's for reasonable smoking restrictions
but hasn't said whether he will sign the bill. Another bill
proposed by a legislator, to prohibit sex discrimination in public
college admissions policies, was killed.
   Rozell said Wilder's late-session tax repeal victory
``demonstrates how effective a leader he can be should he decide to
be more assertive.'' Wilder argued that the tax on non-prescription
drugs, while not a large cost to the average household, was unfair
in that it fell disproportionately on the elderly and poor.
   Sabato and most legislators liked the way Wilder distanced
himself from the legislature.
   ``The governor doesn't have to get involved in every little
squabble,'' Sabato said. ``He picked and chose his fights very
carefully.''
   ``Governor Wilder's big goal was to get the budget in shape,''
said Delegate Leslie L. Byrne, a Democrat. ``He trusts the
legislative process, and he gave us a free hand to meet the goals.
He wasn't intrusive.''
   Delegate George Allen, a Republican, said he appreciated
Wilder's silence on many controversial issues.
   ``The legislature was able to work its will,'' Allen said.
``They weren't having their arms twisted into doing things they
didn't want to do.''

<HEAD>The Case of Exxon Valdez Skipper Joseph Hazelwood Turns on Two Key
Issues</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From its beginnings as a case of many
issues, the trial of Exxon Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood has come
down to just two key questions: Was Hazelwood drunk, and was he
reckless to leave the bridge just before his tanker grounded?
   Beyond the specifics that jurors will consider when they receive
the case this week is the implicit question of whether the nation's
largest oil spill was an accident or a crime.
   ``This was a maritime accident. Captain Hazelwood was not
responsible for that accident,'' defense attorney Dick Madson told
jurors in opening statements. He is expected to make a similar
point when final arguments are presented Tuesday.
   ``The ultimate responsibility for the tanker is with the
captain,'' said Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole in his
opening statement. ``The most dangerous part of the journey was
after Hazelwood absented himself from the bridge.''
   Although many civil suits were filed after the grounding of the
Exxon Valdez a year ago next Saturday, Hazelwood was the only
member of the ship's crew charged criminally.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y. is accused of one felony,
criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors _ reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted, he could face 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in
fines.
   The tanker rammed a charted reef in Prince William Sound,
spewing nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska North Slope crude oil,
devastating fisheries and wildlife and fouling the rocky shoreline
for hundreds of miles.
   Cole promised at the outset to prove Hazelwood was drunk and
away from his appropriate post on the bridge during the most
treacherous part of the tanker's voyage in Prince William Sound.
   But his claim that the sound was treacherous was disputed by
tanker captains who testified for the defense. One called it ``a
mill pond.'' Another said it was ``like navigating the Pacific
Ocean. ... It was so wide open.'' Even the prosecution's last
witness, a Texaco tanker captain, said the sound was not a
particularly difficult area to navigate and was not crowded with
the tanker traffic that often blocks other ports.
   As testimony piled up over six weeks, it became clear that
headline-making reports of a drunken skipper were based on
circumstantial evidence. Hazelwood was seen at a bar in the port
city of Valdez the day his ship sailed.
   Witnesses reported that he drank vodka, but how much he drank
and at what hour remained in dispute. Three witnesses said they
smelled alcohol on the skipper's breath that night.
   But not a single witness described Hazelwood as appearing drunk.
No one saw him stagger. No one heard him slur his words. Crew
members said he negotiated a precarious gangway without missing a
step. They called him cool, calm and in command before and after
the grounding.
   The question of inebriation was muddled because authorities
failed to do a timely blood test. Hazelwood wasn't tested until 10{
hours after the disaster, making the results a dubious gauge of his
condition at the crucial hour.
   The prosecution called an expert witness to ``calculate
backwards'' and figure from Hazelwood's .061 blood alcohol reading
at 10:30 a.m. what the level might have been the midnight before.
The expert said Hazelwood would have been drunk with a reading of
perhaps .14.
   But defense experts said the calculation method was ``nonsense''
and involved too many variables including whether Hazelwood had
something to drink aboard ship after the grounding.
   Hazelwood, who did not testify in his own defense, never
explained. Neither did he say why he left the bridge in control of
a third mate and went below during the transit in icy conditions.
   The third mate, Gregory Cousins, tesified that Hazelwood
discussed with him a navigational plan to leave the shipping lanes,
maneuver around ice floes, and return to the shipping lanes.
   ``He asked if I felt comfortable with what we were going to do
and I said, `Yes,''' recalled Cousins. ``He said, `Do you feel
comfortable enough that I can go below and get rid of some
paperwork? I said I felt very comfortable.'''
   Cousins did not hold the special Coast Guard pilotage
endorsement for Prince William Sound, a technicality which has been
magnified during the trial.
   Hazelwood was the only officer with the special license. The
defense suggested that the Coast Guard may have waived the pilotage
requirement. That, too, remained unsettled.
   Cousins' competence became less of an issue than the abilities
of the helmsman, Robert Kagan, who was blamed by many for the
disaster.
   Cousins indicated that Kagan, who had past problems with
steering, failed to follow his command for a 10-degree right turn
which would have taken the ship out of harm's way.
   Did Hazelwood know of Kagan's deficiencies? Did he err in
leaving the bridge with this seaman at the helm?
   The jury must answer those questions and decide whether
Hazelwood's actions constitute recklessness according to a legal
definition as actions that are ``a gross deviation from the
standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the
situation.''
   Monday is set aside for legal discussions on how the judge
should instruct the jury. Final arguments are scheduled for
Tuesday, and Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone has said he hopes
to instruct jurors in the law and submit the case to them the same
day.

   Bright lights in the sky puzzled
observers in several states Saturday night, and authorities said
the phenomenon wasn't caused by space debris.
   People reported seeing strange lights _ described variously as
white streaks, flashing lights or a fireball _ in Missouri,
Southern Illinois, Iowa and Arkansas.
   A spokesman for the North American Defense Command, which tracks
objects in space from Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs,
Colo., said the lights didn't result from bits of a satellite or
other man-made debris falling through the atmosphere.
   ``We are quite confident it is not caused by the re-entry of
man-made objects,'' said Maj. Dick Adams, NORAD spokesman.
   The lights could have been meteorites, Adams said, but he
couldn't be sure because the agency doesn't track natural phenomena.
   The National Weather Service in St. Louis reported getting
numerous calls, some from people who said they saw a white light,
followed by an explosion.
   ``I was outside when it happened,'' said Highway Patrol Sgt.
Thomas Lefaivre in Kirkwood, Mo., outside St. Louis. ``I saw a big
flash like one of my halogen lights burned out. But then I noticed
my lights were okay and figured it must have been lightning.''

   Muddy floodwaters filled a Southern Alabama courthouse,
submerged a school and forced at least 1,500 people out of their
homes after a levee burst Saturday under the strain of 16 inches of
rain in two days.
   ``I have a feeling when I go back everything I own will be
gone,'' said Debra Samuel, who fled her home less than a mile from
the ruptured levee on the Pea River at Elba.
   Also in Alabama, six people drowned when their car ran off a
back road into a rain-swollen creek where a bridge had washed out,
while a Georgia woman died after she apparently drove into a creek
and her car was washed away.
   Most of western Georgia was under flood warnings Saturday
although rain had finally tapered off after a two-day deluge. In
Mississippi, about 35 homes were flooded in Jackson County and
several roads were washed out after 14 inches of rain fell in two
days, officials reported.
   No injuries were immediately reported in Elba, a town of 4,400
about 70 miles southeast of Montgomery, where the earthen levee
gave way about 6:30 a.m. Rescuers in boats plucked residents from
rooftops and trees as the waters rose, said Sheriff Brice Paul.
   The town was without electricity, and officials said there were
many gas leaks but no fires.
   Military helicopters picked up at least four people, said Bill
Hayes, an Army spokesman at nearby Fort Rucker. The helicopters
also were ferrying food to flood-stricken areas.
   Witnesses said water was up to second-story windows of the
Coffee County Courthouse, higher than it reached in a record 1929
flood.
   Cecil Rainey, a representative from Gov. Guy Hunt's office who
toured the area by helicopter, said, ``Water in downtown Elba is up
to the rooftops. It's to the top of the school.''
   Mark Oberfield, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Birmingham, said rain had been heavy throughout
southeast Alabama, including 16.8 inches in Troy and 16.3 inches in
Andalusia over the past 48 hours.
   While the sun peeked out Saturday in the region, forecasters
said rivers would continue rising. Weather service records showed
the flooding was the worst in more than 60 years in some areas.
   The weather service said the Pea River was expected to crest at
about 47 feet at Elba late Saturday, 17 feet above flood stage. The
river reached 43.5 feet in 1929.
   Elba Mayor Fred Moore said at least 1,500 people had been forced
to leave their homes.
   Most roads were flooded and telephone lines were down, and
officials were trying to set up emergency communications. The Red
Cross was sending in rescue workers from as far away as Birmingham,
some 160 miles away.
   Downstream from Elba in Geneva, more than 300 people were
evacuated in anticipation of flooding, said Margaret Mixon,
director of the Geneva County Emergency Management Agency. About 50
miles southwest, downtown Brewton was covered by 6 feet of water
from the Murder and Burnt Corn creeks.
   Also south of Elba, near the Florida border, six people died
when their car ran off a county road into a roaring creek late
Friday. Coroner Norman Hobson said the driver apparently did not
realize the bridge on the road between Florala and Samson was gone.
   ``There was a small barrier there, but nobody knows whether it
was put up before or after the wreck,'' he said.
   State troopers identified the dead as driver James Ingram
Burkett, 43, of Florala; his wife, Sandra, 44; their son, Jamie,
14; Jason Randolph Johnson, 20, of Miami; Michael Chambers, 29, of
Florala; and Lorraine C. Campbell, 29, of McAplin, Fla.
   Authorities in Henry County, Ga., found the body of a woman in a
creek Saturday afternoon. The woman, whose name was not immediately
released, apparently drove into a creek and her car was washed
away, said county Sheriff's Capt. Kenneth McBrayer.
   Elsewhere in Georgia, Peachtree Creek in Atlanta flooded, the
weather service said, and the entire Chattahoochee River was under
a flood warning from Atlanta in northern Georgia to Lake Seminole
in the southwest corner of the state.
   Several roads in the counties surrounding Atlanta were closed
early Saturday and scattered neighborhood evacuations were
reported. Two traffic fatalities in Cobb County north of Atlanta on
Friday night were attributed to rain-slicked roads.
   Rain that had pounded southeastern Mississippi for two days
stopped Saturday after flooding about 35 homes in Jackson County.
   ``Before the weekend goes, we could see at least another 30
(homes) with water in them,'' said Hank Turk, Jackson County public
safety director. Road crews were working to put down sandbags as
the Pascagoula and Escatawpa rivers rise.
   In southeast Tennessee, nearly a foot of water was reported
Saturday in the streets of Copperhill and Ducktown in Polk County,
but it was receding by afternoon. An undetermined number of people
had voluntarily left their homes, but there was no ordered
evacuation, said David King, emergency operations officer from the
Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in Nashville.

   Polls opened in East Germany's first free
election Sunday, with the speed and manner of expected German
unification a prime issue. Opposition parties alleged ex-secret
police may vote more than once to prop up Communist candidates.
   About 12.2 million voters were eligible to cast ballots for a
400-seat Parliament. With the likelihood of a merger with West
Germany, Sunday's balloting could be the 41-year-old nation's first
and last free election.
   The vote marks the full transition to democracy from the once
iron-fisted Communist rule, and help set the pace of unification
with West Germany.
   All major parties support unification but at a different pace.
Some conservative parties urge a quick merger, while leftist groups
favor a more cautious approach. Most East Germans agree such a
joining is inevitable.
   Voters will choose from a dizzying array of 24 parties and
groups. The nation's 22,000 polling stations were to stay open from
7 a.m. (1 a.m. EST) to 6 p.m. Sunday. West German television is
expected to give computerized projections Sunday night, but
official results are not expected until Monday.
   An East German television official said his crews for the first
time had to make elaborate arrangements for an election.
   ``This time, we don't know what the result is going to be.
Everything is new for us, and we should expect some chaos,'' said
the official, who refused to give his name.
   Many voters have been bewildered by the slates of candidates
ranging from radical leftists and Communists to arch-conservatives.
The campaigning was bitter, and there is continuing fear about the
once-dreaded secret police.
   Seven East German political parties claimed Saturday that former
secret police agents planned to use sets of false identity cards,
each with a different name, to vote several times.
   ``There is the suspicion of well prepared vote-rigging planned
for March 18,'' the parties said in a statement.
   The Communist-led government claims the secret police force has
been virtually disbanded, but many East Germans have doubts.
   The secret police force, which officials say once numbered
nearly 200,000 agents and informers, was the hard-line Communists'
main instrument of controlling East Germans. A popular revolution
forced the ouster of hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker on
Oct. 18 and opened the way for the elections.
   Most former secret police agents reportedly remain loyal to the
Communists, who were not expected to receive more than 18 percent
of the vote.
   In the city of Erfurt, the Social Democrats, Christian Democrats
and five other parties demanded the use of fingerprints to prevent
secret police agents from casting extra ballots.
   The parties also said they were making their concerns known to
the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
   An election commission representing all political parties has
said vote-rigging is impossible.
   The election will be monitored by observers from the 34 members
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was
founded to monitor compliance with the human rights provisions of
the 1975 Helsinki accords.
   An American observer team will consist of staff members at the
U.S. Embassy and six members of Congress, State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   The secret police, known as the Stasi in German, already have
played a part in the election.
   The top candidate of a conservative East German party resigned
last week after admitting he had worked with the secret police for
years.
   And Martin Kirchner, the general secretary of another
conservative party, the East German Christian Democrats, admitted
having contacts with the secret police during ``several sporadic
visits'' during the early 1980s. He denied cooperating with them.
   Most campaigning ended Friday, but a few political parties made
final pitches Saturday.
   The East German election is seen by many as a dress rehearsal
for West German elections in December. West German politicians have
worked hard to build up an East German base for the time when
unification comes.
   In Bonn, President Richard von Weizsaecker said the elections
would clear a ``healthy path to the unity of the Germans.''
   ``The voters in the GDR (East Germans) aren't just deciding
their own fate, but also the stability of the European home in
which we all want to live with equal rights and without fear of
each other,'' Weizsaecker added.
   Many East Berliners complained about what they considered West
German arrogance and interference in their elections. East German
flags with the Communist hammer-and-sickel insignia flew defiantly
from several buildings.
   ``It's sad that we are so dependent on the West. We feel like
beggars, as if we are asking for alms,'' said Marlies Clausenitzer,
a 50-year-old arts teacher from the town of Schoenhausen just
outside East Berlin.
   The election will be followed by efforts to form a new
government to replace the Communist-led coalition now ruling East
Germany. The large number of parties could make it difficult for
one party to win a majority, creating the need for another
coalition.
   Also on election eve, a West Berlin newspaper reported that East
Germany's caretaker government has demanded an immediate financial
bailout from Bonn to prevent economic collapse.
   ``East Germany urgently needs 5 billion marks ($2.94 billion) to
provide for the population and prevent economic collapse,'' the
Berliner Morgenpost newspaper said.
   According to the report, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has
refused to act on the East German request pending the outcome of
Sunday's elections. Kohl has said he ``is not willing to pour good
money into a bad system.''

   An American mother who went to
jail rather than reveal her daughter's whereabouts during a custody
battle was reunited with her 7-year-old child over the weekend, a
news report said Sunday.
   The New Zealand Press Association said Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who
spent 25 months in jail in the United States, went Saturday to the
motel where her daughter Hilary has lived with Ms. Morgan's parents
since mid-1988.
   Morgan's estranged husband, Eric Foretich, was reunited with
Hilary last week before returning home to the United States.
   The child custody battle has centered on the mother's claims of
sexual abuse by the father. Foretich denies the allegations.
   The New Zealand Family Court is to rule on the custody issue,
but no date has been set for the hearing.

<HEAD>Elections In Five Republics; Latvian and Estonian Movements Hope
for Victory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in five Soviet republics elected local
legislators Sunday, with crucial runoffs in the Slavic heartland
and pro-independence candidates in Latvia and Estonia hoping to
prevail as in neighboring Lithuania.
   The elections in Latvia and Estonia are the first multiparty
balloting for the parliaments of the two Baltic republics.
   Latvian People's Front spokeswoman Anda Anspoka said Saturday
that the group nominated 185 candidates for the 200 seats in the
parliament. It hoped to gain a two-thirds majority ``in order to
fight for independence.''
   Estonian backers of independence dominated the field of 392
candidates competing for the republic's 105 parliament seats,
according to activists and the Estonian Election Commission's list
of nominating groups.
   In Latvia and Estonia, elections held in December gave
pro-independence movements in the two republics up to half the
seats in local governments.
   Pro-independence candidates swept the field in neighboring
Lithuania in February elections, and the republic's new parliament
issued a dramatic declaration of independence last Sunday.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pronounced the move
``illegal and invalid'' and gave the republic until Monday to take
back the proclamation. He has not said what the Kremlin will do if
Lithuania refuses.
   The Soviet Union annexed the three Baltic republics in 1940.
Gorbachev's reforms have given voice to swelling independence
movements there.
   Runoff elections were held Sunday in Byelorussia, Russia and the
Ukraine, the vast Slavic heartland that makes up 80 percent of the
Soviet Union's territory and is home to some two-thirds of its
population.
   Most of the 1,800 races held March 4 in the three Slavic
republics required runoffs because no candidate won 50 percent of
the vote. Pro-democracy groups predict they will gain a voice _ and
in some areas even majorities _ in republic parliaments and local
councils.
   Polls in all five republics were scheduled to close at 8 p.m.
(noon EST in the Slavic republics and 1 p.m. EST in the Baltics).
Results from all the republics were not expected for several days.
   In the republic of Georgia, pro-independence radical
organizations decided after a three-day conference to boycott
elections scheduled for March 25, Tass reported.
   ``The conference decided by a majority vote to hold future
elections to an opposition council, which will control the actions
of the republic's government until complete independence is
achieved,'' Tass said.

   A gas pipeline exploded and burned in

   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the 11.30 a.m. (3 a.m.

thoroughfares, started ``a massive fire.''
   Fire crews were still battling the blaze 90 minutes later, it

   At least 10 cars were destroyed and 15 buildings badly damaged
by the explosion, the agency reported.
   A fleet of ambulances took the casualties to hospitals in the

   Fire raged in a supermarket in a western Japanese
city Sunday, killing 15 people and injuring six, police said.
   A total of 57 fire engines were dispatched to fight the blaze at
the Nagasakiya store in Amagasaki, 300 miles west of Tokyo, said
fire department spokesman Hiroshi Kawamoto.
   The fire broke out shortly after noon on the fourth floor,
filled with about 100 shoppers at the time, said Kawamoto. It took
about four hours to put out the blaze, whose cause was not
immediately known.
   Kawamoto said all 15 victims probably died of smoke and gas
inhalation, although detailed examinations of the bodies had not
yet been conducted. Police at the scene had mistakenly said earlier
that 16 people died in the blaze.
   The victims were found on the fifth floor, where the employees'
cafeteria and offices are located.
   Of the six injured, two, including a 12-year-old boy, had jumped
from the window on the fifth floor, Kawamoto said.

<TEXT>
   East Germans voted Sunday in a free election
made possible by their pro-democracy revolution, and the ballots
they cast were expected to decide the pace of the drive toward
reunification.
   In a last-minute warning, opposition parties alleged that former
secret police may vote more than once to prop up Communist
candidates.
   About 12.2 million voters were eligible to cast ballots for a
400-seat Parliament. With the likelihood of a merger with West
Germany, the balloting could have been the 41-year-old nation's
first and last free election.
   West German television was expected to make its first
projections two hours after polls close at 6 p.m. (noon EST).
   Final results weren't expected until Monday.
   Hans Modrow, Communist premier of East Germany's caretaker
government, was among the early-risers to go to the polls. Modrow
was greeted with applause when he showed up at a polling site in
East Berlin.
   ``The last days and weeks have shown that the citizens of the
GDR see this election as very important for the country's further
development,'' Modrow said, according to East Germany's ADN news
agency.
   Modrow repeated his belief that the process of German
unification cannot be separated from what happens in the rest of
Europe, said ADN.
   ``Only then, if we proceed with level-headedness, will people in
Europe be able to have a good opinion of us. And that is the
responsibility we are carrying,'' ADN quoted him as saying.
   Voters chose from a dizzying array of 24 parties and groups. All
major parties support unification but at a different pace. Some
conservative parties urge a quick merger, while leftist groups
favor a more cautious approach. Most East Germans agree such a
joining is inevitable.
   International election observers fanned out to monitor the
balloting.
   In East Berlin, 10 members of an election-monitoring delegation
from the Council of Europe started headed for their destinations in
various parts of East Germany. ``The group wants to visit as many
voting places as possible,'' delegation head Sir Geoffrey Finsberg
of Britain was quoted as saying by ADN.
   Most polling places opened at 7 a.m., but many industrial
workers were permitted to start voting two hours earlier, just
before they went to work.
   Juergen Myrau, an engineer at the Buna chemical factory near
Halle, showed up to vote shortly after the 5 a.m. poll-opening
time. ``It's a great feeling to go to a free election,'' ADN quoted
Myrau as saying.
   Wolfgang Koegel, an employee at a power plant in Suhl, a
southwestern city near the West German border, was the first to
vote in his district.
   ``No one really knows who's going to b elected. But by all means
I am for a better future, especially when I think about my two
children,'' he told ADN.
   Like other countries in the Soviet bloc, East Germany's
political landscape was redrawn last year by a pro-democracy
revolution that ousted its hard-line Communist leadership. In the
upheaval that followed, hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled
to the West, the Berlin Wall was opened and reunification became a
rallying cry in East and West Germany.

   Two freight cars and a passenger coach

   The accident occurred late Saturday at Golaghat rail bridge in
Gazipur district, 20 miles north of Dhaka.
   When the engine separated from the three cars it was pulling,
the driver stopped and the cars rammed the engine and fell into the
river.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said three

   Officials in La Rochelle said the ship, a 1,200-ton, 260-foot

   The ship is named the Goddess of Democracy, after the statue
erected in Beijing's Tiananmen Square when the democracy movement

   The vessel was dedicated a week ago by French singer-actor Yves
Montand and Chinese dissident leader Wu'er Kaixi.
   It is sponsored by 18 news organizations in several countries,
including the magazine Actuel in France and in collaboration with
the Federation for Democracy in China. The ship, operated by 11
French sailors, contains two radio studios and a television studio.
   The vessel is expected to arrive in international waters off the
coast of China between April 20 and April 25. It will broadcast
programs of music and news.

   A fire in the engine room of a cruise

passengers or disable the vessel.
   P&amp;O-Sitmar Cruises, owners of the Fairstar, said a 44-year-old
boiler attendant died after suffering burns to 75 percent of his
body during what was to be a routine testing of an auxiliary boiler.
   Officials said another crew member suffered minor burns but that
he will remain on board the ship until it docks in Sydney on Monday

   The P&amp;O-Sitmar statement said none of the 1,200 passengers on

coast and heading back to Sydney after a 10-day South Pacific
cruise when the fire occurred.

<HEAD>Palestinian Dies of Wounds, Strike in West Bank and Jerusalem</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Masked Palestinians armed with axes and knives
roamed a West Bank town Sunday to enforce a strike called in
protest of U.S. plans for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks, Arab reports said.
   Also Sunday, a Palestinian man died in a West Bank hospital
Sunday, three days after he was hit in the head by a rubber bullet
fired by Israeli soldiers, hospital reports said.
   The strike closed shops and schools in the occupied West Bank
and Arab east Jerusalem. The fundamentalist Islamic group Hamas, or
``Zeal,'' called it to protest Secretary of State James A. Baker
III's proposal for preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.
   A recent Hamas leaflet called the proposal ``an American-Zionist
conspiracy.''
   Arab reports said that in the West Bank city of Hebron, about 50
masked Palestinians armed with axes and knives stopped cars and
slashed the tires of at least 10 vehicles that defied the strike
call.
   Disagreement over the Baker plan led to the collapse last week
of Israel's coalition government. President Chaim Herzog began
consultations Sunday required by law before he chooses a leader to
form a new government.
   The right-wing prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, opposed
U.S.-backed compromises to get the preliminary talks under way,
while more liberal lawmakers supported the compromises. Shamir's
rival, Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, engineered a vote of
no-confidence that passed and brought down the government.
   Herzog was expected to give the mandate for forming a government
to Peres.
   The man who died Sunday was identified as Salim Yacoub Rihan,
50. Arab reports said he was shot Thursday night as he drove a
horse-drawn cart through the Al Amari refugee camp in the West Bank.
   A doctor at Ramallah Hospital said Rihan was hit in the head
with a single rubber bullet ``fired at close range.'' The doctor
asked not to be identified.
   An army official confirmed that Israeli had fired rubber bullets
in Al Amari on Thursday to disperse stone-throwers. The official,
who cannot be identified by name under briefing rules, said the
army was checking further into the incident.
   Rubber bullets are generally not lethal, although they can cause
death if fired at close range and if they penetrate the head, chest
or abdomen.
   Rihan's death raised to 664 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians since the uprising against Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987.
Forty-three Israelis have died.
   An additional 198 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs.
   In the Gaza Strip on Sunday, an 18-year-old Palestinian was in
critical condition after he was hit in the head by a plastic bullet
in a stone-throwing confrontation with soldiers in Gaza City, Arab
hospital officials said.

<HEAD>Down-and-Dirty Texas Governor's Race May Set Tone for 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 campaign season opened in slashing
style in Texas, setting a nasty tone that experts predict will mark
many races this year.
   Candidates may sign clean-campaign pledges, commentators may
criticize nasty ads, but if negative tactics work, politicians will
use them, analysts say.
   Political consultants see nothing wrong with that.
   ``The standard should be, do you tell the truth and is it fair _
even though the truth is painful,'' said Bob Squier, who is
handling Democrat Ann Richards' media spots in the Texas
gubernatorial race.
   ``I rely on the press for accuracy, which is probably a mistake,
and the public decides whether it's fair,'' said GOP media
consultant Roger Ailes, who handled George Bush's ads in 1988 and
this year is working for Senate hopeful Lynn Martin of Illinois and
others.
   In Texas, the three Democratic candidates pledged not to attack
the character, integrity or honesty of their opponents, with this
result:
   _Richards, now facing a runoff against state attorney general
Jim Mattox, ran an ad charging that Mattox and former Gov. Mark
White got rich off public service and had ``the worst resumes money
can buy.''
   _White ran an ad telling viewers to watch Mattox's lips: ``If
they're moving, he could be lying.''
   _Mattox took aim at Richards' refusal to discuss whether she
ever had used illegal drugs. ``Maybe after you've decided not to
tell the truth about yourself, it's pretty easy to lie about your
opponents,'' his ad said.
   John Buckley, a former spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said Richards might not have made it into
the April 10 Democratic runoff had she not gone negative.
   ``The (Texas) candidates were not making a lot of headway with
positive appeals,'' acknowledged Mike McCurry, a spokesman for the
Democratic National Committee. ``There's some discussion that ...
when everybody is up and running, the only way to break through
that clutter is to go sharply negative.''
   While the Texas Democrats appear likely to continue their
bloodletting through the runoff, some candidates have had second
thoughts about using negative ads this year.
   In Florida, Rep. Bill Nelson, a candidate for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination, opened his campaign by trying to blame
GOP Gov. Bob Martinez for the early release of a convict who later
was charged with killing two police officers.
   Nelson quickly shelved the strategy after a rival Democrat
accused him of trying to ``Willie Horton-ize'' the election and a
circuit judge scolded him for calling the convict a killer before
he had been tried.
   Horton, a convicted killer, became a campaign issue in 1988 when
George Bush criticized Michael Dukakis for supporting a
Massachusetts furlough program from which Horton escaped.
   Nelson's campaign is not the only one that has backed off from
negative ads.
   Texas Republican gubernatorial hopeful Kent Hance had a change
of heart provoked by a drop in the polls. With his support waning,
Hance withdrew a confusing TV ad questioning the integrity of GOP
rival and eventual victor Clayton Williams.
   Some observers cited the Hance incident as proof that negative
ads don't pay, but others argued the ad's flaws had nothing to do
with its tone.
   ``There's good and bad, effective and ineffective, smart and
dumb,'' said Squier. ``If you do a dumb ad, it will probably
backfire on you.''
   While much of the Texas mudslinging was done through television
ads, candidates and their surrogates are on the attack live and in
person, as well.
   In California, for example, Democratic Attorney General John Van
de Kamp turned his candidacy announcement into a tirade against
primary opponent Diane Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco.
   Van de Kamp blasted Feinstein's record on civil rights,
insurance, the environment and women's issues, and accused her of
budget mismanagement that turned San Francisco into ``the city that
could not pay.''
   Feinstein's surge past Van de Kamp, meanwhile, was largely
attributed to early ``positive'' ads that discussed her experience
and support for the death penalty.
   Other are taking the positive approach, as well.
   In Florida, Martinez is touting his record on the environment.
Martin has run a soft, getting-to-know-you spot in Illinois. And
Rep. Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala., a candidate for governor, ran an ad
featuring a county development chairman praising his work for a new
economic project.
   There's no guarantee, however, that any of these races won't
turn nasty, particularly when the field narrows after the primary
season.
   Martin's opponent, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., has invoked the
negative-ad threat as a fund-raising tool. ``Roger Ailes, Bush's
media hitman, who produced some of the most vicious campaign ads of
1988, is now at work on TV spots for Martin. We must be ready to
respond,'' Simon wrote past contributors earlier this year.
   Some analysts believe the nastiest races in 1990 may be those in
which the candidates are the most alike, leaving character as the
only battleground. By that theory, candidates with substantive
disagreements can take the higher road.
   Already, however, reality is departing from theory. In Iowa,
where GOP Rep. Tom Tauke is challenging Sen. Tom Harkin, a liberal
Democrat, the recent focus has been on Harkin's homes in Virginia
and the Bahamas.
   The state Republican chairman charged that Harkin is a hypocrite
who's out of touch with Iowans.
   Desperate, vicious, negative, countered the Harkin campaign.
   ``GOP flings mud first,'' the Des Moines Register said.
   Business as usual, the experts say.

<HEAD>Drug-Using Teens Three Times More Likely To Try Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-agers on drugs are at least three times
more likely to attempt suicide than drug-free adolescents,
according to a study of patients at drug treatment centers.
   Dr. Richard H. Schwartz, a Vienna, Va., pediatrician who
co-authored a report published in the American Journal of Diseases
of Children, said the research shows that drugs play a powerful
role in the large numbers of teenage suicides.
   ``There's no question that the drugs themselves can lead to
depressive effects that lead to suicide attempts,'' he said. `` ...
The more easily obtainable is the drug, the greater the adverse
effects. Suicide attempts increase dramatically.''
   Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15- to
24-year-old Americans. In Virginia, Schwartz said, it is the second
leading cause of death among this age group.
   Schwartz said his study involved testing and questioning 298
adolescent patients at four treatment centers he identified only as
being in three separate areas east of the Mississippi River.
Two-thirds of those surveyed admitted they had thoughts about
committing suicide and 30 percent said they had made actual suicide
attempts.
   Earlier studies, said Schwartz, show that between 6 and 7
percent of the general population attempt suicide in adolescence.
   Schwartz said the patients in his study were between 13 and 19
years old. Most, 93 percent, were white, and 66 percent were male.
   The most popular drug among the group was marijuana, with
alcohol a distant second. Other drugs, such as crack, cocaine,
angel dust and LSD also were used.
   Among those who attempted suicide, 40 percent said they made the
attempt within eight hours after using drugs.
   Although there probably are ``multiple factors'' that lead to
suicide attempts, Schwartz said the higher rate among drug users
may be attributed to the depressive effects or ``low'' that
develops after using some drugs.
   ``Some drugs, in and of themselves, have depressive effects.
Alcohol does, and so does PCP (or angel dust) and LSD,'' said
Schwartz. For drugs that are stimulants, such as crack or cocaine,
``the depression is a rebound. They go up very high, and the higher
the high, the lower the low.''
   Following a crack binge, for instance, he said, there will be an
``almost intolerable'' depression and many drug users see no way
out but suicide.
   Most of the suicide attempts were ``of low lethality,'' said
Schwartz, with 61 percent requiring no medical attention. But 10
percent tried to kill themselves at the wheel of a car and 8
percent tried to hang themselves.
   ``About 15 percent (of those attempting suicide) spent time in
intensive care,'' said Schwartz. ``These were not superficial wrist
slashings'' but serious attempts that could have resulted in death
without prompt medical care.
   The physician said he and his co-author, American University
psychologist Alan L. Berman, were ``astounded'' that almost half of
the teens who seriously attempted suicide reported that lethal
means for doing it again were still in their family homes.
   Schwartz said 23 percent of those who tried to kill themselves
said their families continued to keep firearms and ammunition
around the home afterwards.
   ``You cannot keep weapons at home like that if there is an
adolescent on drugs,'' he said. ``You can assume a one-in-nine
chance of multiple suicide attempts so you need to get rid of
firearms. Among successful suicides, there's a growing tendency to
use firearms.''
   The study by Schwartz and Berman is in the March issue of the
American Journal of Diseases of Children.

   A driverless car packed with explosives
rolled toward a hotel early Sunday where Syrian soldiers are based,
but it careened off course into sandbags and the bomb was defused
safely, police said.
   A police spokesman said the target of the car bomb was almost
certainly the Commodore Hotel, which houses about 100 Syrian
soldiers.
   The seven-story hotel in Moslem west Beirut was for years the
main base of Western correspondents covering Lebanon's civil war.
It was wrecked in 1987 in fighting between rival Moslem militias.
   Police reported that before dawn, the navy blue Audi sedan, its
motor and lights off, was rolled down a street leading to the
Commodore Hotel.
   ``But it veered slightly to the left and hit a sandbag position
on a road intersection about 20 yards from the Commodore, and
luckily failed to go off,'' said the police spokesman. He cannot be
named under standing regulations.
   The spokesman said bomb disposal experts established that the
explosives were set to detonate at 4 a.m., but they could not
determine why they did not go off.
   The car bomb remained undetected for more than two hours, until
Syrian sentries began patrolling the area at 6 a.m., the spokesman
added.
   Two boxes of explosives, weighing a total of 132 pounds, were
taken from the car.
   No group claimed responsibilty for the attempted bombing. Had it
gone off, the bomb would have been the second such attack in
Lebanon this year.
   Lebanon's warring factions have used car bombs as weapons of
terror since the civil war broke out in 1975.
   On Jan. 27, a car bomb exploded 50 yards from the home of Sheik
Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddin, spiritual head of Lebanon's 1.2 million
Shiite Moslems, in an apparent assassination attempt. No one was
hurt.
   It too was rolled down an incline but detonated after it bumped
into an earth mound at the side of the road.
   The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate.
   They control about 70 percent of the country and have long been
targets for Moslem rivals who seek to undermine their peacekeeping
mission.
   The Commodore is across the street from a seven-story block
housing the Beirut offices of The Associated Press, CBS and NBC,
the British Broadcasting Corp. and Kuwait's al-Qabas daily
newspaper.
   Elsewhere Sunday, police reported new battles between renegade
Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and fighters of the Lebanese Forces
militia, headed by Samir Geagea.
   The rival Christian forces pounded each other with artillery and
tank barrages all night in the Christian enclave north of Beirut,
police said. There was no immediate report of casualties.
   The exchanges in the mountains of Kesrouan province followed
mortar duels Saturday in which six civilians were killed.
   The victims included a family of four trapped in a burning
underground shelter.
   By police count, 762 people have been killed and 2,115 wounded
since Jan. 30, when Aoun launched his attempt to crush Geagea's
militia. The Lebanese Forces militia is the only serious military
challenge to Aoun's leadership of the estimated 1 million
Christians in the enclave.

<HEAD>Disabilities Bill Gets Second Wind in House</HEAD>

   A bill that would guarantee equal rights to
millions of Americans with handicaps is moving toward passage this
spring, although disagreement over a related civil rights proposal
threatens that timetable.
   Backers of the Americans With Disabilities Act say the bill has
regained momentum after a nearly four-month interruption that
included adjournment of Congress. Supporters had planned on full
passage before Christmas.
   The bill would grant disabled people equal employment
opportunity, although business with fewer than 15 employees would
be exempted. It also would grant equal access to transportation,
telephone service, business and entertainment, and professional
services.
   On March 6, a subcommittee of the House Public Works and
Transportation Committee sent the Senate-passed bill to the full
committee after modifications favorable to the transportation
industry.
   The House Education and Labor Committee approved the bill last
November on a 35-0 vote, adding only a clarification sought by the
business community on the status of drug users.
   More importantly, the House Energy and Commerce Committee
reported the bill last week on a 40-3 vote with no amendments to
the Senate-passed version except for more compromises over
transportation requirements.
   The recent actions mean that only the Judiciary and Public Works
and Transportation committees must act on the bill before it goes
to the House floor.
   ``We are confident that the Americans With Disabilities Act will
be enacted into law in either April or May of this year,'' said
Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, a coalition of civil rights groups.
   The National Federation of Independent Business, the
small-business advocacy group that is trying to change the bill
substantially, says it has made gains through lobbying at the grass
roots level and in Congress.
   To that end, NFIB in February persuaded the House Small Business
Committee to conduct a hearing on the bill even though it lacks
jurisdiction. Among witnesses were businessmen in wheelchairs who
said they objected to portions of the legislation.
   ``I think that we're making progress and I think that the
momentum is shifting somewhat,'' NFIB lobbyist David K. Rehr said.
   Rehr said both Democrats and Republicans in the House are
looking at the bill's economic impact more critically than the
Senate did when the bill passed that chamber, 76-8, in September.
   The supporters of the bill say business concerns were considered
at every step. The bill provides long timetables for
implementation, a number of exemptions and a promise of technical
guidance, supporters say.
   They say the bill's costs will be offset by more disabled
Americans entering the economic mainstream and depending less on
government payments.
   The NFIB and others contend the bill is laden with legal
abstractions that will force the typical Main Street proprietor to
spend even more on lawyers' fees, both inside and outside of court.
   NFIB also wants a tax credit for businesses that accommodate
disabled employees or customers. The group argues that the
disabilities bill is the only civil rights legislation that imposes
a direct cost on business.
   But those issues will be set aside until a bigger one involving
the White House is resolved. Vocal White House support helped move
the bill through the Senate and helped win over Republicans in the
House.
   When disabled activists demonstrated at the Capitol last week _
many of them later to be arrested in their wheelchairs for acts of
civil disobedience _ Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told them:
   ``We are 25 years late in having a civil rights bill for the
disabled. We understand that.''
   Hoyer's oblique reference to the Civil Rights Act of 1964
pointed to the new threat. The same civil rights community that
backs the disabilities law as a logical and morally necessary
extension of the 1964 act also backs the Civil Rights Act of 1990,
which was introduced in February.
   The new law would change Title VII of the landmark 1964 law to
make it possible to sue employers for damages if they intentionally
discriminate against blacks, other minorities and women.
   Title VII currently limits relief to non-damage remedies, such
as back pay and injunctive relief, that could be awarded by a judge.
   The disabilities bill refers directly to Title VII as the source
of relief for job discrimination against the disabled.
   The Bush administration opposes the modification to the civil
rights act and has asked that the Title VII reference be stripped
from the disabilities bill. Instead, the specific remedies would be
spelled out.

<HEAD>Thousands Demand Democratic Changes, Denounce Aging Politicians</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 20,000 people rallied in a
downtown park Sunday to demand swifter democratic change and to
denounce elderly members of the electoral college that will choose
Taiwan's president this week.
   The protest was the largest in Taiwan since the lifting of
martial law in 1987. It highlighted growing anger with a political
system largely dominated by aging members of the ruling Nationalist
Party born on mainland China.
   Police said there were about 10,000 protesters, but reporters
estimated the crowd at more than 20,000. Many, however, were
onlookers.
   In a reference to the elderly Nationalists who control the
electoral college, protesters shouted, ``Old thieves, step down!''
and ``People elect the president!'' Demonstrators beat drums and
gongs to galvanize the crowd.
   Leaders of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which
organized the demonstration, urged President Lee Teng-hui to
dissolve the electoral college, known as the National Assembly, and
allow general presidential elections.
   The National Assembly elects the president Wednesday, and Lee is
the only candidate.
   About 500 college students continued a sit-in they began Friday
in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park to protest the aging
assemblymen. Democratic Progressive Party politicians urged the
crowd to support the protest by staying in the park overnight and
delaying the filing of income tax.
   ``This park will become another Tiananmen Square if the ruling
party still refuses to listen,'' said opposition party chairman
Huang Hsin-chieh, referring to last year's pro-democracy protests
in China.
   ``We have tolerated this absurd parliament for 40 years. We
cannot and should not stand it any longer,'' said Chang Kuo-lung, a
physics professor of the National Taiwan University.
   In the park, some protesters burned a national flag after they
chopped off the flag pole. A man and two women who tried to stop
the flag burning were slightly injured in a melee with the
protesters.
   Demonstrators forced several photographers to pull out their
film.
   The white gates and a facade of the Chinese-style park were
painted with slogans such as ``Old Thieves Go, Democracy Comes''
and ``Long Live Taiwanese.''
   About 100 protesters later marched one mile to the presidential
building and demanded a meeting with President Lee. They were
blocked by hundreds of riot police behind barbed-wire barricades.
The group then staged a brief sit-in and returned to the park.
   Students, mostly from the prestigious National Taiwan
University, vowed to stage a one-week class boycott beginning
Monday to press their demands for democratic change.
   The focus of the anger are the 668 elderly deputies in the
752-seat National Assembly who were elected on the Chinese mainland
before 1949. In 1949, they fled to Taiwan with the rest of the
Nationalist government after losing a civil war to Communist forces.
   The deputies, many in their 80s and 90s, have been frozen in
office to support the Nationalist claim to still be the legitimate
government of China. They have defiantly rejected demands they
retire.
   In an attempt to ease growing public criticism, President Lee
appealed to the nation in a televised speech Saturday night to
``use a calmer and more responsible attitude to face our present
political development.''
   Critics said Lee's address was too vague because he failed to
give a timetable for introducing more democracy to this island of
20 million people.
   Lee is a 67-year-old native Taiwanese. Many aging assemblymen
distrust Lee because they believe he is not committed to their
dream of returning victoriously to the Chinese mainland. But they
dropped efforts to draft their own candidate for Wednesday's vote
because of intense public pressure.

<HEAD>Senate Leaders Faced With Tough Amendments to Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders, struggling to keep a
compromise clean air agreement from unraveling, hope this week to
fend off a series of ``strengthening'' amendments that the White
House calls too expensive.
   Returning from a weeklong recess, senators renew debate Tuesday
on the far-reaching air pollution control legislation that has
preoccupied the Senate most of this month.
   Among the thorniest issues are whether to go along with a plea
from Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., for assistance to any coal miners
who lose their jobs because of new pollution curbs and over
attempts by more than a dozen senators to toughen controls on
smog-causing pollutants from automobiles.
   Meanwhile, similar legislation in the House has begun to move.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee begins this week to
consider details of the bill.
   Although President Bush has indicated he would like to have a
clean air bill in time for his signature by Earth Day, which will
be celebrated April 22, no one on Capitol Hill predicts a bill will
be ready by then.
   The clean air legislation _ somewhat different versions in the
Senate and House _ represent the first major changes in 13 years in
the 1970 Clean Air Act. Bush as well as most members of Congress
acknowledge tougher controls on air pollution are overdue.
   But getting a bill through Congress has pitted regional groups
against one another and prompted intense lobbying by a variety of
industries who argue that the controls under consideration are too
expensive and threaten the nation's economy.
   The House and Senate bills impose significantly tougher controls
on smog-causing pollutants from both automobiles and industrial
sources; require industry to install new equipment to curb toxic
chemical releases that now total more than 2.7 billion pounds a
year; and for the first time require sharp reductions in sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fired electric power
plants to curb acid rain.
   But a coalition of senators argue that a compromise agreement
with the White House after weeks of closed-door negotiations
substantially weakened the Senate bill, especially its curbs to
control urban smog by tightening emissions from automobiles.
   Sens. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., and Pete Wilson, R-Calif., planned
to push an amendment early in the week that would restore a tougher
second round of tailpipe controls and require automakers to produce
a specific number of alternative fuel vehicles.
   The tougher controls in the Wirth-Wilson amendment have been
strongly criticized by the Bush administration and characterized as
likely ``deal breakers'' that could scuttle the compromise
agreement and threaten passage of clean air legislation altogether.
   Byrd's coal miner assistance amendment also has been called a
threat to the Senate-White House agreement and will have to be
dealt with before serious progress can be made on other provisions,
according to Senate aides.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, had been
prepared to vote on the Byrd proposal before the Senate adjourned
for its recess. But Mitchell postponed a vote after it became
unclear whether he had enough votes to rebuff Byrd, who wields
considerable power among senators because of his chairmanship of
the appropriations committee.
   The Byrd plan calls for the government to pay miners between 50
percent to 80 percent of their most recent salaries for four years
after they become unemployed if their job loss stems from tougher
acid rain pollution controls on coal utilities.
   The controversy over the coal miner provisions threatened to
complicate attempts by Mitchell and Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the
minority leader, to keep support for the compromise legislation
intact.
   If the assistance program is approved, it could cause the White
House to withdraw support for the legislative package and cause
other senators to seek similar job protection provisions for other
workers _ such as the petrochemical or steel industries _ who also
face possible harm.
   But if Byrd is rebuffed, he could persuade enough senators to
oppose the bill to prevent its passage.
   In the House, meanwhile, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he wanted to complete
action on clean air legislation before the Easter recess April 6.
   Dingell last week cautioned committee members to proceed
``without undue delay and procrastination'' but said he anticipated
``long and difficult'' committee sessions, with the consideration
of amendments scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   Among the yet-unresolved problems facing the House committee is
whether to provide assistance to coal-burning utilities in the Ohio
Valley and elsewhere in the Midwest that meet tougher acid rain
controls.
   The Bush administration staunchly opposes a national fee or tax
to help the dirtiest electric plants cut pollution, but Rep. Philip
Sharp, D-Ind., is planning to seek such a fee on industrial
emitters of sulfur dioxide.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and other members also are expected
to seek tougher emission controls on toxic and smog-causing
pollutants from industrial sources and further reductions in
automobile emissions both through tighter tailpipe controls and
wider use of alternative fuel vehicles.

   Rita Schattman isn't old enough to vote, but
the Republican Party thinks she's got enough cash in the bank to
automatically hand over $12.50 a month to its ``Secret Candidate
Support Weapon.''
   A 16-year-old Democrat from Fort Worth, Texas, Miss Schattman
was surprised to find a genuine $25 check mailed to her recently
from an arm of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
   But it wasn't until she got to the 11th paragraph of a
three-page letter touting the GOP's new ``Candidate Escrow
Funding'' concept that Miss Schattman realized that by cashing the
check she was agreeing to let the party take $12.50 a month out of
her bank account.
   After a two-month trial at the GOP's expense, Miss Schattman
could either cancel participation or continue letting the party
automatically transfer $12.50 a month from her bank account to a
fund to help Republican candidates.
   Trouble is, the high school junior says she doesn't even have a
checking account.
   ``It's the oddest thing I think I've ever received,'' she said
after school Friday. Republican officials are also at a loss to
explain how Miss Schattman, who hopes to get her driver's license
this week, wound up on a mailing list for prospective members of
the Republican Presidential Task Force.
   When she saw the check, Miss Schattman said her first reaction
was: ``That's pretty stupid for them to send me money, I wouldn't
do anything for them.''
   Miss Schattman said she then tried to think of a way of
endorsing the check over to a cause like Habitat for Humanity or
the Abortion Rights League. But she decided she didn't want to risk
having her name show up in the ``charter issue'' of ``Who's Who in
the Republican Party.''
   The fund-raising letter, paid for and authorized by the National
Republican Senatorial Committee, said recipients who deposit their
checks before the expiration date would be included in what
promises to become ``one of America's most prestigious reference
books.''
   ``I want to know if it's legal for them to have done that (send
out the checks). Old ladies, who don't read the entire thing
because it hurts their eyes might think, how nice. And they can't
read the tiny print on the back of the check,'' Miss Schattman said.
   Buried on the back of the check, in tiny type, is a notice that
the $12.50 monthly charge would be going up by 10 percent on each
one-year anniversary.
   Other Democrats also are questioning the Republican's strategy.
Joe Louis Barrow, deputy director of communications for the
Democratic National Committee, said a Democratic lawyer in
Pennsylvania received a similar letter and has apparently asked the
Federal Election Commission for a ruling.
   Bob Slagle, Texas Democratic Party chairman, called the
fund-raising effort ``too deceitful and fraudulent to be funny.''
   ``Leave it to the Republicans to figure out another way to con
you,'' Slagle said.
   Since the Feb. 23 letter went out to several thousand people,
the National Republican Senatorial Committee has made several
changes for its next edition, including adding a toll-free number
for recipients confused about the plan, said spokeswoman Wendy
DeMocker.
   ``We do want good will attached to our fund-raising efforts,''
she said.
   Ms. DeMocker said the first mailing went to current members of
the Republican Presidential Task Force who mail in a monthly $10
contribution, and to prospective members.
   She said using electronic fund transfers instead of soliciting
individual checks from thousands of contributors was a ``more
streamlined'' way of doing business. But she didn't know how a
16-year-old wound up on the mailing list.
   ``How she found her way onto our mailing list is,'' she paused,
``interesting. ... That's pretty unusual.''
   Slagle complained some recipients of the check might deposit it
without realizing what they were getting into.
   ``Most people aren't interested in reading three pages and I'm
sure some people are going to be suckered by it,'' Slagle said.
   Ms. DeMocker, however, said participants would see on their bank
statements that $12.50 was being taken out ``and there is a
three-page letter.''
   Slagle, an attorney, also questioned whether the contract
printed on the back of the check is enforceable under a Texas law
which requires the use of large type for certain contract
provisions.
   ``I'd hate to be a lawyer enforcing that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Auto Fuel Efficiency Slipped in Past Two Years, Group Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Average fuel economy for automobiles has
declined each of the last two years, reversing an earlier five-year
trend toward more efficient automobiles, an environmental group
said Sunday.
   The Environmental Action Foundation cited statistics from the
Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   According to the government figures cited by the group, the
average fuel economy of 1990 model cars is expected to be 28.2
miles per gallon, compared with 28.3 mpg for 1989 model cars and
28.7 mpg for 1988 model cars.
   An analysis by the EPA attributed the trend to the manufacture
of heavier cars with quicker acceleration times and the use of
larger engines with greater horsepower.
   ``In terms of fuel efficiency we're heading south on a
northbound, one-way street,'' said Robert Dewey of the
Environmental Action Foundation.
   The figures showed that between the 1983 and 1988 model years
the fuel efficiency of both domestic and imported cars increased
steadily from 26.4 mpg to 28.7 mpg.
   Dewey said the government figures also show that the gap between
imports and domestic cars is narrowing in terms of fuel efficiency.
In 1986, imports on a fleet-wide basis were 8 mpg more efficient
than domestic cars. In the 1990 models, the difference has narrowed
to 3 mpg, he said.
   ``These figures clearly dispel the myth that Japanese automakers
still hold a huge efficiency advantage over domestics,'' said Dewey.
   The advantage of Japanese automakers in past years over domestic
fleets in fuel efficiency largely has been based on the fact the
Japanese built smaller cars. In recent years with government
restrictions on the number of imports, the Japanese imports have
consisted of more large, less fuel efficient vehicles.
   There has been increasing concern among environmentalists over
the fuel efficiency of cars because the more gasoline cars use the
more they emit carbon dioxide, which is linked to global warming.
   Legislation expected to be considered later this year in the
Senate would require automakers to achieve a fleetwide 40 mpg by
the end of the decade. Efforts also are expected to put a similar
provision into the clean air legislation that now is before House
Energy and Commerce Committee. The automakers have vigorously
lobbied against such legislation.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Strong Public Support for Organic Foods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of organically grown fruits and
vegetables say a new poll shows that the popularity of produce
grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides is more than just
a passing fad.
   The Louis Harris poll being released Monday does show, however,
that national publicity about possible pesticide dangers has
prompted more people to try organic produce.
   The 1989 survey found that 84 percent of Americans would prefer
organically grown fruits and vegetables, the same percentage as in
a similar poll conducted in 1988.
   The first poll was taken before a deluge of negative publicity
about Alar, a chemical used in growing apples that was taken off
the market after reports that it might cause cancer.
   ``This shows that the organic mandate is not a passing fad
fueled by fear, but a clear preference fueled by reason,'' said
Stevie Daniels, executive editor of Organic Gardening magazine,
which commissioned the survey.
   ``With organic food gaining faster acceptance, the lack of a
federal organic standard is often cited as the reason why such
foods are not more readily available at large supermarket chains,''
said Organic Gardening analysts.
   ``The large retailers are looking for a USDA label to make sure
they have a label the consumers will understand,'' Daniels said.
   Some 30 percent of those surveyed said they had changed their
eating habits, of whom 28 percent actually sought out organically
grown food.
   The latest survey found a big increase in the percentage of
people who had eaten organically grown food. Nearly 58 percent of
those surveyed in 1989 reported they had eaten organic foods, up
from 38 percent a year earlier.
   The increase shows the increasing popularity of organic foods
after the negative pesticide reports of 1989, according to Organic
Gardening's analysts.
   The reason given by 65 percent of the respondents for eating
organically grown food was long-term health effects. The next
largest group, 19.5 percent, cited nutritional value.
   More than 52 percent said they would buy organically grown
produce even if it cost more, down from 58 percent in the 1988
survey. Eighty-four percent said they would buy organic foods if
they cost the same, virtually the same percentage as a year earlier.
   Interviews for the nationwide poll were conducted by telephone
between Nov. 6 and Dec. 13, 1989. The previous survey was done
between Nov. 9 and Dec. 23, 1988. Sampling error for the results is
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, has introduced legislation that would set a national
standard enabling qualified growers to label their produce
``organically produced.''
   The bill would:
   _Prohibit farmers from using synthetic chemicals for at least
three years before their products could be labeled organic.
   _Mandate periodic residue testing and periodic unannounced site
inspections.
   _Allow states and-or independent agencies to run the
certification programs.
   _Allow states to enact stronger standards.
   Leahy said the bill is designed to reduce consumer confusion
over self-proclaimed organic, or ``natural'' foods.
   ``It's downright dishonest to call foods `natural' when they are
grown with heavy doses of toxic chemicals,'' Leahy said in a
statement after introducing his bill.
   ``Increased demand for organic foods will help farmers save
money in pesticide costs and protect them from overexposure to
toxic chemicals,'' he said.

   The United States trails its foreign
competitors in the health and care of children and fares poorly in
a comparison of child poverty rates, a House committee reported
Sunday.
   The report by the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and
Families said the United States has the highest percentage of
children affected by divorce and its male youths are far more
likely to be murdered than those in other developed nations.
   ``What this shows is there are some very serious questions about
the status of America's children when compared to others,'' said
the panel's chairman, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif.
   The committee based the report on a new study by the U.S. Census
Bureau's center for international research, which compared
statistics on U.S. children with those of 11 other nations.
   Among its findings:
   _U.S. children experience the highest parental divorce rate. One
in four children now live in single-parent families, which have
higher poverty rates than two-parent families. The proportion of
children living in single-parent families increased since 1960 in
all 12 countries but the gap between the United States and the 11
others widened.
   _Among six industrialized countries, the United States and
Australia had the highest poverty rates among families with
children, 15 percent and 14 percent respectively, even after tax
and transfer benefits were applied.
   _At least 99 percent of poor families with children in the other
developed countries received government assistance, compared to 73
percent in the United States.
   _The rate of teenage pregnancy was highest in the United States
than other countries examined.
   _Infant mortality rates ranged from a low of 5 deaths per 1,000
live births in Japan to 25 deaths per 1,000 in the Soviet Union.
The U.S. rate was 10 deaths per 1,000 live births, equal to or
worse than nine countries.
   _The United States had a murder rate for male youths four to
five times that of other developed countries. But Mexico had a rate
twice that of the United States.
   _The United States compared favorably in rates of youth
unemployment and suicide.
   Miller said statistics on infant mortality show the United
States does a good job of saving ill babies that would have died in
less developed countries. But low average birth weights suggest the
United States does a poor job of prenatal care, he said.
   ``It's lack of will,'' Miller said. ``We're not willing to spend
those preventative dollars. It's criminal, really.''
   He said the comparisons suggest the United States will not meet
goals set by President Bush to make the United States rank first in
science and math education by the end of the 1990s.
   The report compared 12 industrialized countries: Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Japan,
Norway, Soviet Union, Sweden, United States. It also provided some
information on four countries listed as developing: Israel, Mexico,
India and China.
   The study used various types of data from the countries, and
comparisons often were based on figures from different years.
   In a minority report, Republicans on the committee said such
variations limit its value. They said the report ``cannot be used
as evidence to prove that a new child policy agenda is needed.''
   Republicans said the most significant comparison showed the
United States has the highest proportion of single-parent families.
   ``While 22.9 percent of family households in the United States
are headed by a single-parent, less than 6 percent of households in
Japan are headed by a single parent,'' they said.
   ``This factor has widespread implications for many indicators,
including poverty, infant mortality rates, teenage pregnancy rates,
abortions, out-of-wedlock births and even educational
achievement,'' the Republicans said.

<TEXT>
   A dream Vaclav Havel cherished
through years of persecution came true Sunday: the brave 2,000
people of Charter 77, Eastern Europe's oldest human rights
movement, met for the first time.
   They were packed into the elegant Prague building where Havel
last November negotiated the overthrow of Stalinism with Communist
leaders. Aged men, bent old women, bearded hippies and fresh-faced
youth relished their freedom to be together at last.
   ``The feeling is excellent,'' beamed Petr Pospichal, a longtime
dissident who works for Civic Forum, the movement born out of
Charter that overturned Communist rule last fall. ``After all these
years, we just now realize how many we are.''
   ``For many years,'' prisoner-turned-president Havel said in
brief opening remarks, ``I had a dream. I had this dream when I was
free, but more often when I was in prison.
   ``It was a dream that all signatories of Charter 77 would meet
one day in some Prague hall, and will talk without being disturbed
by the police. This dream, this archetypal vision, is being
fulfilled today.''
   But the joy for Havel, and many others, was tinged with grief
for those who did not live to see the triumph of the 13-year
struggle waged by Eastern Europe's oldest, and arguably most
diverse, movement for freedom and human dignity.
   Among those mourned was Jan Patocka, a philosopher who like
Havel was one of the first signatories of Charter 77. He was one of
its first spokesmen and spiritual father of its vision of founding
a civic society in which free citizens take responsibility for
their actions.
   Patocka died in March 1977, two months after Charter was born,
after intensive police interrogation.
   Charter, whose ideals are now expressed in state policy rather
than underground literature circulated among friends, was unique in
Eastern Europe in uniting many different strands of thought.
   It began as an association of 240 intellectuals who signed a New
Year manifesto protesting the suppression of freedom in
Czechoslovakia, and grew to become one of the most vigorous
supporters of human rights in Eastern Europe.
   In Charter, religious activists worked with ex-Communists
expelled from the party in the purges that followed the crushing of
reform in 1968, wildly unconventional rock musicians met staid
intellectuals, young peace campaigners aligned with aging,
pre-World War II democrats.
   Maintaining that unity will be the tough task facing Chartists
in Civic Forum after free elections June 8, in which it is expected
to garner the largest share of the vote.
   These are very different worries from those of the past 13 years
battling the repression of Communist rulers who feared such broad
and potentially dangerous dissent.
   Men like Havel and Jiri Dienstbier, now Foreign Minister in the
post-revolutionary government, were constantly detained,
interrogated, watched and jailed.
   The harassment brought them international renown as defenders of
human rights and democracy in Czechoslovakia and Eastern Europe as
a whole.
   But Charter was also signed by hundreds of lesser-known
individuals who braved persecution to subscribe to the founding
document's ideals, exercising what Havel, in a famous 1975 essay,
dubbed ``the power of the powerless.''
   Stanislav Stransky, an upright 68-year-old, was one of those.
First jailed in 1948 by the Communists and forced all his life to
work only at menial, manual labor, he helped Charter by maintaining
an illegal printing press.
   For him, Sunday was a great day, ``because I met all these
people I only ever heard about.''
   During the Communists' rule, Chartists considered a gathering of
even 30 of their number a success over the secret police.
   On Sunday, about 2,000 people came from all over the country to
chat, listen to speeches and buy the once-underground publications
that as recently as last October earned their editors months in
jail.
   Mulling the future, however, Jan Urban, a prominent former
dissident who now heads Civic Forum, found trepidation clouding his
joy.
   ``On the one hand, it's beautiful to see all these people
together and to feel that something has happened,'' Urban said.
   ``On the other hand, it's frightening to see what may happen
very soon in this country, to see that after so many years of no
politics, people aren't prepared for the problems they will face.''
   Under a Stalinist system which politicized everything except
politics itself, Charter tried to initiate debate and a broad range
of political thought.
   Its members typed out by hand hundreds of documents discussing
issues from the environment to ethnic tensions, the economy to
women's rights.
   It was this activity that enabled Civic Forum to assume control
within just three weeks when the Communist hold on power crumbled
last November.
   ``Discussing all those things for such a long time, it made us
ready to serve,'' Urban said. ``At a moment of crisis, people were
able to go not to a stoker's place (Dienstbier`s former job), but
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.''

   President Najib told his ruling
Communist Party on Sunday that it should surrender its monopoly on
power and hold a special session to write the change into the
constitution.
   The announcement was made during a meeting of the Central
Committee of the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   The meeting also debated changing the ruling party's name.
   One choice favored by liberals was the National Unity Party.
Another, the People's Party, was supported by hard-liners. No
decision was made.
   ``The party should take voluntary, legal steps to cancel its
privileged status,'' Najib said in a speech to the Central
Committee, according to the official Bakhtar news agency. ``We must
give up our monopoly on power.''
   The meeting also removed 24 Central Committee members, but this
did not reduce the party's hold on power, as its members retained
control over all government ministries.
   Najib's speech was seen as an attempt to make himself and his
party more acceptable to U.S.-backed guerrilla groups, which have
been fighting his party more than a decade.
   Following the withdrawal of Soviet troops last year, the
guerrillas said Najib must step down before peace talks could begin.
   Afghan government officials said they interpreted Najib's
tentative steps toward political reforms as a sign of his weakness
and perhaps of the Soviet Union's unwillingness to back large-scale
change in Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union is Afghanistan's closest military and economic
ally. The Central Committee meeting was attended by high-ranking
Soviet diplomats and officials from the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
Afghan government officials said.
   Diplomats in Kabul have said a March 6 coup attempt has brought
Najib to his weakest position since being installed as president in
1986. A high-ranking government official said Sunday that about
half of the officers in the military are being replaced following
the insurrection.
   The coup attempt was led by Shah Nawz Tanai, who was defense
minister at the time. National security remains compromised because
Tanai escaped and joined forces with the guerrillas.
   Najib called for a meeting to modify references in Afghanistan's
constitution to the ``guiding role'' the party plays in national
affairs.
   The National Assembly meeting would be held within two months, a
government official said. It would include representatives from
Afghanistan's largely powerless National Assembly along with
appointed members from government ministries and important tribes
around the country.
   ``In spite of all our success, war still continues and the
people still suffer,'' Najib said. ``But we have taken steps toward
giving up the monopoly on power. Recently we've been going slowly.
We need to accelerate the trend toward democracy in our society.''
   Najib also said the ruling party would meet soon to revise the
party's charter, removing references to its Marxist past. The
structure of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan remains
Leninist, but over the last few years its ideology has begun to
change from Communist to nationalist.
   Free enterprise flourishes in Kabul, and the government has
lately begun allowing state-owned enterprises, such as Ariana
Airlines and the Continental Hotel, to operate as private
businesses.
   Eastern European diplomats cautioned against making parallels
between Afghanistan and Eastern Europe, where hard-line Communist
leaders have been ousted from power by popular revolutions that
Moscow allowed to proceed.
   ``Moscow doesn't deal with Kabul the way it does with
Budapest,'' said one diplomat. ``It treats Kabul like it treated us
in the 1950s. Afghanistan is more like a colony. We, at least, are
becoming independent.''
   Diplomats in Kabul say Moscow does not want Najib to adopt
reforms too quickly because that could hurt the bargaining position
with the United States, the main supporter of the guerrilla groups,
in future negotiations.

   Ann Landers says ``a lot of people need
professional help,'' including those who write excessively long
letters to advice columnists.
   The veteran agony aunt said she skimmed through 1,500 letters on
a flight Friday from Chicago to Seattle where she spoke to the
Northwest Women's Show.
   Letters on old themes, like those from teen-agers asking how to
get more attention from a potential mate, can be boring, she
admitted. And, naturally, she prefers letters that are reasonably
concise.
   ``Sometimes I'll get people who write 14 pages or so, but those
people are probably psychotic, though,'' she said. ``I tell them
they need professional help. You know, a lot of people need
professional help.''
   One recurrent theme is whether toilet paper should be hung over
the top or down against the wall.
   ``I'm very compulsive about it,'' she said. ``The toilet paper
needs to be hung down along the wall. I'll actually rearrange it
myself if I'm over at someone's home and I see it hung over the
top.''

   Dennis Quaid's surprise when a doctor made a
house call during filming of ``The Big Easy'' in 1984 got the actor
involved in trips to Central America as a chaperone of ailing
children.
   ``I just couldn't believe a doctor made a house call for me, and
I told him if there was ever anything I could do for him, ... ''
Quaid said. ``And he returned with, `As a matter of fact ...'''
   The doctor was Mayer Heiman, who has brought more than 100 sick
children from the world's poorest regions for treatment in U.S.
hospitals since he founded the International Hospital for Children
in 1981.
   Quaid returned to New Orleans on Saturday from his second trip
to Central America, escorting six children ranging in age from 6
months to 12 years.
   The youngest child, a Honduran, will have open-heart surgery.
The oldest, from El Salvador, will be treated for eye problems.
   ``This is such a special program for me because I get to work
directly with the children. It's a real hands-on experience,''
Quaid said, smiling at a 3-year-old girl in his arms.
   ``Everyone wants to do something in their life that helps
others,'' he said. ``If you save just one soul, then you feel like
you've saved the whole world.''

   Audrey Hepburn will team up with a symphony
orchestra to tell the story of Holocaust victim Anne Frank in music
and words.
   Miss Hepburn said she identified closely with the girl who
retained innocent hopes for the world despite her own predicament.
   She will narrate ``From the Diary of Anne Frank'' at its
premiere Monday night, the first of four ``Concerts for Life'' in
aid of the United Nations Children's Fund.
   ``It's a very, very important piece of music,'' said the
60-year-old actress, who collaborated with composer Michael Tilson
Thomas. ``I feel very privileged to be allowed to be the first
one.''
   ``If the words of Anne Frank have lived this long without it,
they will live forever with this music,'' she said.
   Miss Hepburn re-entered public life two years ago as a UNICEF
goodwill ambassador to help the world's needy children. Though she
retired from movies in 1965, she made a cameo appearance in Steven
Spielberg's ``Always,'' released in December.
   Miss Hepburn will narrate while Thomas conducts the New World
Symphony at the concert in the Academy of Music. Other concerts
will be held in Chicago on Wednesday, in Houston on Friday and
before the U.N. General Assembly in New York City next Sunday.
   Miss Frank, a Jewish teen-ager, and her family hid for two years
in an Amsterdam office building during World War II before being
captured by the Nazis. She later died in a concentration camp. Her
diary was first published in 1947.
   Miss Hepburn was born the same year as Miss Frank and lived in
Holland during the war.

   Marc Summers, who is host of ``Super Sloppy Double
Dare,'' isn't sure why the messy stunts in the cable TV game show
are so appealing to so many kids.
   Young contestants bombard each other with soda water and
bananas, or wade through molasses and baked beans, to earn points.
   ``There are some things about our show that I'll never
understand,'' Summers said. He brought the show to Dallas to give
its fans a close-up look at the mayhem.
   Summers knows of at least one adult who thinks the show isn't
the least bit funny. While passing out Halloween candy at his home
last fall, one woman realized who he was.
   ``She took one look at me and said, `You're that guy on ``Double
Dare!'' I hate your guts!'''
   Apparently, her son had duplicated a stunt from the show by
creating an obstacle course of ground coffee through the family
living room.
   ``I thought she was going to kill me,'' Summers said.

   Annelisa Schoen choked backed tears of joy as
she tried to express her feelings about East Germany's first free
elections Sunday.
   ``This is the greatest day of my life after being put down all
these years,'' whispered the 66-year-old woman.
   After four decades of Communist rule, East German voters were
filled with emotion and enthusiasm as they lined up at city polling
stations, and in rural areas at makeshift voting booths in pubs and
eateries.
   Adelgund Fernschild cast her ballot from a hospital bed in
Leipzig. Even former Communist Party functionaries and leaders
being held for alleged abuses in office were allowed to vote, the
official ADN news agency said.
   ``Before I couldn't choose. I could only hand in my ballot, and
today I can choose between many. This is a very special day,'' said
Elfriede Matzko, 53, as she strolled along in the sunshine after
voting.
   Her family was divided over the best candidate, and her daughter
voted for the Communists.
   ``But I am 53, and she is in her 20s. That makes a lot of
difference. I never could accept that they built the Wall, and
refused to let us travel for no reason,'' Mrs. Matzko said.
   She said she was looking forward to German unification. ``I
think we will have a good future. This is a very special day.''
   Karsten Simmert, 24, a trampoline artist with the East German
state circus, said he went to the polls first thing Sunday morning.
   ``I had the feeling that my vote counts. That I am helping to
decide something special,'' Simmert said.
   Ines Hohenstein, 27, brought her 5-month-old son along in a
stroller. ``We are very anxiously waiting to see what the results
will be tonight. We'll be in front of the television waiting for
the results,'' she said.
   ``My husband Hans and I are of the opinion that something must
happen here and that it won't come with the Social Democrats or the
Communists. We are going to vote CDU,'' Mrs. Hohenstein said.
   She was referring to the Alliance for Germany, a coalition of
three parties supported by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   About 12.2 million East Germans were eligible to vote in the
parliamentary elections, and they had 24 parties and organizations
to choose from. The broad slate perplexed some East Germans.
   ``Of course we're all happy that we can vote,'' said Christel
Wilke, a poll supervisor at a makeshift booth in a restaurant in
the village of Schoenwalde, 18 miles north of Berlin.
   ``But we have nothing we can draw from, no experience with the
new parties that we can use as a measure. There's no way we can
know if we are voting for the right person.''
   Most polling places opened at 7 a.m., but many shift workers in
industry were permitted to start voting two hours earlier.
   Wolfgang Koegel, an employee at a power plant in the
southwestern city of Suhl, was the first to vote in his district.
   ``No one really knows who's going to be elected. But by all
means I am for a better future, especially when I think about my
two children,'' he told the ADN news agency.
   Even prison inmates were able to vote. According to ADN, prisons
throughout the country set up private voting areas.

   A small aftershock of the quake that
rocked Upland last month jolted Southern Californians awake early
Sunday, but no damage or injuries were reported.
   The aftershock struck at 5:56 a.m. and measured 3.3 on the
Richter scale, said Robert Finn, a spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Its epicenter was 3 miles
northwest of Upland, he said.
   The Feb. 28 Upland earthquake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale
and caused nearly $13 million damage, the state Office of Emergency
Services estimated. Upland is 40 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally
felt by humans, while a quake of magnitude 3 can cause slight
damage. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage.

   The Air Force has failed to provide Congress
critical data on the B-2 stealth bomber, making it difficult for
lawmakers to take up the Pentagon's budget request, the chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee says.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., in a letter to Air Force Secretary
Donald Rice released Sunday, said his panel some time ago had
sought the results of laboratory and scale-model tests of the
radar-evading characteristics of the B-2.
   ``Regrettably, the Air Force has, to date, not submitted this
essential information to appropriately cleared committee staff
members,'' Aspin said in the letter dated March 12.
   Aspin said it would be ``difficult, if not impossible'' for the
committee to consider the Bush administration's fiscal 1991 budget
request for the stealth bomber.
   President Bush has proposed spending $5.5 billion and procuring
five B-2s in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The administration
hopes to buy 132 planes, considered the most expensive in history,
for a total cost of $70 billion.
   Air Force spokesman Maj. Dick Cole said Friday that Rice spoke
to Aspin on Tuesday, the day after the letter was written, and
pledged the service's full cooperation.
   A congressional source, who requested anonymity, said Friday
that the panel's chairman had received assurances that the
information will be forthcoming, but the committee still had not
received the data, which the Air Force has withheld despite
repeated requests.
   In a separate letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, dated
March 9, Aspin asked the Pentagon chief to provide to the committee
by March 31 an analysis of alternative plans for buying the stealth
bomber.
   The pricetag of $530 million per plane has sent shock waves
through Congress. Lawmakers have questioned investing in a costly
bomber in light of the rapid changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``It is essential that the committee understand precisely the
implications of reducing B-2 production for fiscal year 1991 and
beyond,'' Aspin wrote Cheney.
   The chairman suggested that the analysis consider the cost and
impact of reducing the buy of bombers in fiscal 1991 from five to
zero, one, two or three planes.
   Those same series of purchases should be assessed for fiscal
1992, fiscal 1992-1993 and fiscal 1992-1994.
   The Pentagon, in arguing for the fleet of 132 bombers, has said
any reduction in the buy will increase the cost of a single plane
to nearly $1 billion a copy.
   The department has invested more than $23 billion in the program
to date.

   The sky's the ceiling for Karla Taylor.
   Ms. Taylor specializes in painting skyscapes dotted with
majestic clouds on people's ceilings.
   But don't ask her to include un-sky-like things. Stars and moons
are OK; but no cars and no balloons.
   ``I had a request to do balloons,'' she said. ``I knew that was
not going to look good. All you would see would be the bottom of
the balloon.''
   Her parents might well be to blame for her artistic
proclivities. Her father was a house painter, her mother an artist.
   A ceiling takes about three days to complete and, for an average
room, the bill would be about $400, she said.
   Her business is looking up, she says, but not all the time. On
her studio floor, she's painted a rug.

   Can a television show that depicts Cincinnati
as a Midwestern backwater help the city's image?
   Sure can, say local leaders, if it's ``WKRP in Cincinnati.''
   The comedy series about the goings-on at a fictional Cincinnati
radio station is a welcomed contrast for a city bedeviled by the
Pete Rose gambling investigation and pollution problems at the
nearby Fernald uranium processing plant.
   ``I don't mind `WKRP,''' Mayor Charles Luken said. ``Obviously,
it makes us seem less than cosmopolitan on occasion. But I take the
attention the city can get where I can get it.''
   Producers hope to sell a syndicated version of ``WKRP in
Cincinnati'' to individual TV stations in the fall of 1991. The
original 90 episodes were first broadcast on CBS from 1978 to 1982.
   ``If you're asking if 10 companies will make their relocation
decision based on the revival of `WKRP in Cincinnati,' that
probably won't happen,'' said Roger Ruhl of the Greater Cincinnati
Chamber of Commerce.
   ``But is it a plus in Cincinnati's image arsenal? Yes. It
certainly creates an awareness or a hook to the city.''
   When Lois Smith joined the Greater Cincinnati Convention and
Visitors Bureau in the 1970s, the city didn't have much that
outsiders knew about.
   ``But once WKRP hit, it was immediate recognition,'' she said.
``It was one of the greatest things that ever happened to us,
publicity-wise.''
   At travel and trade shows, the visitors bureau began giving away
T-shirts with a Cincinnati skyline and the letters WKRP. The
souvenir shirts were grabbed up as fast as they were offered, she
said.
   Mike Rozow, vice president of public affairs and tourism for the
visitors bureau, is no less enthusiastic.
   ``It certainly isn't harmful to the image of the city,'' he
said. ``It's a fun show.
   ``We're not talking about a show that deals with brain surgery
here. It's a show that people enjoy. That enjoyability is
translated into the name of Cincinnati.''

Communist Party and other political and social groups began their
annual meeting Sunday, and Communist leaders urged them to improve
their ties with the masses.
   The deputies gathered at the Great Hall of the People for the
12-day meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, an advisory body that serves as a link between the
Communists and other groups.
   Chairman Li Xiannian, China's former president, presided over
the gathering, which included delegates from China's eight
sanctioned ``democratic'' parties and various mass organizations.
   The conference is held each spring concurrently with the annual
session of the National People's Congress, China's legislature. The
congress is to open its meeting Tuesday.
   The consultative conference has no political power and is
involved mainly in carrying out investigations and offering
suggestions to the Communist Party and the state on various social
and economic problems.
   The meeting is receiving attention this year. The Communist
Party, jolted by the collapse of Communist governments in Eastern
Europe, stresses the advantages of its system of Communist rule
supplemented by cooperation with non-Communist groups.
   Party leaders urged members to establish better ties with the
masses, to listen more closely to the ideas of the loyalist
democratic parties, and to promote more non-Communists to
government positions.
   ``Multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party must be persisted in and perfected and must not be
negated or weakened,'' the party's official People's Daily said in
a commentary marking the start of the meeting.
   The daily said it hoped consultative conference members will
``speak their minds freely, be active in offering suggestions and
... contribute to the country's stability and development.''
   Conference Deputy Secretary General Lu Zhichao said Saturday the
body ``contributes to scientific and democratic decision-making.''
   He also stressed the conference's ``full endorsement and
support'' for the political and economic policies of the party,
including the military suppression of the student-led pro-democracy
movement last spring.

<HEAD>Carter Says Syria Ready for Peace Talks With Israel</HEAD>

   Former President Jimmy Carter said Sunday he
believes Syrian leader Hafez Assad is ready to negotiate peace with
Israel.
   Carter told The Associated Press that after talks with the
Syrian president Thursday, he felt that Assad is ``ready to make
peace, under the framework of an international conference.''
   Carter, on the fourth leg of his Middle East tour, said such a
conference could set the stage for the direct negotiations that
Israel has sought.
   ``President Assad has told me ... that he would be very glad to
have bilateral direct talks with Israel to resolve all the
differences, including the Golan Heights,'' Carter told reporters.
   Asked if he believed that Assad would be ready to compromise on
the Golan, he said: ``I am not authorized to say, but I think he
would negotiate in good faith.''
   Israel captured the 450-square-mile Golan Heights in the 1967
Middle East war and annexed it in 1981. Israel has insisted the
strategic heights, which overlook the Sea of Galilee, are essential
to its security.
   A newspaper in the United Arab Emirates reported Sunday that
Syria will demilitarize the Golan Heights if Israel withdraws its
troops from the territory. The government-owned Al-Bayan said this
was the outcome of talks between the United States and Syria. The
paper did not say where or when the talks took place. It said they
were ``secret and high-level.''
   Carter met with Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, who told
parliament last week he ``received information from an
authoritative source that the Syrians are proposing peace
negotiations, demilitarizing the Golan Heights.''
   He refused to say if he believed Assad would agree to
demilitarization. U.N. peacekeepers have separated the two armies
in the Golan since former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
negotiated an agreement in 1974.
   Israel radio quoted Carter as telling Peres that Syria would be
willing to join in negotiations if there was progress in proposed
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   Syria, as well as nearly all Arab countries in the Middle East,
has refused to officially recognize Israel and has remained in a
technical state of war with the Jewish state since its
establishment in 1948.
   Only Egypt has signed a peace treaty with Israel in return for
the Sinai peninsula captured from it in the 1967 Middle East war.
Carter mediated in 1978 the peace treaty, known as the Camp David
Accords.
   Carter also met with caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
the right-wing Likud Bloc. Aides quoted Shamir as saying he was
ready to continue peace efforts on the basis of Carter's autonomy
plan for the occupied lands ``without the deviations that some have
tried to impose upon it.''
   Shamir referred to recent U.S. efforts to get concessions from
him on the participation of east Jerusalem Arabs in a proposed
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue and subsequent elections.

   A fire in a supermarket Sunday killed 15 people and
injured six, including two who jumped from a fifth-floor window to
escape the smoke and flames, officials said.
   It took 57 fire engines three hours to put out the blaze at the
Nagasakiya store in Amagasaki, 300 miles west of Tokyo, said fire
official Hiroshi Kawamoto. The cause of the fire was being
investigated.
   Kawamoto said the fire broke out on the fourth floor of the
five-story supermarket shortly after noon.
   He said all 15 fatalities probably died of smoke and gas
inhalation.
   The victims were found on the fifth floor, where the employees'
cafeteria, offices, a storage area and a game center are located.
   Of the six injured people, two were in the game center when the
fire broke out and jumped from a window. They were seriously
injured by their falls.
   Kyodo News Service quoted employee Shizue Nomura, 70, as saying
she was having lunch in the employees' cafeteria with several
others at noon.
   ``I heard the words, `Fire! Fire!' and tried to flee, but smoke
suddenly came down on us,'' she said.
   Mrs. Nomura said she and three other people were able to escape
by climbing down from the roof to a neighboring building.
   The fire was the worst in a large retail store in Japan since
1973, when more than 100 people were killed in a fire at Taiyo
Department Store in Kumamoto.
   Nagasakiya operates 122 stores throughout Japan.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is off
to Africa on Sunday with the aim of helping to end apartheid in
South Africa and seeking a cease-fire in a 14-year war in Angola.
   In five fast-paced days, Baker also will attend ceremonies
marking the independence of Namibia and hold meetings with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The celebration of a new nation's birth, attended by dozens of
world leaders in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, is a springboard
for Baker to meet also with Nelson Mandela, the South African black
activist, and with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   Baker's aides made clear before his departure that the Bush
administration has no intention of yielding to Mandela's demands
for stiffer sanctions against South Africa and that it would not
recognize Angola until the Luanda government settles with the
U.S.-armed UNITA rebels based in the southern part of the country.
   But Baker also is ready to assure Mandela that the
administration would keep pressuring President F.W. de Klerk of
South Africa to free all political prisoners and to end a 3
1@2-year state of emergency. That stance puts Baker somewhere
between the Mandela and de Klerk camps.
   His plan on Angola, meanwhile, is to seize on the current
military stalemate to call for negotiations between the government
and UNITA rebels headed by Jonas Savimbi. Savimbi receives $35
million to $40 million in covert U.S. aid annually, according to
congressional sources.
   Baker will follow up on his Windhoek talks by seeing de Klerk
and Foreign Minister R.F. Botha in South Africa on Thursday.
   On Friday, Baker's aides said he would tour Soweto, the black
township outside of Johannesburg and visit with Walter Sisulu, an
African National Congress official like Mandela, and Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, a anti-apartheid activist. Later in the day, Baker
will fly to Zaire for a meeting with Jonas Savimbi, the head of the
UNITA group.
   But Sisulu said in a telephone interview in South Africa that he
and his wife, Albertina, will skip the meeting with Baker because
the couple has plans to travel to London on March 21. Two other ANC
officials, Govan Mbeki and Raymond Mhlaba, will likely see Baker,
Sisulu said.
   Tutu said he expects to meet Baker, but details have yet to be
confirmed. Tutu's aides said the meeting might be held in Cape Town
rather than Johannesburg.
   Mandela, whose meeting with Baker is to take place in Namibia,
has refused to see the American official on South African soil,
saying he opposes ``high-profile visits'' to South Africa. ``They
(the visits) suggest that President de Klerk has done something
positive, something fundamental which requires the world to review
sanctions ...,'' he said.
   De Klerk, who freed Mandela from prison last month, has invited
the 71-year-old Mandela and exiled black leaders to begin
negotiations on April 11.
   The move was welcomed by the State Department. Both sides _ the
white community and black majority _ were credited with deciding to
approach an end to apartheid through negotiations rather than
confrontation.
   ``We're very happy at most recent developments, which we think
represents a real change in the thinking in that country,'' a
senior U.S. official said Friday.
   In Angola, Baker believes the time is right to promote a
cease-fire in part because the two sides have been at a military
stand-off in Mavinga, a Savimbi stronghold, since December.
   The United States is alone among Western countries in
withholding diplomatic recognition to Angola, although that country
has developed a private economy and ships 75 percent of its oil to
the United States through Chevron and Conoco.
   Washington has protested Soviet support for Angola and the
presence of Cuban troops in the country.
   About half of the 50,000 Cubans have left under a complex
agreement that also ended South African control over Namibia. The
rest are supposed to depart by next year.
   But Soviet aid, even though it is decreasing, ``continues to be
humongous.'' the senior U.S. official said. ``We're talking about a
decrease from about a billion dollars a year to $600 million.''
   ``We're not asking for the overthrow of the government,'' the
official said. ``We are not asking for any type of regime. We're
not asking that Jonas Savimbi be made president of Angola.''
   Signalling U.S. conciliation, he went on: ``All we're asking for
is for the government of Angola to reconcile with a major dissident
organization which represents a significant number of Angolan
people.''
   In the event of ``a new political order,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, ``we will be very happy to bow
out.''

<HEAD>Bush Team Divided on Soviet Threat, Defense Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disagreement inside the Bush administration
over the possibility that drastic changes in the Soviet Union will
be reversed is raising new questions about the size of the U.S.
defense budget.
   While CIA Director William Webster testified earlier this month
the political changes in the Soviet Bloc are irreversible, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney has maintained that Moscow could reassume its
former confrontational pose.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas S. Brady said Sunday that the
administration is still sticking with Cheney's proposed $3.2
billion cut in inflation-adjusted defense spending for fiscal 1991
beginning next Oct. 1.
   ``Three billion dollars is it; that's what Secretary Cheney
says; that's what it is,'' Brady said on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation'' program. ``That's our position at this point in time.''
   Webster's testimony, however, is one indication of disagreement
within the administration, particularly between Cheney and White
House Budget Director Richard Darman, over whether bigger defense
cuts might be acceptable.
   A senior White House official who refused to allow his name used
was quoted by The New York Times on Sunday as saying the
``irreversibility'' of changes in the Soviet Union makes deeper
military spending cuts possible.
   The newspaper quoted senior administration officials as saying
they were willing to acquiesce to total cuts of $10 billion to $11
billion but adding that Cheney was still fighting ``the emerging
consensus.''
   A cut of $10 billion to $11 billion would produce a fiscal 1991
defense budget of $296 billion to $297 billion defense, roughly the
same as this year, compared to the $303 billion Pentagon spending
plan that Bush submitted to Congress in January.
   Brady called the Times story inaccurate, saying, ``I've sat in
all of these discussions and there has been no talk about a $10
billion cut.''
   Meanwhile, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.,
called Sunday for a $20 billion cut in the Pentagon's budget or ``3
percent less for defense than what we spent last year.''
   Bolstering the case for further slashes in defense spending was
the House Armed Services Committee chairman's interpretation last
week of a classified Joint Chiefs of Staff assessment of military
strength.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said the service chiefs now believe the
United States and its allies could fight and hold off the Soviet
Union in Europe without resorting to nuclear weapons.
   ``I look at this net assessment and I say, we win. We can go the
other way. NATO wins, the good guys win,'' Aspin said.
   The Pentagon based its assessment on the Soviet Union's
unilateral troop reductions announced by President Mikhail
Gorbachev in December 1988 and the U.S. intelligence community's
conclusion last year that the Soviet threat has lessened.
   The Joint Chiefs also took into account the U.S.-Soviet treaty
expected later this year to reduce conventional forces. That pact
would create an imbalance with the United States keeping 30,000
troops on the flanks in addition to the 195,000 U.S. and Soviet
forces in Central Europe.
   One aspect under fire in Cheney's spending plan is an $80
million increase over last year to develop a short-range nuclear
missile as a replacement for the ground-based Lance missile.
   The new missile would be deployed principally in West Germany,
but officials there have criticized creating a weapon that's
principal targets would be in East Germany, Poland or
Czechoslovakia.
   ``The follow-on to the Lance does not make sense given the
change in the European borders,'' said Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.,
a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   McCurdy said the administration's call for the program reflects
a ``policy that has not caught up to the reality of the
environment.''
   Aspin predicted last week that Congress would not fund the
Pentagon's request of $112 million for the program.
   Democrats say Webster's comments juxtaposed against Cheney's
failure to take advantage of the changes in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union provide them with an opening to craft their own
defense agenda for the future.
   ``This gives the Democrats the opportunity to establish policy
in this vacuum that's good for America and good for the party,''
said McCurdy.
   Another top member of the panel, Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass., said Cheney's five-year defense plan should be forthcoming
and once that is in hand, the Democrats should put forth their own
policy.
   ``The Democratic Party has got to strike out. We have not done
that,'' Mavroules said last week. ``We have to take both arguments
(Cheney and Webster) and then formulate our own policy.''
   Republicans contend Democrats will continue to argue for
significant cuts in defense spending but will turn parochial when
it comes to determining where the cuts will be made.
   ``The real battle is in the jobs bill,'' Rep. John Rowland,
R-Conn., said of the defense budget. ``I've never seen such
confusion or indecision.''
   The oft-stated GOP strategy is to paint the Democrats as
budget-conscious only when someone else's district is involved.

   The money awarded to Nobel Prize
winners is being raised this year to $653,000 each from $489,000,
the head of the Nobel Foundation was quoted as saying Sunday.
   The foundation is hoping to eventually make the prize _ after
inflation _ worth what it was in 1901, said Stig Ramel. His
comments appeared in the Svenska Dagbladet.
   In 1901, the first year the Nobels were awarded, the prize money
was 150,000 kronor. In today's terms, that would be $784,000. Last
year's prizes were worth about $489,000 each.
   Svenska Dagbladet said this year's increase in prize money was
secured by a planned sale of the foundation's 22 percent stake in
the real estate company Bevaringen. Further increases are planned.
   The inventor of dynamite, Alfred Nobel, created the Nobel prizes
in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.
   In 1968, Sweden's central bank instituted a sixth prize, the
Nobel memorial economics prize, which carries the same prize sum as
the others.
   The Nobels are awarded in September and October.

   The small ultra-Orthodox religious faction that
helped topple the Likud-led government announced Sunday it will
support the right-wing Likud to form a new coalition government
much like the last one.
   The announcement by the Shas, or Torah Guardians, came as
President Chaim Herzog opened meetings with political leaders to
decide who will form the next Cabinet.
   Shas legislator Yair Levy said his party based its
recommendation on concerns that right-wing extremists could take
control of the government and hamper peace efforts.
   ``So we asked that there be a national unity government in order
to be able to advance the peace process,'' he told reporters.
   The Likud leader, Yitzhak Shamir, had refused to accept
U.S.-backed compromises that would have sped up the long-stalled
peace process. This led to his downfall Thursday in a vote of
non-confidence in parliament.
   Five of the six Shas lawmakers abstained from supporting Shamir
in the vote, which led to the collapse of the so-called unity
government of Likud and the center-left Labor Party.
   ``We believe and hope that after what happened that even Likud
will understand without a peace plan it is very difficult to
exist,'' Levy said.
   In a rare TV appearance, Shas spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, criticized Shamir's policy saying it ``invited bloodshed and
war upon Israel.''
   ``One man sins and everyone else must suffer?'' Yosef asked. He
added that his party's move to continue to support Likud was based
on sentiments of its constituents.
   The Shas' reversal may influence Herzog in naming the next prime
minister.
   Israeli newspapers have reported that Labor leader Shimon Peres
appeared to be Herzog's likely choice.
   Herzog was expected to announce his selection this week. But the
actual formation of a government could take weeks or months as
Likud and Labor seek to form alliances.
   The outcome depends greatly on four small religious parties,
including Shas. Their 18 members in the Knesset, or parliament,
hold the balance of power in the 120-seat body.
   The result could be a coalition of right-wing and religious
parties led by Likud; a leftist-religious coalition headed by
Labor; another Likud-Labor Cabinet or _ if all else fails _ new
elections.
   Shamir remains caretaker prime minister until there is a new
government.
   Labor is technically parliament's largest faction with 39 seats.
Likud has 35 but also controls a five-seat liberal faction.
   Peres, 66, was quoted by the national Itim news agency as
expressing confidence he could put together a governing coalition.
   ``There are 70 legislators who support the peace initiative, in
my opinion,'' said Peres, listing religious, left-wing and Arab
parties. ``However, I know the difficulty of getting everyone
together under one roof.''
   Levy said his party did not recommend who should lead Likud in
forming the government, but the right-wing party's leaders called
Sunday for the 74-year-old Shamir to again be given the task.
   Party leaders made the announcement after Likud parliament
members headed off a rebellion against Shamir Saturday night with
the surprise backing of former Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, the
prime minister's arch rival.
   Sharon, who resigned from the Cabinet last month with sharp
criticism of Shamir, praised the prime minister for standing up for
Likud principles rather than accept the compromise and back U.S.
peace proposals.
   ``With full awareness that he would lose his position and that
the government would collapse, Shamir stood for our principles,''
Sharon said. ``We must support someone who would do that.''
   Israeli news reports said some Labor and religious leaders want
Herzog to name former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin instead of
Peres to form a new Labor-led government. Rabin is Labor's No. 2
man and a longtime rival of Peres for the party's leadership.

   A mild-mannered former consultant who
authorities say killed his wife, mother and three children and then
lived quietly for 18 years under an assumed name now passes his
time in his jail cell reading the Bible.
   Lawyers for John E. List and prosecutors, meanwhile, are busy
preparing for trial starting Tuesday and jockeying over whether a
five-page letter List left behind, intended for his pastor, can be
used as evidence.
   ``It's been categorized over the years as a somewhat detailed
diary of events,'' said Lt. Bernard Tracy, the latest in a long
line of Westfield detectives handling the case since 1971.
   Police believe that List's wife, Helen, 45; his 85-year-old
mother, Alma; and their children Patricia, 16, John Jr., 15, and
Frederick, 13, had been dead about a month when their bodies were
found Dec. 7, 1971, in the mansion the family shared in Westfield,
N.J., a New York City suburb.
   List, who had written notes to his children's teachers saying
the family would be away for a few weeks, had vanished. Police were
finally called to the house when neighbors noticed that lights that
had been left on in the house had burned out.
   When authorities entered the house, they found religious music
blaring from a radio and the wife and children's bodies lined up
neatly in sleeping bags in the ballroom. List's mother's body was
found in her upstairs apartment. All had been shot to death.
   Police also found the letter, addressed to List's pastor. Its
contents have never been detailed, but reportedly, List claimed he
was distraught over his family's wavering religious convictions.
   As police searched for List, the abandoned 18-room mansion
became a landmark for thrill-seeking teen-agers. It burned down
mysteriously a year after the bodies were found.
   List, now 63, remained at large until last June, when the crime
was featured on the Fox television show ``America's Most Wanted,''
along with a plaster bust of what List might look like nearly two
decades later.
   Several people recognized List as the man they knew as Robert P.
Clark, a married accountant living in Midlothian, Va. Although Army
fingerprint records showed that Clark and List were the same
person, the defendant conceded only last month that he is indeed
List.
   List's attorney, Elijah Miller Jr., said the concession was
necessary for legal reasons to file the evidence motions.
Prosecutors must still prove List's identity.
   Defense attorneys will argue that the police search of List's
home was illegal and that the letter to his pastor is protected by
``priest-penitent'' privilege. Confidential communications with a
pastor can be held privileged under New Jersey rules governing
trial evidence.
   The state will argue that the letter ``does not meet the
requirements of the evidence rule,'' said Assistant Prosecutor
Eleanor Clark, declining to comment further.
   Even before the routine pretrial arguments are made, however,
Superior Court Judge William L'E. Wertheimer said he will choose a
jury, with selection to begin Tuesday. The jurors then will be sent
home with instructions to ignore publicity about the case.
   Wertheimer imposed the unusual schedule _ pretrial motions are
usually decided before jury selection _ to reduce the exposure of
prospective jurors to news accounts. The judge said he will then
decide pretrial matters, including the letter. The document has
never been released, although authorities have discussed some of
its contents.
   List felt his family's religious convictions were wavering and
that he had to kill them for their own good, police familiar with
the case said. Investigators also said List was in financial
straits _ that he had two mortgages on the Westfield home, was
failing as a financial consultant and had been siphoning money from
his mother's $200,000 savings account.
   Others have said that List may have been distraught over his
wife's drinking and his daughter's desire to be an actress.
   List gets few visitors as he awaits trial at the Union County
Jail, said Warden Warren Maccarelli. He said List is separated from
the general prison population for ``safety concerns'' and spends
his time reading the Bible and other religious works.
   ``We continue to have him on our prayer list,'' said the Rev.
Joseph M. Vought of the Lutheran Church of Our Saviour in Richmond,
Va., where List, as Clark, was a member for several years.
   Aside from the letter, the state plans to introduce the usual
evidence of murder trials: ballistics reports, medical and
fingerprint evidence, and testimony by the officers who searched
the house, the prosecutor said.
   Those pieces of evidence, even without the letter, are enough to
bring List to trial, said Tracy.
   ``I think there are five real important pieces lying on the
ground with bullet holes in them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Four Americans Kidnapped Briefly in Mexico On Spring Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Americans on spring break were
held against their will and threatened by a group of Mexicans
before a police cruiser passed by and rescued them, Mexican police
say.
   Three Matamoros, Mexico, residents face a judge Monday on
charges of deprivation of freedom in the incident, which began
early Friday.
   The three college students and a friend, all from the Oklahoma
City area, had been visiting bars in Matamoros and were heading to
the Gateway International Bridge to return to Brownsville when they
accepted a ride, said Marland Crabtree, one of the Americans.
   ``As soon as we got in, they turned around and started to drive
really fast,'' said Crabtree, 25. ``They drove us all over town
going at about 100 miles an hour through city streets and running
stop signs.''
   Last year, a University of Texas student was kidnapped in
Matamoros while on spring break and was killed at a nearby ranch,
allegedly by members of a drug cult. Fourteen other bodies were
also found at the ranch.
   Crabtree, his brother Darren, 19, Jeff Jones, 21, and a
19-year-old woman told police they were held for about three hours,
threatened with death and taken to a vacant warehouse. The woman,
who was not identified, said she was sexually molested.
   The abductors were ordering the Americans to go into the
warehouse when Matamoros police officer Ruben Morales Gonzalez
drove by about 3:30 a.m.
   ``I saw them there, and I thought it was strange for them to be
at that side of town at those hours,'' said Gonzalez. ``When I
stopped, one of them raced toward the car and told me they were
taken against their will. Then I called for reinforcement.''
   Darren Crabtree said the Americans feared for their lives when
the abductors told them to go into the warehouse.
   ``At that point we thought they were going to kill us because
last year those people got killed during spring break,'' said
Marland Crabtree. ``They were telling us that we better go in
because they had a gun.''
   Gonzales said it was unlikely that he would have spotted the
Americans if they had been in the car, since its windows were
tinted black.
   The Oklahomans told the Brownsville Herald they could not get
out of the car's back seat because it had electric-powered windows
and child safety door locks.
   The Oklahomans were kept at the Matamoros jail until Friday
afternoon because Mexican officials feared they would leave the
country without telling a court reporter what had happened.
   The three men arrested were Jesus Rangel Gonzalez, Oscar Garcia
Velazquez and Olga Lidia Castillo, all of Matamoros.

<HEAD>Seven Killed In Black Factional Fighting In Natal Province</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Seven people were killed in
fighting between black factions in Natal province, and one man was
burned to death, police said Sunday.
   About 3,000 blacks have been killed since 1987 in Natal province
in fighting between supporters of the African National Congress and
members of Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha party.
   Buthelezi returned from a visit to Lusaka, Zambia, on Sunday and
said that nation's president, Kenneth Kaunda, had offered to act as
a mediator between the factions.
   Buthelezi said he had not asked Kaunda to take on the role, but
that the president was the only person with the necessary
credentials.
   ``He has the confidence of the ANC leadership and I have always
had confidence in him _ and he has had no problem with me over the
years,'' Buthelezi said.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela has offered to meet with Buthelezi and
his uncle, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, but no date has been set.
   Buthelezi and Mandela have had years of friendly contact. But
Buthelezi says ANC leaders in exile in Zambia have called for his
assassination, and he has criticized them for their support of
bombings and economic sanctions as ways to end South Africa's
apartheid.
   According to a daily unrest report issued by police, six blacks
were killed by other blacks in Natal province during the previous
24 hours and a seventh was killed by police during the clashes. It
said seven blacks were arrested in the fighting and that nine
people were injured, three of them policemen.
   In one incident in Imbali, outside the Natal provincial capital
of Pietermaritzburg, police said a group of blacks attacked a
house, stabbed a man in the chest with sharp instruments, poured
paraffin over him and set him on fire.
   In violence elsewhere in the country, police said a man was
killed and two were injured when officers fired shots at a group of
black men attacking Zulu migrant workers living in a hostel in
Boteleng township near Johannesburg. Police said when they arrived,
the attackers turned on them and officers fired a shotgun at the
crowd.
   Police said gasoline bombs were thrown at two black policemen's
houses in Botaleng, but caused no injuries.
   During the past six weeks, more than 300 blacks and one white
man have been killed in violence, including black factional
fighting and riots against police in black townships and rural
homelands throughout the country.
   Mandela, who returned from a five-nation tour Saturday, said the
violence reflected black rejection of apartheid, but that the ANC
would try to stop it.
   Some government officials, including President F.W. de Klerk,
have blamed black leaders for instigating the violence, saying they
are not ready to negotiate a peaceful solution to the country's
race problems.

<HEAD>Three Pilots Accused of Drunken Flying to Appeal License
Revocations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Northwest Airlines pilots accused of
flying a commercial jetliner from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis while
intoxicated will appeal their license revocations, two attorneys
said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board will hear the appeals
April 3, said attorneys representing Robert Kirchner, first
officer, and Joseph Balzer, second officer on the March 8 flight.
   The Federal Aviation Administration revoked the licenses of
Kirchner, of Highland Ranch, Colo.; Balzer, of Antioch, Tenn.; and
Capt. Norman L. Prouse, of Conyers, Ga., March 9 after its
investigation showed the cockpit crew boarded the flight within
eight hours of drinking, the federal limit.
   Northwest fired the three pilots on Friday following its own
investigation, saying they had violated the company's stricter
rules prohibiting drinking less than 12 hours before flying.
   Bruce Hanley, the Minneapolis attorney who represents Balzer,
and Mark McDermott, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing
Kirchner, said Saturday that their clients maintain Northwest or
the FAA could have stopped the flight.
   The two attorneys told the Star Tribune that Northwest had
enough information to ground Flight 650 before it left Fargo with
91 passengers aboard. Northwest has declined to discuss what role
it played before takeoff.
   Hanley said all three members of the cockpit crew also will
appeal their dismissal by Northwest through their union, the Air
Line Pilots Association.
   ``Northwest is trying to polish its own public image by putting
the blame on the pilots,'' said McDermott, a former FAA attorney
and vice president of the bar association that represents
individuals before the transportation board.
   McDermott said it was ``ludicrous'' that Northwest or the FAA
could not have stopped the flight.
   Only three Northwest crews were staying overnight in Fargo the
night before the flight, McDermott said. Northwest said it got an
anonymous telephone tip at midnight, six hours before takeoff, that
a ``Capt. Sugo'' had been drinking in a Moorhead bar, but did not
find the name on its pilots roster.
   McDermott said he finds it difficult to believe Northwest would
not have checked out the three crews.
   At 2:15 a.m., four hours before takeoff, the FAA contacted
Northwest about an anonymous tip and went to the airport to meet
the crew before the takeoff.
   Northwest refuses to comment on what actions it took before the
departure.
   Hanley said a Northwest gate agent ``had to have seen'' the
three pilots before their departure. ``If they (the FAA and
Northwest) perceived there was a problem, they should have stopped
them,'' Hanley said. ``There's no question the plane would not have
taken off without proper clearance.''
   McDermott said he will challenge the results of blood-alcohol
tests of the three pilots conducted by the Hennepin County Medical
Center. Those tests showed the three all had blood alcohol levels
above the legal limit. FAA regulations prohibit concentrations of
.04 percent or above.
   On the issue of time lapse between drinking and flying,
McDermott and Hanley said they will contend that their clients
stopped drinking before 10:30 p.m. The plane was scheduled to
depart at 6 a.m., did not take off until 6:25 a.m.
   All three pilots were met by an FAA inspector before they took
off. The inspector called other FAA officials after the plane
departed. An FAA inspector then joined airport police to meet the
Boeing 727 jetliner when it landed at Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport.
   The inspector executed a citizen's arrest, and the three were
taken into custody by police.
   In addition to having their licenses revoked and being fired,
the three pilots also could face misdemeanor charges of flying
while intoxicated. Such charges are being considered by authorities
in both Minnesota and North Dakota.

<HEAD>Indian Troop Pullout From Sri Lanka Nearly Complete</HEAD>

   The commander of the Indian
peacekeeping force said Sunday the last of his troops would
withdraw by the end of the week, leaving the towns and jungles they
once patrolled to the guerrillas they were sent to disarm in 1987.
   More than 1,155 Indian soldiers were killed in the 2{-year
peacekeeping operation, the longest foreign venture by the world's
fourth-largest army.
   ``If the weather remains as it is, I expect to pull out the last
contingent by March 24,'' Lt. Gen. Amarjit Singh Kalkat told
reporters at China Bay, one of only two military camps in Sri Lanka
still occupied by Indian troops.
   About 5,500 soldiers remain in northeastern Sri Lanka, down from
an estimated peak of 125,000 at the height of the jungle war
against the Tamil Tiger guerrillas who once again move openly on
the streets of Trincomalee.
   The guerrillas waged war against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese-dominated
government since 1983 before turning their guns on the Indian
peacekeepers. They have entered the political process but have not
given up arms.
   Kalkat said the Indian mission had accomplished its purpose.
   ``The aim was to bring normalcy for the democratic process to go
through, and it went through,'' the general said.
   ``At this point, that military group (the Tigers) is saying they
have full faith and confidence in the (Sri Lankan) government,''
Kalkat said. ``At the same time, the government of Sri Lanka is
reposing full faith in the militant group and is dealing with
them.''
   He also said the Indian army had learned valuable lessons about
``operating in a politico-military environment.''
   ``In these kinds of operations, the military and political
strategies directly contradict each other,'' Kalkat said. ``This
was the biggest onus on my commanders.''
   In Trincomalee, a town of 50,000 people, the Indians' departure
went largely unnoticed. The fish market was crowded, and men stood
in groups near the town's solitary cinema, waiting for the show to
start.
   There was no sign of civilian administration. Instead, a young
man in green fatigues with a Czechoslovak revolver appeared to be
in charge.
   ``We have taken over,'' he said, identifying himself as A.
Ruban, a senior member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   ``You've seen the situation,'' Ruban said in the Tamil language.
``Our cadres are enough to maintain peace.''
   The Tigers took over the town March 10 after the Indian troops
withdrew to China Bay and the pro-Indian Tamils running the
provincial government fled.
   Tiger guerrillas and the Sri Lankan soldiers and police they
once fought now share law and order duties. While soldiers and
police operate checkpoints and guard some government buildings, the
Tigers roam Trincomalee in convoys of pickup trucks, brandishing
machine guns and automatic rifles.
   ``Within three months we will have elections,'' he said. ``Until
then, we have to create and maintain an atmosphere of trust.''
   The Tamil revolt began in 1983 to press demands for a separate
homeland in northeastern Sri Lankan for their ethnic minority. More
than 11,000 people have been killed since then. At least 6,000 more
died in a Sinhalese backlash against the government and its peace
overtures to the Tamils.
   The Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, claimed they were discriminated against in jobs and
education by the Sinhalese, who form 75 percent of the population.
   The Sri Lankan army, made up almost entirely of Sinhalese,
initially attempted to crush the revolt with an all-out attack on
Tamil areas. Tamil guerrillas responded with attacks on the
government troops and massacres of Sinhalese civilians.
   Neighboring India, which has a politically powerful Tamil
minority of its own, tacitly supported the insurgents and tolerated
guerrilla training camps on its soil.
   On July 29, 1987, an Indian-sponsored plan giving the Tamils
limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender was signed by
the New Delhi and Colombo governments. India said it consulted
Tamil leaders about the proposals.
   India also agreed its troops would enforce the surrender. But
the Tigers reneged on the deal and turned their guns on the Indians.

   Soviet military jets repeatedly streaked over the
capital of Lithuania during military maneuvers Sunday, one day
before a Moscow deadline demanding that the Baltic republic
renounce its declaration of independence.
   At the same time, however, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
struck a conciliatory tone, saying he still planned to talk with
the Lithuanians about returning to the Soviet fold. And he said
there had been no ultimatums.
   ``We will carry on the dialogue,'' Gorbachev told reporters
Sunday after voting in runoff elections, which were held in Russia
and other parts of the Soviet Union's Slavic heartland.
   Also Sunday, 50,000 to 100,000 Lithuanians demonstrated against
independence at a rally in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital. Soviet
television said the demonstration included calls for civil
disobedience and for the creation of workers' squads to secure
order and defend socialist property against the secessionist
government.
   The size of the protest, shown on national television, damaged
the Lithuanian government's claim that the population fully
supports secession. Gorbachev has said he is concerned for the
rights of non-native residents and fears that splitting the Soviet
Union would prompt hundreds of thousands to migrate.
   On Sunday, he continued to insist that Lithuania's March 11
independence declaration was illegal and must be decided by the
entire Soviet Union, not just the republic. He said economic,
political, cultural and technical ties were too strong to tear
apart and ``human contacts have become particularly deep.''
   He added that he would work for a new federation agreement that
would satisfy everyone.
   The Soviet military maneuvers surprised the Lithuanian
government, parliamentary spokesman Vladslovas Panumis said in a
telephone interview. But military officers told Lithuanian
President Vytautas Landsbergis that the training had been planned
in advance, Panumis said.
   A Westerner in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, said it was
unclear whether there were many planes landing at a military base
or whether it was just one or two jets making repeated passes over
the city.
   The Baltic Tribunal, an emigre newspaper in Copenhagen, says
there are eight military bases in Lithuania, including one near
Vilnius. At least 1 million Soviet troops are believed to be
stationed in Lithuania, which is on the Soviet Union's western
border.
   Another parliament spokesman quoted Lithuanian Premier Kazimera
Prunskiene as saying the military maneuvers on the border with
Latvia and in southeastern Lithuania seemed to be routine and there
was no cause for concern.
   Telephone communications between Lithuania and the West were out
of order Saturday and Sunday, but it was possible to telephone to
the republic from Moscow. A shift supervisor for the Moscow central
telephone office said the international telephone channels to
Lithuania were closed down Saturday for maintenance work and she
had no idea when they would be restored.
   The Soviet Parliament on Thursday directed Gorbachev to defend
Soviet interests and citizens in the Baltic republic of 3.8
million. It declared the Lithuanian move illegal and the Soviet
Constitution still in force.
   Gorbachev on Friday sent Landsbergis a telegram giving him until
Monday to respond to how the directive is being realized. He did
not say what the Kremlin would do if the Lithuanians refused to
respond. He and his aides say they have ruled out the use of force.
   On Sunday, Gorbachev said the telegram was not an ultimatum.
   ``I think we shall receive a reply from the authorities of
present-day Lithuania and, depending on what it is, everything will
become clear. The character and content of the answer will define
our next steps,'' he said.
   ``We shall act responsibly with a view to realizing the
aspirations of the Lithuanian people from the viewpoint of
strengthening their independence and sovereignty, but at the same
time, within the scope of cooperation with all republics,'' he said.
   Landsbergis and aides met Sunday to draft a response stating
that Lithuanian law will observe the legal rights of the Soviet
Union and protect national minorities. On Saturday, Landsbergis
appealed to democratic nations for official recognition of his new
government.
   Meanwhile, a military helicopter had dropped leaflets on Vilnius
calling voters to an anti-independence rally on Sunday.
   Demonstrators at the rally called the newly elected Lithuanian
parliament's declaration of independence ``an anti-constitutional
coup.''
   I. Kucherov, a Communist Party member who remained loyal to
Moscow when the majority of the Lithuanian party split from the
Soviet party in December, said on the evening news show ``Vremya''
that he called for civil disobedience and for government workers to
refuse to carry out separatist orders.
   Sunday's protest was sponsored by the Vilnius Communist Party
and Young Communist League, the Edinstvo pro-Russian movement, the
Socialist Federation of Workers and the Council of Veterans of War
and Labor.
   The crowd was estimated at 50,000 by a correspondent and at
100,000 by Soviet television and the Lithuanian Interior Ministry.
   The leaflets dropped by the helicopter stated: ``Who asked if we
agreed?'' according to one read to The Associated Press over the
telephone by Gintautas Alksneses, a member of Sajudis.
   The leaflet accused the independence activists of representing
``those who owned bourgeois Lithuania and disposed of the fates of
people, sold Lithuanian land and factories to foreign capital and
cost hundreds of thousands of Lithuanians their jobs, forcing them
to flee the country in search of bread.''
   The leaflets also demanded a referendum on the question of
independence, which was declared a week ago by the first freely
elected parliament in Lithuania in 50 years.

<HEAD>Opera Opens in Amazon After Eight Decades of Silence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After eight decades of slow decay, the
renovated Teatro Amazonas has opened a new season of opera in the
19th century Belle Epoque building in the heart of the Amazon
jungle.
   The 659-seat opera house was two-thirds full Saturday night for
an evening of Brazilian classical music, arias and part of
Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos' ballet ``The Amazon Forest.''
   The audience, in tuxedos and evening gowns, were special guests
of state Gov. Amazonino Mendes. He authorized the $8 million,
three-year renovation of the building, which first opened its doors
in 1896 when a rubber boom had made Manaus one of the richest
cities in the world.
   About 300 people demonstrated on opening night to protest the
cost of the renovation at a time of economic crisis. Inflation in
Brazil was 2,700 percent during the past 12 months and poverty is
widespread.
   ``The people paid, the people want to enter!'' protesters
shouted before police moved in and dispersed the crowd. No one was
injured.
   The night's entertainment also suffered from technical
difficulties. During the Villa-Lobos ballet, the sound system went
out and the performance had to be restarted.
   The neo-classical opera house with its multicolored, tiled dome
roof, painted ceiling by Crispim de Amaral and plush interior with
velvet-covered chairs, was built with the money of the rubber
barons who dominated the city in the late 1800s.
   The barons, who boasted of their sophistication, spoke French
and sent their white shirts to be laundered in Europe. Chandeliers
and mirrors came from Venice, tiles from Marseilles, marble from
Carrara and lampshades from Paris.
   A new opera house in Paris, the Opera-Bastille, made its own
debut Saturday with a performance of Hector Berlioz' ``The
Trojans.''
   The Teatro Amazonas, about 1,700 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro, had been silent for most of the past 83 years, fizzling
with the end of the rubber boom.
   After a 1907 performance, the theater was mostly abandoned, with
only an occasional play or concert performed on its once glorious
stage. By the early 1980s, time, rain, and termites had nearly
destroyed the building.
   The head-to-toe renovation included a paint job for the pink
pastel facade, 36,000 new tiles and a sound system.
   More than 3,000 gallons of insecticide were injected into the
wood to prevent termites from eating the building a second time.
   The legendary rise and fall of the Teatro Amazonas was the
subject of German director Werner Herzog's movie, ``Fitzcarraldo.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ At least four masked thugs broke
into an elite Roman Catholic school for girls Sunday and assaulted
the resident sisters with clubs and machetes, a French diplomat
reported.
   Four French sisters and one Haitian sister were hospitalized
with injuries. The thugs attacked eight St. Joseph of Cluny sisters
and tried to strangle them, French ambassador Jean Raphael Dufour
told The Associated Press.
   Dufour said one was stabbed in her bed at the St. Rose of Lima
girls school in the capital, Port-au-Prince.
   ``One has the feeling the motive wasn't only money,'' he said of
the incident, which occurred early Sunday morning. He indicated the
reasons might be political but did not elaborate.
   The thugs took money and files when they fled, he said.
   The French-based St. Joseph of Cluny religious order last year
celebrated its 125th anniversary in Haiti, where it runs several
schools.
   Dufour said he planned to meet with provisional president Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot Sunday evening to protest the incident.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was inaugurated Wednesday after a weeklong
popular uprising toppled the military government of Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl called Sunday's
election victory by the East German coalition he helped promote a
clear mandate for swift reunification.
   Kohl, who made frequent trips to East Germany to campaign for
the three-party conservative alliance, also urged East Germans to
stop migrating to the West and begin rebuilding their country.
   Official returns reported by East Germany's ARD television gave
victory to the conservative Alliance for Germany, a three-party
coalition.
   The big showing by conservatives in East Germany's first free
elections was a huge personal victory for Kohl. Based on television
projections, the alliance captured the largest single bloc of seats
in the new East German parliament.
   Kohl, conciliatory in the face of victory, called for a broad
governing coalition in East Germany, where political groups in
recent months largely have been shaped by the principal West German
parties.
   ``This first truly free, direct vote is a historical event,''
Kohl said at a news conference in Bonn. ``The events in East
Germany, the most peaceful revolution in the history of the German
people, made it possible that it came to such an election.''
   The East German conservative alliance is led by the Christian
Democrats, sister party of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. The
East German Christian Democrats favor quicker reunification than
the rival Social Democrats, whose party was supported by the West
German Social Democrats.
   West German Social Democrats have accused Kohl of using the
reunification issue to fan German patriotism and boost his own
standing in the West German elections in December.
   They said the conservative victory in East Germany was based on
unrealistic expectations and promises made by their counterparts in
the West. They accused Kohl of promising the relatively
impoverished East Germans a rosy future if they merge their nation
quickly with prosperous West Germany.
   Oskar Lafontaine, the probable top candidate for the Social
Democrats against Kohl, said the chancellor will now have to uphold
his ``big promises.''
   ``The decisive thought for East Germans may have been, ``If we
vote for Kohl, the money will flow,''' Lafontaine said in an
interview with the ARD television network.
   Kohl said the projected election results were a mandate for
reunification and Western-style democracy.
   ``The East German citizens have decided against every form of
extremism,'' Kohl said. ``Most important, they want to follow a
path, together with West Germany, that will lead to unification.''
   The new East German government is likely to exist only long
enough to negotiate the details of the unification of the nations.
   Kohl said East German voters had ``clearly rejected'' the
Communists, who reconstituted themselves as the Party for Social
Democracy and were projected to finish third in the balloting.
   The chancellor urged East Germans to stay at home and help
reconstruct a new country, a reference to the tens of thousands of
East Germans who have fled to West Germany in the past year.
   ``My message at this hour is: Stay home,'' Kohl said.
   ``Work with us in your villages, cities and communities, in your
factories and in your local administrations to build up this
beautiful country.''

of two brothers wanted for questioning in the firebombing of a U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration office, a spokesman said.
   The bombing early Saturday caused $4 million in damage but no
injuries, and came two days after the brothers were indicted on
drug charges.
   John Lewis Ciganek, 22, was arrested on the drug charges, said
agent Brian Kensel, speaking for the FBI team investigating the
bombing. He declined to give details of the arrest.
   Authorities continued searching for Jeffrey A. Matthews, 23,
formerly known as Jeff Ciganek.
   Kensel said the FBI wanted to talk to the brothers about the
bombing but declined to label them or anyone else prime suspects.
   ``There have been no warrants issued in connection with the
explosion,'' he said.
   Last month, federal drug agents told sheriff's deputies that
Matthews had threatened DEA property during a drug investigation,
according to Lee County Sheriff's Department records.
   The fire following the bombing gutted the 6,000-square-foot,
one-story building at a shopping and business mall, agency
officials said. The drug agency was the building's only tenant.
   Kensel said investigators determined that the blast was caused
by a pipe bomb, and that a ``liquid accelerant,'' probably
gasoline, was used to spread the fire.
   Following the bombing, Sheriff John McDougall ordered deputies
to guard at least 13 prosecutors, judges and law enforcement
officials who were part of a joint task force investigating and
prosecuting drug dealers in his southwestern Florida county
   McDougall called the bombing ``a declaration of war.''
   He said protection might be extended to others, such as jurors
and witnesses, who participated in a recent federal grand jury
probe of drug trafficking.
   Guards were posted at the federal courthouse and the office
building that houses the U.S. attorney's local office.
   The bombing is also being investigated by the state Department
of Law Enforcement and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   Matthews and Ciganek, who were investigated for at least three
months, were indicted Thursday on two counts each of conspiracy to
distribute cocaine, officials said.
   A third man and a woman, Kenneth Bird Sr., 41, and Kelly
Susskind, 20, who were indicted on the same charges, were arrested
Friday. They were being held without bond in the county jail.
   The eight to 10 employees who worked at the destroyed building
will find a new office in the same city, officials said.
   ``The Drug Enforcement Administration is not leaving Fort Myers.
The Drug Enforcement Administration is here to stay,'' said Gregory
Kehoe, first assistant U.S. attorney from Tampa.
   Three hours before the bombing, a pipe bomb exploded outside the
Fort Myers home of Gary Wicall, a fire inspector who investigated
other bombings over several months at Fort Myers Beach.
   ``Someone's sending me a message. Someone wants to scare me. But
frankly, they've just angered me,'' Wicall said.

<HEAD>Flooding Continues Across South, Snow in Northeast, Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Record flooding continued to swamp the South on Sunday, and
scattered snow fell across sections of the Northeast and the
Midwest.
   Floods that began late last week continued in Alabama,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, eastern Tennessee and the
Carolinas, as well as in northeast Texas and New England.
   In Georgia, Kinchafoonee Creek, Little River and Murder Creek
reached record flood levels. In Vinings, the Chattahoochee River
reached its highest mark since a flood in 1946.
   In southern Alabama, two days of flooding left at least 3,500
people homeless and killed eight others by Sunday. Damage in the
town of Elba alone, where a levee broke Saturday, was estimated in
the millions of dollars.
   The Tallapoosa River neared the record level reached in 1961 at
the Tallapoosa, Ala., water plant and was still rising. The Alabama
River was expected to crest about 3 feet higher than a damaging
flood in April 1979 in Montgomery and Selma.
   Scattered snow fell on parts of Colorado, Iowa, Illinois,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania and New York.
Rain fell from Illinois to Iowa and from Missouri to Kansas.
   Advisories for blowing, drifting snow were posted for western
Minnesota.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 6 degrees in
International Falls, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees in Detroit Lakes, Minn., and Ely, Minn., to 82 degrees in
McAllen, Texas.

<HEAD>Report: Biaggi in Halfway House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Mario Biaggi has been transferred
from the federal prison in Texas where he's been serving a 2{-year
sentence for bribery to a halfway house in the city, New York
Newsday reported Sunday.
   The newspaper quoted unidenitified sources as saying the former
10-term Democratic congressman from New York arrived at the
Brooklyn halfway house on Friday.
   Biaggi was convicted in 1987 of accepting illegal gratuities _
vacation expenses for himself and his girlfriend _ from
then-Brooklyn Democratic leader Meade Esposito in exchange for
seeking federal help for one of Esposito's insurance clients.
Esposito was also convicted in the case.
   In addition, Biaggi was convicted of interstate travel to commit
a crime and obstruction of justice.
   He served 11 months of the 2{-year sentence at a
minimum-security prison in Fort Worth.
   It was unclear how long Biaggi would spend at the halfway house,
a six-story, brick-faced building with terraces, where inmates live
in dormitories and may hold outside jobs, New York Newsday said.
   In a separate case last year, Biaggi was convicted of extorting
payoffs from the Bronx-based Wedtech Corp. in return for using his
political influence to help the defense contractor.
   Biaggi is appealing his conviction and eight-year sentence in
that case.

   Pro-democracy activists claimed victories Sunday
in local Moscow and Leningrad elections, while Latvians and
Estonians in their first free vote in 50 years elected parliaments
that activists hope will press for independence.
   Crucial runoff elections were held in Russia, Byelorussia and
the Ukraine. The areas make up the Soviet Union's Slavic heartland,
accounting for about 80 percent of its territory and two-thirds of
the country's population.
   From Moscow to Vorkuta in northern Russia, reformers ran against
Communist Party and government officials.
   In Moscow, the pro-democracy bloc claimed 10 of 14 contested
seats in Sunday's runoff, said Irina Boganseva of the Voters' Club.
   Pro-democracy activists in Leningrad claimed many victories in
individual races and estimated they would control at least 65
percent of the city council, said Elena Zelinskaya of the Northwest
Information Agency. Early returns showed only one Communist Party
official winning a seat, she said.
   Further results were not expected until Monday and official
tallies were days away.
   In the two Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia, annexed by
the Soviet Union in 1940, supporters of independence movements
hoped their candidates would emerge victorious, following the
example of nearby Lithuania.
   Lithuania's parliament was taken over by independence supporters
in elections in February and early March, and the lawmakers
declared the republic independent on March 11.
   The Soviet Congress declared the move illegal and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave the republic three days to
respond. The deadline expires Monday, but Gorbachev has offered to
hold talks with the Lithuanians.
   Latvia followed Lithuania and legalized alternative political
parties several months ago. Estonia has not removed the Communist
Party's constitutional guarantee on power but a variety of
political parties put forward candidates without interference.
   The Soviet Parliament legalized multiple political parties for
the entire country Tuesday, but that was too late for strong
movements to form in the heartland of Russia, Byelorussia and the
Ukraine.
   In Latvia, average voter turnout was 75 percent, the republic's
Electoral Commission said. The pro-independence Latvian People's
Front nominated 185 candidates out of the total 390 competing for
the 201 parliament seats.
   Election officials said 69 percent of the contenders there are
Communists, including some People's Front members, the official
Soviet news agency Tass said.
   People Front's spokeswoman Anda Anspoka said the front hoped to
gain a two-thirds parliamentary majority ``to fight for
independence.''
   Thousands of Popular Front supporters rallied in the Latvian
capital of Riga Sunday, urging voters to support their movement. At
least five other parties, including the Green or environmental
party, competed in the Latvian elections, Tass said.
   Estonian journalist Michael Taro predicted the People's Front
would win about 35 of the 105 seats in Estonia, with 15 or 20 more
going to other pro-independence groups.
   In Estonia, about 63 percent of the voters turned out by 2 p.m.,
said Annu Laido of Estonia's Electoral Commission. The lowest
turnout at that point was 54 percent in Tartu.
   In the three Slavic republics, voters chose between candidates
in some 1,610 runoffs, held after no candidate gained 50 percent of
the vote in the main round on March 4.
   ``According to data reaching us, voter turnout today is somewhat
lower,'' than on March 4, secretary of Russia's electoral
commission Anatoly Petrov told Tass. Turnout by noon was especially
low in Western Siberia, between 26 percent and 27 percent.
   In Moscow, officials reported a 57 percent turnout after the
polls closed.
   ``I think people want to participate, because they believe that
things would change for the best, that these are the first
democratic elections. For the first time, we have alternative
candidates'' for the republic and local councils, said Ivan Petrov,
chairman of the electoral committee at a polling station in
Moscow's Kievsky district.
   Tensions ran high at some Moscow stations, located in libraries,
movie houses or schools. The runoffs put many members of the
Democratic Russia group, a coalition of reformist radicals, against
party bureaucrats, police officials and nationalist candidates.
   In Moscow's Proletarsky district, former political prisoner
Victor Bulgakov faced Yuri Gorbachev, a local KGB official, a
Moscow activist said.
   And in Vorkuta, where coal miners have staged repeated strikes,
mine engineer Victor Yakovlev faced Soviet coal industry minister
Mikhail Shadov.
   Some reformers accused political rivals of playing down the
importance of the elections in the hope that insufficient turnout
would require a new election, giving the conservatives a second
chance. Soviet law requires at least 50 percent of the voters to go
to the polls for an election to be valid.
   Mikhail Zarapin, a reformist candidate who lost in the March 4
round at the Tagansky district and now functions as an independent
observer in the elections, said he felt people were just too
ignorant.
   ``They don't really know the candidates. Some would take the
three ballots and just cross out the first name in each of those.
Others think they should cross out people from outside their
district,'' he said.
   Candidates were not required to run in the district where they
live.
   Another Russian said people were tired of the Soviet Union's
new-found political games and did not believe elections would
change much.
   ``I have to vote,'' one young woman said as she emerged from the
voting booth. ``But frankly, I would rather not vote for any of
them.''

   Lothar de Maiziere, who may become East
Germany's first democratically elected premier, leads a party that
once supported the ousted hard-line Communists in a puppet
parliament.
   He has tried to deal with his party's past by openly
acknowledging mistakes and wrongdoing, and his strategy seems to
have worked.
   West Germany's ARD television network, reporting official
returns, said late Sunday that the conservative Alliance for
Germany, led by de Maiziere's party, had won East Germany's first
free elections. That put de Maiziere in an excellent position to
become premier.
   His Christian Democrats are the leading party in the Alliance
for Germany, which is backed by West Germany's governing Christian
Democrats.
   ``We have an enormously large responsibility,'' de Maiziere told
reporters during a frenzied celebration at party headquarters
Sunday night. He is a fervent supporter of quick unification with
West Germany.
   The bearded, 50-year-old de Maiziere sidestepped questions about
becoming premier.
   ``I don't want to talk about personnel questions tonight. I
don't want to burden the coalition negotiations,'' he said. ``I
just want to celebrate.''
   It was another remarkable scene in the political transformation
of Eastern Europe. Until last fall, de Maiziere's party was one of
the four controlled by the hard-line Communists.
   De Maiziere, who became party chief after last fall's popular
East German revolt, has acknowledged his party was financed by the
Communists in exchange for its parliamentary support. He has also
admitted that some Christian Democratic leaders stole party funds.
   The party leader, who is descended from a prominent Huguenot
family, has even said his party's past will make a fresh start in a
democratic East Germany very difficult. Many East Germans now
openly despise people who supported the ousted hard-line Communist
regime.
   De Maiziere has not devoted his life exclusively to politics. He
is a lawyer and talented viola player. For many years, he headed
the Lutheran Church Council.
   He rose to prominence after the popular revolution last fall as
deputy premier in the caretaker government of reform Communist Hans
Modrow.
   In the election, however, his party embraced support from West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. De Maiziere,
who is married with three daughters, has strong personal ties to
West Germany.
   His uncle, Ulrich de Maiziere, held a top post in the West
German army. His cousin, Thomas de Maiziere, is the West Berlin
spokesman for West Germany's Christian Democrats.

   A Honduran airliner carrying 25
Americans home from a diving trip crash-landed on Roatan Island in
a Caribbean rainstorm Sunday, and four passengers were slightly
injured, an airline official said.
   Marcos Briceno, manager of TAN-SAHSA airlines, said in a
telephone interview the four Americans were treated for minor
injuries at a hospital on the island and released a few hours later.
   Briceno said sharp, strong winds suddenly whipped the old DC-3
plane as it was landing on the island's beachside airstrip
``towards its right side ... until the wing and the engine on that
side came to rest in water'' off the runway.
   The aircraft was a twin-engine, propeller driven plane dating to
World War II, when it was widely used to ferry American troops to
and from Europe.
   Briceno said the plane, with a crew of four, had taken off
``normally'' from the Island of Guanaja for the 45-mile flight to
Roatan. The twin islands in the Caribbean, about 280 miles
northeast of Tegucigalpa and 43 miles off the mainland, are resorts
favored by divers because of the clear water surrounding them.
   ``The plane took off normally from Guanaja at 6:03 a.m. and ...
was landing at 6:28 a.m. at the Roatan airstrip when it happened,''
Briceno said. ``There were 25 passengers on board, all American
men.''
   Briceno said the passengers, members of a Miami-based diving
tour, had arrived Saturday in Guanaja after a stop at La Ceiba, a
port on the Honduran mainland.
   ``They will stay the night at a luxury hotel in Roatan and all
are returning to Miami tomorrow,'' he said. ``The accident was due
to the heavy rains and winds whipping the Caribbean region at the
time and not to mechanical failure or human error.''
   He said a passenger list was not immediately available.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone and an airline
communications employee, Roberto Siallas, earlier also confirmed
the accident had occurred.

   Coast Guard crews used vacuum trucks Sunday
to suck up a hazardous chemical solvent that spilled into the
Delaware River while being unloaded from a Norwegian tanker.
   The spill forced the evacuation of about 250 people from a
three-block area in northeast Philadelphia on Saturday. Six police
officers and five workers at a pier near the spill were treated for
headaches and nausea after breathing fumes of the chemical, cumene.
   Coast Guard officials said 12,843 gallons of cumene, which is
used in fingernail polish remover, spilled aboard the Jo Rogn, and
a small, undetermined amount ran into the river.
   Fifteen workers used six vacuum trucks to remove a 20,000-gallon
mixture of water and cumene, said Coast Guard Lt. Robert Mitchell.
The chemical appeared as a ``light film'' on the river's surface,
and by 1 p.m. no noticeable spill remained, he said.
   The cleanup was to resume Monday morning, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Louis Moore.
   The tanker was carrying 3.2 million gallons of cumene, which is
a fire hazard and dangerous if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed
through the skin.
   Most of the cumene was contained and put into a slop tank, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Richard Minnich. A small amount leaked
into the river, but most of it evaporated quickly, he said.
   ``A suspect valve appears to be the source,'' Minnich said.
``Apparently the (ship) sensors said it was OK, but it was found to
be open or partially open.''
   Because the slop tank contained other material, Coast Guard
officials said they could not estimate how much of the cumene was
recovered from the river. The main concern was not aquatic or
marine life, but fire hazards, they said. The Fire Department
declared the emergency under control about noon Saturday, four
hours after the spill was reported, and allowed the estimated 250
evacuees to return home.
   The spill occurred when the tanker was unloading the chemical
into a holding tank at Unitank Co. The tanker is owned by Odfjell
Shipping, of Bergen, Norway and the shipping agent was identified
as AspenShipping Co. in Philadelphia, Mitchell said.
   Harold Yates, a spokesman for the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, said the water at a sewage treatment plant about a mile
north of the pier will be monitored. But he said there was no
danger of contamination of drinking water because the nearest
source for water on the Delaware River is upstream.

   The people who began the revolt
that brought down a Communist dictatorship already were looking
Sunday beyond the elections made possible by their bold defiance.
   The pro-democracy fervor that exploded in Leipzig last year was
replaced by quiet contemplation Sunday, when East Germans held
democratic elections for the first time.
   Despite the free balloting, many residents instead focused on
the inevitable reunification with West Germany.
   Bernd Fischer, a 29-year-old engineer, said he took pride in
last fall's demonstrations. ``Totally new things were being created
then. Now, especially after the election campaign, that feeling was
gone.''
   ``The only point of the vote was to shape a Germany to be united
as soon as possible,'' he said. ``We hope the election will bring
us progress _ good work, good pay and good life for all.''
   He and his wife, Kerstin, 27, said they voted for the German
Social Union, a Leipzig-based rightist party calling for quick
unity.
   ``It was uplifting moment,'' said Seigmar Maywald, 50, after he
voted. ``What was born in the demonstrations reached its peak in
the elections.''
   But his companion, 34-year-old Evelyn Werner, said: ``We can't
rest on our laurels _ just keep on saying that we're heroes.''
   ``It's enough politics for now. The rest we must achieve through
hard work,'' Maywald added.
   Activists in Leipzig, East Germany's second-biggest city, began
the huge demonstrations that forced the ouster of hard-line
Communist leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18.
   The movement was initially led by grass-roots reform groups that
held huge rallies every Monday in Leipzig. Later, conservatives who
supported swift German unity began dominating the rallies.
   But downtown Leipzig was quiet on election day. Services at St.
Nicholas Church, a focal point of the demonstrations, drew sparse
gatherings.
   Signs that reunification with West Germany was on the minds of
many were evident in the Western newspapers, fresh oranges and
electronics that were brought from across the border and hawked on
the streets.
   For 87-year-old Luise Woithon, the election was a chance to
ponder a dark past. She remembered four decades of rigged Communist
voting and the 1932 elections that put the Nazis in power.
   ``We're hoping for better times,'' she said.
   The Rev. Christian Fuehrer, Lutheran pastor at St. Nicholas, was
among the driving forces in the revolution's early days and helped
lead the call for free elections.
   ``Now we have to build the rule of law in East Germany,'' he
said. ``A single German state is inevitable, but it has to come
from within a European framework.''
   Fuehrer voted for Alliance 90, a somewhat leftist group that
includes New Forum, once the most influential opposition group. The
alliance is expected to have only token representation in the new
freely elected parliament.
   Despite its terrible showing, New Forum still held a
post-election party.
   ``We expected an outcome like this,'' member Ralph Lange said
with a shrug. ``But it is a little worse than we thought.''

   Robin Harris, a comedian and actor who appeared
in the movies ``Do the Right Thing,'' ``Harlem Nights'' and ``House
Party,'' was found dead in a hotel room Sunday, officials said. He
was 36.
   Harris gave a comedy show Saturday night at the Regal Theater
and apparently died in his sleep at the Four Seasons Hotel, said
Ardenia Brown of Jam Productions Ltd., promoter of the show.
   He was found by his mother, who accompanied him to Chicago, and
was declared dead on arrival at 9:02 a.m. at Northwestern Memorial
Hospital, said hospital administrator Shirley Jackson.
   An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death,
according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.
   A Chicago native, Harris moved to Los Angeles with his family
when he was 8. He performed at black nightclubs in the Los Angeles
area after graduating from Ottawa University in Kansas.
   Harris played the role of Sweet Dick Willie, a middle-aged black
man who hung out on a street corner in Spike Lee's 1989 film, ``Do
the Right Thing.''
   ``I couldn't write that character as funny as Robin could,'' Lee
said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times last summer. ``He
has a sophisticated country wit. He was born in Chicago and raised
in L.A. but he reaches way back to Mississippi.''
   Harris had recently filmed an HBO comedy special at Chicago's
Vic Theater and also appears in Lee's upcoming film, ``Love
Supreme,'' Brown said.

   A motorist struck a woman with his car
Sunday, then opened fire on passers-by and killed one man before
seriously wounding himself, witnesses and police said. Five people
were wounded by the gunfire.
   The incident began about 2 a.m. as people left clubs and
discotheques in the city center.
   A car knocked down a young woman, and when a bystander tried to
talk with the driver, the motorist got out and started shooting,
witnesses said. Police said the man shot indiscriminately at
passers-by with a 9mm Browning pistol.
   Thomas McIntyre, 20, was killed, and three women and two men
were wounded, police said.
   Three of the wounded were treated at Glasgow Royal Infirmary for
minor injuries and then released, a hospital spokesman said Sunday.
One person was in serious condition and another in critical
condition, he said.
   The 22-year-old woman hit by the car, was being treated for leg
and back injuries.
   The gunman was in intensive care at the hospital, said police
detective superintendent Dennis Mair. Police would not identify the
24-year-old man, and they gave no motive for the shooting.

   Five top contenders for U.S. Oscars won British
academy awards Sunday, with the American drama ``Dead Poets
Society'' named best film of 1989.
   Pauline Collins was named best actress for her portrayal in
``Shirley Valentine'' of a housewife who escapes boredom in
Liverpool and finds fulfillment in Greece. Miss Collins, giving her
thanks, said it was a brave decision ``to put a middle-aged
unknown'' in a major film.
   Daniel Day Lewis took best actor honors for his portrayal of
crippled Irish writer Christy Brown in ``My Left Foot.'' Accepting
the award from actress Angela Lansbury, Day Lewis expressed his
``lasting admiration'' for the late writer.
   Kenneth Branagh was named best director for ``Henry V,'' in
which he played the title role. The 29-year-old actor had also been
nominated for best actor.
   American writer Nora Ephron walked off with the award for best
original screenplay for ``When Harry Met Sally,'' a comedy about a
decade-long friendship that turns into love.
   ``Dead Poets Society,'' the story of an inspirational
boarding-school teacher played by Robin Williams, beat ``My Left
Foot,'' ``Shirley Valentine'' and ``When Harry Met Sally'' for the
best film award.
   In addition, Maurice Jarre's music for ``Dead Poets Society''
was honored for best original film score.
   Miss Collins, Day Lewis, Branagh, Ephron and the ``Dead Poets
Society'' have been nominated for Academy Awards, which will be
announced in Los Angeles next Monday.
   The British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards films
released in Britain in 1989. Oscar hopefuls such as ``Driving Miss
Daisy,'' ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``The Fabulous Baker
Boys'' did not open in time to be considered.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' a 1988 Oscar nominee, received 10
British nominations and won two awards: Michelle Pfeiffer was named
best supporting actress for her portrayal of the virtuous woman led
astray and Christopher Hampton won for best adapted screenplay.
   In the U.S. Oscars, Miss Pfeiffer is nominated as best actress
for her role as a nightclub singer in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   Irish actor Ray McAnally won a posthumous award as best
supporting actor for his role as Christy Brown's father in ``My
Left Foot,'' his final film role before he died last year. The
choice was greeted with cheers.
   The best film in a foreign language was Frenchman Bertrand
Tavernier's ``Life and Nothing But'' about the emotional havoc
wrought by World War I.
   A host of celebrities from both sides of the Atlantic attended
the black-tie awards ceremony at the Grosvenor House Hotel.
   The celebrity presenters included actors Sean Connery, William
Hurt and Ben Kingsley. Actress Jodie Foster was also a presenter.
   Princess Anne, president of the British Academy, presented its
Special Award for 1990 to Dame Peggy Ashcroft, 82, for her dominant
role in British show business for half a century.
   The princess also presented a special award for outstanding
British contribution to cinema to veteran director Lewis Gilbert,
70. His latest film was ``Shirley Valentine.''
   In television categories, the best actress award went to Diana
Rigg for her role as the obsessive, homicidal mother in ``Mother
Love.''
   The best actor award was given to John Thaw for his work as
``Inspector Morse,'' a sour, crossword-loving detective from Oxford.

   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat pledged Sunday to defend
Libya ``with our blood'' from U.S. threats, state-run Libyan Radio
reported.
   The radio, in a report monitored in Rome and London, said Arafat
spoke Sunday after a meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
   The leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization said he had
told Gadhafi of the Palestinians' ``solidarity with the Libyan Arab
people and its leader, who are facing U.S. threats,'' Libyan Radio
reported.
   ``We will stand by our people in the Great Jamahiriyah (Libya)
with our blood,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Arafat was apparently referring to U.S. charges that a plant at
Rabta, 60 miles southwest of Tripoli, was producing chemical
weapons. Libya says it makes pharmaceuticals.
   Earlier this month, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
he did not rule out a U.S. military strike to shut down the factory.
   Fire swept through the plant on Wednesday and Libya has accused
the United States and West Germany of involvement.
   The radio said Arafat left Tripoli Sunday afternoon, but did not
say how long he had stayed. Arafat is a frequent visitor to Libya.

   Bodyguards overpowered a gunman who
rushed up to a Croatian opposition leader in an apparent
assassination attempt Sunday, a television report said.
   The incident occurred in the town of Benkovac in southwestern
Croatia, an area mainly populated by Serbs, during a meeting to
establish a local branch of the Croatian Democratic Union party,
Yugoslav television said.
   An unidentified man brandishing a pistol tried to approach party
leader Franjo Tudjman, but bodyguards pounced on him as he ran
toward the rostrum, the report said.
   The man was injured in the scuffle and taken away by the police,
the television said. Tudjman reportedly was unhurt, but the meeting
was discontinued.
   Tudjman, a historian and former Yugoslav army major-general, was
sentenced in 1971 to two years in jail. He was accused of extremist
Croatian nationalism during a purge of Croatian leadership.
   Last year, he re-emerged on the political scene when he
announced the formation of the Croatian Democratic Union, which has
been accused by Yugoslav authorities of stirring up Croatian
nationalism.
   The Union, which reportedly has more than 200,000 members and
plans to contest next month's parliamentary elections in Croatia,
has been criticized particularly in Serbia.
   Tudjman has complained about Serbian leadership as well.
   Serbia and Croatia are the two largest of Yugoslavia's six
states.
   The Croatian Democratic Union has also been sharply denounced by
Serbs in Croatia, who claim the party is ideologically similar to
the extremist nationalist organization of Ustashas. The Ustashas
were SS-like units in the army of the Croatian puppet state set up
by Nazi Germany when it occupied Yugoslavia in 1941.
   The Croatian group has rejected the comparison.

<HEAD>At 86, Al Hirschfeld Still Learning His Art</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHADDS FORD, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Al Hirschfeld's caricatures of theater
personalities have graced the pages of The New York Times for six
decades. But the master of line drawing is not done learning.
   ``All I know is that when it works, I'm aware of it. But how
it's accomplished, I don't know,'' said Hirschfeld, who turns 87 in
June.
   Now, 98 of his works _ 31 of them originals _ are featured in a
traveling exhibit that premiered Saturday at the Brandywine River
Museum, the first of 15 stops on a U.S. tour organized by the Trust
for Museum Exhibitions.
   The mainly black-and-white exhibit gives viewers plenty of
chances to search his subjects for the hidden name of his daughter,
Nina, a Hirschfeld trademark.
   Hirschfeld said the exhibit puts his ``early sins prominently on
display.'' But his illustrations from the 1920s through the 1980s
also show his development as an artist.
   ``Through trial and error you eliminate and eliminate and get
down to the pure line and how it communicates to the viewer,''
Hirschfeld said Friday. ``The last drawing you do is the best one _
it should be.''
   Hirschfeld spends his days finding the right lines to make the
face, be it Sidney Poitier or Oliver Hardy. His seemingly simple,
sweeping stroke catches Mikhail Baryshnikov in air, Fred Astaire
dancing up a wall or Leonard Bernstein conducting an orchestra.
   Using basically an ``s'' on its side and a couple more sweeping
strokes, he creates the folded arms of Peter Ustinov in an
imaginary ``Odd Couple'' role as Oscar Madison, part of an
``Unlikely Casting'' series done for Playbill.
   His lines can be heavy to create the eyes, nose and mouth of
Zero Mostel as Tevye in ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' or hundreds, maybe
thousands of sharp wisps to capture his black, bushy beard.
   Margo Feiden, whose New York galleries house several of the
works in the exhibit, said Hirschfeld is doing his best work now.
   ``It's very clearly defined now,'' said Ms. Feiden, who is
Hirschfeld's agent. ``It's very distilled. ... One day he's going
to be able to draw a dot in the middle of the page and we're going
to be able to know who that is.''
   Hiding the name of his daughter in his work began in
Philadelphia. Nina was born in 1945 while he was making a sketch
for the Philadelphia opening of the play ``Are You With It?'' so he
put her name in the background. He kept hiding Nina's name for a
while, and when he tried to stop, public demand wouldn't let him.
   He can't get a handle on the fascination, which once led to a
$60,000 Pentagon grant to a University of Pennsylvania professor to
study the search for Ninas. He thought it was ``insane'' and was
even less impressed when the professor told him the work would help
pilots read maps.
   ``You drop a pebble in the water and the ripples never cease,''
he said.

   There is no evidence that two U.S.
helicopters crashes that killed 11 Americans last month were caused
by terrorist attacks, the U.S. military said Sunday.
   ``We are still investigating, but we are treating the matter as
an accident because there are no indications in the aircraft that
it was an attack,'' said a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command
who asked not to be further identified.
   Leaflets signed by the Dec. 20 Movement, or M-20, and
distributed in the western city of David claimed responsibility for
the Feb. 21 crashes near Colon, at the northern end of the Panama
Canal.
   The fliers also said the group was responsible for the March 2
bombing of a discotheque in Panama City that killed one American
soldier and injured 28 other American soldiers and Panamanians.
   ``The helicopters were flying in the middle of a storm,'' the
Southern Command spokesman said Sunday, repeating the cause given
at the time.
   The spokesman declined to comment on M-20, which takes its name
from the date of the U.S. invasion that overthrew dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The Panamanian government has not acknowledged the group's
existence, but officials have said pro-Noriega groups exist and
were likely to have access to weapons caches believed still hidden
in the country.
   A communique from the Government and Justice Ministry on
Saturday said 26 AK-47s and one Falk automatic rifle were
confiscated Friday in security operations for the David
International Fair.
   The agricultural and crafts fair, which attracts Americans and
visitors from neighboring countries, opened Friday.
   The M-20 leaflets said the group formed as a result of the U.S.
invasion and that its ``principal ojective is everything that
smells of gringos.''
   It threatened to kill U.S. soldiers and attack American property
and the David fair.
   A member of the communist Party of the People was arrested
Friday in David for distributing the fliers, and officials said two
other members were sought.
   However, the Panama City daily La Prensa on Sunday quoted a
party official as denying any ties between the party and the group.
   ``Any attempt to link any member of our party with actions that
vary from the PP line is a fabrication that reflects the beginning
of a witch hunt in this country,'' Luther Thomas, the party's
international relations secretary, was quoted as saying. ``We do
not know about an M-20 group or any other group of this type.''

   Bozo, they still love you.
   After a 10-year freeze, a Chicago television station opened the
phone lines Saturday and unloaded more than 125,000 cheap passes to
``Bozo's Circus'' over the next five years.
   ``We'd call the response overwhelming,'' said WGN-TV spokesman
Tom Leach.
   The show first aired on Sept. 11, 1961, starring Bob Bell as the
red-haired, floppy-footed clown. When Bell retired in 1981, Joey
D'Auria took the billing in a show seen in more than 20 million
homes worldwide.
   The station, which is carried on many cable channels, stopped
distributing tickets in 1980 when the waiting list grew too long.
But 5{ hours after opening a Bozo hotline, it was swamped with
35,000 calls.
   For $3, each caller was allowed to get four tickets to a Bozo
taping. The show is taped every weekday from September through
April.
   Leach said a portion of the money will cover the cost of
registering and the rest will go to a West Side neighborhood center.
   Some callers mistakenly rang the phone at a real estate office
in suburban Chicago that has the name number but a different area
code.
   ``A lot of people were angry because we couldn't give them
tickets to Bozo,'' said Sue Wiskowski of Fair Realty Executives in
Aurora.

<TEXT>
   A Tehran daily Sunday criticized the
government's campaign to curb Iran's population explosion, an
effort that has underlined ideological disputes between President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and his radical rivals.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, quoted an editorial in the radical Jomhuri Islami
newspaper as saying the government had taken an ``unprincipled
approach'' in seeking to slow down population growth.
   Iran's population is swelling at a rate of about 3.9 percent a
year, one of the highest in the world.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, has
recognized that unchecked population growth threatens to outstrip
economic development and jeopardize the country's reconstruction
drive following the August 1988 cease-fire in the war against Iraq.
   The government put the population at 55 million recently. Before
the 1979 Islamic revolution, the figure was 37 million. It is
expected to top 100 million by the year 2010.
   The Jomhuri Islami editorial reflected opposition by
revolutionary hard-liners to the birth control campaign the
government began last year and the radicals' growing criticism of
Rafsanjani's policies.
   They argue that a large population will help Iran become the
leader of the Islamic world and ensure its power and prosperity.
   Blunting population growth is central to Rafsanjani's drive to
revitalize Iran's limping economy, expand industry and attract
foreign investment, which the anti-Western radicals charge
undermines the purity of the revolution.
   Jomhuri Islami noted: ``Those advocating population control warn
that the current rate of increase is too high ... and that the
country will not be able to provide food, education, medicines and
so on.''
   It said they argue that ``the present shortcomings in social
services are the natural outcome of rapid population growth ...
Even proper planning will not solve the problem and it is unlikely
to establish harmony between the existing facilities and the
population's needs.''
   On the other hand, the editorial said, ``opponents of population
control argue that ... the main problem is migration of villagers
to the cities and its side effects such as congestion in the
capital and major cities.''
   Tehran is bursting with a population that has doubled in recent
years to about 7 million.
   ``If Tehran is exploding due to the high rate of population
increase, there are many abandoned villages throughout the country
that are in miserable condition due to the lack of population,''
the editorial said.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has supported
the government's campaign by declaring that birth control does not
violate Islam.
   Islam itself has been seen as a factor for the alarming surge in
Iran's population since the revolution, whose leaders stressed
early marriage and encouraged large families.
   The marriage rate doubled from 4.5 per thousand in 1975 to 9.8
percent in 1983, according to available statistics.
   But the economy has not been able to keep up.
   There is a shortage of housing and schools, and unemployment has
risen. Tehran and other cities regularly suffer power cuts and
water shortages. Food accounts for an estimated one-third of all
imports because the agricultural sector has deteriorated alarmingly
since 1979.

   Two days of flooding across south Alabama left
at least 3,700 people homeless and killed nine others by Sunday,
and one town remained a muddy pond a day after its levee failed.
   ``I cannot begin to imagine everything that's been lost or
damaged,'' said U.S. Rep. Bill Dickinson after taking a helicopter
tour of Elba, where 1,500 people were evacuated after the Pea River
levee ruptured Saturday. Sixteen inches of rain had fallen in the
area in the two days before the earthen barrier gave way.
   About 45 miles downstream in Geneva, emergency workers shored up
another levee and continued evacuating residents, who started
leaving their homes Friday night.
   Margaret Mixon, emergency management director for Geneva County,
where about 450 people had fled, said officials believed the Geneva
levee would hold. But she added: ``I guess Elba was pretty
confident, too.''
   Rivers throughout southern Alabama swelled to as much as 21 feet
above flood levels Sunday as the water from the nearly non-stop
rains drained toward the Gulf of Mexico.
   Flooding also continued in sections of Louisiana, Mississippi,
Georgia, Tennessee, the Carolinas and Florida, as well as in
northeast Texas and New England.
   Alabama state troopers said six people drowned Friday night in
Covington County when a car fell into a rain-swollen creek where a
bridge had washed out, and two more people died the same way
Saturday night in neighboring Escambia County.
   A third man died in the county Saturday when he walked into a
flooded area to check on his parents. About 200 people were forced
to leave their homes in Escambia.
   A state police helicopter early Sunday rescued three people
trapped on Alabama 229 by roaring floodwaters from the Tallapoosa
River at Tallassee, about 25 miles northeast of Montgomery.
   Two rescue squad members were forced to abandon their boat while
trying to reach a driver whose pickup truck had stalled in the
water, said trooper Capt. Roy Smith. The chopper plucked the two
rescuers from the water and rescued the driver from the bed of his
truck more than three hours after the drama began.
   In the Montgomery area, about 80 miles northwest of Elba, some
500 people had to be evacuated as the muddy Alabama River rose to
19 feet above flood stage, with an even higher crest expected
Monday.
   Downstream to the west in Selma, about 200 people were evacuated
as the river rose toward its record 1961 flood level, said
emergency management director Warren Rhoades. Hundreds more could
be evacuated by Tuesday afternoon, when the river is expected to
crest 13 feet above flood level, Rhoades said.
   The Choctawhatchee River was 21 feet above flood stage in the
southeast Alabama town of Newton, about 30 miles east of Elba, and
sheriff's deputies said some 500 people had been evacuated since
Friday in Newton and surrounding Dale County. Evacuations in
Covington, Houston and Dallas counties brought the total number of
evacutations to about 3,700.
   Most people were staying with friends or in motels and very few
were in shelters, said Lawrence Bowden of the Alabama Emergency
Management Agency.
   State troopers reported dozens of road closings from Montgomery
south to the Florida line. About three dozen schools in four
counties said they would be closed Monday because of flooding.
   In Elba, the water receded slightly Sunday, gushing through a
100-foot hole on the levee's north side and pouring back into the
Pea River through a large crack that formed on the south side.
   But water still covered all but the tops of first-story windows
at the Coffee County Courthouse, and the city's three public
schools were still submerged. On Saturday, water had reached
second-story windows at the courthouse.
   Pumps would be used to help divert the current back into the
river bed, said William Fuller, chief of the Army Corps of
Engineers' emergency management division in Mobile.
   The water was up to the windows of Lela Wilson's one-story home,
which she moved into about a week ago.
   ``It hurts. It honestly hurts. It seems like everything you work
for you wind up losing,'' she said.
   Merchants in Brewton, west of Elba, began mopping up the 6 feet
of water that filled stores and the first floor of City Hall on
Saturday.
   Rep. Dickinson said southeast Alabama should ``certainly
qualify'' for federal disaster relief once Gov. Guy Hunt made a
request to federal amergency management officials.
   Elba Mayor Fred Moore said he would talk with Hunt after
officials assesed the damage, which he estimated would run into
millions of dollars in his town alone. Dickinson, who carried a
camera to photograph the damage, pledged his help at the federal
level.
   Col. Larry Bonine, the district engineer for the Corps of
Engineers in Mobile, said it was too early to tell whether the Elba
levee ruptured from the weight of the water, or whether the river
rose higher than the barrier and washed so much of it away that it
gave in, called overtopping.
   ``If the water overtopped it, there's not too many levees that
are built to handle that,'' he said.
   The earthen levee was constructed around Elba in the 1930s by
the Works Progress Administration after a record flood engulfed the
town of 4,400 in 1929.
   ``Levees are built based on historical flood data,'' said
Fuller. ``This storm exceeded the capacity that was built into the
design. This was built for the '29 flood.''
   Bonine was not sure when the levee last was inspected or if it
met the standards of a Corps-built structure. Fuller said
engineering teams would be brought in to inspect it.

   A storefront church collapsed Sunday
afternoon, trapping an 84-year-old Baptist minister and a female
worshiper under a pile of rubble, authorities said.
   The Rev. Romey L. Barber, his wife and two female parishoners
were leaving the Southern Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church
about 1:20 p.m. when the three-story building collapsed forward
onto them, according to Fire Department supervisor Stephen
Imszennik.
   The pastor and 53-year-old Jean Tucker were trapped for a half
hour, authorities said.
   Barber suffered multiple fractures and was in serious condition
at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, while Ms. Tucker was in
guarded condition at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania, spokeswomen said.
   The building appeared to have been ``structurally defective in
some way,'' Imszennik said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Guild Approves Agreement With Post-Dispatch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspaper Guild members Sunday overwhelmingly
approved a three-year contract with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and
called off a byline strike that began 12 days ago.
   Members of Guild Local 47, who've been working without a
contract since the old one expired Feb. 28, voted 365 to 69 for the
new pact, which is to be signed Monday.
   The 630-member local, the largest of the 11 unions at the
newspaper, represents reporters, some editors, photographers,
adverstising sales personnel, business workers and clerks.
   Reporters and photographers had withheld bylines and photo
credits since March 7 to protest an earlier, tougher contract offer
from the company.
   ``We're pleased that two-thirds of all unionized employees at
the Post-Dispatch have negotiated new contracts,'' newspaper
Publisher Nicholas G. Penniman IV said following Sunday's vote.
   The Guild was the sixth union to reach an agreement with the
Post-Dispatch. Five remain without a contract.
   The contract calls for a 4 percent pay raise each year, a
drug-testing policy, a clause prohibiting strikes or lockouts, and
a $600 contract-signing bonus for each member, payable by April 13.
   It also calls for 21 employees to be exempted from Guild
jurisdiction, instead of the 26 exemptions the company asked for
last week.
   The contract gives the paper the right to hire free-lancers to
cover some news events and to hire advertising salespeople to sell
ads on a commission-only basis for the paper's zoned editions.
   Herbert Goodrick, executive secretary of Guild Local 47, said
members who supported the contract ``recognized that it's not an
ideal contract, but we feel, given the alternative, that we can
live with the agreement.''

<HEAD>Some ANC Leaders Willing to Meet With Baker in South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
some African National Congress leaders said Sunday they will meet
Secretary of State James Baker III when he visits South Africa this
week, even though ANC leader Nelson Mandela criticized the trip.
   ``If the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see
him. But I will not meet him in South Africa,'' Mandela said
Saturday after returning from a five-nation tour. During his trip,
he called on foreign governments to cut all diplomatic ties with
the Pretoria government.
   Baker, who flies to neighboring Namibia on Monday, has invited
Mandela to a meeting there. Both men will be attending celebrations
of the South African colony's independence. Mandela has indicated
he will accept that invitation.
   The U.S. official then intends to fly to Cape Town on Thursday
to meet with President F.W. de Klerk and black leaders.
   ``We do not want any high-profile visits to South Africa because
these can result in a lot of confusion,'' Mandela said Saturday.
``They suggest that President de Klerk has done something positive,
something fundamental which requires the world to review sanctions
and other strategies, which we have invited in order to increase
pressure on South Africa.''
   De Klerk freed Mandela last month after he served 27 years in
prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government.
The president also legalized the ANC and other anti-apartheid
groups.
   Walter Sisulu, a member of the ANC's national executive and a
close friend of Mandela, said Sunday night he had received an
invitation to meet Baker in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, but would
be unable to accept it because he will be in London.
   However, he said ANC leaders Govan Mbeki and Raymond Mhlaba, who
were imprisoned with Mandela for plotting to overthrow the
government, will meet with the secretary of state.
   Asked to explain why ANC leaders would meet with Baker inside
the country after Mandela's comments, Sisulu said the issue had not
thoroughly been discussed earlier. In any case, he said, Mandela's
meetings are considered different from those of the other black
leaders.
   Tutu, the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town who won the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize, said he expected to meet Baker, probably in Cape
Town, although the meeting hadn't been confirmed.
   Regarding Mandela's statement, Tutu said: ``I appreciate the
necessity for political leaders to keep foreign governments under
pressure to take a firm stand against apartheid.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Efforts by moderate officials in Iran to push
for the release of hostages being held in the Mideast have been
derailed by hardliners opposed to Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, ABC News said Sunday night.
   In a report from Paris attributed to sources within the
Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Pierre Salinger reported that
leaders of groups holding hostages in Lebanon were summoned to
Tehran for meetings last week.
   ``There, the current plan to release the hostages was sabotaged
by Iranian hardliners opposed to Rafsanjani,'' Salinger reported.
   ``The hostage leaders returned to Lebanon three days ago and one
of the organizations, Islamic Jihad, issued a statement saying the
hostages wouldn't be released,'' he said. ``This position was
confirmed at a secret meeting in Lebanon 48 hours ago.''
   Spokeswoman Alixe Glen said there would be no White House
reaction to the report Sunday night.
   There had been several weeks of hints that the hostage issue
might be moving toward a solution until March 15 when Islamic
Jihad's threatened to kill three captive American educators unless
its demands were met regarding Jewish immigration from the Soviet
Union. The demands were not spelled out.
   The Tehran Times newspaper in Iran, which has close ties to
Rafsanjani, said in recent editorials that the hostages should be
freed on humanitarian grounds. Rafsanjani himself said he thought
the issue was moving toward a solution.
   Also, Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of
Hezbollah, said last month in a sermon that a humanitarian means of
freeing the hostages must be found.

   An alliance of conservative parties favoring
quick unification and backed by the Bonn government scored a
powerful victory in East Germany's first free elections Sunday,
according to official returns.
   However, the Alliance for Germany fell short of winning a
majority in the new 400-member Parliament.
   The elections marked the first free balloting in East Germany's
41-year history and capped the transition to democracy since the
fall revolution that ended one-party Communist rule.
   The results will help set the pace of unification, which only
became possible following the democratic changes across Eastern
Europe last year. Since then, many East Germans have clamored for
unification with prosperous West Germany as a way to a better life,
and the election results seemed to reflect that widespread
sentiment.
   The Alliance for Germany defeated the leftist-leaning Social
Democrats, who only a few weeks ago were considered the
front-runners. The alliance _ made up of the Christian Democrats,
the German Social Union and Democratic Awakening _ received strong
support from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing party.
   The final official returns, announced early Monday by election
commission chairwoman Petra Blaess, gave the alliance 48 percent of
the popular vote and 193 seats in the parliament. The Christian
Democrats, who led the alliance, alone gained 41 percent of the
vote for 164 seats.
   The Social Democrats received 22 percent and 87 seats. The
reformed Communists finished as the third-strongest individual
party with 16 percent and 65 seats.
   The conservative alliance could gain the extra margin for a
majority from the centrist Liberal alliance, which won 21 seats.
   A variety of other parties won the remaining spots. There were
24 parties or organizations competing for seats in the parliament,
which is to hold office for a four-year term.
   Commentators in East Germany and West Germany agreed Kohl played
a key role in helping the conservatives win by promising quick
replacement of East Germany's nearly worthless currency with the
West German mark and other financial benefits. Kohl also campaigned
extensively on behalf of the alliance.
   ``It was a victory for Kohl,'' West Germany's ARD television
network said.
   ``I just want to celebrate,'' Lothar de Maiziere, head of the
Christian Democrats, said at his party's headquarters. He was
viewed as the top contender to become East Germany's first
democratically elected premier.
   After the voting, he said a ``grand coalition'' with the Social
Democrats and other parties was possible to lead the country toward
unification with the greatest possible popular support.
   He said a broad coalition also was needed to muster the
two-thirds parliamentary majority necessary to change East
Germany's constitution and pave the way for quick reunification.
With such a majority, the East German parliament could simply
declare a merger with West Germany.
   De Maiziere also promised his party would strive for quick
economic, monetary and social union with West Germany.
   Kohl also voiced support for a broad coalition.
   ``The German citizens have decided against every form of
extremism,'' he said at a news conference in Bonn, the West German
capital. ``Most important, they want to follow a path, together
with West Germany, that will lead to unification.''
   Gregor Gysi, chairman of the reformed Communist party,
immediately offered support to the Social Democrats to prevent the
conservatives from gaining a two-thirds parliamentary majority.
   The current caretaker government is led by a Communist, Hans
Modrow. He and Gysi had proved surprisingly popular during the
campaign as they tried to shed their party's hard-line image.
   The election came five months to the day after hard-line
Communist leader Erich Honecker was toppled in the country's
peaceful revolution.
   A roaring crowd of 2,000 supporters jammed the conservative
alliance's headquarters late Sunday, waving party banners and West
German flags and drinking and dancing.
   ``As quickly as possible, unification!'' Dieter Schloder said.
``There is no question about it.''
   In Washington, the White House saluted the election. ``We have
long supported the aspirations of the people of East Germany to
decide their own future through a freely elected parliament and
government,'' said White House deputy press secretary Alixe Glen.
   Virtually all the parties favored unification with West Germany,
but at different paces.
   About 12.2 million people were eligible to vote, and some
districts reported 80 percent turnout by midday.
   People lined up at polling stations in cities as well as
makeshift voting booths in rural pubs and eateries. Some people
cast ballots from hospital beds.
   ``This is the greatest day of my life after being put down all
these years,'' whispered 66-year-old Annelisa Schoen, choking back
tears of joy as she voted in East Berlin.
   Some voters seemed a bit perplexed by the huge selection that
included such contenders as the Beer Drinker's Party.
   ``We have nothing we can draw from, no experience with the new
parties that we can use as a measure. There's no way we can know if
we are voting for the right person,'' said Christel Wilke, a poll
supervisor in Schoenwalde, 18 miles north of Berlin.
   The elections were the result of a peaceful revolution that was
touched off by an exodus of East Germans to the West.
   The nationwide movement ousted Honecker on Oct. 18, led to the
opening of the Berlin Wall in November and other once-sealed
borders, and ended the Communists' guaranteed monopoly on power.
   Honecker and many of his former associates now are accused of
abuse of power while in office and face trial, but even they were
allowed to vote, East Germany's official ADN news agency said.
   The new government will take part in unification talks with West
Germany and the four World War II allies _ Britain, France, the
Soviet Union, and the United States.
   A major issue is the military strength and alignment of a
unified Germany. The Western powers want what is now West Germany
to remain part of the NATO military alliance.
   The Soviets and East German Communists have called for a neutral
single state.
   Just when the new government will take office was unclear.
   The election campaign was bitter. The election originally was
scheduled for May, but it was moved up because of fears that
Modrow's interim leadership would collapse.
   There were claims that former secret police agents would use
false sets of identity cards to vote several times and boost the
Communists' chances. No irregularities were reported, however.
   The Communists tried hard to remove the taint of the Honecker
leadership, even changing their name to the Party of Democratic
Socialism. But the memories of years of repression were not easily
erased. Despite reforms, thousands of East Germans have continued
to leave their homeland for West Germany.
   As one way to stem the flood, Kohl and the Alliance for Germany
support making the powerful West German mark East Germany's
currency as well. De Maiziere reitered this desire Sunday night.
   ``The most important thing now is that people don't continue to
leave,'' he said.
   At his news conference in Bonn, Kohl agreed. ``My message at
this hour is: Stay home,'' he said. ``Work with us in your
villages, cities and communities, in your factories and in your
local administrations to build up this beautiful country.''

<HEAD>Japan Releases Its First Satellite Into Lunar Orbit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's first lunar probe launched a smaller
satellite into orbit around the moon early Monday, a government
space official said.
   The probe, called the Muses-A satellite, is circling the Earth
in a highly elliptical orbit that brought it within 10,213 miles of
the moon, said Yasunori Matogawa, spokesman for the
government-funded Institute of Space and Astronautical Science.
   Shortly before the 400-pound probe crossed the moon's path
during its swing-by, it released a second, smaller satellite that
was driven into lunar orbit by a ``kick motor,'' he said.
   Matogawa said the procedure went as planned. The smaller
satellite will move in an orbit ranging from 12,400 to 43,400 miles
from the moon.
   The mission will give Japan valuable experience in targeting
orbits and in the use of swing-bys for future spacecraft traveling
to distant planets. The Muses-A will pass the moon eight or nine
more times during the next year it is expected to remain in orbit.
   As the Muses-A crossed the moon's path, observation equipment
aboard the probe photographed the moon, but the images were not
very clear because of the satellite's relatively long distance from
the moon, Matogawa said. There is no observation equipment on the
smaller satellite.
   Both the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, which is
conducting the mission, and Japan's other space agency, the
National Space Development Agency, have plans for manned space
flights and interplanetary travel.
   The satellite, launched in January from Uchinoura Space Center
in southern Japan, is a symbolic step forward in Japan's budding
space program. Until now, only the United States and the Soviet
Union have sent missions to the moon.

   A gas pipeline exploded in western Tehran
on Sunday and started a huge fire, killing 13 people and injuring
scores more, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the pipeline blew up at
11:30 a.m. on a major thoroughfare, igniting a ``massive fire.'' It
took firefighters 90 minutes to douse the blaze, IRNA said.
   It said a fleet of ambulances took the casualties to hospitals
in the capital.
   At least 10 cars were destroyed and 15 buildings badly damaged
by the explosion, the agency reported. The explosion left a large
crater, it said.
   State-run Tehran radio quoted an unidentified official in charge
of emergency operations as saying engineers had been connecting a
safety valve to the pipeline at the time of the blast.
   ``According to the reports I have received, their carelessness
led to big escape of gas, and a spark set it ablaze,'' he said.

   East Germans voted in their first free
elections Sunday for a parliament that will steer the country
toward unification with West Germany. Early projections predicted a
landslide victory for a conservative alliance favoring quick
unification.
   West Germany's ZDF television network said the three-party
Alliance for Germany would get 53 percent of the vote. The
leftist-leaning Social Democrats, who campaigned for a more
cautious approach to unification, had 21 percent, it said. The
projections were based on exit polls.
   The Communists, who lost their 40-year monopoly on power in the
fall revolution, were projected to win 14 percent to 15 percent of
the vote. They had fared badly in pre-election polls, despite the
popularity of Communist Premier Hans Modrow and intensive efforts
to shed their hard-line image.
   Only a few weeks ago, the Social Democrats were considered the
strongest contenders. But the Alliance for Germany got massive
campaign help from West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

   Soviet military jets repeatedly streaked over the
capital of Lithuania during military maneuvers Sunday, one day
before a Moscow deadline demanding that the Baltic republic
renounce its declaration of independence.
   At the same time, however, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
struck a conciliatory tone, saying he still plans to talk with the
Lithuanians about returning to the Soviet fold. And he said there
have been no ultimatums.
   ``We will carry on conversations,'' Gorbachev told reporters
after voting in runoff elections.
   He continued to insist that Lithuania's March 11 declaration was
illegal and must be decided by the entire Soviet Union, not just
the republic. He said he would work for a new federation agreement
that would satisfy everyone.

   Disagreement inside the Bush administration
over the possibility that drastic changes in the Soviet Union will
be reversed is raising new questions about the size of the U.S.
defense budget.
   While CIA Director William Webster testified earlier this month
the political changes in the Soviet Bloc are irreversible, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney has maintained that Moscow could reassume its
former confrontational pose.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas S. Brady said Sunday that the
administration is still sticking with Cheney's proposed $3.2
billion cut in inflation-adjusted defense spending for fiscal 1991
beginning next Oct. 1.
   ``Three billion dollars is it; that's what Secretary Cheney
says; that's what it is,'' Brady said on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation'' program. ``That's our position at this point in time.''

   Talks between Greyhound and its striking
drivers abruptly broke down Sunday when company officials accused
union leaders of failing to negotiate and committing new violence.
   ``The union is stonewalling on the contract,'' Greyhound
executive vice president Anthony Lannie said in a statement. ``They
had nothing new for us today (Sunday) or yesterday while stepping
up the violence.''
   Lannie charged that violence continued Saturday even while the
two sides were meeting for the first time since 6,300 drivers and
an estimated 3,000 other Greyhound workers walked out March 2 over
wages, job security and grievance procedures.
   In Washington, Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Amalgamated
Council of Greyhound Local Unions, called Lannie's statement ``the
desperate words from a desperate man. We clearly condemn violence
and anything we can do to discourage our members we are doing so.''

   When General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith
retires in July, many industry analysts and company stockholders
expect his replacement to be more familiar with load-bearing shocks
than no-load funds.
   After a troubled decade of direction under a bean counter who
never worked in a prototype design studio, rumblings are increasing
both in and out of the auto giant for a car guy to take control.
   Smith, who will cap a 41-year career with GM, has been harshly
criticized for paying excessive heed to profits and too little
attention to products during his tenure as chairman.
   The image of an accountant who never really understood the car
business has dogged Smith for a long time.
   His most recent brush with bad publicity is the acclaimed
documentary film ``Roger &amp; Me,'' which chronicles the devastation
caused by GM plant closings and layoffs around Flint, Mich.,
birthplace of the corporation in 1908.
   As GM's chairman since New Year's Day 1981, Smith also has made
the tough decisions, like reducing hourly and salaried work forces
to maintain the company's profitability.
   When he officially steps down July 31, it will be 19 days after
his 65th birthday, the age of mandatory retirement from one of the
world's largest manufacturers.
   Well before then, the board of directors probably will designate
the next occupant of the 14th floor corner office of the General
Motors Building. That almost certainly will occur by the company's
annual meeting in mid-to-late May. It may be as soon as the next
regular board meeting April 2.
   The competition is focused on five men _ GM's president and four
executive vice presidents.
   The new chief executive will face many problems, including a
decaying share of the U.S. car and truck market, ferocious
competition from Japan and streamlining the corporation, which
employs about 750,000 people worldwide. Tens of thousands of other
people employed by other companies directly rely on GM for their
jobs as well.
   ``The investors that I speak to express the preference of an
operations guy rather than a finance guy,'' said auto analyst Scott
Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York.
   Smith began his GM career as a general accounting senior clerk
in Detroit and rose through the financial side. At Ford Motor Co.,
Chairman Harold Poling came up in finance but has considerable
product experience. Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca's
background is primarily product-oriented.
   ``You would think that with GM's slide in market share, you
would have to assume that it's product-related,'' said auto analyst
Joshua Harari of Standard &amp; Poors Corp. in New York. ``They've
modernized their plants, they've been successful in Europe and in
the truck market in the United States, so a product guy in the car
market might help.''
   GM's U.S. car and truck market share has dropped from 44.1
percent at the end of 1980, the day before Smith became chairman,
to 34.6 percent at the end of last year. The market share GM lost
went principally to the Japanese, on the strength of their U.S.
assembly plants, and to GM domestic rival Ford.
   Also during Smith's reign, GM embarked on an aggressive plant
modernization program, spending billions of dollars in new
equipment and methods of building distinctly different cars and
trucks.
   In the mid-1980s, and continuing to a lesser extent today, GM
was criticized for making cars for divisions that looked basically
the same. The hybrid names ``Oldsmobuick'' and ``Chevymobile''
still pop up from time to time.
   As GM's market share slid, so did profits. By the end of 1986,
the much-smaller Ford was out-earning GM. Ford's profit dominance
of GM continued for the next two years. GM regained the profit lead
last year.
   Smith began a cost-cutting plan in 1987 and has vowed to lop
more than $12 billion off the company's expenses.
   Profits have been propped up by the sales of GM's European-made
cars, Vauxhall and Opel, which enjoyed critical and commercial
success.
   ``Whatever management did successfully in Europe should be
duplicated'' in the United States, Harari said. ``I don't know if
it's so much pulling in the people or the techniques used in
Europe.''
   All of it has led to a lot of speculation about who's next.
   Large institutional stockholders, including the California
Public Employees Retirement System and the New York State and Local
Retirement System, expressed intense interest in the search process
but were rebuffed by GM in written pleas for briefings.
   GM says the search process and who's doing it is a private
function of the board. A team drawn from the 14 outside directors
is conducting the search.
   Most short lists of likely chairmen include GM President and
Chief Operating Officer Robert C. Stempel, Executive Vice President
F. Alan Smith of the Operating and Public Affairs Staffs Groups and
Executive Vice President John F. Smith Jr., who directs GM's
international operations.
   Also mentioned are Executive Vice President William E. Hoglund
of the automotive components group and Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer Robert T. O'Connell.
   ``From here, it still looks like Stempel to me,'' independent
auto analyst David Healy said. ``Then there are a bunch of guys
named Smith.''

   Greyhound buses have traversed America's landscape
since 1914, when a Swedish immigrant paid $600 for a fancy
Hupmobile to haul miners from Hibbing, Minn., to a saloon 10 miles
away in Alice.
   In the 76 years since, the company has changed owners several
times and evolved into the only nationwide bus company, blessed
with widespread recognition but troubled by high costs, low
profitability and labor unrest.
   Its current owner says the latest strike, the second walkout in
seven years, may delay but won't stop the company's rebound.
   ``We were rebuilding what had become a very weak resource,''
said Chairman Fred Currey. ``We were right on track and this is an
interruption of that rebuilding process, there's no doubt about
that.''
   The drivers union struck March 2 and Greyhound has been
operating at reduced levels since, using permanent replacements and
nonstrikers.
   Currey led the investor group that bought the bus company from
Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp. for $270 million in 1987. Four months
later, he bought Trailways Lines Inc. for $80 million and merged
the two under the Greyhound label.
   He has made the combined company a personal campaign, traveling
the country appealing directly to employees to help restore
Greyhound. In some meetings, he emphasizes teamwork by having
employees stand arm-in-arm.
   ``Middle income and lower income people in this country don't
have any other intercity transportation and I can take great
satisfaction in being part of an organization that fulfills that
need,'' Currey said in an interview.
   The strike has not altered Currey's personal approach. The first
day, he left his Dallas skyscraper office and walked to the bus
terminal nearby where a few drivers were picketing, some carrying
``Drop Dead Fred'' signs.
   ``They're good people,'' Currey said, ``although few of them
understood our contract proposal, and I must say I'm fearful they
do not understand what a permanent replacement means.''
   He has returned to the Dallas picket line at least once and last
Monday rushed to Jacksonville, Fla., where eight people were
injured in a sniper attack on a bus.
   Currey worked the terminal crowd, thanking people for traveling
Greyhound and hopping a bus himself for a ride to Orlando. ``I took
the trip because I thought it was important for Greyhound people
not to be intimidated,'' he said.
   What is now Greyhound Lines Inc. traces its ancestry to Carl
Eric Wickman, a Swedish immigrant who in 1913 bought the Hibbing,
Minn., Hupmobile dealership.
   After he couldn't sell a particularly well-appointed,
eight-passenger Hupmobile _ complete with copper-clad headlights
and brass radiator cap and crank handle _ he bought it himself for
$600 and began charging iron ore miners 15 cents for a one-way,
10-mile trip between the Hibbing firehouse and a saloon in Alice. A
round trip cost a quarter.
   Wickman sold and then repurchased the company, eventually moving
it to Duluth and later Chicago as a network of regional bus
companies came under the Greyhound umbrella.
   For a time in the '50 and '60s, the company's mascot was a
purebred greyhound, wearing a jeweled tiara and named ``Lady
Greyhound.''
   By the time it moved from Chicago to Phoenix in 1971, the
company had been condensed into one system as Greyhound Corp., a
manufacturing and financial conglomerate.
   Greyhound officials point to 1983 as the beginning of the bus
system's decline because the bus industry was deregulated and the
company went through a bitter, 47-day drivers' strike.
   Four years later, when Currey and others bought the company, he
won an agreement from the union for a 22 percent wage cut.
   ``These were the most unusual labor discussions I have
participated in because Currey, rather than coming to the table to
see how much he could squeeze from the employees, came to ask the
employees to work with him in rebuilding the company and to share
the benefits of the results,'' said Domenic Sirignano, union
president at that time.
   Now, the words have changed.
   ``The company's recent contract offers have demonstrated once
again that the reward Greyhound had in mind for its employees
amounted to millions for management and pennies for the people who
drive and maintain the buses and for the office workers who ensure
the efficient operation of the Greyhound system,'' said James La
Sala, international president of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Some critics claim the current strike is union-busting, a charge
Currey denies. His aides say Currey's respect for organized labor
was evident in the contract he signed with the union before buying
the company.
   ``He had the option of starting all over with a clean piece of
paper and a totally new work force,'' said company spokesman George
Gravley. ``If we were a union-busting company, what better chance
would we have?''
   Greyhound lost $20 million its first two years and made a
$730,000 profit on last year's $1 billion in revenue. Executives
say the company cannot afford more than the $63 million, three-year
pact it has offered.
   The union says its latest offer would cost less that
management's, but Greyhound values it at more than $200 million
over the life of the contract.
   Greyhound drivers were paid an average $24,743 last year.
   Currey says Greyhound will be back at full operation by the end
of the month, but the money spent to withstand the strike threatens
a $100 million capital improvement program.
   ``That is what is most disturbing to me,'' Currey said.

<HEAD>Exxon Stockholders Demand Meeting With Chairman</HEAD>

   A group of Exxon Corp. shareholders, claiming
the oil company's environmental problems have threatened the value
of their holdings, are demanding a meeting with the company's
chairman to explain Exxon's recent accidents and plans for avoiding
them in the future.
   In a letter dated Friday, managers of pension funds from
California, New York and Massachusetts, which own more than 14
million shares of Exxon stock, called on Exxon Chairman Lawrence G.
Rawl to discuss the string of accidents that have wreaked
environmental havoc from Alaska to New York.
   The group said it wants the nation's largest oil company to
disclose its plans for implementing environmental safety systems
and improving its environmental record.
   ``We want to emphasize the importance of holding this meeting as
soon as possible,'' said the letter signed by Gray Davis,
California state comptroller and manager of the nation's largest
public pension fund; Elizabeth Holtzman, New York City comptroller
and manager of its employee pension fund; and Paul Quirk, executive
director of Massachusetts' pension fund board.
   ``In addition to the environmental damage ... Exxon is creating
enormous potential financial liabilities that may harm the economic
performance of the corporation. These problems are beginning to
harm the financial health of Exxon,'' the letter said.
   Exxon officials could not be reached by telephone for comment
Sunday.
   The March 24 wreck of the Exxon Valdez in Alaska has so far cost
the company nearly $3 billion in clean-up expenses. Exxon set aside
$1.3 billion last year, but the letter noted, ``this estimate does
not include the potential effects of litigation.''
   More than 170 civil suits are pending against Exxon by fishermen
and others who claim they suffered losses because of the Alaska
spill. And last month's federal indictment of Exxon on charges
related to the spill could result in huge fines against the oil
company.
   Two spills in New York and New Jersey waterways since January
have further sullied the company's reputation and generated more
lawsuits, including suits by the states of New York and New Jersey.
   Shareholders also are concerned that Exxon's recent problems
have undermined the value of its stock, Ms. Holtzman said in a
telephone interview.
   ``When investment houses are not recommending the purchase of
Exxon stock, then we are concerned about the effect on our
portfolio,'' she said.
   Ms. Holtzman said the pension funds cannot get rid of their
shares because it would drive down the price of the stock.
Together, the three pension funds own slightly more than 1 percent
of Exxon's 1.3 billion outstanding shares.
   ``We can't sell our stock overnight; we're in for the long
haul,'' she said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Exxon stock
closed at $47.50, up 62{ cents. The stock has been largely flat in
the year since the spill; it traded in the $45 range at the time of
the accident.
   The latest posturing by Exxon shareholders comes about five
weeks before the company's April 25 annual meeting in Houston,
which could be a repeat of 1989's spirited gathering.
   Unlike last year, however, shareholders will get the opportunity
to vote on environmental resolutions that could affect the company.
Last year's meeting was held soon after the Alaska spill and
shareholders did not have time to submit such resolutions.
   Six shareholder proposals on environmental issues have been
cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission for inclusion in
Exxon's proxy statement this year.
   The company opposes all six proposals, which among other things
call for Exxon to ``take leadership in dealing with (the) damage''
caused by its Alaska spill.
   Another resolution calls for an environmental report card based
on the Valdez Principles, a set of guidelines formulated by
environmentalists calling for conservation, restoration of damaged
environments, reduction of wastes and other moves to protect the
environment.
   The resolutions are not expected to pass since Exxon stock is so
widely held and no single shareholder _ individual or group _ owns
as much as 2 percent of the company's outstanding shares. But the
stockholders who initiated the proposals hope they will increase
pressure on Exxon to become more environmentally sensitive.

<HEAD>Despite OPEC Agreement, Oil Prices Likely to Slide</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: REWRITES throughout to UPDATE with analyst comments.</NOTE>

   Oil prices will likely slide further in
the weeks ahead despite OPEC's fresh call for restraints on crude
production, analysts said Sunday.
   ``Prices are going to come under a lot of pressure,'' predicted
Peter Gignoux, director of the international energy department of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in London.
   Peter Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Paris, predicted a gradual slowdown
in prices before a key OPEC pricing meeting in late May.
   However, the softening of oil prices will likely have little
impact on gasoline prices at the pump.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, hoping to keep the target price of oil at $18 a barrel,
wound up a special committee meeting late Saturday by urging
caution during the second quarter.
   Demand for crude normally slumps in the April-June period when
spring arrives in the United States and other consuming nations. As
a result, Bogin said, prices could drop as much as $1.70 a barrel
in the weeks ahead.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel
unexpectedly soared to $20.56 a barrel in early January but has
since fallen, reaching $17.91 last week. West Texas Intermediate,
the key American grade, has been trading between $20 and $21 a
barrel.
   Every dollar decline _ or rise _ in the price of a barrel of oil
amounts to about a 5 cent change in gasoline prices.
   But even if gasoline prices slipped in the second quarter, they
likely would firm in the summer months when demand increases again.
Gasoline accounts for the bulk of petroleum used in the United
States.
   OPEC is estimated to be producing as much as 24 million barrels
of oil a day, exceeding its output cap of about 22 million barrels
for the January-June period.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said internal estimates forecast
demand of 20.8 million barrels a day in the second quarter.
   To try to halt price erosion, the ministers renewed their
determination to abide by their individual supply limits. To do so,
some would have to turn off the taps.
   ``We expect that we will withdraw some quantities from the
market during the (coming) months,'' said Algerian Oil Minister
Sadek Boussena.
   But analysts were skeptical that chronic cheaters Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates would limit production to meet their quotas.
   ``We don't think Kuwait will cut back unless there is an intense
weakening in prices,'' said Bogin.
   Kuwait, analysts estimate, is producing at least 1.7 million
barrels a day, compared with a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah has said his country
does not feel bound by its cap when prices remain at $18.
   Gignoux, the Shearson analyst, said the United Arab Emirates was
unlikely to reduce production.
   The emirates, which have not accepted its quota of about a
million barrels a day, has been pumping double that, analysts say.
   Much of the ministers' closed-door talks were in preparation for
the May meeting when they will set pricing and output guidelines
for the last half of the year.
   The ministers opened the monitoring committee meeting Friday
evening and then met informally on Saturday. Only eight nations
technically belong to the panel, but all OPEC members were
represented.
   OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.
