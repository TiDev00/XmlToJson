   Greta Garbo, who spent most of her life avoiding
publicity, was not much more forthcoming in her will filed
Wednesday, leaving her entire estate to her niece and her four
children.
   The documents list her assets only as ``more than $500,000.''
   All of it _ including rights to the Garbo name and image and
residuals from her works _ was bequeathed to Gray Reisfield of
Milltown, N.J., and her four children.
   Mrs. Reisfield _ whom Garbo called ``my dearest living
relative'' _ was also named sole executor. She is reportedly in her
60s.
   The screen legend died April 15 at 84 of natural causes,
according to the death certificate filed in Manhattan Surrogate's
Court with the will, which was signed March 2, 1984.
   The only other person mentioned in the will was Ake Fredriksson
of Oxelosund, Sweden, described as a ``possible non-marital child''
of Garbo's late brother, Sven Alfred Gustafson.
   Fredriksson and ``all others are disinherited who are or claim
to be related to me in any way.''

   A paralyzed, pain-stricken woman who blinked
once to tell a judge she wanted to be allowed to die can be taken
off a respirator that is keeping her alive, the judge ruled
Thursday.
   Common Pleas Court Judge Nicholas M. D'Alessandro gave Neumann
Medical Center officials one week to remove 51-year-old Thelma
Stussy from the machine.
   The ruling came a day after a hospital bedside hearing at which
Ms. Stussy signaled her wishes.
   Ms. Stussy suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, a
fatal, incurable nerve degeneration also known as Lou Gehrig's
disease.
   She is paralyzed from the neck down and is in constant pain. She
cannot speak; she blinks to answer ``yes'' and moves her head
slightly from side to side to answer ``no.''
   She and her family, including a teen-age daughter and a teen-age
son, had asked to have the respirator removed, but Neumann Medical
Center officials, fearful of a lawsuit of criminal charges, asked
the judge to decide.
   The judge said that before disconnecting the mechanical
ventilator, the hospital must advise Ms. Stussy it is doing so.
   Ms. Stussy will die in a few hours or a day after disconnection,
said her physician, Dr. Leonard M. Popowich.
   ``All I want is for you to see her and see what she's going
through,'' one of her daughters, 18-year-old Joy Stussy, tld the
judge at Wednesday's hearing.
   ``She could continue to suffer for another week and another week
and another week. Just do something for her, please,'' the daughter
said.
   ``It's just difficult, difficult,'' D'Alessandro told the
Philadelphia Daily News after leaving the hospital room. ``Everyone
was emotional. We were all emotional.''
   Sandra Green, a risk-management official at the hospital, said
she cried during the hearing: ``I try to be very objective. It just
got to me.''
   Other hospital officials said they would not comment on the
case, citing patient confidentiality.
   Ms. Stussy can move her lips slightly to form words, but only
Joy understands her. She managed to slowly dictate a letter to Joy,
dated Feb. 6 , to Popowich.
   ``I haven't changed my mind about having the respirator
removed,'' she wrote. ``However, if the decision is to have the
machine remain, I want to be sedated not just for my fear of the
machine but my hands and legs from not moving are in constant and
severe pain. Please do what you can.''
   ALS is a degenerative disease that destroys the nervous system
and paralyzes its victims. Ms. Stussy, of Philadelphia, has
suffered from the disease for two years and was admitted to the
hospital in late December.
   Popowich testified Wednesday that he had no objection to taking
her off the respirator, but did not want to do it personally. No
other doctor could be found to do it, he said.
   The hospital sued for the right to comply with her wishes. Green
said court approval would make it possible to find a physician or
nurse who could disconnect the machine.

<HEAD>Unocal Announces Alternative Smog-Control Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unocal Corp., joining a growing contingent of
oil companies with clean air ideas, announced Thursday it would
offer to buy 7,000 older gas-eating cars in an effort to reduce
smog in the Los Angeles basin.
   Unocal has allocated $5 million to purchase the cars, which must
be at least 20 years old, and scrap them, said Richard J.
Stegemeier, Unocal's chairman and chief executive. The plan would
eliminate an estimated 6 million pounds of pollutant gases, he said.
   Owners would be offered $700 apiece for the locally registered
junkers, Stegemeier said.
   ``We want to take the heaviest polluters off the road and hand
them over to a scrap yard, which will shred and recycle the
metal,'' Stegemeier said.
   Unocal executives noted that pre-1971 vehicles pollute from 15
to 30 times more than 1990 models, with about 410,000 such jalopies
and bombs registered in the region. The program is scheduled to
begin June 1.
   Another voluntary program, to take effect in July, offers free
smog checks and emission control tune-ups for pre-1975 cars at
participating Unocal 76 service stations.
   Such tune-ups could remove 17 million pounds of carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides and reactive organic gases from the Los Angeles
basin, which has the worst air quality problem in the nation, the
Los Angeles-based oil company said.
   A spokesman for Southern California's powerful air quality
agency voiced support for Unocal's program, which was seen by one
industry analyst as a growing trend of ``greening'' among oil
companies.
   Unocal's approach also reflects a different philosophical
approach to eliminating air pollution in the region.
   ``We want to demonstrate ways of reducing smog that are
efficient and cost-effective,'' Stegemeier said.
   A similar proposal was suggested last year to regional smog
control officials by the Claremont Institute, a conservative
non-profit think tank.
   The institute had suggested paying about $1,500 apiece to remove
850,000 pre-1980 vehicles from the region, at a cost of $1.3
billion, said Lucas Morel, a research associate at the institute.
   It moves away from the command and control of a centralized
bureaucracy by allowing industries in the marketplace to choose
their own methods to achieve certain reductions of emissions, Morel
said.
   While unusual in its approach, however, Unocal's announcement
was hardly unique.
   ``They're all becoming environmentally pro-active,'' said
Kenneth B. Funsten, an oil industry analyst with Wedbush Morgan
Securities in Los Angeles.
   Funsten attributed the trend largely to Exxon's handling of the
Alaskan oil spill, which has hardened political opposition to oil
industry operations.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. last September introduced a reformulated
low-emission gasoline to replace leaded regular in its pumps, and
the Shell Oil Co. followed suit with a similar reformulation for
premium gas.

<TEXT>
   India and Pakistan agreed Wednesday to try
to reduce military tensions in Kashmir, a territory over which they
have fought two wars.
   However, a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two
countries failed to make progress on the fundamental stalemate over
Kashmir.
   India accuses Pakistan of supporting terrorism by giving aid to
Moslem secessionists; Pakistan says India is violating U.N.
Security Council resolutions that call for the people of Kashmir to
determine their own future.
   The ministers, Inder K. Gujral of India and Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan
of Pakistan, said the military chiefs of the two countries would
communicate regarding ways to head off confrontations in the tense
region.
   The two also said in a joint statement that both sides would
exercise restraint, and that diplomatic channels of communication
would be kept open.
   Both officials were in New York for a United Nations meeting on
international economic cooperation.
   Yaqub-Khan told reporters afterward that the talks were ``free
and frank'' but indicated there was no progress toward compromise
on Kashmir's future.
   A 1948 Security Council resolution calls for a plebiscite in
Kashmir. India and Pakistan both agreed to the resolution, but
India holds that it was nullified when political leaders in Kashmir
opted for union with India.
   More than 300 people have died in the Kashmir valley in
sectarian violence or in clashes with authorities since Jan. 20,
when Indian security forces began a crackdown on escalating
protests, bombings and attacks on state officials.
   Initially the secessionists wanted union with Moslem Pakistan,
but in recent weeks they have declared they want an independent,
non-aligned nation in Kashmir.
   India and Pakistan fought wars over the territory in 1948 and
1965. India now controls the southern two-thirds of Jammu-Kashmir,
and Pakistan the northern third.

   The U.S. Air Force has restricted
travel to Manila by military personnel and their families because
of threats by Communist rebels, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   Lt. Kim Uria, an Air Force spokeswoman at Clark Air Base, said
the restrictions, imposed at the beginning of the month, will
continue indefinitely.
   Last month, the Navy put similar restrictions on personnel at
the Subic Bay base.
   The rules restrict unofficial trips to Manila, 50 miles to the
south, and advise against use of public transportation between the
Manila airport and the air base.
   Last September, Communist guerrillas killed two civilian
employees of Camp O'Donnell, a U.S. Air Force post near Clark. In
October 1987, Communist rebels gunned down three Americans in
simultaneous attacks just outside the air base.

<HEAD>Heart Medicine Appears to Slow Lung Damage in Cystic Fibrosis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors today reported development of the first
treatment to reduce the lung-clogging secretions that make cystic
fibrosis a major killer.
   Preliminary tests on adults found that a commonly used blood
pressure medicine, given in aerosol form, significantly slowed lung
damage in victims, according to the report in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   ``If it proves safe and effective in a large number of patients,
our real fantasy is that we could give it to children at an early
age when their lungs are not damaged, and it could be used as a
preventative therapy for a long time,'' said Dr. Michael R.
Knowles, who developed the treatment.
   Cystic fibrosis results from a genetic defect. Victims' lungs
produce thick mucous that interferes with breathing and harbors
bacteria. Chronic infections damage the lungs and eventually cause
death.
   Only about half of all victims live to their mid-20s. The new
approach, if it works as doctors hope, ``could increase life
exponentially,'' said Dr. Robert Beall, research director of the
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.
   ``We feel that if we can change the environment of the lung so
that we don't give bacteria a good place to live, we might add
decades to these kids' lives,'' he said.
   The treatment is an inhaled form of a medicine called amiloride.
The drug, known as a diuretic, is ordinarily given as pills to
treat high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and fluid
retention associated with kidney disease.
   Beall said another study is planned to test the therapy on
children. Knowles cautioned that until the results are in, doctors
should not routinely use the drug on youngsters, because it might
have dangerous side effects.
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal, inherited genetic
defect among whites in the United States. One of every 2,500 people
has the disease.
   Because of the abnormality, cells that line the air tubes in the
lungs absorb too much salt and water. While antibiotics are
commonly used to reduce infections, the new treatment is the first
to tackle the underlying mixup in the body's chemistry.
   Amiloride works by reducing the lung cells' absorption of salt
and water. This makes their mucous thinner, less likely to promote
bacterial growth and easier for victims to cough up.
   Knowles' study was conducted on 14 people at the University of
North Carolina.
   For two consecutive six-month periods, they used aerosol
amiloride or a sham treatment. While their conditions did not
improve, the rate of lung damage appeared to be slowed while taking
amiloride. The doctors calculated that it reduced the loss of lung
capacity by 60 percent when compared to the dummy spray.
   Amiloride in pill form is ineffective against cystic fibrosis.
Knowles and two other researchers hold the patent on the aerosol
technique, and the pharmaceutical firm Glaxo has bought the rights
to produce the inhaled form.
   More testing will be necessary before permission is sought from
the Food and Drug Administration to make the treatment routinely
available.

   Brace yourselves, viewers: You loved ``America's
Funniest Home Videos.'' Are you ready for ``Cincinnati's Funniest
Home Videos?'' Washington's wackiest? Denver's drollest?
   You'd better be. The phenomenal success of ABC's half-hour home
video show has prompted enthusiastic knockoffs by local stations
girding for May's important ratings sweeps.
   ``We have more than a dozen affiliates around the country
running their own local contests for viewers,'' said Judy Raskin, a
spokeswoman for ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   She said she didn't know which affiliates were participating,
but said they are required to relay entries to the network show.
   One affiliate involved is WKRC in Cincinnati, which airs a
2{-minute home video segment, usually as a ``kicker'' to close its
Sunday late news show.
   ``We're definitely enlisting and actively searching out home
videos,'' said Steve Doerr, assistant news director.
   People aren't sending in as many tapes as expected, Doerr said,
but he figures that's because WKRC is competing with the network
show, which offers a weekly, $10,000 prize for the best video _ and
$100,000 for the season's best.
   WKRC is working out a deal with a local company to provide
prizes for Cincinnati's funniest home videos.
   There's quite a potential audience out there. About 2.3 million
video cameras were sold last year, and by next year one household
in 10 will have one, according to industry estimates.
   Our fascination with home video is in its innocence and openness
as a highly personal form of expression, says critic Neal Gabler,
who helped judge Video Review magazine's amateur video contest.
   ``It's a naive kind of folk art very much like folk art of the
19th century,'' Gabler said after showing the winners to reporters.
The grand prize winner was a droll travelogue on the Honolulu-Long
Beach, Calif., tunnel.
   No kidding.
   ``We're so accustomed to things being packaged and manufactured,
I think `America's Funniest Home Videos' is a kind of unconscious
rebellion against that,'' he said.
   That fascination has spurred competition for videos in tight
television markets like Denver, where ABC affiliate KUSA is airing
a one-hour home video special on May 23.
   ``It's something that people want to see,'' said Mike Watson,
co-producer. ``It could be you, it could be your neighbor. It's
photojournalism in its truest sense.''
   KUSA got a video store to offer a $5,000 home video setup as
grand prize, then solicited videos with the promise to relay them
to the network show. Eventually, KUSA got more than 150 tapes.
   ``Some people would send the raw tape with no note telling
what's funny,'' Watson said in a pained voice. ``I hope they really
pay those people who screen the tapes on `America's Funniest Home
Videos.'''
   Watson isn't sure how long it will last. ``I think it's a
passing thing, but I have a fun time doing it and the audience
should have a fun time,'' he said.
   KCNC, a Denver rival owned and operated by NBC, started
soliciting videos a month ago, and tries to broadcast at least one
each Tuesday on its early evening news and features show, said Tom
Lea, news operations manager.
   ``We're getting a good number of contributions, but many of them
just aren't that funny,'' Lea said. ``I think it's definitely the
kind of thing where there is definitely a market, but I don't know
how long it's going to last.''
   In Washington, NBC affiliate WRC is offering ``Washington's
Wackiest Home Videos,'' a three-day featurette for its 6 p.m.
newscasts during the May sweeps. May is one of four months in which
estimates of viewer size are used to determine a station's
advertising rates.
   Crosstown, ABC affiliate WJLA airs the first of four home video
segments Sunday on its late newscast. Viewers will vote for a
winner to be announced on the Monday night newscast, said Joyce
Kravitz, a spokeswoman.
   WJLA viewers don't even need their own equipment. ``We have a
camera from `America's Funniest Home Videos,' and we're making it
available to viewers who want to participate,'' she said.
   There's a big advantage to the funny video format that already
has proved a bonanza for the network: It costs practically nothing
to produce.
   ``It's almost a natural resource for television,'' said Doerr.
   One final question: Are Cincinnati's funniest home videos really
that funny?
   ``Humor, like video, is in the eye of the beholder,'' Doerr
said. ``Early returns indicate people like it.''

<HEAD>Three Major African Nations Committed to One-Party Rule</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tide of democracy sweeping Eastern
Europe is being felt in black Africa, but one-party rule still
predominates and three of the major states have publicly committed
themselves to it.
   Tanzania has had only one party for 26 years and said this month
the policy will not change. Kenya did the same and Zimbabwe's
leader, Robert Mugabe, declared his intention to install one-party
rule.
   ``If we have many political parties, we will have chaos as
different tribes rush to form theirs,'' President Daniel arap Moi
of Kenya told trainee teachers at Laikipia in central Kenya.
``Tribal inclinations and consciousness is still paramount in the
minds of many Kenyans.''
   ``For now, I say no to the multiparty system, at least until we
are cohesive enough as a nation,'' he said.
   Kenya has 40 tribes in a population of 22 million. Ethnic
feuding is common in Parliament, at public rallies and in the press.
   Moi, a 66-year-old a former teacher from the minority Kalenjin
tribe, inherited the one-party system in 1978 from the late
President Jomo Kenyatta, the nation's founder. Kenyatta had banned
opposition parties nine years earlier.
   Kenyatta created a de facto one-party state by locking up his
political opponents. Moi made it constitutional in 1982.
   The president's statement was his first on the subject since
some other African states began considering more liberalized
political systems this year.
   He spoke after weeks of debate in Nairobi newspapers about
whether Kenya should restore the style of democracy bequeathed to
Kenyatta when he led the former British colony to independence in
1963.
   Writers supporting the status quo argued that Kenya had
prospered under the current system, without tribal strife. They
said a return to the old order might cause ethnic violence and
drive away tourists and investors.
   Those who wanted change said Kenyans were politically mature
enough for competition, that recent reforms in eastern Europe
should be used as an example and that a parliamentary opposition
would help check official corruption, mismanagement and nepotism.
   Neighboring Tanzania, a nation of 100 tribes, also was a British
colony until independence in 1961 under Julius Nyerere.
   Unlike its wealthy capitalist cousin, Tanzania followed
socialism based on Eastern European models. Both Nyerere and Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, who succeeded him as president in 1985, have
admitted the policies were flawed.
   Mwinyi, 65, has adopted radical economic reforms prescribed by
Western lenders, but has rejected suggestions that they be
accompanied by political change.
   ``While a multiparty system would be suitable for Europeans, it
might not be the same with Tanzania,'' Mwinyi told reporters in Dar
es Salaam.
   ``What Africans want is a fair return for their sweat through a
new international economic order. ... This cannot be solved by the
creation of 100 parties, which can bring chaos instead of
progress.''
   He said Tanzanians had voted consistently for a single party as
a way to guarantee national unity. He did not mention a statement
Nyerere made in February that multiparty democracy now may be
possible.
   Nyerere, still chairman of the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi Party,
remains a powerful political figure five years after he resigned as
president.
   Only a few of the 50 member nations of the Organization of
African Unity have Western-style democracies.
   Zimbabwe is one, but President Robert Mugabe declared after an
overwhelming victory in recent national elections that he will
transform the former British colony of Rhodesia into a one-party
state.
   Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe to independence 10 years ago, said the
elections were a mandate from the 4.8 million registered voters to
get rid of the opposition.
   His opponents accused Mugabe, 66, of seeking a dictatorship.
They noted that only 54 percent of the electorate voted and
opposition parties got 20 percent of the votes, although they won
only three of the 150 Parliament seats.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire said this week he would lift
a 20-year-old ban on opposition parties and his Popular Movement
for the Revolution, since 1970 the only official party, no longer
would have special status.
   He said the constitution of the former Belgian colony would be
rewritten and an interim government would be installed by April 24,
1991, to prepare for elections.
   Benin, a former French colony, is pledged to eliminate one-party
rule, Gabon is debating the question and there is pressure in the
Ivory Coast for a freer political order.
   Cameroon and Niger, scenes of recent political upheavals, have
rejected multiparty politics.
   Significant signals of change are coming from unlikely quarters.
   Ethiopia and Mozambique have abandoned their hardline Marxist
ideologies, and the Marxist leaders of Angola have committed
themselves to peace talks with U.S.-backed guerrillas that, if
fruitful, could lead to open elections.

   Horse breeder Leslie Combs II bequeathed
most of his millions to a cancer foundation. But there were strings
attached: The foundation must fire its director.
   And there are conflicting ideas about why he did it.
   Combs, founderof Spendthrift Farm, died of cancer April 7 at age
88. He stipulated in his will that the Emphraim McDowell Cancer
Foundation be given an endowment worth $26 million over the next 25
years, on condition that it replace Linda Mauk as director.
   In the will, which distributed assets of $6.3 million and an
undisclosed amount from two trusts, Combs said, ``I am not pleased
with the conduct of Linda Mauk ... ''
   The will stipulated that Centre College in Danville, which Combs
attended for two years, receive most of the money if Mauk remained
in her post.
   Juliette Combs Trapp, Combs' daughter, said in a statement
Tuesday her father made the demand because Mauk allegedly told him
last July that his wife's name might be removed from a cancer
center if he changed his will.
   ``This was understandably traumatic to him and was enough to
cause him to include the reference to ... Mauk in his will,'' Trapp
said.
   But Mauk, 37, denied Wednesday that she told Combs his late
wife's name, Dorothy Enslow Combs, would be taken off one of
buildings in the Lucille Parker Markey Cancer Center at the
University of Kentucky.
   ``There was no threat,'' said Mauk, who has been the
foundation's executive director 10 years. ``That's not a building
for us to take a name off of. It belongs to the University of
Kentucky. We turned the building over to the university.''
   Marylou Whitney, a longtime McDowell supporter, threatened last
week to resign as foundation co-chairman if Mauk is dismissed. Mauk
also has received support in an editorial and several letters in
the Lexington Herald-Leader.
   ``It's nice to know that you have supporters out there,'' said
Mauk, adding that she has received flowers and numerous phone calls
from people wanting her to remain in the post.
   The foundation was created to generate donations for the Lucille
Parker Markey Cancer Center. It has raised $27 million, all from
private sources. Combs had been involved in the fund-raising.
   Dr. Ben F. Roach, the foundation's chairman, has told the
newspaper he would let Trapp's statement ``ride on its own merits.''
   ``I don't have any comment,'' Roach told The Associated Press.
``I've probably said too much already.''
   Brownell Combs II, Combs' son, declined to comment on the
controversy after meeting with Roach on Wednesday.
   ``I'll let my sister's statement suffice,'' he said.
   Roach told the newspaper the foundation's 15 trustees would meet
``very shortly'' and might issue a statement. One trustee said the
meeting could be as early as Friday, but Roach would not confirm
that day.
   ``Nobody enjoyed living more than Leslie Combs,'' Mauk said. ``I
hope people look at this and realize how vulnerable people are when
facing death.
   ``There are probably a thousand pieces to the pie. Everything he
did (in the will) was impacted by those thousand pieces.''
   Mauk confirmed that she wrote a letter to Combs in March
``because I didn't want him to think I was mad at him and that I
didn't want him to be mad at me or Dr. Roach.''
   Trapp's statement said Mauk's letter tried to mollify the
remarks about changing the name of the building.
   ``Unfortunately, Dad did what he did, and he's no longer here,
so there's no way it can be changed,'' Trapp said.
   Lexington lawyer Charles Hembree, who drafted the will, has
refused to comment on the matter. He is also one of three trustees
of Combs' trust.
   Mauk is unsure what she will do.
   ``I'm stewing on all the options,'' she said.

<HEAD>Hollywood Worried About High Court Ruling on `Rear Window' Profits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

   The film industry could be faced with an
avalanche of lawsuits and the public could see fewer movie classics
because of the U.S. Supreme Court's copyright ruling involving the
thriller ``Rear Window.''
   Entertainment industry attorneys said Tuesday's ruling means
film studios re-releasing old movies will have to scour their books
to make sure all copyrights are covered.
   The court said actor Jimmy Stewart and other owners of ``Rear
Window'' must share earnings from movie's 1983 re-release with the
current owner of the renewed copyright to the story on which the
film was based. The author of the story is no longer alive.
   The high court relied heavily on a 1909 law that permits a
copyright to be renewed for 28 years after the initial 28-year
copyright period ends. The idea is to give authors, other artists
and their heirs a second chance to reap rewards from successful
works.
   ``It's going to be potentially an additional cost for the
producers and the distributors,'' said Arnold Lutzker, a Washington
attorney whose clients include the Directors Guild of America.
``You could find third parties coming out of the woodwork.''
   The ruling could cost producers millions of dollars in profits
and reduce the financial incentive for making hundreds of film
classics available in the United States, said an attorney for MCA
Inc.
   ``It's not all good for the authors,'' said Sheldon Mittleman,
MCA's house counsel. Mittleman said motion picture companies may be
reluctant to develop movies based on material whose copyrights will
soon be up for renewal.
   ``For the studios and the public, this could be a very serious
situation,'' Mittleman said. ``It could mean that the American
public will be deprived of the chance to see classic movies.''
   The decision is a victory for Sheldon Abend, a literary agent
who paid $650 to Chase Manhattan Bank in 1971 for the copyright to
the dime-magazine detective story on which ``Rear Window'' was
based. The bank administered the author's estate.
   Abend said the movie's 1983 re-release infringed on the renewed
copyright he bought and that the owners interfered with his plans
to contract with Home Box Office cable TV for a new play and TV
version of the story.
   He said he wants a portion of the more than $12 million the film
has earned since 1983 for Stewart, Hitchcock's heirs and MCA
Artists Ltd.
   The ruling also could affect the recording industry, live
theater and computer software, said Stephen Kroft, a lawyer who
filed a brief on behalf of several major film companies opposing
Abend's claim.
   ``It's a noose around the neck for owners of these works,''
Kroft said. ``It's very unfortunate. It's got potentially very
broad ramifications.
   ``And a work can incorporate or be based on all kinds of
different copyrighted work _ songs, especially. Think about a film
like `American Graffiti' and all the songs in it,'' Kroft said.
   Stewart was traveling but spokesman John Strauss said the actor
would not discuss legal matters.
   ``Rear Window,'' which starred Stewart and Grace Kelly, is based
on ``It Had to be Murder,'' a short story by Cornell Woolrich first
published in 1942 in Dime Detective Magazine.

<HEAD>Some in Congress Urge Sanctions Against Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some members of Congress are expressing
growing discontent over President Bush's go-slow reaction to the
Soviet Union's crackdown on Lithuania.
   ``I sense that more in Congress are beginning to share our
concern about the administration's policy of inaction,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., whose state includes a large number of
Lithuanian-Americans.
   If the Soviets continue their economic blockade against the
breakaway Baltic republic, Simon said, ``My guess is that Congress
will lead if the president does not.''
   Lithuanians heaped criticism on Bush after the president
postponed any economic sanctions against Moscow for fear of boxing
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev into a corner, and thus slowing
the pace of Soviet reform.
   Bush defended his decision on Wednesday.
   ``The policies, decisions I've taken have had strong support
from the American people, and that's who I work for,'' he said.
   Some members of Congress, like House Speaker Thomas J. Foley,
D-Wash., and Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, have backed Bush's decision.
   Others have argued for an American response.
   ``My constituents are right,'' said Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md., disagreeing with Bush. ``The U.S. government has an
obligation to support the Lithuanian people.
   ``I will support sanctions against the Soviets until they
respect Lithuania's right to self-determination,'' she said.
   While Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has not
criticized Bush, he reiterated his call Wednesday for the
administration to do something ``to express disapproval and to
deter further actions against Lithuania.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., was harsher. He blasted Bush for
wanting to have a ``photo op with Gorbachev'' at Kennebunkport,
Maine, during the planned May summit more than wanting to do what
is right on Lithuania. Kennebunkport is Bush's summer home.
   DeConcini said the arms control summit ought to be scrapped
until the Soviet Union makes a radical change of course on
Lithuania, which has declared its independence.
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, also said Bush should postpone the summit to
``send a message around the world.''
   Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire joined the
criticism, saying, ``The Bush administration dishonored the
principled conduct of previous administrations toward Lithuania.
   ``The time for silence has passed ... We have been patient and
nothing good has happened,'' he said. ``It's time for sanctions,
Mr. President.''
   Meantime, Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., was among members of
Congress who talked with Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis
by telephone Wednesday.
   Landsbergis told Durbin, who is of Lithuanian heritage, that
Moscow continues to stop shipments of fuel and other necessities
and has blocked the main port.
   ``The Soviets are strangling (our) nation like a boa
constrictor,'' Landsbergis said.
   Durbin said the United States has ``squandered its reputation as
a leader in the area of human rights'' because of the way it
handled Lithuania.
   ``The president gave a green light for the Kremlin to continue
to apply pressure and intimidation to Lithuania,'' Durbin said. ``I
certainly don't believe we can stand by in good conscience while
the people of Lithuania suffer.''
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has inserted in a
supplemental spending bill a provision setting aside $10 million to
build and staff a U.S. embassy in Lithuania if the United States
formally recognizes the republic's independence.

<HEAD>Bold Economic Experiment To Unfold in Germany</HEAD>

   Just eight weeks from now, East Germans will
make more money, pay fewer taxes and see some of their savings
triple in size.
   But prices will surely rise, parts of bank accounts may be
frozen, and workers will still make only about a third as much as
their neighbors in the West.
   That is the scenario both Germanys predict will begin to unfold
July 2, when the countries proclaim economic unity and begin one of
history's most extraordinary experiments.
   East Germans will suddenly have greater access to better goods.
But the mere act of buying them may begin to put hundreds of
thousands of their countrymen out of work as East Germans shun
their country's goods for better Western ones.
   Factories and former state-run enterprises will be free to
compete in a free market shorn of Communist regulation. But they
will face Western competition and many will surely fold.
   While all of this is happening, investors may begin moving in to
tap the new consumer market and the cheap labor in the new economic
frontier. The investment may create new jobs, raise living
standards and, ultimately, bring parity between East and West.
   ``I am optimistic that there will be an economic awakening after
a period of pain,'' said Juergen Wagner, an economist with
Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of
East Germany, meeting Tuesday in Bonn, confirmed the two nations
will officially share an economy July 2.
   This is true unification to most Germans, for whom the cost of a
heating bill, the size of their pension and the price of their
apartment is more important than the ideological debate on the role
of a united Germany in a changing world.
   Anybody who thinks West Germany will simply load up tons of West
German marks and ship them across the border while East Germany
burns its virtually worthless old currency is right.
   Officials say enough uncirculated cash is sitting in the West
German Bundesbank to supply East Germany's banks. East Germany this
week began destroying tons of its own reserves to create space in
its treasury.
   In the fall, a new currency is expected to go into circulation
for both countries.
   Many details still need to be worked out. But by July 2, there
likely will be one German economy.
   West Germany's agreement to swap most of the East German marks
for West German marks at a 1-1 rate cleared a basic hurdle to
unifying the countries.
   West Germany's central bank had said anything but a 2-1 trade
could weaken the mighty West German mark, trigger inflation and
lead to higher interest rates.
   But on Monday, it bowed to political pressures, agreeing to back
the 1-1 plan put forward by the Kohl government.
   Economists, like prospective parents trying to predict the
appearance of their children, can only speculate on how the
offspring of this odd economic marriage will look.
   They do agree that three things will happen in East Germany
after July 2: East German prices will rise, thousands will be out
of work and some inflation may occur in West Germany.
   Nearly 9 million East Germans make on average 960 marks per
month. Nearly 90 percent of the women work, so most families are
two-income households.
   Right now, that 960 marks is worth about 320 West German marks
($190) at the official 3-1 exchange rate. But in July, East Germans
will get their full wages in West German marks (about $560).
   The catch is that West Germans now average nearly triple that
salary, and consumer goods are priced accordingly by the free
market.
   East Germans now pay relatively little for housing. Food is
heavily subsidized and jobs guaranteed.
   So what could happen in July? Economists predict prices will
rise to more closely reflect the market in the new nation.
   ``We'll see higher prices for groceries, energy, public tariffs,
railroads, and other things that are highly subsidized,'' said
Rudolf Zwiener of the German Institute for Economic Research in
West Berlin.
   Zwiener said East Germany will need some sort of price
protection to keep goods and rents affordable in the short term.
   One advantage East Germans will have, he said, is that they will
pay a smaller share of taxes under West Germany's progressive tax
system.
   But he said 1 million to perhaps 2 million could be jobless in a
year. East German factories and businesses will close as more East
Germans spend their new West German marks on better West German
products.
   Huge unemployment also is likely in the vast public sector.
   East German factories also have about $153 billion in debts
incurred by the old socialist regime. West Germany proposes
converting that to West marks at a 2-1 rate and assigning the debts
to the enterprises.
   The West Germans also want a 1-1 conversion rate on personal
savings of up to about $2,300, with amounts above that converted at
a 2-1 rate.
   East Germany is pressing for a higher ceiling. Zwiener predicts
the ceiling likely will be doubled, but with limits on how much
East Germans can withdraw right away.
   Many economists predict at least some inflation and higher
interest rates when so many more West German marks flood the
market. Zwiener predicts it will be slight.
   Wagner said he believes there will be enough growth to offset
the effects of inflation and higher interest rates.
   ``The capital that must go into (East Germany) will come from
all over the world,'' he said. ``The Japanese will invest a lot in
the country.''
   It's already happening, even though there is no real legal
system in place yet to allow it. Japan's Yamaha Motorcycles took
over a storefront in downtown East Berlin. West Germany's Dresdner
Bank has moved into a room at the city's Palace Hotel.
   Five weeks ago, Budget Rent-a-Car also checked into a
fourth-floor room at the Palace, set up two desks and began renting
Western cars.
   ``We're here unofficially,'' said a woman who answered the door.
``Everybody is.''

   The ``Gentleman Cowboy'' George Strait was
named entertainer of the year Wednesday, but former ironworker
Clint Black dominated the 25th Academy of Country Music awards with
four trophies.
   Kathy Mattea, who won best song last year for ``18 Wheels and a
Dozen Roses,'' got the same honor this year for ``Where've You
Been'' and won top female vocalist.
   The meticulously dressed, soft-spoken Strait got the top honor
after winning top male vocalist three times and top album once in
past years.
   ``It feels great and I really appreciate it. I sound suprised,
but I thought I had a good shot. To be chosen entertainer of the
year is very special,'' Strait said backstage at the Pantages
Theater in Hollywood.
   But the big surprise was newcomer Black, 28, who burst onto the
country music scene by picking up the singles award for ``Better
Man,'' his first single, and the album of the year for ``Killin'
Time,'' his debut record.
   He also won for male vocalist and new male vocalist. He lost
only to Mattea for best song.
   ``What a thrill this is,'' Black said.
   Black, who has been writing songs for 13 years, said ``Better
Man'' details the end of an affair that left him a better man.
   ``It's very special to me because it's a tribute to someone very
special to me _ a girlfriend of many years,'' Black said backstage.
   The winning song, ``Where've You Been,'' is also a deeply
personal work, especially for co-writer Jon Vezner, who is Mattea's
husband. The song, also written by Don Henry, is about a couple who
grow old in a nursing home.
   ``It was basically a true story about my grandparents,'' said
Venzer. ``It sat around for about a year and a half. We tried to
write songs that come from our hearts.''
   Hank Williams Jr., nominated for six awards, picked up one for
best video. In accepting, he read a sentimental letter to his
legendary father, Hank Williams Sr., who died in 1953.
   ``Dear Daddy: We finally got to sing together, and you left me
such a big hit. ... There's another place you'll always be and
that's right here in all our hearts,'' he read.
   An old demo tape of ``There's a Tear in my Beer'' was found in
the attic of songwriter ``Big Bill'' Lister. Hank Williams Jr. used
modern technology to record it as a duet with his father and to
appear with his father in the video.
   The Judds, the mother-daughter singing duo, won best vocal duet
trophy for the sixth consecutive year.
   ``You see, there really are guardian angels,'' said Naomi Judd,
as daughter Wynona beamed nearby.
   The 4-year-old Nashville band Restless Heart won best group,
while Mary Chapin Carpenter of Washington, D.C., was voted new
female vocalist.
   Top new group honors went to Kentucky Headhunters, a wild,
long-haired band that sports leather and suspenders.
   Asked if anyone had discussed the group's image, member Richard
Yong said, ``Nobody ever asked us to change anything. We just be
ourselves. What you see is what you have. We are on a campaign for
ugly people ... but we're very nice.''

   The academy's 2,500 members voted for the winners except for the
video of the year award, which is decided by a vote of the
academy's board of directors.
   Winners in instrumentalist categories, announced before the
show, included Michael Rhodes, bass; Steve Duncan, drums; Mark
O'Connor, fiddle; Brent Rowan, guitar; Skip Edwards, keyboard;
Jerry Douglas, specialty instrument (dobro); Jay Dee Maness, steel
guitar; Nashville Now Band, non-touring band; and Desert Rose Band,

   Maness won the steel guitar honor for the 12th time.

<TEXT>
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took the
presidential oath Wednesday, ending 11 years of leftist Sandinista
rule in Central America's largest country. She immediately
proclaimed a political amnesty and ended the military draft.
   ``This blessed Nicaragua, instead of burying its sons in a
fratricidal war, will bury its weapons forever, so the cannon will
never roar again,'' Mrs. Chamorro told a crowd of 20,000 inside a
Managua baseball stadium.
   But some combatants were not ready to lay down their arms.
Outside the mountain hamlet of El Destino, about 500 Contra rebels
rejected a call by a U.N. peacekeeper to begin handing over their
weapons about two hours after Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   An estimated 9,000 Contras inside Nicaragua are to gather in
coming days in five security enclaves inside Nicaragua for
demobilization. But many rebels are balking, unhappy with Mrs.
Chamorro's appointment of former President Daniel Ortega's brother
to head the army.
   At El Destino, rebel leader Israel Galeano invited the
guerrillas to surrender their weapons _ but first delivered a
stinging anti-Sandinista speech and vowed to be the last to lay
down his own gun.
   ``Anybody who wants to give up his rifle, come forward,''
Galeano told his fighters. The guerrillas laughed, and when one
shouted, ``Nobody gives up his gun!'' all cheered raucously.
   Leaders of the Contras, who have promised to disarm by June 10,
have been demanding Sandinista officers resign before they put down
their guns.
   Earlier, at the downtown stadium where the inauguration was
held, the atmosphere was often rowdy.
   Spectators on the Sandinista side hurled water balloons at Mrs.
Chamorro as she entered the stadium, and one splattered her skirt.
Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, were pelted with watermelon
rinds tossed by United National Opposition partisans as they made
their entrance.
   The transition follows nine years of a U.S.-backed insurgency in
which 30,000 people died. Mrs. Chamorro inherits a legacy of
suspicion and distrust, a nation of 3.5 million residents that
resembles an armed camp and an economy shattered by the U.S. trade
embargo and rampant inflation.
   The inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, a conservative elected in
February, brought immediate resumption of U.S. aid and trade
assistance.
   Ortega lashed at the United States _ which backed the Contra
rebels _ for supporting an ``unjust and cruel war.'' He promised to
lead a constructive opposition and said if civil war broke out
again, ``the elections would have been for nothing.''
   Mrs. Chamorro said Gen. Humberto Ortega, the ex-president's
brother, will head the army but that she herself would assume the
post of defense minister to ``direct personally the processes of
demobilization and demilitarization and to put an end to the war.''
   She said she would order Gen. Ortega to establish a plan to
reduce the size of the Sandinista army and got her biggest cheer
when she decreed an end to the extremely unpopular draft.
   Mrs. Chamorro also said she would grant ``a wide and
unconditional amnesty'' to those responsible for political crimes.
   The Ortega appointment drew objections from Mrs. Chamorro's
allies in the UNO, a coalition of 14 parties, and in the Contra
movement.
   At least two top prominent anti-Sandinista leaders said they
wouldn't serve in Mrs. Chamorro's Cabinet because of the Ortega
appointment. Gilberto Cuadra, president of Nicaragua's most
influential business organization, had been slotted as minister for
construction and transportation; Jaime Cuadra, unrelated to
Gilberto, had been designated agriculture minister.
   Dignitaries from 83 countries, including Vice President Dan
Quayle, and nine international organizations attended the
inauguration. Also present were members of the Sandinista Cabinet
and high-ranking officers of the Sandinista army.
   Envoys of nations that had been on unfriendly terms with the
Sandinistas entered the stadium to catcalls, boos and insults. El
Salvador's rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, and Quayle were
greeted with chants of ``Assassin, assassin.''
   Quayle carried a letter to Mrs. Chamorro from former President
Reagan, who told her that ``with your assumption of the presidency,
the people of Nicaragua can live in hope. Their freedoms can be
restored. Their dreams and aspirations can be met.''
   Quayle brought symbolic gifts of flour and cooking oil, the
first installment of $24 million in U.S. food aid. Nicaragua's
economy has faltered so much under last year's 1,800 percent
inflation rate that shortages of food occurred, requiring the
importing of such staples as beans and rice.
   He also brought word that President Bush has approved $2.5
million in medical supplies, signed a formal declaration saying
Nicaragua is no longer a Marxist-Leninist country, restored its
quota for sugar exports to the United States and made businesses
wishing to invest in the country eligible for low-cost government
loans.
   Quayle called Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration ``the miracle of
Managua.''
   In her speech, Mrs. Chamorro said she would ask the National
Assembly to ``repair injustices committed'' by seizure of property
under Sandinista rule, but added that peasants will be guaranteed
title to property redistributed under the Sandinista agrarian
reform program.
   She also said economic controls would be lifted in an effort to
spur economic production, a process already begun by the
Sandinistas.
   The streets of Managua were largely empty Wednesday, a national
holiday and the 21,000-seat stadium was nearly filled.
   After Mrs. Chamorro made her way onto the podium, using a crutch
because of a fractured knee, she kissed President Ortega.
   The elegant Mrs. Chamorro, dressed all in white, contrasted
sharply with the sporty Ortega, who wore a short-sleeve shirt in
black-and-white Sandinista colors.
   Mrs. Chamorro became a political icon after her husband Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, a newspaper editor, was assassinated during
dictator Anastasio Somoza's rule that ended with the 1979
Sandinista revolution.
   She and Ortega, a dedicated revolutionary who led the guerrilla
war against Somoza, were both members of the junta that took power.
But she became disenchanted with the Sandinistas, resigned from the
junta and became publisher of the family newspaper, La Prensa
   For years the paper was the leading voice of opposition and was
shut down on Ortega's orders several times.

<HEAD>God Save Our Anthem? Proposed Change Draws a Crusty Response</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A church proposal to scrap the pugnacious second
verse of ``God Save the Queen'' and replace it with rhymes about
brotherly love has drawn some crusty responses.
   They range from a worried editorial in the Times of London to
the bizarre spectacle of Auberon Waugh, acid-tongued son of the
novelist Evelyn Waugh, going on television with an off-key
rendition of his own lyrics.
   Currently, the second verse of the anthem goes:
   ``O Lord our God arise, Scatter her enemies, And make them fall;
Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On Thee
our hopes we fix; God save us all.''
   Some Church of England clerics feel such language is
inappropriate in an age of world brotherhood. The church's
Liturgical Commission has proposed a different verse:
   ``Nor on this land alone, But be God's mercies known, From shore
to shore. Lord, make the nations see, That men should brothers be,
And form one family, The wide world o'er.''
   Clerics point out that the bit about scattering enemies and
frustrating knavish tricks has fallen into disuse and that the
proposed substitute itself is more than 150 years old, having been
written in 1836 by a London shoemaker.
   There is no authorized version of ``God Save the Queen,'' and
the commission's proposal applies only to the singing of the anthem
at war memorial services.
   A government information sheet notes that ``Nowadays it is usual
on official occasions to sing the first verse only.''
   The anthem is not universally loved.
   ``The words are atrocious and the tune is worse,'' wrote Peter
McKay in The Evening Standard last month.
   But it is a powerful national symbol, capable just by its
opening drum roll of bringing a stadium full of people to attention.
   ``It is, maybe, a poorish thing musically, but it is our own and
on the whole we like it,'' wrote Margot Lawrence in The Daily
Telegraph.
   To some conservatives, the proposed change is just one more
attempt by the clergy to confuse red-blooded English folk with
wishy-washy sentiments about peace and brotherhood.
   Thus when ``Newsnight,'' BBC-TV's heavyweight nightly news
program, asked for expert advice, it got some sardonic responses.
   ``O Lord we got it wrong, For peace we now must throng, So pass
the cup,'' sang Waugh, editor of The Literary Review and
arch-defender of traditional English ways.
   Ian Hislop, editor of the satirical magazine Private Eye,
parodied diplomatic jargon by singing:
   ``O Lord our God arise, And report our enemies, To the United
Nations. Make them observe treaties, So hostilities may cease, And
we all then live in peace, With normal diplomatic relations.''
   On a slightly more serious note, The Times warned: ``Britain
built an empire whistling this tune, which remains a reassuring
part of its heritage, like brown boots, chestnut trees and summer
rain. ... Critics tamper with it at their peril.''
   First performed in 1745 as a riposte to the Jacobite rebels, the
anthem's melody was picked up, at various times, all over Europe,
as well as the United States where it became ``My country, 'tis of
thee...''
   Haydn, Beethoven and Brahms used the melody in compositions.
   Poets from Shelley onward promoted alternative lyrics. All
failed, except a London shoemaker named William Hickson, who in
1836 penned the brotherly love verse.
   Robin Brookes, consultant to the Liturgical Commission, said in
an interview that while the panel did not explain its reasons for
favoring the Hickson verse, ``It is clear that they don't regard
national sentiment as being sufficient in this world, and that
there ought to be an international flavor.''
   Brookes maintained that the fuss was contrived by newspapers
``to excite the conservative instincts most of us have.''
   Most of the protest has appeared in the letters columns of The
Times.
   A. H. Atkins wrote in to argue that the existing lyrics
``represent an outspoken and truly British sentiment.''
   Noel Brandon-Jones asked the commission to ``explain how God is
to save the queen without frustrating the knavish tricks of her
enemies, both at home and abroad.''

<TEXT>
   The fear of fire has gripped this city
after a series of blazes that left at least 11 people dead and
25,000 homeless.
   On Wednesday, 4,000 makeshift homes in three shantytowns on the
northwestern outskirts of the capital were destroyed in a fire,
officials said.
   Hundreds of poor men, women and children, wailing and pleading
for food, stopped traffic and stoned cars, saying relief efforts
were inadequate.
   On Tuesday, fire engulfed 5,000 straw and mud huts in the
northeastern district. On Monday, 3,000 shacks were consumed by
flames in the center of the city, and 11 people were killed.
   Last week, fires destroyed 600 shops and New Delhi's only
convention center.
   Fires are common in northern India during the hot, dry summer,
when a spark from an unextinguised match can spawn an inferno
within minutes. The latest outbreak is worse than usual, but
investigators say they have found no evidence of foul play.
   ``At least 25,000 people have been rendered homeless by the
fires,'' said A.K. Sharma, a social worker. ``Look at that,'' he
said pointing to row after row of burned huts in the Motia Khan
area. ``They were once homes.''
   Sharma said no government relief has been forthcoming. ``Only
the political parties are running a limited show of relief,'' he
said.
   Israr Ahmed, a spokesmen for the city government, denied the
government is not helping the fire victims.
   ``We are providing clean drinking water, bread and milk,'' he
said.
   Ahmed said financial compensation would be forthcoming _ about
$1,175 to the next of kin of those who died, $175 to the seriously
injured and $30 for each destroyed hut.
   Those hardest hit by the fires are residents of the shantytowns
that have sprung up all over this sprawling city. According to
government statistics, 1.2 million of New Delhi's 8 million
residents live in improvised camps of tents and huts fashioned from
mud, straw and cardboard.
   The shantytowns have no civic facilities such as running water
and sewers.
   Most residents are poor laborers from rural areas who descend on
New Delhi in search of jobs. They also provide blocs of votes that
can determine the fate of elections.
   ``I came to New Delhi 15 years ago,'' said Ram Bilas, who lost
his 10-by-10 foot hut in the Motia Khan fire Monday. Bilas and 11
relatives are now camping outside.
   ``I was given this plot of land five years ago by a politician
after I promised him all the seven votes in my family,'' Bilas, 55,
said.
   Sita Ram, 35, lost half of his 40 pigs in the fire. ``I had
invested all my money in the business, now half is lost,'' he said
as he set out to seek leftover food from restaurants for his pigs.
   ``Never before have we had so many cases of serious and medium
fires in one week affecting residential areas,'' a senior fire
official said on condition of anonymity.
   Fire officials said there was no indication of arson.
   ``We don't have any evidence yet,'' said another fire official,
also speaking on condition of anonymity. ``April-June are the peak
months for fire in northern India, but we admit we are swamped this
time.''
   The blazes have exposed inadequate firefighting and fire
prevention facilities.
   The Delhi Fire Service has a total of 125 fire engines and 1,100
firefighters who are hard pressed to cover the rapidly expanding
city.
   In addition, there are 158 high-rise buildings that do not meet
regulations for such things as fire alarms, fire exits and
sufficient water supplies. According to reports published in major
newspapers, half the buildings are owned by the government.

<TEXT>
   The world's estimated 1 billion Moslems
today celebrate the end of the Islamic fast month of Ramadan, when
the faithful abstain from food, drink and sex from dawn-to-dusk.
   Gun salvos and prayer calls from minarets echoed throughout the
Persian Gulf at twilight Wednesday to herald the beginning of Eid
al-Fitr, the feast of the fast-breaking.
   But the rejoicing was restrained. Casting their shadow were such
regional issues as the protracted rift between Saudi Arabia and
Iran, the plight of the Palestinians and the 15-year-old civil war
in Lebanon.
   Sunni Moslems, the preponderant sect of Islam, quickly began
their celebrations after the cresent moon was sighted in Saudi
Arabia, marking the end of the fast month. Saudi Arabia is home to
Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   It was not clear whether predominantlty Shiite Iran would ignore
the call and rely on local authorities for an independent sighting.
   Shiites make up less than 10 percent of the world's Moslems, and
have generally had poor relations with their Sunni neighbors.
   In mosques throughout the region, worshippers piled plastic
sheets high with donations of lamb and rice, dates, coffee pots,
milk puddings, and nut pastries.
   The food is generally donated to Moslems who cannot afford the
traditional festive meal that ends the fast.
   Families also exchange a special honey walnut pastry for the
holiday. In some Moslem countries preparing the small pastries has
become a virtual necessity. In recent years a number of divorces
have been recorded when husbands failed to provide money for the
holiday pastries.
   The fast month of Ramadan marks the time Islamic tradition holds
that the angel Gabriel revealed the Moslem holy book, the Koran, to
the prophet Mohammed 14-centuries ago.

   The National Park Service has banned sales
at two parks of a poster favoring the return of the wolf to
Yellowstone.
   Defenders of Wildlife, a private agency, was using proceeds from
sales of the $25 posters to ease opposition to the animal's return
in Montana by compensating ranchers whose calves and sheep are
killed by wolves.
   But the Park Service, saying it was improper for park stores to
advocate wolf restoration when the issue is being debated in
Congress, banned sales of the posters this week at Yellowstone and
at Glacier National Park in Montana.
   The posters portray four howling wolves with the legend:
``Restoring the Wolf to Yellowstone.''
   Park officials appear to be divided over restoration.
   Former Park Service Director William Penn Mott Jr. strongly
supported the return of wolves to Yellowstone, and the park's
superintendent, Bob Barbee, has called the animals the ``missing
link'' in the park's ecosystem. But James Ridenour, who replaced
Mott last summer, has said he opposes restoration.
   Ranchers drove the wolf from Yellowstone at the turn of the
century. Under the plan being debated in Congress, about 10
breeding pairs of wolves would be captured elsewhere and released
in the park.
   Ranchers oppose the plan for fear the wolves will attack their
herds outside the park.
   Since last fall, Defenders of Wildlife has sold almost 6,000
copies of the poster, some at the parks and some by mail, said Hank
Fischer, a leader of the group.
   The group's reimbursement fund, which holds about $60,000, has
eased ranchers' opposition to wolves in Montana, said Fischer. The
fund in the last three years has reimbursed several ranchers whose
livestock was killed by wolves from Canada.
   Fischer characterized the ban on poster sales as censorship.
   Mott ``was really the inspiration behind the program,'' Fischer
said in an interview from his Missoula, Mont., office. ``So it's
terribly disappointing to us not to be able to sell this poster in
the national park.''
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., who along with Sen. Alan Simpson,
R-Wyo., opposes the return of the wolves, said he was happy
Defenders of Wildlife would no longer be allowed to peddle their
``propaganda'' in Yellowstone.

<HEAD>Five Amateur Star-Gazers Get Chance at Big Time on Space Telescope</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James J. Secosky, a Shortsville, N.Y., school
teacher, spent a summer of his youth mowing lawns to buy a $20
telescope so he could spend clear nights gazing heavenward at
billions of stars.
   Ana Larson, a Seattle housewife, studied astronomy by
correspondence while raising two children and began to wonder if
there was intelligent life ``somewhere out there.''
   Peter J. Kandefer saw Sputnik, history's first artificial
satellite, pass overhead in 1957 and then later sighted two comets.
``After that, I was hooked on astronomy,'' he said.
   Now they are in the group of five amateur astronomers who will
be given ``viewing time'' on the Hubble Space Telescope, a $1.5
billion orbiting instrument that may give the best look ever of the
universe.
   ``This is absolutely unprecedented,'' said Kandefer, 43, a New
Hartford, Conn., electrical engineer. ``Amateurs just never get
access to university telescopes to do study of their own. There is
just too much demand on that equipment from the professionals.''
   But Riccardo Giacconi, director of the Space Telescope Science
Institute, decided to give amateurs a chance. He set aside part of
his discretionary time on the Hubble and invited amateur astronomy
organizations to select viewing projects proposed by their members.
   ``I expect that amateur astronomers will use the Hubble Space
Telescope to ask refreshing new questions and that their findings
will make a real contribution to the advancement of astronomy,'' he
said.
   The Hubble telescope was released Wednesday from the end of a
50-foot-long mechanical arm on the space shuttle Discovery.
   In addition to Kandefer, Secosky and Larson, the amateurs
selected from the hundreds who proposed projects were Ray Sterner
of Woodbine, Md., and T. John Hewitt of Berkeley, Calif.
   Kandefer's study target is one of the most commonly seen points
of light in the sky _ a star in the handle of the Big Dipper known
as HD112185.
   The star, which is 110 light years away, is one of a small group
of known variable stars. These are light sources that vary in
intensity at set intervals.
   ``It changes in a regular fashion every 5.9 days and has been
observed for well over 40 years,'' said Kandefer. The change, so
slight that it takes instruments to measure, may reveal details
about star composition and formation.
   ``It's such a tough star to measure, it's really beyond the
capabilities of Earth-based telescopes,'' Kandefer said. But Hubble
will be able to make the observations with 10-minute glimpses over
a five-night period.
   Kandefer said the data he will receive will be ``charts with
squiggly lines'' that he then will analyze on his personal computer.
   For Secosky, a 42-year-old high school science teacher, the
Hubble will focus on a moon of Jupiter called Io.
   ``Io is very interesting because it has active volcanoes and
lakes of liquid sulfur,'' said Secosky.
   He hopes to learn why Io changes in brightness when it moves in
and out of the frigid shadow of Jupiter. The Hubble will be looking
for evidence of frost forming on the moon and will take a series of
images just as it moves from the shadow into light.
   Secosky's Hubble experiment continues an intellectual adventure
that started in high school when he mowed lawns at 50 cents an hour
to earn money for a telescope.
   ``In high school, every clear night I was out looking at the
stars for hours,'' he recalls.
   But astronomy remained a hobby. Secosky earned a master's degree
in biology, has taught high school science for 18 years and is
raising a family.
   Ana Larson, the Seattle mother of two, started on her own but
plans to become a professional astronomer.
   She first took astronomy by correspondence while raising a son
and a daughter and now, at 42, she hopes to use what she learns
from the Hubble studies for a master's thesis in astronomy.
   Her interest centers on one of the most fundamental questions of
astronomy: Is there life beyond the solar system? Larson's Hubble
project is to look for planets orbiting other suns in other solar
systems.
   ``If we can find just a single planet, then that leads to the
idea that, yes, there is life out there,'' said Larson. However,
she admits, ``I get this nagging feeling in the back of my mind
that perhaps we are alone.''
   The Hubble will look for small points of heat about a select
group of stars. Larson said the plan is to detect the heat that is
generated as matter comes together to form planets.
   Sterner, who works at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics
Laboratory in Baltimore, will focus his study on mysterious arcs of
light that have been seen in distant galaxy clusters. He thinks the
arcs may be caused by a gravitational effect that bends light as
does an optical lens.
   Hewitt's project will be conducted only if a star explodes
sometime during the year after Hubble is launched. He will be
looking for a comet cloud that scientists believe forms around all
stars.
   The cloud cannot be seen normally, but an exploding star would
provide a burst of light, rather like a flashbulb, to illuminate
the distant wisp of matter.

<HEAD>Tranquil Himalayan Kingdom Turning Into Sea of Hatred</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This tranquil Himalayan kingdom's capital
is becoming a sea of violence and hatred, and the latest target is
the police force widely despised for its longtime repression of
pro-democracy activits.
   Until a few months ago, Nepal was known more for its mountains,
tourist resorts and trekking trails than for riots, curfews and
shootings by police.
   Then came a crescendo of people power. Police tried to crush it
and failed. In mid-April, King Birendra loosened his grip on
absolute power and let the long-banned political opposition take
the reins of government.
   A backlash against the old system has been let loose, and the
police are the target.
   ``The pro-democracy activists were harassed so much (by the
police) that the hatred became so intense,'' said Lok Raj Baral, a
professor of political science at Katmandu's Tribhuvan University.
   ``The people really hate us like anything,'' a police inspector
said, a steel helmet on his head and a bamboo shield wrapped around
his body. He spoke from the safe side of a locked gate at his
police station.
   On Monday, mobs captured and beat to death six policemen,
accusing them of belonging to an underground right-wing,
pro-monarchy group. Two of the victims were paraded through the
streets and pummeled for six hours before they died. Police shot
back and five civilians were killed.
   At least 17 policemen were injured when the marauding crowd
attacked several police stations.
   On Wednesday, angry policemen chanting ``Blood for blood!''
called for revenge at a funeral for some of the officers.
   The violence came 2{ weeks after police fired on a crowd of
200,000 pro-democracy demonstrators, killing scores of people in
the worst day of violence in Nepal in more than a century.
Witnesses claimed as many as 200 people died in the April 6
shootings.
   King Birendra's government maintained that only 10 people died,
but two days later the monarch bowed to demands for democracy and
ended a 29-year ban on political parties. A coalition government
dominated by pro-democracy forces took office April 19.
   After Monday's riots, thousands of police went into hiding. The
mobs had echoed the widespread belief in Katmandu that police
condoned _ and sometimes joined _ the right-wing Mandale
underground group.
   The Mandale was blamed for arson, mugging and looting that
followed the April 19 installation of the new government. Police
officials claim the crime rate has not increased significantly.
   ``It is just a psychological fear of the Mandale,'' said a
senior police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Baral suggested the linking of the police force with the Mandale
was only an excuse to ``release the pent-up violence of 29 years.''
   The Mandale, an abbreviated form of Nepal Vidyarthi Mandal, or
Nepal Students Group, went underground in 1979 after King Birendra
officially banned it because of its predilection for violence. But
the Mandale remain the most hated and feared symbol of the monarchy.
   ``The easiest way of committing suicide in Nepal today is to
proclaim oneself a Mandale member,'' Baral said.
   He said the recent violence against police grew out of
psychological fear of the Mandale and a hatred of police tactics.
   ``The Nepalese are becoming more and more violent. People are
getting used to killings. Their killer instinct has been aroused,''
he said.
   Political demonstrations and overt opposition to the monarchy
were virtually unknown in Nepal after 1961 when Birendra's father,
King Mahendra, dismissed the 20-month-old democratically elected
government of the Nepali Congress party and introduced a partyless
system of government.
   Dissent against the system, inspired by the political changes in
Eastern Europe, grew only in the last year.
   Nepal's first mass popular movement was launched Feb. 18 by the
Nepali Congress and the United Left Front, a coalition of left-wing
parties. The two formerly banned groups now dominate the new
Cabinet.
   Several pro-democracy activists have alleged that they were
tortured in police detention. The methods included being immersed
in cold water for hours at a time and having pins forced under
their finger nails, they said.
   The hatred for police appears to have deep roots. ``They are
policemen by morning and terrorists by night,'' said taxi driver
Salik Ram, spitting vehemently out his car window.
   Meanwhile, the government is caught between the deteriorating
law and order and its inability to use the police, with its
near-zero credibility, to control crime.

<TEXT>
   The shell game's over, Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles. Call off the Hunt for Red October. Drive Miss Daisy
somewhere else.
   Here comes the judge _ to a theater near you.
   When the film version of Judge Edwin Torres' novel ``Q &amp; A''
debuts Friday, a name ordinarily affixed to court orders will be
splashed across the silver screen.
   The movie, directed by Sidney Lumet, stars Timothy Hutton as a
young prosecutor caught in a web of corruption. It is taken from
one of three books Torres wrote in the mid-1970s, when he was a
prosecutor.
   News of the movie has brought Torres much attention and some
ribbing from colleagues and attorneys. One morning he arrived at
the courthouse carrying a full-page ad for the movie, prompting one
court officer to say, ``Remember, I knew you when you were a mere
mortal.''
   At 59, the stern-faced, slightly graying Torres looks like
central casting's idea of a judge. In 13 years on the bench, he has
earned a reputation for handing out stiff sentences; he said most
of his cases are ``career criminals'' and ``lost causes.''
   ``They gravitate toward me, a lot of the heavier cases ... guys
with records that boggle the imagination,'' he said with a heavy
New York accent in a recent interview. ``So what is one to do
except, you know, bang 'em.''
   Torres saw many of his peers go the same route while growing up
on the crime-ridden streets of Spanish Harlem.
   He got out, he said, thanks to luck and strict parental
supervision.
   ``My experience is certainly not unique,'' he said. ``Plenty of
guys come out of Harlem, the South Bronx, Bed-Stuy
(Bedford-Stuyvesant, an area of Brooklyn). They just don't make the
news copy as often as the bad guys do.''
   Sitting with his feet up on a table in the jury room next to his
courtroom, Torres described himself as a ``happy-go-lucky guy''
who, after three years in the Navy during the Korean War, toyed
with the idea of becoming a police officer.
   Instead, at his father's insistence, he enrolled in Brooklyn Law
School, then joined the Manhattan district attorney's office.
   Torres said he never set out to be a writer either, but sat down
at a desk late one night at his wife's urging after hearing him
complain about the way Hollywood portrayed life on the streets.
   ``She said, `If you can do it better, why don't you do it?''' he
said.
   A ``dyed-in-the-wool movie devotee,'' Torres said, ``I never
intended to write novels. What I thought I was writing were more
screenplays or screen vehicles.''
   But he did write three well-received novels _ ``Carlito's Way,''
``Q &amp; A'' and ``After Hours'' _ full of authentic characters culled
from his youth and his professional experience.
   The movie interest came right away, he said. People like David
Susskind, Francis Ford Coppola and Al Pacino paid to option his
books but never developed them into films.
   ``I didn't think they ever made movies after a while,'' he said.
``I thought they bought options maybe for tax purposes.''
   Two years ago, Torres dropped off a copy of ``Q &amp; A'' with
Lumet, known for gritty New York films like ``Serpico,'' ``Dog Day
Afternoon'' and ``Prince of the City.''
   ``Within a week, he immediately jumped on it,'' Torres said.
``The next thing I knew the thing was in full gear.''

<TEXT>
   The heirs of Edward Steichen, a pillar
of New York's Museum of Modern Art, are battling the museum over an
$800,000 painting by Matisse that was bequeathed to the
photographer's 6-year-old great-granddaughter.
   Although Steichen and his family have been longtime benefactors,
the museum is refusing to hand over the painting, which has been in
the photography pioneer's family since Henri Matisse gave it to him
in 1908.
   The museum argues the painting loaned to them by Steichen's
youngest daughter in 1973 was meant as a permanent gift, even
though Kate Steichen in her will left the work to her grandniece,
Ariana Rodina Calderone Stahmer of Pennington, N.J.
   Lawyers for the estate contend the museum is waging a war of
attrition against a modest estate, a strategy they say may
eventually backfire.
   ``Who else is going to lend works to the Museum of Modern Art if
they're afraid they'll treat loans as gifts?'' asked attorney L.
Douglas Shrader, who filed suit in federal court this month to
force the museum to relinquish the painting and for $1 million in
damages. ``In the securities area, in which I usually work, that
would be regarded as a fraud.''
   Matisse presented Edward Steichen with the painting, ``Vue de
Collioure a l'Eglise,'' in 1908 to thank him for helping arrange
the first American exhibition of his works and to commemorate the
birth of Steichen's daughter Kate.
   Steichen gave her the painting on her 53rd birthday, and she in
turn loaned it to the museum in 1973, the year her father died. She
also bequeathed the painting to the museum, continuing the
relationship established by her father. He had run its photography
department from 1947 to 1962 and put together a number of
exhibitions, including the widely viewed ``The Family of Man.''
   ``She had given the museum works by her father, works of Rodin,
and she's a woman of very modest means. She's been very generous to
that museum because of the Steichen family connection,'' Shrader
said. ``Why they're taking this tack with a family that's been so
good to them over the years is a mystery.''
   But Miss Steichen, who lived in Wilton, Conn., changed her will
in 1978 and bequeathed the painting to her sister, Mary Calderone.
Shrader said Miss Steichen was upset because the museum had touched
up a splotch of paint that Matisse had apparently put on the
painting by accident.
   ``Her feeling was, `Look, if Matisse had wanted to clean up this
blob, he would have done it himself,''' Shrader said.
   Miss Steichen changed her will again in 1985, leaving the
painting to her sister's grandchild. When Miss Steichen died in
1988, the estate contacted the museum to obtain the painting for
the little girl.
   Museum officials said they are sorry the relationship with the
Steichen family has soured but contend the work is theirs. They say
they were never told Miss Steichen had changed her will and only
learned of the change when she died of cancer in 1988. In the
meantime, they gave up opportunities to acquire other paintings
from that period.
   Museum Director Richard E. Oldenburg said Miss Steichen fully
intended to make the painting a gift, citing a 1973 letter to the
museum in which she thanked ``God that my little Matisse is home
safe.''
   ``As an institution we have to rely on good faith the promises
that are made to us, especially when no one ever tells us about the
changes,'' said Kirk Varnedoe, museum director of painting and
sculpture.
   Ariana's mother, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, said she wants to
preserve the sense of history that the painting, a view of a town
in southern France, represents to the family.
   ``I guess I feel just very strongly it's something that went
from Matisse to my grandfather and from my grandfather to my aunt,
and she wanted to pass it on to Ariana,'' she said. ``And I feel if
my aunt wanted to pass it on, that was her right.''
   The painting, which Ariana's parents have said they planned to
hang in her bedroom, remains on display in one of the museum's
galleries.
   No hearing date on the lawsuit has been set in federal court in
New Haven.

   The nation's leading political
movement, Civic Forum, and the environmental Green Party have
formed a partnership just days before the election campaign
formally begins.
   While stopping short of forming a coalition, the groups said
they will cooperate as ``representatives of public initiatives not
tainted by the political legacy of the past,'' the official CTK
news agency said Wednesday.
   Sources within Civic Forum said on condition of anonymity that
the parties could form a coalition later.
   Civic Forum and the Green Party issued a joint communique that
called on local party chapters and members to ``pursue ...
relations of partnership and cooperation based on the similarity of
common objectives.''
   Civic Forum led the peaceful popular uprising that toppled the
hard-line Communist regime of Milos Jakes last year and is so far
the strongest contender heading into the country's first free
elections in four decades.
   The campaign formally begins next week for the elections on June
8 and 9.
   The Greens, although previously unknown in Czechoslovakia, are
also high in the polls with an estimated 11 percent of the
population ready to support them.

   House Democratic leaders tout their budget as
a forward-looking alternative to President Bush's plan, but
conservatives within their party say it's equally lacking in
political courage.
   ``I am angry,'' said conservative Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., as
the House began debate Wednesday on the $1.2 trillion blueprint for
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. ``It is another example of
dodging important issues.''
   The leaders' budget would cut $8 billion from the president's
$303.8 billion Pentagon spending request for next year, and put
most of that money toward domestic programs such as space, AIDS
research and education.
   ``It is time we rebuild America, restore our economic leadership
in the world and begin to address unmet needs,'' said Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., principal author of the
plan.
   The House planned today to debate two Republican alternatives to
the Democratic plan, one a partial freeze on spending at current
levels and the other to cut red ink through the use of gold-backed
bonds to refinance the national debt.
   Final action on the House budget is planned next week. House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Wednesday he was
confident the leadership plan would prevail.
   But McCurdy said he ``wouldn't count those votes yet.'' With
Republicans unified in their opposition, it was possible
conservative Democrats could sink the plan.
   But Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, said that while his fellow
conservatives were frustrated, most would stick with the leadership
in order to move things toward a budget summit with the White House.
   Panetta conceded more needed to be done to reduce the deficit
than the $36 billion in claimed savings in his plan. But he said
that without Bush's leadership it couldn't pass.
   ``There is a difference between posturing on tough choices and
getting the institution to adopt tough, hard choices,'' he said.
   In the Senate, the Budget Committee was scheduled today to
continue work on its version of the budget. Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn., has been struggling to find consensus among
his Democrats without success.
   The budget plan that finally emerges will be the basis for
individual spending bills for government programs later this year.

<HEAD>Drug `War Bond' Bill Attacked by Democrats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular Republican plan to finance the drug
war with tax-deferred savings bonds is under attack by Democrats
who call it another step away from pay-as-you-go government.
   Senior Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee
complained that if the drug war is so important, Republicans should
be willing to raise taxes to pay for it rather than passing the
cost to future generations through borrowing.
   ``There's another addiction occurring in this country _ an
addiction to debt,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said Wednesday as
the committee heard testimony on the drug-bonds bill.
   ``If the war on drugs, the education deficit we have, the war on
crime are truly national priorities, we should be honest and pay
for them,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
committee.
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chief sponsor of the bonds bill,
defended it as a practical way to get Americans _ especially school
children _ directly involved in fighting drugs.
   As important as it is to reduce the budget deficit, Lewis said,
``The No. 1 priority ... way ahead of anything else, is drugs.''
   Lewis' bill, cosponsored by 249 of the 435 House members, would
authorize the Treasury Department to issue up to $4 billion in
savings bonds. As with present savings bonds, taxation of interest
could be delayed until they were redeemed. The bonds would pay for
education, building prisons and other anti-drug programs.
   A key part of the proposal would allow children to save their
nickels and dimes to buy 25-cent savings stamps. A filled stamp
book could be exchanged for a savings bond, in much the same way
that Americans helped finance World War II.
   ``Isn't it better to interest students in fighting drug abuse
and saving for their future in the second grade, before they are
hooked by crack in the sixth grade?'' Lewis asked.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who chairs the House Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control, questioned whether ``we should be
borrowing from our children to teach them the dangers of drugs''
when many of the most vulnerable children are the poorest.
   Endorsing the bill were representatives from the Elks and the
General Federation of Women's Clubs. So did television cop Dennis
Franz of ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``Nasty Boys.''
   The National Beer Wholesalers' Association announced its support
and pledged to buy the first $100,000 in bonds.
   Roger Chapin, president of Citizens for a Drug-Free America and
an author of the bond proposal, said the nation does not want a
protracted state-federal battle over who should command the drug
war.
   ``The fact is that we taxpayers are going to wind up paying the
bill in any case, and we don't much care what portion comes out of
our right pocket to pay the IRS or out of our left pocket to pay
the states,'' he said.
   Rep. Fortney Stark, D-Calif., contended the bond bill is part of
a larger plan by some Republicans and conservatives to force
sterilization of drug-addicted mothers and set up ``Nazi-like
prison camps'' where guards ``can beat some sense into offenders.''
   Lewis denied any such intent. However, Chapin recommended the
bonds be used for ``a demonstration work-study `boot camp' that
would not only shake up young adult offenders, but more
importantly, shape them up with the education and skills necessary
to a productive, trouble-free life.''
   The Treasury Department spoke against the bill, as it does
against most proposals to issue bonds for special projects.

   The United States could have its smallest Army
since 1940 if troop cuts under study by top Army officials are
enacted.
   Army Secretary Michael Stone says some one-third of the Army's
soldiers could be removed from the ranks over the next five or six
years if budget pressures continue.
   ``We think the Army is going to come down somewhere in the
neighborhood of 200,000 to 250,000 people from a baseline of
750,000'' active-duty soldiers, Stone told a Pentagon-sponsored
panel this week.
   Stressing that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney hadn't made the
final decisions, Stone said such cuts ``would mean that the Army is
going to be something around one-third lower than it is today in
force structure by the time that we get to ... 1995 to 1996.''
   Stone made the comments in a speech Monday evening to the
Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services. A tape of his
remarks was made available by the Army.
   The Army has the largest segment of the nation's
2.1-million-strong military force, and thus is the biggest target
for possible budget savings.
   Army officials acknowledge that they are being forced to look to
personnel cuts to salvage money for training and other accounts
that would leave them with a smaller, but what they believe will be
an effective, fighting force.
   Telling his audience ``there are three stages of force reduction
that we're looking at,'' Stone described proposals Army officials
have been mulling over in response to budget pressures and the
apparent lessened Soviet threat.
   In response to a request last year from Cheney, the Army made
plans in its current budget to cut about 135,000 troops by 1994,
Stone said.
   Additional cutbacks are being reviewed to strip an additional
50,000 from the Army in a second-stage cutback, he said. The
decisions will be made ``in the next few months'' as Cheney reviews
the military services' five-year budget plans.
   Pentagon sources reported two weeks ago that the Army was
planning such cuts, which would bring the Army to a low of 580,000
troops by Oct. 1, 1996, the beginning of the 1997 fiscal year.
   At the end of January, the Defense Department's count of
soldiers stood at 760,818, and the preliminary headcount for the
end of February was 755,164.
   There were 269,023 people in the Army in 1940. The number
skyrocketed to 8.2 million in 1945 at the end of World War II and
dropped to 554,030 by 1948.
   There were 780,000 people in the Army in 1986, Stone said,
adding ``we've come down a fair chunk'' in a short time.
   The cutbacks, he said, are coming at a time when the threat is
uncertain. ``All we know is, there is a lot of uncertainty.''
   Stone said the discussion of the troubles afflicting the Soviet
economy reminds him of ``what happened in Germany in the early
1930s, when out of the economic chaos ... arose somebody we've
learned a great deal about _ Mr. Hitler.''
   ``Instability can produce some things that are pretty difficult
to handle,'' he said.

   The government could close banks convicted of
money-laundering under a House-approved bill that critics contend
still leaves a giant loophole for drug kingpins to hide their
illicit earnings.
   On a 406-0 vote Wednesday, the House approved a bill that, for
the first time, would let regulators revoke the charters and
deposit insurance of banks and savings and loan institutions
convicted of money-laundering.
   However, under intense opposition from the Bush administration,
the Federal Reserve and the banking industry, the House refused to
take the first step toward making banks keep detailed records on
the source and destination of wire transfers through which most
drug profits are funneled.
   The House defeated, 283-127, an amendment by Rep. Esteban
Torres, D-Calif., to establish a pilot program in drug center
cities that would require banks to keep records of the names,
addresses and account numbers of parties on both sides of a wire
transfer.
   Opponents of the amendment, including most members of the House
Banking Committee, contended it would impose a burdensome new
record-keeping requirement on banks and thrift institutions.
   ``A misstep here could cost hundreds of millions of dollars,''
said Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga.. ``While very well-meaning, this
amendment is overkill.''
   Barnard, a former banker, said the amendment could lead to
adding a $10 to $15 paperwork cost to each of the 100 million wire
transfers handled by U.S. financial institutions annually.
   Supporters of the amendment, however, contended the bill is a
``bucket without a bottom'' for snaring launderers of drug money if
there is no way to trace the source and destination of wire
transfers.
   ``I hope we come to the day sometime when all of us are against
the drug traffickers more rather than concerned about how much of a
burden we're placing on our banking friends,'' said Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics.
   ``If you don't think the banking industry doesn't know what
these drug traffickers are doing _ and are not making a big profit
off of it _ you're putting us on,'' Rangel said.
   The bill is aimed at addressing the $110 billion in U.S. cash
drug transactions that the Treasury Department estimates are
laundered through the world financial system every year despite
laws to thwart it.
   ``We put the street dealer in jail and we put the drug kingpin
in the penitentiary, but no one has found a way to imprison a
bank,'' said the bill's chief author, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.
   ``When you consider that a money-launderer can earn $10,000
laundering just a single day's take for a drug dealer, you realize
just how inadequate mere fines are,'' he said. ``The provisions
hold out the death penalty for any financial institution convicted
of money-laundering.''
   As originally introduced, the House bill would have required
regulators to lift the charter and deposit insurance of banks
convicted of money-laundering. Because of opposition from the
administration and the bank and thrift lobbies, it was weakened in
the House Banking Committee's financial institutions subcommittee.
   However, the bill does mandate hearings on revoking the charter
and deposit insurance of a bank or S&amp;L within 30 days after the
institution and two or more of its senior officers are convicted of
money-laundering.
   In the hearings, regulators would have to consider the extent of
involvement in money-laundering by senior managers of the bank or
S&amp;L, the institution's cooperation with law enforcement officials
and steps it had taken to prevent the practice.
   In addition, the bill would prohibit anyone convicted of
money-laundering from working in a financial institution again and
would raise from $500 to $5,000 the possible fines for civil
violations.
   Similar legislation in the Senate is awaiting action by the
Senate Banking Committee.

   Musician Graham Nash, who has been collecting
photographs for nearly 20 years, had only 28 left after auctioning
off 1,800 for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   ``I've never really owned them. How can you own beauty?'' Nash
said during the sale at Sotheby's on Wednesday. ``It was time to
let go.''
   There was one photograph Nash wouldn't give up: it shows Marilyn
Monroe ``when she was 16 years old, unravaged by time and fame. ...
It cost me $20. It's priceless to me,'' he said.
   But Nash already is starting to collect new prints _ he bought
three during his visit to New York. ``I find it addictive,'' he
said.
   Nash, of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash and other groups, started
collecting in earnest in 1971, when he purchased ``Child With a Toy
Hand Grenade in Central Park,'' by Diane Arbus.
   ``The moment is chilling; the madness of war seemed to
crystallize in that photograph,'' Nash wrote in the auction
catalog. That photo sold for $46,750.
   The auction included three photos by Paul Outerbridge that sold
for a total of $264,000; a rare signed Ansel Adams print titled
``Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico,'' for $49,500; an Edward
Steichen portrait of Gloria Swanson in a black veil, for $16,500,
and ``Charlie Chaplin on the Set of Limelight,'' by W. Eugene
Smith, for $6,050.
   Nash, who lives in Los Angeles, said he would donate some of the
proceeds _ no total was immediately available _ to the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.

   Joe Flanagan, executive director of the Women's European Tour,
said the golfer from San Francisco was barred from the $68,000
match for ``bringing the tour into disrespect.''
   Spencer-Devlin, 36, refused a request that she sit with the rest

tournament director David Parkin, she walked out.
   ``She made an entrance and exit in the grand manner, dressed
like a '20s cabaret star'' Flanagan said.
   Giving her account of the incident, Spencer-Devlin said:
``Parkin said, `You are to sit here'. I slammed my fist down on the
table twice, said I am an American and I am not to be treated this
way. Then I walked out.''
   Spencer-Devlin, who has finished second and third in the British

   A $3.4 billion spending bill in Congress
includes everything from former Panamanian dictator Manuel
Noriega's court costs to money for fish farming and a war on
grasshoppers.
   Through the magic of amendments, President Bush's $870 million
aid request for Nicaragua and Panama has multiplied along its route
to the Senate, which begins debate on the measure today.
   The add-ons include such items as:
   _$185 million to build an automated fingerprint identification
laboratory planned in Clarksburg, W.Va., the home state of
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   _$7.4 million to cover increased court expenses in Florida,
Georgia and Alabama, which have handled not only Noriega's case but
an influx of other extradited drug suspects. Noriega is awaiting
trial in Miami.
   _$8 million for the Agriculture Department to combat
grasshoppers in the state of committee member Quentin Burdick,
D-N.D., as well as in South Dakota and Minnesota.
   _An order for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration to begin building a fish farming experimental
laboratory at Stuttgart, Ark. Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., is a
member of the appropriations panel.
   Supplemental appropriations bills, regarded as ``must-pass''
measures because they are requested by the president, each year
become vehicles for pet projects of lawmakers.
   The bill began as an $870 million request from Bush to pay for
three items not envisioned in the 1990 budget: $300 million in aid
for Nicaragua, $500 million for Panama and $70 million for refugee
programs.
   When the House took it up, the measure grew to $2.4 billion with
the addition of disaster relief for flooding in the Southeast
(House Appropriations Chairman Jamie Whitten is a Mississippi
Democrat); low-income energy assistance for the Northeast (senior
committee Republican Silvio Conte is from Massachusetts); money for
veterans' health care and pensions, food stamps and Forest Service
firefighting.
   There was no controversy over the $300 million for newly
democratic Nicaragua. But other congressional initiatives were
causing headaches at the White House.
   A fight appeared certain, for example, over language added by
Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., that would allow the District of
Columbia to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women.
   Bush vetoed other bills twice last year that contained similar
abortion language, and administration budget director Richard
Darman said it was ``virtually certain'' the president would do the
same thing again unless the provision is dropped or changed.
   After winning Senate approval, the bill still faces a
House-Senate conference to work out differences between competing
versions before it is sent to the White House.
   Among other congressional riders added to the bill were:
   _A directive that the Department of Veterans Affairs stick to
the schedule for building an addition to its medical center in
Huntington, W.Va., rather than delaying construction as the
department has proposed.
   _$7.8 million to monitor volcanic eruptions at Mount Redoubt,
near Anchorage, Alaska, the state of Sen. Ted Stevens, a Republican
member of the Appropriations Committee.
   _The transfer of a 112-foot Coast Guard ship, the Agile, from
Beaumont, Texas, to the government of American Samoa to provide
transportation among the Samoan islands.
   _$238 million to build an Army explosives plant in Louisiana,
the state of Democratic committee member J. Bennett Johnston. The
House had sought to eliminate money for the plant.
   _A special reduced interest rate for Israel for $400 million in
U.S. loan guarantees to build housing for Jewish immigrants from
the Soviet Union. The move, sponsored by Sens. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., and Robert Kasten, R-Wis., could save Israel more than $25
million in loan-servicing costs over the 30-year life of the loan.
   In both its House and Senate versions, the bill was being
largely financed through cuts or transfers from the Pentagon's 1990
budget. The Senate bill claimed $2.8 billion in defense savings, $1
billion more than the House.

   Ethnic dissension and mass defections of
junior officers threaten to undermine the Soviet military, private
U.S. analysts say in a view that strengthens the CIA downgrading of
any Soviet threat to the West.
   ``The Soviet military is not growing leaner and meaner and it's
not on the road to growing leaner and meaner,'' Stephen Meyer of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology told the House Armed
Services Committee on Wednesday.
   Meyer and John Hines, of the RAND Corp., provided a grim picture
of a Soviet military plagued by public criticism, limited support
from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and even a significant number
of troops unable to speak Russian.
   The testimony follows U.S. intelligence reports predicting
continuing instability of the broader Soviet economy despite
Gorbachev's efforts to institute reforms.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, a Soviet legislator said that if his
government fails to take immediate steps to fix the economy, the
system will collapse and spawn widespread discontent.
   Vladimir Tikhonov, an agricultural economist who is also a
member of his country's Congress of People's Deputies, told the
Joint Economic Committee that the Soviet economy is ``extremely
ill.''
   Last week's joint CIA-Defense Intelligence Agency report said
the Soviets cut military spending 4 percent to 5 percent last year,
strengthening the position of those in Congress calling for bigger
U.S. defense cuts in response to changes in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.
   Members of Congress, including Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman
of the House Armed Services Committee, point to the recent reports
and CIA Director William Webster's testimony as a clear argument
for further reductions in U.S. military spending.
   Aspin asked the analysts whether the Soviet military could
launch an offensive outside its borders.
   ``They would respond, but it would take a great deal of time, it
would be a relatively ineffective force and potentially one that I
think any serious commander would not want to take into offensive
operation,'' Hines replied.
   Problems for the military include the attitude of Gorbachev, who
despite pleas from military officials approved student deferments
from the armed forces.
   ``The Gorbachev regime has a deaf ear to the military,'' Meyer
said.
   The military leadership is alienated from Soviet society, blamed
for the war in Afghanistan and the widespread economic problems
that plague the country, he said.
   In addition, people in the military get paid less than the
industrial wage, work seven days a week and, according to recent
Soviet statistics, 170,000 officers and their families are without
housing.
   Complicating the military's problems is the division between
senior and junior officers. Many of the latter have sided with
civilian reformers and joined informal ethnic groups, Meyer said.
   About 40 percent of the Soviet military are non-Russians or
non-Slavics and between 10 percent and 30 percent of them do not
speak Russian, he said.
   In one instance, Hines said, a Soviet commander complained that
in his unit attached to a land-based nuclear missile project, only
two of the 40 Azerbaijanis spoke Russian.
   The Soviet Ministry of Defense has released figures showing 40
percent to 70 percent of disciplinary violence is tied to
nationalism.
   ``The result is a mass exodus of junior officers from the
military even under substantial economic loss to themselves,'' said
Meyer, who noted military personnel have to sign documents claiming
they are mentally deficient or criminals to gain their release.
   In addition, education standards have dropped for the military,
as shown by a sharp increase in the number of accidents and deaths
among troops using military equipment, Meyer said.

<HEAD>House Speaker Supports Bush on Response to Soviet Blockade of
Lithuania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he
supports President Bush's decision not to impose sanctions against
the Soviet Union for blockading Lithuania.
   ``It might be more difficult for Gorbachev to negotiate a
peaceful solution (if sanctions were imposed) because that might be
seen as yielding to United States pressure,'' Foley said.
   The Democrat made his remarks Wednesday in response to questions
following an address to the 104th annual convention of the American
Newspaper Publishers Association.
   Foley's speech to the publishers focused on the need to turn
from emphasis on defense to the crucial issues of education, health
care, the environment and the deficit.
   He faulted Bush for failing to use his immense public popularity
to impress on Americans the need to meet these domestic challenges.
   ``The president is presently popular,'' he said. ``But the
president needs to engage that popularity more and challenge the
country and the Congress.''
   He added, ``I understand the president's reluctance to address
the problem of the deficit without a relaxation of his position on
taxes.''
   He drew laughter and some applause when he paraphrased George
Bernard Shaw and said, ``There are two types of sins in American
politics. Some are committed by politicians who don't keep their
campaign promises. But some more mortal sins are committed by
politicians who keep their campaign promises.''
   He was referring to Bush's campaign promise not to impose new
taxes.
   Foley pinpointed education as the nation's greatest crisis.
   ``Our effectiveness will not be calibrated on how many missiles
we have and how many silos but how our primary classrooms are
performing,'' he said.
   Foley said U.S. students in primary and high schools
consistently perform ``12th to last'' in international scholastic
competitions.
   ``Higher education is not where the problem is,'' he said.
``Primary and secondary education is.''
   In response to a question, he said the imbalance of trade with
Japan is partially ``a problem of our own making,'' and he blamed
poor education for leading to poor productivity by American
companies seeking to compete with Japan.
   He said that even if Japan agreed to a totally open market, ``we
would still have a very substantial trade deficit with Japan.''

   ``Of Bright &amp; Blue Birds &amp; the Gala Sun'' is a
full-length dance that Paul Taylor choreographed for the Paul
Taylor Dance Company's 35th season.
   Program notes say it's an allegory.
   It's stunningly choreographed and danced, even for a viewer who
has to guess at the allegory part.
   The dance, performed for the first time on Wednesday at the City
Center, is Taylor's third full-evening work.
   The music, most of it melodic, was composed by Donald York. It's
often reminiscent of the first part of Copland's ``Appalachian
Spring''; sometimes it sounds like a movie score behind a scene of
spring sunshine.
   Elie Chaib stands at the top of two steps with reeds at each
side, at the beginning. Dancers _ there are 18 _ in light green,
khaki and tan _ enter and do an ebullient dance. The women wear
split skirts over leotards of the same color. A curtain falls and
dancing in front of it is charming, to lyrical music. When the
whole stage is seen again, dancers in more modern dress seem to be
in a disco, dancing to a jazzy beat.
   Then, for a long time, everybody dances as though demented. Arms
and legs flail fast; jumps are done with a grand twitch. Women
pursue men, kicking out.
   Act 1 ends on a calm note.
   In Act 2, people in front of a curtain are trying to get through
to people seen behind it. This may be today's generation reaching
back to the previous.
   In the next scene, dancers are in shiny leotards, which may
indicate the future. Now, the steps where Chaib stands seem a
throne where he observes his people dance.
   Later, as he dancers walk by twos between the reeds, we could be
seeing the portal to adult life. Act 2 also ends serenely.
   Last week, Taylor premiered a funny ballet, ``The Sorcerer's
Sofa,'' a takeoff on psychiatry. The couch, ``A Chaste Lounge,''
danced on her toes by Mary Cochran in quilted blue, holding a
matching bolster pillow, has more sense than the pyschiatrist.
   A timid young client, Thomas Patrick, lies down on the couch and
tells Christopher Gillis, in long gray beard, his problem.
   ``The Demon Within,'' Sandra Stone, in red with spikey red hair,
appears in the room. Instead of the psychiatrist exorcising her,
her ``Duplication,'' Francie Huber, appears.
   Then seven dancers called ``A Lot More Duplications'' arrive.
The couch bops the psychiatrist, lies down on the patient and is
ready to take over.
   The demons do a kick line, but their days are numbered.
   The company will be at the City Center through May 13.

<TEXT>
   The census tries to overcome a deluge of
criticism today, returning to its roots to count Americans door to
door.
   Workers will hit the streets in more than 100 cities, seeking to
find and count the more than one in three households that hasn't
been heard from yet.
   The count got under way in March with the mailing of more than
95 million questionnaires.
   But mistakes in addressing meant that millions of people failed
to get forms, and millions more haven't mailed theirs back. The
problems, including large apartment buildings and whole blocks and
small towns seemingly overlooked, have drawn heavy criticism for
the Census Bureau.
   Now things are moving into the next stage, as census workers,
known as enumerators, begin marching door to door.
   In the last few decades the system of mailing out census
questionnaires and asking people to send them back has become
common practice. It replaced the traditional, but labor-intensive
process of having someone visit every home.
   Now, the door-to-door count is reserved only for sparsely
populated areas and for follow-up on people who don't answer by
mail.
   Original plans had anticipated that about 70 percent of
households would mail back their forms. So far, only 63 percent
have responded and the low return rate means more hiring and more
costs.
   Originally expected to cost $1.3 billion this year, the price of
counting Americans could well increase by $150 million or more,
according to congressional sources.
   In addition to problems in the mail portion of the count, a
coalition of cities and interest groups has filed suit against the
Census Bureau, contending that minorities are being undercounted
and seeking to force a statistical adjustment of the final figures.
   The work getting under way today covers more than 100
metropolitan areas nationwide, trying to track down people who
either didn't get a census form or failed to mail theirs back.
   Individual counting expands to an additional 300 smaller
communities on May 3, Census officials report.
   In rural areas that were not included in the mail portion of the
count, personal visits by census takers have been going on since
March.
   The official workers can be identified by their red, white and
blue identification badges and satchels, the Census Bureau reported.
   Although the house-to-house count is now starting, government
officials continue to encourage Americans to mail back forms if
they have not done so.
   Counting Americans on their doorsteps will continue at least
through June, and longer if needed, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Stone-faced Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom Landry was
the closest thing to the Sphinx ever seen in Giants Stadium _ until
now.
   A 55-foot replica of the Egyptian wonder is coming to New Jersey
in June for a spectacular $7 million production of the opera
``Aida.''
   While most operas aren't over 'til the fat lady sings, this one
won't be done until 1,200 cast members, a 100-piece orchestra, a
menagerie of exotic animals and the eight-ton Sphinx are paraded
through Giants Stadium for two nights.
   Promoters are hoping for 39,000 people each night for the June
1-2 shows, not including Jimmy Hoffa, the ex-Teamsters boss
allegedly buried in one end zone.
   The promoters are also aware that a stadium off the New Jersey
Turnpike, deep in the heart of Bruce Springsteen country, is not
the usual spot for a musical work that premiered 119 years ago in
Cairo.
   So they're going for the hard sell, sending costumed Egyptian
wannabes to shopping malls in an effort to plug the show. Ads in
the local media proclaim ``THINK SPHINX,'' while ad copy trumpets
``The Opera Spectacular.''
   Twenty New Jersey malls were targeted for the blitz, with folks
dressed as Aida, Radames, Egyptian soldiers and high priests
spreading out from a midtown Manhattan motel and heading into the
Garden State.
   Giants Stadium is the latest stop for the opera, which is billed
as the biggest production of any opera, ever. ``Aida'' has played
in Montreal, Sydney, Melbourne, Vancouver, Tokyo and Toronto in the
past two years. In Japan, 102,000 people attended.
   But ``Aida'' is more than an opera, said Tony Attanasio, who has
been training the mall roamers. Verdi wrote his grand opera with
jugglers, animals and dancers, designed for grand-scale popular
entertainment, the publicist said.
   Maestro Giuseppe Raffa, who is directing the production, said
``opera is for the people'' rather than the privileged few.
Attanasio said auditions for the opera's 500 extras bear the
maestro out.
   ``In Australia, we had the president of the government, the
president of the largest company, two Olympic medal winners.
Everybody tried out. Nobody has special privilege,'' Attanasio said.
   ``Everybody has in the back of his head the dream of being in
show business once in his life.''
   Casting for many of the Giants Stadium extras has already been
held at Sleepy Hollow High School in Tarrytown, N.Y. Everyone
chosen gets two $35 seats _ tickets also are sold at $50 and $75 _
a sweatshirt and an invite to the cast party.
   A May 5 audition for 200 soldiers will be held in Central Park.
   Raffa, 38, got the idea for the traveling spectacular after
watching Italian film director Mauro Bolognini direct ``Aida'' in
Giza, Egypt, with the real Sphinx and Pyramids in the background.
   The 1987 show inspired him to put together the financing and
hire Bolognini, the set producer and the costume designer.
   The traveling ``Aida'' had to build sand dunes, Pyramids, the
Nile and a Sphinx. They went the real thing one better, putting
motors and drivers inside the 55-foot, eight-ton replica Sphinx and
letting it split and show its profile on each side of the stage
during the Triumphal Entry scene.
   After Giants Stadium, ``Aida'' will play the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum June 29 and 30, San Francisco in mid-July and
possibly Washington, D.C., in September. Grace Bumbry of the United
States will sing Aida, Bruno Sebastian of Italy will sing Radames
and Ruza Baldani of Yugoslavia will sing Amneris.
   A giant screen on each side of the stage will show closeups and
the words in English. A $1 million amplification system has been
built in Holland.
   But the ``Aida'' production will not bring the only Sphinx to
Giants Stadium this summer. The rock band Kiss is coming to town in
the summer, and their stage show will feature a towering version of
the Egyptian monument too _ one with an attitude, promised Kiss
vocalist Paul Stanley.
   ``Ours is going to talk, and it hates opera,'' Stanley said.

<HEAD>Congressional Committee Hails Tilt-Rotor Aircraft in Landing at
Capitol</HEAD>

   An experimental aircraft the Pentagon wants to
abandon is being touted as the passenger plane of the future.
   ``Welcome to the dawn of a new age in aviation,'' said House
aviation subcommittee chairman Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., after
he arranged for a XV-15 tilt-rotor aircraft to swoop down and land
alongside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, sending spectators
scurrying up the steps.
   The Defense Department has spent $2 billion to develop the XV-15
and its successor, the V-22 Osprey, for military use. But Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney wants to end funding in favor of conventional
helicopter development.
   The XV-15 and the Osprey land like helicopters but fly at up to
340 mph as fixed-wing airplanes _ much faster than a helicopter.
Large rotors on the ends of the wings tilt up for vertical flight
and rotate forward for the long haul.
   Two XV-15s were made. Pentagon contracts call for six Ospreys,
two of which have been delivered by a partnership between Bell
Helicopter Textron Inc. and Boeing Helicopter.
   Oberstar told his Public Works subcommittee it took everything
but a papal decree to allow the 12-year-old plane landing rights at
the Capitol. Looking like a giant insect out of a science fiction
movie, the XV-15 went through a series of maneuvers a few yards
from the Capitol.
   ``This is the most significant contribution to civilian aviation
since the dawn of the jet age,'' Oberstar told reporters on the
Capitol lawn.
   Both Democratic and Republican subcommittee members blasted the
fact that the Pentagon wants to stop funding the Osprey.
   The Marines sought the tilt-rotor for use as an assault
transport to carry 24 troops or weapons and supplies from ship to
beachhead in amphibious landings. But the Defense Department argues
that helicopters already are doing the job and money for the Osprey
can be better used elsewhere in an era of budget cuts.
   Committee members showed nearly unanimous support for
development of the Osprey as a passenger plane to serve
space-starved cities and rural communities without conventional
airports. They also praised its potential for use in rescues, drug
interdiction and oil spill cleanup.
   Of 14 committee members at the hearing, only Rep. John J.
Duncan, R-Tenn., raised a negative note, asking why, if the plane
has such great potential, isn't private industry funding its
development.
   Supporters said it often is necessary for expensive new aircraft
to begin as military hardware.
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, a liberal Democrat from Oregon, brought
applause at the hearing when he said, ``I can count on less than
one hand the new military weapons systems I will support, but this
is one of them.''
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., carrying a boxed plastic model of the
plane, said the Japanese and Europeans will build a similar
aircraft and sell it to U.S. airlines if the United States doesn't
move ahead with the technology.
   He noted that his plastic version was made in Korea and said,
``Let the Koreans and the Japanese build the model. We'll build the
real thing.''
   Joseph Del Balzo, FAA systems development chief, said the
Japanese are working on a tilt-wing aircraft, possibly to be built
in Texas, but likely would be interested in taking up the
tilt-rotor technology if the United States abandons it.
   A group of European countries also is working on a project to
build a similar plane, he said, and Soviet aviation officials have
shown some interest.

   President Bush can discontinue twice-daily
treatment with eye drops even though he has a mild form of
glaucoma, the White House says after getting a second opinion on
the president's eyes.
   Dr. Burton Lee, the White House physician, made the announcement
after Bush was examined by two glaucoma specialists during an
hour-long visit to Bethesda Naval Medical Center on Wednesday.
   Lee said the examination confirmed the finding, made by other
doctors during Bush's annual checkup at the hospital April 12, that
the president has ``one type of early glaucoma.''
   ``Extensive testing of the eye including detailed photographs
once again revealed no abnormalities and no visual loss,'' the
White House doctor said. ``It was decided to stop the Betagan eye
drops and follow him closely for now, on no treatment.''
   After the physical exam, Bush began using the medicine every 12
hours. His doctors said he would need to take it for the rest of
his life.
   The examination Wednesday was conducted by Dr. Richard Brubaker
of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and Dr. Harry Quigley of
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
   ``It was the experts' opinion that the medication was not
warranted,'' said Stephen Hart, a deputy White House press
secretary. He said Bush had suffered no side effects from the
medication.
   Hart said the decision to take the president off the medication
was ``just simply a difference of opinion'' with the other doctors.
``There is no progression or regression'' in the glaucoma, he said.
``There is no change in his eyes.''
   Bush wore dark glasses as he emerged from the hospital, and
flashed a thumbs-up sign to reporters as he was driven past them in
his limousine.
   Lee's statement said, ``The physical findings were reviewed by
the consultants and the diagnosis of exfoliation syndrome was
confirmed with slightly increased intra-ocular pressure noted again
in the left eye, one type of early glaucoma.''
   The April 12 examination was conducted by Lee, assisted by
several staff doctors at Bethesda, including Capt. Ralph Sawyer, an
ophthalmologist.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., says he resents Bush
administration criticism of his call for a multi-year commodities
support program in the 1990 farm bill.
   ``We have followed the administration's guidelines to develop a
specific piece of legislation,'' Kerrey said Wednesday.
   Despite his junior status, Kerrey has taken the lead in the
Senate Agriculture Committee on the commodities section of the farm
bill, but finds himself at odds with another Nebraskan, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   President Bush on Tuesday dismissed Kerrey's contention that a
farm crisis could occur if the government doesn't provide $12
billion annually for five years to support program crops _ wheat,
corn, rice, soybeans and cotton.
   Yeutter, who appeared with Bush at a convention of farm
journalists, said Congress should realize that besides subsidies,
``there's a market out there'' that can support farmers.
   ``I really resent the agriculture secretary's continued
statements to the public that we don't understand the market's out
there,'' said Kerrey. ``I'm alarmed at the rhetoric that's coming
back from the administration.''
   The administration has said that no more than $10.2 billion
should be spent on the commodities programs in fiscal 1991 and the
government should wait for the outcome of international trade talks
before determining levels for the next four years of the farm bill.
   But Kerrey said a well-financed farm program will save the
government money in the long run.
   ``I fully confess that part of my concern is based on having
gone through this while I was governor,'' said Kerrey, who served
as Nebraska's chief executive from 1982-86.
   ``I remember very vividly what can happen when the government
says we are going to put together a farm bill based on budget
only,'' he said in reference to cuts devised by David Stockman, who
was President Reagan's budget director in the first years of that
administration.
   ``It ended up being most expensive and destructive,'' Kerrey
said. ``If you only keep the budget number down and don't
understand that the program has a purpose,'' there is trouble.
   ``We understand there is limitation on what we can spend,'' he
said. ``We have attempted to do that.''
   The Senate committee has not acted on Kerrey's bill, although
six of the 19 members are co-sponsors.
   In the House, a new spending package announced last week by
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., would hold
spending on commodity programs to $9.8 billion in the next fiscal
year.
   The House Agriculture subcommittee working on the commodities
section of the farm bill has been trying for weeks to come up with
a plan that satisfies budget writers.

<HEAD>Higher Foreign Sugar Quota Should Help Cut US Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision to let Nicaragua
sell its sugar to the United States will aid that country's
economy, but _ more importantly to food makers _ it also will help
cut sugar prices here.
   ``The United States badly needed the sugar,'' Ken Arnold of the
Sweetener Users Association said Wednesday after the administration
announced it would buy more sugar from 40 countries, including
Nicaragua for the first time since 1985.
   U.S. manufacturers of sweets have been pressuring the Bush
administration to open the doors to more foreign sugar because a
domestic shortage was causing prices to rise.
   ``The Sweetener Users Association is pleased that USDA raised
the quota level by the amount we had requested,'' said Thomas
Hammer, president of the association.
   The announcement from the Agriculture Department coincided with
Vice President Dan Quayle's visit to Nicaragua for the transfer of
power from the Sandinistas to the new president, Violeta Chamorro.
   Luther Markwart, chairman of the American Sugar Alliance, said
the only way the administration could give Nicaragua back its quota
was to increase the total amount allowed into the United States
from other countries.
   ``There was no way they could take quotas away from other
countries,'' he said. ``The administration does use the sugar
program as foreign policy.''
   Markwart, who represents American sugar cane and sugar beet
producers, said consumers may see sugar prices at the supermarket
drop a penny or two as a result of the quota increases.
   The only countries on USDA's list that were not told they could
increase sales in the United States were El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Honduras, which were given most of Nicaragua's quota in 1983
when the Reagan administration began cutting back on trade with
Managua.
   The action Wednesday allows Nicaragua to export 54,328 metric
tons of sugar to the United States, making it the tenth-largest
foreign supplier.
   The highest quotas go to the Dominican Republic at 460,997 tons;
the Philippines at 413,850; Brazil, 379,798; and Australia, 217,401.
   About 17 percent of the sugar used in the United States comes
from other countries.
   This is the fourth time in the past eight months that USDA has
increased the sugar import quota level in response to market
conditions. Previous increases were made on Sept. 12, Nov. 24 and
Jan. 16.
   Arnold said the government uses the foreign quotas as a
``spigot'' that it turns on and off to stabilize sugar prices.
   If there is a shortage in domestic production, the government
increases the flow of foreign sugar to keep prices from getting too
high. If there is an oversupply, the government can limit quotas.
   ``What we pay attention to specifically are the raw prices of
sugar,'' said Arnold. ``Market stabilization price is the price the
government wants the price of sugar to be at.
   ``The price of sugar has been running a couple cents above the
market stabilization price. That's the first thing that sets
sweetener users off that something is wrong here.
   ``Then the other thing we look at is wholesale refined prices.
Those prices had been rising rather dramatically over the last

<HEAD>AIDS Victim's Mother Lobbies for Spending Bill</HEAD>

   Two weeks after a crowd of 1,500 attended AIDS
victim Ryan White's funeral in Indianapolis, his mother was
fighting for his memory just as she had fought for his right to be
treated like any other child.
   ``I think it's made a big impact, me being here,'' Jeanne White,
42, said Wednesday after a round of meetings with senators to drum
up more sponsors for an emergency bill providing $600 million to
fight AIDS.
   ``I think it's different to have something on a piece of paper
than to meet the people in real life and to see the tragedy and
everything this disease has,'' she said in an interview.
   Mrs. White was continuing her round of quickly scheduled
meetings today. The fresh memory of her son's lingering illness
made it possible for her to gain appointments that others must wait
for weeks to obtain.
   Keeping busy has helped ease the grief for Mrs. White, whose
son's death called attention to the indiscriminate way in which
AIDS strikes. Ryan was a hemophiliac who contracted the fatal
disease through contaminated blood products when he was 13. He was
18 when he died April 8.
   The disease is spread through sexual intercourse, blood
transfusions, and cuts or punctures with infected objects,
including hypodermic needles and scalpels. Infected women can pass
the disease along to their unborn children.
   The disease has struck mostly homosexual men and intravenous
drug users, but Mrs. White said any family is vulnerable to the
tragedy.
   ``It can be your brother, your sister, your mother, your
father,'' she said. ``It could be a loved one, a friend. It's
eventually going to hit everybody.''
   ``I think AIDS is here to stay,'' she said. ``I think that,
because we would all have to quit having sex completely. I think
that's the main issue.
   The bill Mrs. White is lobbying for was passed 16-0 on April 4
by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. Ryan was in the
hospital in critical condition at the time, and the senators
dedicated the bill to him.
   The bill, co-sponsored by Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would provide $600 million a year for the next
two years in emergency assistance.
   Ryan had hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime, and was
``just very disappointed'' that so few resources were devoted to
fighting the disease, Mrs. White said.
   Although refraining from direct criticism of the Reagan and Bush
administrations, she said:
   ``Ryan met Ronald and Nancy Reagan a week before he died, and I
felt like Ryan made a very emotional impact on them. And I think
had they maybe met him four years ago or three years ago, I think
they would have related more to the issue of AIDS. It seems there
wasn't anybody who met Ryan who didn't love him.''
   Among those are the celebrities such as pop singers Elton John
and Michael Jackson, who had befriended Ryan years before attending
his funeral. She said television star Phil Donahue and his wife,
actress Marlo Thomas, invited Mrs. White to their house after the
funeral for a few days' respite.
   ``None of them was just a one-time deal,'' she said. ``Nobody
did it just for attention or publicity.''

<HEAD>Kohl's Leading Contender Stabbed In Neck, In Serious Condition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Social Democrats' candidate for
chancellor was in serious condition today after a woman stabbed him
in the neck during a campaign rally with a knife hidden in a
bouquet of flowers, officials said.
   It was unclear whether 46-year-old Oskar Lafontaine, the popular
governor of Saarland state and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's leading
challenger, will be able to lead his left-of-center party in the
campaign for Dec. 2 national elections.
   Interior Ministry officials said the stabbing severed a neck
artery and doctores at the hospital where Lafontaine was being
treated said he lost large amounts of blood.
   Lafontaine was attacked near the close of the Cologne rally at
about 9 p.m Wednesday by a black-haired woman in a white dress who
approached him on the dais seeking his autograph, witnesses and
officials said.
   The woman stabbed the politician as he was about to sign a
poetry album she presented him, police said. The ZDF television
network said the knife had been concealed in the flowers.
   Cologne police identified the woman as Adelheid Streidel, 42,
from the town of Bad Neuenahr, southwest of Bonn.
   The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor's
Office said there was no evidence the woman had a ``terrorist
background.''
   Today's editions of the Cologne-based tabloid, Express, said the
woman was a doctor's assistant who suffered from mental disorders.
The newspaper quoted neighbors as saying she was a divorcee who had
asked for weapons several times to defend herself against men she
believed were following her.
   The ARD television network showed the Social Democrat politician
lying on the floor as blood poured from his neck, with several
people crowded around him trying to administer first aid.
   The stabbing suspect was shown sitting impassively as a throng
of police men screamed at her ``Who are you? Who are you? Tell us
your name! Say it!''
   The woman said nothing and was then hustled by police out of the
Stadthalle auditorium in suburban Muelheim where about 2,000 people
had gathered for the rally.
   Lafontaine was rushed by helicopter to the University Clinic in
the Cologne suburb of Lindenthal, where he was listed in serious
condition early today.
   The politician is an unrelenting critic of Kohl and has strongly
opposed quick reunification of the two Germanys, advocating a more
gradual approach.
   In Paris for a West German-French summit, Kohl said the attack
has ``deeply shaken me. At this hour one can only hope that Oskar
Lafontaine survives.'' The statement was released by Kohl's office
in Bonn.
   Lafontaine is known for making bold and brash political
statments and delighted in his role as a political gadfly. He is
divorced and his active social life has received prominence in West
Germany's tabloid press.
   The candidate's most recent liaison is with a Frankfurt
hotelier's daughter whose dyed blond punk-style haircut delighted
news photographers.
   The outspoken politician, whose party trounced Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union in state elections in January, has been considered
a tough opponent for the December national elections.
   Lafontaine, a party activist at age 21, became mayor 11 years
later of Saarbruecken, capital of tiny Saarland state, which
borders France.
   In 1987, he became deputy chairman of the Social Democrats
despite opposition from the party's conservative wing, headed by
former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
   He strongly opposed plans under Schmidt's government in the late
1970s to station U.S. medium-range nuclear weapons in West Germany.

   Consumer advocates, attorneys and journalists
say court agreements that allow companies to keep information about
potential hazards involving their products secret are endangering
lives and public safety.
   However, corporate lawyers argue that such arrangements are a
legitimate part of the civil justice system, offer an alternative
to lengthy court battles and help protect trade secrets of U.S.
businesses and American competitiveness.
   ``Secrecy buries critical facts ... and the public good is
ignored and damaged,'' Russ Herman, president of the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America, said Wednesday at a conference on secrecy
sponsored by his group.
   Information discovered during product liability litigation
``ought to be made available to the public so the danger isn't
repeated over and over again,'' he added.
   In many instances that includes ``documents and decisions
involving unsafe products, dangerous drugs, toxic wastes _ all with
potentially devastating effect on people unaware of the danger,''
said Paul McMasters, deputy editorial director of USA Today.
   McMaster heads the freedom of information committee of the
Society of Professional Journalists, cosponsor of the conference.
   Protective orders, confidentiality agreements or court sealing
of files in product liability cases prohibit lawsuit participants
from distributing any of the information obtained, limit what can
be share with others not involved in the lawsuit or make all
records in a case unavailable.
   One corporate defense attorney said that opening court records
could violate privacy by revealing sensitive information about
businesses or individuals.
   ``If you can summons my medical records from my doctor, my diary
from my psychiatrist or records of design from a company ...
privacy goes out the window,'' said James Morris III, a Virginia
lawyer.
   Opponents to secrecy should not be allowed to use the court
system to disseminate information that might not otherwise be
available, Morris said.
   U.S. businesses are at a competitive disadvantage because
international agreements don't force foreign companies to release
the same extensive information, he added.
   ``Foreign corporations are subject to the same rules as American
corporations in this country,'' countered Eugene I. Pavalon, a
Chicago trial lawyer.
   ``For children, keeping secrets is a game ... but for public
health and safety secrets can be nasty,'' said Devra Davis, a
toxicologist at the National Academy of Sciences.
   ``The practice of secrecy in the courts can result in a failure
to tell the public about proven hazards _ endangering lives,
perverting science and ultimately undermining democracy itself,''
she said.
   Davis said that in January 1983, she suffered a nearly fatal
allergic reaction to the prescription painkiller Zomax, which was
eventually withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer.
   Later, she said, she discovered the manufacturer, doctors and
other patients had known of the possible severe reaction but the
information was not available because of secrecy agreements
obtained in product liability case settlements by McNeil
Pharmaceutical, the drug manufacturer.
   Davis said had she known about the possible reaction she would
not have taken the drug.
   The opponents said they didn't oppose secrecy in all instances.
Most said companies' trade secrets should be protected and in
personal cases, such as divorce and some criminal cases, some
information should not be available to the general public.

<TEXT>
   The inauguration of Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro was hardly a solemn and decorous affair of state. The new
president made her entrance in a hail of water balloons and her
predecessor was pelted with watermelon rinds.
   Mrs. Chamorro tried to get off to a running start in her
inaugural speech Wednesday, but her government ran into trouble
even before she donned the presidential sash in the first
democratic transfer of power in Nicaraguan history.
   She declared a general amnesty and proclaimed an end to the
despised military draft, the dawn of peace and the rebirth of a
free market economy.
   But she also said Gen. Humberto Ortega, one of the architects of
the leftist Sandinista state that her supporters thought they had
ousted in the Feb. 25 election, would remain in command of the
armed forces.
   Key groups within her conservative United National Opposition
rebelled, including two people who had agreed to serve in the
Cabinet. The nation also braced for the unraveling of an accord on
disbanding the Contra rebels by June 10.
   About 500 rebels in northern Nicaragua simply laughed when the
top Contra commander, Israel Galeano, asked if they were ready to
hand over their weapons to waiting U.N. peacekeeping troops.
   ``Nobody gives up his gun,'' they said.
   And as UNO supporters publicly celebrated victory for the first
time since the election, the cry was as loud and clear as the
crackle of the fireworks overhead and as insistent as the tropical
music to which they danced in the capital's main plaza: ``Humberto
Should Go!''
   Mrs. Chamorro had tried to soften the blow by saying she'd serve
as defense minister, the post Ortega held until the change of
government.
   She said she chose her Cabinet with national reconciliation in
mind. But neither Gilberto Cuadra or Jaime Cuadra, who had been
chosen for Cabinet posts, could reconcile themselves to serving in
a government that included Ortega.
   ``I wouldn't like to think that she feels that in her moment of
greatest need, I'm not there; but I had warned her,'' Jaime Cuadra
told The Associated Press.
   He is a coffee farmer and rancher who was to have been
agriculture minister.
   Gilberto Cuadra, president of the nation's most important
business group and a leader of the private sector that is the
foundation of Mrs. Chamorro's support, was to have been minister of
construction and transport.
   The two Cuadras, who are not related, refused the posts on the
eve of the inauguration after being informed Mrs. Chamorro was
keeping Ortega, a move the UNO political council opposed and
something she publicly said she would not do.
   Until a few days ago, Ortega, the brother of former President
Daniel Ortega, was one of the nine members of the Sandinista
national directorate.
   He was the revolution's chief military strategist, oversaw the
military buildup that created Central America's largest armed force
and led the Sandinista army through nine years of war against the
U.S.-backed Contras.
   Control of the armed forces is regarded as critical to Mrs.
Chamorro's ability to govern, and retaining Ortega puts that
control in doubt.
   She insisted in her inaugural speech that she _ not Ortega _
would call the shots. He was under orders, she said, to cut the
budget-draining military and retrieve weapons from the thousands of
civilians the Sandinistas have armed.
   ``We have to melt down our arms and sell the metal to buy
machinery for agriculture and industry,'' she said.
   Both the army and the police were party organs under the
Sandinistas and their loyalty is a question mark despite an accord
saying they would be depoliticized.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez has loaned Mrs.
Chamorro a commando team to handle her security rather than leave
it in local hands.
   The Sandinistas did not relinquish power gracefully.
   Sandinista rowdies pelted the 60-year-old widow and her escorts
with water-filled plastic bags as she entered the national baseball
stadium for the inaugural ceremony.
   When outgong President Ortega entered the stadium on foot, UNO
partisans pelted him with watermelon rinds and blue-and-white UNO
flags, and police quickly charged into the stands.
   Thousands of Sandinistas in the stands at the stadium formed a
gauntlet that presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers and
ambassadors had to run.
   Representatives of nations deemed friends of the Sandinistas,
such as Cuba and the Soviet Union, were greeted with cheers and
waves of red-and-black Sandinista party flags.
   Envoys of nations unpopular with the Sandinistas entered to
catcalls, boos and insults.
   ``Killer, killer, killer, killer,'' the crowd chanted when El
Salvador's rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, went by.
   Vice President Dan Quayle got the same greeting as well as
shouts of ``Son of a bitch, go home'' and ``Here, there, the
Yankees will die.''
   Quayle was supportive of Mrs. Chamorro's controversial decision
to retain Ortega.
   ``It shows she is trying to reconcile the differences in her
country,'' he told reporters.

   A power station exploded Wednesday night,
blacking out downtown Toronto and surrounding areas, causing
traffic chaos and sending thousands of people into the streets.
   It took two to three hours to restore power in many areas, and
some looting was reported.
   The blackout forced management at the Eaton Centre to close down
and evacuate the huge shopping mall, but police said shops had been
broken into.
   ``Groups of people have grabbed clothing out of stores,'' said
police Staff Sgt. Lou Villani.
   He said off-duty officers were asked to report in to help patrol
the downtown area.
   One radio report said 90,000 homes and 10,000 businesses were
affected by the power outage, which Ontario Hydro said began at
about 8:10 p.m. EDT and lasted about two hours in much of downtown.
In some sections of the city center, power continued to be out past
11 p.m. EDT.
   Subway trains ran slowly, the platforms lighted with emergency
lights.
   Ontario Hydro spokesman Bill Friday said the power outage began
after an explosion and fire at a transformer station. He said the
station was shut down and evacuated.
   The spokesman blamed the explosion on equipment failure.
   Stores and restaurants downtown were plunged into darkness, and
the streets filled up with rubberneckers.
   Traffic lights were knocked out. Pedestrians picked their way
across congested streets.
   The emergency department at St. Michael's hospital was blacked
out for more than 1{ hours, but patients and ambulances were
redirected to other hospitals not affected and no one was in
danger, spokeswoman Leanna Wilson said.
   She said the rest of hospital had power from an emergency backup
system.
   Television stations were knocked off the air, but programming
flickered back on and off.
   Police said most elevators had enough emergency power to get
people to the ground.
   But a police spokesman reported: ``All traffic control signals
are out. We've put every available officer to try and control
traffic and other problems that go with blackouts.''
   A clerk at a store in the Eaton Centre, Cary Legree, said
security people quickly cleared out the mall after the blackout
began, adding:
   ``Some idiot went running through the store saying: `It's a
bomb' but otherwise it was cool. Thank God it was not busy.''

   American women see most men as lecherous,
egotistical slobs. And they don't like mother-in-law jokes, either,
a survey says.
   The national poll, released Wednesday, found increasing numbers
of women expressing annoyance at sexism and describing men as
manipulative, oversexed and mean. It compared responses to
identical questions asked 20 years ago.
   In 1970, for example, two-thirds of the women surveyed agreed
that ``most men are basically kind, gentle and thoughtful.'' In the
new poll, only half of the women interviewed agreed with that
statement.
   Prurience also took a pounding. Fifty-four percent of the women
agreed that ``most men look at a woman and immediately think how it
would be to go to bed with her.'' That was up from 41 percent who
agreed in 1970.
   Majorities in the new poll, conducted by the Roper Organization,
also rated men negatively on their egos and domesticity. Sizable
minorities went further: Forty-two percent called men ``basically
selfish and self-centered.''
   The reason? ``Women's growing dissatisfaction with men is
undoubtedly derived from their own rising expectations,'' the
pollsters reported. ```The more independent women of today expect
more from men.''
   The poll, financed by Philip Morris USA in the name of its
Virginia Slims cigarettes, was conducted July 22 through Aug. 12 by
personal interviews with a random sample of 3,000 women. The margin
of error was 2 points.
   Respondents expressed greater awareness of discrimination
against women than they did 20 years ago. But they also said
overwhelmingly that women have made progress in job opportunities,
fair pay and political leadership.
   Six in 10 of the women who work full time said juggling jobs and
families puts them under ``a lot of stress,'' and nearly as many
said they felt guilty about time they spend at work and away from
their families.
   ``Their frustration comes out of trying to be superwomen,'' said
Ellen Merlo, a Philip Morris vice president. ``Women are handling
so many aspects of life _ trying to achieve success in careers,
wanting to be a wife and a mother, run a home, and do it all well.
It's a lot for anyone to handle.''
   Indeed, the second-greatest cause of resentment in respondents'
lives was their mates' failure to help with household duties, cited
by 52 percent. Only money was a greater cause of woe.
   ``As women contribute more to family income, they expect a more
equitable division of the household responsibilities in return,''
the poll report said. ``Women indicate that men are failing to live
up to this ideal, and that their failure is a major source of
irritation.''
   Diapers and dishes are by no means the sole problem: Many women
expressed negative views of male attitudes as well as behavior.
   Among the findings:
   _Fifty-eight percent of the women agreed that ``most men think
only their own opinions about the world are important,'' up from 50
percent in 1970.
   _Given the statement, ``Most men find it necessary for their
egos to keep women down,'' 55 percent agreed, up from 49 percent 20
years ago.
   _Fifty-three percent agreed that ``most men are interested in
their work and life outside the home and don't pay much attention
to things going on at home.'' That was up from 39 percent in 1970.
   The poll found similar increases in sensitivity to sexism.
Fifty-three percent said they were annoyed by ``jokes about women
drivers, mothers-in-law or dumb blondes,'' up from 32 percent in
1970. Sixty-one percent were annoyed by pictures of nude women in
men's magazines, up from 43 percent.
   Eighty percent resented a woman being looked upon ``as sex
symbol instead of as having sense in her head,'' up from 66 percent
in 1970. And 53 percent were annoyed by men referring to them as a
``girl'' rather than a ``woman,'' up from 31 percent.
   The poll results indicated that men must have some redeeming
factors, however. Asked their idea of the best kind of life, more
than nine in 10 of the women named marriage.

   Gentleman cowboy George Strait brought the
night's big prize home at the Academy of Country Music Awards, but
fellow Texan Clint Black, an ironworker with a hot first record,
came away with the most trophies.
   The only other multiple winner during Wednesday's 25th
anniversary awards show on NBC was Kathy Mattea, voted top female
vocalist and song of the year winner for ``Where've You Been.''
   But the night belonged to Black.
   ``It feels very emotional. It feels great. It's wonderful. It's
just a big thrill. It's hard to describe,'' said Black, whose first
single, ``A Better Man,'' earned him single record of the year
honors.
   Black also took home top male vocalist, top new male vocalist
and album of the year trophies.
   Strait, who has been named top male vocalist three times and
earned best album honors once, was his unemotional, straight-faced
self after accepting entertainer of the year honors.
   ``I thought I had as good a shot as anybody to win. I got out
there and worked as hard as anybody else. To be chosen entertainer
of the year is very special,'' he said.
   The 4-year-old Nashville band Restless Heart won best group,
while Mary Chapin Carpenter was voted new female vocalist. The
Judds _ Naomi Judd and daughter Wynona _ won a sixth consecutive
vocal duet trophy.
   Top new group honors went to Kentucky Headhunters, a wild band
of longhairs complete with leather and suspenders.
   Asked if anyone had discussed the group's image, Headhunter
Richard Young said, ``Nobody ever asked us to change anything. We
just be ourselves. What you see is what you have. We are on a
campaign for ugly people ... but we're very nice.''
   Three-time entertainer of the year Hank Williams Jr. was the
sentimental favorite going into the awards show because of
nominations he shared with his legendary father for ``There's a
Tear in My Beer,'' a duet the younger Williams made by singing
along to an old recording by his father, who died in 1953.
   Williams went home with one trophy _ video of the year for the
song _ despite nominations in five categories. But Williams heaped
on the emotion during his acceptance speech by reading a letter to
his father.
   ``Dear Daddy, we finally got to sing together and you left me
such a big hit. `There's a Tear in My Beer'' was one of the biggest
selling records around here in several years. `Hey Good Lookin.'
`I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.' `Your Cheating Heart.' And now after
all this time you're still up there on the charts. And there's
another place you'll always be and that's right here in all our
hearts. From all your fans and me.''
   The big surprise was Black, 28, who has performed in Houston
nightclubs with his brother since he was 15. ``A Better Man,''
describing the end of an affair that left him a better man, was his
first single, debuting last spring.
   ``It's very special to me because it's a tribute to someone very
special to me _ a girlfriend of many years,'' Black said backstage.
   The winning song ``Where've You Been'' was also a deeply
personal work, especially for Jon Vezner, Miss Mattea's husband.
The song, co-written by Vezner and Don Henry, is about a wife who
questions her husband's whereabouts as a young bride and then as a
dying hospital patient.
   ``It was basically a true story about my grandparents,'' said
Vezner. ``We try to write songs that come from our hearts.''
   The academy's 2,500 members voted for the winners except for the
video award, which is decided by a vote of the academy's Board of
Directors.

<HEAD>Environmental Group Complains About New York Reactor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An environmental group says the Energy
Department is planning to install a prototype of a more powerful
submarine reactor at an upstate New York laboratory.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council disclosed the plans, which
it said it learned about through declassified records of
congressional hearings, and complained Wednesday that the
government is going ahead without studying the impact on the
environment.
   The council said a prototype of the ``Advanced Fleet Reactor''
would be installed at the Kesselring site of the department's
Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory near Albany and Schenectady, N.Y.
   The department has argued a new environmental impact statement
is not required because one was performed for the site in 1972 for
the reactor used to power the Trident submarines, said NRDC, which
was joined in its statement by a local group, the Knolls Action
Project.
   Three department spokesman said Wednesday night they were not
familiar enough with the issue to comment.
   The New York Times reported in Thursday editions that the
department said the core of the new reactor will be tested, not the
whole reactor.
   The core contains the enriched uranium fuel, support elements
and control rods that govern the nuclear reaction by absorbing
neutrons. It will be inserted in an existing reactor during the
next two years, according to the department's statement.
   ``No commercial utility could get away with building a new
reactor in the 1990s based on an almost 20-year-old EIS on a
different reactor,'' said Dan W. Reicher, a staff attorney for NRDC.
   The Advanced Fleet Reactor has been under development for
several years. It is designed to power the Seawolf class of attack
submarines when they are built in the mid-1990s.
   In budget documents submitted to Congress earlier this year, the
department said the new reactor would ``encompass long-term
developments now coming to fruition and will deliver more power,
more quietly, than any previous submarine reactor _ and will do so
without a commensurate increase in size or weight.''
   The department quoted declassified testimony from 1988 as saying
the Advanced Fleet Reactor is of the pressurized water design used
by all other naval reactors and most of the nation's civilian power
reactors.
   NRDC said the reactor most likely would be installed in a
prototype plant that has no containment system, the steel and
concrete structure surrounding civilian reactors to confine
radioactive material in an accident.
   The department statement said there is a containment structure,
but an NRDC expert was quoted as saying it is not comparable to one
on a civilian power plant.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell and
ended the day with a moderate loss Thursday, and the dollar
finished lower against the yen.
   The dollar ended at 158.85 yen, down 0.48 yen from Wednesday's
close of 159.25 yen. The currency opened at 158.65 yen and ranged
between 158.65 yen and 159.00 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 139.78 points, or 0.47
percent, closing at 29,424.58. The index, which rose 62.98 points
Wednesday, added more than 100 points by midmorning before falling
back in the afternoon.
   Traders said the Nikkei index rose in the early trading because
of the yen's recovery against the dollar but later fell back as
market players were reluctant to take positions.
   ``The majority of market players remained on the sidelines ahead
of the Golden Week holidays, while there was no active selling,''
said Yoshiro Inoue, a stock analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   A holiday week starts Saturday and continues through May 6 for
the majority of Japanese companies. The stock and currency markets
will close on April 30, May 3 and 4, all national holidays.
   An uptrend in the U.S. short-term interest rates and
uncertainties over the U.S. government bond auction in May also
contributed to the market's wait-and-see mood, he said.
   The dollar was higher from its opening in sympathy with the West
German mark. The mark rose against the yen on news reports the West
German central bank may raise its official discount rate shortly to
help stem inflation, said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical
Bank in Tokyo.
   Higher interest rates tend to make the respective country's
currency more attractive to foreign currency investors.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond
rose to 86.03 from Wednesday's close of 85.92. That dropped the
yield to 7.36 percent from 7.385 percent.

<HEAD>Researchers Report Possible Cause of L-Tryptophan Illness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal official says studies in two states
have tied the sometimes fatal blood disorder linked to the dietary
supplement L-tryptophan to a single Japanese company.
   ``These are the first preliminary reports linking consumption of
L-tryptophan from one specific company to this syndrome,'' Food and
Drug Administration spokesman Jeff Nesbit said Wednesday.
   L-tryptophan has been linked to 21 deaths and more than 1,500
reports of illness from a disorder called eosinophilia-myalgia, or
EMS.
   The FDA last month declared L-tryptophan a ``major public health
problem'' and expanded its recall of the supplement, commonly sold
in health food stores as a remedy for insomnia, appetite control
and depression.
   Federal researchers who conducted studies in Oregon and
Minnesota presented their results at a forum at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta on Wednesday, said Nesbit.
   He said the studies strongly suggest something contaminated the
L-tryptophan produced by the company.
   The Washington Post, in today's editions, quoted a spokesman for
the Showa Denko Co., one of Japan's largest chemical manufacturers,
as saying the studies ``showed a strong statistical association
between our product and EMS.''
   ``But it is important to note that the studies do not
independently identify the precise cause of EMS,'' the spokesman,
Bob Schwadron, told the newspaper.
   Nesbit said three other studies in progress are expected to be
completed in a month or two.
   ``The first two cases made public in Atlanta do indicate that
one company is responsible, but we won't know whether that will
hold true for the remaining three until we're finished,'' he said.
   EMS is marked by severe muscle and joint pain, breathing
difficulties, swelling of the arms and legs, skin rash, fatigue,
cough and sometimes fever. In some cases, victims show signs of
congestive heart failure and develop a condition that causes
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis.

<HEAD>Experts Say Polio To Be Disappear From Western Hemisphere This
Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Polio probably will be stamped out by the end
of the year in the Western Hemisphere, according to public health
experts who say there has been surprising progress reportged
against the crippling disease in Latin America.
   ``At the moment we're having a hard time finding the virus at
all,'' D.A. Henderson, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Public
Health, said in an interview Wednesday.
   He credited efforts that included health workers going
door-to-door with the vaccine in urban and other high risk areas.
   When the Pan American Health Organization in 1985 set 1990 as a
goal for eradicating polio in the Americas, ``we all said this is
going to be tough ... that probably is optimistic,'' he said.
   ``Then suddenly this program began to move and polio has
vanished at a pace we could not believe,'' said Henderson,
president of the Association of Schools of Public Health, which met
in Washington this week.

   Opponents of the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power

the plant pending court appeals.
   In a petition Wednesday to Supreme Court Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, the opponents repeated arguments about the safety of the

   Those arguments have failed to persuade the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the U.S. Court of Appeals. A full federal appeal is
scheduled for Sept. 18. But opponents argue that by that time
Seabrook will be operating at full power.
   The petition, filed by Massachusetts Attorney General James

Seabrook license granted March 1 by the NRC.

   The Bush administration is asking for more
authority to act against companies that abuse or defraud the Food
and Drug Administration.
   The legislation was submitted Wednesday in response to the
generic drug scandal in which drug manufacturers were found to have
misrepresented their products and bribed FDA officials to win
approval to market their drugs.
   ``We must have the legal tools to move quickly and decisively
against anyone who seeks to mislead or subvert the FDA,'' said
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   The measure would authorize the FDA to debar anyone the agency
considered a threat to the integrity of the agency's product review
process and to refuse to review or approve any products submitted
by a debarred company.

<TEXT>
   Angered over continued Sandinista
domination of the army and police, the Contras are defying
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's appeals to lay down their
weapons and rejoin civilian life.
   A representative of the president, Roberto Ferrey, traveled
Wednesday to a special security zone where the rebels are supposed
to disband under U.N. supervision.
   Hours after Mrs. Chamorro was sworn in on Wednesday , he urged
about 500 armed rebels seated in columns on a sunbaked slope to lay
down their weapons.
   ``You of the resistance must understand that you are not
defeated soldiers; that you are heroic combatants who, for love of
your country, are willing to lay down your arms and return to
civilian life,'' Ferrey said at the close of his 15-minute address
through a megaphone.
   Previous speakers _ one a representative of Nicaragua's Roman
Catholic archbishop, and the other, Arturo Garzon of the
Organizaton of American States _ received polite applause.
   But Ferrey was met with stony silence and stares.
   Guerrillas who rose during the following 40 minutes to challenge
and question him were heartily cheered, especially when they said
they were unwilling to disband while the Sandinista army remained
intact.
   Garzon issued what he termed ``an invitation and an
exhortation'' to the Contras to avail themselves of OAS aid once
they decided to hand over their weapons.
   Of the dozens interviewed at the assembly, however, not a single
Contra said he would hand over his weapon as long as the
Sandinistas controlled the army and security forces.
   Under an agreement signed last week by leaders of the Contras,
the Sandinistas and the new government, the rebels were to begin
demobilizing Wednesday.
   But the accord appeared headed for a breakdown because Mrs.
Chamorro decided as a concilatory measure to allow Gen. Humberto
Ortega, brother of former President Daniel Ortega, to stay on as
head the army.
   Top Contra commander Israel Galeano addressed the troops after
meeting briefly with Maj. Jose Luis Grazia of Spain, who was in El
Destino representing the U.N. Central American peacekeeping force.
   The guerrillas broke out in laughter over the suggestion they
lay down their arms. ``Nobody gives up his gun!'' shouted one, and
all cheered.
   The peacekeepers have no mandate to forcibly disarm the Contras.
   El Destino is part of security Zone 1, which is 85 miles north
of Managua and covers 174 square miles.
   While it is not the largest of five zones designated for the
Contra demobilization, it is thought to harbor the most fighters.
About 3,000 Contras are estimated to have arrived in the past week.
   About 9,000 Contras are to gather in the zones in coming days.
   The rebels in Zone 1, who roam the area at will, are
unsupervised and have Soviet-made assault rifles, grenade launchers
and other weaponry.
   Ferrey appealed for demobilization before June 10, the date
agreed to in the pact signed last week by Oscar Sobalvarro, the No.
2 man in the Contra command.
   Several Contras, though, rose to challenge Ferrey.
   ``Jackson,'' a regional Contra commander, told the group: ``I'd
rather take to the mountains, live in the jungle with my comrades
until our conditions are met. And those conditions have not yet
been met.''

<HEAD>Doctors Say Liz Taylor Nearly Died Over the Weekend</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Taylor has rallied from a
near-fatal bout with pneumonia _ and even joked about coming out in
her ``balcony attire'' to wave to reporters _ but is ``not out of
the woods,'' doctors say.
   ``I believe her life was in jeopardy over the weekend and I
believe that has now passed,'' Dr. Bernard Weintraub, a lung
specialist treating Miss Taylor at St. Johns Hospital and Health
Center, said Wednesday.
   The 58-year-old actress was taken off the ventilator that had
aided her breathing for several days and was smiling again and
``very happy the tube was out,'' said Dr. Patricia Murray, an
infectious disease specialist.
   ``She said she'd come out and wave to you but she's not in her
balcony attire,'' the doctor said.
   About 80 reporters and camera crew members, along with some 100
St. Johns employees, jammed the hospital courtyard to hear the
latest reports on Miss Taylor.
   Miss Taylor has had back troubles since she fell off a horse
during filming in 1945 of ``National Velvet.'' She had to undergo a
tracheotomy during a bout with pneumonia in 1961 that nearly killed
her.
   In 1983 she acknowledged a 35-year addiction to sleeping pills
and painkillers, and her weight has been up and down over the years.
   In response to persistent rumors about AIDS and other illnesses,
Weintraub said there was ``no suggestion of either cancer or
infections commonly seen in AIDS.'' The actress had issued a
statement earlier denying she has AIDS.
   Weintraub said the actress, hospitalized since April 9, remained
in intensive care.
   ``She is in serious condition. She is not out of the woods,'' he
said.
   With her were her four children from three marriages, Maria
Burton-Carson, Liza Todd-Tivey and Christopher and Michael Wilding.
   The hospital released a statement on Miss Taylor's behalf
thanking fans and friends for their cards and letters.

   It's a December-May romance _ she's 72, he's
22.
   But Mary and Daniel Huntley, who got married this week, think
mostly about the month of March.
   ``We met a month ago at a country dance,'' Mrs. Huntley said.
``It was love at first sight.''
   Does the age difference matter?
   ``Not a bit in the world,'' Mrs. Huntley said in a telephone
interview Wednesday night.
   ``My mother didn't like it,'' said Huntley, although his wife
figured out why.
   She was ``sore because she wasn't asked to the wedding,'' said
Mrs. Huntley. ``We didn't invite anybody. We didn't have time.''
   The couple, who live in the southwestern Illinois community of
Pittsfield, were visiting Hardin 50 miles north when they decided
to get married. He already had proposed, but no date had been set.
   Circuit Judge Robert Welch married them Tuesday. Mrs. Huntley's
daughter, 32-year-old Becky Mielke, was maid of honor.
   Mrs. Huntley, a widow whose first husband died five years ago,
has 11 children, 23 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
   Huntley, an unemployed janitor, remembers when he asked his
bride to marry him, at 3 a.m. two weeks ago.
   ``We had been courtin' a few weeks,'' he said. ``We were
drinking coffee and listening to Hank Williams Jr. on the radio. I
turned and said, `Mary Alice, will you marry me?'''
   She did not hesitate.
   ```I do,' I answered. I meant, `I will.' I was a little
nervous,'' Mrs. Huntley said.

<HEAD>Jazzman Dexter Gordon Dead at 67</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saxophonist Dexter Gordon, who had dazzled
jazz audiences since the '40s with his complex be-bop stylings and
lumbering yet dignified stage presence, is dead at 67.
   He died Wednesday of kidney failure at Thomas Jefferson
University Hospital, where the New Yorker had been admitted March
18 with cancer of the larynx, said Don Lucoff, spokesman for Blue
Note Records in New York.
   Gordon helped define be-bop in the '40s and he was the last in a
line of saxophone geniuses that included Lester Young, Charlie
Parker and John Coltrane.
   He reached a new audience as the Oscar-nominated star of the
1986 film ``Round Midnight,'' and recently finished filming the
movie ``Awakenings,'' with Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.
   ``It's very, very difficult to even contemplate that we've lost
such a great master of his instrument and incredible human being,''
said guitarist George Benson.
   ``He was one of the true giants of the tenor saxophone,''
fluegelhorn player Art Farmer said from his home in Vienna. ``He
was an inspiration to me, although I didn't play saxophone, going
back over 40 years.''
   Drummer Art Blakey, performing in Seattle, said he and Gordon
played together in one of the early Billy Eckstine bands, and he
played on one of Gordon's last albums.
   ``He called me last week, wanted me to see him. I thought he was
coming back to New York,'' Blakey said. ``Gonna miss him.''
   Gordon's style was his own but his life bore tragic similarities
to the other jazz greats: exile, bouts of drug and alcohol abuse, a
stint in prison on drug charges.
   Gordon combined Young's melodic approach with the hard-driving
sound and complex harmonics of Coleman Hawkins and Parker. At a
set's end he would hold out his horn as if presenting it to the
audience for a share of the applause.
   Gordon went to Europe in 1962 for a three-month tour and ended
up staying for 14 years, first in Paris, then Denmark.
   ``I met him in Europe in a jazz club in Copenhagen,'' Benson
recalled. ``They called him, I think it was correct, King Gordon
Dexter. ... His music was always par excellence.''
   It was those years as an expatriate that led director Bertrand
Tavernier to cast Gordon in ``Round Midnight,'' the bittersweet
tale of an American jazz musician in Paris and an admiring French
fan.
   The film was loosely based on the life of pianist Bud Powell but
had many parallels with Gordon's _ and with those of many jazz
artists who fled bigotry and rough times in America for Europe in
the 1950s and '60s.
   The 6-foot-5 Gordon, who dominated the film with his smoky
voice, smooth sax playing and world-weary yet regal bearing, was
nominated for an Academy Award _ a first for a musician.
   ``The story is so personal. I don't mean Dexter Gordon, but this
long line of musicians who have been under-appreciated and ...
swindled,'' he said in 1986.
   The film sparked new interest in his career, which began in the
1930s when he went to jazz concerts with his father, a Los Angeles
physician whose patients included Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton.
   Gordon performed in clubs as a teen-ager and soon played with
the big bands of Hampton, Louis Armstrong and Eckstine.
   His mentors were Young and Herschel Evans, and he refined the
innovations Parker had laid down. Gordon, in turn, helped shape the
style and music of Coltrane and Sonny Rollins.
   He left Eckstine to work on 52nd Street _ the jazz capital in
New York _ performing with Parker, Miles Davis, Powell and Max
Roach, and recording with Dizzy Gillespie.
   By the late '40s, he was fronting his own groups. He and his
style of music faded from view in the '50s, during which he served
two years in prison in California on drug charges. After prison, he
recorded five acclaimed albums for Blue Note from 1961 to 1965.
   Among his more highly regarded albums are ``Long Tall Dexter,
The Savoy Sessions,'' ``Doin' Alright,'' ``Dexter Calling,'' ``Our
Man in Paris'' and ``A Swingin' Affair.''
   Gordon was survived by his wife, Maxine; two daughters and three
sons.
   A memorial was planned for May 6 in New York, Lucoff said.

<HEAD>Baskin-Robbins Strikes Sweet Deal With Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Baskin-Robbins Inc. will build a $30
million ice cream plant near Moscow, sweetening the deal with a new
flavor called ``Gorba Chocolate.''
   The factory, to open in 1992 in the suburb of Ostankino, will be
a joint venture with a Soviet trade ministry. About 100 Soviet
workers will be employed at the plant, said William I. Savel,
Baskin-Robbins president and chief executive.
   Its yearly production of 8 million gallons will begin with 10
kinds of ice cream, far fewer than the company's famous 31 flavors.
It's a lot more than Muscovites are used to, though. Only chocolate
and vanilla are now available in the Soviet Union.
   ``Their ice cream is good, but our ice cream is better and we
have a greater variety,'' Savel said.
   The Glendale-based franchiser, a subsidiary of Britain's
Allied-Lyons PLC, reached the Soviet agreement Tuesday. It said it
will inaugurate the deal with its new Gorba Chocolate flavor, a
white and dark chocolate concoction.
   The ice cream initially will be sold at thousands of
government-managed food stores in the Moscow area, Savel said.
Baskin-Robbins hopes to expand its selection and markets for
nationwide distribution.
   ``If they go into private ownership, we could sign on
franchisees there too,'' Savel said.
   Baskin-Robbins, which has sold ice cream at the Rossiya Hotel in
Moscow since 1988, will generate hard currency by selling about 10
percent of its product at Soviet stores that cater to tourists and
accept only convertible currency.
   Non-convertible rubles from the food stores will be used for
plant supplies and expansion.

<HEAD>Nikkei, Dollar Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell
moderately today, and the dollar declined against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 139.78 points, or 0.47
percent, closing at 29,424.58. The index, which rose 62.98 points
Wednesday, had added more than 100 points by midmorning Thursday
before falling back.
   Traders attributed the decline to caution ahead of a long
holiday period as well as concern over U.S. interest rate movements.
   ``Nobody wants to buy issues ahead of long holidays, especially
when they are discouraged by the recent uptrend in the U.S.
interest rates,'' said a Nomura Securities trader, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Japan's Golden Week series of holidays starts Saturday and
continues through May 6 for most Japanese companies. Next week, the
stock and currency markets will be open only on Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   The trader said the index rose in early trading following the
yen's recovery against the dollar, but then fell back as market
players took to the sidelines.
   Today's trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at
550 million shares, down from Wednesday's 700 million.
   Meanwhile, the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced that arbitrage
trading for the previous week amounted to 57.9 million shares worth
$503 million. Arbitrage selling totaled 22.4 million shares worth
$195 million.
   Arbitrage selling, to take profits on price gaps between the
spot and the futures markets, has been cited as one cause of the
market's plunge since the beginning of this year.
   It was the first time the exchange announced arbitrage figures,
a move intended to reduce investors' uncertainties.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 158.77 yen, down 0.48 yen from
Wednesday's close of 159.25 yen. It opened at 158.65 yen and ranged
between 158.65 yen and 159.00 yen.
   Dollar-yen dealing was inactive ahead of the holidays, said
Yoshitsugu Hanada, a dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Predicting a strengthening of the yen after the holidays, Hanada
said: ``Considering the higher nominal interest rates in Japan,
whose long-term interest rates have stayed above 7 percent, it is
about time for investors to shift their interest to the yen.''
   The dollar gained in early trading as market players bought West
German marks for yen on news reports that the West German central
bank may raise its official discount rate shortly to help stem
inflation, said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in
Tokyo.
   Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more
attractive to foreign currency investors.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds
closed at 86.09 points, up from Wednesday's close of 85.92. The
yield slipped to 7.350 percent from the previous day's 7.385
percent.

   The acquittal of a former foster care
counselor marked prosecutors' third defeat in three attempts to
hold social workers responsible for the death of a toddler dunked
headfirst in a toilet for soiling his pants.
   Shirley Duboise was acquitted Wednesday on a misdemeanor charge
stemming from the death last year of 2-year-old Bradley McGee.
   Ms. Duboise and three other Health and Rehabilitative Services
workers were the first state workers ever charged with neglecting
to report suspected child abuse.
   So far two of the workers have been acquitted, charges were
dropped against a third, and the last is awaiting trial.
   ``I think it's political,'' defense attorney Nat White said of
the prosecution. ``At the time Bradley died, everybody was
outraged. The public wanted some heads and the State Attorney's
office delivered.''
   Bradley, abandoned as an infant, was in foster care most of his
life until he was returned to his parents two months before his
death. He died July 28 after being dunked headfirst in a toilet
during potty training, authorities said.
   Bradley's mother, Sheryl Coe of Lakeland, was sentenced last
week to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder. The
murder trial of her husband, Thomas Coe, is set for July.
   Bradley's foster mother, Pam Kirkland, testified that the boy
had returned upset from an unsupervised visit with his parents
April 26, 1989, with cuts on his hand, a cigarette burn and a red
mark behind his ear.
   She said she showed the marks to Ms. Dubois, who testified she
took no action because all she remembers was little more than a
splinter on the boy's finger.
   The trial evolved into a question of who the jury believed, the
43-year-old defendant or the foster mother.
   After barely an hour, the jury returned its innocent verdict.
   ``We were frankly a little surprised the judge didn't dismiss it
right after the prosecution brought out its case,'' said jury
foreman Hazen Kelley.
   ``We felt we would be doing a disservice if our decision made
people scared they would have to call the HRS every time they see a
scratch on a child.''
   Mrs. Dubois, who could have faced up to 60 days if convicted,
said Assistant State Attorney John Aguero ``should have owned up
and been a man and dismissed all these cases when he realized he
didn't have anything.''
   Aguero refused to comment.
   The last worker to face trial is Bradley's caseworker, Margaret
Barber, who in addition to the misdemeanor of failing to report
suspected abuse is charged with child abuse. If convicted, she
could face up to 5 years in prison.

<HEAD>Search for Cartel Leader Intensifies After Bloody Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEDELLIN, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After at least six people were killed
by a bomb police said drug traffickers hid in a dump truck, police
helicopters dropped leaflets on Medellin seeking help in capturing
Colombia's top cocaine lord.
   Authorities blame Pablo Escobar, the leader of the powerful
Medellin cocaine cartel, for Wednesday's bombing and hundreds of
other attacks in response to the government's 8-month-old war on
drugs.
   ``It is easy to see that Pablo Escobar is behind all of these
violent, criminal actions,'' said Interior Minister Horacio Serpa.
``We have to say frankly that Pablo Escobar is Colombia's public
enemy No. 1.''
   Authorities intensified the search for Escobar in this cocaine
center and nearby towns. Police patrols swept neighborhoods where
he was suspected of hiding, and the city's army intellegence unit
said it was ready to check any leads from citizens.
   The bomb, packing more than 400 pounds of dynamite, exploded
Wednesday morning as a vehicle full of elite anti-narcotics police
passed by.
   Two police officers and four civilians were killed, including
three women and a child. Scores of people were injured, including
many aboard a bus.
   Commuters, their clothes torn and their bodies bloodied, pleaded
for help as they crawled from the bus' shattered windows, witnesses
said.
   The explosion severely damaged many buildings and homes in the
middle-class neighborhood in west Medellin.
   ``I'm furious and scared,'' said a toy shop owner, who
identified herself only as Claudia. ``It's one thing when you see
this kind of thing on television. It's another when the bomb goes
off on your doorstep.''
   She said two of her female employees were killed as they walked
from a nearby cafeteria to open the shop.
   The truck bombing was the second blast this month targeting
anti-terrorist police in Medellin.
   On April 11, a car bomb exploded on a busy highway, killing 20
people, including eight members of the special anti-narcotics
police unit.
   Since then, police have sent thousands of reinforcements to the
area to search for Escobar.
   On Tuesday night, President Virgilio Barco put the military in
charge of two towns near Medellin, Bello and Estrella, and scores
of troops and armored cars mounted with cannons moved into the
towns.
   Another nearby town, Envigado, was put under military rule last
month.
   Authorities blame the Medellin cartel for the deaths of 60
Medellin police officers this year. The cartel has offered to pay
$4,300 for each policeman murdered.
   The terrorism campaign began in August after the Barco
government intensified a war on the country's cocaine cartels,
based in the cities of Medellin and Cali.
   Medellin's mayor, Juan Gomez, said in a televised interview that
bombers should ``quit damaging the city.''
   He has called repeatedly for government negotiations with
traffickers to end the violence. The Barco administration has said
it will never negotiate with the cocaine cartels.
   ``I don't know why we have to put up with a mayor that wants to
talk to these monsters,'' said the toy shop owner.
   But a neighborhood resident, Francisco Alvarez, said he was
angry at the Barco administration.
   ``The government says it is fighting with the drug traffickers,
but it is the common people who are dying,'' he said. ``The only
way to stop this insanity is through a dialogue with the drug
mafia.''
   The traffickers demand that the government stop extraditing drug
suspects to face trial in the United States. Colombia has
extradited 15 alleged cartel middlemen since the crackdown began.

<HEAD>Sotheby's Buying Out Gallery For $142.8 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sotheby's, departing from its role as an auction
house, is financing the $142.8 million purchase of the contents of
a distinguished New York art gallery.
   Sotheby's has agreed to finance the purchase of the Pierre
Matisse Gallery, one of the foremost inventories of 20th-century
art, in an agreement with art dealer William Acquavella, said Diana
C. Brooks, president of Sotheby's in North America.
   The gallery was founded by Pierre Matisse, the son of painter
Henri Matisse. Its inventory has 2,300 works by artists such as
Joan Miro, Marc Chagall and Alberto Giacometti.
   Acquavella will be managing partner of the joint venture
company, which will be called Acquavella Modern Art, The New York
Times reported today. Acquavella said he plans to sell the
paintings privately over a period of time.
   Until now, Sotheby's has represented sellers and has not owned
most of the works it has sold. But with this move, Sotheby's
acquires a substantial inventory of artwork and enters the gallery
business.
   Sotheby's has expanded its operations in the art world since
real estate tycoon A. Alfred Taubman bought it in 1983.
   The auction house in 1988 started Sotheby's Financial Services,
a subsidiary that lends money to sellers, buyers and owners of art.
   More recently Sotheby's has offered guaranteed minimum prices
for consigned pieces of art, even if the work does not sell at
auction.
   ``I think once more it is another confirmation that Sotheby's
has really become an art dealer,'' David P. Tunick, a New York art
dealer and board member of the Art Dealers Association of America,
told the Times. ``To any longer describe themselves as an objective
middleman is wrong.''

<HEAD>State Defends Decision to Release Accused Gunman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia's human resources chief says a state
mental hospital followed procedure in releasing a man who shot and
killed someone at a shopping mall the next day.
   James Ledbetter, commissioner of human resources, said
psychiatrists determined James Calvin Brady, 31, was no danger
himself or others when he was released from Georgia Regional
Hospital in Atlanta on Monday.
   Brady on Tuesday killed one person and wounded four in a
shooting rampage, police said.
   ``It's a very difficult decision to predict future behavior, and
that's essentially what our staff is called on to do,'' Ledbetter
siad. ``We are not perfect.''
   A court hearing was scheduled today to determine which hospital
records should be turned over to the public defender's office and
police.
   Ledbetter said Gov. Joe Frank Harris asked him to review the
decision to release Brady.
   ``When I looked at it, I just didn't find the weaknesses that
the tragedy would suggest,'' Ledbetter said. ``I believe that the
decisions that were made were consistent with standard medical
procedure and with the policies of the department.''
   The gunman, smiling and wearing a gray suit, fired a handgun
into a lunch-time crowd at Perimeter Mall. After throwing his gun
into a trash can, Brady surrendered just outside the main entrance,
police said.
   Brady told authorities his attack was motivated by revenge
against people in California who, seeking to control him, had
implanted a mechanical device in his body.
   Brady has been charged with murder in the death of Michael
Gregory Musick, 24, and four counts of aggravated assault. He was
taken to a state mental hospital in Milledgeville to a await a
preliminary hearing May 1.
   Two of the victims remained hospitalized, one in serious
condition and another in fair.
   Before the preliminary hearing, psychiatrists will attempt to
determine whether Brady is competent to stand trial, said his
lawyer, public defender Larry Schneider.
   ``Obviously when he walks in and shoots a bunch of people before
200 witnesses you think about an insanity plea,'' Schneider said.
   DeKalb County police said the gunman carried documents from the
hospital in Atlanta indicating he had been diagnosed as having
homicidal tendencies.
   But Harris said, ``I think you'll find when the information
comes out that that's not exactly the case.''
   Police said Brady bought the revolver and 12 rounds of
hollow-point ammunition, a type designed to expand on impact and
cause particularly severe wounds, for $139 Monday at a pawn shop in
an Atlanta suburb.

<HEAD>Prison Siege Ends; Dispute Erupts Over Decision Not To Use Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the last five rebellious inmates surrendered
at Strangeways prison, debate began immediately over whether
authorities should have used force early on to end what became a
25-day standoff.
   Today's headline in the Daily Mail newspaper, which supports
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, said: ``Prison farce
ends at last.''
   ``The inmates ... have strutted, simpered and snarled at the ...
TV cameras,'' said an editorial. ``The Home Office its ministers
and its prison service have been humiliated repeatedly and
publicly.''
   But the secretary of the Home Office, which is in charge of
prisons, said after visiting Strangeways on Wednesday night: ``I
think the end result justified the tactics employed.''
   Secretary David Waddington denied suggestions at a news
conference that the decision not to use force had made the prison
service a laughingstock. ``I ask you to examine your conscience and
if you would be making the same criticism of me if the prison had
been stormed and five officers killed,'' he said.
   The defiance at Strangeways, in the northern city of Manchester,
prompted copycat trouble at more than a dozen other prisons.
   The siege at Strangeways ended Wednesday when the last five
inmates were lowered at their own request from the roof of the
prison chapel to the courtyard 150 feet below in a hydraulic lift.
   The trouble began April 1 at Sunday services in the chapel.
About 300 inmates overpowered guards, stole their keys and got into
other parts of the prison. Other inmates joined what became a riot,
starting fires and destroying large areas of the prison, but most
surrendered within days.
   A prisoner awaiting trial on charges of sexually assaulting
children died of injuries suffered at the hands of other inmates.
   Prisoners' relatives told of overcrowding in the prison, which
was built in 1868 to house 970 men and held 1,648 when the rioting
erupted.
   During the siege, prison authorities used sirens and
firecrackers to deprive the rebellious inmates of sleep and try to
wear down their resistance. Other tactics included spraying jets of
water to drench the prisoners and put out fires they started. The
inmates responded by hurling roof tiles and bricks and shouting
abuse at guards.
   They danced on the roof for scores of TV and press cameras as
relatives and supporters gathered to cheer them on.
   On one occasion, TV viewers saw one inmate appear on the roof,
bawl out ``Good morning, Manchester'' and do exercises.
   On Wednesday morning, 100 guards in riot gear moved into the
prison, trapping the five on the prison chapel roof. But again, no
violence was used.
   The renegades had armed themselves with crudely fashioned
weapons and erected barricades and booby traps, and authorities
feared loss of life or injuries in force was used.
   News reports indicated some anxiety among Mrs. Thatcher's
governing Conservatives over possible harm to their image as the
party of law and order. The party is already in deep political
trouble with voters over an unpopular new tax.
   The liberal London newspaper The Guardian quoted rank-and-file
Tory legislators as saying only the party's electoral fragility had
prevented an explosion of indignation over how the standoff was
handled.
   John Bartell, chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, the
guards' trade union, also criticized the way the siege was allowed
to continue.

   A Northwest Airlines pilot who insisted on
urine and blood tests after a passenger questioned his sobriety
tested negative for alcohol, the airline says.
   ``That's the end of it, as far as we're concerned,'' Northwest
spokesman Bob Gibbons said Wednesday.
   A Northwest flight from Detroit to Atlanta was delayed four
hours last week when the pilot, whom Northwest refused to identify,
confronted a woman who had suggested he was delayed because he was
``partying.''
   The woman, Ann Beaver of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said Saturday
she was only joking, but the pilot took her seriously. The pilot
had been assigned to the flight after the scheduled pilot was
delayed.
   After the pilot left the plane for the tests, the flight was
further delayed while the airline sought another substitute pilot.
   When the plane finally left, Beaver and her husband stayed
behind because other passengers were furious with them, Northwest
said. The couple took a flight Friday.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced to Life on Cocaine Charge is Freed After 8 Years
In Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARGARET STAFFORD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman sentenced to life in prison for
a first-offense cocaine conviction was freed by a judge who ruled
that her defense was incompetent and the jury stacked. She had
served 8{ years in prison.
   Deborah Pilchak, 37, tearfully embraced her mother after her
release became official during a brief hearing in federal court
Wednesday.
   The state said it would appeal Ms. Pilchak's release, but U.S.
District Judge Joseph E. Stevens ruled that she deserved to be free
until her case is decided.
   Ms. Pilchak said she planned to spend her first day of freedom
``eating and shopping.''
   ``I am very happy, I feel so free,'' Ms. Pilchak said. ``I can't
really describe how good this feels.''
   Stevens ruled last month that Ms. Pilchak received an unfair
trial for cocaine charges in Cole County Circuit Court. He gave the
state 30 days to set aside the conviction and release her or set a
new trial.
   Ms. Pilchak's court-appointed attorney was suffering from
Alzheimer's disease and had not prepared a defense, Stevens said.
The jurors came from a pool selected by the sheriff, a common
practice, but in this case the sheriff had investigated the case.
   Ms. Pilchak said she was not angry about the way the case had
been handled.
   ``It was extremely unfortunate that this happened to me,'' Ms.
Pilchak said. ``I'm mostly sad about it. I hope it doesn't happen
to anybody else.''
   She was arrested in Jefferson City in December 1981 and charged
with aiding and abetting her boyfriend in the sale of 26 ounces of
cocaine to an undercover drug agent. Her sentence came although she
was a first-time offender.
   A few months after her trial, it became known that her attorney,
J. Paul Allred Jr., was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. And a
lawyer in another case discovered after Ms. Pilchak's trial that
the jury pool was chosen by the sheriff who investigated the case.
   Ms. Pilchak's boyfriend, Gary McCaw, was tried separately and
sentenced to life in prison. A judge ruled that the jury selected
in that case also was flawed and ordered a new trial. McCaw pleaded
guilty and was sentenced to 26 years in prison. He has since been
freed.
   Ms. Pilchak has two children, a 20-year-old son and an
8-year-old daughter. The younger child has been in foster care and
a hearing is scheduled May 4 to determine whether Ms. Pilchak's
parental rights should be terminated.
   Steve Hawke, of the attorney general's office, said the state
would contend in its appeal that a state court had found
allegations about the improper defense and stacked jury to be
groundless.
   Under her original sentence, Ms. Pilchak could not have been
released from prison until December 1993.

   Lawmakers say they will ignore a judge who found
the state health chief in contempt for failing to provide money for
mental health programs.
   Superior Judge Bernard Dougherty on Wednesday gave the
Department of Health Services Director, Ted Williams, 15 days to
request an additional $45.2 million from the Legislature, which
would provide it.
   Legislators said Dougherty's order is meaningless and predicted
that it would be ignored. They said the money requested is not
available.
   ``The judge is in never-never land,'' said House Appropriations
Committee Chairman John Wettaw.
   Doughterty did not say what action he would take if Williams
failed to seek the additional money, or if the Legislature refused
to provide it.
   The battle over funding for the chronically mental ill began
with a class-action lawsuit against the state in 1981.
   Dougherty ruled in June 1985 that the state had to fully fund
programs mandated by the Legislature for people with chronic mental
illness, and the order was affirmed in March 1989 by the Arizona
Supreme Court.
   An advocacy group, the Center for Law in the Public Interest,
sought contempt sanctions against Williams and Gov. Rose Mofford,
contending neither had sought adequate funding to comply with the
order.
   The center argued that the state would have to spend an
additional $45.2 million next year to begin implementing the order,
while Williams sought only $12.3 million in his budget request to
the governor, and Mrs. Mofford asked the Legislature for only $1.6
million.
   The state Supreme Court dismissed the proceedings against Mrs.
Mofford on grounds that she was not a party to the original suit,
and that her actions are protected by the state constitution. But
the high court allowed the case against Williams.
   Beryl Dulsky, an assistant state attorney general who
represented Williams, said no decision had been made on an appeal.
Vada Manager, a spokesman for Mrs. Mofford, said ``we are exploring
the options.''
   Lawmakers were skeptical that Dougherty's order will result in a
substantial increase in funding for the chronically mentally ill.
   ``The Legislature does not respond very well to judicial
threats,'' said Senate Majority Leader John Mawhinney.
   Wettaw said lawmakers would ``do our best'' to provide
additional funding for mental health programs, but that it would
not be anywhere near $45.2 million.

<HEAD>Power Outage Blackens Much of City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blackout plunged much of this city of 610,000
people and its environs into darkness for several hours, and
traffic chaos downtown gave way to a big street party.
   The power outage occurred about 8 p.m. Wednesday after equipment
failure caused a transformer at a midtown station to explode and
catch fire, Ontario Hydro spokesman Bill Friday said.
   Several people reported seeing a fireball after the blast, but
officials said there were no serious injuries at the plant, which
was evacuated. The fire was out by 10 p.m.
   ``Everything was back on as of 1:10 a.m.,'' Friday said today.
``Ninety percent of the people affected had their power back by
11:30 p.m.''
   Police staff Sgt. Lou Villani said about 175 gallons of liquid
containing cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls spilled during
the fire but were contained inside the plant.
   Hydro spokesmen said the liquid did not pose a danger because
the PCB levels were well below provincial standards.
   At the height of the blackout, about 90,000 homes and 10,000
businesses were in the dark in Toronto and parts of suburban
Scarborough, East York and North York.
   Downtown stores closed, but there were reports of young looters
carrying leather jackets and stereos out of the Eaton Centre,
Villani said. Security staff sealed off the huge four-story mall
and no arrests were reported.
   Wednesday was the city's hottest April 25 on record _ 86 degrees
_ and thousands of people strolled along Yonge Street, the main
thoroughfare, reveling in the disorder and giving the street the
good-time, chaotic energy of a Saturday night.
   ``We're having an amazing time,'' said 19-year-old Michelle Em,
who took a break from her job at a leather goods store to cruise
the streets with two friends in a rented rickshaw.
   ``We've seen people preaching and singing. You name it, they're
doing it,'' she said.
   Police officers mixed with the crowds and cruisers joined the
traffic on the street.
   For several hours, pedestrians and drivers had to guess each
others' intentions before proceeding.
   Off-duty officers eventually were asked to direct the busiest
intersections, particularly around the SkyDome where more than
30,000 people poured out of a Toronto Blue Jays game. The stadium
did not lose power.
   At the King Edward Hotel, some guests were led to the lobby by
staff and treated to tea, coffee and pastries. Another staff member
played the piano.
   The show never started at the Pantages Theatre, where ``The
Phantom of the Opera'' was to have been performed.
   ``The bar was open,'' said theater-goer Dorothy Lillie. ``People
bought drinks and watched the beautiful people go by,'' she said as
she joined hundreds of others strolling along Younge Street.
   Joe Luciano of the Big Slice pizzeria moved a table onto the
street and hawked slices of pizza and soda.
   Gordon Miller, 64, who served in World War II, said it was
``just like London in the Blitz.''

artillery and tank fire overnight, and police said 22 people were
killed and 40 wounded.
   Several apartment buildings, service stations and warehouses
were set ablaze by the 14-hour shelling duel that marked a sharp
escalation of the power struggle for mastery of Lebanon's Christian
enclave.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 916 killed and
2,441 wounded since Jan. 30, when Aoun moved to crush Geagea's
6,000-strong Lebanese Forces militia that posed the main challenge
to his authority in the enclave.
   Police said Lebanese Forces' gunboats and multibarreled rocket
launchers blasted a makeshift harbor for Aoun's 19,000 troops in
the coastal town of Dbaye north of Beirut, setting its
installations afire.
   Aoun's mountain-top artillery positions struck at Geagea's
military headquarters in east Beirut's seaside Karantina district,
the adjacent Beirut port and the residential district of
Ashrafiyeh, police said.
   The fighting tapered off to sporadic sniping at daybreak.

   NASA expects up to 20,000
spectators to watch Discovery return from space Sunday, a fraction
of the number that greeted the early shuttle flights but far more
than have seen the last three landings.
   The shuttle is scheduled to land at 6:49 a.m. PDT Sunday,
winding up its five-day mission to deploy the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   The last time the public was invited to view a shuttle landing
was on Oct. 23, when 20,000 people watched Atlantis return.
   Because heavy rains had flooded the unpaved public viewing site,
NASA discouraged spectators when Columbia landed Jan. 20. Only
about 1,000 to 2,000 showed up for the 1:35 a.m. landing.
   The other two shuttle flights in recent months, Discovery's
flight that ended with a Nov. 27 landing and Atlantis' flight that
wound up March 4, were classified military missions and the general
public was barred.
   Crowds of up to 500,000 people have greeted shuttles in the
past. NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said she expected only 15,000
to 20,000 people Sunday because shuttle landings are becoming
routine again.
   Difficulties getting to the site also may decrease the number of
spectators.
   The main access road from the south is closed for resurfacing,
and would-be spectators driving from Los Angeles will be forced to
approach take a detour that will add about an hour to the usual
2{-hour drive, Lovato said Wednesday.
   The public viewing site will open 24 hours before Discovery
lands.

   Fair weather prevailed across most of the nation early today,
after a day of record-breaking high temperatures. Rain fell in the
Midwest and Southwest.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms from Texas to the
upper Great Lakes, showers in the Dakotas and Northern Rockies, and
more severe weather in north-central Texas, where tornadoes forced
at least 150 people from their homes.
   Colder weather was expected to bring snow to the Oregon Cascades
today.
   On Wednesday, thunderstorms ranged from Texas across the Deep
South, the Midwest and desert Southwest. Showers were scattered
across the Pacific Northwest.
   Two dozen high temperature records were broken or tied from the
central Atlantic states into the upper Mississippi Valley,
including 90 in Alpena, Mich., breaking a record of 86 set in 1982.
   The high temperature for the nation Wednesday was 98 at Palm
Springs, Calif.

   A DC-3 plane on a domestic flight
crashed and burned in a rice field on an army base near Manila
today, killing at least six people and injuring 16, officials said.
   The twin-engine, propeller plane narrowly missed a row of houses
for soldiers and their families at Fort Bonifacio, headquarters of
the Philippine army and located in the Manila suburb of Makati.
   Officials said all of the dead and injured were aboard the
plane, which burst into flames after the crash. The plane, owned by
Manila Air Transport System, was carrying 22 passengers and crew
members.
   The company said it would issue no statement on the crash
pending an investigation.
   Diosdado Santarin, a spokesman for the Manila airport emergency
services department, said the plane had just taken off for Roxas,
250 miles to the south, when the pilot reported engine trouble.
   Jaime Cruz, manager of the emergency services department, said
pilot Anastacio Maravilla tried to ditch the plane in a rice field
near the fort's Heroes' Cemetery but the right wing struck an
electricity post.
   The plane then slammed out of control into the field, Cruz said.
Survivors scurried from the wreckage before it exploded in flames,
he added.
   Officials said the dead were charred beyond recognition and
included a 2-year-old boy. Cruz said the plane crushed a
bicycle-driven cab, but the driver and his passenger were able to
run away before impact.
   Maravilla, who suffered minor injuries, told radio station DZBB
his left engine began losing power seconds after takeoff. He said
the plane was losing altitude so fast that he decided he could not
make it back to the airport.
   Pacita Sarte, 32, the passenger who abandoned the cab, said the
plane was so low that she could hear passengers screaming in terror.
   ``It's normal to see planes come and go in the area, even
low-flying ones,'' said the cab driver, Reynaldo Portuguez. ``But I
knew the plane was in trouble when I saw one of its engines
smoking.''

<HEAD>Bronx President Burned Up Over `Bonfire' Filming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bronx is getting burned by Hollywood's
portrayal of the New York City borough in the film ``The Bonfire of
the Vanities,'' the borough president says.
   ``The city and this borough do not have an obligation to help a
company make a motion picture that goes out of its way to denigrate
the Bronx,'' Borough President Fernando Ferrer told reporters
Wednesday.
   The Warner Bros. film, now in production, is based on Tom
Wolfe's scathing best seller of the same name, which tells the
story of a high-powered Wall Street executive who becomes entangled
in the city's Kafkaesque court system.
   Parts of the film, which features Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis and
Morgan Freeman, were shot at the Bronx County Courthouse.
   Ferrer asked Warner Bros. to run a 55-word statement at the end
of the film stressing the borough's positive aspects and ending
with the words: ``Bronx neighborhoods are home to cultural
institutions attracting more than 2,000,000 visitors a year.''
   In response, Warner Bros. offered to run this statement: ``This
film is a work of fiction and is not intended to reflect actual
events or conditions in the localities portrayed.''
   Ferrer claims the film company also offered to donate $10,000 to
the charity of Ferrer's choice. ``I not only find that offer
strange, but frankly bordering on the improper,'' the borough
president said.
   The Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting said the
idea for the contribution had come from Ferrer's office, but Ferrer
said the idea came from either that citywide office or Warner Bros.
   Fred Caruso, the film's co-producer, said the charity donation
``was not something generated or offered by us.''
   One of the scenes Ferrar found objectionable was between two
Bronx district attorneys:
   ``He pulled a knife on a 70-year-old lady, robbed her, raped her
and then shoved her in a garbage can,'' one says.
   ``Jesus,'' the other replies.
   ``Welcome to the South Bronx,'' laughs the first one.
   Said Caruso: ``The movie is not derogatory toward the Bronx, nor
is it a racist film.''
   Ferrer's criticism was reminiscent of a furor raised over the
1981 film, ``Fort Apache: The Bronx.'' That film triggered protests
and a boycott. Ferrer suggested a similar boycott might be
warranted against ``Bonfire.''

   After years of state-encouraged passivity, Soviets
today marked the fourth anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear plant
disaster with widespread protests, a 24-hour telethon and a strike
at a major factory.
   It was the biggest national commemoration yet of the 1986
tragedy, the world's worst nuclear power acccident.
   ``We have been silent too long,'' said a reporter on the TV news
program Vremya, which focused its afternoon show on Chernobyl
reports.
   Officially, 31 people were killed when one of four reactors at
Chernobyl caught fire and exploded on April 26, 1986, about 90
miles north of Kiev in the Soviet Ukraine. Unofficial reports say
at least 250 died.
   The blast spewed radioactive cesium, strontium and plutonium
isotopes across much of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia and
sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world.
   For the first two days after the accident, the Soviet Union
refused to report it to the outside world and withheld information
from its own people. Only last year did officials admit the full
scope of the contamination and decide to resettle 100,000 more
people.
   The official willingness to play up the Chernobyl anniversary
today appeared to reflect both the growing awareness of the
catastrophe's aftermath and the pro-democracy views of many newly
elected local governing councils.
   Residents in the southwestern Soviet regions most contaminated
by the blast organized protests to demand better medical treatment,
protection from radiation and punishment for the officials who
covered up the accident's effects, activists said.
   In the Byelorussian city of Gomel, most of the 35,000 workers of
the GomselMash industrial complex walked out on a daylong strike,
said Alexander Korniev, a plant worker.
   Strikers were demanding better medical care and wanted all
officials who participated in the cover-up brought to trial, he
said.
   The Chernobyl Telethon, one of the Soviet Union's first
experiences with television fundraising, collected $38 million,
organizers announced.
   The live broadcast, originating in Moscow, interspersed singing
groups and interviews with tragic footage showing Chernobyl
rescuers and children in the contaminated zone suffering from
radiation-caused cancers. Along with money, pledges to the telethon
center included donations of radiation-free fruit and even 1,100
pounds of honey for children in the contaminated area.
   CNN showed live scenes of the telethon to American viewers. Many
of the donations came from the United States, Japan and Western
Europe, the Soviet news agency Tass said.
   The Ukrainian legislature declared today ``Chernobyl Tragedy
Day'' and its Byelorussian counterpart passed a similar measure.
Other government bodies in the affected areas sanctioned widespread
demonstrations.
   On the eve of the anniversary, the Soviet legislature adopted a
$26 billion program that would involve resettling an additional
200,000 people from irradiated areas.
   The program was adopted Wednesday even though many members of
the legislature, the Supreme Soviet, criticized it as inadequate to
deal with the health, agricultural, economic and environmental
aftermath of the accident.
   After a day of debate, including charges of an official cover-up
of the disaster and bungled evacuations, legislators endorsed a
program for dealing with Chernobyl from 1990-1992, Tass reported.
   About 180,000 to 200,000 people still living in contaminated
areas four years after the accident are to be resettled.
   In the months after the accident, 116,000 people were evacuated,
and some Soviet scientists and politicians have been campaigning
since then for further resettlements. They say 4 million Soviets
are living on contaminated land.
   The $26 billion is a major increase in spending on the Chernobyl
aftermath. It is twice the level spent in the four years since the
accident but still short of the $405 billion legislator Yuri
Scherback has estimated is needed over the next 10 years.
   Many Chernobyl-area residents have complained of inadequate
medical care and cases of anemia, leukemia and cancers have been
reported rising among people living on irradiated land. Many
residents still eat irradiated food because alternatives are not
available.
   Dealing with the larger questions posed by Chernobyl, the
Supreme Soviet directed the government to draft a bill on the use
of nuclear energy and nuclear safety, and to phase out the
Chernobyl power plant.
   The three reactors not involved in the accident are still
operating. The Ukrainian legislature wants the plant closed by 1995.
   Several other nuclear power projects around the country were
canceled because of the heightened safety concerns generated by the
Chernobyl accident.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said in an interview published
today that the Soviet Union will not phase out nuclear energy
altogether, but it will improve safety systems.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed two
Palestinians and wounded about 120 today in the worst violence in
the uprising in nearly a year, hospital officials and Arab
witnesses said.
   The clash began as thousands of Moslem worshipers were passing
an army base in the Gaza Strip en route to a cemetery for a
religious holiday to honor the dead, witnesses said.
   An army spokesman who demanded anonymity said some of the
Palestinians started to throw rocks and bottles at the soldiers.
The soldiers, concerned about the potential danger to their lives,
responded with tear gas and later various types of ammunition, the
spokesman said.
   The army confirmed two Palestinians had been killed. It said
about 50 Arabs and seven soldiers were injured by stones in the
clash, which occurred on the Moslem holiday of Id al-Fitr that
celebrates the end of the month of Ramadan.
   According to witnesses interviewed in Gaza City hospitals, the
clash began as 4,000 Palestinians left two mosques after prayer
services in the crowded Jabaliya refugee camp, where the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation began more than 28
months ago.
   The army imposed a curfew on the camp of 53,000 residents and
declared the entire Gaza Strip a closed military zone, a move that
bars journalists from entering the area.
   Doctors said 61 gunshot victims were treated at Ahli hospital,
39 at Shifa hospital and 20 at U.N. clinics. More than 15 received
injuries from rubber pellets or were beaten with nightsticks.
   Jorgen Rosendal of Denmark, administrator of Al Ahli Arab
hospital, said it was the worst violence since three Palestinians
were killed and about 50 wounded during the Id al-Fitr holiday on
May 6, 1989.
   The casualties represented one of the largest tolls of wounded
from a single incident since the uprising began and contrasted with
the low level of conflict in recent months.
   An unemployed street vendor who was wounded in the right arm
told a reporter that soldiers fired tear gas when crowds chanting
``Allahu Akbar!'' or ``God is great!'' approached a fenced-off army
encampment en route to a cemetery to honor the dead in accordance
with Moslem tradition.
   The vendor, who gave only his first name, Ahmad, and other
witnesses said about 20 Israeli soldiers watching the crowd
apparently became alarmed and fired tear gas.
   ``We were heading to visit our dead people and then they started
shooting tear gas at us,'' Ahmad, 25, said. ``I think the army
thought we wanted to attack them after they saw such huge crowds
heading towards them. But if they hadn't fired tear gas nothing
would have happened.''
   After the tear gas was fired, Arab witnesses said scores of
Palestinians hurled stones at the army camp. Then a dozen border
police jeeps, several armored personnel carriers and a helicopter
came to the help the soldiers.
   Army spokesmen in Tel Aviv said the crowds ``interfered'' with
army activity but gave no details of why the soldiers started
firing. They said senior officers were investigating.
   Killed in the clash were two camp residents: Awadallah Ibrahim
Awadallh, 25, a laborer who was shot in the chest, and Khaled Musa
Aswad, 35, a mosque prayer caller who was shot in the stomach.
   Today's deaths brought to 678 the number of Palestinians killed
in clashes with Israelis since Dec. 8, 1987, when the uprising
began against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In addition, 209 Palestinians have been killed by other
Palestinians, most accused of collaborating with Israeli
authorites. Forty-three Israelis have died in the clashes.
   Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEAD>With New Selection System, Ole Miss Picks First Black Student
Editor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black student will run the University of
Mississippi school newspaper for the first time.
   Lee Eric Smith was named editor Wednesday by a selection
committee set up last month after protesting campus journalists
complained that the traditional election process picked politicians
_ not journalists.
   ``The accomplishment is I'm the first selected editor _ not that
I'm the first black editor,'' Smith said Wednesday.
   Smith, 20, a junior journalism major from Holly Springs, was
named editor of The Daily Mississippian over three other
candidates, all of them white. He was chosen by a board of
students, professional journalists and staff, said Samir Hussni,
journalism professor and chairman of the selection board.
   For 50 years, the editor of the Daily Mississippian was elected,
sometimes after spending hundreds of dollars on posters and fliers.
Critics said fraternities and sororities controlled the annual
elections, turning them into popularity contests.
   This year, the newspaper staff and other students launched a
protest, including producing an edition containing the U.S.
Constitution in place of the usual stories and another with several
blank pages. Some students upset by the protest responded by
scrawling obscenities on copies of the paper and scattering
hundreds of issues across campus.
   But in March, the student government voted to do away with
elections and create the selection committee.
   ``I'm happy that we selected the right person for the job,''
Husni said. ``He won by a large margin. The fact that he's black
had nothing to do with it, but now it's a historic decision.''
   About 10,000 students are enrolled at the antebellum campus, the
site of race riots in 1962 after a court ordered that a black
student be admitted. About 20 students work on the editorial side
of the 10,000-circulation paper.

<HEAD>Rioters Clash With Police in Southern Town: 4 Killed, 28 Injured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASSIUT, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired tear gas and birdshot today at
a crowd of 2,000 people who rioted after officers blocked their
traditional Moslem feast march. At least four people were killed
and 28 wounded, police said.
   Maj. Gen. Mahmoud el-Fakharany, security chief for Assiut
Province, said the riot occurred in the town of Manfalut, 25 miles
northwest of Assiut, after morning prayers celebrating the feast.
Police arrested 18O rioters.
   The provincial capital, Assiut, 235 miles south of Cairo, has
been the scene of frequent violence by Moslem fundamentalist
militants. They seek immediate implementation of Sharia, Islam's
legal and ethical code which includes harsh criminal penalties.
   But el-Fakharany said the militants did not engineer today's
disturbance. He said activist Islamic groups denounced the riot and
denied involvement.
   ``Most of the rioters were drug addicts, thugs and unemployed
people who were bent on troublemaking,'' el-Fakharany told The
Associated Press.
   Today was the first day of Eid al-Fitr, also known as Bairam,
which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan when Moslems fast
from dawn to dusk.
   Security and civic authorities decided to prevent a street march
this year because marchers previously had damaged shops and other
property, el-Fakharany said.
   After Bairam prayers this morning, he said, about 2,000 people
gathered in a square and prepared to march despite the ban.
   ``They did not heed police warnings to disperse and hurled
stones and pieces of wood at security forces at first,''
el-Fakharany said. ``Then some people in the crowd shot at the
forces with firearms they carried.''
   He said police initially used tear gas ``but switched to plastic
and then lead birdshot after rioters began using firearms. The
crowd then dispersed.''
   Police suffered no casualties, el-Fakharany said.

   Opposition politician Oskar Lafontaine
was in satisfactory condition today, one day after being stabbed in
the neck, and a party leader said Lafontaine would probably remain
a candidate for chancellor.
   The Social Democrat, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's leading challenger
in the December delection, lost a lot of blood in Wednesday's
attack, but friends who visited him today said he was able to get
out of bed and crack jokes.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, the Social Democratic Party chairman, said in
an interview with Deutsche Welle Radio that Lafontaine intends to
``remain the chancellor candidate.''
   Lafontaine, 46, the governor of tiny Saarland state, is one of
West Germany's most colorful, acid-tongued, and popular politicians.
   He was rushed to the University Clinic of Cologne in critical
condition after being stabbed with a butcher knife at a campaign
rally by a woman who repotedly had a history of mental problems.
   The candidate underwent two hours of surgery late Wednesday.
Doctors upgraded his condition overnight, and he awoke at 5 a.m.
   ``Considering the circumstances, his condition is
satisfactory,'' said Dr. Heinz Pichlmaier, the head of the team of
physicians treating Lafontaine.
   Vogel, who rushed to Cologne after the attack, said the knife
missed a main artery by just a ``couple of milimeters.''
   ``Otherwise, we would be mourning,'' he said.
   The knife cut a vein in Lafontaine's neck, but not one of the
two carotid arteries that carry blood to the brain, said Joachim
Hofmann-Goettig, a Saarland state spokesman.
   Hofmann-Goettig said that Lafontaine could be released from the
hospital as early as this weekend, but added that it was too early
to tell whether he would be able to challenge Kohl.
   ``We'll have to see how things go politically after he has
completely recovered physically and psychologically,''
Hofmann-Goettig said.
   It was the most serious attack on a top-ranking politician in
West Germany's 41-year history, and was likely to result in a
review of security measures as the election campaign intensifies.
   Police this morning resumed questioning the woman arrested in
the stabbing attack.
   Lafontaine was attacked near the close of campaign rally in
Cologne at about 9 p.m. by the black-haired woman in a white dress
who approached him on the dais seeking his autograph, witnesses and
officials said.
   The woman stabbed Lafontaine with a butcher knife as he was
about to sign a poetry album she presented him, police said. The
ZDF television network said the knife had been concealed in a
bouquet of flowers.
   The ARD television network showed Lafontaine lying on the floor
as blood poured from his neck, with several people crowded around
him trying to administer first aid. He was rushed by helicopter to
the hospital.
   The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
Hans-Juergen Foerster, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, said there was no evidence the woman had a ``terrorist
background.''
   She was identified as 42-year-old Adelheid Streidel of Bad
Neuenahr, southwest of Bonn. News reports said she had a history of
mental illness.
   After the attack, the woman sat impassively as a throng of
policemen screamed at her ``Who are you? Who are you? Tell us your
name! Say it!''
   But the woman said she was refusing to make any statements, and
police hustled her out of Stadthalle auditorium in suburban
Muelheim, where about 2,000 people had gathered for the rally.
   ZDF said she was convicted of arson in 1986 and had been sent to
a psychiatric institute.
   The Cologne newspaper Express said that she suffered from a
``persecution complex'' and quoted neighbors as saying she had
repeatedly sought to obtain weapons to defend herself from men she
thought were pursuing her.
   Reinhard Klimmt, the Social Democratic member of the Saarland
state parliament, said after visiting Lafontaine that he was weak
but ``mentally alert'' and cracking jokes.
   Vogel told colleagues Lafontaine had ``found his usual humor
again.''
   Lafontaine is known for making bold and brash political
statments and has delighted in his role as a political gadfly.
   The outspoken politician, whose party trounced Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union in state elections in January, has been considered
a tough opponent for the December national elections.

<HEAD>Mandela Makes Emotional Visit To His Old Village</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUNU, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela made an emotional
pilgrimage today to the tiny village where he grew up, saying the
poverty of rural blacks in South Africa makes his heart ``very sore
indeed.''
   The African National Congress leader greeted old friends,
reminisced about his youth and tossed sand on the graves of his
parents in a traditional act of reverence during a walk through
Qunu, part of the Transkei homeland in South Africa.
   ``I have found many changes,'' said Mandela, released in
February after 27 years in prison. ``Many villages which I see
today were not here'' when I was growing up, and new roads have
been built.
   Mandela paid a 15-minute visit Sunday to Qunu, his first since
1956. He spent several hours today speaking with virtually all of
Qunu's 1,000 or so residents. The villagers slaughtered two oxen to
celebrate Mandela's return.
   Qunu is a typical rural village in South Africa, made up of a
few hundred mud-and-thatch huts and free roaming goats, chickens,
sheep and cattle.
   Most of the residents are women, old men or children. Almost all
of the men of working age have left the village for jobs in the
cities or on the country's gold and coal mines.
   ``My heart becomes very sore indeed because the poverty that was
here when I last visited this place, that poverty is still there
staring me in the face,'' said Mandela, who once worked on the
mines before becoming a lawyer.
   Mandela urged the children to do well in school and recalled
that he failed classes one year in his early teens.
   ``I wasn't very bright then,'' he said.
   Mandela, smartly dressed in a suit and tie, said he wore only a
sheepskin blanket to school to ward off the cold on winter days.
   The hut were Mandela grew up is no longer standing, and his
closest relatives in Qunu are cousins. Mandela was accompanied
today by his wife, Winnie, and two of his sisters who now live
elsewhere.
   Mandela is the son of a chief of the royal Tembu clan of the
Xhosa tribe. His father was adviser to the paramount chief and
Mandela was raised as an aristocrat.
   Mandela, the ANC's deputy president, has spent all week in the
southeastern homeland, one of 10 black tribal reserves in South
Africa.
   The ANC opposes the existence of the homelands, which they see
as an attempt to deny blacks political rights in South Africa.
However, the organization has begun to work with several young
homeland leaders who are sympathetic to the ANC and its idea of
re-incorporating the territories into a united South Africa.
   Mandela will lead an 11-member ANC delegation in groundbreaking
talks next week with the white-led government.
   The ANC wants an end to South Africa's system of racial
separation and a one-person, one-vote system. Under apartheid,
South Africa's 28 million black majority has no vote.

<TEXT>
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
may have stalled a Sandinista revolt by letting Gen. Humberto
Ortega stay on as army chief, but the short-term solution to her
problems spells long-term trouble for her new government.
   Two would-be Cabinet ministers have refused their posts and
Contra rebels are reneging on a demobilization accord.
   The Contras last week signed an accord with Gen. Ortega and Mrs.
Chamorro's United National Opposition (UNO) to demobilize.
   But not a few laughed at the idea after Mrs. Chamorro received
the presidential sash from Daniel Ortega on Wednesday.
   Mrs. Chamorro took over as defense minister, but that did not
ease the anger over Gen. Ortega staying on. What the Contras want,
says rebel chief Israel Galeano, is for the Sandinistas to
relinquish all control of the military.
   The Sandinistas have warned of a renewed civil war if any
attempts are made to alter the armed forces in any profound way.
   How Mrs. Chamorro and her government solve this deadlock will
show whether they can deal with Nicaragua's complicated problems.
   Mrs. Chamorro's decision to stick to an agreement last month
that effectively allows the Sandinistas to keep control of the
armed forces has heightened the political split in the country.
   Mrs. Chamorro has been trying to close that chasm with calls for
reconciliation.
   But for either the Contras or the Sandinistas to give up their
weapons would be tantamount to surrender, and both sides claim
military victory in the 9-year-old civil war.
   Observers were surprised last week when the Contras, who had
said they would only negotiate demobilization with Mrs. Chamorro
once she was in power, signed an accord less than 24 hours later to
lay down their weapons.
   What was more surprising was that they did so without imposing
any conditions. That led to speculation that there had to be some
sort of secret pact between UNO and the Contras.
   Many of the estimated 9,000 rebel fighters inside Nicaragua have
begun streaming into five security zones staffed by a 700-member
U.N. peacekeeping force. The rebels are to give up their weapons
voluntarily.
   Once they do that, they can begin receiving food and medical
supplies from a mission of the Organization of American States.
   Many Contras interviewed in the countryside have said they are
indeed tired of fighting and want to go home. Others reportedly
have staged a rash of highway robberies, and the new government may
find its hinterland controlled by small bands of
rebels-turned-bandits.
   The thieving probably will increase if the rebels have to
continue living off ever more skeptical peasants.
   ``Ortega! Ortega! The weapons will not be handed over!'' was one
of the chants that greeted Daniel Ortega as he walked into a
baseball stadium for his last act as president _ turning over power
to Mrs. Chamorro.
   The chant by an unruly Sandinista crowd was a telling sign:
Weapons mean power for the Sandinista Front, which brooked little
opposition during its decade of rule after forging itself on the
premise of armed revolution.
   And as long as the Sandinista armed forces remain intact,
Nicaraguans _ long inured to dictatorships propped up by control of
the army _ understand that they retain the real power.
   That power is constitutionally vested in the executive office
but can rise against the president at any time. It is a lesson
deeply ingrained in Latin American politics.
   It also is something the Contras have warned about and
brandished as one more reason for their reluctance to disarm.
   UNO members also are angry over Gen. Ortega staying on.
   ``We campaigned throughout the countryside during the elections
without money, without anything,'' said Jaime Cuadra, explaining
Tuesday night at an UNO Cabinet meeting why he rejected his
appointment as agriculture minister.
   ``We told those peasants that once UNO won the elections, we
would get rid of all the Sandinistas. Now, how am I going to look
all those peasants if I take a post in the government and Humberto
is still there?''
   Cuadra is president of the Matagalpa Coffee Planters
Association, a group of 260 private farmers in Nicaragua's
heartland.
   He once was jailed by dictator Anastasio Somoza for smuggling
guns for the Sandinistas. Now he refuses to have anything to do
with them.
   Gilberto Cuadra, president of Nicaragua's most influential
private business group, the Superior Council of Private Enterprise,
also rejected his appointment as construction and transportation
minister.
   The men _ who are not related _ are influential, both inside the
country and among Nicaragua's exiles. While others were appointed
in their place Wednesday night, their dissatisfaction is bound to
find ready audiences.
   At a party celebrating the change of government, UNO revelers
chanted ``Humberto Must Go!''
   Vice President Virgilio Godoy, a strong Sandinista critic, was
at the party at the lakeside Plaza of the Revolution.
   Asked about Mrs. Chamorro's decision on Gen. Ortega, Godoy said:
``Tonight we're celebrating. We'll get back to work tomorrow.''

   President Chaim Herzog today invited right-wing
leader Yitzhak Shamir to try to form a new government after Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres failed to do so, officials said.
   The president's office said Peres informed Herzog he had been
unable to break a deadlock in the Knesset, or parliament, and
Herzog asked Shamir to come to his residence.
   ``I am unable to establish a government based on a majority, and
I am therefore returning the mandate,'' Peres said in a letter to
Herzog, according to a spokesman who demanded anonymity.
   It was the first time in Israel's 42-year history that a
candidate selected by the president has failed to form a government.
   The 66-year-old Peres was assigned the task of putting together
a new coalition five weeks ago after Shamir, leader of the
right-wing Likud bloc, lost a parliament vote of no confidence on
March 15.
   The vote was triggered by Peres' demand that Shamir accept U.S.
terms for convening Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo. Shamir
declined, saying he needed more time.
   Peres spent 35 days trying to forge an alliance that included
both ultra-Orthodox religious parties and small left-wing factions.
He gave up the effort only hours before a midnight (6 p.m. EDT)
deadline set by the president.
   Peres predicted Shamir also would fail to form a coalition in
the deadlocked parliament. But he warned that if Shamir succeeded,
he would create ``an extremist right-wing government the like of
which Israel never had.''
   In an earlier radio interview Thursday, Peres blamed the
opposition of leading rabbis for the failure of his effort.
   He said two small religious parties ``changed direction'' after
Rabbi Eliezer Shach, 96, condemned the secular groups that back
Labor .
   Peres indicated he had no chances left after a prospective Likud
defector, Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai, rejected Labor's
offers. His decision to stay with Likud left Peres with only 60
supporters in the 120-seat parliament.
   Israeli newspapers said intensive efforts were under way in
Likud to win back Avraham Sharir, a former tourism minister who
defected to Labor.
   Shamir will have 21 days to form a coalition and a possible
extension of an additional 21 days.
   Peres was given a 15-day extension on April 11 after his initial
21-day mandate expired.
   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Likud hoped to muster a majority
of 65 within several days. That majority would include extreme
right-wing factions and ultra-Orthodox religious parties.

<HEAD>Soviets Link Chemical Weapons Accord to Halt in U.S. Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators today ended their
latest round of talks on chemical weapons, and the Soviets said
there would be no accord on destroying stockpiles unless the United
States agrees to halt production.
   Both sides said, however, that they hoped a draft accord could
be signed at the Washington summit between Presidents Bush and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The agreement, already reached in principle, would reduce
superpower stockpiles to 5,000 tons each, following up on a
proposal first submitted by Bush in a speech to the U.N. General
Assembly last year.
   The United States says that by taking the lead in destruction,
the superpowers would give new impetus to the multilateral talks on
a chemical weapons ban in the 40-nation Geneva Conference on
Disarmament.
   U.S. chief negotiator Stephen Ledogar told the Geneva Conference
on Tuesday that such an accord would reduce the U.S. stockpile to
roughly 20 percent of the current level.
   It would mean that the U.S. total, never officially disclosed up
to now, would be about 25,000 to 30,000 tons. The Soviet Union has
announced it has 50,000 tons, a figure U.S. experts have said was
below the actual size.
   Speaking to reporters, Ledogar's Soviet counterpart, Serguei
Batsanov, said it was ``vital'' for Moscow that the bilateral
accord on destruction include a U.S. commitment to stop the
chemical weapons modernization program approved by Congress in 1985
after production had been suspended for 16 years. The Soviet Union
continued to build up its capability until 1987.
   Batsanov said continuation of U.S. production could force the
Soviet Union to reconsider its 1987 decision. Inclusion of a U.S.
commitment in the accord ``is a very important position for the
Soviet side,'' he said.
   ``It is a vital position,'' he added. ``I cannot imagine that we
would agree to any bilateral accord that would not include that
commitment.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Eviction Of Settlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld an eviction
order against 150 Jewish settlers who occupied a complex owned by
the Greek Orthodox Church in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem's
Old City.
   The settlers, who moved into St. John's Hospice on April 11,
must leave the 72-room complex near the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre by Tuesday, said Chief Justice Meir Shamgar, reading the
ruling by a three-judge panel.
   The judges said the Panama-based company, SBC, that subleased
St. John's Hospice to the settlers could keep up to 20 guards and
maintenance employees there until the tenancy dispute was settled
by a lower court.
   The Jewish settlement provoked deep anger among clerics and
Palestinians, both Christian and Moslem.The State Department called
the settlement, which came during Easter Week, ``an insensitive and
provocative act.''
   Adding to the anger was the admission by the government, after
repeated denials, that it had provided $1.8 million of the money
for the settlement. The admission brought protests from American
pro-Israeli and Jewish groups.
   During arguments today, the Justice Ministry contended that the
continued presence of the settlers would inflame Arabs and provoke
violence.
   ``Every event in the area has influence on the fabric of
relations, problematic these days, between members of different
religions and faiths,'' argued the ministry's representative, Nili
Arad.
   She told the three-justice panel that the settlement site ``is a
very sensitive place...both sides recognize there has been a
disturbance of the peace.''
   Avraham Socholovsky, an attorney for the Greek Orthodox Church
which owns the compound, accused the settlers of provocative
behavior. The group had entered the building with weapons, he said.
``It was like an occupation. Is this what they call subletting?.''
   The Old City, captured from Jordan during the 1967 Middle East
war, is divided into Moslem, Christian, Jewish and Armenian
quarters. Each group jealously guards its sector, which contains
holy sites and shrines, and the slighest changes in the status quo
have historically led to violence.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek said the settlement brought
``horrible damage to Jerusalem'' by heightening tensions between
the religious communities.
   In an unprecedented move, leaders of 10 major Christian sects
said they would close all Christian shrines in the Holy Land on
Friday in protest.
   City officials had said they hoped a Supreme Court decision
upholding the eviction orders would ease the tensions and prompt
Christian leaders to call off the demonstration.
   The eviction would be the first time that settlers have been
forced out of homes in occupied areas since April 1982, when the
army oversaw the evacuation of 300 settlers from Yamit in the Sinai
Desert. The Sinai was returned to Egypt under the 1979 peace treaty.
   The Jerusalem settlers claimed they had subleased the
four-building complex from an Armenian Christian tenant. The Greek
Orthodox Church contends the lease is illegal. Two lower courts
upheld the church's claim and ordered the Jews out.
   The settlers have argued they were upholding the rights of Jews
to live anywhere in Jerusalem.

   President Bush gave a warm welcome to
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez today, praising him for
restoring his country's economic health and for his struggle on
behalf of democracy in Nicaragua.
   ``This is a time to celebrate,'' said Bush noting that Perez had
come here after attending the inaugural Wednesday of Nicaraguan
President Violeta Chamorro.
   With the Venezuelan leader standing at his side during an
arrival ceremony on the White House south lawn, Bush said the
political evolution in Nicaragua came about in part because Perez's
``deep personal commitment to the advance of democracy never
wavered.''
   Discussing Perez's economic policies, Bush said they have
brought some pain to the Venezuelan people but at the same time
have laid the foundation for future growth.
   Perez, in turn, said that Latin American nations are determined
to modernize their institutions but complained that they don't
always get ``understanding and encouragement'' from the
industrialized democracies.
   He added that Latin America is now in a position to help shape a
world of ``peaceful neighborliness.''
   Perez was to be guest of honor tonight at a White House dinner
after his morning meeting with Bush and a luncheon hosted by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A senior U.S. official who briefed reporters Tuesday on
condition of anonymity said Perez has shown courage in sticking to
an austerity program in the face of enormous domestic opposition.
   ``It's a model for how a democracy can change an economy,'' the
official said, asserting that Perez virtually had to decree a
recession in order to get ``over the hump of economic reform.''
   Perez imposed his austerity program after riots erupted about
three months after he took office at the end of 1988. The U.S.
official said Perez is a far different president this time compared
with his initial term in office between 1974 and 1979 when he was
far more supportive of a dominant state role in the economy.
   His ``shock program,'' among other benefits, has improved export
performance and reduced inflation, the U.S. official said.
   The official said the short-term consequences of austerity are
serious in terms of unemployment but the medium- to long-term
effects are worse if nothing is done.
   ``If you do it right, if you make your country competitive, then
at one point ... you've got a country that's not only competitive,
the industries begin to work more efficiently and the standard of
living goes up,'' the official said.
   One example of creditor confidence in Perez's economic policies
was demonstrated last month when Venezuela and the banks that have
lent it money reached agreement in principle on reducing the
country's $20 billion debt to those banks.
   Final agreement is expected in July.
   Venezuela has an overall foreign debt of $37 billion, the fourth
largest in Latin America. It has fallen behind on interest and
principal payments in recent years.
   Perez will host a luncheon Friday in honor of the members of the
international banking community.

   Drug agents raided a suburban house after finding
400 pounds of cocaine in cars leaving the building, sparking a
shootout that left one suspect dead and an FBI agent slightly
wounded, police said today.
   After trying for more than five hours to negotiate with a man
believed holed up inside the suburban home, Metro-Dade police and
FBI agents moved inside this morning and found the man dead.
   Police initially said the Wednesday evening shootout involved an
arms deal, but spokesman Don Blocker said today that was incorrect,
that the incident involved drugs.
   The house had been under surveillance before the shooting.
   Early Wednesday evening, three men who left the home in one car
were arrested when they started unloading 286 pounds of cocaine at
another location. Later, a fourth man in another car was stopped
and 100 pounds of cocaine was found.
   The agents then obtained a search warrant and tried to enter the
house, said Metro-Dade spokeswoman Myriam Royle. Shots were fired
and an FBI agent was grazed by a bullet on his right side, she said.
   The agent, whose name was not released, was treated and released
at Jackson Memorial Hospital, said FBI spokesman Paul Miller.
   After the agent was shot, a Metro-Dade officer who was stationed
at the back of the house shot at a man who tried to flee. The man,
armed with an automatic weapon, fled back inside the house.
   Police cordoned off a 20-block area, made repeated attempts to
talk to anyone inside the house and lobbed tear gas shells inside
without response, police said.
   Five hours after the shooting, officers moved inside and found
the man dead. His name was not immediately released.
   The four men arrested on cocaine trafficking charges were Rene
Vasquez, 42, Luis Antonio Sastre, 69, Antonio Sastre, 28, and
Bernardo Maria Ahumada, 21.

<HEAD>Lithuania to Impose Some Food Rationing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian lawmakers decided today to impose food
rationing on May 1 as the rebellious republic continued to struggle
under an economic blockade that has reduced its supplies of fuel
and medicine.
   Lithuania widened efforts to circumvent sanctions imposed last
week by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who wants Lithuania
to rescind laws designed to implement its March 11 declaration of
independence.
   A Lithuanian delegation was due in the northern Russian city of
Leningrad on Friday to talk with local officials about a direct
exchange of goods either for hard currency or barter, a Leningrad
journalist said.
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene announced Wednesday that
Lithuania had halted its usual supplies of meat, milk and other
food products to the rest of the Soviet Union. She instead urged
Lithuania to settle its accounts with the republics ``almost in
marketplace conditions'' of bartering for other goods.
   Gorbachev, visiting the central Russian city of Sverdlovsk, was
asked by citizens why he had refused to open negotiations with the
Lithuanian leadership, the Soviet news agency Tass reported. He
replied that the Kremlin only negotiates with foreign governments,
not its own republics.
   Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the Lithuanian parliament, or
Supreme Council, said lawmakers decided to ration some food
products beginning May 1, although no details were released.
   Unlike most Soviet republics, Lithuania produces all the meat
and dairy goods it needs, so the rationing presumably would be of
those foodstuffs it does not produce, or of meat and milk products
earmarked for export.
   Gasoline already is being rationed in the republic of 3.8
million people, since Gorbachev cut off its oil and curtailed
natural gas deliveries by more than 80 percent. Individuals are
limited to 7.8 gallons of gasoline per month.
   The Supreme Council on Wednesday also endowed its Council of
Ministers with broad control over the economy and local governments
during the period of the embargo, Ms. Dapkus said.
   The powers include the ability to change supply plans, transfer
workers to different jobs, and use natural and financial resources
in a centralized manner, she said.
   Effects of the embargo mounted. Hospitals, running low on
medicine, discouraged all but emergency surgery, Radio Vilnius
reported. In addition, newspapers prepared to cut back the size of
their editions by as much as half.
   Prunskiene said Lithuania wanted to start immediate trade
negotiations with sympathetic groups in Moscow, Leningrad, the
oil-rich Tyumen region of Siberia and the Ukrainian city of Lvov,
according to Ms. Sinnig.
   Even if Lithuania struck such deals, however, transporting the
goods would be difficult, because Moscow controls the train, truck
routes and pipelines throughout the nation.
   The Kremlin began cutting off natural gas, oil and other
supplies to Lithuania one week ago, stepping up pressure on the
Baltic republic's leaders to reverse their drive for independence.
Lithuania, forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 along with
its sister republics of Latvia and Estonia, declared independence
on March 11.
   Lithuanian Deputy Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas estimated
the republic's oil reserves would last until May 20. The Soviet
Union is Lithuania's sole supplier of fuel.
   Other shortages of grain, sugar, salt and margarine have been
noted, and Soviet supplies of wood products also have been
reportedly cut off.

   Aerial pesticide spraying to attack an infestation
of Mediterranean fruit flies in one southern Florida county began
today after a three-hour delay caused by equipment problems.
   A helicopter loaded with syrupy insect bait spiked with the
pesticide malathion took off at midmorning for up to seven hours of
spraying over parts of Dade County, said Phyllis Habeck,
spokeswoman for the eradication task force in Miami.
   The helicopter had been airborne shortly after sunrise but
quickly returned after spray nozzles clogged, she said.
   Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner ordered the spraying in
Dade County to protect Florida's $1.4 billion citrus industry.
   In Southern California, which is also waging a battle against
the pest, a federal judge ruled Wednesday that malathion spraying
to eradicate the Medfly does not violate environmental, aviation or
pesticide laws.
   U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler said the cities of Azusa
and Alhambra, which sued to stop the spraying, should have sought
action instead by the Federal Aviation Administration or the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Deputy Attorney General Charles Getz said the Medfly infestation
was declared a state emergency, thus eliminating any need for
approval from the cities.
   In Florida, the spraying that began this morning was to cover a
16-square-mile area near Miami International Airport. In about a
month, millions of sterile Medflies will be released to foul up the
pest's breeding cyle.
   The target area will be covered with pesticide in a
concentration of 2.4 ounces, or about three tablespoons, of
malathion per acre. That compares with 3.1 ounces of malathion per
acre routinely sprayed throughout Florida to control mosquitoes.
   The female Medfly found Tuesday in a Port Everglades back yard
trap brought to 10 the number of Medflies discovered in South
Florida in as many days.
   Officials were hopeful that the Medfly in Broward County, just
north of Dade, did not signal an outbreak but was ``a lone
hitchhiker.'' The other Medflies were found in Dade County.
   There are no plans to spray Broward County, said Habeck of the
eradication task force.
   A quarantine went into effect Wednesday for an estimated
100-square-mile area, including parts of Miami Springs, Hialeah and
sections of unincorporated Miami. The quarantine means most produce
won't be allowed out of the area until inspected.
   Medflies could strike a harsh blow to Florida's citrus industry,
which was crippled by a Christmas freeze. Medfly larvae hatch
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables, turning
them into mush.
   Environmentalists in California and here have objected to use of
malathion, contending too little is known about the chemical's
long-term health effects.
   In Southern California, where the Medfly has spread into orange
and grapefruit groves in some of the region's richest farmland,
aerial spraying of malathion in suburban neighborhoods has caused
an uproar.
   Following the court ruling Wednesday, attorneys for Azusa and
Alhambra said they would seek a court order forcing the FAA to
prohibit the helicopter sprayings, which have occurred on almost a
nightly basis over more than 400 square miles in Southern
California since July.

   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East
Germany called on his countrymen today to stop complaining that a
proposed monetary union with West Germany treats them unfairly.
   De Maiziere's comments in Parliament followed agreement on a
basic 1-1 exchange rate of the strong West German mark for the
faltering East German currency for wages, pensions and savings up
to $2,300.
   East Germans across the country have rushed to their banks to
withdraw savings above that level, which would be exchanged at two
East marks for one West mark under the proposal.
   De Maiziere's government is trying to raise the 1-1 exchange
level above the $2,300 limit, and he said his countrymen should
keep their money in the bank until the issue has been resolved.
   ``We have already made achievements in that area, considering
there is now a willingness to exchange wages at 1-1 in a country
where until now there was a rate of 1-4.65 _ not to mention the
black market rates,'' he said.
   Black market exchange rates shortly before the country's first
free elections March 18 were as high as eight East marks for one
West German mark.
   Commenting on charges that the monetary proposal makes East
Germans second-class citizens, de Maiziere said: ``Until now we
have been third or fourth class.''
   De Maiziere refused to discuss monetary union in detail, saying
it could disturb negotiations between the two Germanys that began
Wednesday.
   About 1,000 farmers and foresters gathered outside the
Parliament building to demand protective measures after
unification, fearful of how they will fare in a market economy when
some state subsidies are scrapped. A delegation of protesters met
briefly with Agricultural Minister Peter Pollack.
   In Bonn, the leader of West Germany's central bank today said he
could not rule out a tax increase to finance unification with East
Germany.
   ``We cannot simply discount a tax increase out of hand,''
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Pohl told a banking conference in
Bonn, but he added that all other options for financing the union
would be tried first.
   A target date of July 2 has been set for monetary, economic and
social union between the two Germanys.
   Political union is to take place after all-German elections,
which West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl would like to see by the
end of 1991.

   Nuclear-generated electricity produced by
the long-delayed, $6.5 billion Seabrook nuclear power plant will
flow to consumers briefly this weekend for the first time, plant
officials said.
   Workers are expected to open valves directing steam to the
plant's huge turbine-generator when the plant reaches about 10
percent of its operating capacity, said Edward Brown, president of
New Hampshire Yankee.
   The plant has generated electricity briefly before, but with
steam generated by the friction of water rushing through a piping
system, not from nuclear power.
   The plant has been conducting tests and operating at low power
since receiving its federal operating license last month after a
years-long battle with critics who questioned its safety. The
reactor previously was taken to 10 percent power without generating
electricity.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher said today that the electricity will
flow into the New England power network. He said the generation
would last for a few minutes, and then longer periods would follow,
perhaps also during the weekend.

   New York's top court today awarded the
America's Cup to the San Diego Yacht Club, ruling that the club
legally won yacht racing's most coveted prize and that
sportsmanship was none of the court's business to decide.
   Possession of the trophy, which was fought for as hard in the
courts as on the water, is worth millions of dollars to the host
community during cup defenses.
   The 5-2 ruling by New York's Court of Appeals ends a legal
battle for the 139-year-old silver trophy that began even before
the San Diego Yacht Club's speedy catamaran trounced the huge
single-hulled yacht from New Zealand's Mercury Bay Club in
September 1988.
   ``The question of whether particular conduct is `sporting' or
`fair' ... is wholly distinct from the question of whether it is
legal,'' said Judge Fritz Alexander, writing for the court majority.
   According to the America's Cup Deed of Trust, a 19th century
document, the New York Court of Appeals is the final arbiter of cup
disputes.
   Challenger Michael Fay, in a statement this morning from
Auckland, New Zealand, said ``the ruling is final and we accept
it.'' He said he looked forward to another race in 1992.
   The catamaran Stars and Stripes, with Dennis Conner captain,
easily defeated Mercury Bay's yacht New Zealand in two match races
in the Pacific Ocean just off San Diego in 1988.
   The legal battle had begun the previous year. In February 1987,
Conner's San Diego club had won the cup back from Australia,
avenging a loss four years earlier when the Aussies became the
first racers from outside the United States to take possession of
the cup.
   Then, five months later, Fay issued an unwelcome challenge to
the San Diegans, calling for a radical departure from the
traditional America's Cup format. He wanted the race held in 1988
instead of waiting four years until 1991, and he wanted to use a
boat roughly twice the size as the 12-meter yachts that had been in
use in recent years.
   San Diego rejected the challenge but lost in the first round of
court battles. The club then made a countermove, deciding to use a
twin-hulled catameran, which is far faster and more manueverable
that a large single-hulled yacht. That led to the one-sided victory
in the race in 1988 that was upheld today.
   Fay had complained that by using the catamaran, San Diego made a
farce of the race and broke rules of sportsmanship.
   In fact, the disparity between the two crafts was so large that
Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, during court arguments in February, said
racing a monohull against a catamaran was ``like putting a New York
City bus against a Ferrari.''
   While there have been disputes over the America's Cup in the
past, this was the first to reach New York's highest court.
   Lower state courts had split on the question of who deserved the
cup. In March 1989, state Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick
disqualified Conner and awarded the trophy to Mercury Bay. But a
midlevel New York appeals court reversed that decision in September
and returned the trophy to San Diego.
   In a 31-page dissent to today's opionion, Judge Stewart Hancock
Jr. said that San Diego had a higher obligation to attempt to make
the race a fair match because the yacht club was the defender of
the cup and therefore its trustee.

   The building that housed the
McMartin preschool, scene of child abuse charges leading to the
longest criminal trial in U.S. history, has been purchased by a
developer who wants to tear it down.
   ``Who needs that monument anymore?'' said Arnold Goldstein, a
real estate broker who bought the property from Danny Davis, the
lawyer for McMartin defendant Raymond Buckey.
   Goldstein said Wednesday he wants to build a three-story office
building. He paid Davis $320,000 for the school on Feb. 6, Los
Angeles County records show. Davis said he acquired the property in
lieu of a legal fee.
   The McMartin case began in 1983 when a parent told police that
her child had been molested at the preschool. Other parents echoed
the allegations.
   In January, after court proceedings that lasted more than five
years, a jury acquitted Peggy McMartin Buckey. Her son was
acquitted of all but 13 counts. He is being retried on some counts.
   Manhattan Beach is a seaside suburb about 20 miles southwest of
downtown Los Angeles.

   One of nine people injured in an explosion
at an aluminum recycling plant died today, and the plant manager
suggested that a foreign material in the scrap metal caused the
explosion.
   The explosion Wednesday at the Culp Smelting and Refining Co.
occurred just after workers put a compressed bundle of aluminum
into the main furnace, said plant manager Bob Pine.
   The bales of industrial aluminum sheets are melted into ingots
to be used in manufacturing automobiles and other products.
   ``There appeared to be some foreign item of material that was in
with scrap aluminum,'' he said, but he added that he could only
speculate about the possible cause of the blast.
   Pine said Wednesday's blast followed a smaller explosion Tuesday
night in the same smelting area that injured one worker and other,
less serious blasts. He said an investigation was under way to
determine the supplier of the aluminum bundle.
   John Hall of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
which has begun an investigation, said that such a blast could
occur if scrap material containing water was lowered into the
furnace.
   ``Anything could get into the metal,'' he said. He said it is
too early to tell exactly what caused the blast and that that it
might take OSHA several weeks to make a determination.
   The explosion, which was felt 10 miles away in Rainbow City,
blew apart the furnace and part of the building.
   One of those injured, Jeffrey Howell, 23, of Gadsden, died today
at University Hospital at Birmingham. Hospital spokesman Hank Black
said Howell was burned over 90 percent of his body.
   Two other workers remained in intensive care but their condition
was upgraded from critical to serious, Black said. Six other
employees were treated and released for minor injuries.
   Culp Smelting employs 100 people and handles 6 million pounds of
scrap aluminum a month.

   Eton College, the breeding ground of the British
establishment, has bowed to modern times by allowing the youths to
go into town wearing jeans and open-necked shirts.
   But if they look scruffy the concession may be withdrawn,
headmaster Eric Anderson ruled.
   Until now, the exclusive 550-year-old prep school west of London
required boys crossing the single bridge into the neighboring town
of Windsor to wear dress trousers, jackets and ties.
   The change was recommended by a committee of teachers and senior
pupils, said a statement issued Thursday.
   ``We try to keep a balance between comfort and looking
respectable. If the more informal rules for Windsor result in
scruffiness, we shall review them again,'' Anderson said.
   ``But I suppose you could say that we want to retain our
traditional uniform at work but to be in tune with the times when
relaxing.''
   Eton has 1,260 pupils, all boys. The statement said there was no
change in the rule requiring boys to wear tail coats and striped
trousers in the classroom.

   Hundreds of poor women and children
stampeded to reach a building where free clothes were being
distributed Thursday, and police said at least 34 people were
killed and 20 injured in the crush.
   About 8,000 people had gathered at a factory in the southern
port city of Chittagong for the giveaway, said police officials
reached by telephone from Dhaka.
   It was organized to mark the end of the Moslem holy month of
Ramadan.
   People broke open the steel gate of the factory and began
running down a narrow passageway to reach the building where the
clothes were being given out, police said. Many people were
trampled after they tripped and fell, police said.
   A senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, blamed
the stampede on ``mismanagement'' and said the incident would be
investigated.
   Bangladesh, a predominantly Moslem nation, is one of the world's
poorest. The average income among its 110 million people is $160
per year.

<DATELINE>OLONGAPO, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. sailor began serving a
60-day sentence Thursday for injuring and insulting two Filipino
reporters in what officials said was the first case of an American
serviceman being jailed here.
   Prosecutor Dorentino Floresta said Michael Carpaneto, a crewman
on the USS Midway, was taken to the Olongapo city jail three weeks
after a court convicted him of the charges. No hometown was given
for the 27-year-old sailor.
   Olongapo is the home of the U.S. Navy's Subic Bay base. Floresta
said that since 1980, 95 percent of the complaints lodged against
U.S. military personnel in Olongapo were dismissed before reaching
trial.
   Of those cases that went to trial, only 1 percent ended in
conviction. In those cases, Americans opted to serve sentences in
the U.S. Navy brig or were sent out of the country, the prosecutor
said. ``This is unprecedented,'' Floresta said of Carpaneto's case.
   Subic Bay is among six U.S. military installations in the
Philippines on a lease that expires in September 1991. Manila and
Washington are to begin talks in May on whether to extend the
agreement.
   Opponents of the bases have complained that U.S. personnel
involved in crimes against Filipinos escape prosecution or arrest
because American authorities intercede on their behalf.
   Carpaneto was accused of punching and shouting profanities at
two Filipino reporters during an altercation last year. The two
Filipinos refused a $50 out-of-court settlement and hired a lawyer
to pursue the case.
   After nearly a year's delay, Carpaneto was convicted April 4. He
was sentenced to 60 days in jail and ordered to pay damages of more
than $1,700 to the plaintiffs.

   A hospital has suggested that top
Communist Party and government officials be prosecuted for failing
to take measures to reduce the impact of the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster, a newspaper said Thursday.
   The daily Mlada Fronta said the proposal was made by the staff
of a hospital in Novy Jicin, 156 miles southeast of Prague.
   The newspaper also published an open letter by the daily's
editor in chief, Libor Sevcik, to prosecutors. He accused
authorities of official silence and inaction in the wake of the
Chernobyl accident, which occurred one year ago Thursday.
   ``Unknown offenders have exposed several million inhabitants of
this country to danger by not fulfilling their duties ... and by
doing nothing ... to protect the lives and health of the
inhabitants,'' the letter said.
   Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of the four
reactors at the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Ukraine caught fire
and exploded April 26, 1986. Unofficial reports say 250 people died
as a result of the accident.
   The blast spewed cesium, strontium and plutonium over a wide
area and sent a cloud of radioactive gas around the world.
   After the catastrophe, Czechoslovak authorities failed to warn
people about possible dangers.
   ``While all top representatives of the ruling Communist Party
were informed and were eating clean food imported from abroad for
hard currency, the uninformed mothers were exposing their infants
to the danger of the radioactive fallout, feeding them contaminated
food,'' the letter said.
   Meanwhile, at Temelin in south Bohemia, activists of the
Greenpeace environmentalist movement scaled a cooling tower at a
nuclear power station under construction and pinned up a banner
saying ``Stop CSFRnobyl _Greenpeace.''
   CSFR is the abbreviation of Czechoslovakia's official name _ the
Czech and Slovak Federative Republic.
   A Greenpeace press release made available in Vienna said 13
Greenpeace climbers left the cooling tower ``exhausted but
satisfied.'' It said police took the protesters' ID cards but did
not otherwise intervene.

   The French fur industry is fighting back against
slumping sales, a series of warm winters and an international
animal rights campaign waged by conservation groups, celebrities
and others.
   Two top fashion houses, Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior,
staged shows Wednesday and Thursday to present their new fur styles
for the 1990s.
   The shows featured younger, sportier styles _ putting
old-fashioned minks into the closet and bringing out swirly, light
looks, blousons and fur-lined luxury cashmere, taffeta or poplin
styles.
   The shows came amid a growing movement against furs in the
United States and Europe. The industry's most visible setback was
the closing in February of the fur salon at London's giant Harrods
department store. It said sales had dropped more than 40 percent in
the past four years.
   Some of the new styles seemed to anticipate the hostility that
has been directed at fur wearers.
   Dior designer Gianfranco Ferre ``hid'' some of the furs in his
garments, making furs reversible, dying them or disguising them to
look like fabric.
   His new angle on astrakhan came out in blazers patterned to look
like chevron tweed. But the ``disguised'' fur outfits don't come
cheaply. Even though featured in the boutique rather than the haute
couture line, a blazer will sell for nearly $4,000.
   Dior's show was grouped under either boutique (luxury
ready-to-wear) or haute couture categories. Both were designed by
Ferre, who said: ``It's wonderful to work with such fabulous furs.''
   These included minks and sables, de-colored and dyed in shades
of gold or caramel. The boutique collection had a younger look,
featuring trendy duffels, lamb-lined moire trench coats or blouson
jackets with big collars _ one model dyed red, tied by a moire
taffeta bow at the waist.
   Ferre had fun using his favorite organzas and chiffons as bows
at waists and necks underneath or topping the furs.
   One of Ferre's favorite shapes was a terrific short, full
pyramid, also appearing in shortie jackets.
   Saint Laurent's fur collection was designed by Robert Merloz,
who has been at the house since graduating four years ago from the
Paris Chambre Syndicale couture school.
   Merloz presented garments that included soft trapeze or shortie
trench coats in moire, poplin or taffeta, lined in lamb or mink.
   He used plenty of curly Persian lamb touches, putting wavy
piping on ``nappa'' leather coats with bold heart-shaped buttons,
or contrasting dark gray lapels and cuffs on swirly little white
beaver short coats.
   Merloz also draped chinchilla, sable or mink coats with ribbons
over lace and satin dresses.
   Taking a bow after the show, the Parisian-born Merloz, 25, wiped
away tears of relief and happiness.
   ``I was trying to give furs a lighter, more supple and yet full
look,'' he said.
   Will Merloz be the successor to Yves Saint Laurent? At 53, Saint
Laurent is often ailing and rumors are flying about his possible
retirement.
   Following a nervous collapse just before his last ready-to-wear
collection, Saint Laurent was hospitalized and missed the show.
According to associates, he is resting outside of Paris and plans
to begin work again in June.
   Pierre Berge, chairman of the Saint Laurent empire, declined to
discuss a possible successor. But when asked if Saint Laurent would
be designing the winter couture collection to come out in July, he
exclaimed: ``I certainly hope so!''

   This time, it really is the end of the line. ``A
Chorus Line,'' Broadway's longest running show, plays its 6,137th _
and final _ performance Saturday night.
   The evening, a benefit for the New York Shakespeare Festival,
has a top ticket price of $500, and the 1,483-seat Shubert Theater
has been sold out for weeks. The last performance promises to be an
event, especially with most of the original cast in the audience,
and possibly on stage at the finale. And it will be a celebration
and remembrance of Michael Bennett, the man behind the musical, who
died of AIDS in 1987 at age 44.
   ``In a funny way, we all felt the show wasn't going to close,''
said Tom Porter, who probably has seen the Broadway production more
than anybody. ``But now, we're beginning to realize it certainly is
going to happen, and I'll miss it. When the show closes, there
won't be a Michael Bennett musical on Broadway.''
   Porter, the musical's production stage manager, has been with
``A Chorus Line'' for more than 12 years, first with the Chicago
company for eight months and then in New York. From a spot in the
back of the house or by watching a television monitor in his
backstage office, he keeps an eye on each performance.
   ``A Chorus Line'' tells the stories of 17 dancers who compete
for eight roles in a big Broadway musical. It was Bennett's baby,
born out of more than 40 hours of taped conversations by Broadway
dancers who talked about their lives, loves, hopes and fears.
   During an extended series of workshops at the New York
Shakespeare Festival, Bennett conceived the show, hiring Nicholas
Dante and James Kirkwood to fashion the book from the tapes, Marvin
Hamlisch to write the music and Ed Kleban the lyrics.
   The show, which arrived at the Shubert on July 25, 1975, after
performances at the Shakespeare Festival off-Broadway, was an
immediate hit. More than 6.5 million people have paid $150 million
to see the musical on Broadway. The show, which also has been
performed in more than 20 countries, has made $38 million in net
profit for the festival.
   But grosses have been dwindling, and the show incurred heavy
losses last January. Joseph Papp, head of the Shakespeare Festival,
announced Feb. 21 that the show would end its 15-year run the
following month. It set off a box-office stampede, with grosses
doubling to nearly $400,000 a week. The original closing date,
March 31, was extended by four weeks.
   The extension enabled the show to do a special benefit on April
8, Bennett's birthday, which raised more than $50,000 for ``Equity
Fights AIDS.''
   ``It was an emotional night,'' Porter recalled. ``The dancers
went back to their dressing rooms, changed their clothes and the
audience was still on its feet, applauding.''
   In the weeks since Papp announced the closing, the news media
have descended on the Shubert.
   ``I think we started outdoing the Statue of Liberty in terms of
visitors,'' said Porter.
   Television crews, some from as far away as Sweden and Japan,
were nightly visitors. Original cast members sang and cried on Phil
Donahue's and Geraldo Rivera's TV talk shows. Current performers in
the show were profiled on ``Nightline'' with Ted Koppel.
   The musical spawned four books in the last year, including a
biography of Bennett by Boston Globe theater critic Kevin Kelly and
``On the Line,'' remembrances by members of the original cast.
   According to Ken Mandelbaum, author of ```A Chorus Line' and the
Musicals of Michael Bennett,'' the musical's main legacy is the way
it was put together through the workshops.
   ``From then on, almost every musical that got to Broadway went
through some form of workshop,'' Mandelbaum said. ``When the
workshop of `A Chorus Line' started, there was no script really and
no songs. They went into rehearsal to create the show.''
   Today, he added, most directors and producers of musicals don't
use workshops as effectively as Bennett did. They use them mostly
as additional auditions or as extra rehearsals.
   ```A Chorus Line' also represents Broadway in a way that
probably no other show did,'' Mandelbaum added. ``No other musical
was so about Broadway. And as it traveled around the country,
people really got that feeling.''

<HEAD>Mongolian President to Visit China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's president will visit China next month
and formally end decades of strained relations between the Asian
neighbors, the Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.
   President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat will tour China from May 4-9.
He will be the first Mongolian head of government to visit China
since 1962, the ministry said.
   Ochirbat became chairman of the Grand People's Hural, or
parliament, last month in changes that resulted from weeks of
protests for democratic reforms.
   The reforms promised by Mongolia's new leaders reportedly worry
the conservative Beijing government, and Mongolian sources say
China has stepped up surveillance of its Mongol minority in Inner
Mongolia.
   In China, Ochirbat will be seeking greater economic exchanges, a
relaxation of border tensions and access to a Chinese port as a
transit point for Mongolian trade.
   China and Mongolia have often been opponents in war, with
Genghis Khan's successors ruling China for a century and China
later occupying Mongolia.
   The Mongolians were allied with the Soviet Union in gaining
independence and establishing the world's second Communist state in
1921. Inner Mongolia, with a heavy Chinese presence, stayed under
Beijing's rule.
   China did not recognize Mongolian independence until the Chinese
communists came to power in 1949.
   China and Mongolia maintained good relations in the 1950s, but
Mongolia joined its patron state, the Soviet Union, in splitting
with China in the early 1960s. Relations began to thaw as the
Soviet Union and China patched up their differences in recent years.

<HEAD>Government Vows Crackdown on Labor; Riot Police Surround Shipyard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By C. W. LIM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government vowed Thursday to crack
down on a growing wave of labor unrest, and thousands of riot
police surrounded the country's largest shipyard, where striking
workers have put up barricades.
   The government's action came a day after thousands of workers at
the shipyard of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. went on strike. Labor
protests also continued at the state-run KBS television and radio
network.
   The government issued a statement Thursday vowing to act firmly
against illegal labor protests. It warned that, if unchecked, the
protests would increase social unrest and hurt South Korea's
sluggish economy.
   ``The government has decided to take strong countermeasures
against spreading, unlawful labor strikes,'' the statement said.
   The warning came after an emergency meeting of economic and law
enforcement Cabinet ministers presided over by Prime Minister Kang
Young-hoon to discuss the labor unrest, which mainly involves
political issues.
   The warning did not specify what measures the government would
take, but there were strong indications of possible police action.
   Police were on increased alert after militant unions in other
major industrial centers threatened protest actions in support of
the striking shipyard workers.
   In the southern industrial city of Changwon, thousands of
workers rallied at a dozen companies, threatening to begin a
general strike if police moved into the Hyundai shipyard.
   Militant unions affiliated with the dissident National Labor
Federation said they would stage a nationwide support strike on May
Day. Radical leaders urged students to support striking workers.
   Police reinforcements were rushed to the Hyundai shipyard in the
coastal city of Ulsan, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul,
government officials said.
   No official figures were given, but newspaper reports said up to
12,000 riot police gathered near the shipyard. Police brought in
bulldozers, helicopters and fire trucks, newspapers said.
   Witnesses said shipyard workers had pitched 200 tents and put up
iron barricades at the main gate and other strategic points. They
also said workers had stacked steel bits, stones and firebombs in
anticipation of a police attack.
   In March 1989, riot police launched an air, sea and land attack
on the shipyard that ended a violent three-month labor protest. The
dispute began when workers broke away from a company-sanctioned
union and set up a separate union to demand better pay and working
conditions.
   The latest strike broke out just days before wage negotiations
were to begin. But union leaders said the dispute was not over
wages.
   They said the shipyard workers were demanding the release of
four union leaders who were jailed earlier this year for labor
protests, and the dropping of criminal charges against three
fugitive union activists involved in last year's strike.
   Government officials said the shipyard strike is illegal because
workers did not go through the required legal steps, including a
cooling-off period.
   Union leaders say the complexity of labor laws make it virtually
impossible to stage a legal strike.
   About 20,000 of the shipyard's 24,000 employees are members of
the union, but union leaders said the number of workers
participating in the strike had dropped to 12,000 since police
surrounded the shipyard.
   In another development, more than 1,500 KBS workers staged a
sit-down protest in the lobby of the network's Seoul headquarters
to press their demands that their new president resign. Theey
contend the new network head, Suh Ki-Won, is pro-government and
anti-reform.
   KBS workers have staged daily protests involving up to 4,000
people for the past two weeks.
   The network's three television channels and five radio stations
have been crippled by the dispute, broadcasting old movies,
shortened news casts, documentaries and music.
   At Hyundai Motor Co. in Ulsan, the nation's largest car maker,
union leaders said Thursday they would go on strike May 10 to press
their demand for an 18.9 percent wage hike.

<HEAD>Government Files Rebellion Raps Against Marcos Lawyer, Two Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government filed rebellion with
murder charges Thursday against a lawyer of the late President
Ferdinand Marcos, a former press officer and a journalist in
connection with the December coup attempt.
   Aurelio Trampe, senior state prosecutor of the Department of
Justice, said charges were filed against attorney Rafael Recto;
former presidential broadcast bureau chief Lito Gorospe; and
free-lance journalist Cecillo Arillo.
   Trampe said the three were charged with joining mutineers Dec. 1
in taking over the government television station in suburban Quezon
City.
   He quoted witnesses as saying Recto, who represents Marcos and
his family in civil cases here, was seen entering the station's
building with rebel soldiers to inquire where a press conference
would be held.
   Gorospe and Arillo were seen trying to reactivate the station's
television transmitter in an apparent attempt to broadcast rebel
propaganda, Trampe said.
   ``We think there is probable cause, that's why we filed the
charges,'' Trampe said in a telephone interview. ``The government
television station was clearly in rebel hands at the start of the
coup, and yet they were there.''
   ``They should explain their presence (at the station) ,'' Trampe
added.
   Judge Tirso Velasco, who is hearing the case, immediately
ordered the arrest of the three. No bail was recommended.
   The December coup, the sixth and most serious attempt to oust
President Corazon Aquino, left at least 113 people dead and more
than 600 injured.

   Phil Donahue, who earlier this year had talk
show host Joan Rivers as a guest on his show, will be her guest
Monday on the first live version of ``The Joan Rivers Show,'' a
Rivers spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Since its September debut, Rivers' syndicated series, carried by
146 stations, has been taped for broadcast two weeks after taping.
   Starting Monday, it will be sent live to stations at 9 a.m. EDT
each weekday, said spokeswoman Linda Lipman.
   The stations have the option of broadcasting each show live, or
taping it for broadcast on a same-day or next-day basis, Lipman
said.
   The appearances of Donahue and Rivers on each other's shows
continues a trend of recent months in which talk show hosts and

Barbara Walters' interview last month of NBC ``Today'' co-host
Bryant Gumbel on ABC's ``20-20.''

<HEAD>NATO May Declare End to Lance Missile Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the new atmosphere of reduced
East-West tensions, the NATO alliance may end controversial plans
to add a new short-range missile to its nuclear arsenal, sources
said Thursday.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization also could decide in the
coming months to make cuts in its stockpile of nuclear artillery,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``There's a possibility that there could be an announcement of
unilateral reductions of (those arms),'' said one source.
   A diplomat said ``it's a near certainty'' that the allies will
agree to end the nuclear missile project and to trim their
battlefield nuclear artillery.
   ``All these things are being discussed right now,'' said another
diplomat. ``Short-range nuclear forces is very much a hot subject.''
   The sources emphasized that no final decisions have been made.
   U.S. officials said in Washington last week that the Bush
administration was postponing indefinitely the development of new
short-range nuclear missiles that were to be based in West Germany.
   NATO's defense ministers meet May 9-10 in Canada to discuss the
West's future nuclear posture at a time of tremendous change in
East European countries, once considered adversaries.
   Aides to the defense ministers meet Friday in Brussels to
discuss nuclear issues in advance of the Canada meeting.
   In recent months, NATO diplomats have said there was dwindling
support for the U.S. plan to develop a new, more powerful
generation of short-range nuclear missiles. It would replace the
aging Lance surface-to-surface missile.
   One source said there was ``a possibility'' the defense
ministers at their Canada meeting would declare the project dead.
Another said it was unlikely. A third said he had not seen any
draft statements making such a reference.
   There is strong opposition to the new weapon in West Germany.
That is where most of the missiles would be based.
   The Lance was introduced in 1972, and military analysts say it
will become obsolete in 1995. Its maximum range is about 75 miles.
   Its replacement would be designed to hit a target more than 250
miles away, just under the limits of the 1987 Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces treaty.
   At a summit last May, President Bush and other NATO leaders
agreed to delay until 1992 the decision on deploying the new weapon.
   The decision was part of a summit compomise that linked
reductions in conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons to the start of
negotiations on clipping short-range nuclear forces.
   Germany had demanded immediate negotiations with the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact on slashing nuclear weapons. U.S. and British officials
wanted attention focused first on negotiations in Vienna to reduce
conventional arms.
   Negotiators want to wrap up a conventional arms accord by the
end of this year. Once a treaty is signed, officials say the two
sides could quickly enter into bargaining on reducing battlefield
nuclear weapons.
   In Vienna, U.S. and Soviet negotiators said petty bargaining was
slowing the talks on troop reductions.
   The talks began in March 1989 with the goal of reaching an
accord before the end of 1990.
   The superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195,000 troops each
in Central Europe, with the United States able to keep up to 30,000
troops elsewhere in Europe.
   However, the negotiations have been bogged down in definitions
of weapons categories. The two sides also disagree on the number of
combat aircraft each side should have.
   NATO has proposed a ceiling of 4,700 aircraft for each side,
with an additional 500 air defense interceptors, but the East would
like a higher ceiling.

   Alluring eyes and a sunny smile are not enough.
If you want to find an attractive face, a new high-tech study
suggests, look for one that is basically average.
   ``Averageness is probably a necessary condition for
attractiveness,'' said researcher Judith Langlois of the University
of Texas at Austin.
   The bad news for ordinary Joes and Janes is that, as Langlois
put it, there are ``probably not that many faces that are exactly
average'' in the way she studied.
   Langlois and a colleague used a computer to construct faces that
blended facial features of up to 32 people, averaging out such
features as nose length and chin prominence. In this way, the more
faces that went into a composite, the more it represented an
average face for the population of college-age students from which
it was drawn.
   When other students judged the attractiveness of the composites
and of individual faces, without being told which was which, they
found the composites made from 16 or 32 faces to be more attractive
than the real faces that went into them. And the more faces went
into a composite, the more attractive it became.
   Although other factors probably make movie stars unusually
handsome or beautiful, ``I'll bet their faces have the fundamental
attribute of averageness,'' Langlois said Wednesday. ``And without
that they would not be very attractive.''
   ``We don't know yet about all the other components of
attractiveness, but I would say this is a major one, and it's a
required one.''
   Langlois presents the study in the March issue of the journal
Psychological Science with Lori Roggman, who is now at the
University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
   ``I think the research is absolutely fascinating,'' commented
University of Minnesota psychologist Ellen Berscheid.
   ``I would say this is about the first time anyone has even begun
to unravel what the standards of beauty are,'' she said.
   But she cautioned that the experiment involved faces of white
college-age students, and said similar work must be tried with
faces from other racial and age groups to see if the results still
apply.
   If the principle does apply generally, Langlois said, it might
help dentists and surgeons in reconstructing faces shattered by
accidents or disfigured by abnormalities. The average face for a
person of the patient's age and race could be used as a guide for
the reconstruction, she said.
   Langlois said the appeal of an average face might be explained
by evolution. Individuals best exhibiting the central tendencies of
a population might be preferred for mating because their genes
might be less likely to contain harmful mutations, she suggested.
   Another possible explanation is that, in a sense, average faces
might be the most face-like. If humans evolved to respond to faces
to get social information, they may respond most strongly to the
most face-like faces they see, the researchers wrote.
   Previous studies show that even infants prefer faces that adults
consider more attractive, Langlois said.
   The new study used faces of 192 undergraduate psychology
students at the Texas university, plus the composites. For each
sex, a computer built composite photos that blended two, four,
eight, 16 or 32 faces.
   Attractiveness was judged by a different group of 300 students
using a scale of one to five, with five being the most attractive.
   Male individual faces averaged a rating of 2.51, compared with
3.27 for composites of 32 male faces. For females, individual faces
averaged 2.43, compared with 3.25 for 32-face composites.

<HEAD>Economy Stronger in Early 1990 but Will it Last?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unexpected strength in the U.S. economy has
led many analysts to double their estimates of growth for the first
part of the year, some pegging it as high as 3 percent rather than
the puny 1 percent they thought earlier.
   But some economists, noting continued high interest rates as
well as the warm weather and other special factors pushing growth
so far this year, say the pace cannot be sustained.
   And inflation, running hotter than expected, is also a worry.
   The gross national product _ the nation's output of goods and
services _ grew 3 percent in 1989 but had slowed to a rate of 1.1
percent in the final quarter of the year. The figures for the first
three months of 1990 will be released Friday.
   Where many private economists had predicted growth of between 1
percent and 1.5 percent for the January-March period, they now
foresee an increase between 2 percent and 2.5 percent. Some believe
it could be as high as 3 percent.
   While opinions differ on the growth rate during the rest of this
year, there is virtual unanimity that the Federal Reserve has
achieved its ``soft landing'' _ slowing the economy without tipping
it into a recession.
   But the central bank so far has not been able to achieve the
goal that made it want to slow things down in the first place:
Holding back price increases. Inflation rose from 4.6 percent in
1989 to an annual rate of 8.5 percent in the first quarter of 1990
as measured by the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index.
   The weather that helped propel business growth also pushed up
prices, especially for food and energy, although they have since
moderated.
   At the same time, the stronger economy created about 726,000
jobs during the first three months of 1990, driving unemployment
down to 5.2 percent, its lowest rate in a year.
   Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser at the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said his forecasting service has changed its
first-quarter growth prediction from between 1 percent and 1.5
percent in late December to 2.5 percent now.
   ``And it actually wouldn't surprise me if it is higher than
that,'' he told a reporter.
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago, also said in an interview that first-quarter GNP will
show a 2.5 percent gain, up from his 1 percent forecast in January.
   ``If it's outside the 2-2.5 percent range, it most likely will
be on the up side rather than the down side,'' he added.
   Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics, a Washington forecasting
service, also predicted a 2.5 percent growth rate and is ``looking
for a pretty solid growth rate, probably 3 percent or a little
higher, for the remaining three quarters of the year.''
   Chimerine, on the other hand, says he is reluctant to conclude
that the economy is picking up steam for the long run.
   ``Some of what we're getting in the first quarter is
temporary,'' he contended, saying that growth will advance only 1.8
percent or 1.9 percent for the year.
   ``A lot of people are ignoring the fact that over the last four
months, long-term interest rates have moved up almost a percentage
point,'' he said. ``So we're clearly going to see construction and
interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy remain very weak and
may weaken more as we move through the year.''
   Chimerine's projection mirrors the 1.9 percent consensus
forecast in the latest survey of 51 top economists by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators in Sedona, Ariz.
   Economic strength in the first-quarter included building
construction, particularly housing, which was much stronger than
expected. But analysts point to unusually warm weather in January
and February which caused builders to ``borrow'' activity from
subsequent months.
   The trade deficit also narrowed but a stronger dollar may make
further improvement difficult since U.S. goods exported overseas
will be more expensive while imported products will be cheaper and
thus more attractive to American buyers.
   Other pluses were strong expansion of business investment and
moderate consumer spending increases.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms carrying heavy rain, high wind and at least six
tornadoes hopscotched across Texas and Oklahoma, forcing hundreds
of people to evacuate today, flooding towns and closing roads.
   At least three people were killed in Texas and two others were
missing.
   The Texas National Guard was called out today to help evacuate
businesses and hotels in Brownwood, southeast of Abilene, and
Weatherford, just west of Fort Worth.
   Police in Brownwood reported all major traffic routes under
water, some waist deep. Two of the three deaths were reported in
that town.
   ``I have never seen it rain this hard. It's raining so hard that
you can hardly see out,'' said Laura Goehl, a resident of
Stephenville, between Brownwood and Fort Worth.
   In Carter County, Okla., about 30 families were evacuated in the
town of Healdton late Wednesday after authorities broke into cable
television programming to ``warn them to head for higher ground,''
Healdton civil defense director Bill Dixon said. Emergency workers
had to rescue a few elderly residents from their homes, he said.
   At least 130 people were evacuated in the area of Proctor,
Texas, and nearby Proctor Lake, about 20 miles northeast of
Brownwood, as the lake rose and the rain continued today. Comanche
County officials warned people not to go outside except in
emergencies.
   Many of those evacuees had to be rescued by boat early today
after their cars and campers were flooded at a park near Proctor
Lake.
   ``We were pulling these people off the top of their campers and
trailer homes,'' said Sam Marshall, civil defense coordinator for
the area.
   ``A lot of the motor home under water are $100,000 jobs,'' he
said. ``And 28 to 30 have lost new Blazers or new automobiles.''
   Among those evacuees were elderly campers from northern states,
many of whom had to flee the lakeshore without vital medication,
said police Sgt. Ron Moe. ``A lot of them have heart problems or
are diabetics,'' Moe said.
   About 100 people were evacuated this morning from a flooded
subdivision in Parker County, just west of Fort Worth, said
Sheriff's Department dispatcher Ken Galbreaith. ``It's a madhouse
right now,'' Galbreaith said.
   Extensive damage was reported at Laughlin Air Force Base in the
Big Bend section of Texas. A base spokesman said wind up to 100 mph
damaged buildings and three T-37 trainer aircraft.
   More than a foot of water flooded the emergency room and first
floor of DeLeon Community Hospital in Comanche County, Texas.
   ``It's just a mess,'' a hospital spokeswoman who did not give
her name, said. ``It's still raining outside. It just keeps coming
in. We're trying to mop it up.''
   Some areas southwest of Fort Worth received as much as 10 to 15
inches of rain, the National Weather Service said. More than 13
inches of rain was reported at Comanche during the night.
   Most of north-central, central and southwestern Texas remained
under either flood, severe thunderstorm or tornado watches and
warnings early today.
   Eastern and central Oklahoma remained under a day-long flash
flood watch. Several highways were closed by high water in
southeastern and south-central Oklahoma, with water up to 8 feet
deep in places, said highway patrol dispatcher Robert Morales.
   High water in Carter County, Okla., prompted the closure today
of several schools.
   Numerous roads and highways in Texas were closed at dawn today.
Some bridges were washed out and others were damaged by flooding,
highway department officials said.
   In southeastern Oklahoma, emergency workers sandbagged a nursing
home in Calera against rising water to avoid having to move its
residents to higher ground, the Bryan County sheriff's office in
McAlester reported.
   A tornado touched down today in Corsicana, Texas, south of
Dallas. There were no immediate reports of injury.
   Two possible tornadoes were reported in the San Antonio area
early today. One damaged a mobile home, some cars and trees at
Concan. Hail as big as golf balls was reported in northwest San
Antonio.
   The series of storms began during the late afternoon Wednesday.
The weather service confirmed at least five tornados touched down
in Texas' Parker and Wise counties.
   ``It's on the ground. It's on us right now. It's real wide
rotation. I'm shutting the door. Here it comes,'' a National
Weather Service weather spotter near Weatherford, Texas, reported
by radio as a tornado neared her home.
   ``Metal is flying. Everything is flying around the air. It's
going to miss our house. It's over our neighbor's house. It's kind
of sitting on their house.''
   That twister damaged four homes in Parker County, about 40 miles

   A 77-year-old man died Wednesday in Brownwood when he was swept

<TEXT>
   A former federal judge who was
impeached by Congress and removed from office in November has been
arrested along with a state wildlife officer on hunting violations,
officials said Thursday.
   Former U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. was released on
$100 signature bond early Thursday after being booked at the
Jackson County Sheriff's Department, according to Capt. Mike
Diamond.
   Nixon, of Ocean Springs, was charged with hunting game birds by
using bait, a misdemeanor, Diamond said.
   Austin Shattles, a supervisor with the state Red Creek Game
Management Area in Jackson County, was charged with conspiracy to
bait turkey, the officer said. He also posted $100 bond.
   The arrests were the result of an undercover investigation by
the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.
   The Senate convicted Nixon, 61, on two counts of making a false
or misleading statement regarding a drug case to a grand jury in
1984. It removed Nixon from his federal judgeship Nov. 3 and
stripped him of his $89,500 salary. He was convicted in Hattiesburg
in 1986 of lying to a grand jury by denying he had discussed a
pending case with a former prosecutor. On March 23, 1986, Nixon
began serving two simultaneous five-year prison terms and was
paroled in November from a New Orleans halfway house.

   Government workers across France staged a one-day
strike for more pay Thursday, disrupting public transport, blocking
bridges and forcing some schools and museums to close.
   Air France and Air Inter canceled many of their flights because
air traffic controllers joined the strike. Only 25 percent of
regional trains operated.
   In the southeastern city of Bordeaux, striking workers blocked
three bridges leading into the city center, causing rush-hour
traffic to back up more than seven miles.
   In Paris, several thousand strikers joined a protest march to
the office of Premier Michel Rocard.
   The Orsay Museum in Paris, which houses a major collection of
19th century art, was closed because of the strike. So were many
schools across the country, although no figures were available
immediately.
   The strike was called by unions representing the nation's 5
million public workers, but neither the unions nor the government
gave estimates of many employees stopped work.
   Union leaders contend that the government did not keep promises
regarding the 1988-89 wage package and have been demanding an
across-the-board 1 percent supplementary payment.
   The government denies claims that public employees are losing
purchasing power. It says workers received increases averaging 7.2
percent last year, compared to an inflation rate of 3.6 percent.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said Thursday
the influx of Soviet Jews to Israel is more ominous for the Arabs
than the creation of the state of Israel.
   He made the statement in a speech to a crowd gathered for dawn
prayers marking the Moslem feast of Eid al-Fitr. The feast ends the
holy month of Ramadan, during which Moslems fast from dawn to dusk.
   Arafat urged Arab and Islamic nations to confront the issue of
increased Soviet Jewish emigration ``with effective measures and
not with mere resolutions.''
   ``The Jewish immigration is a more dangerous conspiracy than
those of 1947 and 1948,'' he said.
   The immigration has been spurred by growing anxiety over the
Soviet Union's future and the spread of anti-Semitism there, as
well as by U.S. visa restrictions. It is expected to total 100,000
this year.
   About 24,200 Soviet Jews have gone to Israel so far this year,
according to figures released by the Israeli government.
   The Arab world has complained that Israel plans to settle Soviet
Jews in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, lands seized from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel denies it steers
immigrants to the occupied lands.

   Sweden and Norway, which were in the
path of the radioactive cloud from the Chernobyl explosion four
years ago, said Thursday many of their lakes and rivers are still
dangerously contaminated.
   Finland, wedged between its Scandinavian neighbors and the
Soviet Union, escaped with less contamination because it had no
rainfall for several weeks after the accident April 26, 1986.
   Winds carried radiation from the nuclear reactor in the Soviet
Ukraine to the wilderness of central Sweden and Norway, 1,200 miles
to the northwest.
   Radioactive cesium soaked into the ground, contaminating lichen
and other plants eaten by wildlife.
   Finnish scientists said they were continuing studies to
determine if fallout had increased the incidence of cancer. First
results should be available next year.
   Swedish researchers said 14,000 lakes, or about 15 percent,
still contained fish too contaminated to eat. It may be 30 years
before the lakes will be considered safe.
   Fish have been found containing radiation levels 66 times higher
than the permitted level, according to researchers who examined 644
lakes.
   In Norway, newspapers reported that the level of cancer-causing
substances in the most effected regions was 10 times normal levels
in plants and up 20 times above normal in topsoil.
   Experts said parts of Norway will live with effects of fallout
well into the next century.

<HEAD>Open Letter Asks Congress to Assure Endowment's Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 30 prominent figures urged Congress
on Thursday to assure the survival of the National Endowment for
the Arts in the face of attacks from conservative lawmakers over
federal support for controversial art.
   In a full-page open letter to Congress published in The New York
Times and The Washington Post, the signers strongly supported the
grant-making endowment as the primary catalyst for extending the
arts to millions of Americans in the last 25 years.
   ``It is unfortunate that, recently, the NEA has become a subject
of political controversy,'' the letter said. ``Misrepresentation
and misunderstanding threaten its integrity, perhaps even its
survival.''
   The 31 signers urged Congress ``to safeguard what has evolved
from a national resource to a national treasure,'' as the House and
Senate consider legislation authorizing a five-year extension of
the endowment, an independent, $171 million federal agency.
   The letter, published in the name of the bipartisan ``Emergency
Committee for the Arts,'' was initiated by New York publisher
Arthur Levitt Jr.; Andrew Heiskell, former chairman of Time Inc.;
David Rockefeller, former chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, and
former Postmaster General Winton Blount.
   The other signers included Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of
The New York Times; S. Dillon Ripley, former secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution; Chicago business executive Marshall Field;
Derek Bok, president of Harvard University; former Treasury
Secretary C. Douglas Dillon; former Democratic National Chairman
Robert S. Strauss; Vernon E. Jordan, former president of the
National Urban League, and philanthropist Paul Mellon.
   The NEA's political troubles began last summer, when Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., protested the agency's previous financial support
for traveling exhibitions of controversial works by the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano.
   The Mapplethorpe show, the object of an anti-obscenity court
battle in Cincinnati, includes several homoerotic images and
pictures of nude children. Serrano was criticized for depicting a
crucifix submerged in urine.
   At Helms' urging, Congress voted last fall to prohibit the NEA
from financing works that ``may be considered obscene'' and lack
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. Rep.
Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and conservative religious groups are
demanding that Congress eliminate all funds for arts endowment.
   Attacks on the NEA have continued despite repeated declarations
by endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer that the agency will
refuse to finance obscene art. ``This agency is not a pornographer.
This agency is not a blasphemer,'' he said during a recent
interview with television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Levitt said the letter to Congrss published Thursday was
prompted by its sponsors' fears of an ``imminent threat'' to the
arts endowment's reauthorization because of the controversy.
   Levitt said the issues raised by Helms and his conservative
allies were ``dangerous issues, in that they are the kind of issues
it is very easy to mislead the public about.''
   He said the letter's signers, many of them influential in local
arts institutions around the country, believed it was time to
remind Congress of the endowment's achievements in sparking
private, community-based support for the arts through matching
federal grants.

   Paraguayan author Augusto Roa
Bastos on Thursday picked up the world's most prestigious
Spanish-language literary prize. He said he would use the $93,000
award to make books available cheaply in his homeland.
   King Juan Carlos presented the Cervantes Prize to Roa Bastos in
a ceremony in Alcala de Henares, Cervante's birthplace east of
Madrid.
   In presenting the prize, the Spanish monarch called Roa Bastos
``a man of letters and ideas, of words and conscience.''
   ``I see the prize as a double honor,'' Roa Bastos said, ``for my
work and for the culture of my country.''
   The 72-year-old author, who spent several decades in exile
during the dictatorship of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, is best known
for his 1974 historical novel ``I, The Chief'' about the life and
times of 19th-century Paraguayan dictator Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de
Francia.
   The prize is named for 16th-century Spanish writer Miguel de
Cervantes, the author of ``Don Quixote'' and considered by many to
be the father of the novel.
   The award jury, assembled by the Ministry of Culture, selected
Roa Bastos from among 32 candidates in November.

   Former U.S. Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop says promoting old-fashioned morality is the key to
preventing deadly diseases.
   ``At the base of each one of these painful, tragic, destructive
and, of course, preventable health problems is an equally tragic
and destructive human behavior,'' Koop told 500 people Wednesday at
a fund-raiser at Butterworth Hospital.
   The donations will go toward research, education and patient
care at the hospital, which marked its 100th anniversary Tuesday.
   Koop, who retired as surgeon general last year, said the biggest
lesson he learned was the link between people's behavior and
disease, including smoking, alcohol abuse, unwanted pregnancies,
child abuse, domestic violence and AIDS.
   ``Stern warnings about behavior can eventually lose their
effectiveness if they are used too often,'' Koop said. ``Instead,
we must affirm in the next generation a new sense of respect for
each human life.
   ``Perhaps a return to good, old-fashioned morality will do the
trick.''

   A handyman who set a shotgun booby trap that
killed an intruder at his warehouse will be charged with reckless
manslaughter and given a deferred sentence under a plea bargain
announced today.
   As part of a plea bargain, 46-year-old Philip Connaghan will
plead guilty to the manslaughter charge and to a misdemeanor charge
of violating the state's booby trap law, District Attorney Norm
Early told a news conference.
   In return, Early will recommend that Connaghan be given a
deferred sentence, meaning that he can have the conviction removed
from his record if he goes through a court-set time period without
breaking the law. Connaghan also will be required to perform
community service.
   The case aroused sympathy for Connaghan, who had $7,000 worth of
tools stolen from the same warehouse in July. He also reportedly
had been burglarized on other occasions.
   ``Philip Connaghan had no criminal record and had a positive
history of being a hard-working, law-abiding citizen,'' Early said.
``He recognizes that his conduct is illegal and ... he feels booby
trap devices are a danger to society and should be illegal.''
   Early said Connaghan was forthright about his actions and
admitted setting the booby trap in the warehouse that he leases in
downtown Denver's warehouse district.
   Michael McComb, 19, was killed by a blast from a 12-gauge
shotgun after he broke into the warehouse about 10:30 p.m. April 14
with three juveniles.
   The three youths, who have been released into the custody of
their parents, face possible burglary charges.
   Connaghan, who was in Kansas on vacation when McComb was killed,
surrendered to authorities on April 20 and was released on $5,000
bond Monday.
   Connaghan's friends helped rally support for the handyman,
taking up a collection to pay for a new set of tools and for his
legal defense. More than 100 other people have expressed support
for Connaghan through newspaper letters and calls to radio talk
shows.
   Early acknowledged that past burglaries played a role in
Connaghan's decision to set the trap. He said he decided the facts
did not support charges of first- or second-degree murder.
   The plea bargain is subject to approval by a judge, who must
either accept or reject it as written. The judge does not the
option of accepting the guilty plea alone and imposing a sentence
where none is recommended, Early said.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. House Vote on Jerusalem To Delay Hostage Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical Iranian newspaper said Thursday
that a congressional resolution endorsing a united Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel will delay the release of Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   Syria also denounced the resolution by the U.S. House of
Representatives, saying it emphasized an American desire to ``defy
Arabs and Moslems by stealing their rights without any lawful or
historical justification.''
   Iran's daily Islamic Republic said the congressional move ``made
things more complicated by blocking the way for solving problems.''
   Calling the resolution a deliberate snub to world Moslems, it
suggested Washington does not want to save the seven Americans and
10 other Western hostages in captivity in Lebanon.
   The hostage takers will ``delay their release in a natural
reaction,'' it said.
   Excerpts of the paper's commentary were carried by the Islamic
Republic News Agency, which is monitored in Nicosia.
   The non-binding resolution approved by the House on Tuesday goes
against longstanding U.S. policy of refusing to recognize Jerusalem
as Israel's capital.
   The eastern half of Jerusalem was occupied by Israel during the
1967 Arab-Israeli war. It contains the third-holiest site in Islam,
after the mosques in Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
   The resolution was passed two days after U.S. educator Robert
Polhill was released by pro-Iranian Lebanese captors after 1,182
days in captivity.
   Both Iran and Polhill's kidnappers, the Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, had called on the United States and the
West for a goodwill gesture to facilitate the release of the other
hostages.
   Along with Syria, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is
believed to have played a major role in gaining Polhill's release.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, a government statement said
Arab countries should work to overturn the House's ``unfair
decision'' before it becomes official U.S. policy.
   A similar resolution was passed last month by the U.S. Senate,
provoking an outcry in the Arab world.
   The Syrian state newspaper Al-Thawra said the Senate resolution
was a test balloon and that Arab inaction had allowed the House of
Representatives to act.
   ``It is not enough for the Arabs to cry, they must find a way to
support a powerful struggle,'' the editorial said.
   The Iranian newspaper, which is aligned with Rafsanjani's
radical rivals, said ``the timing of the resolution is not
coincidental, and it shows that the U.S. does not want the hostage
issue to be ended once and for all.''
   ``The U.S. representatives either lack political insight and
have launched on this foolish move or have signed the resolution
deliberately to stop the process of the release of hostages,'' the
paper said.
   Most of the Western hostages in Lebanon are believed held by
pro-Iranian Shiite factions.
   The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   In Sidon, Lebanon, meanwhile, four officials of the
International Committee of the Red Cross arrived to explore chances
for the release of two kidnapped Red Cross workers.
   Their arrival followed appeals by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
and Lebanese and Palestinian groups for the quick release of
orthopedic technicians Emanuel Christen, 33, and Elio Erriquez, 24.
   The pair were abducted from the Red Cross orthopedic center for
artificial limbs in Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon, on
Oct. 6.

   What will those rogue historians at Lipman,
Richmond, Greene claim next _ that Columbus arrived in America in
1493?
   In promoting Yonkers Raceway's 40th anniversary Friday, the
agency produced two radio spots featuring three wrong dates.
   ``The year is 1950 and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower is president,''
according to an ad broadcast Monday on New York radio stations.
``The Army-McCarthy hearings are going full blast.''
   Wrong. Wrong. Harry S. Truman was president in 1950. The
Army-McCarthy hearings began in 1954.
   The ad was redone, with Truman replacing Eisenhower and Bobby
Thomson's famous home run for the New York Giants substituting the
hearings.
   Wrong again.
   Thomson's ``shot heard 'round the world'' resounded in 1951.
   ``So, we were off by a year or two here and there,'' said a
beleaguered Richard Lipman, head of the agency.
   The first two mistakes were made by an agency employee, Lipman
said. The Thomson date was provided by the raceway. In the end, a
third version of the commercial dropped the reference to Thomson
and did not replace it.
   ``We finally gave up on trying to be factual,'' Lipman said.

   About 2,000 people tried to smooch their
way into the Guinness Book of World Records, aiming to set a record
for the greatest number of people kissing at the same time and
place.
   Participants at Wednesday night's kiss-off at Oregon State
University signed ticket stubs to be tabulated and submitted to the
record book.
   The current Guinness book does not contain a record for this
event, said Cassandra Wozniak, an organizer. She said efforts to
contact the Guinness record keepers earlier this week failed.
   At 7:03 p.m. Wednesday, organizers began a five-second
countdown. At the end, amid many giggles, hundreds of pairs of lips
smacked.
   Techniques varied. Some settled for modest pecks; others were
more dramatic. One couple was still kissing when the crowd broke up
and had to be separated by friends.
   Bryan Cook, 9, who did not participate, rolled his eyes when
asked what he thought. ``It's not gross, because I don't have to do
it. If I did, it would be.''
   At the other end of the age scale, Allen Scott, 74, and Janey
Wertz, 68, said the event was great. Scott, a retired professor,
had one small complaint. ``They started the event late. So we
started a little bit early,'' he said with a wink. The two plan to
marry in July.

   The woman who brings pizzas to the door may
look familiar to her customers. She's their former state senator.
   Shirley Marsh, who spent 16 years in the Legislature before
retiring in 1988, is now a delivery person for a pizza chain. The
wife of state Treasurer Frank Marsh said she took the job on a bet.
   ``I had been saying I'd like to have a part-time job, but a
friend said I could never find the time with all the volunteer work
I'm involved in,'' she said.
   Mrs. Marsh won the bet and is saving her earnings for a trip to
Europe. But she's done some fancy schedule juggling _ squeezing her
first two days of the job between trips to New York City for the
finance committee of the National Council of Churches, and to
Scottsbluff for Business and Professional Women, of which she was
district director.
   Next week, she's going to Kansas City for a meeting of the
United Methodist Women.
   ``That's why people didn't think I could get a job,'' Mrs. Marsh
said.
   She said she hoped her adventure into food service wouldn't
reflect badly on her husband's re-election campaign. She didn't
tell him about the job until she completed the training.
   ``On my first night out, I delivered a pizza to an 11-year-old
boy who said, `You must be having fun, delivering the best pizza in
the world.' And he had a dollar tip for me.''

   The Bush administration is resisting heavy
pressure to place Japan on a trade ``hit list,'' but members of
Congress are threatening to block approval of other trade
agreements unless there is a change of heart.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills gave strong indications
Wednesday that Japan will not be targeted a second time as a
country deemed to have erected the most onerous barriers against
sales of American products.
   The issue was to be reviewed today by President Bush's Cabinet,
with a final decision expected before the end of the week.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the matter is being
considered by the Domestic Policy Council and President Bush has
not made a decision. He said he did not know when the decision
would be made. The deadline is Monday, and a decision then is ``a
possibility,'' he said.
   The administration a year ago targeted Japan, Brazil and India
under a tough section of the 1988 trade law that provides for
economic retaliation against countries that fail to remove
objectionable trade barriers.
   The provision of the law, known as Super 301, was written with
Japan in mind. Several members of the Senate Finance Committee let
Hills know Wednesday that they believe Japan should be targeted
again.
   However, Hills objected that the Super 301 designation was not
appropriate in current circumstances and called on Congress to give
her more negotiating flexibility.
   She lavished praise on Japan and the government of Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, saying the Japanese had made significant
strides in the past month to reduce trade tensions between the two
countries.
   ``We have witnessed a remarkable transformation in Japanese
public attitudes about its protectionist trade policy,'' Hills
said, praising Kaifu's government as ``responsive and decisive.''
   She announced to the committee a last-minute agreement in which
Japan met American demands to remove barriers blocking sales of
U.S. forest products. She said the pact, which lowers tariffs and
revises Japanese building code standards, should boost sales of
U.S. wood products by more than $1 billion in the next year.
   The forest products issue was one of three raised in last year's
Super 301 case against Japan. The other issues _ expanding sales of
U.S. supercomputers and satellites _ were resolved in recent weeks
as Japanese officials rushed to make concessions in hopes of
heading off designation again as a country with unfair trade
barriers.
   Despite the concessions, many U.S. industry groups and members
of Congress are calling on the administration to target Japan again
to keep pressure on a country that accounts for nearly half of
America's overall trade deficit.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
the administration would be making a serious mistake if it failed
to cite Japan. He contended that the country has a poor record in
honoring its market-opening commitments.
   Bentsen and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., held out the threat that
Congress would block legislation needed to implement pending trade
agreements with Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union and
China and new rules being negotiated as part of a global round of
trade liberalization talks.
   ``If the administration ignores a trade law that Congress has
constitutionally enacted, I am concerned it may poison the well for
the consideration of those agreements,'' Bentsen told Hills.
   Some in the administration have argued that no country should be
cited this year for fear that it would be wrong to antagonize other
nations when the United States is seeking their help to conclude
trade liberalization talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, which regulates world trade.
   But Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said failure to cite Japan and other
countries would send a ``dangerous and inaccurate'' message that
the administration is not serious about protecting the interests of
U.S. businesses.
   Danforth complained that the administration was confusing
``achieving agreements with obtaining results.''
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., told Hills that he would push for
legislation to extend the requirement for the administration to
target countries, which was to expire this year.
   However, Sens. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., both said Japan should be rewarded for its
newfound willingness to negotiate.

   Ask not for whom the bell tolls, but who

   Rita Reichel last saw the 200-pound brass school bell in her
basement around Christmas. Now it's gone and she has no idea who
could have carted it up the steep stone steps.
   ``I know it would take at least two strong men,'' said Reichel,
who recently discovered the bell missing and reported it to police.
   Reichel, 40, said her father gave her the bell on her 16th
birthday so she could someday build an old-fashioned wishing well
like her grandmother had.
   ``It's so valuable, just to me,'' she said. The bell was
estimated to be worth about $1,500.
   Reichel remembers that even getting the bell down to the
basement was an experience. ``We used ropes. I just can't figure
out how it would get out of that house.''

<TEXT>
   Awaiting the start of the grand jury
investigation she had fought for, Joyce Cutshall strolled in the
woods where her kidnapped daughter's clothing was found.
   It is in the Wood Duck wildlife refuge, Ms. Cutshall said, that
she feels close to her missing child.
   ``She gave the best hugs,'' Ms. Cutshall recalled, her voice
cracking.
   Ms. Cutshall, who spent weekends in shopping malls collecting
more than a thousand signatures to force the grand jury probe, saw
her long campaign bear results today when the grand jury was chosen.
   Madison County District Judge Richard Garden selected 16 grand
jury members and three alternates from a pool of 40 people and
instructed them to report Friday for a meeting with a prosecutor.
Testimony is expected to begin Monday.
   Jill Cutshall was 9 when she was abducted on Aug. 13, 1987, from
the steps of a baby sitter's home in this city of 20,000 about 110
miles northwest of Omaha. Her father, Roger, had dropped her off in
the morning, and she was waiting alone for the baby sitter to
arrive when she disappeared.
   Four months later, a hunter found some of Jill's clothing at the
wildlife refuge, but an extensive search yielded no other trace of
the girl.
   No one has been arrested.
   Authorities said the kidnapping may have been a random sexual
assault.
   Thousands of fliers with Jill's picture have been distributed
throughout North America, and the case was the subject of a ``60
Minutes'' report.
   The CBS show identified two former Norfolk residents who were
questioned by local police but were not charged, including one who
said in an interview with an Omaha TV station he was involved in
the abduction.
   But the man told Norfolk police he made the statements because
he was threatened. Roy Stephens, a private investigator who worked
on the Cutshall case, has acknowledged firing a gun into the air
before the man made his videotaped statements.
   Frustrated by what she considered lax police work, Ms. Cutshall
launched a petition drive to force a grand jury investigation.
   Under state law, a court is required to convene a grand jury if
presented with petitions from at least 10 percent of the county's
voters who took part in the last governor's election. Ms. Cutshall
needed 1,024 signatures and collected 1,471.
   ``It won't be over for me until I can bring Jill home,'' Ms.
Cutshall said Tuesday. ``The answer I want is where is Jill and
when can we get her back here. Once we get her back, we will have
all of the other answers.''
   She said she believes police overlooked or did not follow up on
information and failed to put pieces of the puzzle together. Ms.
Cutshall said she is confident the grand jury will ``have no other
choice than to hand down indictments.''
   But Police Chief Bill Mizner said he is proud of the work done
on the case. ``I think the police division has done an excellent
job, and it's not only the police division but all other law
enforcement agencies involved,'' he said.
   A special prosecutor assigned to the case, James D. Smith, said
that a grand jury probe will only duplicate investigators' efforts
and that it holds the danger of a premature indictment.
   Ms. Cutshall, who was living in Kansas and divorced from Jill's
father at the time of the kidnapping, moved back to Norfolk to
pursue her quest for answers into the girl's disappearance.
   She finds herself coming back to the refuge. There, she said,
she feels close to her daughter, who enjoyed music and writing
poetry.
   Sitting among the trees and dense underbrush, she lightly patted
the ground where her daughter's clothes were found in a neat,
leaf-covered pile _ shoes first, then jeans and her purple shirt on
top.
   ``Intellectually, I know she's not going to come home,'' the
mother said. ``There's probably 2 percent of me (that believes she
is alive), and that's because you always have to have some kind of
hope.''

   Iran said Thursday that a number of
people convicted of spying for the United States will be executed
in the next few days.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency did not say how
many alleged spies would be executed, and it did not identify any
of them.
   IRNA, in a dispatch monitored in Cyprus, quoted Ibrahim Raisi,
the Tehran Revolutionary Court's prosecutor, as saying: ``In a bid
to deal a blow on the Islamic revolution, the U.S. intellignce
service used to regularly receive information from these people on
the country's social and economic situation.''
   It said the people ``will be hanged within the next few days.''
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said in April 1989 that a
network of spies who provided the CIA with details and documents
about Iranian military planning had been broken.
   The New York Times reported in August that U.S. officials
confirmed the Iranian report.
   Four alleged U.S. spies were hanged in November in Iran.
   Revolutionary courts in Iran are usually run by radicals. The
report of expected executions appeared designed to fan
anti-American sentiment _ an issue that might complicate President
Hashemi Rafsanjani's efforts to end Iran's decade-long isolation.
   Thursday's announcement followed the release in Beirut of
American educator Robert Polhill, who was held 39 months by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem zealots.
   Tehran was reported to have played a major role in securing his
release. Rafsanjani is believed to favor an end to the hostage
issue to normalize ties with the West and attract investment and
technology for his country's flagging economy.
   Rafsanjani's opponents want the hostages to remain as the major
hurdle blocking good ties with the West, especially the United
States.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's transition from a communist
to private enterprise economy will be swift and thorough in order
to avoid the ``halfway'' reforms that are causing economic chaos in
the Soviet Union, the Czech finance minister said Thursday.
   ``Partial reform of a distorted economy ... is much worse than a
non-reform,'' and delays to prepare a comprehensive blueprint mean
``postponing it to eternity,'' Minister Vaclav Klaus said.
   Such a cautious approach ``leads very soon to chaotic
disintegration of the economy, as we see in the Soviet economy just
now,'' Klaus added in a speech to the World Bank's second annual
conferening the problem to see what was
wrong.
   ``Either we are getting the wrong information to make our
calculations or we are making a mistake somewhere procedurally,''
he said. ``We are just going to have to slowly and systematically
work through that before we decide what is wrong.''
   Originally, officials had said the second outage also lasted
about 45 minutes. But four hours later, the center still had not
communicated with the high gain antennas, which are the primary
communications links to relay science data to the ground during
normal operations, Elliott said. There was contact with the
telescope's low gain antennas which can be used in emergencies.
   The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was
released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
   Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud
rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.
   ``Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that
song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. ``There are a
lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and
Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.''
   ``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied
Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
   After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of
maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park''
Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
   ``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday.
   ``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work
you've done,'' replied Mission Control. ``Galileo is real proud of
you.''
   Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive
unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since
Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
   Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope
while controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
Md., make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to
directional commands.
   The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot
aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from
the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Data will follow in a month or two.
   If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk
to fix it.
   Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door
is opened.
   ``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive
instruments.
   On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist
it from the cargo bay.
   One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as
expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
   But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge
when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its
39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out
on the third attempt.
   By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away
from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance
call.
   Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
   The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was
dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting
atmosphere.
   Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the
beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their
light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to
determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
   The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but
was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
   Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to
land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

<HEAD>House Committee, Defying Bush, Votes to Halve Salvador Military
Aid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee defied
President Bush on Thursday, voting to cut U.S. military aid to El
Salvador in half and to impose strict new conditions on the money.
   On a voice vote, the Democratic-dominated panel moved to cut the
$85 million a year that the United States provides to help El
Salvador's military. The action amended a bill that would authorize
spending of emergency aid Bush wants this year for Nicaragua and
Panama.
   Congressmen expressing the Bush administration's opposition to
the move called it partisan and unwise, giving legitimacy to
leftist rebels.
   But supporters of the changes said the new conditions would
encourage both the government and rebels to negotiate a peace
agreement. It would be up to the president to decide whether the
conditions have been met.
   If the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
continue to receive weapons shipments from outside the country,
thwart peace talks or mount a military offensive, the government's
military aid would be restored. If the government fails to
negotiate in good faith or adequately investigate last year's
murders of six Jesuits, it would lose the other half of its
military aid.
   Any military aid that is cut would not be lost entirely by the
government, but would be funneled instead into humanitarian
programs for the country.
   ``There are real consequences for either side in the event they
misbehave,'' said Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who sponsored the
amendment.
   It remained unclear whether the restrictions on aid would ever
be finally enacted into law. House Democratic leaders planned to
meet next week with Secretary of State James A. Baker III in an
effort to begin drafting a new bipartisan U.S. policy toward El
Salvador which could head off the restrictions.
   The administration, which voiced strong disapproval of
Thursday's move by the House committee, saw it largely as an
attempt to improve Democrats' negotiating position as they enter
discussions with Baker.
   The FMLN has waged a decade-long civil war in the countryside of
El Salvador, and right-wing military elements have responded with
death-squad killings. The war has claimed an estimated 70,000 lives.
   ``We've already waited too long,'' Studds said. ``We've been far
too patient, far too timid, and we've watched far too many people
die.''
   The two sides recently agreed to negotiate under the auspices of
the United Nations. That, coupled with a change in governments in
neighboring Nicaragua, which is expected to shut down the weapons
flow to the rebels, has created the most hopeful climate for peace
in years.
   Republicans on the House panel argued that any tampering with El
Salvador's aid would damage that climate. ``This is an effort to
score partisan political points,'' said Rep. William Broomfield,
R-Mich.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the move would grant credibility
to the FMLN which it does not deserve. ``This assumes there is only
one set of thugs in El Salvador,'' he said. ``Why do we want to
legitimize the other thugs, the FMLN?''

<TEXT>
   U.S. negotiators announced today that they
have reached basic agreement on a new trade accord with the Soviet
Union that would normalize trade relations between the two
countries for the first time in nearly a half century.
   U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Julius Katz, the leader of the
U.S. negotiating team, said ``fundamentally, we have reached
agreement on the text'' of the new pact.
   He said that the exact language still needed to be worked out on
four minor issues but he did not believe they would pose an
obstacle to signing a final document when President Bush meets
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in Washington from May 30 to
June 3.
   ``As far as I am concerned, we have substantial agreement and I
do not see an obstacle to its signature at the time of the
summit,'' Katz said in a telephone conference call.
   He spoke to reporters in Washington after the end of Thursday's
negotiating session in Paris. The discussions were allowed to
continue this week after Bush decided against imposing economic
sanctions on the Soviet Union because of its crackdown in Lithuania.
   Bush on Tuesday announced that he was not imposing any
sanctions, ending days of debate inside the administration over
whether the economic talks with the Soviets should be cancelled in
an effort to bring pressure to bear on Gorbachev to seek a
negotiated settlement of the Lithuanian situation.
   Even after all the minor issues have been cleared up, the new
economic agreement cannot be signed by Bush until he certifies that
the Soviet Union is allowing free emigration of Soviet Jews and
other dissidents from the country.
   Bush has said he will sign such a waiver once the Soviet Union's
more liberalized emigration policy is written into law by the
Soviet Parliament.
   At the summit with Gorbachev in Malta, Bush expressed the hope
that normalizing trade relations would give a boost to the Soviet
economy.
   The trade agreement is needed to grant the Soviet Union the
trade status of ``Most Favored Nation,'' qualifying it for the
lowest tariffs granted to any other country.
   Currently, Soviet exports into the United States bear duties as
much as 10 times higher than imports from other nations.
   U.S. officials have predicted that trade between the two
countries could double or even triple over the next three years
with a new trade agreement.

   The Moon of Baroda, a 24-carat diamond that
Marilyn Monroe wore to promote the film ``Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes,'' eclipsed its presale price by fetching $297,000 at
Christie's auction house.
   ``Bidding was strong, and the room was crowded,'' Christie's
spokeswoman Doris Athineos said Wednesday.
   The buyer bid by telephone, said Athineos, who did not identify
the person. The price far surpassed presale estimates of $120,000
for the pear-shaped yellow diamond.
   The Moon of Baroda's history dates from the late 15th century.
It became the property of the Gaekwars of Baroda, a powerful family
in India.
   It kicked around in royal circles for the next five centuries,
finally getting confiscated from the Gaekwars by the Indian
government after World War II. Meyer Rosenbaum, president of
Detroit's Meyer Jewelry Co., acquired the stone in the 1950s.
   He suggested Monroe use the diamond to promote the film, which
starred Monroe singing, ``Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.''

   Mexican President Carlos Salinas expressed
``strong displeasure'' to Vice President Dan Quayle today over the
U.S. handling of a drug arrest and called for new ground rules for
U.S.-Mexican cooperation in the war on drugs.
   Quayle and Salinas met for nearly three hours at the president's
residence in what the U.S. vice president conceded was a
contentious session.
   Mexico has accused the United States of a role in the abduction
of a Mexican doctor, Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, who now is
awaiting trial in Los Angeles in the 1985 torture and murder of a
U.S. drug enforcement agent.
   ``President Salinas expressed to me his strong displeasure with
the Dr. Alvarez incident,'' Quayle told a news conference after his
meeting.
   The session was Quayle's final stop on a fence-mending mission
assigned to him last January by President Bush to soothe Latin
American hard feelings over the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Mexico claims U.S. DEA agents violated its sovereignty in
seizing Alvarez.
   Quayle again reiterated U.S. insistence that it had not sent DEA
agents into Mexico to seize Alvarez Machain.
   However, Quayle appeared to indicate that his reassurances to
Salinas fell short of calming the situation.
   Quayle said that Salinas told him that Mexico wants new rules
and agreements to govern future U.S.-Mexican cooperation on drug
investigations and arrests.
   However, while claiming that Bush was ``always open to new
ideas,'' Quayle gave no indication that the administration was
ready to progress toward a new drug agreement.
   A Bush administration official who attended part of the
Quayle-Salinas session told reporters that among the ``new rules''
that Salinas wants are provisions for better advance notice by the
United States of its drug operations that involve Mexico.
   The official, who spoke under conditions of anonymity, also said
that Salinas wants a better system for sharing information with the
United States.
   The official said Quayle told the Mexican president, ``He
thought we already were sharing information.''
   Quayle said U.S. agents did not go into Mexico in the Alvarez
Machain matter and said the administration was not ready to
consider recalling the DEA agents that are now working on Mexican
soil.
   Quayle said these agents are ``a constructive force for
conducting a cooperative effort in the war on drugs.''
   Quayle insisted that the flap did not undermine long friendly
U.S.-Mexican ties.
   ``Mexico is a friend. Mexico is a neighbor,'' Quayle said.
   And the vice president said, ``There should be no doubt
whatsoever that we respect the sovereignty of Mexico.''
   Today's trip to the United States' closest ally in Latin America
wraps up a fence-mending assignment that Bush gave Quayle after the
December 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama that toppled the government
of Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``The purpose of my visit is to once again emphasize on behalf
of President Bush the importance that we place on this
relationship,'' Quayle said in arrival remarks at the Mexico city
airport.
   Quayle on Thursday attended the inauguration of Nicaragua
President Violeta Chamorro, bringing her the first installment of a
$24 million U.S. food aid package and promising additional U.S.
support in the future.
   This was Quayle's third Latin American swing in the aftermath of
the Panama action and ``this trip completes the mission,'' said the
vice president's press secretary, David Beckwith.
   The Justice Department said last week there were no plans to
return Alvarez Machain to Mexico, saying he would be held to face
charges in Los Angeles for alleged participation in the murder of
Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   The Mexican government claims U.S. agents violated Mexican
sovereignty in the arrest of Alvarez Machain _ suggesting he was
kidnapped to the United States.
   He was arrested at the El Paso, Texas, airport on April 3.
   The DEA has denied published reports that it paid bounty hunters
to capture the Mexican doctor and bring him to the United States.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said last week that DEA agents
were not involved in Alvarez Machain's capture in Mexico.
   The arrest sparked a diplomatic protest from the Mexican
government. And the Mexican attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del
Castillo, has said it could end U.S.-Mexican cooperation on drugs.
   Quayle represented Bush on Wednesday at Mrs. Chamorro's
inauguration in Managua, Nicaragua. Her election in February ended
the 11-year rein of Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega.
   Quayle praised Mrs. Chamorro as ``a symbol of unity'' in
Nicaragua. But he also said she faces ``Herculean economic
problems'' in taking over from Ortega.
   He voiced U.S. support for her decision _ unpopular even among
many of her own backers _ to retain Gen. Humberto Ortega, Daniel
Ortega's brother, as chief-of-staff of the armed forces.
   Quayle called it a ``very delicate decision'' she had to make,
but suggested retention of Humberto Ortega could help heal
divisions in the country.
   And, in naming herself defense minister, Mrs. Chamorro made it
clear the military ``will be civilian-controlled and
civilian-ruled,'' Quayle said.

<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich will host
a satellite broadcast ``American Opportunities Workshop'' that he
says is a non-partisan outreach program designed to attract
disaffected voters.
   Yet the May 19 broadcast from five locations around the country,
estimated to cost at least $250,000, is being bankrolled by GOPAC,
a fund-raising committee that helps Republican candidates.
   ``There are references to ideas, but there are no references in
the entire show to either political party,'' Gingrich said in an
interview before Wednesday's announcement of the program.
   Gingrich said he is trying to convince Americans of all
political stripes that ``the bureaucratic welfare state and
permissive attitudes'' are responsible for many of today's problems.
   They must be replaced with ``a new model'' for government, he
said, in which Americans solve problems by helping themselves
rather than relying on the government.
   Gingrich said some Democrats, such as former Carter
administration Attorney General Griffin Bell and Polly Williams, a
member of the Wisconsin legislature who once was on welfare, will
join in the effort.
   The program will originate from Gingrich's home district in
Georgia and will contain appearances by participants in four other
cites. Some 500 workshops have been set up around the country, he
said, where people will watch the program by satellite hookup and
debate the issues.
   Gingrich long has worked to increase the ranks of Republicans in
the House, where they are outnumbered by Democrats 258 to 176. But
he insisted the telecast, which may set the stage for a series of
such workshops, is not a party-building effort per se.
   Gingrich said that if a Democrat such as Sen. Bill Bradley of
New Jersey or Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia ``someday ends up as
president on a platform made up of these kind of ideas ... that's
fine.''
   ``Our goal is not the shape of the parties. It's the shape of
the country,'' he said.
   Gingrich acknowledged that while he will avoid preaching GOP
gospel as such, the self-help appeal is designed to attract
disaffected Democrats and others from the nearly 50 percent of the
voting population that did not participate in the last presidential
election.
   ``It is true that a lot of Democrats, for ideological reasons
don't feel comfortable being involved,'' Gingrich said. ``Because
in their party it wouldn't be positive to be involved in something
like this. But it seems to me that's a commentary on the Democratic
Party, not a commentary on what we're trying to do.''
   Asked whether it was an effort to build the Republican Party,
the ``nonpartisan'' label notwithstanding, he replied, ``Oh, sure.''
   ``It is fair to say that it is part of a continuing effort ...
to expand the Republican base,'' he said. ``But it is also fair to
say that, in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, that you become
less partisan and more interested in serving.''

   Soldiers fired into a crowd of 4,000
Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing three
and wounding more than 120 in the worst clash in nearly a year,
hospital officials and Arab witnesses said.
   In the West Bank, soldiers killed a Palestinian youth when a
procession of Moslem worshipers pelted an army compound with stones
as they marched to a cemetery to honor the dead, the military said.
   The Gaza confrontation began as thousands of chanting believers
left two mosques after morning prayer services for the Eid al-Fitr,
which celebrates the end of the holy month of Ramadan.
   It was one of the worst incidents of the 2-year-old Arab
rebellion and the bloodiest since three Palestinians were killed
and about 50 wounded during the same holiday last May 6. The
upsurge of violence came in marked contrast to the subdued level of
conflict in recent months.
   The army confirmed that two Palestinians were killed and 117
wounded in the Jabaliya refugee camp, a shantytown of 53,000 where
the revolt against Israeli occupation began more than 28 months ago.
   It said 12 soldiers were slightly injured by stones in the clash
and that it was checking a hospital report of the third death.
   Ahmad, a street vendor who was wounded in the arm, told a
reporter from his hospital bed that soldiers panicked when crowds
chanting ``Allahu Akbar!'' (God is Great) approached a fenced-off
army encampment on their way to a traditional cemetery visit.
   About 20 soldiers inside the camp then fired tear gas, he and
other witnesses said.
   ``We were heading to visit our dead people and then they started
shooting tear gas at us,'' he said, refusing to give his last name
because he feared arrest. ``I think the army thought we wanted to
attack them after they saw such huge crowds.''
   Witnesses said scores of Arabs responded with a barrage of
stones until a dozen border police jeeps, several armored personnel
carriers and a helicopter came to the soldiers' assistance.
   They said troops and border police clashed with the worshipers
as the helicopter dropped dozens of tear gas canisters.
   Gaza commander Brig. Gen. Shmuel Zucker told army radio soldiers
had been given special orders to restrain from opening fire.
   He said soldiers avoided shooting ``until the stones began to
endanger their lives. ... The event is completely out of the
ordinary. Jabaliya has been quiet for a long time.''
   The army put the camp under curfew and declared the Gaza Strip a
closed military zone, barring journalists from entering.
   Jorgen Rosendal, the administrator of Ahli Arab hospital, said
nearly 140 Palestinians were treated for wounds in the city's two
major hospitals.
   ``It's the highest number of casualties we have had since last
May,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Arab reports identified those Killed as three camp residents:
Awadallah Ibrahim Awadallah, 25, a laborer shot in the chest;
Khaled Musa Al Aswad, 35, a mosque prayer caller who was hit in the
stomach; and Muhammed Ali Muhammed Abu Sammam, 30.
   In Qabatiya in the West Bank, troops fatally shot 20-year-old
Naher Shelaby and wounded five other Palestinians during a similar
religious procession, the army command said.
   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus and surrounding camps, home
to 120,000 Palestinians. In Bethlehem, reinforcements were posted
near cemeteries to prevent violence.
   Cemetery visits also came in response to a call issued by the
pro-PLO underground leadership of the uprising for honoring the
graves and families of ``martyrs'' killed in the revolt.
   Thursday's deaths brought to 680 the number of Arabs killed by
Israeli gunfire in the rebellion. In addition, 209 Palestinians
have been slain by other Arabs as suspected pro-Israeli
collaborators. Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence.

   Former Gov. Richard Snelling launched his
1990 campaign Thursday to regain the office, saying the state
``faces a dramatic blend of great opportunities and sobering
risks.''
   The 63-year-old Republican, whose previous term in office was
1977-1985, called for a renewed effort to balance Vermont's
environmental desires and its needs in view of a faltering economy.
   ``We have held on to much of the spectacular beauty which was
bequeathed to us by our forefathers,'' he said. ``But we all know
that we have been losing some of these wonderful elements of our
inheritance and that without determination, hard work, sound
planning and prudent investment, we will not be able to give to
children that which was given to us.
   ``But we cannot neglect an equal responsibility to assure a
standard of living that enables Vermonters to stay in Vermont.''
   The political landscape in the gubernatorial race was turned
upside down this month with the decision by Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a
Democrat, not to seek re-election.
   Former state Sen. Peter Welch jumped onto the Democratic ticket.
A group of Republicans already had been pushing for a Snelling
candidacy.

<TEXT>
   A smiling Robert Polhill
returned to American soil today after 39 months as a hostage in
Lebanon.
   Polhill flashed a thumbs up sign and waved as he walked off the
U.S. military plane that flew him to Andrews Air Force Base outside
Washington.
   He quickly shook hands with a small welcoming delegation, then
walked with his wife, Feryal, to a nearby car for a drive to Walter
Reed Army Hospital.
   The 55-year-old business professor declined to talk to
reporters, pointing to his throat as if to say he was not yet ready
to speak.
   Polhill's release left seven Americans among 17 Western hostages
still held in Lebanon. The longest-held is American Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   AFN, the U.S. military's radio network, reported that a special
U.S. debriefing team that met with Polhill in West Germand earlier
in the week had left Europe. The report gave rise to speculation
that another hostage release was not immediately expected.
   Polhill was released by his captors in the Middle East on Sunday
and underwent medical tests and intense debriefings at a U.S. Air
Force Hospital in Wiesbaden. He was to undergo additional tests at
Walter Reed.
   His release left seven Americans among 17 Western hostages still
held in Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   One U.S. source said the debriefing team was impressed with the
vivid details that Polhill provided about the conditions and
surroundings in which he was held for 39 months in Lebanon.
   On Wednesday, Hussein Musawi, the reputed spiritual mentor of
Polhill's captors, Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,
urged the kidnappers not to release another hostage because of a
U.S. House of Representatives resolution declaring Jerusalem
Israel's capital.
   Syria today also sharply condemned the House resolution, saying
it was intended to emphasize the American desire to ``defy Arabs
and Moslems by stealing their rights without any lawful or
historical justification.''
   In Iran, a radical newspaper said today that the resolution
would delay the release of other Western hostages in Lebanon. The
Farsi-language Jomhuri Islami, or Islamic Republic, said it ``made
things more complicated by blocking the way for solving problems.''
   On Wednesday, he visited with a kindergarten class of children
of U.S. servicemen who had sent him a welcome-back card they
designed featuring a teddy bear. In his first public appearance
since arriving on Monday, he posed for pictures on a hospital
balcony with the 14 children.
   Accompanied by his wife and his two sons, Polhill waved to
reporters and kissed and hugged his wife.
   The balcony was lined with American flags and draped with a
banner saying: ``Welcome Home! Pray For The Others.''
   About 75 servicemen, nurses, doctors and fellow patients cheered
Polhill, who clasped his hands over his head and held his fingers
high to form a victory sign.
   Polhill, who quickly has become known for his good sense of
humor _ something doctors say helped him endure captivity _
bantered with his sons Stephen, 26, and Brian, 23.
   ``I'm funnier than he is,'' Brian shouted.
   Laughing, Polhill pointed to himself and gave a thumbs-up sign
and a thumbs-down sign to his sons, then spoke to them.
   ``He says you're making him feel really wonderful _ thanks,''
Brian shouted to the crowd of onlookers and reporters.
   Kindergarten teacher Kim Miller said that during the five-minute
visit, Polhill gave each of the children a yellow flower, and they
gave him pictures they had drawn.
   ``He gave everybody a little hug and he thanked us for coming,''
Mrs. Miller, of Upland, Calif., told reporters.
   Polhill, a diabetic, lost 25 pounds during his captivity and was
very tired when he was released Sunday.
   Mrs. Miller said he still appeared weak on Wednesday and spoke
very softly.
   ``I told him that it was nice to have him back,'' said
6-year-old Ricky Houser III from Youngstown, Ohio.
   Wiesbaden City Manager Reinhold Edel visited Polhill earlier and
formally welcomed him to the city with a case of local wine.
Polhill said he hoped the case contained a reorder blank, military
officials said.
   Polhill was abducted on Jan. 24, 1987, from the Beirut
University College campus along with two other U.S. academics,
Alann Steen and Jesse Turner.
   U.S. officials said Tuesday that Polhill shared a room with
Turner and Steen and was probably in the same building as some of
the other Western hostages held by the Moslem Shiite fundamentalist
group Hezbollah, or Party of God.

<TEXT>
   A former guerrilla leader who joined the
presidential race last month was killed today by an assailant who
opened fire with a machine gun aboard an airliner reportedly
carrying more than 100 people.
   The assailant was immediately killed by the candidate's
bodyguards, police said. The plane returned to Bogota, where the
leftist politician died one hour after being admitted to a
hospital, officials at the hospital said.
   Radio reports said about 120 people were aboard the Avianca
Boeing 727 but that no passengers or crew members were injured in
the shootout, which occurred shortly after the plane left Bogota on
a domestic flight.
   An anonymous caller to the Caracol radio network said drug
traffickers killed the politician, Carlos Pizarro, and that he was
targeted in a lottery with the names of other candidates. The
caller claimed to be a spokesman for the Extraditables, the name
given to drug traffickers wanted for trial in the United States,
and he threatened another such attack.
   Pizarro, 38, was the third presidential contender killed since
August 1989 in Colombia, which is engaged in brutal battles with
drug cartels, leftist guerrillas and right-wing death squads.
   Caracol radio said in a report from the hospital where the
candidate was taken that he was hit by 15 bullets, including three
in the head.
   The unidentified assailant opened fire 10 minutes into the
flight, which was heading to the Caribbean city of Barranquilla, a
spokesman for the national police told The Associated Press.
   The assailant emerged from a bathroom aboard the plane, drew a
machine gun from a black leather jacket, and opened fire on
Pizarro, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Pizarro and his bodyguards were seated near the rear of the
plane. The bodyguards opened fire, killing the assailant, the
spokesman said. Officials in Pizarro's political party said at
least six bodyguards were aboard the flight.
   Two men with machine guns were arrested at the Barranquilla
airport, a police spokesman in the city said in a telephone
interview. The two apparently were waiting to kill Pizarro in case
the assassin aboard the plane did not get a chance to do so, the
policeman said on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, violent demonstrations to protest Pizarro's slaying
occurred in the port city, and three buses were set afire, the
policeman said. It was not known if the protests resulted in
injuries.
   Pizarro was commander of the leftist M-19 guerrilla movement,
which disbanded on March 8 and surrendered its weapons. The group
became a political party, with Pizarro as its candidate for the May
27 presidential election.
   M-19 takes its name from the date of a presidential election on
April 19, 1970, that the group claimed was fraudulent.
   As a guerrilla leader, Pizarro commanded 900 fighters, who
opposed capitalism and what they viewed as U.S. imperialism. In its
most daring operation, the guerrilla group captured the Palace of
Justice in a 1985 assault that left 115 people dead, including 11
Supreme Court justices.
   On March 22, another leftist presidential candidate, Bernardo
Jaramillo, was killed in a hail of machine gun fire from an
assassin at Bogota's airport.
   Jaramillo represented the leftist Patriotic Union Party. The
government blamed drug traffickers for the killing, but party
members blamed right-wing death squads. More than 1,000 members of
the Patriotic Union have been assassinated in the last six years.
   On August 18, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, an anti-drug crusader and
a governing Liberal Party presidential candidate, was assassinated
by drug traffickers at a rally outside Bogota.
   Within hours, the government declared war on the traffickers and
announced plans to extradite drug lords to the United States for
prosecution. The Medellin and Cali drug cartels once imported more
than 80 percent of all the cocaine smuggled into the United States,
U.S. officials have said.

   The Legislature has overwhelmingly
approved a campaign-reform package that its supporters hope will be
a model for similar legislation in Congress.
   The Elections and Ethics Reform Act of 1990, which sets
voluntary spending limits and provides public financing for
congressional races, cleared the House on Wednesday by 128-0. The
Senate sent the bill to Gov. Rudy Perpich for his signature on a
vote of 61-1.
   Perpich said he's inclined to sign the bill.
   The bill also prohibits state lawmakers from soliciting campaign
contributions from lobbyists during legislative sessions, expands
lobbyist disclosure requirements, requires the Legislature to
conduct its business in public and establishes a new screening
process for judicial appointments.
   Supporters say Minnesota is the first state to enact such
legislation.
   ``People everywhere are frustrated with the excessive influence
that money plays in politics today, especially when it comes to the
United States Congress,'' said state House Speaker Robert Vanasek.
   ``We will be sending the strongest possible message to Congress
that the time has come for Congress to mend its ways and enact
campaign finance reform on its own,'' said Vanasek, of the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, which controls the House and Senate.
   ``The way to get the federal government moving again is to end
the money monopoly that has weakened our elections and made the
voters cynical and turned off when election time comes,'' he said.
   Many Independent-Republicans said they saw the reform package as
a step in the right direction and voted for it despite reservations
that it may be found unconstitutional. Ben Ginsburg, chief legal
counsel for the National Republican Committee, has said if the
campaign finance provisions become law they will be challenged.
   The bill sets voluntary spending limits of $425,000 for U.S.
House candidates and $3.4 million for U.S. Senate hopefuls,
effective Jan. 1.
   If both major party candidates for an office agreed to abide by
the limits, neither would receive taxpayer subsidies. If one
candidate agreed and the other did not, the candidate who limits
expenditures would receive public financing of up to 25 percent of
the limit established for the office they seek.
   Under a 1974 state law, candidates for the Legislature and state
constitutional offices, including governor, receive a partial
public subsidy if they agree to accept spending limits.
   The bill also reinstates a state income tax credit for
contributions to political parties and to state and federal
candidates who agree to abide by spending limits. Under the bill,
individuals can claim a credit equal to contributions of $50 or
less and couples can claim a credit equal to contributions of $100
or less.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker will hold
talks in Warsaw on May 6 with Polish leaders about the pace of
German unification.
   His visit, announced Thursday by the State Department, will
follow a meeting of the World War II Big Four _ the United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ on military aspects of the
impending merger of East Germany with West Germany.
   Poland was overrun by German forces in World War II. Millions of
Poles were killed in battles and concentration camps.
   As a result, Poles have been seeking reassurances that the
Germany that will emerge from unification will not threaten its
neighbors.
   West German officials, meanwhile, have informed Warsaw that
Germany would not try to recover territory that was taken from it
and made part of Poland at the end of the war.
   Baker will go to Warsaw from, Bonn where he will meet with the
foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain and France on German
questions.

<HEAD>Mitterrand, Kohl Call on Lithuania To Suspend Independence Drive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand and West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged Lithuania on Thursday to meet Moscow's
demands for a suspension of its independence drive.
   In a letter, Mitterrand and Kohl said Lithuanian President
Vytautus Landsbergis should rescind pro-independence laws to clear
the way for talks with the Kremlin, ``so that the current crisis
ends in a solution acceptable to all parties.''
   ``Without doubt, it would facilitate the start of such talks to
suspend temporarily the effects of decisions taken by your
Parliament,'' the letter said. Lithuanian lawmakers declared the
republic independent March 11.
   The letter said temporarily rescinding pro-indpendence laws
``would take nothing away from their validity since they were taken
under a universally accepted principle _ the principle of the
self-determination of peoples.''
   The letter was drafted during a two-day summit in which Kohl and
Mitterrand discussed a wide range of issues. It came two days after
President Bush refused to impose economic sanctions against the
Soviet Union for its military and economic campaign against
Lithuania.
   Kohl and Mitterrand said a copy of their letter was sent to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The two Western leaders said
at a news conference that they wanted to avoid ``complicating''
Gorbachev's problems.
   The Soviet Union said Monday it might negotiate with Lithuania
if the Baltic republic froze its March 11 declaration of
independence for two years and agreed to adhere to the Soviet
constitution for achieving independence.
   Lithuanian leaders repeatedly have refused to do that, saying
their country was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and
was never legally incorporated into the Soviet Union. They also
contend Soviet laws would make actual secession extremely difficult.
   Landsbergis has denied reports Lithuania would consider
suspending its declaration. However, an aide has said a Lithuanian
delegation, waiting in Moscow for a chance to negotiate with Soviet
leaders, would consider such a proposal if it were formally made.
   In an article published Thursday in the conservative French
newspaper Le Figaro, Landsbergis wrote that Moscow was becoming
``its own worst enemy'' by persisting with a hard line against
Lithuania's bid for independence.
   ``If the Soviet Union continues to use force to crush Lithuanian
independence ... we will all lose. It will prove that perestroika
is a collection of political failures and not an authentic
transition toward democracy,'' Landsbergis wrote.
   Landsbergis said his people ``were under no illusion about our
economic dependence on Moscow.''
   ``But we don't understand why, today, this master-slave
relationship must be prolonged, and why _ to our great surprise _
it is considered by certain of our Western friends to be the
solution to the problem.''

   Ground controllers at the Goddard
Space Flight Center finally made contact today with the two main
antennas on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope after trying
for more than six hours to lock on.
   Applause erupted in the Hubble control center in Greenbelt, Md.,
as the glitch that marred Hubble's first full day in space was
solved.
   ``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna
system,'' said NASA's Dave Drachlis.
   Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were
working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing
either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications
satellite that acts as a switchboard.
   In the successful attempt, they nearly doubled the width of the
antennas' beams to take in more territory, from a sweep of 6.2
degrees to 10.8 degrees.
   The telescope's low-gain antennas, which receive and transmit
information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies,
were working well.
   Space shuttle Discovery was 46 miles away, available to remedy
certain problems. The outage was not a problem for which space
walkers would have been summoned.
   The five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of
storms over Texas from their 380-mile-high perch, and doing
experiments.
   Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of
the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and
was not a serious problem. It began between 1 and 1:30 a.m. EDT and
lasted 45 minutes to an hour, he said.
   The second failure occurred at 6:44 a.m. when controllers
attempted to send a signal to the telescope's two high-gain
antennas through the TDRS.
   ``This time it was a pointing problem,'' said Jim Elliott, a
Goddard spokesman. ``It's a new spacecraft and we think
inexperience dealing with it was the cause.''
   The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was
released from the shuttle's cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute
snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
   Mission Control awakened the crew early today with a loud
rendition of the song ``Shout,'' a fraternity house favorite.
   ``Good morning, Discovery. I guess you're awake after that
song,'' said Kathy Thornton, shuttle communicator. ``There are a
lot of happy people down here. We saw a great deploy yesterday and
Hubble had a good night while you were asleep.''
   ``We appreciate the good words from everybody,'' replied
Discovery Commander Loren Shriver.
   After Wednesday's deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery
away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of
maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to ``park''
Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
   ``The telescope really looked great as we flew away from it, and
we sure hope it does good work,'' Shriver said Wednesday.
   ``Well, it sure is now, Loren, and thanks for all the great work
you've done,'' replied Mission Control. ``Galileo is real proud of
you.''
   Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASA's most expensive
unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since
Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
   Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope
while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is
operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
   The next milestone is Friday, when the telescope's 10-foot
aperture door is to be opened, exposing the finely polished
94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
   Then on Tuesday, NASA expects to release the first image from
the telescope: an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Data will follow in a month or two.
   If the aperture door doesn't open properly, Discovery could
return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk
to fix it.
   Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be
tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door
is opened.
   ``We want to be in full control so we don't ever endanger the
Hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight,'' he
said. Too much light could damage the telescope's sensitive
instruments.
   On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttle's
50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist
it from the cargo bay.
   One of the telescope's solar arrays unreeled from its mast as
expected and started providing power to the telescope's batteries,
which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
   But there was trouble with the second panel. It wouldn't budge
when the latches were released, and then moved about a fifth of its
39-foot length and stopped again. The panel rolled all the way out
on the third attempt.
   By the final attempt, astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock, 30 minutes away
from taking tools in hand and going on an outer-space maintenance
call.
   Wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown.
   The 8{-hour procedure was performed 380 miles above Earth, 70
miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was
dictated by the need to put Hubble above the Earth's distorting
atmosphere.
   Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the
beginning of the time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their
light has taken 14 billions years to reach Earth. They hope to
determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
   The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983 but
was delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
   Discovery, which blasted into orbit Tuesday, is scheduled to
land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

   A Lithuanian man was hospitalized after he set
himself on fire Thursday in central Moscow, Soviet authorities said.
   The man, identified by the official Tass news agency as
Stanislavas Jamaitis, was in the intensive care unit at
Sklifasovski Hospital with second- and third-degree burns.
Interfax, a branch of state-run Moscow Radio, said his last name
was Janaitis.
   He made no political statements, displayed no signs, and gave no
written account of his motives, Tass said.
   However, relations between Lithuania and the Kremlin have been
tense since Moscow imposed an economic embargo on Lithuania in
response to the republic's declaration of independence.
   The man poured flammable liquid on his trouser leg and ignited
it outside the Bolshoi Theater a few blocks from Red Square, said
the duty officer at Moscow police headquarters.
   The officer, who refused to give his name, said passers-by
rushed to the man shortly after he set himself afire and
extinguished the flames.
   Jamaitis was born in 1938, is married with two children, and had
not maintained constant employment in recent months, Tass said.
Vilnius radio said he lived in western Lithuania.

<HEAD>Britain Lifts Exclusion Order on Irish-American Activist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has revoked an order barring
Irish-American activist Martin Galvin from entering the country,
the Home Office said Thursday.
   Galvin is publicity director for the New York-based Irish
Northern Aid Committee. It has been accused of supporting the
outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to end British
rule over the province of Northern Ireland.
   He was deported in August as an illegal alien after being
arrested in Northern Ireland for defying a 1984 order banning him
from Britain. Galvin appealed the expulsion.
   Home Secretary David Waddington notified Galvin on Monday that
he had overruled an appeals officer and was lifting the exclusion
order, said a Home Office spokeswoman.
   ``During the appeal hearing, Mr. Galvin's solicitors produced a
certificate of his registration as an Irish citizen,'' said the
spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The adjudicator accepted that Mr. Galvin was a dual citizen of
the United States and of Ireland. This means that he is a (European
Community) national, subject to community law, and therefore
benefiting from rights of free movement under the Treaty of Rome,''
the spokeswoman said.
   Galvin, a lawyer and resident of New York City, has been banned
from entering British territory since July 1984 when he gave a
speech endorsing violence one day after a soldier was killed in
Londonderry, Northern Ireland.

   Freed hostage Robert Polhill
returned to American soil Thursday, offering a broad smile and a
thumbs-up salute but no word on his 39 months in captivity.
   Polhill, 55, stepped off a military jet minutes after landing at
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.
   He smiled broadly and offered intermittent waves and thumbs-up
signs but would not respond to questions shouted by reporters. He
pointed to his throat at one point when pressed to speak and
mouthed the words, ``I can't.''
   His reception was low-key, with a State Department protocol
official and Army and Air Force officers on hand to welcome the New
Yorker and his Lebanese wife, Feryal.
   Polhill walked from the plane to a government car and was
whisked away under sunny skies to Walter Reed Army Medical Center
for a physical and other medical tests.
   He gave a final salute as the car passed by reporters and about
30 other people, most of them uniformed Air Force personnel,
gathered on the edge of the tarmac.
   Polhill was flown here from Wiesbaden, West Germany, where he
spent three days in an Air Force hospital after his weekend release.
   Army doctors on hand for the arrival said the length of
Polhill's stay at Walter Reed depends on his condition. Polhill, a
diabetic, lost 25 pounds during his captivity. He was reported to
have had a voracious appetite in Wiesbaden.
   ``Rather than speculate what his problems will be, we would like
to take some time to evaluate and allow him to rest,'' said one of
the doctors, Russ Zajtchuk.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that
President Bush planned to have Polhill in for a visit soon but that
a date had not been set.
   Also leaving Wiesbaden on Thursday was the U.S. team that
debriefed Polhill, a development that further dampened hopes
another American hostage might soon be freed.
   Immediately after Polhill's release, there was some hope that at
least one of the seven Americans still held in Lebanon would be
released. In the last few days, however, a number of developments
have suggested otherwise, among them demands from Shiite militants
that Arab prisoners held by Israel and Kuwait be freed before they
release another hostage.
   House passage earlier this week of a resolution recognizing
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel also angered Arab leaders.
   ``We have no indication that there is going to be a release'' in
the near future, Fitzwater told reporters.
   Polhill, a business professor, was abducted with two other
American educators on Jan. 24, 1987. The others, Jesse Turner of
Idaho and Alann Steen of Boston, remain captives. All taught at the
American University in Beirut.
   During his stay in Wiesbaden, Polhill reportedly gave the
debriefing team a detailed account of his captivity and kidnappers.
U.S. officials said Polhill likely was kept in the same Beirut
building as other Western hostages.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held American hostage.

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Proposes Major Cuts in Aircraft Programs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Desk: CORRECTS 20th graf, On the, changing figure from $12.6
billion to $11.9 billion, a correction issued by the Pentagon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed today
to sharply reduce the Pentagon plan to purchase 132 B-2 Stealth
bombers to 75 planes as he unveiled a package of aircraft cutbacks
designed to save $34.8 billion through 1997.
   Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney
said the changes were warranted because NATO faces ``fewer enemy
aircraft and a reduced ground threat'' as a result of the dramatic
changes sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   But Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., told reporters after
the morning session that Cheney's reductions may not placate the
budget cutting ardor on Capitol Hill.
   He faulted Cheney's program, contending it was ``still based on
an unrealistically pessimistic view of the Soviet threat.''
   Cheney's blueprint follows a detailed Pentagon study of military
needs, and came one day after an Army official said troop levels
would probably be cut by 250,000 over the next five or six years.
   He was scheduled to testify later in the afternoon before the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The proposed reductions in aircraft would also affect the size
of the Navy. In answer to a question from Aspin, Cheney said
reducing the number of A-12 attack planes could mean elimination of
two of the Navy's 14 aircraft carrier battle groups.
   The defense secretary testified that his plans would trim $2.41
billion from earlier estimates of Pentagon spending plans for 1991,
and $34.8 billion through 1997. Cheney offered his plan at the same
time the Democratic-controlled House and Senate are drafting
spending blueprints for 1991 expected to call for sharp cuts in
Pentagon spending.
   The proposal drew mixed reactions from members of the Armed
Services committee.
   ``Let me tell you where I think this proposal is in trouble,''
said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, and an opponent of the B-2 bomber.
``We're cutting a little bit and we're stretching a lot ... and
when you cut and stretch you drive up the cost.''
   But Rep. Robert Davis, R-Mich., said Cheney's cut in the number
of B-2 purchases gives the Republicans ``a very dependable
position, something we can sell to the House and the American
people.''
   In his statement, Cheney said the reduced purchases and delays
``will save $16.8 billion in 1991 through 1994, the department's
current five-year spending plan, and another $18 billion during
1995 through 1997.''
   He said the Stealth cutback would lower the projected cost of
the plane from $75.4 billion to $61.1 billion, a saving of $14.3
billion over the life of the program.
   Cheney also said he intends to cut planned purchases of the C-17
long-range transport plane and the Navy's A-12 attack aircraft, and
delay purchases of the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Aircraft and
the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   Congressional pressure has intensified to reduce the Pentagon's
budget following the lessened Soviet threat and the budget crunch.
Supporters of the $530 million radar-evading bomber have warned
that the per-plane cost could double if fewer aircraft are ordered.
   Cheney's statement said some of the widespread changes were
necessary because NATO forces will face ``fewer enemy aircraft and
a reduced ground threat'' once announced Soviet withdrawals from
Warsaw Pact nations are completed.
   But the secretary insisted that despite such developments, the
nation's current bomber force must be updated with the B-2 by the
turn of the century. The primary contractor for the bat-winged
plane is Northrop Corp.
   ``Soviet air defenses, both missiles and fighter aircraft, will
pose an increasing challenge to our current standoff and
penetrating bombers,'' Cheney said in the statement.
   Cheney said he intends to cut the number of B-2 aircraft to be
purchased in the next fiscal year to two planes, from the five
currently proposed at a cost in the fiscal 1991 budget of $5.5
billion. And the maximum number of planes to be built during peak
years of production would be reduced to 12 instead of 24, Cheney
suggested.
   On the other aircraft programs, the secretary proposed to buy
120 of the C-17 long-range transport planes instead of the 210
originally planned at a proposed savings of $11.9 billion over the
life of the program. The plane is designed to replace the aging
C-141 transport plane.
   Cheney noted the new transport plane's ability to land on the
``shorter runways typical of the Third World.'' The statement was a
plug for its use by the armed forces of the future, designed to
fight in conflicts such as the Panama invasion as the threat of a
major land war in Europe recedes.
   The secretary also proposed that the Pentagon buy a smaller
number of Navy's A-12 all-weather medium attack planes, cutting the
original request of 858 to a minimum of 620.
   The A-12 is designed to replace the Navy's A-6E Intruder, which
is now reaching the end of its service life as a aircraft-carrier
based long-range strike jet.
   Cheney said the Air Force's version of the plane, the Advanced
Tactical Aircraft, which is supposed to be used for deep attack
missions now handled by the F-111 and F-15, ``can safely be delayed
given the current nature of the threat and capabilities of aircraft
in inventory.''
   Production of the ATA would be delayed beyond 1997, the end of
the Pentagon's long-term five-year budget cycle, Cheney said.
   Cheney also suggested that purchases of the Advance Tactical
Fighter be delayed from 1994 to 1996. The aircraft is intended to
replace the Air Force's F-15. The number to be purchased should
remain at 750, Cheney said.
   The delay in that fighter will also delay the procurement of the
Navy's version by two years, and reduce the number of aircraft to
546 from the original 618 planned, the Pentagon statement said.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the
eviction of Jewish settlers who stirred an international protest by
moving into a building in the Christian quarter of Jerusalem's old
city.
   Officials of the Greek Orthodox Church, which owns the building,
were dissatisfied because the ruling allows maintenance workers and
20 guards hired by the settlers to remain until a lower court
resolves the tenancy dispute.
   The church argues the settlers are in the building under an
illegal sublease. It said it would close all Christian shrines in
the Holy Land on Friday to protest the presence of the 150 armed
settlers.
   The Jewish settlers moved into the 72-room St. John's Hospice on
April 11. The action brought protests from Christian clerics,
Palestinian Christians and Moslems, the U.S. State Department,
pro-Israeli lobby groups and the government of Greece.
   The Neot David settlement in Jerusalem was seen as part of a new
settlement drive by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the hawkish
leader of the right-wing Likud Bloc who was chosen Thursday to form
a new government.
   The State Department called the Neot David settlement ``an
insensitive and provocative act.'' The U.S. government opposes all
settlements on land Israel captured in the 1967 war, saying it is
an obstacle to peacemaking with the Arabs.
   The walled Old City is divided into Moslem, Christian, Jewish
and Armenian quarters. Each sector contains holy sites and shrines,
and the slighest changes in the status quo have historically led to
violence.
   In its ruling, the three-judge panel said the settlers who are
affiliated with the Ateret Cohanim seminary must leave by Tuesday.
Settler representatives said they would comply.
   Church attorney Avraham Sochovolsky claimed victory. ``Twenty
people is not a settlement. The main point was (to have their)
children and women. Now they have watchmen and maintenance.''
   But church spokesman Bishop Timothy Margaritis said the court
did not go far enough.
   ``We were expecting that the building would be evacuated
completely and that somebody else would undertake to guard the
place,'' he said. ``Now, it's like recognizing the rights of the
Panamanian company.''
   The Panama-based SBC says it subleased St. John's from Martyros
Matossian, an Armenian Christian, for $3.5 million, and that the
settlers were its guests. The government admitted this week that it
contributed $1.8 million to the settlement.
   A spokesman for the settlers said in a statement: ``We are
pleased that the court has recognized SBC as having legal
possession of the property and hope the courts will decide to let
the company continue to operate the guest house.''
   The church says Matossian had no right to sublet. It has filed
separate eviction orders against Matossian and SBC, and the Supreme
Court urged the lower court to act quickly in the tenancy dispute.
   Dan Avi-Yitzhak, an attorney for SBC, said the case was a test
of Jewish sovereignty over Jerusalem. ``If we give up the right to
settle in the capital of Israel, where do we have the right to
settle?'' Avi-Yitzhak asked the court during the seven-hour hearing.
   Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem, including the old city,
from Jordan during the 1967 Middle East war. It annexed the sector
but Israel's claim to sovereignty over the entire city is not
recognized by most countries.
   Church officials said they opposed Jewish presence in St. John's
because it was so close to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, which
marks the sites where many Christians believe Jesus was crucified
and buried.
   ``We don't want people with machine guns walking near our church
and frightening the pilgrims,'' said Archbishop Cornelius of
Sebastian, who attended the court session.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, who argued the settlement provoked
strife among religious groups, welcomed the court ruling and said
he hoped it would help restore calm in the city.
   ``To my great sorrow, the damage that has been caused will
nonetheless take years to repair,'' he said.

<HEAD>Texas Explosion Prompts New OSHA Rules</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Labor Department on Thursday promised
quick new safety rules for the petrochemical industry in an effort
to prevent disasters such as last year's Phillips explosion that
killed 23 workers in Texas.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration plans to
establish the new safety guidelines by the end of the summer, the
agency said in a report to President Bush outlining causes of the
Oct. 23 blast at the plant in Pasadena, a Houston suburb. Another
130 workers were injured.
   The probe showed the explosion could have been prevented through
better safety procedures and that it demonstrated the need for
mandatory safety rules at plants that use and store highly
flammable liquids and chemicals, the report said.
   ``The investigation of the Phillips catastrophe has caused OSHA
to take stock and consider a strong course of action to prevent
such disasters,'' the report said.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. has said its own investigation showed
company safety procedures were not followed. It plans to appeal at
least part of the $5.7 million in fines OSHA proposed last week for
alleged ``willful'' safety violations.
   ``Phillips is eager to review any recommendations OSHA can offer
that will further improve the safety of our operations,'' the
Bartlesville, Okla.,-based company said in a statement Thursday.
   Most of OSHA's new requirements will be fundamental safety
procedures that many firms already are following, said Gerard
Scannell, assistant labor secretary in charge of OSHA.
   The mandatory safety guidelines, which would affect about 2,300
petrochemical plants nationwide, would include requiring companies
to analyze hazards in the workplace, ensure equipment works
properly, train and inform employees on hazards, and develop
emergency response procedures, Scannell said.
   The agency is required to review public comment on the proposed
rules, so it could be up to a year before they take effect.
   C.T. Roberts, a Phillips employee at the Texas plant who was off
duty when the blast occurred, said the new OSHA guidelines are long
overdue.
   ``The only way these companies are going to take safety
seriously is to be pushed into it,'' said Roberts, who was in
Washington for an AFL-CIO event to spotlight attention on workplace
injuries and deaths.
   OSHA also will consider revising the way it sets priorities for
inspections and devoting more attention to the petrochemical
industry, Scannell said.
   Right now, OSHA allocates resources according to a priority
system based primarily on industry injury rates. The report to Bush
said OSHA may start considering other factors as well, such as the
potential risk to workers.
   Historically, the petrochemical industry has had a lower injury
rate than other industries, the report said. But it noted that
major disasters have occurred recently in the industry, including
the 1984 disaster in Bhopal, India, where a deadly chemical release
killed more than 2,000 people, and in Mexico City, where an
explosion of liquified petroleum killed about 650.
   Sectors of the petrochemical industry with a high potential for
fire, explosion or catastrophic release include those involving
plastics, synthetic rubber and petroleum refining, the report said.
   OSHA's investigation into the Texas blast showed that four
highly flammable gases escaped from an open valve, forming a huge
vapor cloud that traveled through the plant within seconds under
high pressure.
   A series of explosions occurred after the cloud came in contact
with an unidentified ignition source.
   Contrary to Phillips' own procedures, as well as standard
industry practice, there was no backup protection such as a double
valve to protect against valve failure or protect against an
untimely valve opening, Scannell said.

   She's That Cosmo Girl! It's her 25th birthday
and she still wants it all _ a man who loves her, good sex, a great
bod', and a job that makes her happy.
   What does she read? Cosmopolitan, of course _ Helen Gurley
Brown's magazine for women who are ``ambitious, achieving, man
loving.''
   ``The magazine was for and still is for a woman who loves men,
loves children, is very female, loves sex. But she doesn't want to
live through other people,'' said the 68-year-old editor in chief.
   The May issue, Mrs. Brown's 300th, was published Tuesday. It
features a brunette Madonna, red lips just parted, in a white dress
with the plunging neckline that has become a trademark of the
sultry Cosmo covergirls.
   ``I think people like to look at bosoms. I do,'' Mrs. Brown said
in an interview Wednesday in her office. ``I think if you have a
terrific bosom, you're wondering how you compare. If you don't have
a wonderful bosom, you still enjoy looking.''
   The magazine's topics have stayed as constant through the years
as the cover cleavage: Sex, male-female relationships, Mrs. Brown's
``deadly sins'' (anger, greed, hate, fear and jealousy), and
careers and health.
   ``The format is so sound and solid that there is really no
reason to change it,'' she said.
   In 1965, when Mrs. Brown revamped the format of what was then an
ailing, 79-year-old magazine, its circulation was 783,000. Today,
it is bought monthly by 2.7 million Americans, according to the
Audit Bureau of Circulation. There are 24 foreign editions in 10
languages.
   In line with the Cosmo format, the silver anniversary issue
includes articles on how to improve your self-esteem (invest in
your looks, be well-informed, choose supportive men) and how to
boost your sexual confidence (learn to satisfy yourself, don't hide
erotic skills, forgive your flaws).
   There's also a centerfold of TV celebrity David Hasselhoff with
two well-placed Shar-Pei puppies.
   Mrs. Brown was a 38-year-old disgruntled copywriter at a Los
Angeles advertising agency when she wrote the titillating 1962 best
seller, ``Sex and the Single Girl,'' a how-to book on having an
affair.
   She and her husband, David Brown, the film producer, then
parlayed the book into a magazine proposal that they pitched to
Hearst Magazines.
   Hearst was unwilling to risk starting a new magazine but was
interested in a makeover of the fading, literary Cosmopolitan,
which had published John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway and W.
Somerset Maugham.
   In March 1965, Mrs. Brown recalled, she walked into the office
of Cosmopolitan as editor in chief, after ``weeping up a storm''
the night before because she knew nothing about publishing and
editing.
   Thus a new Cosmo was born, along with That Cosmopolitan Girl,
the personification of the magazine's readership in advertisements.
   The magazine preached that single girls could have their own
jobs and apartments, fall in love and enjoy sex _ shocking concepts
in days before America's sexual revolution.
   Although the rising feminist movement would soon reject the
magazine as one that fostered reliance on men, contemporary
feminists now recognize that Cosmopolitan played an important part
in reshaping women's views of themselves.
   ``I think ... that Helen Gurley Brown, in her editorship, has
been a rather spirited and gutsy example in the revolution of
women,'' said Betty Friedan.
   Mrs. Brown says she has always been a devout feminist.
   ``I totally sympathize with what they did and had to do. But at
the same time the Cosmo format was and still is along the lines of
my philosophy, which is that life is better with somebody to love.''
   The magazine that was so long a leader is now being criticized
by some as outdated.
   ``Cosmo still has a peculiar 1972 singles orientation to it,''
said Danielle Crittenden, a writer and analyst of women's magazines.
   Where the magazine once popularized sexual freedom for women,
she said, it now reflects ``a kind of desperation and loneliness
that is very depressing _ that things didn't work out for whatever
reasons.''
   Circulation has dropped slightly from an all-time high of 3
million in 1985, according to the Audit Bureau. Its readership is
slightly older than it was 10 years ago _ 30.7 years old, up from
30.1. Half the readers are married.
   Mrs. Brown still believes in a Cosmo girl who can have it all.
   ``I get absolutely incensed that women are told that we can't
have it all, that it's not working out, it's too much work, that
we've got to go home and behave ourselves, because it's never said
to men.''

   Game show host Bert Convy was in fair
condition and underwent tests Thursday to determine why he
collapsed during a hospital visit with his mother.
   ``They are still running some tests to try to figure out why he
passed out,'' said Ron Wise, spokesman at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center. ``His condition is listed as fair and he's stable.''
   On Sunday, the ``Win, Lose or Draw'' host was visiting his
mother, Monica, who has been hospitalized for a stroke, and he
passed out, Wise said.
   ``He took a very hard fall,'' Wise added.
   The nature of the tests wasn't disclosed.
   Convy, 50, also was host of the game show ``Tattletales'' and
appeared in the movies ``The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,'' ``The
Man in the Santa Claus Suit,'' ``Help Wanted: Male,'' ``Love Thy

   A scientist who was to have flown on
the next space shuttle mission has contracted an unspecified
illness and NASA said Thursday he may be dropped from the flight.
   The scientist, Samuel T. Durrance, didn't arrive at the Kennedy
Space Center on Thursday with the six other astronauts who will fly
aboard the Columbia, which is scheduled for launch May 16.
   NASA said only that Durrance ``has developed a medical condition
which is being evaluated to determine if it will affect his
assignment as a payload specialist on the upcoming STS-35 flight.''
   He would be only the second American astronaut to be dropped
from a flight. In 1970, Thomas K. Mattingly was exposed to measles
shortly before the Apollo 13 mission to the moon. Mattingly was
replaced and flew later in the Apollo and space shuttle programs.
   Durance, 46, holds a doctorate in physics and is a research
scientist at John Hopkins University in Baltimore. He is assistant
project scientist for the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, one of the
instruments scheduled to fly as part of the Astro Observatory
aboard the Columbia.
   Durrance would be replaced by Kenneth H. Nordsieck, another
scientist, who has trained as a backup.

<HEAD>Women's Groups Protest Bishop PR Plan Against Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve Roman Catholic women's groups on Thursday
termed as ``scandalous'' a plan by U.S. bishops to launch a
multimillion-dollar public relations campaign against abortion.
   ``We were shocked by your decision,'' the groups said in an open
letter urging the bishops to halt the project.
   ``More fetal life could be saved by $5 million spent on caring
for pregnant women and their children than by developing slick
slogans or by bullying politicians.''
   The letter was addressed to Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of
Cincinnati, president of the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, and Cardinal John O'Connor of New York, chairman of the
bishops' anti-abortion committee.
   A spokesman for O'Connor declined to comment on the letter until
it had been reviewed.
   O'Connor announced recently that a New York public relations
firm, Hill &amp; Knowlton, and the Wirthlin Group, a polling
enterprise, had been retained for a broad-based national campaign
against abortion.
   He said about $1 million a year was expected to be spent during
the next three to five years in the campaign directed at Catholics
and non-Catholics.
   The women's groups, in a letter released by Catholics for a Free
Choice in Washington, D.C., said the ``resoundingly negative public
reaction'' to the plan should have persuaded the bishops to abandon
it.
   ``If not, we must add our voices to the growing chorus of the
faithful who insist that these efforts, which are seriously
damaging to the credibility of all Catholics who work in the public
arena on justice issues, cease. ...
   Detailing other church financial needs, the letter said:
   ``Our church is in economic trouble. Many dioceses are running
deficits. Elderly nuns are on welfare. Inner-city parishes are
closing daily because the buildings cannot be maintained.
   ``Parents can barely manage to pay the rising tuition rates
necessary to keep their children in parochial schools. Teachers are
so poorly paid they need two and three jobs to care adequately for
their own families.
   ``Social problems related to the church's mission abound:
feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless,
caring for the sick and elderly. Are these needs not more urgent
than the politics of abortion? ...
   ``Spending $5 million on the politics of abortion when the
church is unable to provide for the spiritual and social needs of
Catholics is scandalous,'' the women's groups said.
   Among the organizations were several major groups, such as the
National Coalition of American Nuns, the National Assembly of
Religious Women and Chicago Catholic Women, all based in Chicago.
   Other groups included the Women's Ordination Conference, based
in Fairfax, Va.; Quixote Center Women-Church of Mount Rainier, Md.;
Institute of Women Today of Chicago, and Women's Alliance for
Theology, Ethics and Ritual of Silver Spring, Md.

<HEAD>Former Marine Sentenced to Psychiatric Treatment for Espionage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Marine communications officer
was sentenced Thursday to 10 years' imprisonment in a psychiatric
facility for selling classified information to the Soviet Union.
   U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III issued the sentence
after a court-ordered psychiatric exam found that Frank Nesbitt,
45, suffered from severe personality disorders, depression and
apparent episodes of psychosis _ a disability that can impair one's
touch with reality.
   Doctors, however, also had raised the possibility that Nesbitt
was pretending to be ill.
   Nesbitt's attorney, David Hopkins, said the sentence was
appropriate, as did Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hulkower.
   Nesbitt served from 1963 to 1966 in the Air Force's Electronic
Security Command in West Germany and from 1969 to 1979 in the
Marine Corps, where he dealt with classified communication
gathering.
   He also worked at the Los Alamos Naional Laboratories from 1983
to 1984. During all his jobs he maintained a top secret clearance.
   He pleaded guilty to espionage charges earlier this year after
admitting he had agreed to cooperate with the Soviets. But he
claimed he did not know the information was classified.
   ``It was my true and honest effort not to do that,'' Nesbitt
told the court on Feb. 1.
   An FBI Special Agent testified Nesbitt abandoned his wife and
two children at their Millington, Tenn., home last June, and left
behind a note that said ``Don't look for me. I'm gone.''
   Nesbitt will serve his time at a federal facility in Buttner,
N.C.

   On a sun-baked slope, hundreds of
Contras rebels listened to an aide of President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro telling them to lay down their weapons.
   But the attitude among Contras outside this mountain hamlet
recalled U.S. Gen. George McAuliffe's famous World War II response
to a German general's invitation to surrender.
   ``Nuts,'' the rebels replied Wednesday _ in loosely translated
Spanish invective _ to their earlier agreement to disarm when Mrs.
Chamorro was inaugurated.
   Others met the appeal by the Chamorro aide, Roberto Ferrey, with
silence and stares.
   The rebels laughed when Israel Galeano, one of 12 rebel chiefs
standing at the bottom of the hill, asked ``anybody who wants to
give up his rifle, come forward.'' He said would be the last
handing over his gun.
   When one shouted, ``Nobody gives up his gun!'' all cheered and
applauded.
   The rebels are angered and alienated by Mrs. Chamorro's
concessions to the leftist Sandinistas, which allow them to keep
command of the army.
   ``We're prepared to hand over our weapons only when not a trace
of those elements is left,'' one rebel told Ferrey, calling the
Sandinista officer corps ``insects.''
   Members of the anti-Sandinista army, created by the United
States in 1981 and sustained by Washington until early this year,
were to begin handing over their weapons to U.N. peacekeepers
Wednesday after Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   A pact signed last week by leaders of the Contras, the
Sandinistas and the new government committed the rebels to
demobilize by June 10.
   El Destino is about 85 miles north of Managua. It is one of five
zones where about 9,000 Contras are to gather and voluntarily
surrender their weapons to U.N. soldiers.
   About 3,000 came here during the past week and this week and
2,000 more are expected in coming days. They roamed the
180-square-mile zone at will, still armed with Soviet-designed
AK-47 assault rifles, grenade launchers and weapons.
   A few dozen U.N. peacekeeping soldiers _ mostly Venezuelan, with
Spanish and Irish officers _ were on duty, but, under their
mandate, they could do nothing other than receive weapons that were
voluntarily handed over.
   The Contras were low on food and were supposed to receive
rations and demobilization aid from the Organization of American
States after surrender. But few, if any, apparently had received
the aid.
   Immediately after she became president, Mrs. Chamorro canceled
compulsory military service, become her own defense minister and
temporarily retained Gen. Humberto Ortega, the brother of former
president Daniel Ortega, as army chief.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Galeano was asked
what the Contras' specific conditions before demobilizing were. He
replied: ``A state of law with guarantees that we don't have a
politicized army.''
   Galeano said it was up to Mrs. Chamorro's administration to find
a formula for meeting those conditions, but hinted the rebels
wanted the Sandinista army virtually abolished and suggested it be
temporarily replaced by an international security force.
   ``The problem is not one man _ Humberto Ortega. The problem is
the whole repressive structure of the army. If they remove Humberto
Ortega, there are 10 or 20 other Humberto Ortegas to replace him,''
Galeano added.
   No. 2 rebel leader Oscar Sovalbarro, who signed last week's
demobilization accord for the Contras, was asked if he believed the
rebels will demobilized by June 10.
   ``If the climate of confidence necessary for these men to give
up their arms is improved, it could be done,'' he replied.
   He talked of ``reforming'' the Sandinista-dominated army instead
of abolishing it. Like Galeano, he insisted that demobilization is
the voluntary decision of each fighter.
   But that now appears to be a more uncertain prospect than ever.
   Said one regional commander, who identified himself only as
Jackson: ``I for one am not disposed to hand over my rifle. I'd
rather take to the mountains, live in the jungle with my comrades
until our conditions are met.''

   Edward L. Rowny quit Thursday as a senior arms
control adviser to President Bush. Sources said Rowny resigned over
what he felt was undue haste in completing a treaty with the Soviet
Union to limit strategic nuclear missiles.
   Bush acccepted Rowny's resignation with ``deep regret'' and said
he had always valued his adviser's candor and loyalty.
   ``You have served as one of the principal architects of the
American policy of peace through strength,'' Bush said in a letter
the 73-year-old, retired Army lieutenant general.
   Rowny, who will leave his post on June 30, said in a statement
that he looked forward ``to contributing to his (Bush's) efforts
for peace through strength.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Rowny had authorized
him to say there was no disagreement or reason to leave other than
a desire to take two positions outside government.
   But the sources, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,
said Rowny disagreed with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
over Baker's pushing to complete the treaty at what Rowny felt was
too fast a pace.
   ``He wanted to slow down START (the Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty talks) before we give up too much,'' said a source outside
the government and close to Rowny. ``He is saying, `What's the
rush?'''
   The administration would like to conclude at least a framework
agreement on the key START issues for initialing by Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit meeting that begins
in Washington May 30.
   ``He is saying, by resigning, `Why sacrifice the national
security in a rush to get a glad hand and a smile from
Gorbachev?''' the source said. ``He will now make that point as a
private individual.''
   Rowny will become a senior associate at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a private research group in Washington,
and a visiting professor at George Washington University.
   The United States and the Soviet Union remain far apart on
several key issues in the START talks. Among them are the
procedures for verifying that missile reductions have been carried
out, whether to impose ceilings on land-based and sea-launched
cruise missiles with multiple nuclear warheads and what kind of
limitations to place on cruise missiles carried aboard jet fighters.
   Rowny has also strongly advocated concluding a treaty between
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact to
reduce sharply U.S. and Soviet troops, tanks, artillery and other
non-nuclear weapons in Europe.
   An administration official, also insisting on anonymity, said
Rowny was resigning because he had limited influence within the
administration in projecting his views.
   Rowny was an adviser to both Bush and Baker. He had also served
as an arms control adviser to then-President Reagan and his
secretary of state, George P. Shultz.
   In 1979, he quit as an arms control specialist for the Carter
administration during negotiations to conclude the 1979 Strategic
Arms Limitation Treaty.
   That U.S.-Soviet accord, which imposed some limitations on
long-range nuclear weapons, was denounced by Reagan as he sought
the presidency. After Reagan's election, Rowny returned to the
government to serve as chief START negotiator.
   In a recent speech, Rowny said the Soviets would have a
completely modern, formidable nuclear force even after carrying out
cutbacks under a START treaty with the United States.
   The cutbacks, now being negotiated in Geneva, would trim the
size of the Soviet arsenal, Rowny told the Reserve Officers'
Association.
   In the meantime, he said, Soviet strategic forces _ long-range
nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines _ are being upgraded to
provide for a powerful arsenal after the treaty takes effect.
   ``The U.S.S.R. is intent on retaining its claim to the status of
a superpower equal to the United States that only first-rate
nuclear forces can provide,'' Rowny said.
   The Soviets are upgrading their strategic nuclear weapons far
more aggressively than is the United States, he said. For instance,
Rowny said, the Soviets are making their land-based SS-18
intercontinental ballistic missiles more accurate and more powerful
while continuing to deploy SS-24s with 10 warheads both in silos
and as mobile weapons.

   A figure in the criminal case against Mayor
Marion Barry was sentenced to a year on probation and fined $1,000
Thursday after pleading guilty to aiding and abetting a possession
of drugs.
   James McWilliams also was ordered to serve 50 hours of community
service by U.S. Magistrate Deborah Robinson. He could have faced up
to one year imprisonment and a $100,000 fine.
   McWilliams told the magistrate he accepts ``full
responsibility'' for his actions, will ``try to make amends'' and
that he had learned ``a bitter, costly lesson.'' Details of his
case are under seal.
   McWilliams pleaded guilty Jan. 30 and agreed to cooperate with
the U.S. attorney's office in the criminal investigation of Barry.
   McWilliams is an employee of the District of Columbia Department
of Public Works.
   In December 1988, he went to a Ramada Inn in the district and
loaned his car to Barry associate Charles Lewis so that Lewis could
go purchase drugs, prosecutors in the McWilliams case have said.
The mayor is accused of four counts of cocaine possession in
connection with his visits to the Ramada.
   Lewis, the government's chief witness against Barry, said in
court in November that he was paid $140 by Barry in December 1988
so that Lewis could buy crack cocaine for the mayor.
   Lewis pleaded guilty to conspiring to buy crack for the mayor
and to distributing cocaine to others and agreed to testify on
behalf of the government against Barry.
   Barry faces trial June 4 on five counts of cocaine possession
and three counts of making false statements before a federal grand
jury. In his testimony, Barry said he was not aware that Lewis was
involved with drugs and denied that he and Lewis had given each
other drugs.

   ABC's ``Good Morning America'' garnered its 16th
consecutive ratings victory Thursday and for the second time in a
month, NBC's once-dominant ``Today'' had its lowest ratings in
nearly three years.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.3 rating last week, the same as for the
previous week. But second-place ``Today'' dropped by two-tenths of
a ratings point to a 3.3 average last week, according to A.C.
Nielsen Co. audience estimates.
   ``Today'' had the same 3.3 average in the week ending April 2.
An NBC official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that was
the show's lowest rating since August 1983.
   The show's ratings decline and the rise of ``Good Morning
America'' began in January, when Deborah Norville succeeded Jane
Pauley as co-host of ``Today.''
   ``CBS This Morning'' remained a distant third in last week's
ratings, averaging a 2.4. Each ratings point represents 921,000
homes.

<TEXT>
   Two weeks before the World War II allies meet
to discuss Germany's military future, East Germany said Thursday it
does not want a united Germany to be part of NATO.
   In a parliamentary session, Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
said his reluctance until now to set out an official East German
stance toward NATO was no accident. ``We want to overcome the
military blocs, not rearrange them,'' he said.
   The United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France meet in
Bonn on May 5 to resolve the international aspects of German
unification, including the sticky issue of its military standing.
   Asked about East Germany's stance toward NATO, East German
Foreign Minister Markus Meckel said: ``Membership in NATO is not
our goal.'' He spoke in favor of building up a new European
security system.
   However, since unification will come about sooner than a new
system, he said, a temporary solution may be necessary. If under
those circumstances East Germany has to consider membership in
NATO, then the Western alliance would have to substantially change
its strategy, Meckel said.
   He did not say how NATO would have to change.
   President Bush and the entire NATO alliance have insisted the
new Germany be a full member of NATO, including its military arm.
The Soviet Union has dropped its insistence that Germany be
neutralized but suggested overlapping NATO and Warsaw Pact
membership.
   Also Thursday in parliament, a new oath of allegiance for
soldiers was passed that strikes the word ``socialism'' and uses
``peace'' instead.
   The new oath says soldiers must do everything in their power to
``maintain peace and protect'' East Germany. That and similar
wording replaces passages that for more than 40 years referred to
``fighting alongside the armies of the Soviet Union and our
Socialist allies.''
   As the two Germanys scramble to accomplish monetary, economic
and social union by July 2, heated debates are taking place over
how to bring the mighty West German mark into East Germany.
   West Germany's proposal of a 1-1 exchange rate for wages,
pensions and savings up to 4,000 marks ($2,300) is at the heart of
the discussion.
   The East German government has said it will push for a higher
ceiling for the savings exchange.
   De Maiziere addressed the issue in parliament Thursday.
   ``We have already made some achievements, considering there is
now a willingness to exchange wages at 1-1 in a country where until
now there was a rate of 1 (West mark) to 4.65 (East marks),'' de
Maiziere said, drawing a round of applause.
   Commenting on charges that under the current plan East Germans
would become second-class citizens, de Maiziere quipped: ``Until
now we have been third- or fourth-class.''
   In West Germany, the central bank said it could not rule out a
tax increase to finance unification with East Germany.
   ``We cannot simply discount a tax increase out of hand,''
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said at a conference in Bonn.
He added that all other options for financing the union would be
tried first.
   The bank said the proposed exchange rate represents the limits
of what West Germany's economy can take.
   The bank had suggested a 2-1 swap, saying a 1-1 exchange would
dilute the value of the West German mark and possibly cause high
inflation and rising interest rates.

<HEAD>More Control Over Intelligence Agency Demanded</HEAD>

   Civil liberties groups on Thursday demanded
tighter control of Britain's MI5 intelligence service after the
23-nation Council of Europe found it guilty of breaching human
rights.
   In a ruling this week, the West European nations censured MI5
for spying on two former officers of the British National Council
for Civil Liberties in the 1970s and classifying them and their
organization as subversives.
   The council's court, the European Court of Human Rights based in
Strasbourg, France, has found Britain guilty more often than any
other country.
   The latest ruling sparked a new dispute over what critics see as
a warping of civil liberties in Britain and resistance to reform by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Charter 88, a pressure group that includes retired judges,
academics and politicians, said the ruling underlined the need for
Britain to have a written constitution and Bill of Rights.
   One of the people classified as subversive and a Communist
sympathizer, Harriet Harman, is now a senior legislator in the
opposition Labor Party and likely to become a Cabinet minister if
the socialists win the next election.
   The other, Patricia Hewitt, was press secretary to Labor Party
leader Neil Kinnock in the 1980s.
   The two women demanded Thursday that MI5 destroy files it
presumably has amassed on them through surveillance, including
suspected phone taps.
   Ms. Harman said the surveillance ``casts a shadow over me which
is totally unjustified and which I bitterly resent.''
   ``I want my file destroyed,'' she said at a news conference at
the House of Commons.
   She urged that MI5 and MI6, which gathers intelligence abroad,
should be directly accountable to Parliament in the style of the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
   The demand was echoed by the civil liberties council and
legislators from both parties, who consider current controls too
lax.
   The government made no comment in accordance with its practice
of refusing to discuss the security services.
   According to leaks to British newspapers, MI5 has removed the
civil liberties council from its classified list.
   The government has also said it has rectified the human rights
charge with a 1989 Security Service Act.
   This laid out a charter for MI5 for the first time, provided for
a complaints tribunal for people who suspect they are under
surveillance and it required agents to get a Cabinet minister's
approval to bug or break into buildings.
   But MI5 continues to report only to the prime minister and
another Cabinet minister, the home secretary, not Parliament.
   MI5 has been accused in recent years of infringing civil
liberties by tapping telephones of labor union activists and
anti-nuclear campaigners. According to the memoirs of a retired
agent, Peter Wright, MI5 tried to destabilize the Labor government
of Harold Wilson in the 60s and the 70s.
   Britain has been convicted of 22 violations of the European
Human Rights Convention including several on issues related to
Northern Ireland, such as no-jury trials and imprisonment of
terrorists.
   Britain's frequent run-ins result partly from the fact that it
is the only country in Western Europe that has no written bill of
rights or constitution.
   Human rights issues are automatically transferred to the
European Court instead of being filtered through domestic courts.
   The nearest thing in Britain to a constitution is a 1689
declaration accepted by William III that ensured the ascendancy of
parliamentary power over royal power.

   A college freshman who rescued a pilot from a
burning seaplane that crashed along a Maine lakeshore was among 19
people recognized Thursday by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission.
   ``I didn't plan to be a hero. It just kind of happened,'' Jonah
Rosenfield, 18, said in a telephone interview from Brunswick,
Maine, where he attends Bowdoin College. ``I'm so glad I could help
that man. I'd do it again in a second for anyone.''
   Rosenfield, from South Euclid, Ohio, is among 7,443 Americans
and Canadians honored by the commission since its founding by
industrialist Andrew Carnegie in 1904.
   The award carries a $2,500 cash grant and a medal. More than
$18.4 million has been awarded in one-time payments and pensions to
the heroes or their survivors.
   Five of those honored Thursday died in performing their heroic
acts.
   Rosenfield was relaxing on the shores of Lily Pond in Deer Isle,
Maine, on Aug. 25 when the single-engine plane, which had just
taken off, crashed into trees less than 30 feet from him and other
college students.
   ``I remember seeing the plane burn and the guy trapped inside
the cockpit engulfed in smoke,'' he said. ``I remember thinking,
`There's no way you can let him stay in there.' ''
   Rosenfield said despite his friends' shouts to stay back, he ran
to the plane, opened the door and pulled out the dazed pilot, John
H. Reid, 64, of Cape Cod, Mass.
   ``I accidentally dropped him in the lake, which actually was a
good thing. He was on fire, but I didn't realize it,'' Rosenfield
said.
   Reid was hospitalized for almost a month for treatment of
second- and third-degree burns. Rosenfield was not hurt.
   The commission identified the other heroes as:
   _David M. Nyman, 31, of Anchorage, Alaska, who dragged an
injured climbing partner down a mountain in Denali National Park on
April 21, 1989. The rescue effort, slowed by a snowstorm and
avalanches, took five days.
   _Melody S. Killen, 29, of St. Helens, Ore., and Norman J.

girls from drowning in the Pacific Ocean in Ocean Park, Wash., on
July 30. Thomas, the grandfather of one of the girls, died two days
later.

   Poverty and despair facing many American
children are not only personal tragedies but ``a staggering
national tragedy'' that threatens America's future, a federal
commission reported Thursday.
   The National Commission on Children said in an interim report
that children have become the poorest age group in the United
States, with one child in five living below the poverty level.
   It said the childhood poverty more than any other factor places
young Americans at risk for a range of long-term problems,
including poor health, failure in school, teen-age pregnancy, crime
and drugs.
   As a result, it said, many of today's children will reach
adulthood unhealthy, illiterate and unemployable.
   ``The health and vitality of our economy and our democracy are
increasingly in danger,'' Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chairman
of the panel, said in releasing the report.
   ``These are personal tragedies,'' Rockefeller said. ``They are
also a staggering national tragedy.''
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
have very deep concerns about the children of this country and the
poverty level that they may be facing. ... We know this problem
exists.''
   He added, ``It's always constructive to get the best kind of
analysis we can over how deep and how wide this problem is.''
   The commission was established by Congress, and its members were
appointed by the president and House and Senate leaders. It made no
recommendations in its interim report, which was required by law,
but its findings are expected to form the basis for suggestions for
new spending next year.
   At a news conference with other members of the commission,
Rockefeller acknowledged the recommendations likely will be
expensive. But commission members said the recommendations will
involve efforts by business and families as well as government, and
are needed to head off future costs to society.
   ``We know these kids are going to cost us billions in the
future,'' if not helped, said Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, professor of
pediatrics at Harvard University. ``They're going to be the
terrorists of the future.''
   In the report, Rockefeller said it is a tragic irony that at a
time of prosperity, the United States ``seems to be failing its
children.''
   ``The evidence of this failure is pervasive,'' he said. ``The
seriousness of the problems afflicting many of the nation's
children and their families is now largely beyond debate.''
   The report cited an array of jarring statistics, all of them
previously reported, about childhood poverty:
   _ Malnutrition affects nearly a half-million children, and
100,000 children are homeless.
   _ Among black and Hispanic children, poverty is even worse. The
poverty rate in 1987, the year the report cited, was 15 percent for
white children but 45 percent for black children and 39 percent for
Hispanic children.
   _ One of every four rural child is poor, and rural families are
less likely than urban ones to receive public assistance.
   U.S. children on average are economically better off now than
they were in the 1960s, primarily due to rising family incomes
through 1973 and the trend toward smaller families, it said. But
those figures do not reflect the growing disparity among families,
the report said.
   The 20 percent of children living in a poor family was up from
15 percent in 1970, it said.
   The problems of poor children are compounded by a patchwork
health care system that omits many, with ``harsh and senseless
consequences,'' the commission said.
   More than 10 million children have no health insurance coverage,
including Medicaid, the report said. Every day 100 babies die
before reaching their first birthday, many for lack of prenatal
care, it said.
   The report lamented the rise in single-parent families, which
are more likely to be below the poverty level, the pervasiveness of
drugs, and the school dropout rate. About one in four 18- and
19-year olds have dropped out of school, it said, and among
Hispanics the figure was 45 percent.
   The report said that at a time when the conditions of children
call for more flexibility in the schools, many school systems are
becoming more rigid in their operation and less accommodating to
students' needs.

   About 30 people demonstrated at the
headquarters of an insurance company that has withheld $1.1 million
in payments from a Toledo center that uses recreational activities
to treat Alzheimer's disease patients.
   The protesters presented Nationwide Insurance officials with
petitions demanding a review of the dispute, prompted by the
insurer's finding that the treatments aren't covered by Medicare.
   The treatment center, Intergenerational Services Inc., has
challenged the insurance company's decision to reject its claims,
and an internal review of the contested claims is expected to be
finished by Monday, a company official told the demonstrators.
   But the official, William P. Ramsey, vice president of
Nationwide's Medicare operations, told the demonstrators he agreed
with the original decision to reject the claims. Columbus-based
Nationwide Insurance administers Medicare Plan B in the area.
   Since October, the insurer has rejected 40,000 claims worth $1.1
million filed by Intergenerational Services for psychotherapeutic
services to Alzheimer's patients. The claims involve some 2,000
families.
   Nationwide says the claims are for recreational and social
services and so fail to qualify as psychotherapy under Medicare
guidelines.
   The Rev. Al Baumann, president of the board of
Intergenerational, said its program _ in which patients reminisce
about the past, sing songs and examine objects that will spark
their memories _ is psychotherapy.
   ``We're trying to get them to relate to an object and to people
because their problem is mainly depression and not being in touch
with reality,'' he said. ``Constant reinforcement is a form of
behavior modification ... and that is psychotherapy.''
   Alzheimer's is an irreversible disease characterized by the
degeneration of brain cells and often leads to severe dementia.
   If the company review goes against Intergenerational, the
program could appeal to an administrative law judge.
   But Baumann said after Monday, it will be too late.
   Eighty percent of the agency's budget is Medicare money, he said.
   ``At the end of April, we're out of money,'' Baumann said.
``Sure, we could get into a court thing, which would take a year,
two years. It's not good because ultimately, we may win the battle,
but lose the war.''
   Among the protesters was Judith Messinger, chairman of the
Advocates for Alzheimer's Victims who said that no matter what the
fate of the agency, her organization would pursue the case.
   ``Quite clearly, we don't intend to give up on this. Other
Alzheimer's patients not only in Ohio, but in other states are
going through the same kind of problems. They'll be looking at us
to see how this is settled,'' she said.
   The protesters also took their case to Gov. Richard Celeste,
delivering petitions with 10,000 signatures.
   Spokesman Reuven Carlyle said the petitions had been received,
but that there was little the state could do because Medicare is a
federal program.

   Pesticide-laced insect bait rained upon
neighborhoods west of Miami on Thursday as authorities sought to
snuff out a Mediterreanean fruit fly infestation that could
threaten Florida's $1.4 billion citrus industry.
   It was the first assault on Medflies in Dade County in three
years. State biologists, meanwhile, examined fly traps about 25
miles north to check the scope of the infestation.
   ``Hopefully what we've done is the beginning of the end for the
Medflies,'' said Maeve McConnell, a spokeswoman for the eradication
task force in Miami. ``We're keep our fingers crossed.''
   A helicopter loaded with syrupy insect bait spiked with
malathion blanketed a 16-square-mile area near Miami International
Airport, where the first flies were found last week.
   Ms. McConnell said experts from the Florida Department of
Agriculture will be checking traps around Fort Lauderdale this week
for any indication of more Medflies, whose larvae eat the core of
fruit. A female Medfly found Tuesday near Port Everglades was found
not to be pregnant, she said.
   Officials have speculated the fly could have been trapped inside
a ship or plane.
   As of late Thursday, 10 Medflies had been discovered in South
Florida. Scientists have determined that for every Medfly found in
a trap, there are probably 500 to 1,000 fles nearby, according to
the state agriculture department.
   Present plans call for three more aerial applications in the
Miami area in May with a mixture of about 2.4 ounces of malathion
per acre. That compares with 3.1 ounces of malathion _ or about
four tablespoons _ per acre sprayed throughout Florida to control
mosquitoes.
   The use of malathion to kill Medflies has caused controversy in
southern California, but there were no organized protests reported
in Miami on Thursday.
   A few school officials and parents complained that afternoon
spraying coincided with release of students from class, and one
environmentalist blasted the effort.
   ``There is no choice involved here. The malathion is sprayed
directly on places where people live. I have a problem with that,''
said Joseph Podgor Jr., Dade County chairman of the Friends of the
Everglades. ``At least if it's sprayed on fruits you can wash it
off.''
   Officials advised remaining indoors and keeping small pets under
cover during spraying. Malathion, which can irritate eyes, also can
damage paint on automobiles. Water-use restrictions were waived for
the spray zone to allow residents to rinse their cars.
   Next month, millions of sterile Medflies will be released in a
slightly larger area in an attempt to break the insect's one-month
breeding cyle.
   A quarantine went into effect Wednesday for about a
100-square-mile area west of downtown Miami that requires
inspection of all Medfly-host produce _ including some 250
varieties of fruits and vegetables _ leaving the area.
   The last Medfly spraying in Florida occurred in 1987 in Hialeah,
a city neighboring Miami.

   A man who was beset by burglaries and rigged a
shotgun booby trap that killed an intruder in his warehouse will
get a deferred sentence for reckless manslaughter under a plea
bargain announced Thursday.
   Philip Connaghan, 46, will spend no time in jail and his record
will be cleared of the conviction if he has no further run-ins with
the law, Denver District Attorney Norm Early said.
   The deal is subject to approval by a judge, who does not have
the option of accepting the guilty plea alone and imposing a
sentence where none is recommended, Early said.
   Early said he decided to file a felony charge of reckless
manslaughter and a misdemeanor charge of violating the state's
booby-trap law because the facts failed to support filing first- or
second-degree murder charges. Connaghan will plead guilty to the
charges under the agreement.
   ``Philip Connaghan, an otherwise law-abiding citizen ...
knowingly stepped beyond the lawful means of protecting property
because of the severe frustration created by repeated
victimization,'' Early said.
   Michael McComb, 19, was killed by a blast from a 12-gauge
shotgun on April 14 after he and three juveniles broke into the
warehouse that Connaghan rented.
   The three youths, who have been released into their parents'
custody, face possible burglary charges.
   Connaghan, who was in Kansas on vacation when McComb was killed,
surrendered on April 20 and was released on $5,000 bond Monday.
   Under the plea bargain, Early will recommend that Connaghan be
given a deferred sentence and be required to perform community
service.
   If the judge rejects the agreement, Early said his office would
have to consider new charges.
   Connaghan was pleased with Early's decision, said Connaghan's
lawyer, Bob Ransome. Connaghan will not comment until it is
resolved, Ransome said.
   Before the April 14 killing, the warehouse, which contained
about $7,000 worth of Connaghan's tools, had been burglarized six
times, Ransome said.
   ``It became a battle of wits,'' Ransome said. ``He couldn't get
any satisfaction.''
   Connaghan, a handyman, set two shotgun booby traps in the
warehouse in January after it was burglarized a fourth time,
Ransome said.
   During the fifth burglary, in March, one of the booby traps was
triggered, but malfunctioned, and Connaghan ``felt terribly
relieved that it didn't work,'' Ransome said.
   He dismantled one of the traps and spent about 200 hours
repairing damage to the warehouse that was caused by the burglars.
Then, he went on a short vacation to Kansas, but left the second
booby trap rigged, Ransome said.
   ``I think when he got in his car he just drove away. He thought
about turning around, and then thought, `Well, they're not going to
hit me on Easter,''' Ransome said.
   After learning of McComb's death, Connaghan felt remorse.
   ``He realizes that even though the young man was burglarizing
him ... in fact, he was a human being and someone's son,'' Ransome
said.
   The booby-trap case aroused sympathy for Connaghan from people
who have become frustrated with rising crime rates.
   Telephone calls to the residence of Tim and Rosalie McComb,
parents of Michael McComb, went unanswered Thursday.
   But in a letter to the editor published Wednesday in The Denver
Post, the McCombs defended their son, and criticized those who
offered sympathy and support to Connaghan.
   ``Our son fell off life's path for a period of time. He was on
the road back when he was robbed of the chance to justify his
life,'' they wrote ``Everyone who knew Mike loved him. He was not
scum, he was not a career criminal, nor, to our knowledge, was he
convicted of anything other than being a teen-ager trying to make
his way in a world gone mad.
   ``As Colorado business owners for 30 years, we have experienced
the anger of being broken into many times. However, killing anyone
has never crossed our minds. Alarms and insurance are certainly a
less barbaric method of prevention. By the way, burglary has not
been proven against Michael.''

<HEAD>Department Approves Eastern Route Transfer, Continental
Houston-Tokyo Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday approved the sale
of most Eastern Airlines foreign routes to American Airlines and
awarded a new Texas-Tokyo route to Continental Airlines.
   President Bush has authority to reject either deal if he
believes it will harm U.S. national security or foreign policy
interests.
   The Transportation Department's decision, made tentatively 10
days ago, includes transfer to American of Eastern's Central and
South American routes as well as its Miami-Madrid flights and a
Miami-London route operated by Continental, eastern's sister
corporation in the Texas Air group.
   The department refused to allow transfer of Eastern's
Florida-Toronto route as part of the deal, saying it would examine
the proposal further and consider selecting a carier other than
American to operate the service. Three other carriers have
indicated an interest, officials said.
   A bankruptcy judge last week turned over Eastern to a trustee,
removing it from the control of Texas Air Corp. owner Frank Lorenzo.
   Eastern's previous management had said sale of the routes to
American, approved by the bankruptcy court, was key to Eastern's
financial plans. American had agreed to pay $349 million, but that
sum included the Toronto route.
   The awarding of a Houston-Honolulu-Tokyo route to Continental
ended competition among six carriers for a service formerly
belonging to Federal Express.
   The cargo service, lost by Federal Express when it took over
Flying Tiger Line which already had U.S.-Japan cargo authority, has
been expanded to include both passenger and cargo service.
   Continental and three other carriers _ America West, Aloha and
Delta _ proposed a Honolulu-Tokyo route to replace the Federal
Express service. Hawaiian Airlines wanted to run the service
between Honlulu and Nagoya and American proposed a service between
San Jose, Calif., and Tokyo.
   The department said the Honolulu-Tokyo market provided the
greater pbulic benefit and Continental was selected largely because
it proposed to serve Houston with the same planes it flies to Japan.
   No single-plane service now exists between Houston and Tokyo,
and Continental's cargo service should significantly increase
Houston's exports to Japan, the department said.
   If Continental decides it does not want the route, America West
will be allowed to operate its proposed route between Tokyo,
Honolulu and Las Vegas, Nev. and Phoenix, Ariz., the department
said.

   Notebooks were tossed in the trash and job
postings tacked on the bulletin board Thursday at the St. Louis
Sun, the new metropolitan newspaper that abruptly stopped
publishing after only seven months of business.
   The newspaper didn't publish a farewell edition. Its last
edition, the 213th, appeared Wednesday morning.
   The sudden demise came as a shock to employees, readers,
newspaper analysts and others, and it also underscored the nagging
slowdown that has hit the newspaper industry.
   Local and national newspaper advertising around the country grew
just 4 percent last year, its smallest increase in more than five
years. Daily newspaper circulation has been stagnant at about 62
million for a decade and it's been declining the past two years.
   About the only thing going well for newspaper publishers is that
the price of newsprint is about 23 percent lower than last year.
   ``The newspaper market is in turmoil,'' said Ralph Ingersoll II,
chairman and chief executive officer of Ingersoll Publications Co.
and editor-in-chief of the Sun. ``This is at least the third such
crisis I have personally lived through.''
   But Ingersoll, who personally directed the creation of the Sun,
which debuted Sept. 25, 1989, said he didn't know what role the
industrywide troubles played in determining the Sun's fate.
   ``I think it had a direct impact,'' said Kenneth Berents, a
stock analyst in Baltimore with Alex Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. ``It's
tough enough to do a startup, but it's almost impossible to do in a
bad climate like this.''
   When he first set out to bring a second daily newspaper to St.
Louis to compete with the 111-year-old St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
Ingersoll said he hoped his effort would help invigorate the
newspaper industry.
   And even though the Sun didn't make it, he hasn't ruled out the
possibility of trying it again somewhere else. Certainly, no one
else is going to try it, analysts say.
   ``First of all, Ingersoll was a maverick and there aren't many
mavericks around. Second of all, this is a very unfriendly
environment for newspapers right now,'' said Lisa Donneson, a stock
analyst in New York for County NatWest USA.
   At a Wednesday news conference, Ingersoll said the reason the
Sun didn't last longer was its failure to sell enough newspapers
out of vending boxes and newspaper racks in stores.
   Ingersoll expected to sell most of the news newspapers on a
single-copy basis, but soon after the paper started, home-delivery
sales outnumbered single-copy sales by a two-to-one margin.
   That cost the Sun $5 million more than planned. Ingersoll said
the newspaper had spent more than $25 million to start up, but he
didn't know how much of that would be recoverable.
   On Thursday, in the Sun newsroom where windows overlook the
Gateway Arch and clocks tell what time it is in Tokyo, some of the
newspaper's 194 full-time employees cleaned out their desks and
pondered the future.
   Some showed up in white shirts and ties and talked about job
interviews they had just returned from. Some still peppered their
sentences with words like ``shocked'' and ``stunned.'' And some
talked about Thursday's softball game, the first of the season.
   ``We're going to play as far as I know,'' said the Sun's
Business editor Dan Kadlec, who was in the office with his wife and
five-month-old daughter. He left a job at USA Today and moved to
St. Louis from New York to work for the Sun.
   ``I haven't even unpacked,'' he said.
   Some reporters said they were upset that Ingersoll didn't give
the Sun more time to prove itself and more notice of the
newspaper's collapse. They said the general consensus in the office
was that they had two years to try to make it.
   ``I knew that this newspaper might not be around after
two-and-a-half years, but it didn't think he would pull the plug so
soon,'' said Ellen Whitford, a general assignment reporter who came
to the Sun from Virginia.
   ``I'm going to start applying for jobs, but the market's pretty
bad, so I guess you could say I feel pretty grim at the moment,''
she said.
   Ingersoll said all employees would be given at least 12 weeks
severance pay and efforts would be made to find them jobs at other
newspapers in the Ingersoll chain.
   Meetings were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday to discuss
parting benefits.

   The Interior Department will reopen, refurbish
and manage a 2.5 million gallon oil spill test tank at a Navy site
in Leonardo, N.J., according to an agreement signed Thursday.
   The tank, which fell into disrepair after closing in 1987, is
the only one of its kind in North America that accommodates
full-scale oil cleanup equipment. Research there has produced most
of what experts know about oil spill response.
   Officials hope to reopen the Oil and Hazardous Materials
Simulated Environmental Test Tank near the Earle Naval Weapons
Station by 1991.
   ``This is a milestone event for oil spill containment and
cleanup research operations,'' said Barry A. Williamson, director
of the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service.
   He and Navy Rear Adm. Robert Ailes, deputy commander of the
Naval Sea Systems Command, signed documents Thursday transferring
control of the facility to the Minerals Management Service for five
years.
   Following oil spills in Prince William Sound in Alaska and along
the Delaware River, politicians began focusing attention on
reactivating the wave-generating tank, which simulates open water
conditions for testing prototypes of booms and small skimmers.
   Jim Nash, a former engineer at the facility, has estimated it
will cost $500,000 to resume operations. at the tank, which is 667
feet long, 67 feet wide and 8 feet deep.
   According to Thursday's agreement, the cost of operating the
tank will be shared by the Minerals Management Service, the Coast
Guard and Environment Canada, which is Canada's environmental
department.
   Angela Calos, a spokeswoman for Minerals Management, declined to
disclose how much money is being set aside for the project, but
said the American Petroleum Institute indicated willingness to
underwrite some research at the facility.

   Now playing center field at Yankee Stadium ...
Billy Joel.
   The five-time Grammy winner, whose most recent album is the
former No. 1 ``Storm Front,'' will become the first rocker to
headline a show at the stadium, as far as New York Yankees
officials can determine. Two popes and several heavyweight fights
have sold out the stadium, but no musical acts.
   Joel will play a June 22 concert at the Bronx ballpark, the
playground of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey
Mantle, to name a few. His piano will be set up in left-center
field.
   The show, for an expected 57,000 fans, will be a homecoming for
the native New Yorker.
   ``It's the House that Ruth Built, man. It's a magic place,''
Joel said in a telephone interview from Chicago. ``The day we set
up, I'm going to walk out to the mound and do a little pitching,
maybe shag a few flies.''
   The show will be part of Joel's second swing through the United
States on a tour that began last year. On May 5, he begins a
one-month European tour.
   Joel, who early in his career played under the nom-de-tune Billy
Martin, said there's a possibility of a second show at the stadium
if the first sells out.
   The show will be co-promoted by Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner, whose biggest concern was the Yankees infield.
   Joel, who first visited the stadium for a late '50s World Series
game, agreed. ``That's understandable. That grass is sacrosanct,''
he said.
   Joel's group will not be the first band to play at the stadium.
The Beach Boys and the Charlie Daniels Band have performed
following Yankee games in recent years.

   Another day of thunderstorms with heavy rain over the southern
Plains caused severe flooding Thursday in Texas, and more high
temperature records were toppled in the northeastern quarter of the
nation.
   Snow fell along the northern Rockies.
   San Antonio, Texas, got 2.5 inches of rain in one hour near
sunrise, the National Weather Service said. From Wednesday evening
to Thursday afternoon, more than 5 inches of rain fell across Clay
County, Texas.
   Severe flooding was reported in the counties to the west and
southwest of Fort Worth, and hundreds of people were evacuated,
especially in the city of Brownwood, where most major traffic
routes were under water.
   Flooding also continued in south-central Oklahoma, where 6 or
more inches of rain had fallen fell since Wednesday morning.
   Elsewhere during the afternoon, showers and thunderstorms
extended from west-central Missouri across southeastern Kansas,
Oklahoma, the lower Texas Gulf Coast and south-central Texas.
   Showers reached from central Colorado across north-central
Wyoming, and over northern Montana.
   Showers turned to snow at higher elevations of Colorado and
Wyoming. Three inches of snow fell overnight on the continental
divide west of Denver and as much as 8 additional inches of snow
was possible during the night in Colorado's higher elevations.
   Rain also fell over northwestern Minnesota, eastern North Dakota
and northeastern South Dakota, and from northwestern Oregon into
southwestern Washington state.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. CDT, all in
Texas, included 3 inches at Beeville, 2.58 inches at Killeen, 2.23
inches at Austin, 1.94 inches at Waco, 1.74 inches at Dallas and
1.39 inches at Austin.
   In central Kansas, a tornado that swept through Ellis County on
Wednesday evening destroyed six homes and several outbuildings,
officials said Thursday. No injuries were reported.
   Record highs Thursday were 91 in downtown Baltimore; 85 at
Flint, Mich.; 84 at Marquette, Mich.; 90 at Philadelphia; 85 at
Syracuse, N.Y.; and 88 at Wilmington, Del. Alpena, Mich., tied its
record of 79 and Williamsport, Pa., tied its record of 91.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 24 at Burns, Ore.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32 at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 99 at Palm Springs, Calif.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Thursday that the United States is reviewing loans granted to Iraq
that allow it to buy American farm products.
   Baker, in comments to reporters after he met with Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez, said officials are ``reviewing the
situation with respect to the relationship'' with Iraq,
``particularly ... the matter of CCC credits.''
   Through the Agriculture Department's Commodity Credit
Corporation, the United States guaranteed loans for Iraq to buy
$500 million in agricultural products last November. Baghdad has
asked for another $500 million in credits.
   Baker said stronger sanctions, similar to those imposed against
Libya and Iran, ``have never been under consideration.''
   He spoke shortly after Assistant Secretary of State John H.
Kelly reiterated to a House committee the Bush administration's
objection to sanctions against Iraq that have been proposed in
Congress.
   Iraq's leader, Saddam Hussein, has reportedly used chemical
weapons to kill thousands of Kurds living in his nation _ a charge
the Iraqi government denies _ and has threatened to use the weapons
against Israel.
   ``While we do not rule out appropriate responses to recent
actions by the government of Iraq, we are not prepared to see
economic and trade sanctions legislatively imposed at this point,''
Kelly told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle
East.
   His comments were met with incredulity by several committee
members.
   ``There is an Alice-in-Wonderland element in your testimony,''
Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., told Kelly. ``At what point will the
United States recognize that (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein is
not a nice guy?''
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif. and the author of legislation that
would bar giving Iraq the agricultural credits and disallow the
sale of items, such as computers, that can be used for both
military and peaceful purposes, asked what would trigger stronger
administration action.
   Kelly acknowledged the Saddam's recent behavior had damaged
relations between Washington and Baghdad.
   ``Recent developments, taken together, are serious,'' he said.
``They raise questions in our minds about the intentions of Iraq's
leaders towards such international commitments as the
non-proliferaton treaty and the Geneva protocol banning the use of
chemical weapons.''
   Still, Kelly said the administration doesn't think legislatively
imposed sanctions would work to temper Saddam's actions. In fact,
they would hurt the U.S. trade deficit by reducing U.S. exports.
   Kelly said the United States is interested in seeing Saddam
change his ways. There is a ``possibility of improvement and we
want to encourage that improvement,'' he said.
   In general, the United States is interested in having relations
with Iraq because of the country importance in the Middle East. The
country is second to Saudi Arabia in oil reserves.

   In 1944, Jews imprisoned in a Nazi concentration
camp in Czechoslovakia performed Verdi's ``Requiem,'' the Catholic
Mass for the dead, and in a few days were themselves deported to
death camps.
   To commemorate those who participated in the ``Requiem'' at the
Terezin camp near Prague, the Verdi work was being performed
Thursday night at Carnegie Hall by the 150-member New York Choral
Society, with Robert DeCormier conducting.
   The 1944 performance was organized as the Germans were losing
ground in World War II and trying to cover up atrocities in the
concentration camps. The Terezin camp's Nazi commandant wanted a
program to show the Red Cross that Terezin was a ``model ghetto.''
   The young conductor Rafael Schachter, held at Terezin, organized
Jews in the camp to perform the work. Their lines, in Latin,
included, ``Therefore, when the Judge shall be seated, nothing
shall be held hidden any longer, no wrong shall remain unpunished.''
   Despite the camp commandant's promise to Schachter, he and
nearly all the 150 singers and musicians were deported to death
camps a few days after the performance.
   The Carnegie Hall performance was being introduced by Rabbi
Alexander Schindler, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, as part of a week of Holocaust memorial observances.
Janet Robb, Yanyu Guo, Gregory Hopkins and Richard Zeller were
scheduled soloists.

   Imelda Marcos' blood pressure soared Thursday,
forcing a recess of her trial, after she heard testimony about the
day she and her husband fled the Philippines with a ``tremendous
amount of jewels'' and cash.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan adjourned the trial until
Friday morning, provided the former Philippines first lady was able
to return. Her lawyer, Gerald Spence, said he expected her back in
court.
   ``I think it was the reliving of probably the saddest day of her
life,'' Spence said. ``It brings back vividly her memories of that
day.''
   Spence said Mrs. Marcos, 60, wanted the testimony to continue,
but her doctor would not permit it.
   Mrs. Marcos was sobbing during the testimony, and went to the
nurse's station in Manhattan's federal court when the lunch recess
was called. Her doctor examined her and found her blood pressure
was extremely high, and the nurse confirmed his findings, Spence
said.
   ``Her blood pressure is going up and down at this particular
time,'' Spence said. Mrs. Marcos rested in the nurse's office, then
left the courthouse on foot and with friends.
   ``She's very distressed about her memories,'' Spence told
reporters. ``She has been the pillar of strength for our side up to
this time.''
   The nurse, Marian Leonard, refused to answer questions about
Mrs. Marcos' physical symptoms, but said: ``She became very upset,
kind of emotional. She's under a lot of stress, as you know. ...
   ``She's improved. She just needs a little rest.''
   Another Marcos attorney, John Tigue, said later that Mrs. Marcos
returned to her Manhattan apartment and was ``resting
comfortably.'' He added, ``We expect her to be well enough to be in
court tomorrow.''
   Mrs. Marcos' husband died last September in Hawaii.
   The incident climaxed a morning of dramatic testimony and a
surprise visit to the courtroom by film actress Bo Derek,
accompanying members of the family of Saudi Arabian financier Adnan
Khashoggi, Mrs. Marcos' co-defendant.
   Mrs. Marcos became upset during the testimony of U.S. Customs
agent Leslie E. Kinney. He supervised the arrival of Mrs. Marcos
and her husband, Ferdinand E. Marcos, in Honolulu on Feb. 26, 1986,
the day after Marcos was ousted as president in a civil revolt.
   Kinney told of the official greeting party and red carpet that
awaited the Marcoses and their entourage of 90 people at Hickam Air
Force Base, Hawaii.
   He said some of the hundreds of suitcases and boxes that
accompanied the entourage contained a ``tremendous amount of jewels
and luxury items as well as money.''
   Kinney said one of the most striking things he found was a case
on which was embossed, ``Ferdinand Marcos, on our 24th wedding
anniversary.'' Inside, Kinney said, were 24 gold bars each weighing
about a kilogram. That would be worth about $286,000 at Thursday's
gold prices.
   Mrs. Marcos has been on trial since March 20. She has pleaded
innocent to charges of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and mail fraud for allegedly stealing $220
million from the Philippines treasury to buy New York real estate
and art.
   Her husband had been charged in the 1988 indictment.
   When Keenan excused jurors for the day, he told them not to
speculate on why the trial was recessed, saying the reason was
``nothing unusual.''
   As he does at the end of every day, the judge told jurors not to
read, watch or listen to any media reports about the case.
   Mrs. Marcos' lawyers earlier asked Keenan to caution the jury
against watching a mini-series, ``A Dangerous Life,'' which
dramatized the fall of the Marcos regime. The three-part series was
televised on a cable station this week.

<HEAD>Political Crisis on President Chamorro's First Day in Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
encountered a political crisis in her first full day in office
Thursday for allowing the Sandinistas to retain temporary control
of the army and security forces.
   Her decision to be her own defense minister but to allow Gen.
Humberto Ortega to stay on as army chief drew fire from rebel
leaders and split her coalition in the national legislature.
   Ortega is the brother of former Sandinista President Daniel
Ortega.
   Two ministers Mrs. Chamorro had named to her Cabinet refused to
serve as long as Gen. Ortega remained. Rebel leaders refused to
surrender their weapons to United Nations peacekeepers and talked
about taking to the hills and renewing their war against the
Sandinistas.
   A news conference scheduled for 11 a.m. by Mrs. Chamorro was
canceled without explanation and she remained out of sight for most
of the day.
   Journalists' telephone calls to the presidential office went
unanswered.
   Immediately after her inauguration Wednesday, Mrs. Chamorro
abolished the unpopular compulsory military service that forced
youths into the Sandinista army to fight a nine-year war against
the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras.
   She also announced plans to depoliticize the army and reduced it
in size. With an estimated 150,000 soldiers, it is the biggest in
Central America.
   Her transition team explained that her decision to retain
Humberto Ortega and other Sandinista security officials was a
temporary one.
   But this did not mollify her United National Opposition. The
coalition of 14 parties ranges from Communist to conservative. UNO
representatives in the National Legislature are split between those
willing to go along with Mrs. Chamorro, and those who demand
Ortega's removal.
   An agreement signed last week by Mrs. Chamorro's transition
team, the Contras and the Sandinistas called for the Contras to
voluntarily surrender their weapons to U.N. military peacekeepers
and disband by June 10.
   Up to her inauguration, Mrs. Chamorro remained vague about
allowing Sandinista officers to keep command of the army. The
Sandinistas warned all along of renewed war if she made any attempt
to alter the armed forces in any profound way.
   When word leaked that the Sandinistas would remain in control,
the Contras balked at disarming.
   Hours after Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration Wednesday, Israel
Galeano and Oscar Sovalbarro, commanding about 3,000 out of 5,000
Contra fighters in Safety Zone 1 in the northern village of El
Destino, refused to disarm. There are a total of 9,000 Contra
rebels inside Nicaragua.
   Like Zone 1, reports from the other four internationally
monitored enclaves showed that few if any Contras had actually
surrendered their weapons.
   Mrs. Chamorro's UNO coalition handily won elections on Feb. 25,
ending 11 years of Sandinista rule and confrontation with the
United States. Washington accused the Sandinistas of endangering
regional security with their close military ties to Cuba and the
Soviet Union and imposed an economic embargo.
   The 60-year-old Mrs. Chamorro is the widow of publisher Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, whose assassination helped ignite the 1979
revolution that brought the Sandinistas to power.
   Nicaragua's confrontation with the United States ended when Mrs.
Chamorro was sworn in for a six-year term. Vice President Dan
Quayle attended the inauguration and the Bush administration lifted
trade and other sanctions against Nicaragua and prepared to help
revive its battered economy
   But the Sandinistas, who got 41 percent of the vote, remained
Nicaragua's single biggest political party. This became evident
after the inauguration.
   Manuel Espinosa, information minister while Daniel Ortega was
president, called reporters Thursday to tip them that ``the defense
ministry just told me to say the Contras are reconcentrating in San
Rafael del Norte,'' a town near one of the security zones.
   No one knew for sure if he still had a government job.
   Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos was still Defense Ministry spokeswoman, but
when journalists called to check out the report she was not
immediately available, an aide said.
   A brawl _ after much drinking _ broke out at a ``popular
fiesta'' in Managua late Wednesday to celebrate Mrs. Chamorro's
inauguration and was put down by the Sandinista-controlled police.
   Three people were injured, and about a dozen revelers were
arrested.
   A man, who had four front teeth knocked out by police, said the
fray apparently started over an argument that the square where the
fiesta was held should be renamed Plaza of the Republic, and not
Plaza of the Revolution as the Sandinistas had it.

<HEAD>Technician Charged With Inserting Religion Into Porn Broadcast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television technician was charged with
federal criminal violations Thursday for allegedly interrupting the
satellite transmission of a pornographic television show with
religious messages.
   Thomas M. Haynie, a technician for the Christian Broadcast
Network in Virginia Beach, Va., was accused of using his employer's
satellite transmission equipment to break into transmissions of a
program called ``American Ecstasy'' on the Playboy cable television
channel, the Justice Department said.
   A department news release described the interrupted cable
broadcast as ``a hard-core pornography show.''
   The program was interrupted three times on Sept. 6, 1987, with
the video message: ``Thus sayeth the Lord thy God. Remember the
sabbath and keep it holy. Repent, the kingdom of God is at hand!''
according to the indictment.
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Norfolk,
Va., charged Haynie with intentional interference with two
communications satellites, including one used by the Playboy
Channel to transmit the program to its cable outlets.
   The charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and
a fine of up to $250,000.
   According to the indictment, Haynie was in charge of maintaining
the earth station at Christian Broadcast Network and knew how to
send signals to communications satellites.
   The case was investigated by prosecutors in the criminal
division of the Justice Department, officials said.

   President Bush won applause from conservative
leaders Thursday by voicing support for an array of causes ranging
from a cut in capital gains taxes to a constitutional amendment
allowing prayer in public schools.
   Bush previously has endorsed all of the proposals he cited
before the conservatives, but the leaders were still appreciative,
anyway.
   Bush spoke before nearly 200 people in the Old Executive Office
Building in the latest in a series of meetings with conservative
leaders, whom Bush credited with helping him win the presidency.
   Bush said the past two decades have demonstrated the
conservatism is ``a philosophy to which most Americans subscribe.
And I think that's still very true across the country.''
   He joked that ``some reporters say I don't have a vision. Sorry,
I don't see it.'' More seriously, he said his vision revolves
around an America that is prosperous and at peace.
   Calling for a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, Bush said
a cut would spur business investment and create new jobs.
   Along with his call for a constitutional amendment on school
prayer, Bush also urged that presidents be given a power known as
line-item veto, permitting them to delete individual items in large
appropriation bills.
   He won loud applause by saying that in any federal program for
child care, ``I will not see the option of relgious-based child
care restricted or eliminated. We're going to fight against that.''
   He made only a passing reference to Lithuania, which is
struggling against Soviet pressure to break away from Moscow's
control.
   ``In Lithuania _ as in Czechoslovakia and Nicaragua, Budapest,
Berlin _ the words of Thomas Dewey ring true _ you can't beat down
ideas with a club. Today, freedom is on the march and will not be
denied.''

<HEAD>Administration: Ban on `Saturday Night Specials' Would Harm
Citizens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill extending the ban on imported
``Saturday night specials'' to domestic arms manufacturers would
deprive some Americans of the ability to defend themselves with
handguns, the Bush administration said Thursday.
   Gun control opponents paint the attempt to outlaw small, cheaply
made handguns as a class and racial issue because poor people,
especially blacks, are more often the victims of crime and
inadequate police protection.
   Assistant Attorney General S.G. Dennis Jr. told the House
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime Thursday that a total
ban on the handguns commonly known as ``Saturday night specials''
would ``deprive citizens who do not already own a handgun of their
ability to obtain one suitable for self-defense but not for
sporting purposes.''
   But the committee's chairman, William J. Hughes, D-N.J., and
other Democrats said it was hypocritical to ban imports and not
domestic versions of the weapons.
   ``I regret that you have to come up here and advance that
argument,'' Hughes said.
   ``I just think if you can't take it in you ought not to be able
to sell it here,'' said Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky.
   But Dennis said the administration was called to testify on the
bill that is being proposed, not the law that has been on the books
since the late 1960s. The administration has no proposal to repeal
that law, he said.
   The proposed legislation, ``The Handgun Violence Prevention
Act,'' would ban the manufacture, assembly, acquisition and future
transfer of the Saturday night special-type pistols, said sponsor
Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla.
   The Gun Control Act of 1968 banned the import of guns that
lacked ``sporting purposes'' and required the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms to create a panel to screen
weapons using a point system.
   The administration used that standard last year to ban the
import of rapid-fire, multiround rifles that have been used by drug
dealers and in mass killings. The subcommittee has approved
legislation covering the U.S.-made versions of those so-called
assault rifles.
   Among those testifying was former White House Press Secretary
James Brady, who used the occasion to argue for another proposed
bill bearing his name. The Brady bill would require a waiting
period for anyone wanting to buy firearms to let authorities check
the record of the would-be purchaser.
   The bill is so-named because Brady, the former press secretary
to President Ronald Reagan, was seriously wounded and remains
disabled as a result of the assassination attempt on Reagan in
1981. The attacker, John Hinckley, was able to buy a .22-caliber
pistol easily despite a record of mental illness.
   Another James Brady _ James C. Brady _ allegedly used a
higher-caliber pistol made by the same company to gun down five
people at an Atlanta shopping mall on Tuesday.
   Brady had bought a pistol hours after being discharged from a
mental hospital, where he had been treated for homicidal and
suicidal tendencies.

<HEAD>Lithuanian President to Study French-German Proposal on Lithuania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said
Thursday he will carefully study a proposal from France and West
Germany that the Baltic republic temporarily suspend its
independence drive.
   The letter from French President Francois Mitterrand and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, delivered to Lithuanian
representatives in Moscow, said such a suspension could lead to
talks with the Kremlin ``so that the current crisis ends in a
solution acceptable to all parties.''
   Also Thursday, Vilnius Radio reported Lithuania will begin food
rationing May 1. The republic of 3.8 million people is struggling
under an economic embargo imposed last week by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to break its campaign for independence.
   Gorbachev himself was confronted Thursday by activists
protesting his crackdown in Lithuania. During his visit in an
industrial city in the Ural Mountains, demonstrators raised a
banner that called him a ``political hypocrite.''
   Landsbergis described the letter from Mitterrand and Kohl as ``a
step forward toward the realization of Lithuanian independence,''
said parliamentary spokesman Ed Tuskenis, speaking by telephone.
   Lithuania wants an immediate dialogue, Landsbergis said, and ``a
termination of the Soviet economic blockade against Lithuania would
be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue.''
   ``The leadership of Lithuania, greatly appreciating this act of
goodwill on the part of two noted leaders, will carefully study
this letter's proposition,'' he added.
   Tuskenis said Landsbergis viewed ``as positive'' that the letter
from Kohl and Mitterrand did not mention revoking Lithuania's March
11 declaration of independence. The letter discussed temporary
suspension of some decisions by the Lithuanian parliament.
   The letter from the French and German leaders came two days
after President Bush said he would put off sanctions against Moscow
for bringing economic and military pressure against Lithuania.
   Kremlin authorities on Monday urged Lithuania to suspend for two
years its declaration of independence.
   Lithuanian leaders have refused to revoke the declaration. But
the Baltic republic's leadership has always been willing ``to
discuss the timing and the form of independence, whether or not
that's a year or two,'' Tuskenis said after talking to Landsbergis.
   Lithuania has increased its efforts to circumvent the sanctions
imposed last week by Gorbachev.
   A Lithuanian delegation was due in Leningrad on Friday to talk
with officials about a direct exchange of goods either for hard
currency or barter, a Leningrad journalist said. Another group
arrived in Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, and met with local
lawmakers, according to the grassroots group Rukh.
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene announced Wednesday that
Lithuania had halted its usual shipments of meat, milk and other
food to the rest of the Soviet Union. She instead urged Lithuania
to settle its accounts with the republics ``almost in marketplace
conditions'' of bartering for other goods.
   The emergency committee of Lithuania's leadership considering
responses to Moscow's embargo has decided to start rationing some
food products beginning May 1, according to Vilnius Radio. No
details were released.
   Unlike most Soviet republics, Lithuania produces all the meat
and dairy goods it needs, so the rationing presumably would be of
those foodstuffs it does not produce, or of meat and milk products
earmarked for export.
   Gasoline already is being rationed in the republic since
Gorbachev cut off its oil and curtailed natural gas deliveries by
more than 80 percent last week. Individuals are limited to 7.8
gallons of gasoline per month. Sugar and soap detergent also is
being rationed, the radio said.
   Hospitals, running low on medicine, discouraged all but
emergency surgery, Radio Vilnius reported. In addition, newspapers
prepared to cut back the size of their editions by as much as half.
   Even if Lithuania were able to strike barter deals with other
Soviet republics, transporting the goods would be difficult,
because Moscow controls the train, truck routes and pipelines
throughout the nation.
   Lithuania may be getting some help from neighboring Estonia.
That republic's leadership is expected to order its railway workers
to ignore directives from Moscow to stop sending goods to
Lithuania, according to a spokesman for Estonia's Foreign Ministry.
   Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were forcibly annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940.
   Lithuania's top diplomat in the West said in Rome Thursday the
Baltic state was prepared to make ``all possible concessions'' to
Moscow except revoking its independence declaration.
   Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., who heads the Lithuanian diplomatic
mission to Washington and the Vatican, also distanced himself from
sharp criticism of the Bush administration by Landsbergis for not
instituting sanctions.
   Lozoraitis, speaking at a luncheon of The American Club of Rome,
called the United States a ``staunch friend'' of Lithuania and said
it was probably too late to influence Moscow through economic
pressure.
   ``It (Moscow) will not react to the sanctions,'' he said.

   Soviets joined wdespread protests, a 24-hour
telethon and a strike at a major factory Thursday to mark the
fourth anniversary of the world's worst nuclear accident, the
reactor explosion at Chernobyl.
   It was the Soviet Union's biggest national commemoration of the
1986 disaster, and it followed years of state-encouraged passivity
on the topic.
   This year, the Ukrainian legislature designated Thursday as
``Chernobyl Tragedy Day'' and its Byelorussian counterpart passed a
similar measure. Other government bodies in contaminated areas
sanctioned demonstrations.
   Official reports say 31 people were killed when one of four
reactors at the Chernobyl plant, in the Ukraine, caught fire and
exploded April 26, 1986. Unofficial reports say 250 died. The blast
spewed cesium, strontium and plutonium over a wide area of the
Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia and sent a cloud of radioactive gas
around the world.
   For the first two days after the accident, the Soviet Union
refused to report it to the outside world and withheld information
from its own people on the scope of the contamination.
   Residents in the southwestern Soviet regions most affected by
the partial meltdown organized demonstrations Thursday to demand
better medical treatment, protection from radiation and punishment
for officials who covered up the accident's effects, activists said.
   In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital 70 miles south of Chernobyl,
70,000 people gathered for Mass outside the 11th century Saint
Sophia Cathedral, reported Rukh Press International, a branch of
the Ukrainian people's front. In a subsequent protest, drivers
stopped traffic for five minutes and honked their car horns, the
report said.
   In the Byelorussian city of Gomel, most of the 35,000 employees
of the GomSelMash industrial complex staged a daylong strike, said
Alexander Korniev, a plant worker.
   Their demands included prompt closure of the Chernobyl plant and
criminal charges against all officials involved in the cover-up.
Three of Chernobyl's four reactors continue to operate.
   The Chernobyl Telethon, one of the Soviet Union's first
experiences with televised fund-raising, collected the equivalent
of about $115 million in rubles, as well $5 million in U.S.
dollars, organizers said.
   The live broadcast from Moscow interspersed singing groups and
interviews with gripping footage of Chernobyl rescuers and children
from the contaminated zone suffering radiation-caused cancers.
   Along with money, telethon pledges included donations of
radiation-free fruit and 1,100 pounds of honey for children in the
contaminated area.
   In the Byelorussian cities of Minsk and Gomel and throughout the
Ukraine, tens of thousands of residents gathered for church
services and mourning protests, Soviet TV reported.
   Vetka, north of Gomel, was among the small villages staging
demonstrations and strikes, according to local councilman Oleg
Gromyko.
   After dusk, Minsk residents lighted thousands of candles and
rang church bells, Tass reported.
   On the eve of the anniversary, the national parliament adopted a
$26 billion program that would involve resettling an additional
200,000 people from irradiated areas.
   After the accident, about 116,000 people were evacuated, and
some Soviet scientists and politicians have been campaigning for
further resettlements. They say 4 million Soviets live on
contaminated land.
   Many Chernobyl-area residents have complained of inadequate
medical care. Cases of anemia, leukemia and cancers have been
reported rising among people living on contaminated land. Many
residents still eat irradiated food because alternatives are not
available.
   Social and environmental fallout from the Chernobyl accident
continue in neighboring countries as well.
   In Sweden, which was in the path of the radioactive cloud,
authorities reported that fish from about 15 percent of its lakes
still are too contaminated to be eaten. It may take 30 years before
health authorities will clear the lakes.
   In Norway, newspapers reported that the level of cancer-causing
substances in the most affected regions is 10 times the normal
levels in plants and up to 20 times above normal in topsoil.
   In Czechoslovakia, Greenpeace environmentals scaled a cooling
tower at a nuclear power station. To cheers from onlookers they
hung a banner saying, ``Stop CSFRnobyl _ Greenpeace.'' CSFR is the
initials for the name of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic.
   A Czechoslovak hospital urged prosecution of its country's
Communist Party and government officials, whom it charged with
failing to take measures to protect citizens after the Chernobyl
accident.
   Official Soviet willingness to play up the Chernobyl anniversary
reflected the growing awareness of the catastrophe as well as the
reformist views of many new local governing councils.
   The television news program ``Vremya'' focused its afternoon
show on Chernobyl reports. ``We have been silent too long,'' a
Vremya reporter said.
   The Soviet legislature's new program was adopted Wednesday even
though many members criticized it as inadequate to deal with the
health, agricultural, economic and environmental aftermath of the
accident.
   The $26 billion earmarked Wednesday is twice the level spent in
the four years since the accident but still far short of the $405
billion Ukrainian legislator Yuri Scherback has estimated is needed
over the next 10 years.

   The Senate Budget Committee on Thursday
refused to endorse a $36.5 billion Social Security tax cut for next
year. The non-binding vote was Congress' first formal show of
sentiment on the politically sensitive proposal.
   By 17-6, the panel rejected the offering by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C. It was based on an almost identical measure
advanced last December by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., as
a way of forcing action on the federal deficit.
   ``This nonsense has got to stop,'' Hollings said before the
vote. ``We are wrecking ourselves. We are wrecking our country.''
   Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said he
supported the idea of reducing the tax rate but feared the
consequences it would have on the budget deficit.
   ``We've got to have a way to replace that revenue loss,'' he
said.
   Nine Democrats and eight Republicans voted against the tax cut
plan, while four Democrats and two Republicans supported it.
   Earlier Thursday, the committee rejected four 1991
deficit-reduction plans after the panel's majority Democrats failed
to unite behind a single package.
   The votes on the deficit plans left the committee floundering in
its search for a way to slash at least $37 billion from next year's
budget shortfall, which the Gramm-Rudman law requires. The panel's
work is expected to continue into next week.
   Across the Capitol, the House continued debating a $1.24
trillion budget for next year that provides less for defense and
more for domestic programs than President Bush prefers. Final House
approval of the Democratic-written plan is expected Tuesday.
   The House rejected two Republican-sponsored alternatives. A
proposal by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio., to freeze military and
domestic spending at current levels lost 305-106. A plan by Rep.
William Dannemeyer of California featuring the use of gold-backed
bonds to reduce the government's debt costs was defeated 354-48.
   The Social Security vote was only symbolic in nature. Congress'
budget committees set targets for revenue collection, but other
committees decide which taxes will be raised and by how much.
   But the issue has been sensitive. The White House has accused
supporters of the tax cut of ultimately wanting to reduce Social
Security benefits.
   Some Democrats have supported the proposal because of the
attractiveness of offering a tax cut, but others have opposed the
plan, arguing that it would simply make the deficit even larger.
   The provision would have lowered the 6.2 percent payroll tax to
5.1 percent next Jan. 1. The tax is paid by both wage earners and
employers. A family with a median income of $32,000 would save $400
a year.
   Over five years the reduction would have lowered payroll taxes
by $267 billion.
   Moynihan and Hollings have complained that the Social Security
trust fund is building up huge surpluses each year that make the
government's overall deficit appear smaller. Cutting the Social
Security tax, and thus reducing that surplus, would force lawmakers
to address the shortfall problem, the two Senators say.
   In defeating the four deficit-reduction proposals, Republicans
on the Senate panel did what they have been promising to do for
weeks. They have said any budget written solely by Congress will be
meaningless because Bush will veto elements he opposes, such as
deep defense cuts and tax increases.
   ``It can't be carried out, it can't be implemented,'' the
committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
said during a break. ``You just have to have both houses of
Congress and the president involved to get anything meaningful.''
   The committee's 13 Democrats divided their votes about evenly.
As a result, the panel rejected four Democratic plans that called
for savings ranging from $50 billion to $56.5 billion.
   All the Democratic plans relied more on defense cuts and tax
collections than Bush wants. They also surpassed the $37 billion in
deficit reduction the president proposed in January.
   But each one of them was turned down as Democrats skeptical that
the savings could be enacted into law joined the bloc of
Republicans.
   The only proposal that came close to approval was offered by
Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., which lost on an 11-11 tie. Measures
must receive a majority of votes to be approved.
   Wirth proposed imposing a $5 per barrel oil import fee, and
spending the $6.4 billion raised for environment, education and
deficit-cutting efforts.

<TEXT>
   Argentina's Congress voted
Thursday to claim the Falkland Islands, eight years after losing a
war with Britain over the remote South Atlantic archipelago.
Britain immediately objected to the measure, which appeared to be
largely symbolic.
   The legislation, approved despite opposition by Argentina's
foreign ministry, declares the Falklands _ known in Argentina as
the Malvinas _ to be part of the new Argentine province of Tierra
del Fuego. It also covers the Sandwich and South Georgia islands,
also British possessions.
   In London, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said: ``We don't accept this or any
other Argentinian claim to British territory.''
   The Senate has already approved the legislation, and President
Carlos Menem was expected to sign it.
   Menem said the measure ``does not signify that England recognize
our sovereignty, but rather, simply, that we ratified the Malvinas
are ours.''
   He added he did not expect the move to ``cause obstacles'' in
relations with Britain.
   Britain has held the Falklands since 1833. In 1982, Britain and
Argentina fought a 74-day war over the windswept islands, causing
the deaths of nearly 1,000 men.
   Argentina's ruling Peronist party had pushed for the inclusion
of the Falklands in the legislation creating the new province.
However, critics warned that the measure could backfire.
   They said the move could hamper Argentina's continuing claims of
sovereignty by giving credence to British arguments that Argentina
might try to impose its will on the 1,900 islanders.
   The islanders are British subjects and say they prefer to remain
so.
   For seven years after the war, Argentina refused to formally
declare a cessation of hostilities. Diplomatic ties were severed
and relations handled through third countries. Commerce, trade,
travel and investment declined.
   Improving ties was one of Menem's top foreign policy goals after
he became president last July. Consulates were upgraded to
embassies, direct air travel resumed, and a military exclusion zone
around the islands lifted.
   Britain and Argentina restored full diplomatic relations Feb.
16, following two days of talks between the two countries in Madrid.
   Britain agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone
enforced around the islands since Argentina invaded them in June
1982.
   The agreement said new arrangements to ensure the security of
the islands would involve advance notice by both sides of military
maneuvers in the area.
   By mutual assent, their agreement did not touch on the two
countries' conflicting claims to the Falklands.
   The British Foreign Office spokesman in London said: ``The
recent progress made on British-Argentine relations was only
possible on the understanding that we were not willing to discuss
sovereignty. And we will be repeating our views via diplomatic
channels.''
   The new province was created in response to demands by Argentine
residents of the island of Tierra del Fuego for greater government
representation. It had been Argentina's lone territory.
   Chile shares ownership of the island at the foot of South
America. The dividing line between Chile and Argentina was extended
years ago through Tierra del Fuego.
   Under the measure, residents of the new province would elect a
governor, who is now appointed by the president. Representation in
the national Chamber of Deputies would double to four, and two
Senate seats were to be alloted.
   The provincial capital is to be Ushuaia, 2,260 miles south of
Buenos Aires and the southernmost city in the world.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Thursday
called for slashing Pentagon plans for the B-2 stealth bomber and
other sophisticated aircraft, citing a diminishing Soviet threat.
   Cheney, pressed by congressional Democrats to cut military
spending in response to rapid changes in Europe, testified his
blueprint would trim $2.4 billion from President Bush's $307
billion defense budget for 1991 and would save $34.8 billion
through 1997.
   In addition to cutting the proposed number of B-2 bombers from
132 to 75, Cheney said he intends to cut planned purchases of the
C-17 long-range transport plane and the Navy's A-12 attack
aircraft, and to delay purchases of the Air Force's Advanced
Tactical Aircraft and the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., commended Cheney for ``coming to grips with some
things he clearly needs to come to grips with'' but said he didn't
go far enough.
   Citing analysts' testimony one day earlier on the internal
problems in the Soviet military as well as U.S. intelligence
reports predicting instability of the broader Soviet economy, Aspin
said Cheney's plan ``is based on an unrealistically pessimistic
view of the Soviet threat.''
   Cheney later presented his plan to the Senate Armed Services
Committee, where the panel's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., gave
the secretary high marks for his efforts but declined to adopt the
program totals.
   Nunn was puzzled, however, by Cheney's ability to reduce
aircraft programs without final figures on the armed forces.
   ``How can you make the decision on the numbers without having a
firm force structure in mind?'' Nunn asked.
   Cheney said the present situation dictates cuts in the B-2 and
C-17, and possible reductions in aircraft carriers and Air Force
wings will decide the other programs.
   ``I can tell you with some conviction that both the Navy and the
Air Force are going to be a lot smaller in the future than they are
today,'' Cheney said.
   The Democratic-controlled House is already debating a fiscal
1991 budget that would make significant cuts in proposed Pentagon
spending. The Senate is working on its own version.
   Cheney told the House committee, ``Soviet military capability
will continue to be robust but we can in fact afford to slow down
the pace of developing and fielding the next generation of aircraft.
   He said NATO faces ``fewer enemy aircraft and a reduced ground
threat'' as a result of the dramatic changes sweeping Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The defense secretary said that although the Soviet Union has
consistently found a way to upgrade its military despite economic
woes, ``we expect the overall performance of their economy to have
an impact on what they're able to build and deploy by the way of
sophisticated new weapons systems.''
   He predicted a slip in the years in which the new systems will
be deployed.
   Cheney said his proposed cutback would lower the projected cost
of the B-2 program from $75.4 billion to $61.1 billion. But he said
building fewer planes would drive up the cost of a single plane
from about $530 million to more than $800 million.
   ``We are in fact looking at targeting requirements,'' Cheney
said, noting the obvious change in what would be deemed targets in
Eastern Europe since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.
   Cheney said he intends to cut the number of B-2 aircraft to be
purchased in the next fiscal year to two planes, from the five
currently proposed at a cost in the fiscal 1991 budget of $5.5
billion. And the maximum number of planes to be built during peak
years of production would be reduced to 12 instead of 24, Cheney
indicated.
   Conservatives on the House panel suggested that Cheney's plan
for the B-2 will help the program survive on Capitol Hill.
   ``It could make it more palatable to members on defense,'' Rep.
Ike Skelton, D-Mo., said following the hearing.
   Rep. Robert Davis, R-Mich., said Cheney has given Republicans
``a very dependable position, something we can sell to the House
and the American people.''
   But Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., said lawmakers still will alk
at the ``imponderable, tremendous amounts of money either for the
overall program or the unit cost.''
   In other specifics, Cheney proposed:
   _ Buying 120 of the C-17 long-range transport planes instead of
the 210 originally planned at a proposed savings of $11.9 billion
over the life of the program. The plane is designed to replace the
aging C-141 transport plane.
   _Purchasing a smaller number of the Navy's A-12 all-weather
medium attack planes, cutting the original request of 858 to
minimum of 620. The A-12 is designed to replace the Navy's A-6E
Intruder, which is now reaching the end of its service life as an
aircraft-carrier based long-range strike jet.
   The cuts could mean elimination of two of the Navy's 14 aircraft
carrier battle groups, he said.
   Cheney said the total cost of the A-12 program is $52 billion
and the Pentagon has spent $5.1 billion on the aircraft. The total
cost amounts to about $84 million per plane.
   _ The Air Force's version of the plane, the Advanced Tactical
Aircraft, is supposed to be used for deep attack missions now
handled by the F-111 and F-15. Production of the ATA would be
delayed beyond 1997, the end of the Pentagon's long-term five-year
budget cycle, Cheney said.
   Cheney also suggested that purchases of the Advanced Tactical
Fighter be delayed from 1994 to 1996. The aircraft is intended to
replace the Air Force's F-15. The number to be purchased should
remain at 750, Cheney said.
   The delay in that fighter will also delay the procurement of the
Navy's version by two years, and reduce the number of aircraft to
546 from the original 618 planned, Cheney said.

<TEXT>
   The relentless lava flow from Kilauea
Volcano destroyed three Hawaii Island homes Thursday, bringing to
101 the number of dwellings lost during the seven-year eruption.
   The homes caught fire over a three-hour period as the molten
rock advanced through Kalapana Gardens subdivision, said Civil
Defense spokesman Bruce Butts.
   At 8:50 a.m. HST, the lava was menacing another home 80 feet
from the last to go up in flames.
   Kilauea has wiped out 25 Kalapana-area homes this month.
   Lava halted overnight and built up mass, then began advancing
rapidly at 4 a.m., Butts said.
   The flow was a quarter mile from Kalapana town, which has the
area's only store and a historic painted church.
   The coastal community may soon be history, said Hawaii County
Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim, who has stopped referring to
the ``evacuation'' of residents. Kim doesn't believe people forced
from their homes will be able to return and now says they have
``relocated.''
   ``Most of them are not going back. Ever.'' he said.
   The lava-ravaged area is in the midst of a ``massive disaster''
and should qualify for federal and state aid, he said.
   Hawaii County Mayor Larry Tanimoto met with Gov. John Waihee on
Wednesday to make a formal appeal for disaster aid.
   In a letter to Waihee, Tanimoto said: ``If an overnight tragedy
claimed as many homes and had displaced as many residents, we would
anticipate an enthusiastic, generous and immediate response to the
needs of those involved.''

<HEAD>Romanian Presidential Candidate Urges No Western Aid Before
Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA PIRVULESCU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major presidential candidate on
Thursday urged the West to withold aid to Romania until all
vestiges of communist rule are removed, as anti-government protests
went on here for a fifth straight day.
   Ion Ratiu, considered interim President Ion Iliescu's chief
rival in the the May 20 election, said he opposed a recent European
Economic Community decision to allocate immediate aid to Romania
because he feared it might strengthen the position of Iliescu's
National Salvation Front.
   The Front dominates the interim government running Romania until
the elections, and Ratiu said it seized power ``illegitimately.''
He told reporters he was against ``any gestures at this moment .. .
that could reinforce the power of the Front in any way.''
   Demonstrators, numbering 2,000-3,000 during daytime but down to
a few hundred in early morning hours, have lashed out at what they
say is communist infiltration of the interim government.
   Protesters at the anti-government rally at University Square
accused Iliescu of being a ``closet communist,'' despite his
repeated promises to break with the country's communist past.
   Iliescu was a senior Communist official until he fell afoul of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was executed during a revolution in
December.
   Many Western countries, including the United States, have
already sent limited aid to Romania, including food and medicine.
Ratiu apparently was referring to pooled economic assistance from
the 12 EEC countries, but he did not elaborate and EEC officials
were not immediately available for comment.
   Ratiu, 72, candidate of the 600,000-member National Peasant
Party, accused Iliescu and his Front of being unrepentant
communists guilty of manipulating the media in the electoral
campaign.
   Ratiu also said his life was threatened by a mob organized by
the Front in Buzau, about 200 miles northeast of Bucharest.
   The state Rompres news agency reported on Thursday the official
formation of a new intelligence service to replace Securitate, the
old state police agency which Ceausescu used to terrorize his foes
and ordinary Romanians.
   The new service will gather data solely on espionage services or
terrorists planning subversive actions to undermine Romania's
national economy, Rompres said.

<HEAD>Link Between Disease, Diet Supplement Maker Now Found in Four
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers in four states have now linked a
single manufacturer of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan to a
potentially deadly blood disorder which has struck 1,500 people.
   Federal epidemiologists from South Carolina and New York
reported Thursday that many of their states' cases of
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, a painful blood disorder linked late
last year to L-tryptophan, occurred after patients took the product
from just one Japanese manufacturer.
   Researchers from Oregon and Minnesota reported similar findings
Wednesday at a national epidemiology conference at the Centers for
Disease Control.
   ``The L-tryptophan use that's causing people to get ill is
virtually universally from one particular company,'' said Dr. Ed
Kilbourne, a CDC specialist in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or
EMS. ``Significantly fewer users were unaffected if they were using
that company's products.''
   L-tryptophan has been widely taken in this country by dieters,
insomniacs and people fighting depression. Before its recall by the
Food and Drug Administration earlier this year, it was widely sold
in health food stores.
   Several Japanese manufacturers make L-tryptophan and their
products are sold under a host of different brand names. The CDC
has refused to specify the company whose product has been
implicated because ``there are still a number of ongoing
investigations which are not yet complete,'' Kilbourne said.
   But The Washington Post on Thursday quoted a spokesman for the
Showa Denko Co., one of Japan's largest chemical manufacturers, as
saying the studies ``showed a strong statistical association
between our product and EMS.''
   Showa Denko has already been named in at least one lawsuit from
an EMS patient, a $20 million claim from a Oregon woman.
   ``But it is important to note that the studies do not
independently identify the precise cause of EMS,'' said the Showa
Denko spokesman, Bob Schwadron.
   The fact that one specific manufacturer has been implicated
means the likely cause of the illness is some sort of product
contamination _ and not simply L-tryptophan itself, Kilbourne said.
But researchers still don't know what sort of contaminant might be
responsible in that manufacturer's product, or how it got there.
   ``This is still a very complicated investigation,'' Kilbourne
said.
   Nationwide, nearly 1,500 cases of EMS have been reported to the
Atlanta-based CDC. Twenty-one patients have died.
   A Minnesota telephone survey reported Wednesday found that 3
percent of households contacted had someone taking L-tryptophan
between August and November 1989.
   South Carolina researchers found a number of EMS cases in one
psychiatric clinic that prescribed L-tryptophan for more than
three-quarters of its 654 patients in 1989. Forty-seven confirmed
EMS cases were found, and 45 were in patients taking one particular
brand from the implicated Japanese manufacturer, said Mary Kamb, a
federal epidemiologist in South Carolina.
   In New York, which has reported 145 EMS cases, the majority of a
study group of cases were linked to the same manufacturer, said
epidemiologist Ephraim Back, and most patients took the product
between December 1988 and May 1989.
   ``The epidemic rise of EMS supports the role of a contaminant as
the source of this disease,'' he said.
   EMS is marked by severe muscle and joint pain, breathing
difficulties, swelling of the arms and legs, skin rash, fatigue,
cough and sometimes fever. In some cases, victims show signs of
congestive heart failure and develop a condition that causes
progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis.

<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist rejected a
final appeal Thursday to delay start-up of the Seabrook, N.H.,
nuclear power plant in a decision that clears the way for the
reactor to begin routine operations.
   Rehnquist, without comment, rejected a bid by opponents of the
plant to hold up operation until a lower-level federal appeal can
be heard next September.
   ``We and the other (opponents) continue to have very serious
concerns about the operation of that plant and that's why we could
not in good conscience go ahead without exhausting every legal
remedy available,'' said Mary Breslauer, a spokesman for
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, who is leading the
anti-Seabrook forces.
   Shannon, along with the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League and the
New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution, will present the case
against Seabrook to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia on Sept. 18. The chief argument against the
plant all along has been that its location could trap thousands of
coastal residents and tourists in a nuclear emergency.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher said the Seabrook reactor is currently
being operated at 8 percent power and the power plant is on the
verge of producing its first commercial electricity, more than two
decades after it was first conceived.
   ``That will be the most significant milestone in Seabrook
station's history,'' Sher said. ``That will mark the first time
that Seabrook's electricity will be traveling through the power
lines of New England to homes and businesses and industries.''
   Now that Seabrook opponents have exhausted their last bid to
delay the plant, Sher said plant officials hoped ``Massachusetts
would stop its opposition and work with us constructively to
continue to update the emergency response plans for the communities
near Seabrook.''

<HEAD>State Says Nevada Cricket Infestation Under Control as Feds Attack
Insects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The worst Mormon cricket infestation in Nevada
since the 1930s appears under control, a state agricultural
official said Thursday as the federal government launched a second
aerial attack on the voracious insects.
   The infestation covers some 700,000 acres in five counties of
north-central Nevada with crickets counted at up to 100 per square
foot in some areas near Winnemucca, 160 miles northeast of Reno.
   ``I think we've made real progress in killing the insects,
although there's a lot of them out there,'' said Dick Rowe,
coordinator of the Nevada Department of Agriculture's Plant
Industry program. ``At the present time I think we've got things
under control.
   ``I might change my mind 30 days down the road, but for now it
looks like we're doing OK and the insects haven't done any real
damage yet.''
   Rowe said the crickets, which are related to grasshoppers, are
about three quarters of an inch long now but will grow up to two
inches long within the next month _ the size of a small mouse.
   If the juice-spitting insects aren't killed at the mouths of
canyons where they hatched, they'll merge together in a hungry
march across rural Nevada at a rate of one-half mile to one mile a
day, eating everything organic in sight such as crops, gardens and
grasses.
   Migrating bands can be one-half to one mile across and one to 10
miles long and usually aren't stopped except by cold weather or
poison. The barbed-legged insects have few natural predators,
authorities said.
   The insects, which can bite humans if disturbed, got their name
from a similar infestation reported in Utah in the 1800s. Sea gulls
from Salt Lake City reportedly flew over the infested land, eating
the crickets to save the area from total destruction, according to
Mormon legend.
   During the past few weeks, state agriculture officials on the
ground have been spreading bran bait laced with the pesticide
carbaryl-a to kill the crickets in the canyons.
   On Wednesday, the federal government began aerial spraying of
the pesticide in the Battle Mountain area where there aren't any
nearby waterways that could get contaminated.
   Silvia Holman, a spokeswoman for the Plant Protection and
Quarantine division of the U.S. Agriculture Department, said more
than 5,000 acres were sprayed Wednesday. Officials planned to spray
an additional 6,000 acres in the area during Thursday's second
flight.
   ``The crickets are really coming out of the woodwork,'' she
said. ``But we're fighting them every day.''
   Ranchers such as Eldon Crawford of Golconda have their own crews
killing crickets.
   ``I've had them for the past three years, but this is the
worst,'' Crawford said this week. ``I don't know how strong they're
going to get. My gut feeling is that we're going to stop them ...
But it's anybody guess.''
   Several dry winters in a row and a lack of predators created
perfect conditions for the record infestation, experts said.

<HEAD>Former California Senator Gets 6{ Years In Prison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former state senator convicted of
accepting payment to push a bill through the Legislature was
sentenced to 6{ years in prison Thursday.
   In sentencing state Sen. Joseph Montoya, U.S. District Judge
Milton Schwartz called Montoya's vote-selling ``the most serious
type of white-collar crime.''
   ``It attacks every single person and it attacks the process of
being able to continue a representative form of government,''
Schwartz said.
   Montoya, chairman of the Senate Business and Professions
Committee, was the first California legislator in 35 years to be
convicted of a felony while in office. He was the first person to
stand trial on charges stemming from an FBI sting of statehouse
corruption.
   He resigned from the Senate on Feb. 9, a week after he was
convicted of one count of racketeering, one count of money
laundering and five counts of extortion.
   The case stemmed from a lengthy FBI investigation. He was
convicted of demanding campaign contributions and honorariums in
exchange for votes and other legislative favors.
   Montoya, who turns 51 on Monday, showed no emotion during the
hearing. But two of his daughters, who sat behind their father, had
tears in their eyes.
   ``I believe in this system,'' Montoya told Schwartz. ``The
system found me guilty ... I will live with those consequences and
so will my family.''
   Schwartz also ordered Montoya to spend three years' probation
after serving his sentence, fined him $32,000, and ordered him to
pay $8,000 in restitution to cover money he collected in connection
with the case.
   The judge ordered the former lawmaker to surrender by June 29 to
begin serving his sentence. Defense attorneys said they would file
a motion to allow Montoya to remain free pending an appeal.
   The prosecution's case focused on a videotape of a breakfast
meeting the lawmaker had in 1988 with an FBI undercover agent who
posed as a southern businessman seeking legislation to help a dummy
company.
   During the meeting at a downtown Sacramento restaurant, the
undercover agent gave Montoya an envelope containing a $3,000 check.
   Prosecutors contended the check was a payoff requested by
Montoya for his help in getting a bill through the Senate.
   The defense denied that Montoya had done anything special for
the bill and argued that the money was a legal honorarium.

<TEXT>
   Scores of Puyallup Indians received $20,000
checks Thursday under the largest Indian land-claims settlement
outside Alaska, and a state official said tribal leaders feared the
cash would draw con artists.
   ``This money is the candy, the frosting, but hardly the most
important element'' of the settlement, said Michelle Aguilar,
executive director of the Washington State Office of Indian Affairs.
   Puyallup leaders refused to speak with reporters and barred them
from headquarters where checks were being distributed to more than
800 adults through Monday. Another 700 members are entitled to the
checks when they turn 21.
   ``There has been some concern that when you hand out this much
money to any large group of people _ Puyallup tribal members or
anybody else _ some people will be conned,'' Aguilar said.
   ``I know the tribe has done what it can,'' she said. ``It has
offered financial planning classes, but whether people availed
themselves of those classes was up to them.''
   The payments were made under a $162 million land-claims
settlement that took six years to negotiate. The tribe relinquished
its century-old claim to thousands of acres in the industrial heart
of Tacoma and other parts of Pierce County in exchange for cash,
programs and real estate from federal, state and local governments,
as well as private land owners.
   ``Everybody is focusing on the money, but that's the least of
this settlement,'' Ms. Aguilar said.
   ``The settlement will give the tribe and its members an
opportunity to participate in their own destiny'' through
development of valuable real estate and other financial avenues
provided by the settlement, she said.
   The settlement is second in size only to the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act of 1971, in which Congress gave $960 million
and 44 million acres to Eskimos, Aleuts and Alaska Indians in
exchange for their giving up land claims.
   Earlier, tribe officials told The Morning News Tribune of Tacoma
they were carefully guarding the membership list to try to keep con
artists at bay.
   Lena Landry, head of the tribe's trust fund board which is
overseeing the cash payments, said she and other leaders were
confident most recipients would spend the money wisely.
   The tribe took measures to spot problems, including forming an
alcohol crisis-intervention team and monitoring schoolchildren for
signs of family problems.
   Some Puyallups were less optimistic, recalling the alcoholism
and domestic abuse that plagued the Klamath tribe in Oregon after
members received cash payments more than 20 years ago.
   Ara Satiacum told the paper that drug dealers had come around
her home the last few days. She sold crack cocaine before
undergoing treatment earlier this year, and the dealers hoped to
front her a large quantity of crack to peddle in smaller amounts,
she said.
   Others have said they wouldn't bank the money for fear of taxes,
even though just the interest would be taxable.
   ``There's going to be a lot of people carrying their money
around because they don't want to put it in a bank account,'' said
Shirley Satiacum, Ara's mother. ``I'm worried people will be hit
over the head and robbed.''
   Tribe members told the paper some have already bought cars from
dealers who offered deferred payment plans.
   Tribe member Dennis LaPointe, a 36-year-old father of three,
made an offer on a small green house this week.
   LaPointe said most in the tribe were using their money to buy
necessities that have long been out of reach to many.
   ``We have a lot of hard-working Puyallup people who are just
waiting for a chance to show people what they can do,'' LaPointe
said.

   Ground controllers cheered after
re-establishing contact Thursday with the $1.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope through its main antennas.
   An attempt six hours earlier had failed.
   ``I'm pretty relieved, I must say,'' said Al Boggess, Hubble
project scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
   Applause erupted at Goddard's Space Telescope Operations Control
Center when the high-speed contact was made Thursday afternoon.
   Controllers sent information to the telescope about its
location, and ``this basically improved the telescope's knowledge
where it was, what its position was,'' said Goddard's Dave
Drachlis. They also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area
around the two high-speed dish antennas.
   ``We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with
the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna
system,'' Drachlis reported.
   The antennas are the primary communications links for relaying
scientific information to the ground.
   Controllers' lack of experience with the new satellite was part
of the problem, Boggess said.
   ``This probably won't be the last time we have a problem,'' he
said. ``We'll keep working at it until we have all these things
that need to be done, done. We'll get them right.''
   The problem began Thursday morning when engineers tried pointing
the two high-speed antennas toward two widely-separated TDRS
satellites without success. Two low-speed antennas were working
fine, but Boggess said they would be ``excruciatingly slow'' for
sending data.
   There had been a communications outage with the telescope
earlier. It lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error.
   In addition, one of four ``rate gyros,'' wheels whose spin
maintains the telescope in a stable position, was disconnected by
an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain
immediately. But it was restored later and the stability of the
satellite was unaffected.
   The problems won't delay the schedule for putting the telescope
into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``Now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what
part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do
differently in the future to make it continue to work,'' Boggess
said. ``Having done it once, we've got confidence we can do it and
that means the mission can proceed.''
   Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope
and was to stay nearby until the Hubble's aperture door was opened,
set for Friday morning. Its five astronauts spent the day doing
experiments and taking pictures of storms over Texas and other
views of Earth from 380 miles up, the highest a shuttle has ever
flown.
   When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened,
starlight will strike the telescope's finely polished 94.5-inch
mirror for the first time.
   If signals fail to activate the 10-foot-wide aluminum aperture
door, mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan
will go into open space and crank it open Saturday.
   The shuttle is scheduled to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif. The mission would be extended a day if the space walk
became necessary.
   On Tuesday, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
releases its first image from the telescope, an open star cluster
in the constellation Carina. Scientific data will follow in a month
or two.
   The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is
named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953. The
Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe
is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe
was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion.
   Astronomers expect to look back 14 billion years with the space
telescope.

   Criminal charges may slide off the ``Teflon
Don,'' but the sticky news media kept John Gotti from attending his
son's wedding, said the priest who conducted Saturday's ceremony.
   The Rev. Alfred F. Sepe said the reputed boss of the Gambino
crime family was absentbecause he feared his constant ``tails,''
the media hordes searching for signs of the service's location,
would have followed him and found the church, New York Newsday
reported Thursday.
   The son, John A. Gotti, married Kim Albanese at the Church of
the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Brooklyn.
   About 30 people attended the 22-minute service in the
137-year-old church.
   ``It was religious and done well,'' Sepe said.
   The elder Gotti _ attended by the media _ later made a grand
entrance at the reception through the grand foyer of the Helmsley
Palace, surrounded by friends, associates and the hotel security
staff.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the
right-wing Likud bloc, was chosen to form a new government Thursday
after Labor Party chief Shimon Peres gave up trying to forge what
he called a peace coalition.
   A Shamir-led government could spell trouble for U.S. efforts to
arrange a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
   At a Likud meeting Thursday, defector Avraham Sharir announced
his return to Shamir ranks, giving the prime minister the edge over
Labor, 61-59, with the support of non-Likud deputies in Israel's
120-seat Knesset, or parliament.
   Sharir earlier switched over to Labor when it seemed that Peres
had a chance to form a government.
   Peres predicted earlier that Shamir would also fail to form a
coalition, but added that if Shamir did succeed, he would create
``an extremist right-wing government the like of which Israel never
had.''
   On Thursday, Peres called President Chaim Herzog and announced
he was unable to break a standoff in parliament.
   Herzog's office said the president would give the job to Shamir,
head of the caretaker government that took over after parliament
voted March 15 to end the Labor-Likud coalition.
   Peres, as he left the president's residence Thursday evening,
said Shamir should count his 61 votes carefully, Israeli Radio said.
   Shamir, 74, will get the mandate in a ceremony Friday morning at
the president's residence. A spokesman said he would accept.
   The Polish-born Shamir, who lost his parents and two sisters in
the Nazi Holocaust, was a prestate radical underground leader who
later served as a senior official in Israel's Mossad intelligence
agency.
   Shamir has rejected any dealings with Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization and has forged ahead with settlement
building in Israeli-occupied lands, despite increasing signs of
strain with Washington.
   In recent weeks, for example, Shamir's government approved
settlements in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank. It was
also revealed that it secretly gave $1.8 million to a Jewish
settlement in the Christian quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.
   The new settlement activity sparked sharp protests from the U.S.
State Department, which considers settlements in the occupied
territories an obstacle to peace.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the United States was dismayed by reports of new settlements
at Dugit in the Gaza Strip and Alon in the West Bank.
   ``It is disturbing that the caretaker government is taking steps
that the National Unity government was unwilling to take on
settlements,'' Boucher said. ``It is our longstanding position that
settlement activity in the occupied territories is an obstacle to
the achievement of a just and lasting peace.''
   Peres spent 35 days trying to forge an improbable alliance of
ultra-Orthodox religious parties and small left-wing factions. He
abandoned the effort only hours before a midnight deadline.
   Peres, 66, triggered the crisis by demanding that Shamir accept
Secretary of State James A. Baker III's terms for convening
Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo. Shamir refused, and Peres won a
vote of no-confidence in parliament.
   Roni Milo, the communications minister, said Shamir would not
respond positively to Baker's peace proposals and opposed sharing
power with Labor.
   Peres, who has headed the Labor Party since 1977, is likely to
face a major challenge to his leadership, especially from the
supporters of Yitzhak Rabin, who served as prime minister from 1974
to 1977.
   At a party meeting Thursday night, Rabin said Labor should
consider entering a unity government with Likud if Shamir agreed to
electoral reform within six months.

   A powerful earthquake on Thursday killed more
than 100 people and damaged hundreds of homes in a remote region of
central China populated mainly by Tibetan herders, officials said.
   The quake Thursday evening measured 6.9 on the Richter scale,
striking Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai province,
about 900 miles southwest of Beijing, a State Seismology Bureau
said Friday.
   A bureau official, who did not give his name, said 109 people
were killed and 120 were hospitalized. More than 1,000 homes in the
sparsely populated, rugged area collapsed from the initial quake
and more than 500 aftershocks, he said.
   Aftershocks as strong as 5 on the Richter scale were felt in the
provincial capital of Xining, about 70 miles northeast of Hainan
Prefecture, and in Lanzhou, a city 180 miles the east.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said homes in Heka Township of
Xinghai County were damaged and a landslide occurred at the
Longyangxia Reservoir on the Yellow River. A hydroelectric power
station at the reservoir was not damaged, it said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by a quake,
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
measuring 6 can cause severe damage in a populated area, and one
measuring 7 is 10 times stronger and can cause widespread, heavy
damage.
   Qinghai is a mountainous region inhabited by miners and herders,
where quakes occur fairly frequently with few casualties. A quake
measuring 6.7 struck the region in January, damaging some buildings
but causing no casualties.
   The far western Chinese province of Xinjiang was hit by a quake
measuring 6.4 on April 19. About 1,300 homes were damaged but only
two people were injured.

   Conservative Prime Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis won a vote of confidence early Friday, gaining the
mandate he sought to take drastic measures to cure Greece's ailing
economy.
   Members of Mitsotakis' party cried out ``Axios!'' (worthy) and
lined up to congratulate him.
   ``We need to get to work now and put into effect the policy
which we have proposed,'' Mitsotakis told reporters.
   Besides economic reforms, he has promised to improve relations
with Greece's allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the European Community.
   Greece was often at odds with its Western allies during eight
years of Socialist rule under Andreas Papandreou.
   The confidence vote began at Thursday midnight and the
government won 152 votes in the 300-member Parliament, with 146
deputies voting against, one abstaining and one absent.
   ``The government enjoys the confidence of Parliament,''
announced Athanassios Tsaldaris, president of the chamber.
   Mitsotakis' New Democracy party won 150 seats in April 8
elections after failing to win a majority in elections last June
which removed the Socialists from office. Another inconclusive poll
was held in November.
   Coalition governments ruled from June to April.
   Mitsotakis formed a government after the Democratic Renewal
party pledged to support it in Parliament. He has said he intends
to govern for a full 4-year term.
   Mitsotakis has promised to renew negotiations with the United
States on an expired defense agreement and to recognize the state
of Israel.
   He has blamed Socialist policies for the economic troubles and
stressed that sacrifices will be required for a recovery.
   ``The government has the honor to present a policy that is
painful and unpleasant,'' he said. ``It saddens us, but we have to
carry it out because there is no other choice, and it can lead the
country to revival.''
   Mitsotakis announced increases in public utility rates, cuts in
government spending and widespread privatization.
   Papandreou predicted Mitsotakis' steps would ``cause the
immediate shriveling of people's wages.''
   The measures also drew fire from some of Greece's powerful trade
unions.
   The General Confederation of Greek Workers raised the
possibility of protest strikes.

<HEAD>California's `Big Green' Initiative Seen as Voter Puller</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODNEY ANGOVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental advocates announced
Thursday they had collected 800,000 signatures favoring the state's
``Big Green'' initiative, which would curtail pesticide use,
offshore drilling and timber cutting.
   The all-Democratic leadership of the ``Big Green'' environmental
initiative intended for the November ballot predicted that it would
bring out voters like never before.
   ``Earth Day gave us just a hint of how deeply Californians care
about our environment. On election day we'll deliver the whole
message. Nothing can stop us from passing Big Green,'' John Van de
Kamp, the state attorney general and a Democratic candidate for
governor, told a Capitol news conference.
   The news conference and ones in Los Angeles and San Francisco
were called to announce that 800,000 signatures had been collected
in favor of placing the initiative on the ballot. The measure needs
372,178 valid signatures; the signatures will be checked by the
secretary of state's office.
   If ``Big Green'' wins approval it would go on the books as the
Environmental Protection Act of 1990.
   The act proposes stringent controls on pesticide use,
preservation of ancient redwood stands, bans on clear cutting
timber, blocks on offshore drilling and the creation of an
environmental czar to oversee enforcement and implementation. It
would appropriate $20 million to seek alternatives to pesticides.
   Al Meyerhoff of the Natural Resources Defense Council called it
``the most sweeping measure ever put before the voters by
environmentalists anywhere in the country.'' He said it would serve
as a litmus test for political candidates, and ``send a message to
Congress.''
   Two opposing ballot issues are being readied to challenge some
of the provisions of Big Green.
   Under the aegis of Californians for Responsible Food Laws, or
CAREFUL, agribusiness interests are trying to get a less
restrictive pesticide measure on the ballot. And the timber
industry is backing a measure to cancel out the initiative's
provisions to save trees.
   Van de Kamp, whose staff wrote the measure with the help of
environmental groups, has touted it as evidence of his commitment
to environmental issues.
   Big Green also has the support of Van de Kamp's rival in the
June Democratic primary for governor, former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein, who endorsed it on Earth Day.
   The GOP candidate for governor, Pete Wilson, hasn't taken a
stand.
   In addition, Big Green is sponsored by environmental groups
including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council
and the National Toxic Campaign.
   The proponents said they expect to spend $1 million to $3
million campaigning.
   Van de Kamp, in explaining support for the measure, said, ``Some
800,000 Californians have signed up to ban cancer-causing
pesticides from our food, to protect our coast from oil drilling
and tanker spills, to stop the dumping of sewage and industrial
waste in the ocean, to save our virgin redwood forests and to lead
the fight against global warming.''

<HEAD>NATO May Scrap New Short-Range Missile Deployment Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With East-West tensions subsiding, the
NATO alliance may abandon a controversial plan to deploy a new
short-range missile in Europe, sources said Thursday.
   The alliance may also cut its stockpile of battlefield nuclear
artillery, the sources said.
   North Atlantic Treaty Organization officials will begin a series
of meetings next week that could result in dramatic policy changes
as they seek to shape the alliance from a military organization to
a more political one.
   An announcement of moves to end the nuclear missile project and
trim battlefield nuclear artillery could come at an expected
summit, possibly in the summer, of the leaders of the 16 NATO
nations, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The sources emphasized that no final decisions have been made.
However, a diplomat said ``it's a near certainty'' that NATO will
agree to the measures.
   ``All these things are being discussed right now,'' said another
diplomat. ``Short-range nuclear forces is very much a hot subject.''
   The moves are being considered in light of the pro-democracy
revolutions that have swept through Eastern Europe and the
resulting changes in military strategy.
   The alliance's defense ministers meet May 9-10 in Canada to take
a look at the West's future nuclear posture. Aides to the defense
ministers will gather Friday in Brussels to discuss nuclear issues
in advance of the Canada meeting.
   In recent months, NATO diplomats have said there was dwindling
support for an American plan to develop a new, more powerful
generation of short-range nuclear missiles. The new weapon would
replace the aging Lance surface-to-surface missile.
   One source said there was ``a possibility'' the defense
ministers at their Canada meeting would declare the project dead.
But another said it was unlikely. A third said he had not seen any
draft statements about the project.
   The Bush administration said last week that it was postponing
development of the weapon. It said the Army had put on hold plans
to issue a formal request for contractors' proposals to build the
new missile.
   The new Lance weapon is strongly opposed in West Germany, where
most of the missiles would be based.
   The Lance, introduced in 1972, has a range of about 75 miles.
Its replacement would be designed to hit a target more than 250
miles away.

   A study linking cancer in
rats to fluoride was inconclusive, a government scientific panel
said Thursday after reviewing research on the cavity-fighting
chemical.
   The review by scientists of the National Toxicology Program was
intended as a guide to government policy makers on the safety of
the chemical, which is consumed by 53 percent of Americans in their
drinking water and is a standard ingredient in toothpaste.
   The government study, released in February, was seized on by
opponents of fluoridation, who have waged an emotional,
decades-long battle against adding the chemical to the water supply
to prevent tooth decay. Many previous studies had found
fluoridation safe.
   The panel, the National Toxicology Program's Board of Scientific
Counselors voted after debate and public comment to label the new
evidence ``equivocal.''
   ``It is like a little flashing yellow light on the instrument
panel, saying you need to look at this more closely,'' said Dr.
David Rall, a government scientist. ``At this moment, I don't think
it implies any change in policy.''
   Rall is director of the National Institutes of Environmental
Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program, whose
scientists carried out the study.
   ``What we're trying to say is we really don't know,'' said panel
member Robert Garman.
   Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the
Department of Health and Human Services, issued a statement
Thursday saying no information existed that would call for a change
in Public Health Service policy supporting the use of fluorides for
the prevention of tooth decay.
   Mason said the panel's action was ``one step in a continuing
evaluation of health risks and health benefits of fluoridation
underway by the Public Health Service.''
   The findings will be incorporated into a broader review with
other animal and human studies involving fluoride ``to ensure that
every possible avenue of research has been re-examined in light of
the NTP findings,'' he said.
   The Public Health Service scientists reviewing the research are
expected to report their conclusions in July.
   The study released Thursday found bone cancer in five of 130
male rats given high doses of fluoride. No tumors were found in
female rats or either sex of mice.
   The panel's report said the study found a marginal increase of
tumors that may be related to the chemical.
   In the emotionally charged atmosphere surrounding the
fluoridation debate, panel members labored long just to reach that
seemingly mild conclusion. The panel labored for nearly an hour to
choose words that wouldn't become weapons for either side in the
fluoride fight.
   Before arriving at the final version of its report, the panel
voted down a motion to say there was absolutely no evidence of a
cancer link in the study.
   ``The more we do this, the more I recommend that we don't do
this,'' said Ellen Silbergeld, who said the panel might be
``lending ammunition inadvertenly or whatever to one side or
another.''
   Before the vote, Dr. John Stamm, dean of the School of Dentistry
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, argued that the
results were too weak even to be called ``equivocal.'' Stamm also
is a spokesman for the American Dental Association.
   ``The potential misunderstandings created could lead to
immediate turmoil in the U.S. public health arena,'' he said in
prepared comments.
   Dr. James Bawden, representing the American Association for
Dental Research and the American Association of Dental Schools,
said the study gives ``no indication that fluoridation of municipal
water supplies is unsafe.''
   On the other side, Dr. John Yiamouyiannis of the Safewater
Federation in Delaware, Ohio, said the study and others ``provide
clear evidence that fluoride is carcinogenic.'' The Safewater
Federation campaigns against fluoridating the water supply.
   An estimated 132 million Americans drink water that has fluoride
added to reach the level of one part per million, according to the
Academy of General Dentistry. An additional 10 million people drink
water from naturally fluoridated water supplies that have levels as
high as eight parts per million.
   The study found one rat in a group of 50 developed osteosarcoma
_ a form of bone cancer _ after drinking water with 45 parts per
million of fluoride over two years. Four rats in another group of
80 developed cancer _ three osteosarcomas _ after drinking fluoride
at 79 parts per million during the period.
   The scientists who conducted the study labeled as insignificant
the difference in cancer incidence between rats given fluoride and
those without.
   The study's author, J.R. Bucher, noted that in one earlier
study, three bone cancers occurred among a group of rats who
weren't exposed to excess fluoride.
   During the public comment period, Bob d'Amato of Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. said a recently completed study at his company found
just one case of osteosarcoma among 70 rats _ that in a female that
received little fluoride.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House chided Congress Thursday for
its resolution declaring Jerusalem to be Israel's capital, saying
the lawmakers need to give more serious consideration to unintended
consequences of such resolutions.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the comment when
asked about criticism of the resolution in the Arab world and
suggestions that it might hinder the possible release of additional
U.S. hostages.
   ``Our only comment would be that Congress needs to consider
these resolutions more seriously than they have in the past. And
that sometimes they can have unintended consequences,'' Fitzwater
said.
   On Wednesday, Hussein Musawi, the reputed spiritual mentor of
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, urged the terrorist
group not to release another hostage because of the resolution
passed by the House.
   Syria sharply condemned the resolution Thursday, saying it was
intended to emphasize the American desire to ``defy Arabs and
Moslems by stealing their rights without any lawful or historical
justification.''
   In Iran, a radical newspaper said the resolution would delay the
release of Western hostages in Lebanon. The Farsi-language Jomhuri
Islami, or Islamic Republic, said it ``made things more complicated
by blocking the way for solving problems.''
   The nonbiding resolution was approved by the House 378-34 on
Tuesday. It conflicts with official U.S. policy, which does not
recongize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and calls for negotiations
to determine the final status of the city.
   Israel declared Jerusalem its capital in 1967 after capturing
the city's east side from Jordan in the Six-Day war.
   Jerusalem contains sites considered sacred by Christians,
Moslems and Jews.
   The House resolution is identical to one passed March 22 by the
Senate. Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., has said that this
measure was a mistake and has damaged the Bush's administrations
efforts to foster Middle East peace negotiations.
   Rep. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., one of the supporters of the
resolution, brushed off Fitzwater's criticism Thursday, saying, ``I
think the White House has little standing to criticize Congress
since this entire resolution developed as a response to President
Bush's reckless comments about Jerusalem.''
   Berman referred to Bush's unexpected remark last month linking
East Jerusalem with the occupied territories of the West Bank and
Gaza by saying Israel should not settle Soviet Jews coming to
Israel in any of those three territories. Previous U.S.
administrations had always treated East Jerusalem separately,
arguing the status of the entire city should be settled in peace
negotiations.
   As for comments in Iranian newspapers, Berman said: ``For 10
years now Iranians have found one thing or another to justfiy
falling short of the fundamental standards of civilized nations.
This is just another excuse.''

   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez told
President Bush on Thursday that Latin America wants to take part
``in shaping a world of peace, of peaceful neighborliness and
respect of human rights.''
   Perez visited with Bush a day after the Venezuelan president
attended the inauguration in Managua of Violeta Chamorro as
president of Nicaragua.
   Bush said Chamorro's inauguration was ``a great day for
democracy'' and ``a time to celebrate.''
   Bush gave the Venezuelan leader a warm welcome during an arrival
ceremony on the south lawn of the White House. Bush said Perez's
``deep personal commitment to the advance of democracy never
wavered.''
   He also said Perez's free-market economic policy ``has meant
some pain for the people of Venezuela, but ... is the kind of new
beginning that will lay the foundations for future growth.''
   Perez, responding, said, ``The Latin American continent is
determined to modernize its structures, institutions and relations,
even in spite of the fact that our efforts do not always meet with
proper understanding, cooperation and encouragement.''
   Perez imposed an austerity program after riots erupted about
three months after he took office at the end of 1988.
   Bush, toasting Perez at a state dinner Thursday night, promised
he would visit Venezuela later this year during a trip to several
South American states, probably in late September.
   Praising Perez as ``one of Latin America's great statesmen,''
Bush said ``our two nations share a vision of totally democratic
hemisphere and a common love of freedom. And we agree that no
system is better than democracy at securing the peace and
prosperity that all nations seek.''
   Perez hailed Bush as a good friend and said it was important
``to cooperate as much as possible'' and to strengthen ties.
   Meanwhile, informed sources who asked not to be identified said
Bush is expected to name career diplomat Michael Skol as ambassador
to Venezuela. Skol, 47, has spent the past several years as a
deputy assistant secretary of state for South American affairs.

   A man on a suicide mission pulled out a
submachine gun on a crowded Colombian jetliner Thursday and
assassinated a presidential candidate before being killed in a
blaze of pistol fire from bodyguards.
   A drug trafficking group called the Extraditables claimed
responsibility for shooting former leftist guerrilla chief Carlos
Pizarro and said his name was picked in a drawing, the radio
network Caracol said.
   The group, mainly from the Medellin cocaine cartel, said other
candidates will be killed until traffickers are pardoned.
   Pizarro, until last month commander of the notorious April 19
Movement, a rebel outfit known as the M-19. was the fourth
Colombian presidential candidate to be assassinated in the past 31
months. Drug traffickers were blamed in all four deaths.
   As an apparent precaution against any violent reaction to
Pizarro's assassination, Mayor Andres Pastrana ordered all public
and private schools closed Friday in Bogota, the capital. In a
communique, Pastrana also ordered a ban on alcohol sales for the
metropolitan area of 6 million people until further notice.
   An anonymous telephone caller said the names of three other
presidential candidates were in the death lottery and that another
candidate will die.
   Passengers screamed and ducked down in their seats as shooting
broke out eight minutes after the Avianca Airlines Boeing 727 left
Bogota's El Dorado international airport, the pilot, Capt. Fabio
Munevar, said.
   The plane, en route to the Caribbean coastal city of
Barranquilla, where Pizarro was to campaign, returned immediately
to Bogota.
   No one else on the plane was hurt.
   The killer, 25-year-old Alvaro Rodriguez, apparently retrieved
the submachine gun from an airplane bathroom, Munevar said.
   He told Caracol Rodriguez went to the restroom at the back of
the jet shortly after takeoff, then returned and took his seat two
seats behind Pizarro.
   Minutes later he stood up and whipped out the weapon from his
black leather jacket.
   Leaning over a passenger in the row in front of him, Rodriguez
pointed the gun at Pizarro's head, about a foot away, and opened
fire. Police said only Pizarro was hit.
   Eight bodyguards accompanied Pizarro on the flight, Caracol
quoted an unidentified campaign worker accompanying Pizarro as
saying.
   Two men with submachine guns were arrested at Barranquilla
airport, a police spokesman there told The Associated Press. They
apparently were part of an assassination squad with orders to kill
Pizarro if he survived the flight. Disturbances broke out in
Barranquilla to protest Pizarro's death, and three buses were
burned, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It was not immediately clear how the submachine gun was smuggled
onto the plane. Air passengers boarding at Bogota are frisked and
their belongings are searched. However, it is normal for
presidential bodyguards to carry weapons, even on passenger flights.
   Caracol said in an unconfirmed report that five bullets smashed
into the window near Pizarro, but none penetrated the thick,
laminated plastic.
   The plane carried 91 passengers and a crew of six, an Avianca
spokeswoman told the AP.
   The man calling Caracol said two gunmen were part of the plot to
kill Pizarro, but did not say if both were on the plane.
   Police mentioned only one gunman.
   The caller said the other three candidates in the drawing were
Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and Rodrigo Lloreda, both of the Conservative
Party, and Cesar Gaviria of the governing Liberal Party.
   ``The next drawing will be between Gaviria and Lloreda,'' he
said.
   The traffickers are no longer fighting extradition, the caller
said.
   Now, he said, presidential candidates will be killed until the
government gives traffickers pardons as if they were part of a
``political-military organization.''
   Months ago, the traffickers said they should get the same
treatment as leftist guerrillas who are pardoned. Last month the
government pardoned hundreds of guerrillas of Pizarro's M-19
movement.
   Pizarro died 45 minutes after arriving at a government hospital
about three miles from the airport, the hospital said in a
communique. The Bogota morgue said Pizarro was hit by 13 bullets.
   The son of a Colombian navy admiral, Pizarro spent most of his
adult life as a member of the the April 19 Movement, which took its
name from the date of a presidential election Pizarro and other
university students said was rigged. He commanded M-19 when it
disbanded last month as part of a peace agreement with the
government.
   M-19 then became a political party, and Pizarro was its
candidate for the May 27 presidential elections.
   The assassination of Sen. Carlos Louis Galan last August led to
the government's crackdown on Colombia's drug cartels.
   At the time of his death, Galan, of the Liberal Party, was the
leading presidential contender and had urged a hard line against
drug traffickers.
   Since the crackdown began, the government has extradited at
least 15 drug suspects to the United States to face charges. The
drug lords have waged a campaign of terror in an effort to halt the
feared extraditions.
   The government also blamed drug traffickers for the killings of
Jaime Pardo Leal, of the Communist Party, and Bernardo Jaramillo,
of the leftist Patriotic Union Party.
   Pardo was killed Oct. 11, 1987, in an ambush on a dirt road near
Bogota.
   Jaramillo was killed when a man walked up to him at Bogota's
airport and opened fire with a submachine gun hidden inside a
folded newspaper.
   The government said drug traffickers killed Pardo and Jaramillo
because of the traffickers' hatred for leftists. Traffickers own
vast amounts of land in Colombia, much of it cattle country where
leftist guerrillas have long extorted ranchers for money to support
their war against the government.
   Pizarro opposed extradition of traffickers to the United States.
His aides said that was because he believed Colombia should solve
its own problems.
   Since the crackdown began, drugrunners have killed more than 230
people, including judges, politicians, policemen, soldiers and
newspaper employees.
   The bloodiest act occurred Nov. 26, when a bomb exploded aboard
an Avianca jet shortly after it left Bogota. All 106 people aboard
were killed.

<HEAD>Senate Preserves $420 Million in Panama Aid</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS grafs 3-5: ``The Senate,'' to reflect Senate working
late; veto threat from President Bush. Should stand for AMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate late Thursday rejected an effort to
cut the aid President Bush is seeking for Panama and use it instead
for a variety of domestic programs.
   Senators left the $420 million Panama aid intact when, on a
51-48 vote, they defeated an amendment by Appropriations Committee
Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The Senate then labored late into the night as it tried to deal
with dozens of proposed amendments, but prospects appeared remote
for quick approval of the overall aid bill, which included $300
million for the government of new Nicaraguan President Violeta
Chamorro.
   ``Mrs. Chamorro's term may expire before we get the aid down
there'' cracked Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   The bill still faces a veto threat from President Bush, who
opposes a provision that would allow the District of Columbia
government to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women.
Such payments have been banned for the past two years.
   Byrd had proposed to slash Panama aid to $300 million and use
the largest chunk of the savings for cleaning up Department of
Energy nuclear plants. Other money would have gone for sanitation
in Indian housing, agricultural disasters and a nutrition program
for women and children.
   Capitalizing on the general unpopularity of foreign aid in
Congress, Byrd cast his amendment as an effort to make charity
begin at home.
   ``If we do not take a long, hard look at the way we parcel out
our scarce dollars, the day will come when the American people are
going to say `Enough!''' Byrd said. ``The support for foreign aid
programs is dwindling and it will continue if those programs are
not well justified and well crafted.''
   But Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., said the United States has an
obligation to Panama stemming from the U.S. economic embargo and
the damage inflicted by December's invasion, which ousted dictator
Manuel Noriega.
   ``We owe them,'' Hatfield said. ``This is a bill that's due.''
   Byrd's move came as the Senate began consideration of a $3.4
billion spending bill that included the Panama money as well as
$300 million for the new democratic government of Nicaragua and
funds for a laundry list of congressional add-ons.
   Among the additions were flood relief, food stamps and veterans'
benefits, as well as items included for individual lawmakers. Byrd,
for example, won inclusion of $185 million for an FBI fingerprint
lab planned for Clarksburg, W.Va.
   Supplemental spending bills are sent to Congress late in each
fiscal year to cover shortages in government programs that have
been underfunded or to meet unforeseen needs that have arisen
during the year.
   Bush asked Congress for $500 million for Panama, $300 million
for Nicaragua and $70 million for refugee programs. When the House
passed the bill April 3, it cut the amount for Panama to $420
million and added domestic spending items that pushed the measure's
overall cost to $2.4 billion. The Senate panel added still more,
pushing it to $3.4 billion.
   Most of the new spending in both versions of the bill is covered
by cuts in the Pentagon budget, including personnel, weapons
systems and research and development.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., a sponsor of Byrd's amendment,
said many purposes of the Panama aid, such as restoring tourism and
providing student scholarships, were not emergency needs and could
wait.
   ``Should this $120 million be used for non-priority needs in
Panama, or should it be used for emergency needs here in the United
States? It's that simple,'' he said.
   Referring to environmental problems at Energy Department
facilities such as Rocky Flats, Colo.; Savannah River, S.C.;
Fernald, Ohio; Hanford, Wash.; and Oak Ridge, Tenn., Johnston said,
``If there's an emergency in the United States, this is it.''

   The Coast Guard seized a Soviet trawler
Thursday for allegedly fishing in U.S. waters off Alaska and was
escorting the vessel to port, officials said.
   The Soviet factory trawler Ilya Ilyin was being escorted by the
Coast Guard cutter Yocona to Kodiak, about 250 miles southwest of
Anchorage, the Coast Guard said.
   Operators of the 3,147-ton vessel will be charged with violating
the Magnuson Act, a 1976 law that established the nation's 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Burgess
in Anchorage. The ship, expected to reach port by Sunday, will be
subject to possible forfeiture, he said.
   Coast Guard surveillance aircraft spotted the Soviet trawler
allegedly fishing inside U.S. waters northwest of the Pribilof
Islands in the Bering Sea, the Coast Guard said.
   The Yocona was dispatched to intercept the trawler, and Thursday
morning ordered the Soviet ship to halt, but the vessel attempted
to elude the cutter and return to international waters.
   ``The cutter pursued the vessel at high speed for the next hour
and a half, crossing into international waters before the vessel
stopped and was boarded,'' the Coast Guard statement said.
   Inspectors told aides to Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, that
they had found records that provided evidence of illegal fishing.
   ``This one is pretty clear-cut,'' said Bill Woolf, a fisheries
expert on Murkowski's staff.
   The Soviet trawler _ believed to be fishing for pollock _ was
observed by the Coast Guard cutter and several electronic ``fixes''
confirmed the ship was fishing inside the exclusive zone, Woolf
said. The ship was observed with its fishing gear in the water, he
said.
   The last time the Coast Guard seized a Soviet fishing vessel in
the North Pacific was in May 1989, when the trawler Novoelnya was
captured with 940 metric tons of pollock aboard. That case was
recently settled when the Soviets agreed to pay $275,000 in fines,
Burgess said.
   Both seizures were in an area of the Bering Sea known as the
``doughnut hole.''
   The ``doughnut hole'' is a circular area surrounded by Soviet
and U.S. exclusive fishing zones where Coast Guard and American
fisheries officials suspect foreign ships await the cover of night
or bad weather to sneak into the fish-rich U.S. zone.
   The United States and several other nations with high-seas
fishing fleets have clashed for years over the rich North Pacific
fisheries.

   Floodwaters gushed through Texas on Thursday after
more than 24 hours of thunderstorms, forcing the evacuation of two
towns and campers to the roofs of their cars. Authorities mobilized
the National Guard and high wind damaged an Air Force base.
   At least three people drowned in Texas and two were missing from
the storms, which were photographed by space shuttle Discovery's
astronauts orbiting 380 miles above Earth. One family was rescued
from a tree.
   Flooding in nearby south-central Oklahoma also forced
evacuations and closed highways.
   The National Weather Service reported up to 16 inches of rain
overnight in some areas of Texas as storms carrying at least nine
tornadoes hop-scotched across the state.
   ``I have never seen it rain this hard. It's raining so hard that
you can hardly see out,'' said Laura Goehl of Stephenville,
southwest of Fort Worth, where more than 150 people waited out the
storm in shelters overnight and into Thursday morning.
   The Texas National Guard sent 35 people and 20 trucks to help
evacuate 200 people from Brownwood, southeast of Abilene, and from
a small rural community on the Brazos River near Weatherford, just
west of Fort Worth.
   ``I can tell you that in Horseshoe Bend everyone has been moved
out. There is no one left,'' said Juanette Kaddatz, a spokeswoman
for Parker County emergency spokeswoman. Officials had no estimates
of its population.
   Ms. Kaddatz said 70 percent of the Parker County community was
under water by mid-afternoon Thursday and the water was rising.
   Police in Brownwood reported all major traffic routes flooded,
some several feet deep. Two of the three deaths were reported in
that town.
   ``The big flood in 1957 was somewhat worse than this, but the
water is still rising,'' said Brownwood police Lt. B.G. Watson.
   About 20 miles northeast of Brownwood, at least 130 people were
evacuated early Thursday in the area of Proctor as Proctor Lake
rose and the rain continued.
   Many had to be rescued by boat after their cars and campers were
flooded at a park near Proctor Lake, which stood 23 feet above its
normal level, its highest on record.
   ``We were pulling these people off the top of their campers and
trailer homes,'' said Sam Marshall, civil defense coordinator.
   ``A lot of the motor homes under water are $100,000 jobs,'' he
said. ``And 28 to 30 have lost new Blazers or new automobiles.''
   Among the evacuees were elderly campers from northern states,
many of whom had to flee without their medication, said police Sgt.
Ron Moe. ``A lot of them have heart problems or are diabetics.''
   In Graham, northwest of Fort Worth, a man and his four children
had to be rescued from trees to which they were clinging by
authorities who used a boat and a human chain to reach them.
Officials said the children were 10 years old and younger.
   Elsewhere in Comanche County, more than a foot of water flooded
the emergency room and first floor of DeLeon Community Hospital. A
hospital spokeswoman said the 23 patients were not in danger.
   Many rural Texas roads and highways were reported closed with
some bridges washed out and others damaged by flash floods, highway
department officials said.
   Other storms early Thursday caused damage at Laughlin Air Force
Base near Del Rio, close to the Mexico border. Wind in excess of
110 mph damaged nine Air Force jets and two buildings, officials
said.
   The jets _ all twin-engine T-37 trainers _ had minor damage,
although one aircraft suffered damage to a wing when it was hit by
a windblown portable lighting cart. The second floor of an office
building collapsed and another building lost its roof.
   Minor damage was reported in Corsicana, where a tornado touched
down and a couple others were spotted at midmorning. Residents of
Highland, near Houston, reported a tornado tore the roofs off two
mobile homes.
   A twister flipped a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 10 east of
Houston, but the driver was uninjured, said Missy Taylor, a
sheriff's dispatcher.
   A four-lane bridge on U.S. Highway 377 about 45 miles northwest
of Dallas was closed because of water damage to its supports, said
James Keller, a Denton County sheriff's deputy.
   Flooding also hit Galveston Island in the Gulf of Mexico, but no
evacuations had been ordered by Thursday night, a sheriff's
dispatcher said.
   A 77-year-old man died Wednesday in Brownwood, when he was swept
away while trying to clear a drain near his home. A second elderly
Brownwood man died Thursday when he was swept away while trying to
get into his car. In the Texas Panhandle, a 27-year-old woman
drowned Wednesday when a car was swept into 13 feet of water in
Moore County and her two companions were missing, authorities said.
   To the north, high water forced the closing of sections of
several state highways in south-central and eastern Oklahoma.
   Billy Frank Lance, a Carter County commissioner, said several
houses in the small town of Dougherty were flooded Wednesday night.
In Healdton, also in Carter County, authorities interrupted a cable
television broadcast Wednesday night to warn viewers to head for
high ground, officials said.

   The Bush administration is resisting heavy
pressure to place Japan on a trade ``hit list,'' but members of
Congress are threatening to block approval of other trade
agreements unless there is a change of heart.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills gave strong indications
Wednesday that Japan will not be targeted a second time as a
country deemed to have erected the most onerous barriers against
sales of American products.
   The issue was to be reviewed today by President Bush's Cabinet,
with a final decision expected before the end of the week.
   The administration a year ago targeted Japan, Brazil and India
under a tough section of the 1988 trade law that provides for
economic retaliation against countries that fail to remove
objectionable trade barriers.

   Some members of Congress are expressing
growing discontent over President Bush's go-slow reaction to the
Soviet Union's crackdown on Lithuania.
   ``I sense that more in Congress are beginning to share our
concern about the administration's policy of inaction,'' said Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., whose state includes a large number of
Lithuanian-Americans.
   If the Soviets continue their economic blockade against the
breakaway Baltic republic, Simon said, ``My guess is that Congress
will lead if the president does not.''
   Lithuanians heaped criticism on Bush after the president
postponed any economic sanctions against Moscow for fear of boxing
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev into a corner, and thus slowing
the pace of Soviet reform.

American countries begun after last winter's invasion of Panama.
   Panama wasn't even likely to be brought up at Quayle's meeting

<HEAD>East German History Museum Takes New Look at Past</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since the revolution, the Museum for German
History in East Berlin is putting more truth and less distortion
into its exhibits covering events of the last 1,500 years.
   Huge chunks of the Berlin Wall stand in the courtyard as part of
a new display about the peaceful uprising that reversed four
decades of Stalinist rule. Less than six months ago, an exhibit
glorified the wall's construction in 1961.
   Museum officials have closed the section covering East Germany's
history from its founding in 1949, which was redone just before the
dramatic political events of autumn 1989.
   They seem embarrassed by their collection of everything from the
office furnishings of the former communist rulers to clothing and
dishes produced at the first state-run enterprises.
   In the section on the period from the end of World War II to the
nation's founding is a new panel acknowledging the museum's ``guilt
and responsibility'' for a display that, ``as we know today
permitted no active, living relation to history and the present.''
   Dr. Kurt Paetzold, a history professor at Humboldt University in
East Berlin, is offering a course this spring called ``Historical
Thinking and History Teaching in the Crises of Our Time.''
   ``There is a need for a course like that,'' he said in an
interview. ``You can't teach as if nothing happened.''
   A new West German guidebook claims the exhibit beginning in 1949
was closed because it offered an ``all too euphoric'' view of East
German history.
   The display on the revolution, opened April 12, has a collection
of banners and posters carried by protesters in pro-democracy
marches.
   Visitors have snapped up sets of postcards with the most famous
slogans. Already sold out is a picture featuring the wide grin and
large teeth of Egon Krenz, the first successor to Erich Honecker,
the leader ousted in October..
   Poor sellers include a book titled ``Lenin in Berlin,'' and
postcards of the Soviet army supplying East Germany with food from
the Soviet Union.
   Despite the tacit apology in the 1945-49 section, the communist
state's creation still is called a ``wonder in the history of the
German people and Europe.'' The Communist Party, which now has
changed its name, is portrayed as incorporating the best traditions
of German history.
   ``This is unbelievable,'' said Klaus Geberts, a retired factory
worker from West Berlin on his first visit to the museum.
   ``One can even laugh; it's not forbidden anymore,'' he said,
inspecting a collection of hand tools that belonged to Wilhelm
Pieck, first president of East Germany.
   ``This museum won't be here much longer,'' Geberts predicted.
   Entries in the guest book indicate, however, that many visitors
believe the exhibits should remain as they are.
   ``Leave everything as it is and build a new one with whole
truth,'' wrote Andreas Kiest, who identified himself as a schoolboy
from West Germany.
   Werner Fuehrer wrote: ``This museum is also part document. Leave
it as is.''
   A Swedish history teacher wrote in imperfect English: ``Please
save this exhibition for the future. It is itself a monument of to
lie with the help of history.''
   The Marxist viewpoint permeates exhibits from the Middle Ages to
1949.
   Medieval conflicts between peasants and rich craftsmen are
portrayed as an example of ``class warfare.'' The defeat of
imperial Germany in World War I was made possible, the exhibit
says, by the efforts of the ``working class.''
   No mention is made of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939,
secret provisions of which divided the independent Baltic states
and much of Poland between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Population Growth Threatens Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The population is growing so fast it
threatens to overwhelm the economy, but the Philippine government,
demographers and Roman Catholic Church can't agree on what to do
about it.
   An official survey conducted in 1988 found the Philippines to be
the 14th most populous country in the world and the eighth in Asia.
   Its population grew from 7.64 million in 1903 to 19 million in
1948, then more than doubled in two decades to 48.1 million in
1980, when the last census was taken, the government report said. A
new census is to be taken this month.
   Official projections put the number of Filipinos at 75 milllion
to 80 million in the year 2000, or 10 times the number a century
ago.
   President Corazon Aquino has called for a program to make sure
the population increase, now about 2.4 percent a year, will not
``outstrip our other resources and annul what gains we make every
year.''
   Government population-control programs have stalled since the
late President Ferdinand E. Marcos fled and Mrs. Aquino gained
power in 1986, with strong support from the Catholic hierarchy.
   Critics say there is little evidence of an effective program or
the political will to forge one.
   Local governments also have been lax because large populations
mean more economic aid from Manila. Virtually all birth control
programs, such as distribution of condoms, are financed by foreign
governments or the United Nations.
   Population growth has declined from a peak of more than 3
percent annually in the 1950s, but Filipinos still multiply faster
than the people of more prosperous nations of Southeast Asia. The
rate is a full percentage point above Thailand and about 0.1
percent ahead of Malaysia.
   Nearly four of 10 Filipinos are under age 15, which strains
educational, health and other public services.
   Officials and demographers say most Filipinos in the rural
areas, where nearly 48 percent of the people live, prefer large
families to provide cheap farm labor. High infant mortality also
encourages having more children.
   Awareness of birth control methods is more widespread, but the
number of couples using them dropped from 45 percent in 1986 to 36
in 1988, according to a survey by the Population Institute at the
University of the Philippines.
   Lack of complete information and the strong male dominance in
Philippine society are major reasons women avoid contraceptives,
officials say.
   Despite growing awareness of the risks of overpopulation,
critics say there is no consensus of the government, church and
demographers on how to avoid it.
   Mamita Pardo de Tavera, secretary of social welfare and head of
the Population Commission, disputes the idea that a large
population must be a national burden.
   She takes a dual approach: educating the public about
contraception and encouraging ``population development,'' or
integration of government aid projects for the poor.
   Those who disagree say the central task is to reduce the number
of births.
   ``You cannot have development unless you have a more manageable
population, in terms of size, growth and composition,'' said
Corazon Raymundo, director of the university Population Institute.
   A major factor in the population debate has been the Roman
Catholic hierarchy, including Cardinal Jaime Sin, archbishop of
Manila, who has great influence in the Aquino administration.
   ``We believe government should create job opportunities, develop
natural resources, harness all these things for the sake of the
people who are living now, not take measures to cut down
population,'' said Monsignor Cesar Pagulayan, spokesman of the
Family Life Apostolate of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the
Philippines.
   Mercedes Concepcion, former dean of the Population Institute,
said the clergy had become aggressive in discouraging use of
contraceptives.
   She said some members of Congress recognize the population
problem, but ``have been silenced by the fact that the cardinal has
been very active in threatening them with hell fire and brimstone .
.. if they do something, particularly in terms of legislation.''
   ``Since there is no signal from the top,'' meaning Mrs. Aquino,
``they know they will be by themselves only, unprotected,'' Mrs.
Concepcion told an interviewer.
   The change in government in February 1986 created a new set of
policy makers ``who have to be conditioned to the situation,'' she
said. ``It's a massive training again.''
   Mrs. Pardo de Tavera said the government program had been
misunderstood.
   ``We are a pluralistic society and we have to give people
choices, not only in the method but in the approaches,'' she said.
``We have to go beyond methods. We have to go to the values,
education, other factors besides fertility.''

   The heightening drama over saving
Florida's dying Everglades has cast new villains, the farmers and
dairymen who work the land around giant Lake Okeechobee.
   Environmentalists say agriculture causes too much pollution in
the precious Okeechobee, which provides water for the vast wetlands
of the Everglades and the cities of the crowded coast. Some argue
it's time to return the land to the wilderness it was before the
ranchers and farmers came about a century ago.
   ``The first thing we have to do is get rid of the sugar cane
south of Lake Okeechobee, then we have to get rid of the dairy
cattle on the north side,'' said Marjory Stoneman Douglas, an
environmental activist who has fought for much of her 100 years to
preserve the Everglades system.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, who's filed suit seeking to force
the state to increase protection of the Everglades, has said that
if farmers can't reduce pollution, ``It's an easy choice. Save the
'Glades and let agriculture move to Wisconsin.''
   Farmers feel they're politically expedient scapegoats. They say
they're threatened by environmental experimentation that has only
one sure result _ a big bill for state-ordered programs to cut
pollution.
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' said David Beardsley, a
fourth-generation farmer near Clewiston. ``It's our land. We're
interested in our home as much as anybody else. But I think we're
an easy target.''
   The nutrient-laden pollutants that run off the farms and dairies
feed unnatural growth of some plants in the Everglades, choking
waterways and disrupting the system's food chain.
   At the same time, the heavy development of south Florida has
disrupted rain patterns and the flow of water into the Everglades,
drying up parts of the system.
   Residents of the region feel the environmental damage. Most are
under some form of water rationing and may soon face stricter
limits. Smoke from wildfires in the Everglades last year closed
highways and caused respiratory problems.
   Gov. Bob Martinez says the environment ranks with crime and
drugs as Florida's top issues.
   The environmental concerns of Floridians coalesced in the
adoption of a ``Save Our Everglades'' plan in 1983. Its aim is
making the Everglades look and function more as it did at the
beginning of the century.
   In 1900, there were no big farms, which disrupt natural water
flow, use water, then discharge pollutants back into the Everglades
system. Nor did 4.5 million people live on the condominium-dotted
``Gold Coast'' from Palm Beach to Miami, sucking huge quantities of
water from the system.
   Sugar growers fare worse than the dairies in their public image
_ of government-subsidized millionaires who exploit foreign cane
cutters and the environment. Two-thirds of the sugar cane land
belongs to U.S. Sugar Corp. or companies owned by the Cuban-born
Fanjul family, invariably described as ``sugar barons.''
   More than 100 other farmers work land in the 700,000-acre
Everglades Agricultural Area south of the lake, however. Some
413,000 acres are in sugar cane, the rest in winter vegetables like
lettuce, celery, cabbage and carrots.
   Beardsley's family started farming when his great-grandfather
came to Okeechobee before World War I and saw the newly drained
land rich in decomposed vegetation.
   ``They just went wild when they saw the dark, rich muck,'' he
said.
   Land was cleared by hand and boats were the only means of
transport for years. Fires and floods from hurricanes made
Okeechobee farming highly risky until the Army Corps of Engineers
began building an extensive drainage and canal system five decades
ago.
   About 1960, decreased sugar production in other U.S. growing
areas resulted in higher domestic quotas; Florida farmers planted
more cane. The U.S. economic embargo against Cuba cut sugar
imports, and soon Florida was the nation's No. 1 cane producer.
   Moving north along the lake, the sweet smoke of the sugar mills
and fields of tall cane give way to stretches of flat pasture
dotted with grazing cattle.
   At McArthur Farms, manager Kent Bowen shows off the farm's ``$4
million experiment'' to cut pollution from 9,000 head of cattle:
waste-collecting barns with concrete floors.
   Beef cattle have been in the area since the 19th century _
Frederic Remington sketched its cattle ranges in the 1890s _ but
dairy operations didn't arrive until the 1960s, when land prices
skyrocketed along the coast.
   Dairy cattle are fed extra phosphorous to enrich their milk for
humans, but too much of it reaches their waste and taints waterways
that feed Okeechobee.
   Reducing the waste flow has proved too costly for some small
operations. At least 14 of the area's 47 dairy operations are
accepting a state offer to move to less-sensitive land _ $602 a
head to get out of town.
   That will cost the water district and state more than $5 million
to move 9,500 cattle, a 20 percent cut in the Okeechobee dairy
population that has produced about a fourth of Florida's milk.
   McArthur Farms plans to stay. ``We've looked at north Florida
and Georgia, but this is a pretty good place to dairy. It's near
the best milk market in Florida,'' Bowen said.
   Bob Butler, whose dairy has 2,200 adult cattle, said pollution
control will cost his farm about $564,000 for fencing and catchment
systems mandated by the state.
   ``We're realizing that we have a problem, and we're trying to
come in and take care of our problems on our own,'' he said.
   Environmentalists give the dairy farmers good marks for effort,
but say the sugar growers are flunking.
   The Everglades Coalition, an umbrella organization of
conservation groups, plans to lobby for an end to federal import
quotas and other indirect subsidies that keep the sugar growers
profitable.
   George Wedgworth, president of the Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative for three decades, says the environmental goals for
Okeechobee are unrealistic because of the vast artificial system
built to support agriculture and protect residents from flooding.
   ``It's not a natural system anymore,'' he said, pointing to a
map of the dikes and canals. ``You can't turn the clock back.''
   Sugar growers levied their own environmental tax last year,
assessing $5 an acre to finance environmental studies.
Conservationists contend it's just a delaying action.
   ``Many of us have been out here a lifetime,'' Wedgworth said.
``We're going to be sure we have the right technical answers to the
problems. We're not going to be distracted by the hysterics of the
time.''

   A new attitude toward the Soviet Union has
already prompted retooling at America's national laboratories, the
three top-secret centers of nuclear weaponry and ``Star Wars''
research and development. As scientists search for new ways to use
their know-how, researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are
finding ways to help clean up the environment.

   The silver trough, as long as a
football field, was developed to harness the sun and help wean the
nation off imported oil. For years, it stood abandoned in the
desert, an obsolete relic of the 1970s.
   Now, in another time and another growing national crisis,
researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have dusted off their
sophisticated solar panels and put them back to work.
   This time, the panels are helping the environment. Sandia
scientists believe they've found an efficient way to use solar
power to break down toxic waste, help clean up polluted dumps and
cleanse contaminated water tables.
   ``We're just helping nature, that's all. There's nothing
artificial about this,'' said Virgil Dugan, Sandia's director of
Advanced Energy Technology.
   Solar research is just one area where scientists at Sandia, one
of the nation's three nuclear weapons laboratories, are finding
ways to help with growing environmental problems.
   As the need for ever improved nuclear weapons lessens, the
laboratories are directing their technological might to greater
peacetime use.
   With expertise developed for weapons programs and Army
machinery, ``smart'' robots are hurriedly being assembled to clean
out highly radioactive and toxic chemical waste at Department of
Energy weapons plants across the country.
   ``It's the same technology (that goes into weapons programs),
even though it seems there are two different applications,'' said
Pat Eicker, manager of Robotic Science and Technology at Sandia.
   In the case of the abandoned solar collector, scientists
realized they might be able to run contaminated water, such as
polluted ground water, through the sunlight-focusing machine and
use its power to help break down organic toxic waste.
   The contaminated water is mixed with a catalyst _ titanium
dioxide _ and pumped through a clear tube in the center of the
long, parabolic solar trough.
   The tube glows like Darth Vader's sword as sunlight activates
the titanium dioxide, which frees an electron. The electron grabs
onto organic material, in this case, the contaminates, and breaks
them down into water, carbon dioxide and a mild, harmless acid.
   Until a full-scale experiment last June, scientists weren't sure
if the solar machine would cause complete destruction of the
pollutants. It did.
   ``You can drink the water that comes out at the end,'' said Mike
Prairie, a senior technical staff member on the solar project.
   ``We never did this before because nobody thought of it
before,'' Dugan said. ``Some might say it's a breakthrough. I think
of it as an engineering advancement.''
   Companies are lining up to learn more about Sandia's gadget,
Dugan said. The laboratory plans to have a trial system out in a
year, and Dugan thinks the system is about four years away from
commercial use.
   Sandia has been testing the system with water contaminated by
trichloroethylene, a common degreasing substance that contaminates
ground water. Scientists believe the system will also work on PCBs,
dioxins, pesticides, dyes, solvents and other organic, or
carbon-based, materials.
   The solar panels won't help with the problem of nuclear waste,
however, because that is inorganic.
   Companies must now package their toxic waste and ship it to dump
sites or incinerators. The solar system might be economical enough
to allow even small firms to have on-site waste systems and also
may be portable, Dugan said. It will likely be more efficient, and
cheaper, than current ground water purification systems, he said.
   Sandia's robotics researchers began eight years ago to find ways
to use machines for the sometimes dangerous work of building
nuclear weapons and handling plutonium and other hazardous parts.
   Already the lab has created a ``smart'' manufacturing system
that will help automate some production in weapons plants. It has
also designed wheeled robotic vehicles for the Army.
   Now work is under way to create a system that can clean up toxic
areas too dangerous for humans to venture into at Department of
Energy weapons plants, such as Hanford, Wash.; Savannah River, Ga.;
Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Fernald, Ohio, and Pantex, Texas.
   Scientists say a robotic backhoe will be used at highly
radioactive and toxic pits, along with a 40-foot robotic arm with
sight and radar capabilities that can scan a dump, map pipes and
other obstacles, vacuum sand and dirt, lift and remove drums, and
clean leaking underground storage tanks.
   ``You've got to have some way to get in there and recover this
stuff,'' Eicker said. ``And it's so dangerous, people can't do it.''
   In one shed at Sandia, researchers hastily built a
one-tenth-scale model of a waste dump, along with a robotic arm,
because of a DOE rush to begin the cleanups.
   ``The use of models to simulate situations and the use of
sensors to facilitate work on nuclear weapons production is what
motivated this research,'' Eicker said.
   ``But this has far-reaching applications.''

   Early in the NBC drama ``Fall From Grace,'' TV
preacher Jim Bakker, anguished and seeking comfort from an old
minister friend, confesses a moment of adultery with Jessica Hahn.
He then says this:
   ``Trying to build PTL into a worldwide ministry, the government
attacking me about taxes, the newspapers writing stories about me,
my marriage falling apart, a live television show six days a week _
the pressures never let up.
   ``I ... I just wasn't thinking straight.''
   Later in the show, he snaps at an aide: ``Why does everyone want
to nail Jim Bakker to the cross?''
   It may be that those to whom the TV preacher refers had no
advance knowledge his sad story would become a bad TV movie. This
has come to pass, so they can stop singing ``If I Had a Hammer.''
   NBC bought the TV rights from the Bakkers for an undisclosed sum
and got their help in making what has emerged as ``Fall From
Grace.'' It stars Kevin Spacey and Bernadette Peters, who play the
Bakkers and lose.
   Airing Sunday, the movie dramatizes their descent from fiscal
and evangelical heaven after the devil in the form of the Justice
Department halts Bakker's works and his multimillion-dollar PTL
empire.
   It'll probably get sky-high ratings, even though it's opposite
ABC's ``The Story of the Beach Boys,'' a dramatization of the
private woes of the lads who became a Major Cultural Force just by
singing ``Surfin' U.S.A.''
   But NBC's two-hour Bakkerarama sure gives awful a bad name.
Directed by Karen Arthur with a 10-ton touch, it's written by Ken
Trevey as if he sought divine guidance and got a busy signal.
   Although it tries to show the pain and frailty of the Bakkers,
the show at times seems to be unconscious or semiconscious satire.
Consider its opening moments, a vague version of the Hahn-Bakker
coupling in Florida.
   Bare-chested and abed, he clutches her hand and advises, ``I've
been through hell.'' Whooo. As they start to commune, her hand
knocks over a glass of wine, spilling the grog onto a Bible on a
nightstand. Make that two whoos.
   (Alas, she's not heard from again, save for furtive letters
demanding alms. She's given what the vulgar call hush money.)
   Things end with the sex scandal out, Bakker awaiting federal
indictments and the couple in Palm Springs, Calif., bravely facing
disgrace, reporters and, although this is not mentioned,
``Nightline.''
   In between? Well, you've got Peters busy chewing the scenery as
her character's emotional stability steadily is shredded and her
Tammy-brand mascara grows heavier with each crisis.
   The crises, such as buying sprees, an over-the-counter drug
problem and pneumonia that almost kills her, are depicted as
stemming from her frustration as her husband increasingly shuns her
for work, work, work.
   Spacey's Bakker seems terminally vague, a Nowhere Man of no
fixed philosophical address, an avaricious innocent harried by the
Internal Revenue Service and snoopy reporters from the Charlotte
Observer.
   At least he seems to notice that his wife's increasily erratic
behavior may involve drugs of some sort. He even asks, ``Tammy, you
been taking that medicine again?''
   He twice curls up on the floor in tears, and shouts at his wife
and aides as life gets worse. But he shows real emotion only on two
occasions, the first when his wife is at death's door.
   The second occasion is when the rival Rev. Jerry Falwell, to
whom he has been forced to turn over control of PTL, castigates
him, alludes to ``homosexual problems,'' and does it all ... on TV!
   Bakker goes plumb bozo watching Falwell (Richard Paul plays him
as a victim of extreme unction). A sympathetic Tammy says nobody
will believe Falwell's charges.
   ``Yes, they will,'' Bakker roars tearfully. ``People will
believe anything they see'' _ he slaps at the TV screen _ ``on
that!''
   Unkind things also are said in ``Grace'' about rival TV
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who also scathingly denounced Bakker but
later tearfully confessed he, too, had sinned (he didn't say if the
sin was of the flesh or what).
   Although it is written, ``Let he who is without sin cast the
first TV movie,'' NBC's rehash of the Bakkers' woes does seem a
little soon.
   The real story ended only last October when Bakker, still
protesting his innocence, was sentenced to 45 years in prison and
fined $500,000 for using his TV show to defraud his flock.
   Oh, well. Consider that a famous person's life sometimes can be
measured in whether it's made into a real movie or a TV movie.
   George S. Patton got a real movie, Ollie North a TV movie. Glenn
Miller got a real movie, Liberace two TV movies. Moses got a real
movie. But Jim and Tammy Bakker have gotten NBC's version of
eternity.

<HEAD>What Are You Paying For Services?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you are one of those people whose own
inflation rate is rising faster than the official consumer price
index, perhaps you might find the answer in the cost of services.
   For reasons not entirely clear, many people have a tendency to
measure the prices they pay for tangible items _ for food, cars,
houses and household goods and the like _ but are less aware of
rises elsewhere.
   ``Elsewhere'' is the service as opposed to the goods sector, and
it makes up by far the larger category, including health care, food
vending, hair styling, banking, government, education, law and more.
   Not only is the service sector bigger, but prices there are
rising much faster than in the goods sector. Price rises in health
care, for example, have exceeded the general inflation rate for
many years, including this one.
   Officially, the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of
0.5 percent in March. But within that rate was a significant split:
Goods inflation was but 0.2 percent; service inflation, 0.7 percent.
   While the dichotomy could be temporary, it also might be
fundamental and difficult to contain.
   How, for example, do you restrain health-care prices when lives
are at stake? How do you offset mandated minimum wage increases in
retailing? Do you really want to lower education costs while your
children are in school?
   Some of those increases tend to sneak up on you. While you might
buy food each day, you might avail yourself of a doctor's services
only a couple of times a year, and a lawyer's services even less,
and so lose a sense of price.
   A report by the Coalition of Service Industries gives a portrait
of the service sector that might surprise many people. To
illustrate, nine out of 10 workers added to the labor force since
1982 have been employed in services.
   Last year, nearly all the 2.5 million workers who entered the
labor force found jobs in services. Goods producers added only
30,000 workers.
   The service society also is growing relentlessly. Two decades
ago it occupied two-thirds of the labor force; today, there are
three workers in services for every one in goods production.
   Meanwhile, service productivity has been lagging, and for an
obvious reason: whereas goods production can be automated, the
production of services is labor-intensive. Consider your landlord,
barber, teacher, doctor, waiter.
   Some of those trends will continue. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics projects the formation of another 18 million jobs by the
year 2000, an average of about 1.5 million a year, and most of the
jobs will be in services.
   Total employment is expected to rise from 118 million in 1988 to
136 million by the turn of the century. Employment in services is
projected to rise to 79 percent of all non-farm wage and salary
jobs from 75.9 percent in 1988.
   It means, obviously, that jobs in the goods sector as a
percentage of the whole will continue to decline. And remember,
productivity increases, which tend to restrain price increases, are
hardest to achieve in the service sector.
   While these generalities are based on the workings of the
economy in general, the chances are high that your own personal
economy is subject to the same pressures.

<HEAD>Pope Trip Highlights Church's Decade of Change in Latin America</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II is making another trip to
Latin America, where the Roman Catholic church has changed
dramatically in the 11 years since he first outlined his vision of
its role.
   The nine-day visit to Mexico, starting Sunday, will underline
the changes since 1979, when John Paul set the tone of his papacy
toward church activism in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic region.
   Maintain your commitment to the poor, the pope told his bishops
in Puebla, Mexico, but do not become partisan politicians.
   In the ensuing years, the church has assumed a greater role in
social and economic affairs and gained broader prestige in Latin
America, but divisions have emerged between liberal and
conservative clergy.
   From without, the church is increasingly threatened by the
aggressive proselytizing of evangelical Protestant churches.
   It is challenged by the dramatic growth of poverty in a region
of vital concern to the Vatican. This is John Paul's 10th trip to
Latin America and he also plans to visit Cuba, perhaps in December.
   Latin Americans make up nearly half the world's 850 million
Catholics. The Latin church has influenced Catholicism worldwide
with its bold efforts to adapt the gospel to Third World societies.
   Liberation theology, which links spiritual freedom to liberation
from economic and social oppression, was born in Latin Ameria. John
Paul has sought to blunt the philosophy's effect.
   ``Certainly, what I feel in the last few years is what we feel a
little in the universal church; it is a moment of what some call
conservatism,'' said the Rev. Irineu Wilges, a Brazilian who is the
Franciscan order's counselor for Latin America.
   Despite that conservatism, the Latin American church leadership
has transformed itself.
   Cardinals and bishops, once close to the ruling minority, began
condemning political repression in the 1970s, when brutal
dictatorships were common. Frequently, the church was the only
institution strong enough to stand up to the government.
   Catholic officials who specialize in Latin America say the
church leadership has extended its political role in three ways:
   _Encouraging the establishment of democracy, particularly in
Brazil and Chile.
   _Serving as a mediator between the government and guerrillas, as
in Nicaragua and El Salvador.
   _Speaking out on problems facing new, fragile democracies, such
as land reform, foreign debt and the rights of native Indians.
   Those actions reflect the church's widespread credibility in
Latin America and its effort to grow closer to the poor.
   ``The people have much more faith in the church than they did 10
years ago,'' said the Rev. Jose Luis Castaneda, a Peruvian who is
the Jesuit order's regional assistant for South America. ``I don't
know if it's the merit of the church or the disasters of the
politicians.''
   John Paul has supported the Latin church's ``option for the
poor,'' declared at a 1968 conference of bishops in Medellin,
Colombia.
   On trips to the region, the pope has assailed dictatorship,
highlighted the foreign debt problem and defended labor unions. He
also has condemned liberation theology that uses Marxist analysis
and warned clerics to stay out of politics.
   Action has accompanied his words, particuarly in Brazil, whose
bishops have encouraged liberation theology. Brazil has about
100,000 ``ecclesiastical base communities,'' church-sponsored
groups that press for political and social change.
   The Vatican promoted conservatives in Brazil, which has moved
the bishops conference to a more centrist position.
   In 1985 it ordered the Rev. Leonardo Boff, Brazil's most
prominent progressive theologian, to maintain ``obedient silence''
for a year.
   Last year, the Vatican divided the Paolo archdiocese of another
progressive, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, into five smaller
dioceses, seriously diminishing his influence.
   ``It isn't that some people are for helping the poor and some
are against,'' Wilges said. ``The church is divided over how to do
it.''
   Divisions between liberals and progressives have deepened
because of the actions in Brazil and similar ones in other
countries.
   Last year, the Vatican ignored the choice of the organization's
own leadership in choosing a new secretary-general of the Latin
American Confederation of Religious, prompting an outcry from
priests and nuns.
   Religious orders account for about 80 percent of the priests and
nuns in Latin America. Their members tend to be more liberal than
diocesan clergy and bishops.
   The Vatican acted after the confederation introduced a
Bible-study program for members that the Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith condemned as too ``ideological.''
   Whatever the internal problems, many church officials say Latin
American Catholicism's greatest challenge is from conservative
evangelical churches on the outside.
   Non-Catholics in the region now number more than 30 million, the
Latin American bishops conference says.
   In Mexico, the number of Protestants grew more than 500 percent
in 1950-1980, to 2.2 million, according to church figures. In some
Mexican states, up to 20 percent of the people are believed to be
non-Catholic.
   Some Catholic officials contend the church's approach to faith
has been too political or intellectual. Others claim the
evangelical churches receive money from the U.S. government or
businesses hoping to hinder church efforts for social change.
   Officials say greater poverty and ever-growing urban slums
create serious problems for the church in spreading its message.
Activism on behalf of the poor continues to exact a price, as shown
by the murder of six Jesuits by Salvadoran soldiers in November.
   ``The standard of living is ... lamentably regressive,'' Bishop
Dario Castrillon Hoyos, president of the bishops conference, said
in a recent report.
   ``We must therefore ask ourselves what have been the results of
the church's effort to raise people's consciences, and of the
political commitment of Catholics.''

   Life-and-death questions once left to God and
the family doctor may soon be answered in Oregon by legislators
poring over a computerized, prioritized, cost-analyzed printout of
ailments and treatments.
   The printout, ranking the relative benefits of 3,000 medical
procedures, is due out this week after researchers spent months
determining how Oregonians get sick and injured.
   The next step is for legislators to take the list, search their
souls, and draw a line. Above the line will be illnesses covered
under the state's Medicaid program for the poor. Below it will be
ailments the poor must live with _ and sometimes die with.
   Welcome to medical rationing, Oregon style.
   Proponents say it's a necessary evil in an age of limited
budgets and $200,000 liver transplants. And Oregon's high-tech
approach is being watched closely by other states facing the same
high-tech question: Can we afford the miracles of modern medicine?
   ``We can transplant hearts and lungs and livers and parts of the
pancreas. We can do far more with trauma victims than ever
before,'' said Connie Thomas of the Intergovernmental Health Policy
Project, a research group in Washington, D.C.
   ``But deciding how to use those technologies in a fair and
cost-effective way has eluded us all.''
   The glowing success of organ transplants, for instance, is
tarnished by the fact that nearly all patients first undergo
``wallet biopsies'' to see if they can afford the costly surgery.
   Every wonder drug or surgical breakthrough raises uneasy
questions of who will be excluded. Should society pay to transplant
a chronic alcoholic's damaged liver, even though he'll go through
the new one in a couple years? Should a bedridden 90-year-old get
triple-bypass heart surgery, even though other ailments will likely
kill her within a year? What if she's 60?
   Once only the poor had to worry about being locked out of health
care. But as medical costs rise, many middle-class Americans are
feeling poor when it's time to pay the doctor:
   _ U.S. health-care spending this year is expected to exceed $600
billion, or about 12 percent of the gross national product, up from
7 percent in 1970, federal health officials say.
   _ Some 31.5 million people, or 13 percent of all Americans, have
neither health insurance nor Medicaid coverage, the Census Bureau
says.
   _ Even Americans with company health plans are being asked to
pay more. And those plans may decrease in value, as insurance
companies ponder dropping costly procedures from standard coverage.
   Medical rationing looms as a dominant health care issue of the
1990s, as Americans realize after decades of revolutionary medical
advances that there are no miracles, just hard choices.
   ``Health care is a world of limited resources and infinite
demand,'' said Dr. Arthur Feinberg, regent of the American College
of Physicians. ``It comes down to a question of who lives, who dies
_ and who decides.''
   Indeed, who should decide?
   Doctors avoid the debate, saying their allegiance is to the
individual patient, regardless of society's cost.
   Congress may seem a logical place to tackle the issue, but don't
expect miracles there, either. National health care has long been
batted around Washington, but the estimated annual price tag of $65
billion dampens enthusiasm.
   For now, the issue of health care sits with the states, nowhere
more heavily than in Oregon.
   The story here began in 1987, when a cash-strapped Legislature
halted Medicaid funding for most organ transplants, saving the
money for other health needs such as prenatal care. Only two other
states, Virginia and Arizona, exclude transplants.
   Oregon's decision drew little notice at first. Then Coby Howard,
a 7-year-old leukemia victim, died as his family tried to raise
contributions for a bone marrow transplant.
   Suddenly health-care allocation was an issue, kept alive by a
stream of publicized hardship cases. Advocates for transplant
patients and the poor demanded a new way of distributing state
Medicaid dollars. Last June the Legislature gave them one.
   It was less _ and more _ than they expected.
   Legislators tackled a basic inequity of the state-federal
Medicaid program. Congress designed Medicaid to provide health care
to the poor, but millions of poor Americans don't qualify.
   That's because states adjust eligibility standards each year to
match their budgets. The lowest standards are in Alabama, where a
family of two qualifies only if it earns less than $88 a month, or
13 percent of the federal poverty level of $700 a month for one
parent and child. The national eligibility average is 50 percent of
the poverty level.
   Oregon decided to expand its 60 percent coverage to 100 percent
of the poverty level, adding as many as 120,000 people to Medicaid
rolls. The Legislature also passed a bill requiring employers to
provide basic health insurance.
   The idea was to stop rationing people out of health care and
start rationing services instead. The problem was finding a fair
way to decide which services to cut.
   The newly created Oregon Health Services Commission held 61
public meetings. More than 50 committees of medical specialists
compiled thick reports, listing ailments along with the cost and
effectiveness of treatments. A telephone survey asked Oregonians to
rate illnesses in terms of how they would impair their lives, from
death at 0 to perfect health at 100.
   This mountain of data was crunched into a complex formula, and
an all-night computer run produced a list of costs and benefits for
treating 3,000 illnesses, from appendicitis to herpes zoster.
   The preliminary list will be released May 2 at a commission
meeting in Portland. But the real test comes in January, when the
Legislature must decide how far down the list funding will go.
   A treatment such as polio vaccine will no doubt rank high on the
list; it's cheap and extremely effective. High-cost bone marrow
transplants may be near the bottom.
   ``We don't have enough money to do everything,'' said state
Senate President John Kitzhaber, an emergency room physician who
masterminded the plan.
   A child dying for want of a liver transplant is sad, Kitzhaber
acknowledged, but no sadder than a woman nine months pregnant
seeing her first doctor in the emergency room, or patients
staggered by pneumonia because they couldn't afford a doctor's care
for flu.
   ``Most people don't have a need for the things that get most of
the publicity,'' he said. ``The services most people are losing
access to are things like treatment of minor trauma and respiratory
infections _ common things that occur commonly.''
   Oregon needs a congressional waiver of Medicaid rules to
implement its plan, and that is not guaranteed. Critics in Congress
and elsewhere say Oregon legislators are using technical
hocus-pocus to justify unneeded rationing.
   ``Asking the poor to fight among themselves over the crumbs of
the Medicaid program is not my idea of a courageous policy,'' said
Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for
Biomedical Ethics.
   ``We have lots of reasons to believe that the health-care system
is bloated and inefficient. Before we ration anybody out of the
health-care lifeboat, I think we ought to trim that bureaucracy.''
   Even those who differ agree that Oregon's plan has raised
awareness about setting priorities. And that, said researcher
Thomas, is progress for a society once too proud to talk about it.
   ``We were the country without limits,'' she said. ``Now people
are talking about rationing, about death and dying. That never
would have happened a few years ago.''

<TEXT>
   Seventeen years ago, Congress took a small
step toward national health insurance when it decided to take on
the costs of life-saving treatment for nearly all Americans whose
kidneys had failed.
   It was supposed to cost about $200 million a year.
   Today, the cost is more than $3.3 billion.
   ``If the kidney program were to come up today, it would be
completely dead in the water ... because of the obsession to bring
costs down,'' said Arthur Caplan, head of the University of
Minnesota's Center for Biomedical Ethics.
   ``The reason we don't have national health insurance is the
kidney program,'' he said. ``The costs associated with it scared
legislators out of their gourds.''
   In the early 1970s, government money was flowing more freely and
only dollars stood in the way of life-saving treatment for the many
thousands of people whose kidneys failed.
   The success rate of kidney transplants was up, but this option
was expensive and limited by the supply of donated organs.
   The other effective option, the artificial kidney machine that
cleans the blood of toxins in a process called dialysis, was also
expensive. However, the number of patients who needed the
relatively new procedure was far greater than the supply of
machines could handle.
   Life-saving treatment was being rationed by hospital committees
that were deciding, essentially, who would live and who would die.
   The technology to save lives was there. As Sen. Vance Hartke,
D-Ind., posed the question on the Senate floor in 1972: ``How do we
explain that the difference between life and death is a matter of
dollars?''
   That year, Congress extended Medicare coverage to nearly all
patients in the advanced stages of kidney disease, regardless of
age.
   With this coverage, patients pay about 20 percent of the cost of
treatment _ whether transplant or dialysis _ and the federal
government pays 80 percent.
   The medical industry responded by building dialysis treatment
centers across the country. There are now about 1,800 centers, with
80 to 90 added each year.
   More than 80 percent of dialysis patients go to one of these
centers three times a week for treatments that last four to six
hours each, at a cost of about $25,000 to $30,000 annually. The
remainder are treated in their homes, at around $20,000 a year.
   Caplan asserts that the kidney program has been a ``bonanza for
for-profit medicine'' and says the program's price tag could be cut
considerably if the government encouraged more home treatment. In
Britain, he said, 66 percent of dialysis patients are treated in
their homes.
   But that issue aside, even in the early years of the program, it
was apparent that Congress had vastly underestimated the cost of
dialysis and transplants, which now run about $25,000 per patient
plus several thousand dollars a year for anti-rejection drugs.
   And as the costs rose steadily, the profile of kidney patients
getting the life-saving treatment changed.
   Before the program, three of four dialysis patients were men,
most were well-educated, almost 42 percent had jobs, 91 percent
were white, and only 7 percent were over 55. By 1981, more than 45
percent were over 55, half were women, 35 percent were black and
only 18 percent were working, researchers reported at the time.
   Now, the elderly are the fastest growing group on dialysis, with
about 30 percent of patients over 65.
   Physicians ``are under a great deal of pressure from family and
patients (to use dialysis) even when the prognosis is poor,'' said
Daniel Callahan, director of The Hastings Center in Briarciff
Manor, N.Y., an independent nonprofit research organization that
examines ethical issues in medicine.
   The latest government figures available put the cost of the
program in 1987 at $3.3 billion and rising by about $300 million a
year. Some 147,000 patients had coverage under the program at some
time in that year.
   ``We have chosen not to make difficult choices with this
disease,'' said Paul Rettig, executive director of the American
Hospital Association. ``The money is in the Medicare program ...
and we made a financial choice to pay for it.''
   But government money does not flow so freely now, and lawmakers
are looking around every corner for places to cut the budget.
   Few suggest turning back the clock with repeal of the kidney
program, but some question use of transplants and dialysis in
``marginal'' patients, those who have other medical problems and
are not likely to live long in any event.
   The fundamental question is how scarce resources should be
spread among all who need them, said Richard A. Rettig, who is
directing an Institute of Medicine study on the kidney program.
   ``This is one of those things we recognize as a source of
anxiety. We walk up to it and walk away from it and walk around it,
because we have no way to decently confront it directly,'' he said.
   ``The renal world did confront it in the 1960s, they were
relieved from doing so in the '70s and '80s,'' he said, ``but the
question doesn't go away.''

   Lawton Chiles compared himself to Abraham
Lincoln when he told Floridians he was being treated for
depression. But he may be more like Tom Eagleton _ and that bodes
well for his gubernatorial prospects.
   Eagleton was forced off the Democrats' 1972 presidential ticket
after disclosures that he'd had shock treatment for depression. But
two years later, Missouri voters re-elected him to the Senate by a
landslide.
   Like Eagleton, Chiles is well-known and well-liked in his state.
And that familiarity, analysts say, is key to how voters treat
candidates who have acknowledged problems such as mental illness,
drug abuse and alcoholism.
   Tom Kiley, an adviser to Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis in 1988 and to Eagleton in his 1974 Senate race, said such
troubles are a legitimate campaign issue because they bear on
questions of judgment. But they can be blown out of proportion when
voters don't know a candidate well, he said.
   When people are familiar with a politician, ``it's a lot easier
for them to weigh the information, put it in context and come to a
conclusion about the role it should play in an election,'' Kiley
said.
   Rumors of depression swirled briefly around Dukakis shortly
after he became the Democratic presidential nominee. He suffered
considerable damage by failing to squelch them promptly, largely
because he was new on the national scene.
   ``People had no long-term familiarity and personal information
to fall back on,'' Kiley said.
   That is not the case with Chiles, who served three Senate terms
before quitting in 1988. He blamed burnout and frustration.
   But leaving the capital didn't cure his blue moods, insomnia and
lack of appetite. Only when Chiles started taking Prozac, a common
medication for depression, did his spirits rise and his political
drive return.
   Chiles entered the Florida governor's race this month and became
the instant favorite over both Rep. Bill Nelson, his chief rival in
the Democratic primary, and incumbent GOP Gov. Bob Martinez. Polls
showed him the clear leader even after people were told he was
taking medication for depression.
   Other candidates have been raising questions about Chiles'
mental state, both indirectly and head-on. ``If Lawton is depressed
sitting 18 years in committee meetings in Washington, if he spends
about 13 minutes in the governor's chair he may blow his brains
out,'' said former Gov. Claude R. Kirk Jr., who is challenging
Martinez in the GOP primary.
   Eagleton's Missouri constituents apparently were unperturbed
that he had received shock treatment. They sent him back to the
Senate with 60 percent of the vote only two years after he was
forced off the national ticket headed by George McGovern. His
stability was not an issue in the campaign.
   ``It was obvious that voters didn't have any lingering concerns
that needed to be addressed,'' Kiley said. ``He was held in high
regard.''
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., the only psychiatrist in Congress,
said any candidate who raises mental health questions about an
opponent must be grasping for issues. Candidates should be judged
by how well they perform under stress, not by the medication
they're taking, he said.
   ``Abraham Lincoln probably would not have been qualified for the
presidency if this were a disqualifying problem,'' McDermott said,
referring to Lincoln's well-known bouts of melancholia.
   Frank Mankiewicz, who was McGovern's campaign manager in 1972,
said voters find mental illness ``a lot less frightening and
therefore less of a stigma'' now that it typically is treated with
medication rather than shock therapy.
   He and others say voters generally have become more sympathetic
to candidates fighting alcoholism, depression and other illnesses
as the problems have become more widely acknowledged in society.
Most families have had first-hand experience with such troubles,
Kiley said.
   And increasingly, candidates are opening up to voters and
counting on their understanding.
   Kiley cited Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, a recovering alcoholic
who won a hard-fought Democratic gubernatorial primary, as a case
in point. Voters seem to accept her explanation of her illness and
treatment, Kiley said.
   ``Chiles is in a similar position,'' he said. ``He has great
credibility, he's widely respected. He can talk with great candor
about this aspect of his background and expect to get the fairest
possible hearing from voters.''
   Mankiewicz said voters might be less touchy about Chiles' mental
health because he is running for state rather than national office.
``After all,'' he said, ``the governor of Florida doesn't have his
finger on the button.''

   Alderman Michael McGee scares some people,
disgusts others. He certainly has them talking.
   McGee began recruiting street gang members and others in March
for a ``Black Panther Community Militia'' and threatened to send it
on terrorist attacks if his demands for improvements in the inner
city weren't met by 1995. Likely targets would be sporting events
and busy freeways, he said.
   He claims the ``militia'' already has 500 members.
   One anti-crime activist predicts people are going to get hurt.
The mayor says McGee should resign unless he renounces violence,
but also urges calm and asks people to look beyond McGee's rhetoric
to examine the poverty and violence in the inner city.
   McGee says he has worked within the system most of his public
career, whether as a Vietnam War medic, political activist or
alderman. But he says he's fed up with the system's failure to
improve the life of poor minorities in one of the nation's most
segregated cities.
   ``I've been doing things the so-called right way,'' McGee said.
``I'm opposed to violence, but I think at some point it becomes
cowardliness on the part of the black community to keep letting
people abuse us.''
   McGee wants the city to spend $100 million on training and jobs
for inner-city residents, redraw aldermanic districts to improve
minority representation on the Common Council and implement some of
a task force's recommendations for improving unemployment, crime,
teen pregnancy and other social ills among minorities.
   He is one of three blacks on the 16-member council.
   In his five years as an alderman representing a mostly black,
poor, crime-ridden district on Milwaukee's north side, McGee has
staged other protests to call attention to the inner city.
   He once led a whistle-blowing demonstration during a visit by
Jimmy Carter, claiming the former president's effort to build homes
in inner-city areas was a facade that helped few if any.
   Another time he wore a paper bag over his head for the annual
Common Council photograph, saying he was embarrassed to be seen
with the council after it approved a city budget that cut services
to the inner city.
   Many people, including some constituents, were angered by
McGee's threats. Some called for his removal from office.
   ``This Black Panther thing has caught me completely off guard. I
think it's going to get a lot of people hurt,'' said Queen Hyler,
who heads the anti-crime group Stop the Violence that recently was
praised by President Bush.
   She asked McGee to resign and has threatened to circulate
petitions in his district seeking a recall election.
   Ms. Hyler first met McGee in 1981 when they worked together in a
movement that helped win a $600,000 settlement for the family of a
22-year-old black man who died in police custody.
   McGee used to ``demonstrate and march like everyone else,'' she
said, but in recent years he's been ``a little bolder once he got
some political clout behind him.''
   Others, including Mayor John Norquist, Common Council members
and clergy, denounced the threats of violence, but they also urged
people to consider the conditions that anger McGee.
   ``It's easy for us to focus on Michael McGee and ignore the
violence that already exists,'' said Jack Murtaugh, executive
director of the Interfaith Conference of Milwaukee, a religious
group of 11 denominations. ``It appeared to us there had been an
escalation of words and more attention focused on Michael McGee
than on the issues.''
   Murtaugh said McGee wants only to rectify the ``violence of
racism'' that has isolated blacks within an 8- by 5-mile block on
the city's north side that is plagued by crime, poverty, unsafe
housing and unemployment.
   Common Council President Thomas P. Donegan said some of McGee's
demands may be met. In the meantime, Donegan said, he senses McGee
may be toning down some threats.
   ``I think what Mike is saying to people who want to be in his
militia now is a lot more positive. ... I think he has, without
admitting it, backed down from some of his earlier, more violent
statements,'' Donegan said.
   McGee, who worked for the original Black Panthers group in the
1970s, counts among his heroes such black leaders as Nat Turner,
who led a slave revolt; Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican activist in the
1920s, and Malcolm X, the assassinated Black Muslim leader.
   He said his militia will be used for neighborhood patrols and
economic boycotts while also undergoing military training. ``We're
going to continue to do a lot of non-violent things between now and
1995,'' he said.
   ``I'd worry more if I wasn't doing what I'm doing. It would take
a bigger toll,'' he said. ``I would suffer twice as much. If you're
not doing anything it'll eat you alive.''
   McGee said he would remain on the Common Council even though the
mayor and others have said he should resign if he continues to
advocate violence.
   ``I have no plans of giving up my participation. I think that's
what a politician should be about _ leading the people,'' he said.
``In 1995 when I start kicking butt in Milwaukee, I'll still be an
alderman.''

   If takeover strategist Carl Icahn gets his
way, the steel division of USX Corp. will stand alone in a leaner,
meaner industry 89 years after it became the first billion-dollar
company.
   The move would be a sign of the times in a changing market where
larger producers are slimming down to battle foreign competitors
and specialized ``mini-mills'' that are claiming a growing piece of
the pie.
   ``Once upon a time in dim history, steel mills made things,
stuck them in a warehouse and said, `Come and buy them,''' said
Sheldon Wesson, spokesman for the American Iron and Steel
Institute, a Washington trade group.
   ``That is no longer true,'' he said. ``The whole trend is to
tailor-make product, quality and quantities that customers want and
when they want it. It's an entirely different philosophy and an
entirely different business orientation.''
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder with a 13.3 percent stake,
wants USX to exit the steel business because he contends it's a
potential drag on the company if there's an economic downturn.
Icahn wants USX to concentrate on its energy businesses.
   Shareholders will vote May 7 at the company's annual meeting in
Findlay, Ohio, on Icahn's non-binding proposal that USX spin off at
least 80 percent of the steel business into a separate company
called U.S. Steel Corp., the name used by USX until 1986.
   Icahn said his proposal is no indication he has lost faith in
the profitability of the American steel industry.
   ``I think the long-term future is good for steel,'' he said.
``The infrastructure of this country has been neglected for so long
sooner or later we're going to need steel to rebuild our roads and
bridges.''
   American steel shipments increased steadily through most of the
1980s. Last year, 84.1 million tons of steel were shipped by
American makers, compared with 61.6 million in 1982.
   But analysts said as the U.S. economy moves away from
manufacturing and toward more service-based businesses, demand for
steel and the industry's strength could erode.
   Moreover, because today's steel is lighter and stronger, less
will be needed in new cars, bridges and skyscrapers.
   ``It's not so much a question of steel declining as it is a
question of other segments of the economy growing more rapidly,''
said Donald F. Barnett, an independent consultant in McLean, Va.
``Steel will continue to perform an essential service, but it's not
going to be one of the most rapidly growing segments of the
economy.''
   Analysts said Icahn's proposal, if carried out, would be just
another restructuring in a smokestack industry that has gone
through wrenching upheavals for years.
   ``The industry is continuing to fragment,'' Barnett said. ``USX
is a large company that could become smaller. The restructuring
process doesn't seem likely to end in our lifetime.''
   The nation's steel industry blossomed in the 1870s, when
industrialist Andrew Carnegie and seven associates built the Edgar
Thomson Works near Pittsburgh to make steel for industrial
expansion.
   Carnegie increased his market share by expanding and acquiring
competitors and finally sold his steel interests in 1901 to J.P.
Morgan to form the United States Steel Corp.
   The company's focus remained on steel until March 1982, when
U.S. Steel merged with Marathon Oil Co. in what then was the
second-largest corporate merger in American history.
   ``USX has been a leader,'' said Charles A. Bradford, an
independent steel analyst. ``It used to be a policeman of the
industry on a pricing basis. They could be brutal if they were
undercut.''
   The company remains the nation's largest steel producer, but
Bradford estimates its capacity has decreased to less than
one-fifth of the industry from about two-thirds in the 1920s.
   ``Everybody looks at USX as if it's the big part of the
industry,'' he said. ``It's the shrinking part.''
   Steel companies suffered loss after loss in the first half of
the 1980s, when hundreds of mills closed and more than 200,000
workers nationwide left the payrolls.
   The industry was especially hurt by the 1981-82 recession and a
flood of imports. American steelmakers lost about $11.9 billion
from 1980 to 1986, the American Iron and Steel Institute estimates.
   The picture is brighter now. Steelmakers made $1 billion in
profits in 1987 and $2.3 billion in 1988, partly because they
shuttered inefficient mills, modernized others and won cost-saving
labor concessions. Import restraints and a cheaper dollar also
helped.
   The American steel industry takes an average of 5{ man-hours to
make a ton of steel, less time than any other producer in the world
and nearly half the time it took in 1980.
   ``The American steel industry is much more viable than it was
before,'' Barnett said. ``There certainly is still a need for the
industry, but the industry is going to continue to change.''
   The number of imports, in the form of raw steel and products
containing steel, has grown. About 26.4 million tons of steel were
imported in 1984, the all-time high.
   The weaker dollar and import quotas imposed in 1986 under
Voluntary Restraint Agreements negotiated by the Reagan
administration turned back some of the import tide. In 1989, 17.3
million tons were imported.
   ``The international competitiveness of the industry has much
improved,'' Bradford said. ``The weaker dollar was the biggest
factor.''
   Bradford said the relative value of international currencies,
more than anything else, will determine the future of American
steel this decade.
   ``It looks very ominous because the dollar has been strong. This
is an industry that needs a weak dollar because it does compete in
an international environment,'' he said. ``If that dollar keeps
soaring, these guys are in trouble.''
   Steel consumers want more sophisticated products tailor-made for
them, and steelmakers have responded by concentrating on narrower
product lines.
   Up to 25 percent of 1988 shipments were made by so-called
mini-mills, which use electric furnaces to make more specialized
products for specific regions or markets, Barnett said.
   Mini-mills have become more like large producers, expanding and
making products historically made by integrated makers. At the same
time, larger makers have become more like mini-mills, becoming more
entrepreneurial and in some cases closing coal mines or coke ovens
to focus on specific products at each plant.
   The Rev. William Hogan, author and director of the Industrial
Economics Research Institute at Fordham University in New York,
said American steelmakers are primed for a profitable future.
   ``They've cut the capacity and they've invested a lot of money,
something like $9 billion over the last five or six years, and they
plan to invest a very large amount in the next five years,'' he
said.
   He predicted modernization will be the main trend in
industrialized countries in the 1990s, while capacity will increase
in less developed nations.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Race Continues Between Population, Food Supply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some people think the Green Revolution has not
lived up to its promise and that the world's pantry will never be
able to keep up with growing populations. Others believe the race
can be won.
   The recent Earth Day festivities noted many of the ailments of
the planet, including pollution and depletion of natural resources.
   But no widely accepted answers were forthcoming on how well the
human race may be eating a few decades from now. Or whether, in
fact, millions may not eat.
   Lester R. Brown, head of Worldwatch Institute, says starvation
is a grim but effective natural solution to the fearful problem of
not having enough food for growing populations.
   In his annual book, ``State of the World'' for 1990, Brown said
that if we succeed in building a sustainable society, it will be
done by 2030, only 40 years from now. If not, he said,
environmental deterioration and economic decline will cause social
structures to disintegrate.
   Brown said world population should be no more than 8 billion if
a sustainable society is to be achieved by 2030. That is a billion
fewer than the United Nations projects as the actual population by
then.
   According to Brown, current estimates foresee populations
doubling or tripling in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and ``scores of
other countries where human numbers'' are already outpacing the
system.
   ``Either these societies will move quickly toward smaller
families, or rising death rates from hunger and malnutrition will
check population growth,'' he said.
   The humane path, Brown said, requires a dramatic drop in birth
rates. He said more countries will do as China has done and
Thailand is doing _ reducing population growth rates in half in a
matter of years.
   At the other end of the equation is food production, where the
biggest development has been the Green Revolution, the dramatic
crop increases that began with high-yielding wheat and rice
varieties developed in Mexico and Asia starting in the 1950s.
   New sources and techniques were also developed for many other
crops including corn, sorghum, field beans, peanuts, cassava and
potatoes. Use of fertilizer and other chemicals, irrigation, new
tillage practices and improved management also have been important
to the Green Revolution.
   Since the mid-1960s, according to a report in the current issue
of USDA's Farmline magazine, average world yields have risen 65
percent for grains and 24 percent for root and tuber crops.
   For countries swept up in the Green Revolution, the benefits
quickly moved beyond the farms to consumers in the form of
low-priced food. But the benefits were far from universal, says
Agriculture Department economist Mary Knudson.
   ``The Green Revolution has been criticized for encouraging
input-intensive agriculture (such as using more fertilizer and
weedkillers), neglecting locally important crops and bypassing
severely impoverished regions,'' Knudson said.
   ``In addition,'' she said, ``some critics argue that Green
Revolution-type technology is more accessible to successful, large
farmers who adopt these methods at a faster rate than smaller
farmers.''
   Some of the technology was not fitted for primitive areas where
research facilities and irrigation systems were lacking, Knudson
said. But some of these problems are being addressed.
   ``Improved hybrids of millet and sorghum were developed for the
semiarid areas of India during the 1960s and by the 1980s had
spread widely,'' she said. ``Some hybrids have recently been
adopted in Africa and have resulted in yield increases for those
two important staple crops.''
   Knudson said demand for U.S. hybrid seed corn has been growing
in South America, while research by several private and public
research centers has recently led to new, high-yielding rice suited
for temperate areas of China.
   Overall, she said, the older advances of the Green Revolution
and the emerging new biotechnologies hold out the promise of
sustaining agricultural growth in the world.
   In the Philippines, the International Rice Research Institute
says half a billion people, mostly in Asia, are fed by new rice
technology.
   Analysts Robert E. and Eleanor Huke reported that in a little
over 20 years after the introduction of modern rice varieties, the
rice areas of 11 Green Revolution countries showed yield increases
of 63 percent, compared with only 17 percent for the rest of the
world.
   The Hukes, in a new book to be released by the institute, said,
``One may debate the relationship between food production and
population growth, but not the reality that a larger population was
eating better in the later 1980s than in the mid-1960s.''

   ``A Blues for Buddha'' (RCA) _ The Silencers
   
   The Silencers hail from Scotland but their engaging, eclectic
sound spans the Atlantic Ocean, mixing highland bagpipes with
Memphis guitars, Motown rhythms and anthemic choruses that recall
the Irish band U2's better efforts.
   Lyricist-vocalist Jimmie O'Neill puts an original spin on themes
of love, faith and social injustice but it is the musical
arrangements that make ``A Blues for Buddha'' such a pleasure.
   One cut, ``Sacred Child,'' sets a cajun fiddle against a Bo
Diddley beat, then blends in those bagpipes while O'Neill raves on
in English, French and Spanish about the reckoning day a-coming,
all to delightful effect.
   This album was recorded in 1988 and released late last year.
Here's hoping for a follow-up in the near future.

   ``The Silos'' (RCA) _ The Silos
   
   The Silos prove on the first cut of their self-titled debut
album that they can rock in the best tradition of Southern
headbanger bands.
   But there is more than that to this Gainesville, Fla., quintet
and not all of it is as appealing as that first tune, ``Caroline.''
   Chief songwriter Walter Salas-Humara produces some pretty
acoustic guitar tunes and intriguing lyrics rich in visual details
that are sometimes soothing, sometimes disturbing.
   But fellow Silo Bob Rupe exerts a rougher, more back-country
influence that tends toward distortion guitars and repetitive,
raspy wailing.
   Their collaborations on four of the album's 12 songs are
occasionally exhilarating _ as in ``Caroline'' _ but frequently
annoying.
   Meanwhile, the bittersweet rocker ``I'm Over You,'' co-written
by Salas-Humara and non-Silo Robert Ray, is the most commercial
number in the collection and also one of the best.

   What's this? John Waters, the impresario of
bad taste, hooked up with the people who gave you ``Parenthood''?
   What's more, his new film, ``Cry Baby,'' is being released by a
mainstream company, Universal Pictures. Has the onetime king of
underground sleaze succumbed to the Establishment?
   ``I've always tried to make commercial movies,'' he explains
unapologetically. ``Think about it. `Pink Flamingos' (1972) cost
$10,000. All the hideousness I put in that movie was commercial.
Nobody heard of us before. All the people who left that movie said,
`Oh my God, you wouldn't believe what I just saw!'
   ``I always try to be commercial _ on my terms. It worked, too.
That movie's still playing. Two generations have been offended by
that movie. I'm proud of that. It's hard to do.''
   Talk about inflation. ``Cry Baby'' cost $8 million, minor by
Hollywood standards but not Waters'. The film is backed by
Universal and Imagine Films Entertainment, operated by Ron Howard
and Brian Grazer, makers of ``Splash'' and ``Parenthood.''
   ``They have been a wonderful support,'' said Waters. ``They
never said to me, `You can't do that.' They gave me the money to do
everything I wanted to do, hire `all the stars in heaven.'''
   Well, not quite. ``Cry Baby'' stars Johnny Depp, the teen rage
of TV's ``21 Jump Street,'' and Amy Locane as star-crossed lovers
in the 1950s. The cast ranges from Polly Bergen and Susan Tyrell to
Traci Lords and Iggy Pop with cameos by Willem Dafoe, Patty Hearst,
David (``Ozzie and Harriet'') Nelson and Troy Donahue. It's all set
to the beat of early rock 'n' roll.
   ``I wanted it to look like a '50s musical, like `The Girl Can't
Help It' or early Elvis,'' Waters said. ``Or like the spinoff,
lower versions of `The Wild One' or `Rebel Without a Cause.' I
liked those movies, but better, I liked the cheap imitations.''
   A movie nut all his life, Waters confessed his lifelong
ambition: ``I always wanted to be a villain in a Disney movie.''
With his thin, pallid face, razor-thin mustache and black suit, he
could easily have done so. Growing up in Baltimore, he gave puppet
shows from the age of 8 to 14, when he feared his playmates would
consider it ``uncool.''
   His first movie was shot in 8mm in 1964 when he was 19. The
title: ``Hag in a Black Leather Jacket.''
   ``It's in my closet, where it will stay,'' he said. ``It was
filmed on the roof of my parents' house. It was about a black man
marrying a white woman with a Ku Klux Klan member performing the
ceremony. The man took her away on the honeymoon in a garbage can.
It was very influenced by the 1960s Theater of the Absurd. It
played once in a beatnik coffee house, and that was it.''
   Waters continued making films with his Baltimore buddies until
the breakthrough with ``Mondo Trasho.''
   ``It was the story of a hit-run driver on one hideous day in her
life,'' he recounted. ``It starred Divine, and in the end Divine
died in a pig pen and the Virgin Mary appeared to her.
   ``In `Multiple Maniacs,' Divine was raped by a 15-foot broiled
lobster. `Pink Flamingos' was about a battle between the filthiest
people alive. `Female Trouble' was about a criminal who wanted to
be famous so badly that she got the electric chair; that was like
the Oscar in her chosen profession. `Desperate Living' was about
the worst town you could live in when you're so embarrassed about
your life you have to move there.
   ```Polyester' was a comedy about the hell of suburban life where
everything smells bad; it was released in `Odorama.' `Hairspray'
was a musical comedy about a teen dance show. `Cry Baby' is a
juvenile delinquent comedy.
   ``So you can see that my sense of humor has been the same from
the very beginning.''
   Despite the outrageousness of his themes, Waters claims, ``the
critics have been good to me since the very beginning. You get bad
press when you start believing the nice things that you all sign.
   ``Bad reviews? Rex Reed gave us the best: `Where do these people
come from? Where do they go when the sun goes down? Isn't there a
law or something?' That quote was our whole campaign in selling the
picture.''
   Although Waters' films are treasured at Saturday midnight
screenings, he insists that he enjoys a wide audience: ``After
`Hairspray' had been out, we found that 8- and 9-year-olds really
loved the films. That's an audience I had never tested, never even
thought of. They liked it on one level; they didn't see the parody
of it.
   ``When we tested `Cry Baby,' there were a lot of kids who said
they thought it was a really romantic movie. They can like it on a
another level. That's OK. It is romantic, it is sexy. All juvenile
delinquents were sexy, that's why they had 'em. The word itself is
sexy. We don't have juvenile delinquents anymore. We have
13-year-old mass murderers.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Mellencamp Lets Paintings Talk _ $15,000 a Pop</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Singer John Mellencamp's art is populated
with characters from America's heartland. But these days, those
characters are more likely to be found in oil paintings than on the
radio.
   For Mellencamp, painting has provided a respite from the
pressures of rock 'n' roll and the recent collapse of his second
marriage.
   His second exhibit of oil paintings opened April 12 at the
Churchman-Fehsenfeld Gallery of the Indianapolis Art League.
Mellencamp first displayed his work last year at an exhibit with
jazz artist Miles Davis in Los Angeles.
   The 29 portraits depict the singer-songwriter's family and
friends. The facial expressions created by his muted brush strokes
are always sad, and they convey the same disillusionment found in
his musical anthems about the nation's heartland and the farm
crisis.
   ``I think you can say much more in a painting than you can in a
stupid song,'' he said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine
last year.
   ``Some days I start at 7 o'clock in the morning, and I paint
until 5, eat dinner and come back and paint till midnight. I don't
have to see anybody. I don't have to talk to anybody. It's better
than sex for me.''
   However, Mellencamp's wealth hardly fits the stereotype of a
struggling artist. His albums have sold millions, he records in his
own studio and he could afford to spend much of the last year in an
art studio he had built next to his home near Bloomington.
   He and his wife, Vicky, are in the middle of a divorce. They are
the parents of Teddi Joe, 8, and Justice, 4, who currently are
living with their mother.
   Mellencamp's manager, Harry Sandler, said the singer did not
want to be interviewed about his venture into the art world. ``John
wants to let the paintings stand on their own,'' Sandler said. ``He
just chooses not to speak at this time.''
   Mellencamp has not hinted that his music career is over, but it
has certainly taken an extended vacation. His growing discontent
with pop stardom surfaced in his last album, ``Big Daddy.''
   ``Never wanted to be no pop singer, never wanted to write no pop
songs,'' goes the bitter refrain of the hit single, ``Pop Singer,''
which offers Mellencamp's cynical view of today's music scene.
   He refused to tour in support of ``Big Daddy,'' and his only
stage appearance in recent months came at the Farm Aid IV concert
in Indianapolis April 7. The rousing ovation he received and his
energetic three-song performance were far removed from the solitude
of a blank canvas.
   Mellencamp organized the first Farm Aid back in 1984 with Willie
Nelson as a benefit for struggling farmers.
   ``I think people my age need to start taking their position in
the community seriously, and start dealing with local problems
within the system,'' he said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``I don't mean standing in the back rows and throwing stuff,
any coward can do that. We tried that in the '60s and it didn't
work out too good. I mean to take affirmative action, and to make
positive steps to change in a country that needs to go through that
right now.''
   Those who have worked with Mellencamp say he is serious about
painting, and that it is not merely a hobby. Jan Royce traveled to
Mellencamp's studio several times last summer to help him learn oil
techniques.
   ``He's very bright, very eager to learn, very driven,'' said
Royce, a portrait painter from Indianapolis. ``He paints from the
heart, just as his music is from the heart.''
   Royce said the immediacy of creating a painting appeals to
Mellencamp's impatient nature.
   ``He works very fast and tries to capture what he's feeling
immediately,'' said Julia L. Muney, exhibits curator at the art
league.
   By displaying his paintings to the public and critics, Muney
said Mellencamp wanted ``some validation for himself. He wants the
public to confirm, `Am I going in the right direction?'''
   At least some buyers think so. Three of his self-portraits,
ranging in price from $2,000 to $6,000, were sold before the show
opened, Muney said.
   Reaction to the show was enthusiastic among 450 guests invited
to a pre-opening party attended by Mellencamp, Muney said.
   ``They liked the work a lot. They might have been skeptical, but
they are no longer,'' Muney said. ``I was expecting things to look
a little more folksy. I was surprised at the expertness of the
paint-handling.''
   In yet another paradox, Mellencamp chose to personally oversee
all aspects of the Indianapolis showing.
   Muney said he helped set up the exhibit, fussed over the titles
of each painting and wired the frames himself in preparation for
hanging.
   ``He'll deprecate his paintings. It's very strange because he's
serious about painting but after a while he won't be satisfied with
the results.
   ``We were looking at some of these paintings and he told me,
`This is crummy, but you can hang it anyway,''' Muney said,
gesturing toward the exhibit.
   Mellencamp insisted on removing two paintings from the exhibit
because he wasn't satisfied with them, Muney said.
   He may not want to discuss his paintings, but the prices on his
works speak volumes.
   His two least expensive works are a self-portrait of himself and
another titled ``Big J,'' showing his daughter, Justice, in a pink
dress. Both sell for $2,000. Three paintings are priced at $15,000.
They are among the largest works in the exhibit, measuring roughly
72 inches long by 48 inches wide.
   His first wife, Priscilla, is the subject of ``Cil,'' which
shows her wearing '50s-style glasses and large earrings.
   In ``The Beach or the Bar,'' said to be Mellencamp's favorite,
he portrays seven people gathered around an outdoor bar. At his
showing last fall in Los Angeles, the painting carried a $25,500
price tag. In Indianapolis, it's practically a steal at $12,000.
   ``Paintings cost more in L.A. He adjusted his prices down for
the Midwestern market,'' Muney said.
   Muney said Mellencamp asked her if his prices were too high.
``Given his name and what he's putting into them, frankly, I said
no,'' she said.
   But Muney admits few artists who have been painting for less
than two years can tag such elaborate prices on their works.
   ``Yes, they're paying for the name,'' she said of potential
Mellencamp collectors.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Writing the Best Record of the Year</HEAD>

   John Trudell can still remember the date (Jan.
14, 1979), the place (Vancouver, British Columbia) and what he was
doing (riding in a car) when he wrote his first lyrics.
   ``Suddenly, these lines came into my head, `Gently the rains of
purification wash my mind,''' recalled the 44-year-old Trudell, a
longtime Indian activist who has recorded several albums of his
poetry. ``Something told me to write them down and I've been
writing since then.
   ``I wrote a set of 20 lines. It was not something I expected.
Then I started writing and I started writing a lot. And I saw,
well, there's some reason I'm doing this and I'll see where the
writing takes me.''
   His writing found its way on tape with friend and guitarist
Jesse Ed Davis composing backing tracks for two albums. Unable to
sign with any record label, Trudell formed Peace Music and released
the songs on mail-order cassettes. In 1986, ``a.k.a. Grafitti Man''
wound up in the hands of Bob Dylan, who called it the best record
of the year.
   ``I think he was doing the Grateful Dead tour that year and he
played our tape at his concerts,'' Trudell recalled. ``The effect
wasn't monetary at that time. What it was was more recognition from
other artists.''
   So rock stars Jackson Browne, George Harrison and Bono became
fans, too, and Midnight Oil made Trudell the opening act for their
1988 tour. Trudell is a rock 'n' roll fan himself, paying tribute
to Elvis Presley in ``Baby Boom Che.''
   But while many of his co-stars are musicians who developed
politically, Trudell is an activist now giving live recitals.
   ``I knew how to handle the stage for myself, but I had never
worked it this way, with four or five other people. That's
something that I'm not trained for,'' Trudell said.
   ``I'm not familiar with the poets. I never really listened to
any poets. Their lines may have had great symbolic meanings, but
they were not real to my world. What was real to my world was
country music and rock 'n' roll music and blues.''
   Why he began writing is almost too painful to talk about, a time
he refers to as ``when things changed in my life.'' In 1979, after
Trudell led a march in Washington and spoke out against FBI policy
toward Indians, a mysterious fire at his Nevada home killed his
wife, his three children and his mother-in-law.
   ``I realized I needed to survive, but surviving isn't enough,''
said Trudell, who soon developed a ``compulsion'' to write.
``There's got to be something else that goes with it. Otherwise, a
lot of things lose their meaning and purpose. I was trying to
figure out how I was going to deal with that.''
   He was born in Omaha, Neb., in 1946, and lived on and off the
Santee Reservation until joining the Navy in 1963.
   ``I knew the realities in my reservation and life of the
reservations and I knew the reality of racism and a whole lot
things. But when I was in the military it showed me that there were
a lot of Indians around the world as far as America was
concerned,'' said Trudell, who served in Vietnam.
   ``I had the experiences of the military, and then I went to
college for a little while. Basically, college taught me the same
thing the Navy taught me. There are many realities here, and what
the controlling class taught me was you've got to submit to be
successful.''
   He became a leader of the Indian rights movement in the late
1960s, serving as chair of Indians of All Tribes during the
occupation of Alcatraz Island in 1969, and heading the American
Indian Movement in the '70s when protests took place at Mount
Rushmore, Washington and Wounded Knee.
   ``Graffiti Man'' includes political songs such as ``Rich Man's
War,'' and love songs such as ``Stardreamer Woman.'' Trudell speaks
of his writing as the next new wave in music, sounding like a true
punk rocker who's tired of the state of the art.
   ``Because the music industry, with all its high tech, has
basically gone as far as it could go, it's stagnant. It needs a new
infusion of human energy. I think spoken word can be that infusion
of human energy.
   ``People are used to langauge being spoken, used to being talked
to,'' he said. ``In our generation, all our poets got sucked up as
musicians and are identified as musicians and that put it out of
reach of your average person. Poets are within every person's
reach.''

   Judged by the numbers only, Seward Park High
School in Manhattan's squalid Lower East Side could be viewed as
just another monument to a nation's failure to educate its urban
poor, especially its immigrants.
   Fully one-fourth of Seward Park's incoming freshmen are already
17 years old. The school is so overcrowded that it is operating at
150 percent capacity. Nine out of 10 pupils live with parents who
don't speak English. Some three-quarters of the upperclassmen read
below grade level. The average Scholastic Aptitude Test score was
288 on the verbal section, on a scale of 200-800, and dozens live
in welfare hotels or homeless shelters. Less than 14 percent of the
school's seniors read at grade level.
   But there's another number that tells a more encouraging story
about Seward Park, a number that says there are students, plenty of
them, that beat the odds.
   A former New York Times reporter, Samuel Freedman, spent a year
at this old, overcrowded, money-starved school and found,
remarkably, that 92 percent of pupils who graduate go on to higher
education.
   Are we thus wrongly stereotyping urban schools as unqualified
failures? Freedman thinks we have overlooked the dedication of
teachers like Jessice Siegel, and students like See Wai Mui, a
Chinese immigrant, and Carlos Pimentals, from a backwater town in
the Dominican Republic, whose success in school takes a kind of
courage almost impossible to comprehend.
   Their stories are told in intricate and fascinating detail in
Freedman's important new book, ``Small Victories: The Real World of
a Teacher, Her Students &amp; Their High School'' (Harper &amp; Row,
$22.95).
   This is a humane, genuine and extraordinarily detailed portrait
of a ghetto high school, right down to the very bricks.
   In common with the best recent books and movies of this growing
genre _ the film ``Stand and Deliver,'' and the Tracy Kidder's
book, ``Among Schoolchildren'' _ ``Small Victories'' does not limit
itself to portraits of adults such as teachers or principals.
Refreshingly, the children are treated as main players on the
school stage _ no mean feat for an author, because youngsters thi
age, especially immigrants, are not the easiest interview subjects.
   In an interview, Freedman said he wanted to develop true
pictures of at least a few of the students in the school and
traveled halfway around the globe to do so. His research took him
to the People's Republic of China and the Dominican Republic, the
homelands of the majority of Seward Park's immigrant students.
   The picture that emerges is complicated, a blend of optimism and
despair. On the one hand, there is Jessica Siegel, a teacher and
dream-weaver, who cares so much about her profession it finally
consumes her.
   We feel cheered as she jawbones youngsters who never thought
they could go to college. She cajoles college admissions officers
into giving students with C-averages a chance. She drives her kids
hundreds of miles to vouch for them at college interviews.
   And we are inspired by the stories of many of her students. See
Wai, for example, came to New York in 1980, an immigrant from rural
China. By the time he entered Seward Park, his English was still
halting and the Chinatown that was his home left him prey to youth
gangs.
   Jessica spotted his potential and became his support, helping
him with his self-assurance and his English. See Wai, this kid who
defied the odds of his background, ends up at State University of
New York at New Paltz where he is now a sophomore.
   Yet such ``small victories'' are mingled with many daily defeats.
   As Freedman says, ``what I would hope people will take away from
this is that schools like Seward Park are designed to fail.''
   Meaning: neighborhood urban high schools, those designed to take
all comers, are being systematically starved of funds by unfair
formulas that send more money per pupil to the more selective city
high schools _ not to mention state funding formulas that generally
give suburban schools a big money edge over city schools.
   The successes, inspirational and noteworthy as they are, remain
exceptions.
   ``Small Victories'' ends on the bittersweet note that Siegel
decides that she's had it with teaching after nine years of long
days, late evenings and too many bureaucratic hassles. She's had it
with the teachers union, with students who refuse to be reached,
most of all with a life that doesn't leave room for finding a
husband or even a steady boyfriend.
   She decides to return to an earlier occupation, journalism.
   She'd thought often of quitting her $29,442 job. She'd thought
about how ``you grind yourself to dust'' and ``all you hear about
in return are lousy kids and lousy schools and lousy teachers. You
read an article in The New York Times about single women in which
somebody says it's tough to get dates if you're a teacher because
men are looking for professionals.''
   ``I understand I'm doing really good work,'' she says finally,
through tears. ``But I'm sacrificing my life.''

<TEXT>
   Twenty years ago, Skip Ewing saw Glen
Campbell perform on television. Something clicked.
   At the time Ewing was about to start school. Today, he's 26 and
one of the youngest country music performers signed to a recording
contract with a major label.
   ``I was about 4 when I got my first guitar,'' Ewing recalled in
an interview. ``I can't remember a time when I didn't play.
   ``I know I sang the theme to `Rawhide' and I watched `The Glen
Campbell Goodtime Hour.' I wanted to play just like Glen.''
   In the 1990s, Ewing is one of country music's fresh faces, just
as Campbell was in the late '60s.
   The handsome, well-spoken singer-songwriter is laying the
foundation for a solid career doing something he genuinely enjoys.
   His single, ``It's You Again,'' reached the Top 10 of the
country music popularity charts in February. ``Burnin' a Hole in My
Heart'' and ``The Gospel According to Luke'' were Top 10 hits last
year.
   Ewing has released two albums, ``Coast of Colorado'' and ``The
Will to Love.'' The latter has many cuts with little more than a
finger-picked acoustic guitar.
   He was born in Redlands, Calif., but lived throughout the
country because his father spent 11 years moving from city to city
in the Navy. Ewing worked at the Opryland USA theme park in
Nashville for 2{ seasons as a singer-dancer in a live production
tracing the history of country music.
   He also made a living as a songwriter and has written album cuts
recorded by Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson, George Strait, George
Jones, Conway Twitty, Ricky Van Shelton and others.
   Since launching his solo career, he has been the opening act at
country concerts with such headline performers as the Judds, Randy
Travis, Alabama and Reba McEntire.
   Ewing, who also plays the five-string banjo and mandolin,
understands that he's fortunate to have a recording contract at a
relatively youthful age. But he quickly adds that he worked
diligently for it.
   ``I was in town three years before it happened,'' he said. ``It
was a short time compared with some people, but I had been doing it
for a heck of a long time. I had been singing and writing songs and
traveling.
   ``I'm not a very patient person sometimes; I want things to
happen. That's one of the things I need to work on: accept things
as they are.
   ``I set awful big goals; I work hard at what I do,'' he said.
``I figured there are a lot of singers in town, a lot of
songwriters and a lot of guitar players, and if I can do all of
them well I have a chance.''
   His ballad-oriented music focuses on romance. In the album ``The
Will to Love,'' the song ``It's You Again'' is about the pain of
love. The cut ``Karen'' is about the disintegration of a
relationship. ``She's Makin' Plans'' is about devotion. ``Please
Don't Leave Me Now'' deals with family love.
   ``It seems like my voice is suited to ballads,'' Ewing said. ``I
like to sing emotional things. I feel like I'm sharing something
when I do that. I enjoy singing things that allow me to feel like
I'm saying something, that I'm expressing something. It's like
being an actor sometimes.''
   He has written all the songs he has recorded.
   ``Songwriting is very much a craft and an art. I don't just
settle for things. Sometimes it takes hours to find one line _ a
place where different emotions mix.
   ``I feel like I have a lot to offer. When I go and do a show,
it's not a job. It's something I love to do. The music I perform
and write is all a part of me. By sharing that with an audience, I
feel I'm sharing things important to me. I feel that what I share
with people is worthwhile and I'm not wasting somebody's time with
my music.''
   The song ``The Will to Love'' used an instrument rarely used in
country music: a cello. Ewing, who didn't want to use traditional
country instruments such as fiddles and steel guitars, said it
allowed him to be more intimate.
   On his next LP, he plans to use another instrument rarely heard
in country music _ a saxophone.
   ``I don't mind taking chances,'' Ewing said.
   Campbell, his old idol, surprised him recently after hearing
that Ewing was a longtime fan of his. ``He came by the studio
during my first album just to say `Hi!' That was a big deal to me
and still is.''

<HEAD>Endangered Birds Making a Comeback</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The peregrine falcon, once reduced to fewer than
100 pairs in the United States, is making a comeback, as hundreds
swoop off cliffs, ledges and, in many cases, skyscrapers.
   After 15 years and millions of dollars, conservationists say the
birds soon won't need special care, possibly by 1995. But they
worry Congress and others will decide that time is now.
   ``It's progressed marvelously. It's probably not true that the
bird is widely endangered now,'' said Jim Enderson, a Colorado
College biologist who heads a federal peregrine recovery team.
   ``It's been a model program nationally,'' said Brad Blodget,
Massachusetts' state ornithologist. ``It's a victory story.''
   Within five years, Enderson said, the government could probably
`downlist' the bird from endangered to threatened, or even take it
off the lists altogether.
   This is big news for the peregrine. Once totaling about 300
pairs in the East and many more in the West, the falcon population
was hard hit in the 1950s by DDT and other insecticides. By 1975,
there were no falcons known on the East Coast, and fewer than 100
pairs were known to exist in the entire continental United States.
   ``We were basically starting from zero,'' said Blodget.
   Groups such as the Boise, Idaho-based Peregrine Fund set about
reintroducing the falcon, importing hatchlings from Canada,
Scotland, Argentina and other countries.
   The federal government, which banned DDT for nearly all
purposes, earmarked about $300,000 a year for captive falcon
breeding. Some states even put check-off options on tax forms to
extend a portion of rebates to peregrine recovery.
   Nationally, the efforts have cost ``many millions of dollars,''
said Bill Burnham, president of the Peregrine Fund, which spends
about $800,000 a year on peregrine recovery.
   ``It's a lot cheaper to take care of the environment, rather
than trying to go in afterward and put them back after you lose
them,'' he said.
   Falcon recovery cost so much in part because it entails more
than just releasing an Argentinean bird in Montana. Mortality rates
are as high as 50 percent in the bird's first year, and remain at
about 15 percent subsequently, Burnham said.
   The Peregrine Fund will release, or ``hack,'' its 3,000th falcon
this year, Burnham said. In California, where more than 500 birds
were released in the 1980s, 90 pairs exist, up from eight pairs in
1975.
   Today, there are more than 540 falcon pairs in the United
States. Almost 100 pairs are in the Grand Canyon alone. In the
Northeast, at least 85 pairs have been counted, while about 17
pairs are known in the Midwest.
   ``As long as the pesticide situation does not change for the
worse, it's unlikely that this bird is going to be in trouble in
the foreseeable future,'' Enderson said.
   Other conservationists are more cautious.
   ``We're about two-thirds of the way there,'' Burnham said. ``As
far as the release of the peregrines go, there's probably a need
for another six to seven years.''
   The birds remain scarce in some places, such as Idaho, where
only three pairs are known. So, they say, they are keeping anxious
eyes on Washington, hoping Congress does not pull the plug too soon.
   ``One of the worst things you can do is put a lot of energy into
restoration, and then stop it,'' said Tom French, who heads the
Massachusetts endangered species program.
   As they are reintroduced to modern society, some peregrines are
showing a taste for urban life, where high-rise buildings resemble
high cliffs and rocky ledges.
   Nine pairs swoop and dive among the skyscrapers and sloping
bridges of New York City, while in Springfield, the peregrines
nesting on a 23-story building have become stars of a local cable
television show.
   But with the falcon's new surroundings have come modern hazards
such as high, thin wires, airplanes and plate-glass windows.
Conservationists say too many collisions with planes or
decapitations by wires could cripple breeding efforts.
   ``Last year one of the adult males flew over the airport and was
hit by an airplane and killed, right in the middle of breeding
season,'' said Pat Redig, who heads the midwest-based Raptor
Center. ``I've seen those happen with enough frequency to cause me
to be concerned about the fragility of our population.''

   Ponder the plight of the piping plover.
   This unassuming, sand-colored bird, already considered an
endangered species, is struggling to make its home in the urban
jungle.
   Most humans who visit Gateway National Recreation Area in the
borough of Queens don't even spot the plover, which nests, well
camouflaged, just an inlet away from Brighton Beach and Coney
Island, Brooklyn.
   But Meryl Golden, a researcher and National Park Service ranger
who's considered the pro among plover-watchers, perseveres. For
more than two years, she has strived to prevent the plover's
extinction.
   On April 24, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service presented a
Northeast Region Conservation Award to Gateway for its efforts to
protect the plover and other endangered birds: the least tern, the
common tern, and the black skimmer, which recently returned to
Gateway after a seven-year absence.
   The average piping plover is 7 inches long, with a black ring
around its neck and a black mark above its eyes. It makes a
two-toned whistle that ornithologists call ``peep, lull.''
   ``They're precious and comical to watch,'' said Golden. ``They
know who I am because I make eye contact with them. They're not
scared of me.''
   Thirty pairs nest on 2{ miles of beach, owned partly by the
National Park Service and partly by a private apartment complex.
   ``We believe it is the largest concentration of piping plover
anywhere,'' said Golden. ``Most beaches this size would have one or
two pair.''
   Perhaps 145 more pairs live on Long Island, although no one has
counted, Golden said. It's believed 875 pairs live on the Atlantic
Coast from North Carolina to Newfoundland, with a few more in the
Great Lakes and Great Plains regions.
   The birds enjoy flat, shell-covered, sparsely vegetated beaches.
When a plover lays its four eggs in a small depression in the sand,
the Park Service puts up ``symbolic fencing'': string, flags and
signs warning that an endangered species is nesting.
   The young walk around a few hours after they're hatched and can
fly in about 25 days.
   Instead of placing food in the chicks' mouths, parents lead them
to a feast of insects and marine worms. Unfortunately for the
plovers, ``one of their feeding areas is the water line, where most
of the human recreation is concentrated,'' said Golden.
   A mother plover, if disturbed, tries to convince the predator
that her wing is broken. ``She'll make a lot of noise and lead the
intruder away from where the young are; it's quite a convincing
display,'' said Paul Nickerson, chief of the endangered species
division of the Fish and Wildlife Service's northeast division in
Boston.
   Last year, Gateway began banning most recreation on the plovers'
beach during nesting season, March 15 through August. In 1988, six
chicks survived long enough to grow plumage and fly. In 1989, there
were 20, said Golden.
   But the plovers also face other dangers: Rangers and volunteers
have removed 3,000 pounds of oil from the beach after five spills
in the past few months.

   Frazier, the four-horned Navajo-Churro
ram and a flock of skinny turkeys look freaky, but Hans Peter
Jorgensen is serious when he says they can help save a world being
consumed by sameness.
   Risks of factory farming that produces cheap, easy-to-raise
``clone-like animals'' ultimately outweigh the benefits, said the
manager of the C.S. Foundation farm. ``It's a short-term gain for a
long-term, serious, serious loss.''
   There has been increasing interest in rare breeds. But Heidi
Johnson, a University of California-Davis agricultural extension
spokeswoman, chalked it up to a fad.
   Others disagree.
   ``When plants and animals are identical genetically, they have
the same strengths and weaknesses,'' said a paper produced by the
private, New York City-based C.S. Fund. ``When one variety suffers
destruction entire plant and animal populations can be
irretrievably lost; uniformity engenders vulnerability.''
   ``Between 1600 and 1900, experts estimate that one plant or
animal became extinct every four years,'' the report said. ``Today
it is estimated that at least one species is disappearing each
day.''
   ``Extinction is forever; you don't get them back,'' Jorgensen
said. ``Our position is: Don't throw the genes away, your
grandchildren might need them.''
   The foundation quoted recent studies that show less than 5
percent of the vegetable seed varieties available in this country
in 1903 are still around.
   Jorgensen compared the situation to the Irish Potato Famine.
About 750,000 people died from disease or starvation from 1845 to
1847, when the potato crop failed because of a plant blight
Jorgensen said might have been avoided if the Irish had relied on
more varieties.
   ``That was a crisis in genetic diversity,'' he said.
   The C.S. Foundation is financed by Maryanne Mott, a Montana
rancher, nature photographer and General Motors heiress. The
foundation has various causes its directors believe promote human
and cultural survival.
   About 15 acres of land in the sleepy town of Freestone,
population 54, about 65 miles north of San Francisco, were bought
by the fund in 1983 when it moved from nearby Santa Rosa.
Jorgensen, son of a dairy farmer and a former college art teacher,
cabinet maker and general contractor, was hired to run a project to
conserve rare, or minor, breeds.
   Rare breeds of cattle and horses are those with fewer than 200
annual registrations; rare sheep, goat and pig breeds have fewer
than 500. Minor breeds of cattle, sheep, goats and horses are those
with fewer than 1,000 annual registrations.
   C.S. hopes to carry its conservation message through education
and support for genetic diversity preservation. One goal is
``living history farms'' to keep rare breeds.
   The fund's first targets included the Navajo-Churro sheep.
Recently added to the list was the naturally mating Bronze turkey.
   The Churro sheep has a 450-year history in North America, dating
to when they were left behind by Spanish conquistadors who had
taken them on journeys as food. But the Navajos began using the
Churro _ with its long, coarse, double-coated fleece _ for
ceremonial rugs.
   ``That's why the old Navajo rugs would last 200 years,''
Jorgensen said.
   The Churro adapted to dramatic desert climate changes, altitude,
limited water resources and forage conditions, and Navajo flocks
soon numbered in the hundreds of thousands.
   But a federal livestock reduction program that Jorgensen charged
was aimed at humbling the American Indians and saving Lake Mead
from sheep-caused erosion led to their decimation.
   There are only about 500 Churros today; about 10 percent of
their rare gene pool is in Freestone's flock.
   At Utah State University, Churro Sheep Project spokeswoman
Kristy Selman cited the animal's ability to resist internal
parasites and contagious foot rot, problems traditionally expensive
for the sheep industry.
   Churro lambs sell for $250 to $1,000 and are of great value for
the Navajos' ``two gray hills'' carpets that use the soft but
strong black, brown and white yarns that require no dyeing, Selman
said.
   Many older Navajo weavers still cherish the Churro, which the
project supplies to reservations.
   ``It's been a long time since they've seen any of these,'' she
said. ``When they do, their whole faces light up. ... When they see
it, they want it and they want it now.''
   The success of the foundation's efforts on behalf of the turkey
remains to be seen. The turkey commonly raised by commercial
growers today has been bred for white meat, an absence of pin
feathers and breast muscles so large the poultry can't mate
naturally. Reproduction is handled by artificial insemination.
   ``I think we've taken a little step too far,'' said Jorgensen
while gazing at the gobbling flock at the ``Turkey Hilton.''

   The government's science programs, a source of
technological breakthroughs and national pride, are always
vulnerable to budget-cutters. This is the second in a series of
stories tracking the progress of one portion of this year's federal
budget _ science spending.

   Physicist Ellen Williams is spending
less time in her laboratory these days and more in her closet-sized
office, shuffling forms and grant applications.
   Her work on the properties of atoms in solid surfaces could
someday help advance computer technology. It already has won the
36-year-old University of Maryland researcher a 1990 award as the
nation's top young female physicist.
   But instead she spends long hours at her desk, under a
photograph of Nobel Prize-winner Madame Curie tacked to an
otherwise bare office wall. She makes telephone calls, writes
letters and files applications in a search for government and
corporate financing.
   One of the two federal research grants that have kept her in
business the last few years has expired, and the other is being
slashed nearly in half.
   ``I spend huge amounts of time worrying about money and not
about science, which is unproductive,'' said Williams, whose
federal support is shrinking from $100,000 to $37,500 annually.
``I'd say I have a year left of really good quality research, and
then a serious downward slope unless I find new funding.''
   Williams is not the only scientist grumbling that the
government's generosity is diminishing. From coast to coast and
from astronomy to zoology, scientists performing basic research _
which seeks knowledge regardless of its immediate application _ are
complaining that the government is leaving them and the country
short-changed.
   Of this year's $1.2 trillion federal budget, $64 billion will be
spent on scientific research and development.
   But only about one in six R&amp;D dollars _ $11.4 billion _ will go
to basic research, which White House science adviser D. Allan
Bromley calls ``the heart of our science and technology
enterprise.'' Two-thirds of the money is aimed at development,
mainly of weapons, while the rest is for applied research, devoted
to advances toward specific goals.
   The figures disturb advocates of basic research, who rely on
federal coffers for two of every three dollars they receive. The
competing fields of development and applied research get most of
their money from non-government sources such as corporations, which
tilt their scientific efforts heavily toward developing new
products.
   Basic researchers argue that there never has been a time when
breakthroughs were possible in a broader range of fields, from
robotics to human gene manipulation to global climate changes.
   ``We live in the midst of an explosion of technological and
theoretical opportunity,'' said Douglas E. Kelly, vice president of
the Association of American Medical Colleges. ``If we do not grasp
this opportunity, other nations stand ready to do so, probably at
our expense.''
   Scientists who perform basic research often poke around in
obscure areas _ such as Williams' study of the properties of atoms
_ that even when productive can take decades to bear fruit.
   But it is precisely that kind of work that has led to
unanticipated breakthroughs. Basic research in the 1940s into the
magnetic properties of atoms led to magnetic resonance imaging,
used today to examine human organs without surgery. The emerging
field of biotechnology owes its existence to scientists decades ago
who, with no practical goals in mind, began tinkering with living
cells.
   The White House and Congress, aware of such long-term payoffs,
have treated basic research relatively kindly in recent budgets.
   The government's annual $150 billion deficits have pinched all
federal spending, limiting many domestic programs to less than 5
percent growth per year. Yet federal basic research spending will
grow this year by 7 percent over 1989 levels. In his proposed 1991
budget, President Bush wants to boost basic research expenditures
to $12.4 billion, a 9 percent increase.
   Basic research advocates, however, say the dollars still fall
short.
   ``You really need to look at it not in terms of how we've done
in the past, but in terms of what the research opportunities are,''
said David Moore, executive secretary of the Ad Hoc Group fo
Medical Research Funding, a coalition of about 140 universities,
science societies and voluntary health organizations.
   When Moore and others visit Capitol Hill, they compete with
lobbyists for housing, veterans and other programs whose
beneficiaries far outnumber the nation's 218,000 scientists and
engineers.
   ``Science and technology in the budget are vulnerable and in
direct competition with programs with very active and very vocal
constituencies,'' White House adviser Bromley told a recent
Washington gathering of scientists.
   Once Congress chooses an amount to be spent on science,
lawmakers then decide how to distribute the money. Basic research
advocates cringe when they find themselves vying with projects such
as the $30 billion space station, which attract lots of political
support and large amounts of money.
   ``Mega-projects like the space station have a political life of
their own, driven first by the goal of the project and second by a
group of political actors who stand to benefit by the placement of
that project,'' said Kenneth Kay, who lobbies Congress for research
universities and corporations.
   ``There isn't that momentum for the $50,000 grant or the
microscope that some researcher needs,'' he said.
   Scientists performing basic research even compete with each
other.
   The National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of
Health _ the government's major agencies for financing
non-government scientists _ provided money for less than 30 percent
of the 47,000 grant proposals they received in 1989, an all-time
low percentage.

   Like most doctors, William Isaacs wants to
keep up with discoveries and refine his technique.
   But he lives in Canadian, a Panhandle town on the south bank of
the Canadian River, 100 miles northeast of Amarillo. The region's
dark red soil supports wheat farms and cattle ranches. Oil
pumpjacks dot the landscape.
   It's not the kind of place where doctors gather at conventions
to discuss the latest news in detecting breast cancer or treating
hypothermia.
   ``Out here in Canadian, it's such an obstacle to travel out and
get continuing education,'' Isaacs, a family practitioner, said.
``You have to leave your practice, hand it over to another doctor
and that kind of thing. It's almost too much trouble.''
   But a program sponsored by the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center
in Lubbock is using satellite television to bring continuing
education to doctors in Canadian and nine other rural West Texas
towns.
   Doctors in the program, called MEDNET, talk before cameras in a
studio at Texas Tech. The televised talks are transmitted by
satellite to rural hospitals at lunch time.
   ``It's a one-way video, but a two-way audio, so they can talk
back, make comments, ask questions,'' said Ted Hartman, MEDNET
director.
   ``It works really well,'' Carl Utterback, a family practitioner
in Seminole, said. ``I can see patients in the morning and I can
walk over to the hospital and have lunch and while I'm eating
lunch, I can absorb a few facts.''
   Hartman is optimistic the network, which began the educational
programs in December, will be expanded to the rest of the state.
   The satellite TV programs are only one facet of MEDNET, a
three-year pilot program funded by a $1.9 million grant from the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, $400,000 worth of
equipment from Texas Tech and a donation of $170,000 worth of
communications equipment from AT&amp;T.
   MEDNET also placed facsimile machines and computers in rural
hospitals so they could receive documents quickly from medical
school libraries. But doctors found they could send printouts of
ultrasound monitoring of fetuses to distant obstetricians. Two
rural women were taken to city hospitals to deliver babies because
of problems detected on the fetal printouts, Hartman said.
   A MEDNET computer network among rural hospitals allows them to
save money by buying supplies together in bulk. The computers also
allow rural hospitals to quickly send medical records to city
hospitals when patients are transferred.
   A two-way video service is planned to allow ``face-to-face''
talks between rural doctors and specialists at Tech's medical
school.
   ``The doctor in Alpine, for example, would present the patient
to the consultant in Odessa, and they would reach a diagnosis and
treatment,'' Hartman said.
   One aim of MEDNET, Hartman said, is to find out whether these
programs are affordable.
   ``This is necessary because if something isn't done to decrease
the isolation of these hospitals and physicians, they'll just close
and the doctors will go someplace else to practice,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tiny Particles Suspected of Carrying Pollutants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Particles called colloids apparently can
attach themselves to, or encase, bits of toxic elements and allow
them to flow for long distances in water, researchers said.
   A Los Alamos National Laboratory study suggests colloids could
confound conventional means of predicting how far pollutants travel
through ground water.
   That, in turn, means some hazards might have been underestimated.
   ``Colloids probably play a more important role than people
expected in the past,'' said Wilfred Polzer of the lab's earth and
environmental science division, one of the study's co-authors.
   The colloids, which might be composed of silica or various
minerals, are so small that a powerful microscope is needed to see
them and so light that they do not settle out of water.
   The study, published in the journal Environmental Science and
Technology, concerned two radioactive elements _ plutonium and
americium. But William Penrose, the study's lead author, said the
phenomenon potentially could affect an array of hazardous and
radioactive pollutants, pesticides and heavy metals.
   No one knows how widespread colloids are because nobody has
routinely looked for them, said Penrose. Their existence in ground
water was unknown until a few years ago, and there still is little
data, Penrose said.
   The study underscores the importance of determining whether
colloids are present at waste sites throughout the country, Penrose
and Polzer said.

   Chuck Henager came up with a way to make
buildings more resistant to earthquakes.
   Ray Moore invented a fluid that removes impurities from
industrial smokestack gases.
   Doug Elliott and Eddie Baker found a way to get more usable
material from low-grade crude oil, which could help reduce the
nation's reliance on foreign sources.
   They were among 344 people honored April 19 at an ``Invention
Convention'' that was part of Battelle Pacific Northwest
Laboratory's 25th anniversary celebration.
   The scientists, engineers and technicians are responsible for
369 inventions from the laboratory that have received patents in
the 25 years Battelle has provided research for the U.S. Department
of Energy's Hanford nuclear reservation.
   ``The whole basis is good people coming up with good ideas,''
said Don Williams, director of technology transfer for Battelle.
``We're trying to honor some of those people.''
   Henager created a concrete building joint that he said might
have prevented the fatal highway collapse during last fall's
earthquake if it had been used on San Francisco Bay area highways.
But the joints are still being tested by the American Concrete
Institute, he said.
   Moore, who is retired, has 20 patents. He said he is proudest of
a molten salt system that is the fluid used in smokestack scrubbers
to remove impurities before gases are released to the environment.
   The Invention Convention includes a booklet with four pages of
small-type descriptions of patents.
   There is not a better mousetrap among them. But there are
inventions to control the start-up of nuclear reactors, for more
energy-efficient methods of melting glass, and for a method to
detect plastic explosives in airline baggage.

<HEAD>Pricetag on Saks $1.5 Billion; New Owner is Hands-off Operator</HEAD>

   The international investment company buying Saks
Fifth Avenue plans to stick with the managers and the strategy that
have made the high-fashion retailer successful, officials said.
   Investcorp, a Middle East-based company, is paying $1.5 billion
to add the Saks name to a rack of upscale retailing investments
that include Tiffany jewelers and Gucci.
   As the rich price indicated, Saks had been one of the most
sought-after retailers on the market after its British parent, BAT
Industries PLC, put it up for sale last September.
   ``It does show that a profitable and prestigious U.S. retailer
can command top dollar despite all the retail properties on the
market'' and a sluggish retail environment, said Janet Mangano, an
analyst at Josephthal &amp; Co.
   The transaction announced Wednesday by Investcorp and BAT should
be completed within 10 weeks. Investcorp will assume certain of
Saks' liabilities under the agreement.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said Investcorp's proposal was
financially sound and contained a substantial amount of equity to
maintain Saks' reputation and support planned expansion of the
45-store chain.
   ``Saks will gain a new owner with a proven track record in
building luxury businesses, solid financial backing, and a
commitment to continuing the highly successful strategy established
by BAT for the company,'' Sheehy said.
   Arthur Martinez, senior vice president of BATUS Inc., BAT's U.S.
arm, said the acquisition will have nothing in common with the
heavily debt-dependent deals that caused problems for others, such
as Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retailers.
   ``This is not a traditional LBO (leveraged buyout) structure,''
Martinez said in an interview. ``Adequate capital is being put into
the business to manage it the way that is has been managed.''
   Store openings and renovations will be continued by the new
owners, Martinez said. Excluding a store in Texas that is being
closed, Saks has 45 stores in 20 states. The flagship store of the
New York-based chain is located in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue.
   Investcorp is widely believed to have immense financial clout.
It normally takes a laissez-faire approach to the companies in
which it holds stakes. For that reason, it is anticipated that
Saks' existing management, including Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Melvin Jacobs, will be retained.
   Jacobs has been credited with steering Saks on a successful
course. The retailer rang up sales of $1.3 billion last year and
earned $111 million before taxes and interest expenses.
   Paul Leblang, Saks senior vice president and director of
marketing, said Jacobs was unavailable to comment. Jacobs, in
partnership with a Japanese retailer, was one in a handful of
losing bidders.
   Investcorp was established in 1982 and operates from bases in
New York and London as well as well as cities in Switzerland and
Bahrain.
   It is incorporated in Bahrain and publicly traded there. A
controlling interest is owned by Investcorp's management committee
and it has about 11,000 shareholders in total, including wealthy
Middle Eastern, American, British and other European investors.
   Investcorp previously has bought into a wide range of retailers.
It acquired the jewelry chain Tiffany &amp; Co. from Avon Products Inc.
and took it public in 1987; it owns 50 percent of the Italian
luxury leather goods and fashion company Gucci; and has an interest
in Chaumet, France's largest retailer of prestige jewelry. It also
has stakes in ice cream chain Carvel Corp. plus some retailing and
non-retailing companies.
   Paul Soldatos, a member of Investcorp's management committee
that led the effort to buy Saks, said the company intends to meet
with Saks management as soon as possible. He said in an interview
that no discussions had taken place to date because the Jacobs
group was a competing bidder.
   ``It is our intent to maintain the continuity of management,''
Soldatos said. ``We rely on professional managment to guide the
business.''
   The acquisition of Saks will make Investcorp a powerful
behind-the-scenes force in a lucrative segment of the U.S.
retailing industry.
   ``They really have an eye on retailers that have a name,'' said
Janet Mangano, an analyst at Josephthal &amp; Co. ``What's very
significant about this is Investcorp automatically becomes a major
participant in U.S. specialty retailing.''
   BAT is selling its U.S. retailing businesses as part of a
restructuring to focus on its core tobacco and financial services
operations. The British conglomerate undertook the move to fend off
a hostile $22 billion takeover bid by a group led by Anglo-French
financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   The Goldsmith group dropped its bid earlier this week but BAT
promised to carry out its restructuring to enhance the company's
value to shareholders.
   On April 19, BAT announced the sale of Marshall Field &amp; Co., the
Chicago-based retailer, for $1.04 billion to Dayton Hudson Corp.

   Exxon Corp. claimed a welcome victory after
shareholders rejected measures urging it to do more to protect the
environment, but at elast one of the company's big investors was
dismayed by the vote.
   Shareholders at Wednesday's 3-hour, 40-minute annual meeting
turned down six resolutions asking Exxon to improve its
environmental performance in the wake of last year's Valdez oil
spill.
   Although the resolutions received more support than is usual for
shareholders' proposals, none got as much as 10 percent of the vote.
   Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said the results indicated ``support
of the management by large shareholders.''
   That support didn't include New York City's pension fund, which
own 6 million Exxon shares or less than 1 percent of the total
outstanding. The fund voted in favor of five of the six
environmental proposals and abstained from voting for the company's
nominees to the board of directors.
   The fund's trustee, Elizabeth Holtzman, ``is still not persuaded
that Exxon understands that its image and potential liability as a
polluter could seriously affect the value of its stock,'' said Ms.
Holtzman's spokeswoman, Nancy Young.
   Management had urged shareholders to vote against resolutions
seeking pledges by Exxon to reduce emissions of pollutants and
toxic waste, create a special environmental affairs committee on
its board of directors and follow the so-called Valdez Principles
for corporate environmental conduct.
   ``Liz is dismayed that a company in good conscience can oppose
reducing air pollution and toxic emissions,'' Ms. Young said.
   Brion Blackwelder, vice president of Friends of the Earth who
said he represented holders of 250,000 shares, also criticized
management's opposition to the proposals.
   ``You've chosen to take a hard line and miss each pitch
totally,'' Blackwelder told Rawl. ``You are out of touch with
reality. You're running a ship that you're not able to control. I
see no reason for you not to step down.''
   Rawl did not respond, but later said Exxon's support of American
Petroleum Institute environmental guidelines showed the company's
commitment.
   ``In addition to reaffirming our own commitment to safety and
environmental protection, Exxon has been an active participant in
the development of guiding principles for the petroleum and
chemical industries,' Rawl said.
   ``We're not taking a lackadaisical approach,'' he said. ``It's
damn important to us what happens'' to the environment.
   Rawl and President Lee R. Raymond presented an upbeat report on
Exxon's efforts to clean up Prince William Sound, where the Exxon
Valdez ran aground on March 24, 1989, spewing 11 million gallons of
crude in the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``The important point to make about the oil spill cleanup _
important to Exxon and you as shareholders and important to
Alaskans _ is that very substantial progress has already been
made,'' Raymond said.
   ``First by the massive effort that we mounted last year, and
later by the continued impact of bioremediation applications which
we made last year.''
   Under bioremediation, a oil-eating chemical is sprayed along the
ground.
   Raymond told reporters only about 60 miles of Alaskan shoreline
will be cleaned this year when full-scale efforts get under way in
a couple of weeks, compared to 1,100 last year.
   ``We really think that we'll be in very good shape by the end of
the summer,'' Rawl said.
   Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation,
interrupted management's review of 1989 to criticize an upbeat,
six-minute video showing Exxon's clean up efforts. He was booed
when he suggested the spill had harmed more than Alaska's
environment and even caused increases in child abuse and alcoholism.
   ``Listen to the people of Alaska whose lives have been destroyed
and you're putting the profits in your pockets,'' Hair said.
   Although the environmental proposals fell far short of adoption,
Federation spokeswoman Lisa Sylvester said the votes ``should be a
clear signal to Exxon that it's not going to get away with trying
to cover up the truth and it's going to have to change its policies
in order to survive in a changing world.''
   About 1,850 people attended Wednesday's meeting, with only about
20 protesters standing outside. Last year's meeting, held about a
month after the Valdez ran aground, drew about 1,700 shareholders
with about 250 raucous demonstrators outside.

<HEAD>Milken Helped Companies, Boesky Gave Bags of Cash, But Both Are
Felons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken appeared to have it all: the
brains, the power, the money, the achievements. Ivan Boesky was
made to seem he would have had nothing were it not for cheating.
   Both wound up in federal court admitting they were felons.
   ``I regard both as criminals, both as having engaged in conduct
which cannot be described as anything but arrogant disregard of the
law,'' former SEC Chairman David Ruder said. ``I wouldn't be sorry
for either of them.''
   Some saw a difference, though.
   ``The fact is, you can distinguish Milken from Boesky,''
securities lawyer Ira Lee Sorkin said. ``Milken did not (hand over)
paper bags stuffed with cash at 4 a.m. under the Brooklyn Bridge.''
   Milken the financier and Boesky the stock speculator have been
lumped together for more than three years. A 1987 Forbes magazine
drawing showed them with ear-to-ear grins after fattening up on a
pie of money.
   But while Boesky's wide legacy is that of swindler, Milken is
regarded by many as a brilliant innovator who created a new form of
financing that changed the way Wall Street and corporate America
operate, for better or worse.
   During his tearful guilty plea in U.S. District Court on
Tuesday, Milken sought to distance himself from his longtime
customer at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He said he and Boesky ``had
little in common.''
   Afterward, Milken's lawyer, Arthur Liman, said Milken hoped
history would recount not just the lawbreaking in several stock and
bond transactions but his junk bond innovations that helped dozens
of small companies.
   ``He's a genius but he broke the law,'' said former stockbroker
Boyd Jefferies, who admitted to illegal dealings with Boesky,
cooperated with investigators and was placed on probation.
   ``He has to suffer the consequences just like myself,''
Jefferies said Wednesday from his Aspen, Colo., home. ``I
contributed a lot to the securities industry, but I stepped over
the line and I had to pay.''
   Tales abounded of Boesky's shady business dealings, such as
swapping satchels of money with investment banker Martin Siegel for
illegal inside information about takeover stocks he was trading.
   Boesky, now 53, rode in limousines, wore expensive black suits,
beat his own drum in newspaper interviews, dined at the Harvard
Club _ he never finished college but got a degree from Detroit Law
School _ and was obsessed with money.
   Boesky once asked an interviewer to imagine a Jacob's ladder
made of $500 million in silver dollars. ``Imagine,'' he was quoted
as saying, ``wouldn't that be an aphrodisiac experience, climbing
to the top of such a ladder?''
   Milken, 43, wears a sharply different public face. He dresses in
conservatively tailored blue suits and simple ties. By the
standards of a billionaire, the Encino, Calif., home where he lives
with his wife, Lori, and three children is modest.
   When Milken talks to reporters _ always under carefully
controlled conditions _ it is about helping others. He focuses on
the high-yield bond market's capital-raising attributes and on his
favorite charities. Asked about money, he often says that ``wealth
is a byproduct.''
   It was a byproduct he enjoyed far more than Boesky. Milken
earned $550 million in 1987 alone. And his reputation as a
sometimes ruthless controller who worked 18-hour days is hardly
flattering.
   Milken's detractors say junk bonds created a debt binge that has
left many companies on the brink of failure. They also say
junk-bond-financed hostile takeovers realigned the corporate power
structure against managers in favor of noveau riche raiders.
   Four of the six criminal counts to which Milken pleaded guilty
this week involved dealings with Boesky. The government's original
98-count indictment and the SEC's complaints against both men
included allegations of more extensive illegal behavior.
   As head of Drexel's powerful high-yield bond department, Milken
did business with Boesky beginning in 1983, raising $100 million
for a Boesky-controlled hotel group. Drexel raised about $750
million for Boesky's arbitrage partnerships in the next three years.
   ``In many ways the Boeskys of this world are (Milken's)
creation,'' said playwright Jerry Sterner, a one-time businessman
who wrote the off-Broadway hit ``Other People's Money'' about a
hostile takeover. ``It seemed to me he was the master puppeteer.
Boesky was one of many puppets he had on his string.''
   Until pleading guilty to six criminal counts and agreeing to pay
$600 million, Milken asserted his innocence. In court, he broke
down in tears while reading a statement about his ordeal. His
family and dozens of friends watched in shocked disbelief.
   Boesky made no such statement when he pleaded guilty three years
ago to one felony and agreed to pay $100 million in penalties.
There was no horde of supporters, no business associates ready to
extol his virtues.
   All of Wall Street's convicted professionals, Jefferies said,
``come in somewhere above that low point on a scale of one to 100.
Ivan was minus 100 on the scale.''
   ``Michael definitely had many, many pluses,'' he said, ``and he
had some minuses.''

   It started out as a hearing on penny stock
reform legislation, changed into a report on the Michael Milken
settlement and then into a dressing down of the head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   When it was over Wednesday, officials said the chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee may call the fallen financier
Milken and ex-speculator Ivan Boesky to testify before Congress.
   Milken, who pleaded guilty to six felonies on Tuesday, ``might
have things we'd be interested in hearing,'' said Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., whose committee oversees the SEC.
   A senior congressional aide who asked not to be identified said
Dingell also may seek testimony from Boesky, who led prosecutors to
Milken and was linked to the former junk bond king in a number of
illegal deals.
   The disclosures came after a hearing of the committee's finance
subcommittee, which is considering legislation to give the SEC more
clout in fighting fraud in the low-cost, high-risk penny stock
market.
   But SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden spent much of his time
touting the settlement the SEC and Justice Department reached with
Milken.
   The former high-yield wizard of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
ended a three-year struggle with the government by pleading guilty
to six securities and tax violations and agreeing to pay $600
million in penalties. He faces up to 28 years in prison at
sentencing Oct. 1.
   Boesky settled criminal and civil charges by pleading guilty to
one felony count and paying $100 million. He was freed earlier this
month after completing two years of a three-year prison term.
   Dingell said he may call Milken to testify about purported
violations involving junk bond offerings handled by Drexel.
   ``We think there may have been as many as 2,500 (violations) and
that may be on the low side by an order of 10,'' Dingell told
reporters after peppering Breeden with questions about the Milken
settlement during a hearing on penny-stock reform legislation.
   At issue is the legality of trading accounts owned by limited
partnerships _ controlled largely by Drexel employees _ that bought
significant percentages of hot junk bond issues before they were
made available to the general public.
   Critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at
the expense of Drexel customers, but the transactions' legality has
never been resolved. Drexel halted the practice after it came to
light.
   The existence of the limited partnerships was disclosed two
years ago in documents and testimony presented to the oversight
subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Milken was called to testify at that time, but invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   The documents and testimony were sent to the SEC and Justice
Department but ``there has regrettably been no satisfactory
response,'' Dingell said.
   Dingell complained about SEC inaction on the matter to Breeden,
although he conceded the events occurred before Breeden took office
last October.
   ``It is ... over a year since those matters were referred to the
commission. Nothing was done,'' Dingell said. ``Can you tell us why
nothing was done? Was it because of budgetary matters or
indifference or what?''
   ``I can't even tell if nothing was done,'' Breeden said, adding
that he would look into it.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden told a House panel he supports efforts to curb
penny stock fraud but fears legislation being considered may cause
as many problems as it solves.
   Penny stocks are low-cost securities, usually trading for less
than $3 a share, that are typically used to raise capital for new
or small companies. They are not listed on stock exchanges and thus
reliable, up-to-the-minute information about them is hard to obtain.
   That makes penny stocks prone to fraud by unscrupulous traders
and promoters.
   The Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, introduced earlier this
month by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., would implement several
reforms. They include beefing up the SEC's power to bar crooked
promoters and consultants from pushing highly speculative stocks on
unsophisticated investors and requiring that all penny stocks trade
through an automated stock quote system.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee's finance subcommittee, which
Markey chairs, heard testimony on the bill Wednesday. Supporters of
all or most of the bill's provisions included U.S. Attorney Dee
Benson of Utah and Susan E. Bryant, administrator of the Oklahoma
Securities Department and president of the North American
Securities Administrators Association, a state-level regulators
group.
   But Breeden said that while the SEC supports the proposed
legislation's goals, ``there are a number of specific areas where
the bill as presently drafted create some problems we think it
would be better to avoid.''
   Unscrupulous penny stock brokers can evade SEC banishment from
the securities business by calling themselves promoters or
consultants, which the SEC has no authority to regulate.
   To close that loophole, the bill would redefine who is a person
``associated with a broker or dealer.'' Breeden said the
legislative language was too broad, however, and would force
broker-dealers to register all their officers and other employees _
and maybe even their accountants and lawyers.
   That point was supported by another witness, John F. Guion,
president of the Associated of Publicly Traded Companies, a group
of 800 concerns whose stock is traded over-the-counter.
   Breeden also criticized a provision to bar so-called ``blank
check'' stock issues, which seek investors' money without a
specific business plan or purpose, and ``blind pool'' penny stocks,
which seek mergers and acquisitions in a specific industry or line
of business.
   ``What appears to be a simple solution could have costly and
undesirable side effects,'' Breeden said, noting that the provision
could impose added responsibilities on the SEC without additional
resources.
   He also said the provision could inhibit legitimate venture
capital efforts in the real estate, oil and gas exploration and
equipment leasing industries.
   Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo, R-N.J., the subcommittee's ranking
Republican and a co-sponsor of the bill, expressed concerns about
weakening the legislation.
   ``We want a strong bill. We want this practice to a halt,'' said
Rinaldo, adding, ``and I don't think we're going to be able to do
it with a weakened piece of legislation.''
   Breeden spent much of his testimony lobbying for passage of the
Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act, a market reform bill
pending before the full House. It would give the SEC powers it
never had before including the authority to impose civil fines of
up to $500,000 and halt alleged illegal activity without first
obtaining a court order.
   That bill ``would enhance the commission's enforcement power in
all types of cases, and they would prove especially valuable in
combating penny stock fraud,'' said Breeden.

<HEAD>Company Agrees to French Merger in Takeover Fight With British</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the spirit of 1776, a Massachusetts
company threatened with invasion by a British conglomerate has
turned to the French for help.
   Norton Co. announced Wednesday it had agreed to be bought by
Compagnie Saint-Gobain, one of the world's leading glass makers,
for $1.8 billion or $90 a share.
   The move averted a potentially debilitating siege by Britain's
BTR PLC, which earlier made a hostile takeover bid of $1.6 billion
or $75 a share.
   ``Everybody's happy,'' said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with the
brokerage PaineWebber Group Inc. ``An ongoing fight would be
detrimental. They've put together an excellent deal.''
   Norton had fought bitterly since BTR launched its bid last month
but in the end conceded it couldn't stand alone.
   ``Given the increasing risk of the worst alternative for all
constituencies _ fighting a war of attrition only to be bought in
the end by BTR for an inadequate price with no protection for
employees and the Worcester community _ we have concluded that a
negotiated merger ... is the best alternative,'' Chairman John S.
Nelson said in a statement.
   News of the agreement sent Norton's stock sharply higher on the
New York Stock Exchange. The stock rose $13.37{ a share to $88.62{
Wednesday and was the most active issue on the exchange with more
than 4.5 million shares traded.
   Under the deal, Norton will continue to operate under its name
and keep its headquarters and principal manufacturing operations in
Worcester. The companies said employee policies and benefits would
continue at present levels and Norton would retain a separate board
of directors.
   Those were key factors for Norton. The company had claimed a BTR
takeover could have led to its dismemberment despite BTR's denials.
   Saint-Gobain Chairman Jean-Louis Beffa said he agreed to the
deal to expand his company's U.S. interests and because ``we did
not want to see it (Norton) dismembered or subjected to debt that
would interfere with its strategic plans.''
   BTR said it would withdraw its attempt to put three people on
Norton's board of directors but is extending its offer to May 3.
The extension is in case the deal with Saint-Gobain merger goes
sour, said a BTR spokesman in New York City, who refused to give
his name.
   ``Essentially, we're pleased by it,'' the spokesman said of the
higher bid. ``We're 4.9 percent shareholders of Norton.''
   Norton employees staged an impromptu rally in the company
parking lot to celebrate their apparent escape from BTR, which they
were convinced would have decimated the company.
   ``The mood is great,'' said Tom Morrison, organizer of a group
formed by employees to fight BTR's bid. Employees had held rallies,
published a daily newsletter and lobbied for legislation to make a
BTR takeover more difficult.
   ``We're really proud of what we did. Things are really good.
Hopefully, BTR's going away and this company we're setting up with
seems to be a very good move,'' he said.
   Norton spokeswoman Andrea Priest said the merger appeared to be
the best way out of the takeover battle.
   ``Saint-Gobain is a real strategic partner for Norton. Aside
from the fact that it's offered a premium price for the company, it
understands Norton's businesses, it believes in research and
development,'' she said.
   Norton is a leading manufacturer of abrasives and engineering
materials, including advanced ceramics, performance plastics and
chemical process products. It had 1989 sales of about $1.5 billion,
employs 16,000 people and operates 113 plants in the U.S. and 25
other countries.
   Saint-Gobain produces a variety of flat glass, fiber glass,
piping, paper and wood products. It has annual sales of more than
$11 billion, employs 88,000 people and operates 350 plants.
   ``I think that it's an ideal situation for Norton and
Saint-Gobain,'' said Alvin Donius, an analyst with New York-based
Altman, Brenner Wasserman. ``There is great synergy _ technology,
research and development, manufacturing _ the whole nine yards.''
   The merger requires the tender of at least two-thirds of
Norton's common shares before April 30.
   The announcement came a day after a federal judge ordered Norton
to reveal the amount of an offer the company said it received last
week. Norton told the Securities and Exchange Commission last
Friday that a third party was interested in buying Norton for more
money than BTR.

<TEXT>
   Few people could have been more shocked than
John O'Connor when the St. Louis Sun, the morning tabloid that made
its debut just seven months ago, went out of business.
   O'Connor joined the Sun's staff a little over a week ago _ just
long enough to rent an apartment and learn his way to work _ and
was out on assignment when the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Ralph
Ingersoll II, announced the paper's closure in the newsroom
Wednesday.
   ``I walked into a bar and I saw Ralph Ingersoll on TV,''
O'Connor said, standing outside his newspaper's downtown offices.
``I said, `That looks like my boss, I'm from the Sun.' They said,
`That is your boss, you're out of a job.'''
   O'Connor, who came to the Sun from the Bloomington (Ill.)
Pantagraph, was one of 194 full-time employees who were trying to
recover from the shock that the Sun is no more.
   Ingersoll, who is chairman and chief executive officer of
Ingersoll Publications Co. and has an interest in four other
newspaper holding companies, said his new tabloid couldn't generate
enough single-copy sales.
   ``It had nothing to do with money. It had to do, and you'll have
to take me at my word for it, with single-copy sales '' said
Ingersoll, who had moved to St. Louis to personally direct the rise
of the new paper.
   Ingersoll said the Sun had to sell most of its 100,000
newspapers via vending boxes or from racks in convenience stores
and on street corners in order to survive.
   Instead, it ended up with home-delivery sales outnumbering
single-copy sales two-to-one. That cost the paper, which spent in
excess of $25 million to start up, an unexpected $5 million.
   Home delivery costs are higher because of the expenses of
billing customers and hiring delivery people.
   Ingersoll decided Sunday night to stop the presses and make
Wednesday's newspaper, with the large, front-page headline
``Deathly Quiet,'' the Sun's final edition.
   After seven months and 213 editions, the newspaper's sudden
death surprised everyone.
   ``They read the handwriting on the wall .... The weather was
good, the Cardinals were playing, the Blues were playing and people
still weren't buying the paper. You don't have to be a brain
surgeon to figure it out,'' said Kevin Horrigan, a popular
columnist who jumped ship from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to join
the Sun.
   In Horrigan's old newsroom, Post-Dispatch Editor William Woo
said he was sorry about the demise of the Sun.
   ``The Sun undertook a difficult mission and made a valiant
effort, which fell short,'' Woo said.
   With a circulation of about 100,000, the Sun never threatened
the Post-Dispatch's huge circulation of 375,000 daily and 565,000
on Sunday.
   But it did manage to generate a fair share of controversy in
this conservative Midwestern city.
   The Sun was criticized by some as sensationalizing stories for
its coverage of a politician involved in a sexual assault and of
the five-year anniversary of an accident in which a man was nearly
sawed in two.
   The newspaper also was chided for running photos of new women's
swimsuits and lingerie.
   But the Sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing St. Louis'
major air carrier, Trans World Airlines.
   Ingersoll said he didn't know how much money he had lost on the
Sun. He said the decision to close had nothing to do with long-term
debt problems at another of his newspaper companies.
   ``They have nothing to do with each other. They are different
companies,'' he said.
   On Friday, an offer by Ingersoll to buy back much of the $240
million of junk bonds issued by his Community Newspapers, Inc.
failed to attract a single bondholder. If he can't arrange a
buyback, the interest rate on some of the bonds might have to be
reset at an exorbitant level of more than 26 percent in June.
   Ingersoll extended the offer until May 4 and Wednesday said he
was considering raising his offer.
   The St. Louis Sun was owned by Ingersoll Newspapers, Inc., which
also owns 77 other newspapers in seven states. Ingersoll also has a
stake in New Haven Newspapers, Inc., which owns the New Haven
Register; Ingersoll Publications Ltd., which owns 29 newspapers in
Great Britain; and Ingersoll Publications Co., which is a newspaper
management group.

<HEAD>Camaro, Firebird Production Moving to Canada from California</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp.'s announcement that it will
move production of two sports cars to Canada from California is
antagonizing labor relations as contract negotiations draw near, a
union official says.
   GM of Canada announced Wednesday that production of the new
generation of the Chevrolet Camaro and the Pontiac Firebird, or
F-cars, would begin in Ste. Therese, Quebec, in 1992 for the 1993
model year. The cars now are made at GM's Van Nuys, Calif., plant.
   ``Since General Motors clearly has sufficient capacity to build
the F-car replacement in the United States we see no reason why it
should not be built here,'' said Stephen Yokich, vice president of
the United Auto Workers in charge of the union's GM Department.
   ``These annoncements are doing nothing to create a favorable
environment for the difficult negotiating task we face later this
year,'' he said.
   The UAW and the nation's Big Three automakers begin bargaining
in July on contracts to succeed agreements that expire Sept. 14.
   Workers at the Ste. Therese plant are represented by the
Canadian Auto Workers union. CAW President Bob White said the
announcement ``was hopefully a measure of security for the future.''
   The Ste. Therese plant now makes the Chevrolet Celebrity station
wagon and the Oldsmobile Ciera, both A-cars. GM of Canada spokesan
D. Stewart Low said Wednesday the new Camaro and Firebird would be
the only cars produced at the plant.
   ``There's no question that the A-car will leave Ste. Therese,''
he said. In addition to Ste. Therese, GM now makes Celebrity wagons
and Cieras at its plant in Oklahoma City.
   Sales of Camaros and Firebirds, first introduced in 1967, have
been suffering this year like those of other GM cars. Through April
20, Camaro sales were down 35 percent compared with last year, and
Firebird sales were off 39.6 percent.
   The precise timing of the production move hasn't been set, Low
said, but, ``It looks like we're on target for a '93 (model year)
launch.''
   He also said it was too early to tell if the change would alter
the work force at the plant outside Montreal.
   There are about 3,500 workers at the Ste. Therese plant and
about 3,800 at the Van Nuys factory.
   GM plans to change the Van Nuys plant to a ``flex plant,'' or
one that can make a variety of vehicles on the same assembly line.
Such plants are used by Japanese automakers, but the move would be
a significant break from GM's past manufacturing practices.
   ``It would be a facility capable of assembling a number of
various models that would allow us to respond more quickly to the
Western market,'' GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner said in Detroit. She
declined to say what kind of vehicles may be built there or how
long it would take to convert the plant.
   ``It would be flexible from the standpoint of being able to
build a new van they are bringing out as well as some cars,'' Henry
Gonzalez, United Auto Workers union Region 6 assistant director,
said from Southern California.
   It wasn't known what kind of cars would be made at the flex
plant. Sports cars and convertibles are extremely popular in the
West, along with sport-utility vehicles and vans.
   Tanner said final approval for the flex plant hasn't been
granted, but said backers of the proposal were encouraged.

   The absence of a subcompact in Chrysler Corp.'s
lineup and a retreat from large-scale fleet business are damaging
the company's car sales, and relief won't arrive before 1992,
analysts say.
   Sales at the nation's No. 3 automaker have fallen more than
those for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the top two
makers.
   Chairman Lee Iacocca acknowledged Wednesday that Chrysler's
absence in the subcompact market is hurting.
   Chrysler stopped making its Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon
subcompacts Feb. 2 when it closed a plant in Detroit. It said sales
of the so-called L-cars were too slow. They will be replaced by
stripped-down versions of the Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow,
code-named P-cars.
   ``We're taking a beating,'' Iacocca said in Chicago, the fifth
stop of a six-city road show to promote the company's vehicles.
   ``We dropped the L-car. We don't have the lower-priced P-car
ready for mass production for lots of reasons. We got out of the
rental car business. There wasn't any money in it.''
   Auto analyst David Healy of Barclays-BZW in New York agreed the
absence of a subcompact is hurting sales, but suggested less of an
impact on the bottom line.
   ``Part of it is they've discontinued Omni-Horizon so that takes
units out but doesn't take profits out,'' he said. Inexpensive cars
carry a smaller profit margin than expensive vehicles.
   Auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. in
New York said sales are depressed even without subcompacts.
   ``There are two things operating in Chrysler car sales,'' she
said. ``They dropped the Omni-Horizon. The other is that Iacocca
has said that with the fleet business having gotten so ferocious,
that Chrysler has pulled back from that.''
   Healy estimated that 15 percent to 20 percent of the industry's
sales volume so far this year has been in fleet sales to rental car
companies, police agencies, taxi companies and large corporations.
   All of that has dented the company's car sales figures. But
sales of light trucks, which comprise about 55 percent of
Chrysler's U.S. sales, remain at fairly strong levels given the
current general sales slump.
   Through April 20 of this year, Chrysler's North American-made
trucks were selling at a rate 5 percent slower than during the same
time last year. Sales of trucks made by Ford were down 4.5 percent
while GM's truck sales were up 2.9 percent.
   Sales of Chrysler's North American-made cars were down 16.7
percent, while sale of Ford cars were off 11.4 percent and GM cars
were down 5.7 percent.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars carrying Japanese companies' nameplates
were up 20.2 percent.
   In his road show and on television advertisements, Iacocca has
said Chrysler deserves a break. He contends Chrysler's quality is
at least as good as that of the Japanese cars, and that Americans
should head to dealerships to find out.
   But dealers aren't seeing big increases in customers in their
showrooms.
   ``We had a good month last month, but it's a little slow now,''
John Johnson, sales manager and co-owner of Dodge of Kingfisher in
Kingfisher, Okla., said Wednesday. ``For four or five years, it's
been hard to put two good months together.''
   There doesn't appear to be anything on the near horizon to
reverse the car sales trend, analysts say.
   Chrysler plans to introduce a new line of cars in late 1992 for
the 1993 model year developed from a project code named LH-LX.
   ``They need something really distinctive and I think LH will
really do it for them,'' Sudol said.
   ``I don't think there is a whole lot coming between now and
then,'' Healy said. ``They do have the restyled minivans coming
this fall, but that's the main thing.''

<HEAD>Gannett Foundation to Sell Its 10 Percent Share of Gannett Co.
Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees of the Gannett Foundation, the
largest shareholder in Gannett Co. Inc., said tax considerations
will cause it to sell its 10 percent stake in the company.
   Foundation Chairman Allen H. Neuharth and President and CEO
Charles L. Overby announced the plan to sell the stock holding in a
joint statement at the American Newspaper Publisher Association
meeting Wednesday.
   ``IRS regulations, which require foundations to pay out an
amount equal to 5 percent of their assets annually, force us to
seek higher income than common stock dividends pay,'' the statement
said.
   ``With increased income, we will expand the work of the USA's
largest information-based foundation, especially broadening
programs in education, literacy and first amendment freedoms.''
   The release said the foundation would prefer to place the stock
in the hands of the Gannett Co. or an employee-stock owner plan if
possible.
   ``But our financial advisers will explore all alternatives,'' it
said.
   Gannett Co. issued a statement saying its board previously
announced a stock repurchase program to acquire up to 7,500,000
shares of Gannett common stock.
   ``From time to time, the company has expressed its continuing
interest in buying back its stock, subject to market price,'' the
statement said.
   ``Gannett has not yet decided whether it will be in a position
to be a purchaser of the stock that may be sold by the foundation.''
   To date, Gannett said it has repurchased 2,957,000 shares of
stock.
   The Arlington, Va.-based foundation held its annual meeting in
connection with the ANPA convention.

   Police moved in after strikers clashed with Eastern
Airlines workers during a boisterous union farewell to ousted boss
Frank Lorenzo. One union member was injured.
   Scuffles broke out when Eastern workers crossed the Machinists
picket lines during a 3 p.m. shift change Wednesday. Hundreds of
union members were marching outside Eastern corporate headquarters,
as they have for more than 13 months.
   Dozens of Metro-Dade County and Miami Springs police officers
waded into the crowd. One union member, his head bleeding after
apparently being hit by a nightstick, was taken away for treatment
in a Metro rescue vehicle.
   ``All he did was call a scab what he is _ a scab,'' said Charles
E. Bryan, president of Machinists District 100. He said two police
officers on horseback clubbed the unidentified union member.
   ``That's unconscionable,'' Bryan said.
   Metro-Dade police spokeswoman Lizette Williams said two union
members were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Of the
wounded striker, she said there was ``some controversy about how he
was injured, whether the gentleman fell or what happened.''
   She estimated the crowd of demonstrators at 450 people.
   Martin Shugrue, former executive at Pan American and Continental
Airlines, was appointed by a federal judge as a trustee to run
Eastern, still owned by the Lorenzo-headed Texas Air Corp.
   Striking Eastern Machinists, who walked out March 4, 1989, were
joined in their rally by some 200 members of the union's
international who were meeting at Hollywood's Diplomat Hotel.
   ``It's kind of a bittersweet type of thing,'' said George
Kourpias, the union's international president. ``It's bitter
because it took 13 months but it's sweet because Lorenzo is out.''
   Kourpias said Shugrue's pledge to bring better labor relations
to Eastern was encouraging, and that Shugrue has a reputation for
fairness.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell had no comment about the rally.

   How will newspapers survive in a world where
fewer and fewer people read them?
   Will there be enough literate people to care?
   A fittingly upbeat Walt Disney Co. chairman Michael Eisner said
everything was going to be just fine. Alvin Toffler, author of
``Future Shock,'' said the answers lie in fusing education with the
media.
   But for those assembled Wednesday at the American Newspaper
Publishers Association's 104th annual meeting, one of the most
compelling statements during a panel discussion titled ``A Look at
the Future'' came from Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion
Lab:
   ``There is a very large segment of our country that is not
influenced by the L.A. Times'' or television news ``because by
anyone's definition, they are functionally illiterate.''
   The panel discussion, with TV newswoman Diane Sawyer as
moderator, also included John Malone, director of Denver-based
Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest cable systems
operator, and John Seely Brown, a vice president of the Xerox
Research Center.
   The 90-minute discussion touched on myriad issues confronting
the future of print journalism, from dwindling readership to the
proliferation of giant-corporation mergers.
   ``Are we talking about a limited number of huge corporations
controlling everything in this country and are you going to buy CBS
or what?'' Sawyer asked Eisner. The Disney chairman did not answer
the second part of the question despite widespread speculation that
his studio was interested in purchasing the bottom-ranked TV
network.
   ``It takes huge corporations to compete in a world market,''
Eisner replied. ``But do I think it was necessary for Time to buy
Warner's to compete? No, I think that was a fabrication of the
moment.''
   Asked by Sawyer to give a headline for the upcoming decade,
Malone joked, ``Murdoch Stripped of U.S. Citizenship'' and
``President Turner Cites First Amendment Abuses.''
   Futurist Toffler was more political and slightly more ambitious,
speculating that ``Japan and the U.S. form an integrated economic
and political system.''
   And on the subject of whether computer networks will someday
provide news at the touch of a key and thereby replace newspapers,
Allen said, ``The interest of people in reading in our society is
declining. The great difficulty is how do we get people to be
interested in information. Getting the technology there is easy.''

<HEAD>Consumers Like New Lean Meat Label, USDA Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers apparently have generally accepted a
new federal label for lean beef since the Agriculture Department
carved it out more than two years ago.
   The new labeling took effect in November 1987 after consumer and
industry people petitioned USDA for a name change in official
federal beef grading, said Jimmy Wise of the department's
Agricultural Marketing Service.
   ``Consumers told us they wanted a more positive description of
leaner meat available in grocery stores, and they got it,'' Wise
said Wednesday.
   The change involved scrapping the 60-year-old ``USDA Good''
label and substituting a new ``lean'' label on supermarket cuts.
   Many nutrition-conscious consumers wanted the name change
because they felt the ``Good'' label misled buyers into thinking
the beef was mediocre. When the label was established in the 1920s,
it described the amount of fat, or marbling, in a cut of beef.
   The consumer view was that less fat was more healthful and that
the ``Good'' label wasn't descriptive.
   A consumer organization, Public Voice for Food and Health
Policy, petitioned USDA in June 1986 to change the name from
``Good'' to ``Select.'' The change, also endorsed by a dozen other
consumer and health groups, went into effect in November 1987.
   The push to a ``Select'' beef grade also was supported by the
cattle and meat packing industries, including the American Meat
Institute, National Cattlemen's Association and the American Farm
Bureau Federation.
   Wise said the ``Select'' grade was adopted as the result of ``a
welcome coalition between industry and consumers.'' Moreover, he
said,``Select'' beef is selling well.
   ``That wouldn't be happening if people weren't happy with it,''
Wise said. ``Industry is responding by providing more leaner beef
for grading, and more retailers are beginning to carry the
product.''
   In the three months prior to the official name change, only
49,714 pounds, or 1.7 percent of all graded beef, qualified as
``Good.'' By the fourth quarter of 1989, the ``Select'' label
accounted for 433,413 pounds, or 14.3 percent of all graded beef,
according to agency records.
   Since the 1920s, USDA has provided eight grades and standards to
beef quality. Those are: Prime, Choice, Good (now Select),
Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner.
   Federal grading by USDA is a voluntary service that is requested
by packers and paid for by user fees.
   It is designed to help assure the industry and consumers of
uniform standards for a variety of commodities other than beef and
cattle, including cotton, dairy products, fruit, other livestock,
mohair, poultry rabbits, shell eggs, tobacco, vegetables and wool.

   A House Agriculture subcommittee has approved
a foreign trade section of the 1990 farm bill that would allow food
giveaways to needy countries.
   The legislation is similar to the Senate measure on foreign
trade approved in committee earlier this month. The farm bill will
set agriculture policy for the next five years.
   An aide to the House committee said the major difference between
the two bills is the way the food aid programs would be managed
within the government.
   Both bills would allow the president to give food to countries
whose governments he wants to encourage, like those of Eastern
Europe. Currently, such assistance must be in the form of a sale.
   The bills also allow the United States to forgive the debts of
financially strapped countries trying to restructure their economic
programs.
   Both the House and the Senate followed Bush administration
recommendations in writing their bills.
   Ann Veneman, the Agriculture Department's deputy undersecretary
for international affairs and commodity programs, said the chief
difference the administration has with either bill is in the
language dealing with the Export Enhancement Program.
   Under the program, exporters collect bonuses, or subsidies, for
sales of certain products to designated countries. The program is
used to reduce the prices of U.S. commodities in order to meet
foreign competition.
   The Senate bill says USDA must spend at least $900 million in
fiscal 1991 on the program. The House versions requires that $500
million be spent. But the administration does not want any specific
dollar amount named.
   ``It's a trade policy tool,'' said Veneman. She said the amount
spent should be the prerogative of the administration.

   The Agriculture Department says a record
492,000 acres of national forest land were replanted to trees last
year.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said Wednesday the
acreage was the most since the national forest system was created
in 1905.
   Robertson said last year's effort was due in part to
rehabilitation work in areas burned by the major wildfires of 1987
in California, Oregon and Washington, and to high levels of
reforestation in areas of 1986-88 timber harvests in the national
forests.
   Of the total area reforested in the fiscal year that ended last
Sept. 30, about 307,000 acres were directly seeded or planted to
trees. The remaining 185,000 acres were reforested through natural
regeneration, by seed falling from nearby trees onto areas prepared
by the Forest Service, or through sprouting.
   Robertson said the previous record was 434,000 acres reforested
in 1980. An estimated 460,000 acres will be reforested this fiscal
year, he said.

<HEAD>Publishing Giant Considering Selling Part of Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. has
confirmed that discussions are underway for the possible sale of
part of its business.
   The announcement Wednesday followed months of denials from the
giant publisher that its assets were for sale in an effort to
reduce the company's $1.5 billion debt.
   But Peter Jovanovich, president and chief executive officer,
said in a statement that the Orlando-based corporation ``is not for
sale.''
   Instead, he said, the company has begun preliminary talks
involving the sale of some or all of its existing debt at a
discount, or the purchase of ``certain assets of the company by a
third party.''
   ``It is simply premature to speculate as to whether a
transaction will occur, and, if one does occur, as to its eventual
form or terms,'' he said.
   The statement was released hours after a report that former U.S.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who has served for a decade on HBJ's board,
said the company had held talks for a month with Thomson Corp. of
Canada.
   HBJ is saddled with debt, and its textbook business does not
generate enough income to meet its future obligations. Within three
years, the publisher is to start paying hundreds of millions of
dollars annually in dividends and interest to bondholders.
   HBJ incurred the debts through a recapitalization that fought
off a hostile takeover in 1987.
   Thomson, in turn, has been seeking publishing assets. Last year,
the company had sales of $5.1 billion from operations involving
educational, medical and scientific books as well as newspapers.
   McCarthy said he didn't know when a sale might occur.
   ``There's no conclusion in sight,'' he said. ``It's a question
of what kind of pressure we're under.''
   In the past week, HBJ stock has risen 25 percent on speculation
that the company was discussing a sale to Thomson.
   HBJ common stock closed Wednesday at $4, unchanged from Tuesday.
The stock was one of the most actively traded issues on the New
York Stock Exchange, with more than 3 million shares changing hands.
   Analysts were not surprised to hear that HBJ's debt might force
the sale of additional assets. In the last three years, HBJ has
sold its theme parks, its magazines and its book clubs.
   ``Sometimes the generator just can't generate,'' said Ivan
Obolensky, who follows HBJ for the Josephthal &amp; Co. brokerage in
New York. ``It's a shame, but they have to make some adjustments.''
   HBJ has said it wanted to refinance its debt, possibly extending
it so interest payments on the bonds are less onerous. But the
company may have found that it cannot refinance any debt until it
presents creditors with cash.
   ``The company is under a lot of pressure. The stock and bonds
are way down, and it has been blasted in the media recently,'' said
Bert Boksen, who follows HBJ for the Raymond James &amp; Associates
brokerage in St. Petersburg, Fla.

<TEXT>
   The costs of the Exxon Valdez oil spill
should be measured not only in dead otters and oiled birds but in
neglected children, broken families and shaken communities,
environmentalists said in a report.
   The report, timed for release on the day of the annual Exxon
shareholder meeting in Houston, includes comments by more than 120
Alaskans from hearings held by a citizens commission in November at
Cordova, Kodiak, Old Harbor, Homer and Anchorage.
   ``The human impacts of the oil spill have largely been ignored,
but they're continuing,'' Doug Miller, director of the National
Wildlife Federation's Alaska office, said Wednesday.
   The federation was one of the sponsors of the report, which
criticizes Exxon for ignoring the human costs of the March 24,
1989, spill, and calls on it to help pay for social services.
   Exxon spokesman Jim Robertson in Anchorage said company
officials had not had time to read the report to respond to it.
   Members of the citizens commission said residents around the
sound reported increased alcoholism, domestic violence, child abuse
and neglect.
   ``It certainly wasn't just a wildlife disaster,'' said
conservationist Celia Hunter. ``People were totally torn out of
their whole way of life. It's a catastrophe like a hurricane.''
   Many in the affected communities made money from the cleanup
``boom,'' receiving high wages from Exxon to scrub beaches. But
such ``spillionaires'' created envy and anger in the communities
the commission visited, Hunter said.
   Native communities living off the land were hit particularly
hard, the report said.
   Commission member Ralph Eluska, president of the Akhiok-Kaguyak
Native Corporation, said Akhiok villagers still were afraid of
catching and eating seafood, activities at the center of their
communal life. And cleaning up beaches, he said, has been a
frustrating substitute for fishing.
   The state reported Wednesday that 80 percent of the shoreline
sites inspected by a team preparing this season's cleanup of the
Exxon Valdez spill still have oil on them.
   Most of the 481 sites surveyed in Prince William Sound and the
Gulf of Alaska were lightly or very lightly oiled, while 12 percent
were moderately oiled and 6 percent heavily oiled, the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation reported.
   The survey was conducted this month by state and federal
agencies, Exxon and Alaska Native landowners. The group's
conclusions will be used to help determine what kind of treatment
should be applied to the beaches this summer.
   ``There is still a lot of oil present, either on the surface or
beneath it, and we need to choose the right tools and stick with
them until the job is done,'' said department commissioner Dennis
Kelso.
   Exxon is preparing its final cleanup plan, to be released
Friday. But spokesman Fred Davis said Exxon was ``not terribly
surprised'' by the state's figures ``because the sites that we went
to are the ones that all parties agreed had the highest probability
of having oil.''
   The interagency group expects to survey a total 617 sites before
its project is completed at the end of the month.
   The state has said it can't approve bioremediation _ the use of
fertilizer to boost naturally occurring oil-eating bacteria at
cleanup sites _ until it receives reports from the Environmental
Protection Agency on the fertilizer's toxicity.
   Davis said bioremediation will be ``a major part of the
company's work program.''

<HEAD>Japan's NKK Increases Stake In National Intergroup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Intergroup Inc. tentatively has
agreed to sell most of its 50 percent stake in National Steel Corp.
to NKK Corp., a Japanese company that already owns the other half
of the steelmaker.
   Howard M. Love, chairman and chief executive officer of
Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup, said Wednesday the deal
realizes his company's goals of shedding its steel interest to
focus on its growing pharmaceutical distribution division.
   National Intergroup also wants to allow NKK to have more
influence in National Steel, Love said.
   NKK will pay $147 million cash for 20 percent of National Steel,
then in a second stage will pay preferred stock with a face value
of $147 million for another 20 percent.
   After the transaction is completed, National Intergroup will own
10 percent of National Steel, and NKK will own the remaining 90
percent.
   NKK is Japan's second-largest steelmaker and the world's sixth
largest.
   ``I am convinced that NKK is committed to building a stronger
NSC for its employees and continuing NSC's reputation as a
dependable supplier to its customers,'' Love said. ``NKK has the
resources and technological expertise that will be fundamental to
NSC's future success.''
   ``Our company is strongly committed to the steel business and we
are prepared to provide the support required to bring National
Steel to its full potential as a high quality supplier,'' said
Yoshinari Yamashiro, president and chief executive officer of NKK.
   Kokichi Hagiwara, president and chief operating officer of
National Steel, said the company expects to continue its ongoing
$1.8 billion capital improvement and modernization plan.
   ``NSC has a strong team in place,'' he said. ``Management and
employee policies and labor and customer contracts will not
change.''
   The deal is contingent on a definitive agreement being reached
by the directors of National Intergroup and NKK, officials said.
   National Intergroup reported sales of $3.1 billion in fiscal
1989. NKK's sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1989 were
$9.6 billion.
   National Steel, the nation's sixth-largest steel maker, had
sales of $2.6 billion in the year that ended Dec. 31, 1989.
   National Intergroup began leaving the steel business in 1983
when it sold the Weirton Steel division. It sold 50 percent of its
remaining basic steel business to NKK in 1984 for $292 million.

   The stock market chalked up a broad gain today,
extending Wednesday's modest rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.24 to 2,675.68 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.18 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts attributed the upswing primarily to ``bargain hunting''
by traders after a week-long slide in stock prices through
Tuesday's session.
   Many observers questioned how far the advance could go unless it
gets some encouragement from a letup in upward pressure on interest
rates.
   The next test of Wall Street's mood was expected to come Friday
morning with the Commerce Department's first official estimate of
the gross national product for the first quarter of 1990.
   Economists are looking for the data to show up a pickup in
growth, and quite possibility new stirrings of inflation as well.
   Compaq Computer climbed 6 to 100. The company reported
first-quarter earnings of $2.13 a share, against $1.96 in the
comparable period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.68 to 182.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.17 at 345.69.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.94 to
2,666.44.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 784 up, 653 down and 524 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 133.48 million shares, against 137.36
million in the previous session.

   Most of 1,700 corporate jobs at Marshall Field &amp;
Co.'s central headquarters may be eliminated as part of a
consolidation effort by Dayton Hudson Corp., the company acquiring
Field's.
   Dayton Hudson told Marshall Field &amp; Co. employees in a letter
Wednesday that the Chicago retailer's central functions will be
merged with Dayton Hudson's once the acquisition is completed. A
skeleton staff of Field's current 1,700 corporate employees will
remain in Chicago.
   Telephone calls by The Associated Press to both Dayton Hudson
and Marshall Field offices went unanswered this morning.
   Last Thursday, Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson announced it
would acquire Marshall Field's for $1.04 billion, beating out
several suitors including a group of Field's managers.
   Dayton Hudson expects to complete the deal within two months.
BAT Industries PLC of Britain put the 24-store chain up for sale
last year.
   In the letter, Dayton Hudson said it will offer jobs in Chicago
and Minneapolis to certain Marshall Field's central office
employees to fill openings in a new organization. A Marshall
Field's regional organization, focused on customer service and
community involvement, will be based in Chicago, the letter said.
   Of the 1,700 corporate employees, 350 to 400 are in the
merchandise group, including buyers and managers. Remaining jobs
are largely administrative and operational.
   Employees will be notified as soon as possible if their
positions will be eliminated, the letter said. They will be offered
severance packages and placement services.
   ``It's our goal that when the transition is complete, you'll
feel that you've been treated with sensitivity and
professionalism,'' said the letter signed by Dayton Hudson
President Stephen E. Watson and Chairman Marvin W. Goldstein.
   Still unclear is whether Field's Chairman Philip B. Miller, who
led the management buyout bid, will stay on. Miller would say only
that there are ``ongoing discussions with senior management members
... regarding continued employment with Dayton Hudson.''
   Meanwhile today, Field's Chairman Philip B. Miller, who led an
employee buyout bid, and president Burnett Donoho, announced they
will be leaving Field's shortly after Dayton Hudson's acquisition
is completed.
   ``We will be working ... to insure a smooth transition of
ownership for our associates and customers,'' Miller said in a news
statement. Neither announced future plans.
   Dayton Hudson's department store division operates 37 stores
known as either Dayton's or Hudson's in seven Midwestern states.

<HEAD>Xerox Reports $254 Million First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. on Thursday reported a
first-quarter loss of $254 million, or $2.93 per share, stemming
from its interest in a struggling Chicago-based real estate
investment firm.
   Otherwise, the company reported ``good growth'' in its document
processing business and a slump in earnings from its financial
services division that it attributed to the weak market for
property and casualty insurance.
   The Stamford-based business products and financial services
company announced earlier this year that it had taken a $400
million pre-tax writeoff due to its investment in VMS Realty
Partners, a Chicago real estate investment firm. After taxes, the
writeoff totaled $375 million, Xerox said.
   Even without the writeoff, Xerox earnings from continuing
operations in the first three months of the year slumped to $121
million, or $1.06 per share, from $158 million, or $1.47 a share,
in the same period of 1989.
   The company said its document processing division, which
includes its copier business, earned $110 million on revenue of
$3.1 billion, up from $91 million on $2.8 billion in revenue in the
same period in 1989.
   Earnings from continuing operations in the company's financial
services division slumped to $11 million on revenue of $1.2
billion, down from $67 on revenue of $1.3 billion in the same
period a year ago.
   David T. Kearns, Xerox's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the growth in document processing earnings and revenues were
particularly encouraging in light of the soft market for business
products.
   But he said those gains ``were more than offset within our
continuing operations by substantial weakness in the property and
casualty insurance business and lower capital gains.''

   Stock prices turned downward today after an
early advance bogged down in the face of rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 10 points in
the early going, was down 5.85 at 2,660.59 by 11 a.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 473 up, 709 down and

   Analysts attributed the early gains to ``bargain hunting'' by

upward pressure continued on interest rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell about $5 for each

<DATELINE>ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. Chairman Stephen M. Wolf pledged
today to manage United Airlines' parent company as aggressively as
he can while its employees try to accomplish their $4.38 billion
buyout.
   Wolf, the company's chairman since late 1987, is likely to be
replaced by United's three labor unions if they succeed in getting
the financing for their $201-per-share bid, which UAL's board has
accepted.
   Separately, UAL reported a first quarter loss of $36.4 million
on revenue of $2.19 billion, compared with a profit of $65.44
million on sales of $2.04 billion in the year-ago period.
   ``I want you to know that I will continue to manage the company
in as aggressive a fashion as possible,'' Wolf said in remarks
prepared for today's annual shareholders meeting.
   Wolf said UAL's board and management ``are committed to using
these next few months to deliver the strongest possible United
Airlines to its new owners.''
   He said he was opposed ``in principle'' to any group borrowing
money to buy an airline ``given the cyclical nature of the business
and the enormous capital investments required in the industry.''
   But he said that if ``leveraging is inevitable, as it was in
this case, I believe the preferable course to be employee
ownership.''
   Wolf reportedly fought the employee buyout plan behind the
scenes but ultimately relented. The board had to choose between
selling the nation's second-largest airline to its 71,000 employees
or facing a proxy fight with UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston
Partners, that could have ousted the company's directors.

   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Pressuring prices is Wednesday's 10-day National Weather Service
forecast that calls for warmer and drier-than-normal conditions.
   Analysts say the ideal planting weather could help nearby corn
and soybean prices because of fears of a hot and dry summer. Warm
weather at times reduces the amount of land given over to soybeans.
   Soybean prices also may receive a boost from overall good demand
for soybean oil.
   Wheat futures are being pressured by a decline in the price of
spot soft red winter wheat. Pressure on wheat futures also stems
from the good growing weather and expected higher yields.
   At the open, wheat was 3{ cents lower to a \ cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.67{ a bushel; corn was a \

   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures were mostly higher
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Hog prices were supported by higher cash prices and firmness in
the pork product market. Pork belly futures received some support

   Livestock futures were pressured by lower cash prices.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. said Thursday its
first-quarter profit rose 10.8 percent due to growth in the
company's international business.
   For the three-month period ended March 31, the Houston-based
personeal computer maker earned $92.2 million, or $2.13 a share,
compared with earnings of $83.2 million, or $1.95 a share, during
the same quarter in 1989.
   Sales for the 1990 quarter totaled $872.2 million, up 28 percent
from the $683 million recorded a year ago.
   ``Compaq's first-quarter results reflect an extremely strong
growth rate in our international business,'' Compaq President Rod
Canion said.
   ``For the first time, our international sales comprised more
than half of our revenue. Our international revenue grew 56
percent, fueled primarily by strong European PC (personal computer)
market growth and increasing Compaq market share in Europe,'' he
said in a statement.
   Canion said the company's North American revenue increase of 4
percent reflected the sluggish business personal computer market.
   Compaq in March began shipping its Deskpro 486-25, its
highest-performance desktop computer, which is based on the new
80486 microprocessor from Intel Corp. Compaq had delayed
distribution of the computer last fall because early verions of the
chip were found to be faulty.
   During the first quarter, Compaq also announced it was
reauthorizing Businessland, a major computer store chain, to sell
and service the company's products. Compaq's relationship with
Businessland had been discontinued in April 1989.

<HEAD>OSHA to Propose New Safety Rules in Aftermath of Texas Explosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department will expedite new safety
requirements for the petrochemical industry in an effort to prevent
disasters such as last year's Phillips explosion that killed 23
workers in Texas, the agency said today in a report to President
Bush.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said its
investigation of last October's blast, which injured another 130
workers, demonstrated the need for mandatory safety procedures at
plants that store and use highly flammable liquids and chemicals.
   ``The investigation of the Phillips catastrophe has caused OSHA
to take stock and consider a strong course of action to prevent
such disasters,'' the report to Bush said.
   OSHA said that by the end of the summer it would propose
requirements that employers implement so-called chemical process
safety management plans.
   Those plans would include analyzing hazards to employees,
training workers on safety and developing emergency response
procedures, said Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard Scannell, who
heads OSHA.
   Scannell said that most firms in the petrochemical industry
already use such fundamental safety procedures, but OSHA's new
rules would make them mandatory.
   OSHA also will consider revising the way it sets priorities for
inspections and devoting more attention to the petrochemical
industry, Scannell said.
   Last week, OSHA proposed a $5.7 million fine against Phillips 66
Co. for alleged safety violations at the plant. OSHA's
investigation showed that four highly flammable gases escaped from
an open valve, forming a huge vapor cloud that traveled through the
Pasadena, Texas, plant within seconds because of high pressure.
   A series of explosions occurred after the cloud came in contact
with an unidentified ignition source.
   Contrary to Phillips' own procedures, as well as standard
industry practice, there was no backup protection such as a double
valve to protect against valve failure or protect against an
untimely valve opening, Scannell said.

<TEXT>
   Motorists are losing more than $150 million a
year at gas stations that sell low-octane gas at high-octane
prices, and the federal government is doing little to stop it, a
congressional report said today.
   The General Accounting Office said a two-year study, which
included random testing of retail gasoline in four states, showed
widespread mislabeling of gasoline octane levels.
   The GAO estimated that about 9 percent of gasoline sold
nationwide is mislabeled. It said that more than half the samples
taken in two large cities last year _ Detroit and St. Louis _ were
found to have octane ratings an average of 2.2 or more points below
what was posted on the pump.
   ``What this adds up to is a quiet but dangerous shell-game for
consumers,'' said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who asked for
the study along with Rep. Phillip Sharp, D-Ind.
   Higher octane gas can prevent damaging engine knock and affect
the performance of some cars.
   In some instances, gas stations were pumping all their gas out
of the same tank but selling it as having different octane ratings,
said Sharp, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee
on energy and power. Sharp said he would introduce legislation to
give states more enforcement powers over octane cheats.
   ``A consumer could be paying several cents a gallon extra for
quality that is not delivered,'' Sharp told a news conference
releasing the report.
   David Morehead, spokesman for the Petroleum Marketers
Association of America, said there have been scattered reports of
octane cheating but it is ``absolutely deplored in the industry.''
   ``We say go after the cheaters and get them,'' Morehead said,
noting that the vast majority of retailers who follow the law are
hurt by operators who take extra profits by charging premium prices
for regular gas.
   A 1978 law requires the Federal Trade Commission and the
Environmental Protection Agency to enforce compliance with federal
petroleum marketing practices. But the GAO study said the agencies,
citing lack of funds, have not carried out testing since 1981.
   The federal law requires uniform yellow and black octane labels
on all gasoline pumps. Violators may be fined up to $10,000 for
each instance.
   Mislabeling has been minimal in states that conduct their own
tests, said the report by Congress's investigative arm.
   But in non-testing states visited by GAO investigators, problems
were found, mainly at the distribution and retail levels, the
report said. One-time testing was conducted in Michigan, Missouri,
Oregon and Tennessee, GAO said, and investigators also looked at
Indiana, Montana and Washington.
   Federal standards say regular unleaded gas must have an octane
rating of 87, while mid-grade gasolines have ratings of from 89 to
91 and super or premium grades have ratings of 92 to 94. The
difference in retail price between the lowest and highest grade
ranges up to 20 cents.

   Health care products giant Johnson &amp;
Johnson on Thursday blamed loan payments in Argentina for a 23.2
percent dip in earnings despite a 16.1 percent rise in sales for
the first quarter of 1990.
   Earnings for the period were $244 million, or 73 cents per
share, on sales of $2.84 billion, compared with $317 million, or 95
cents per share, on sales of $2.45 billion for the same period a
year ago.
   The latest results were reduced by a nonrecurring charge of $125
million resulting from paying off an Argentine subsidiary's loan
that was growing rapidly because of inflation in that country.
   Excluding the nonrecurring costs, the company said its earnings
would have risen 16.4 percent.
   ``We are very pleased with the 16 percent increase in sales,
especially in the light of the extreme competitive environment in
the domestic consumer environment,'' Johnson &amp; Johnson Chairman
Ralph S. Larsen said in a statement.
   ``The increase reflects substantial sales gains from worldwide
and professional operations, as well as strong international
revenues from our Consumer businesses,'' he said.
   Larsen said sales of six key products, including a blood
screening product for Hepatitis C, increased substantially in the
quarter.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson is the world's largest manufacturer of health
care products serving consumer, pharmaceutical and professional
markets. It reported 1989 sales of $9.76 billion.

   Stock prices rebounded from a midday pullback
and the market was mixed this afternoon.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 3.15 at 2,663.29
at noontime, was up 6.08 at 2,672.52 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 635 up, 735 down and
530 unchanged.
   The market got off to a strong start today with the Dow Jones
industrial average ahead by nearly 10 points in the early going.
But the advance bogged down in the face of rising interest rates.
   Analysts attributed the early gains to ``bargain hunting'' by
traders after a week-long slide in stock prices through Tuesday's
session. But they said the rally apparently keeps meeting
resistance from upward pressure on interest rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds fell about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value today, increasing their yields to the 9.02
percent-9.10 percent range.
   The next test of Wall Street's mood was expected to come Friday
morning with the Commerce Department's first official estimate of
the gross national product for the first quarter of 1990.
   Economists are looking for the data to show a pickup in growth,
and quite possiby new stirrings of inflation as well.

   Anheuser-Busch Inc. announced on Thursday that
it has signed a $100 million advertising contract with the ESPN
cable sports network.
   Officials said the contract, the largest sponsorship commitment
ever for cable television, makes the brewer of Budweiser the
dominant beer advertiser on the network for another five years.
   Anheuser-Busch was ESPN's charter advertiser with a one-year,
$1.4 million advertising contract when the sports cable network
began operations in September 1979.
   ``Anheuser-Busch was ESPN's first major advertiser and has
consistently remained our largest, said Roger L. Werner, ESPN
president and chief executive officer. ``We're delighted to extend
our relationship, and we trust that ESPN will continue to
contribute to Anheuser-Busch's success.''
   ESPN reaches nearly 56 million homes, or 61 percent of all U.S.
television households.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, commands a 42
percent share of the U.S. beer market.

<HEAD>Hotel Strike Hurt Hawaii Tourist Count</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 22-day hotel worker strike drove the March
visitor count down by 2.5 percent from March 1989, the Hawaii
Visitors Bureau reported Thursday.
   As publicity surrounding the strike increased, so did
cancellations, the bureau said.
   Some 582,000 people visited the Islands last month, a decline of
15,000 from the year before. The HVB had recorded four straight
months of increases before March.
   Some 7,500 employees of 11 hotels walked off the job March 3 in
a dispute over pay and benefits. The hotels and Local 5 of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union settled the strike
on March 24.
   HVB President Stanley Hong said the strike had the greatest
impact on westbound arrivals _ tourists from the mainland United
States, Canada and Europe.
   The number of westbound visitors was down 6.2 percent in March
to 408,000, the HVB said.
   The number of eastbound visitors _ from Japan and the western
Pacific region _ still climbed, but not as much as in recent
months. Eastbound arrivals increased by 7.3 percent to 173,000, a
decline from the double-digit growth recorded during the previous
two months.

<HEAD>United, USAir Report First-Quarter Losses, Delta's Profit Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent companies of USAir and United Airlines reported
first-quarter losses Thursday, while Delta Air Lines said its
profit for the latest quarter dropped 63 percent.
   UAL Corp., parent of United, said it lost $36.4 million, or
$1.68 a share, in the three months ended March 31, primarily due to
the settlement of several lawsuits involving its computer
reservation system.
   Without a charge against earnings of $77.5 million due to the
settlement, earnings would have been $10.2 million, or 47 cents a
share, the Chicago-based company said. UAL reported earnings of
$65.4 million, or $3.03 a share, for the first quarter of 1989.
   UAL reported first-quarter operating revenue of $2.5 billion,
compared with $2.3 billion for the same period last year.
   ``Although we achieved a slight profit for the quarter after
excluding the one-time charge for settlement of lawsuits, we are
nevertheless disappointed by these results,'' said UAL Chairman
Stephen M. Wolf.
   He said higher fuel costs contributed to the company's poor
showing.
   UAL in March settled a lawsuit filed by Continental Airlines and
several other carriers accusing United of unfair competition in the
computerized reservations business. The lawsuits, filed in 1985,
contended United illegally monopolized or attempted to monopolize
the computer reservations business or the air transportation
business in various markets.
   Continental, owned by Texas Air Corp., had sought $336 million
in damages, arguing that United programmed its computer
reservations system to unfairly favor United flights over its
competitors.
   On April 10, UAL's board approved a $4.38 billion buyout bid for
the airline by its unions.
   USAir Group, the parent of USAir, reported a first-quarter loss
of $38 million, or $1.05 a share, blaming it on higher fuel prices
and the fact that the peak Easter travel period fell in this year's
second quarter.
   USAir Group, based in Arlington, Va., earned $16 million, or 35
cents a share, in 1989's first quarter.
   First-quarter 1990 revenue totaled $1.54 billion, up from $1.48
billion for the same period a year earlier.
   ``Traffic levels through the first quarter were up 8.5 percent,
slightly ahead of our projections,'' USAir Chairman and President
Edwin I. Colodny said. ``Despite relatively strong passenger
traffic, revenue continues to be on the weak side.''
   Colodny said several factors boosted last year's first quarter,
hurting the comparison with the first quarter of this year: a
strike against Eastern Airlines that began in early March 1989, and
the peak Easter travel period falling in March last year and April
this year.
   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. blamed sharply increased fuel
costs for its lower earnings in its third fiscal quarter on sharply
increased fuel costs.
   Profit totaled $31.31 million, or 48 cents a share, for the
three months ended March 31, down from $85.02 million, or $1.73 a
share, in the same period last year. Operating revenue rose 4
percent, to $2.12 billion from $2.04 billion.
   Higher fuel prices outweighed strong business traffic, fare
increases and increased cargo revenue, said Thomas J. Roeck, senior
vice president for finance.
   Roeck also cited the timing of Easter and the start of the
Eastern strike in last year's first quarter as factors that made it
difficult to match the results of a year earlier. Eastern is a
major competitor of Delta at Atlanta, where both airlines have
their main hubs.
   For the nine months ended March 31, Delta said its net income
was $228.69 million, or $4.15 a share, down 15 percent from $270.14
million, or $5.49 a share, during the same period a year earlier.
Revenue rose 10 percent to $6.34 billion from $5.78 billion.

<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. reported Thursday
that its first-quarter profit fell 27.5 percent because of the
impact of economic troubles on its Brazilian affiliates.
   Whirlpool, the world's largest appliance maker, has minority
interests in Brazilian companies that produce and market appliances
and refrigeration compressors.
   Whirlpool said it had net income of $29.5 million, or 42 cents a
share, in the three months ended March 30, down from $40.7 million,
or 59 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Excluding a loss of 26 cents a share due to the problems in
Brazil, first-quarter earnings would have risen 11 percent, the
company said.
   First-quarter revenue rose 3.8 percent to $1.64 billion from
$1.58 billion a year earlier.
   Chairman David R. Whitwam predicted that economic controls
imposed to fight rampaging inflation in Brazil would hurt
Whirlpool's operating results into the second quarter, with gradual
improvement for the rest of the year.
   The company manufactures products in 10 countries and markets
them in more than 45.

<HEAD>Anti-Smoking Resolutions Defeated by Tobacco Company Shareholders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stockholders of food and tobacco giant
Philip Morris Cos. Inc. overwhelmingly rejected two resolutions
Thursday aimed against the company's core cigarette products, but
supporters of the proposals claimed a symbolic victory.
   ``We feel we accomplished a great deal getting that kind of a
vote,'' the Rev. Michael Crosby said after his proposal calling for
Philip Morris to get out of tobacco by the end of the century got
2.2 percent of the vote at the company's annual shareholders'
meeting.
   Another resolution calling on Philip Morris to study the impact
of its promotions and advertising on teen-age smoking failed with
only 3.5 percent support.
   ``The point is, we got our issue across,'' said Crosby, who
fought a two-year legal battle to get his resolution on the agenda
for the meeting at Philip Morris' huge cigarette manufacturing
plant here.
   Hamish Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of the New
York-based company, said he could not envision Philip Morris
without tobacco, despite growing concerns about the effects of
smoking on health and the company's extensive forays into other
consumer products.
   Philip Morris has operations that include Kraft foods and Miller
beer, but tobacco ``is our core business,'' Maxwell said.
   The dissident shareholders said their resolutions addressed
profits as well as social concerns.
   ``This company is going, sooner or later, to be liable for its
actions,'' said Crosby, a Catholic priest who works for the
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility in New York. ``We are
going to lose in the long run.''
   Maxwell acknowledged that cigarettes ``are our most
controversial product'' but said the company has acted responsibly
to health concerns in its development of reduced tar and nicotine
cigarettes. He also said warnings about the dangers of smoking are
widely publicized.
   Crosby pressed Maxwell to admit that smoking and sickness have a
direct link, but Maxwell said medical research has not gone that
far.
   ``You weasel out of it every time,'' Crosby said.
   ``I'm not weaseling out of anything,'' Maxwell said.
   According to company figures, Philip Morris sold 580 billion
cigarettes in 1989, including 78 billion cigarettes for export. Its
Marlboro brand is the U.S. leader with 26 percent of the market and
has 55 percent of the company's overseas tobacco sales.
   Dr. Alan Blum, founder of the Augusta, Ga.-based DOC News and
Views, a publication that bills itself as a journal of medical
activism, said Marlboro and other Philip Morris brands are
responsible for most of the 1.3 million people who take up smoking
each year, many of them teen-agers.
   Maxwell, however, said overall cigarette consumption dropped
about 3 percent in the United States last year and was stable
abroad. The company's increased profits from tobacco resulted from
taking away business from competitors among adults who already
smoke, he said.
   ``We do not aim our marketing efforts to minors,'' he said. ``In
fact, we take active steps to discourage'' youths from smoking.
   One shareholder who did not identify himself drew applause from
the approximately 300 shareholders at the meeting when he said, ``I
think these proposals are utter bunk.'' People can freely choose to
smoke or not smoke, he said.
   ``We aren't free when we're addicted, like me, to cigarettes,''
said Crosby.

<HEAD>St. Louis Sun Fails to Overcome Difficult Odds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Notebooks were tossed in the trash and job
postings were tacked on the bulletin board Thursday at the St.
Louis Sun, the new metropolitan newspaper that abruptly stopped
publishing after only seven months of business.
   The newspaper didn't publish a farewell edition. Its last
newspaper, the 213th edition, appeared Wednesday morning.
   The sudden demise came as a shock to employees, readers,
newspaper analysts and others, and it also underscored the nagging
slowdown that has hit the newspaper industry.
   Local and national newspaper advertising around the country grew
just 4 percent last year, its smallest increase in more than five
years, according to figures provided by the American Newspaper
Publishers Association. Daily newspaper circulation has been
stagnant at about 62 million for a decade and its been declining
the past two years.
   About the only thing going well for newspaper publishers is that
the price of newsprint is about 23 percent lower than last year.
   ``The newspaper market is in turmoil,'' said Ralph Ingersoll II,
chairman and chief executive officer of Ingersoll Publications Co.
and editor-in-chief of the Sun. ``This is at least the third such
crisis I have personally lived through.''
   But Ingersoll, who personally directed the creation of the Sun,
which debuted Sept. 25, 1989, said he didn't know what role the
industrywide troubles played in determining the Sun's fate.
   ``I think it had a direct impact,'' said Kenneth Berents, a
stock analyst in Baltimore with Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. ``It's tough
enough to do a startup, but it's almost impossible to do in a bad
climate like this.''
   When he first set out to bring a second daily newspaper to St.
Louis to compete with the 111-year-old St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
Ingersoll said he hoped his effort would help invigorate the
newspaper industry.
   And even though the Sun didn't make it, he hasn't ruled out the
possibility of trying it again somewhere else. No one else is going
to try it, that's for sure. Why?
   ``First of all, Ingersoll was a maverick and there aren't many
mavericks around. Second of all, this is a very unfriendly
environment for newspapers right now,'' said Lisa Donneson, a stock
analyst in New York for County NatWest USA.
   At a Wednesday news conference, Ingersoll said the reason the
Sun didn't last longer was its failure to sell enough newspapers
out of vending boxes and newspaper racks in stores.
   Ingersoll expected to sell most of the newspapers on a
single-copy basis, but soon after the paper started, home-delivery
sales outnumbered single-copy sales by a two-to-one margin.
   That cost the Sun $5 million more than planned. Ingersoll said
the newspaper had spent more than $25 million to start up, but he
said he didn't know how much of that would be recoverable.
   Thursday, in the Sun newsroom where windows overlook the Gateway
Arch and clocks tell what time it is in Tokyo, some of the
newspaper's 194 full-time employees cleaned out their desks and
pondered the future.
   Some showed up in white shirts and ties and talked about job
interviews they had just returned from. Some still peppered their
sentences with words like ``shocked'' and ``stunned.'' And some
talked about Thursday's softball game, the first of the season.
   ``We're going to play as far as I know,'' said the Sun's
Business editor Dan Kadlec, who was in the office with his wife and
five-month-old daughter. He left a job at USA Today and moved to
St. Louis from New York to work for the Sun. ``I haven't even
unpacked,'' he said.
   Some reporters said they were upset that Ingersoll didn't give
the Sun more time to prove itself and more notice of the
newspaper's collapse. They said the consensus in the office was
that they had two years to try to make it.
   ``I knew that this newspaper might not be around after
two-and-a-half years, but I didn't think he would pull the plug so
soon,'' said Ellen Whitford, a general assignment reporter who came
to the Sun from Virginia.
   ``I'm going to start applying for jobs, but the market's pretty
bad, so I guess you could say I feel pretty grim at the moment,''
she said.
   Ingersoll said all employees would be given at least 12 weeks
severance pay and efforts would be made to find them jobs at other
newspapers in the Ingersoll chain. More than a dozen job listings
are already on the office bulletin boards.
   Meetings were scheduled for Monday and Tuesday to discuss
parting benefits.

   A late rally in blue chip stocks drove the Dow
Jones industrial average to a double-digit gain but the broader
market ended mixed.
   Activity was moderate on Wall Street where some traders marked
time ahead of potentially market-moving economic data due Friday.
Anxiety about possible interest rate hikes ahead also kept
investors on the sidelines.
   The market got off to a promising start but by late morning the
broadly based advance bogged down as prices of long-term government
bonds took a beating in the credit market.
   Some bonds were off as much as $7.50 for each $1,000 in face
value in afternoon trading, bringing their yields back above 9
percent.
   Analysts attributed most of today's scattered stock price gains
to ``bargain hunting'' by traders after a week-long slide that
lasted through Tuesday's session. But they said rallies have had
trouble gaining momentum, daunted by upward pressure on interest
rates.
   The next test of Wall Street's mood was expected to come Friday
morning with the Commerce Department's first official estimate of
the gross national product for the first quarter of 1990.
   Economists expect the data to show a modest resurgence in
growth, and quite possiby new stirrings of inflation as well.
   One of the standouts on Wall Street today was Compaq Computer.
The stock climbed 4&lsqb; to 98&lsqb; after the company reported unexpectedly
strong first-quarter earnings of $2.13 a share, against $1.96 a
year earlier.
   Ames Department Stores, which today announced it has filed for

   Norton topped the Big Board's list of active issues, falling {

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of Boston Corp. said Thursday earnings
plunged about 50 percent in the first quarter of 1990, in part
because of bad real estate loans and a general softening of the
regional economy.
   For the quarter ended March 31, earnings were $44 million, or 56
cents per share, compared with earnings of $89 million, or $1.23 a
share, for the same period a year ago.
   ``We have experienced a continued weakening in the real estate
portfolio and the New England environment, as well as a softening
in the overall climate for highly leveraged transactions,''
Chairman and Chief Executive Ira Stepanian said in a prepared
statement.
   Net credit losses were $81 million for the 1990 quarter compared
with $29 million for the same period a year ago.
   Stepanian said the bank's business in Argentina and Brazil had
strong earnings during the first quarter, but ``we are cautious
about the rest of the year'' because of the volatile economies in
those countries.
   Bank of Boston, New England's largest bank, had assets of $37
billion at the end of the first quarter. The Boston-based bank
provides a broad range of financial services to individual,
corporate, institutional and governmental customers.

<HEAD>Japanese Seek To Curb U.S. Sales Of Nikkei Warrants</HEAD>

   Worried about heavy volatility on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, Japanese market officials have been pressing to
limit U.S. sales of securities pegged to Tokyo's bellwether Nikkei
Stock Index.
   ``They have made their concerns aware to us,'' said Bob
Shabazian, a spokesman for the American Stock Exchange, where eight
Nikkei put and call warrants trade.
   The warrants, which some have been blamed for adding to the
Tokyo exchange's volatility, are used as a hedge against movements
in the 225-share Nikkei index.
   The warrants give their holders the right to purchase or sell
the cash equivalent of the Nikkei index at a certain price on a
certain date. Put warrants give the right to sell and call warrants
the right to buy.
   Speculators also use the warrants to bet on the direction of the
market, for example, buying put warrants if they believe the Nikkei
will decline. As a result, the value of put warrants rises as the
Nikkei falls.
   Since January, the Nikkei has plunged nearly 30 percent in
value, raising the demand among investors in the United States and
elsewhere for the warrants.
   In January, the Kingdom of Denmark became the first issuer to
list Nikkei put warrants on the Amex. Since then, a number of U.S.
investment houses have followed suit, including Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc.
   But American investment houses have agreed to voluntarily halt
issuing further warrants at the request of Japanese officials.
   A spokesperson for Salomon said the firm ``is not going to issue
any additional warrants without the approval of Japanese
authorities.''
   Shabazian said discussions between Amex and Japanese stock
exchange officials over the warrants have been ongoing, even before
Denmark launched the first.
   ``We have an information-sharing agreement with (the
Japanese),'' Shabazian said. But he added, ``we've had no formal
request from them'' to limit trading in the options.
   In what some market watchers believe could be the last issue for
some time, the Financing and Export Credit Institute of the
Norwegian Commercial Banks Ltd. issued 7.5 million warrants and
raised about $28 million on Thursday. The transaction was managed
by Goldman Sachs.
   A spokesman Goldman Sachs noted that ``having just completed a
deal, we're not currently considering another.'' But he added the
firm ``always would respect the direction of the American Stock
Exchange and, by extension, the Tokyo Stock Exchange.''
   Existing warrants would continue to trade until their
expiration. The Norwegian warrants, for example, expire in 1993.

its first quarter-earnings fell 61.4 percent despite a 76 percent

or 44 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   Sales rose to $1 billion from $$570 million a year earlier,
reflecting contributions from Emhart Corp. acquired in 1989.
   Operating income rose 148 percent for the period to $108.2
million, from $43.6 million last year.
   ``Our higher operating income margin, despite a generally
sluggish sales environment, attests to Black &amp; Decker's market

   Assets of the nation's 509 money market mutual
funds fell $816.6 million in the latest week, the fifth-straight
weekly decline, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The drop to $387.89 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.14 billion drop in fund assets the
previous week. That decline originally was reported as $1.25
billion but the Washington-based mutual fund trade group
subsequently revised it.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week
ended March 21, 1990.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 246 general purpose funds rose $563.3 million to $133.62
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.68 billion to
$163.64 billion, and assets of 161 institutional funds rose $299.8
million to $90.64 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday was 7.69 percent, unchanged from the previous
week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in
Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.69 percent from 7.68 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, unchanged, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts was 6.24 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.05 percent, unchanged.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.95
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.91 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.08 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.03 percent; 8.10 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.06 percent;
and 8.14 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.11 percent.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended April 16, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,277.5 billion from $3,275.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,081.9 billion from $4,073.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $810.4 billion from $806 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 5.7 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.1 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,259.2 billion, a 6.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,063.7 billion, up 3 percent, while M1 rose
5.3 percent to an average of $802.4 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $883 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $231 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$296 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $478
million in the two weeks ended April 18, down from $874 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $305.1 billion in the two-week period ended
April 18, up from $302 billion two weeks earlier.

   Energy futures prices closed mostly lower
Thursday on largely technical factors as the market awaited next
week's OPEC meeting.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 19 cents to $18.47 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, adding to a 34 cent drop on
Wednesday. Subsequent contract months also declined.
   The May contract for unleaded regular gasoline fell 1.26 cents

previous session. Subsequent months also fell Thursday.
   But home heating oil for May delivery rose 0.67 cent to 53.07
cents a gallon after falling 0.25 cent on Wednesday. The June
contract also advanced Thursday, but later months declined.
   And natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.558 per million
British thermal units, up from $1.552 on Wednesday.
   Analysts said crude oil prices moved lower as traders with large
holdings adjusted their portfolios in advance of Wednesday's
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries price
monitoring committee.
   The committee is holding a special session to discuss ways of
holding down the cartel's production and stopping oil prices from
falling.
   William Byers, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co., said the
market is on the defensive as it awaits the OPEC session, and until
the meeting ends, trading will be more volatile than usual.
   Near-term heating oil prices were higher on an increase in

<HEAD>Octane Cheaters May Be Selling One Gas as Regular, Premium and
Super Premium</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last graf to add Tennessee to Missouri as state that

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some service stations pass off regular
gasoline as higher-priced super premium, according to a
congressional study Thursday that said ``octane cheating'' may be
costing motorists $150 million a year.
   The report by the General Accounting office estimated that 9
percent of gasoline sold nationwide is mislabeled by half an octane
number or more. And in several states where pump testing has
actually proven mislabeling, the federal government has done little
to stop the deception, the report said
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said motorists who
think they are buying premium grades may be losing $150 million a
year.
   But Rep. Philip R. Sharp, D-Ind., who along with Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., released the report, said the study was
conservative and losses could reach as high as $600 million through
growing mislabeling of octane ratings at the pump.
   Sharp's estimate is based partly on the fact that the GAO said
that more than half the samples taken in two large cities last year
_ Detroit and St. Louis _ were found to have octane ratings an
average of 2.2 or more points below what was posted on the pump.
   ``Unfortunately, consumers cannot determine octane ratings
visually or in other ways that allow them to know if they are
getting what they are paying for,'' the GAO said.
   Federal law requires that uniform yellow and black labels on gas
pumps show the octane rating of gas, and some higher-powered
vehicles recommend various levels of octane to avoid that unhealthy
``ping'' or knocking sound in engines.
   A low octane gas can reduce engine efficiency, mileage and
emissions in high-powered engines, the GAO said.
   Regular unleaded gas is rated at 87, with midgrade unleaded at
89 and premium grades from 91 to 94. Regular leaded gas is rated at
89.
   The difference in retail price between the lowest and highest
grade can range up to 20 cents a gallon.
   ``A consumer could be paying several cents a gallon extra for
quality that is not delivered,'' said Sharp, who is chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on energy and power.
   Sharp said he would introduce legislation to give states more
enforcement power over octane cheaters.
   The report said inspectors found in several states that some
retail stations were selling gasoline from the same storage tank
that was rated at different octane levels.
   At other stations, 87-octane unleaded regular gasoline was being
sold as leaded regular, which should have an 89 rating, because the
wholesale price for unleaded was lower, the report said.
   ``What this adds up to is a quiet but dangerous shell-game for
consumers,'' Schumer said.
   A 1978 law requires the Federal Trade Commission and the
Environmental Protection Agency to enforce compliance with federal
petroleum marketing practices. But the GAO study said the agencies
have not carried out testing since 1981.
   The report said both agencies generally support the GAO's
conclusions and cite lack of funding and staff for their failure to
enforce the labeling rules. Violators may be fined up to $10,000
for each instance.
   Joe Koach, executive director of the 60,000-member Service
Station Dealers of America, said he was ``deeply chagrined because
this broad-brushes the integrity of America's gasoline marketers.''
   Legitimate dealers would not risk their franchises with major
oil companies by cheating, and the organization supports stringent
enforcement against octane cheaters, Koach said.
   David Morehead, spokesman for the Petroleum Marketers
Association of America, said there have been scattered reports of
cheating but it is ``absolutely deplored in the industry.''
   Nearly half of the states conduct their own octane tests, and
mislabeling has been minimal where testing acts as a deterrent, the
GAO study said,
   But in seven non-testing states visited by GAO investigators,
problems were found, mainly at the distribution and retail levels,
the report said. Frequent octane mislabeling was found in one-time
tests conducted in Michigan, Missouri, Oregon and Tennessee, GAO
said, and investigators also found concern about octane cheating
from officials interviewed in Indiana, Montana and Washington.
   In 1989 Michigan tests conducted primarily in Detroit, 51.9
percent of stations had inflated ratings averaging 2.3 octane
points, and in St. Louis 52.6 percent had mislabeled an average of
2.2 points, the report said.
   In 1988 tests conducted by Oregon officials, 21.8 percent of
samples were mislabeled and in Tennessee 22.2 percent, the GAO said.
   States that test generally consider any mislabeling of one-half
point or more in the octane rating as a significant violation, the
GAO said.
   States which conduct their own tests and enforcement are
Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Louisinaa, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin.
   Missouri and Tennessee began testing after the GAO inspections
were conducted. Michigan, New York and Washington plan to begin
octane testing, according to Sharp.

   The dollar finished mostly higher in dull U.S.
trading Thursday after falling in Europe.
   Gold prices fell in New York after rising in Europe. Republic
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of $370.60 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $371.25 late Wednesday.
   The dollar moved in a narrow range in advance of Friday's
release of U.S. gross national product data for the first quarter,
analysts said.
   ``It was a corrective uptick,'' said James Chorek, an analyst at
Money Market Services in Chicago. ``There wasn't much happening on
fundamental ground to move the dollar one way or another.''
   Analysts said the dollar got some support late in the day when
bond prices dropped, pushing the interest rate on the Treasury's
key 30-year bond over 9 percent for the first time since last May.
Rising U.S. rates usually bolster the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell to a closing 158.77 Japanese yen from 159.25 yen on
Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 158.75 yen. By the
end of the day in New York, however, the dollar had risen to 159.23
yen from 158.73 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6340 from $1.6370 late
Wednesday. Later, in New York, one pound fetched $1.6342, down from
$1.6405 the day before.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6797 West German marks, up from
1.6780 marks; 1.4575 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6355 French francs,
up from 5.6345; 1,231.75 Italian lire, up from 1,231.00; and 1.1603
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1608.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6810 West German marks, down from
1.6820; 1.4605 Swiss francs, down from 1.4665; 5.6395 French
francs, down from 5.6455; 1.8915 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8970;
1,231.00 Italian lire, down from 1,234.00, and 1.1602 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1603.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $372.65 a troy ounce
from $371.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose
to a closing bid of $372.75 from $371.00 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.92 to close at a bid of
$373.03.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
settled at $370.50 a troy ounce, down from $370.70 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.96 a
troy ounce from $4.97 bid late Wednesday.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery closed at
$4.913 a troy ounce, down from $4.919 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Rally in Soybeans Pulls Market Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as speculation of low soybean exports from
South America spurred interest in the U.S. crop.
   On other markets, precious metals futures mostly were lower;
energy futures declined and livestock futures were mixed while pork
mostly was higher.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to 2} cents higher with the contract
for delivery in May at $3.70{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 2}
cents higher with May at $2.80} a bushel; oats were a 1 cent to 1{
cents higher with May at $1.60\ a bushel; soybeans were 14 cents to
19\ cents higher with May at $6.26\ a bushel.
   Soybean prices for nearby months reached season highs and later
months reached contract highs as commission houses entered the
market strongly and the price of Brazilian soybeans surged.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, said the Brazilian price rise was an indication that
country will not have a lot of soybeans to export.
   ``The concern of Europeans over delays in South American
shipments may step up their interest in the U.S. market,'' he said.
   Karlin also said concerns about the possibility of
hotter-than-normal temperatures through the summer also fueled
speculation in soybeans. That concern was sparked by the 10-day
National Weather Service forecast released Wednesday that calls for
hotter- and drier-than-normal weather.
   The strength of soybeans spilled into corn and wheat, sending
those prices higher.
   Wheat futures rose despite news that cash prices for soft red
winter wheat plunged during the day. Corn prices were boosted by
speculative and commercial buying.
   Precious metals futures traded in a narrow range on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   ``There is very little buying interest at the moment in gold and
silver,'' said Jerry Rothman, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
in New York, adding there was little news to spur interest in the
market.
   Rothman said the lack of buying interest may mean prices will be
forced even lower, noting that a mild rally Thursday triggered
additional selling.
   Thursday's quiet trading followed Wednesday's frantic session
during which platinum tumbled sharply, pulling down gold and silver
prices.
   Gold was 20 cents lower to 10 cents higher with April at $370.50
a troy ounce; silver was .80 cent to 1 cent lower with May at
$4.914 a troy ounce; platinum was $1.70 to $2.70 higher with July
at $473.90 a troy ounce.
   Energy prices were lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
quiet trading as analysts noted the oversupply of crude oil
continues weighing on the market.
   An emergency session of the oil ministers of the Organization of
Petroelum Exporting Countries is scheduled to convene May 2 in
Geneva to address the slide in crude prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 3 cents to 19 cents lower
with June at $18.47 a barrel; heating oil was .25 cent lower to .67
cent higher with May at 53.07 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.35 cent to 1.26 cents lower with May at 61.34 cents a gallon.
   Livestock futures were mixed and pork futures mostly higher on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .45 cent higher with June at
72.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cert lower to unchanged
with April at 84.7 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 cent to .63
cent higher with June at 63.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .33 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 63.70 cents a
pound.

   Digital Equipment Corp., which has been
slashing its work force, announced another round of voluntary
cutbacks Thursday and said its overall payroll should be reduced by
2,000 employees by July.
   Digital has been hurt by weak U.S. computer sales, though the
company recently reported its first growth in a year from this
sector.
   Digital said Thursday it would offer voluntary severance to 450
workers out of 644 at a Springfield manufacturing plant, and to 221
workers at a Boxboro plant. The company said it expects more than
150 workers to accept the severance package at these two sites.
   Digital previously offered severance to 3,800 workers, and 800
accepted. The company expects to have 2,000 people leave the
company by July 1.
   Digital took a $150 million charge in its fiscal third quarter,
due mostly to the severance program and other shifting of employees.
   Analysts have estimated, however, that Digital will eventually
cut 5,000 workers from its worldwide payroll of 125,000.

   Transamerica Corp. on Thursday reported its
first quarter earnings fell slightly.
   For the latest quarter ended March 31, the financial services
corporation reported net income of $70.3 million, or 88 cents per
share, compared to $70.9 million, or 89 cents a share, in the same
quarter last year.
   Its first quarter earnings included after-tax gains on
investment transactions of $5.2 million. The first quarter 1989
results included investment gains of $19.4 million.
   ``We achieved strong first-quarter performances at virtually all
of our operations,'' said Transamerica Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer James R. Harvey. ``We continue to expect 1990 to be another
strong year for Transamerica.''

   A housing developer on Thursday announced plans
to build an American-style suburban residential complex in Moscow
to meet the needs of foreign businessmen frustrated by the Soviet
Union's scarce and low-quality housing.
   The $130-million project will bring a taste of Western comfort
to 80 acres of rolling land near two villages of log cabins on the
northwest outskirts of Moscow, according to Chris Senie, secretary
of Senie Kerschner International Housing Ltd.
   The project is a joint venture with a collective farm adjacent
to the site. The land is being leased from the collective farm.
   The first of the 528 townhouse units are to be completed in
1991. The development will include amenities such as an indoor
swimming pool, a medical clinic, a gymnasium and stores, Senie said.
   The units will rent for about $50,000 a year on six-year leases,
which is comparable to the costs foreign companies pay for
comparable housing, if they can find any available, Senie said.
   Although the complex will have guard patrols and its stores will
accept only hard currency, the developers don't want it to be a
``foreign ghetto.'' Twenty percent of the units are to be occupied
by Soviet employees of foreign companies.
   Senie said residents of the adjacent villages will be allowed to
use the athletic facilities at times and they will have free access
to a lake that borders the project.
   ``There's no question the project is going to impact their lives
greatly,'' he said.
   The developers also are assisting the collective farm in
completing a 60-acre greenhouse complex, Senie said.
   Companies that have reserved units at the complex include
British Airways, Nichimen of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands,
Senie said. Eighty percent of the units will be rented for hard
currency and the units for Soviets will be rented in rubles.
   The construction is to be managed by Finn-Stroi of Finland,
using Soviet materials where possible and 70 percent Soviet
workers, Senie said. Construction costs work out to about $90 a
square foot; building such a development in the United States costs
about $72 a square foot, he said.
   Zane Yost, the project's architect, said he hopes the
three-story, clapboard-style buildings will demonstrate the latest
housing techniques to the Soviets.
   That he said, could be a reparation for unfortunate housing
ideas that the Soviets once learned from the United States. He said
he asked a Soviet official one time why so much of the country's
post-war housing was in concrete high-rise buildings; the official
replied ``because (Americans) told us to do it that way.

<HEAD>Contel Earnings Down Due to Acquisition Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contel Corp. said Thursday its profit for the
first quarter declined 16 percent, primarily because of costs
associated with its $1.3 billion acquisition of McCaw Cellular
Communications properties.
   The Atlanta-based telephone company said it earned $54 million,
or 34 cents a share, compared with $64 million, or 40 cents a
share, in the first quarter of 1989.Revenue rose 7 percent to $797
million.
   The McCaw acquisition, which involved cellular telephone
operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama, ``reflects our
commitment to pursuing a growth strategy in the personal
communications industry,'' said Donald W. Weber, Contel's president
and chief executive officer.
   ``While the costs associated with the acquisition will affect
near-term earnings, this investment has very attractive long-term
implications,'' he said in a statement.
   The acquisition was completed Feb. 27. Contel said it had
105,420 cellular phone subscribers on March 31, up from 50,050 on
Dec. 31.
   Contel's cellular communications division recorded a loss of $11
million in the first quarter, mostly because of the acquisition
costs, which included interest expense and goodwill amortization,
the company said.

<HEAD>Cheney Proposals Would Hurt Boeing, Major B-2 Subcontractor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposals to cut Pentagon aircraft programs would
hurt Boeing Co. and some of its suppliers, although it's too early
to tell how badly, officials of the aircraft company said Thursday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Thursday outlined to Congress
proposed cuts aimed at saving $34.8 billion through 1997, partly by
purchasing fewer B-2 stealth bombers and delaying the start of
production of Advanced Tactical Fighters.
   Boeing already has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in
the two programs.
   The company is a major subcontractor to Northrop Corp. on the
B-2, with 10,000 employees in the Seattle area working on the
project. It's the largest program for Boeing Military Airplanes and
one of the most significant for the entire aerospace company, said
Military Airplanes spokesman John Kvasnosky.
   Boeing also has 850 Seattle employees working on an ATF
prototype it is developing with Lockheed Corp. and General Dynamics.
   ``I can't speculate in any detail as to what the longer term
effects would be,'' if Cheney's plans for the B-2 are adopted,
Kvasnosky said. However, ``It would mean that we would not
recognize the buildup and growth we had anticipated when we set out
to do this,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, it will have a financial impact on all the
suppliers.''
   Boeing corporate spokesman Russ Young said the company was
examining what effects Cheney's proposals might have on Boeing
employment, but had no immediate estimate.
   Cheney's proposals would start with fiscal year 1991.
   Boeing lost $479 million in its defense and space segments last
year and blamed the poor performance on technical, cost and
scheduling problems. Overall, Boeing had record profits of $4.23
billion on sales of $20.28 billion, mainly due to its booming
commercial airplane business. The company reorganized its defense
operations and predicted it should do better this year.
   Planned purchases of B-2s were slowed in 1989 as Congress and
the Defense Department studied the need for the radar-evading
bomber in light of the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe.
   Boeing cited that delay as a reason for reducing its
164,000-person workforce by about 5,000 for 1990.
   Work is under way up through the eighth B-2, Kvasnosky said,
with another seven planes in the pre-production stage.
   Boeing makes the outboard sections of the wing and the aft
section of the fuselage for the tailless bomber. It also makes the
fuel system, weapons delivery system and the landing gear.
   To date, the B-2 has been worth about $4 billion to Boeing,
Kvasnosky said, adding that the company has invested about $400
million on its share of the program.
   Boeing and the other contractors virtually have completed the
first two prototype YF22-A ATFs, with the first plane to fly by the
end of June. The plane is competing with the YF23-A being built by
Northrop and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The Air Force plans to pick a winning contractor for full-scale
development by May 1991, with a contract award scheduled two months
later.
   Cheney has suggested ATF purchases be delayed from 1994 to 1996.
The number to be bought would remain at 750.
   The ATF prototypes have been kept under strict security,
although the plane is expected to be a heavily computerized, highly
maneuverable successor to the Air Force's F-15.
   The Lockheed team has spent about $600 million on the
prototypes, Kvasnosky said, with Boeing's share ``a couple hundred
million dollars.''
   Boeing is building the wings and the aft section of the ATF
fuselage and is installing the engines, he said. It also is
producing much of the avionics, including the software.
   Costs and the number of employees working on ATF have been
declining because the production work essentially is done,
Kvasnosky said. But if the Lockheed team wins the contract and
production is pushed back two years, ``there would be costs
associated with keeping the program at the simmer level.''

   Chrysler Corp. will build a new sport
utility vehicle in Toledo if it can resolve with city, state and
union officials a number of issues that could cut production costs,
a company official said Thursday.
   The company is looking for an incentives package from the city
and state. It also wants to renegotiate a new contract with United
Auto Workers Local 12. Chrysler's current contract with Local 12
expires in 1992.
   ``Frankly, this is the home of the Jeep. Nothing would be more
appropriate than to have a new Jeep vehicle located in Toledo,''
said Michael Glusac, Chrysler's executive director of governmental
affairs. ``We hope the discussions will eventually make that a
reality.''
   If agreements are reached, Chrysler also will transfer
production of the Jeep Wrangler model to Toledo from Brampton,
Ontario, Glusac said in an interview.
   Chrysler's moves could mean up to 1,600 new jobs at Toledo's two
Jeep plants.
   Under the company's plans, Chrysler would begin producing its
new JJ line in July 1993, creating 700 jobs. The JJ is a $500
million joint venture with Renault, a French automaker.
   Chrysler also would shift vehicle production of the Jeep YJ
model to Toledo from Brampton beginning in July 1992, a move that
could create 900 new jobs.
   Glusac said some of the 1,300 employees at the Brampton plant
would be offered jobs at other Chrysler plants.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter earnings for the nation's Big Three
automakers will be more than two-thirds below last year's profits,
analysts said Thursday.
   The companies are expected to report next week that the drop in
earnings was caused mainly by drastic production cuts in the United
States and economic troubles in Brazil.
   A spot check of analysts Thursday showed forecasts that General
Motors Corp.'s quarterly earnings would be down about 70 percent
from the $1.55 billion the company earned during the first three
months of 1989, which was the best quarter GM had since the second
quarter of 1984.
   Ford Motor Co.'s earnings should be down about 75 percent from
the $1.64 billion the company earned during the period last year,
according to the analysts. Chrysler Corp. may show a marginal
increase from the $351 million in profits it posted during the
first quarter of 1989, the analysts said.
   ``The earnings are going to be almost a yawn,'' said John Kirnan
of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. ``People have been bracing
for the weakened earnings report. The bigger question is when are
we going to get the turn.''
   Auto company executives and industry analysts have predicted
that the first half of the year would be tough and that things
would pick up in the second half.
   ``They'll make more money in the second quarter than they did in
the first quarter,'' said analyst David Healy of Barclays-BZW in
New York. ``In the second quarter, earnings will still be below
last year, but the comparisons won't be as bad as the first
quarter.''
   A rebound in the second half may be delayed, Kirnan said.
   ``The (car and truck) sales numbers have certainly gotten back
into a sluggish territory and with interest rates continuing to
escalate, it may choke off a major turn in second-quarter and
second-half earnings of these companies,'' he said.
   In January, all of the Big Three shut down assembly lines,
temporarily laying off thousands of employees, and pushed
incentives for purchasers _ both drastic moves to shrink bloated
new-car inventories.
   The inventories were brought back to more manageable levels,
which was good for the companies, but the moves apparently
clobbered first-quarter earnings.
   ``A lot of people are saying it will be the toughest quarter of
the year,'' said auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors
Service Inc.
   Chrysler, which has relied heavily on incentives to sell its
cars and trucks, had an aggressive incentive program for its
popular minivans during January. That pumped up sales, but
incentive costs come directly out of profits, and the No. 3
automaker doesn't have overseas operations to prop up any sag in
North American operations.
   During the past year or so, GM and Ford have relied on their
overseas businesses, especially in Europe and South America, to
help maintain profit levels for the entire company. That reliance
soon may end.
   ``A lot of people got surprised by the extent of the damage in
Brazil,'' Ms. Sudol said. ``Everything is at a standstill in
Brazil.''
   In March, Brazil's government froze all accounts. Inflation was
4,583 percent annually at the time. On March 26, Ford and West
German automaker Volkswagen AG shut down production at their
Autolatina joint venture in Brazil and put 2,800 employees on paid
leave.
   Ford spokesman Rex Greenslade said Thursday those workers would
be recalled next Wednesday.
   Ford, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission before the Brazilian government took economic action,
said if current conditions continued, there was potential for a
substantial negative effect on the company's earnings.
   Greenslade declined to comment on whether the employee recall
meant that Ford now has more confidence in the Brazilian economic
situation.

   Debt-burden Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
reported Thursday a smaller loss in the first quarter than a year
ago as its revenue rose 14.6 percent.
   The report of the latest loss comes a day after the publishing
and insurance concern, which sold its theme park holdings last
year, said it was discussing the possible sale of additional assets.
   For the three-month period ending March 31, Harcourt reported it
lost $78.3 million, or $1.07 per share, compared with a loss of
$131.5 million, or $1.80 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $276.9 million from $241.6 million in 1989.
   Harcourt's insurance division posted first-quarter income from
operations of $11.1 million, down from $12.5 million a year earlier.
   But the company's publishing division had a loss from operations
of $28.7 million, compared with a loss from operations of $46.1
million a year earlier.
   Its overall loss from continuing operations fell to $20.2
million compared with a loss from contining operations of $39.2
million a year earlier.
   The company has been struggling under a $2 billion debt incurred
in May 1987 when it underwent a recapitalization to avert a
takeover by British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Peter Jovanovich, president and chief executive officer, said
late Wednesday that the company has begun preliminary discussions
involving the sale of some or all of its existing debt at a
discount, or the purchase of ``certain assets of the company by a
third party.''
   ``HBJ is not for sale,'' Jovanovich said in a statement. ``It is
simply premature to speculate as to whether a transaction will
occur, and, if one does occur, as to its eventual form or terms.''
   The statement followed a report earlier Wednesday that former
U.S. Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who has served for a decade on HBJ's
board, said discussions had been under way with Tomson Corp. of
Canada for a month.
   Harcourt sold its four Sea World parks and two other theme parks
to Anheuser-Busch Cos. for $1.1 billio last September.
   Analysts said Harcourt needed to sell the parks to help pay off
a its debt.

   A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved
the sale of corporate jet maker Learjet Corp. to Bombardier Inc. of
Canada for $75 million in cash.
   The sale by Integrated Resources Inc. also requires Bombardier
to assume liabilities associated with Learjet's continuing
operations, including loans outstanding under the company's $38
million line of credit.
   The deal, which was announced earlier this month, is expected to
close around May 31, Integrated said in a statement.
   The sale was the first major asset disposition outside its major
businesses by Integrated, an investment firm that filed for Chapter
11 protection from creditors in February after defaulting on $1.6
billion in debt.
   Learjet, founded in the late 1950s, makes three light jets and a
medium class model selling for $3.8 million to $7.2 million. It has
2,750 employees and annual sales of more than $250 million.
Integrated acquired Learjet in 1987.
   Bombardier's products include rail transit equipment,
snowmobiles and a heavy business jet called Challenger, which is
manufactured by its Canadair Group and sells for $14 million to $18
million.
   The company has plants in Canada, the United States, Austria,
Belgium, France, England, Finland and Sweden, and employs 22,500
people. Bombardier's annual business volume is more than 2 billion
Canadian dollars.

<HEAD>Judge Partly Dismisses Soybean Suit; Both Sides Claim Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed one count of a lawsuit
Thursday accusing the Chicago Board of Trade of illegally
manipulating soybean prices, prompting the exchange and its
farm-group adversary to claim victory.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge George Marovich means the
American Agriculture Movement Inc. cannot sue the Board of Trade
based on alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.
   But it allows the Washington-based farmers group to proceed with
three other counts in the lawsuit alleging antitrust violations,
breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence.
   The lawsuit stems from the Board of Trade's unusual July 11
order last year requiring traders to reduce their holdings in
contracts for July delivery of soybeans. The result was a steep
drop in soybean prices on the cash and futures markets.
   The Board of Trade, the world's largest soybean futures market,
issued the order to force the Italian company Ferruzzi Finanziaria
S.p.A. to reduce its soybean holdings. The exchange said the large
holdings threatened to cause a sharp, artificial increase in prices.
   Ferruzzi has denied it was attempting to corner the soybean
market.
   The American Agriculture Movement filed its class-action lawsuit
against the Board of Trade and its officers in November. It
contended the emergency order was illegal and caused U.S. farmers
to lose more than $100 million on the value of their soybeans.
   The count dismissed by Marovich _ the first of four counts in
the lawsuit _ declared that farmers, like futures brokers and their
clients, have legal standing to sue the exchange based on alleged
violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. Marovich disagreed.
   The Board of Trade, which had sought to have the entire lawsuit
dismissed, said in a statement that Marovich had dismissed ``the
major count'' of the complaint.
   ``We believe that the court's action is further vindication of
the propriety of our action,'' said exchange Chairman Karsten
Mahlmann.
   Mahlmann noted that inquiries by the federal Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the General Accounting Office had found no
wrongdoing by the Board of Trade.
   But John Arens, a lawyer for the American Agriculture Movement
in Fayetteville, Ark., said the first count was ``a throwaway.''
   Arens said the meat of the lawsuit is in the second count, which
accuses the exchange, its officers and their trading firms of
conspiring to restrain soybean trading and fix prices.
   The third count alleges exchange officers breached their
fiduciary duties and the fourth count alleges they acted with gross
negligence and wanton disregard for market users.
   Marovich said in his ruling he would entertain a motion from the
exchange for a summary judgement, which is similar to a dismissal
but which cannot be made until the case is ready to go to trial.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. received a federal bankruptcy judge's approval
Thursday to hire Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and McKinsey &amp; Co. to
help devise a reorganization plan.
   The two retailing arms of Canada's Campeau Corp. also received
approval to sell a corporate jet for $3.2 million and to provide
data processing for Macy's, the New York-based retailer.
   Shearson will charge $250,000 a month in fees, plus expenses, to
act as financial adviser for an indefinite period, said Cory
Lipoff, a lawyer for Federated and Allied.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said he will review the
contract 90 days after the retailers file their reorganization
plan. The companies have not said when the plan will be filed.
   McKinsey, a management consulting firm, was hired under a
three-month contract beginning May 1 for a fee of $200,000 a month
plus expenses, Lipoff said.
   The advisers are needed to help Federated and Allied come up
with a plan to get out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which
they entered Jan. 15. Federated and Allied listed $7.7 billion in
debt, much of it acquired when Toronto-based Campeau bought Allied
in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   U.S. Trustee Conrad Morgenstern, who is helping the court
administer the reorganization, has complained to Aug that strict
oversight procedures are needed to ensure that financial advisers
and other professionals do not submit exorbitant bills for their
services. Morgenstern said such charges could drain money from the
retailers' estates and reduce their worth for creditors.
   Aug has said he would scrutinize fees to ensure that they are
reasonable. Lipoff said the advisers have promised to submit
documentation to explain their fee charges and what services were
rendered.
   Aug also approved the sale of a Federated corporate jet, a
Lockheed Jetstar II, to an investors' group called W.P.W.
Investments Jetstar. Federated announced 10 days before its Chapter
11 filing that it planned to sell off the Jetstar and three other
corporate aircraft to reduce expenses and raise cash.
   The judge also approved contracts under which the retailers will
provide data processing and information services to three units of
R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. Macy will pay $29 million to Federated and
Allied under a deal that will run for one year, with provision for
a three-year extension if a long-term deal is not negotiated by
then, said Rick Cieri, a lawyer for Federated and Allied.
   The data processing will support billing and credit operations
of Macy's 25-store California division and the San Francisco-based
I. Magnin division, which has 29 stores, spokesmen said. The
retailers also will provide data processing for Macy's 46-store
Northeast division and its New York corporate headquarters, serving
programs for billing, credit, payment of vendors and other
functions, Cieri said.

   Like the entire newspaper industry,
Gannett Co. is mired in a recession that began in the second half
of 1989, the chairman of the communications company told
shareholders Thursday.
   Gannett, whose profits grew along with its increasing size for
22 consecutive years since it became publicly traded company,
``managed to report an up quarter, but barely'' in its first
quarter earnings report last week, Chairman John J. Curley said.
   Curley's comments were made against the backdrop of this week's
American Newspaper Publishers Association meeting, at which news
executives bemoaned a precipitous drop in advertising revenues and
an accompanying decline in readership.
   Most publishers at the Los Angeles meeting attributed the
advertising crisis to regional economic troubles, particularly in
the Northeast. They said declining auto sales along with a
softening in real estate and help-wanted ads contributed to the
general downturn.
   Gannett also has suffered from the downturn in advertising that
started in the Northeast, spread to the South and has not yet
reached the West Coast, company officials said. They were cautious
about prospects for their papers, including USA Today.
   Still, they said they expect USA Today to turn profitable for
the first time in 1990. They also said USA Weekend is approaching
profitability and now carries more ads than its main competitor,
Parade magazine.
   But Curley cautioned, ``We won't really know about the retail
climate until we find out what happens in May and June.''
   He noted that Gannett's stock price rose along with the fortunes
of the company in the first half of 1989, then fell when the
newspaper business turned down in mid-1989. Still, he said, Gannett
remains a good investment for long-term shareholders, with a 17
percent average annual return on a stock purchase since Gannett
went public in 1969.
   Trustees of the Gannett Foundation, whose sole asset is 10
percent of the company's stock, said Wednesday they would put the
block up for sale because Internal Revenue Service rules forced
them to consider diversifying their holdings. The charitable trust
is headed by former Gannett Chairman Allen H. Neuharth.
   Through a spokesman, Neuharth declined to comment on a
Washington Post story that said the proposed sale may indicate a
rift between Neuharth and executives who have run the company since
he left as chairman in March 1989.
   Curley gave up using limousines and the corporate suites
Neuharth had rented in New York and Washington, and the Post said
Neuharth was upset by comments of Gannett executives criticizing
his lifestyle while chairman as excessive and wasteful.
   Curley also declined to comment through his spokeswoman, Sheila
Gibbons, although she said of the Post story, ``I think that's
overreaching.''
   Much of the shareholders meeting was devoted to descriptions of
how Gannett is trying to develop new products as Americans find
less time to read and show less inclination to do so.
   Such strategies include buying the city magazine in Rockford,
Ill., where Gannett publishes the Register Star newspaper, ``to
increase our already strong information and ad picture,'' said Gary
L. Watson, president of Gannett's community newspaper division.
   He said Gannett might buy other such magazines.
   Watson and other Gannett officials also described how the
company had:
   _published a ``talking phone book'' in Florida with access to
news, weather, sports and other information at a toll-free number.
   _put out advertising guides to luxury real estate, also in
Florida.
   _started upscale lifestyle supplements to attract advertisers in
New Jersey and Florida.
   _published a guide with Pacific Northwest tourist information to
be distributed on ferries that sail from Washington state to Alaska.
   _run specials on its television stations built around special
sections in USA Today.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Plans Layoffs Due to Losses at Long Beach Unit</HEAD>

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. will cut 3,000 jobs
this summer, mainly administrators and non-production workers, to
stem losses at its Douglas Aircraft unit, the company said Thursday.
   In its first quarter report last week, the St. Louis-based
aerospace company said it had an operating loss of $84 million at
Douglas Aircraft, twice as big a deficit as in first-quarter 1989.
   Long Beach-based Douglas is home to the MD-80 jetliner and where
the MD-11 jetliner and C-17 cargo plane are being developed.
Employment rose from about 15,000 people in 1984 to 50,000 today as
orders for the twin-engine MD-80 surged and the other planes were
developed.
   ``The bottom line is, we've got to reduce costs because the
performance has not been up to expectations,'' said spokesman John
Thom.
   The layoffs will come primarily from ``staff and support
functions as opposed to the production side of things,'' Thom said.
``An examination will get under way soon to see where people are
needed, what kind of shifting will take place.''
   Thom said the cuts had been under discussion for some time and
were not a reaction to Thursday's proposal by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney to buy only 120 of the C-17 long-range transport planes
instead of the 210 originally planned. The move is designed to save
$11.9 billion over the life of the program.
   The MD-11 and C-17 are nearing the end of their development
phases, and some staff reassignments would have been expected in
any case. The MD-11 is undergoing flight tests and certifications;
the third of the three-engine jumbo jets flew for the first time
Thursday. The C-17 will fly in 1991.
   The company said it would try to transfer some workers who lose
their jobs into production slots, but said an undetermined number
of people would lose their jobs. Workers not only in Long Beach but
in the company's other operations in the United States and Canada
will be affected.
   McDonnell Douglas officials discussed the poor performance at
Douglas Aircraft at the company's annual meeting Monday, but made
no mention of upcoming layoffs.
   Fourteen months after a sweeping reorganization in Long Beach,
McDonnell officials said they're still waiting for results.
   ``We are at bottom,'' said John McDonnell, chairman and chief
executive officer. ``But we really see it as a long-term
investment. We did not expect to see results in 1989. I would
expect we are not going to see 1990 as bad as 1989.''
   Lawrence M. Harris, an aerospace analyst at Bateman, Eichler,
Hill Richards in Los Angeles, said that even though the MD-11 and
C-17 programs are nearing completion, he's not expecting the
problems at Douglas to disappear quickly along with the 3,000 jobs.
   ``Turnarounds in the aerospace industry rarely occur in just one
quarter,'' he said. ``The work in process on a new, complex program
like the MD-11 or C-17 is measured in terms of years.''

<HEAD>B-2 Builder Says Proposed Production Cut Will Hurt Subcontractors
First</HEAD>

   The government's plan to cut production of
the Northrop B-2 stealth bomber nearly in half would hurt suppliers
first but eventually would stunt Northrop's workforce, the company
said Thursday.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Thursday outlined to Congress
proposed cuts aimed at saving $34.8 billion through 1997, partly by
purchasing 75 B-2 bombers instead of the 132 originally planned and
delaying the start of production of Advanced Tactical Fighters.
   Cheney's proposal, predicated on a view of a diminishing Soviet
military threat, helps trim the Pentagon budget by targeting a
program in which each aircraft would cost taxpayers $530 million.
   Northrop employs 12,000 people on the B-2 project, including
about 1,700 who work on assembling the radar-evading bomber in
Palmdale, Calif.
   Stealth bomber subcontractors and suppliers across the nation
employ 30,000 to 40,000 workers, said Tony Cantafio, a Northrop
spokesman.
   Production of five B-2s was proposed in the fiscal 1991 budget
at a cost of $5.5 billion. Under the new plan only two jets would
be built that year.
   ``The immediate effect may be felt by suppliers and
subcontractors around the country,'' said Cantafio.
   ``From an employment standpoint at Northrop, there won't be an
immediate effect.''
   Northrop still will need to hire several hundred more workers
for the Palmdale plant because of prior orders, Cantafio said.
However, Cheney's proposal would halve production in peak years to
12 from 24 aircraft.
   ``Obviously, in the long run we won't build up our employment to
the original schedule,'' Cantafio said.
   Just last Sunday the company ran full-page newspaper
advertisements for a B-2 job fair, using a photograph of the
ominous-looking flying wing and an appeal to many types of
aerospace workers to help ``make history.''
   Northrop also has been running television ads focusing on
employees talking about their work and featuring famed test pilot
Chuck Yeager.
   Building fewer stealth bombers would reduce the program's
projected cost from $75.4 billion to $61.1 billion but would raise
the cost of individual planes to more than $800 million, according
to Cheney.
   Northrop also is competing for a role in a new generation
aircraft known as the Advanced Tactical Fighter, which will replace
the Air Force's F-15.
   Cheney still wants 750 planes built but would push back
purchases two years, from 1994 to 1996.
   The Northrop spokesman said the impact of that change is minimal
because the aircraft is not in full-scale development.

   The stock market ended mixed Thursday despite
buying that carried the Dow Jones industrial average to a
double-digit gain.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.14 to 2,676.58.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
677 up, 764 down and 521 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.33 million
shares, up from 133.48 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 169.11 million shares.
   Activity was moderate on Wall Street where some traders marked
time ahead of potentially market-moving economic data due Friday.
Anxiety about possible interest rate hikes and higher inflation
also kept investors on the sidelines.
   ``I think a lot of investors are looking for something to push
them off the fence,'' said Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president at
First Albany Corp.
   The next test of Wall Street's mood was expected to come Friday
morning with the Commerce Department's first official estimate of
the gross national product for the first quarter of 1990.
   Economists expect the data to show a modest revival in growth,
and quite possiby new stirrings of inflation as well.
   The market got off to a promising start Thursday but by late
morning a broadly based advance bogged down as prices of government
bonds took a beating in the credit market. The widely watched
30-year Treasury bond lost $7.50 for each $1,000 in face value,
bringing its yield back above 9 percent.
   The blue chips managed to maintain a modest rally but had
trouble gaining momentum, daunted by the upward pressure on
interest rates.
   Analysts attributed most of the scattered stock price gains to
buying motivated by upbeat earnings news.
   One of the standouts on Wall Street was Compaq Computer. The
stock climbed 4\ to 98\ after the company reported unexpectedly
strong first-quarter income of $2.13 a share, against $1.95 a year
earlier.
   Another star performer was Bristol Meyers Squibb, which jumped
2&lsqb; to 54~.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2&lsqb; to
70}; DuPont, up 1&lsqb; to 37; and Philip Morris, up &rsqb; to 42&rsqb;.
   Ames Department Stores, which announced it had filed for
bankruptcy court protection from creditors, ended at 1|, up &lsqb;.
   Norton topped the Big Board's list of active issues, falling {
to 88\ as more than 2.58 million shares changed hands.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $6.194 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.36 to 182.66.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index gained 1.38 to 387.89, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index added 0.89 to 332.92.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
0.05 higher to 421.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 344.75, up 0.23.

   The dollar rose against the yen in thin trading
Friday morning and share prices edged higher on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar ended morning trading at 159.10 yen, up 0.33 yen from
Thursday's close of 158.77 yen. After opening higher at 159.43 yen,
the currency traded in a narrow range between 159.05 yen and 159.47
yen.
   The Nikkei stock index rose 69.99 points, or 0.23 percent,
closing the morning session at 29,494.57. The index shed 139.78
points on Thursday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's strength followed its upswing
in New York overnight, where the currency was bolstered by rising
U.S. long-term interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to
support a country's currency.
   ``There were no especially noticeable movements on the exchange
market as many players were making position adjustments,'' said
Masaya Ueno, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   Dealers were taking a cautious stance ahead of the scheduled
announcement later Friday of the estimated U.S. gross national
product for the first quarter.
   Securities dealers said trading remained thin because of next
week's holidays in Japan.
   Japan's ``Golden Week'' series of holidays begins Saturday and
runs through May 6 for most companies. Next week, the stock and
currency markets will be open only Tuesday and Wednesday.
   In the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 85.85 from Thursday's close of
86.09. That boosted their yield to 7.40 percent from 7.35 percent.

<HEAD>Investigation Under Way Over Suspected Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Police said they are investigating a former
president of a finance firm for suspected insider trading, the
first such investigation since Japan tightened laws against insider
trading last year.
   A spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department on
Thursday said the investigation focused on Hironori Mito, 56,
former president of Chiyoda Finance, a medium-sized financing firm
in Tokyo.
   Mito is suspected to have acted on inside information in
purchasing 7,000 shares of Nisshin Steamship Co., a Japanese
shipping operator, in June 1989. The purchase was made a few days
ahead of the company's announcement of terms of a new share
allotment, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   The police spokesman refused to provide further details, saying
only that the investigation had begun.
   An official of Nisshin Steamship refused to comment.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a major Japanese economic newspaper,
quoted Shiro Shikai, chief of the company's general affairs
department, as saying that only Chairman Harunori Takahashi and
three other top officials had known of the allotment of new shares
before the company's official announcement June 16, 1989.
   It was the first such investigation launched by police since
Japan last year enacted a stricter law against benefiting from
inside information in the trading of stocks. The United States had
pressured Tokyo to bring its law in line with those in other world
financial centers.
   Under the new law, enacted in January 1989, those convicted of
insider trading will face up to six months' imprisonment or a fine
of up to 500,000 yen, about $3,160. Previous violations were
treated as civil offenses, though few cases ever came to light.
   Police investigators on Wednesday searched five locations,
including Mito's home, the offce of Chiyoda Finance and a New Japan
Securities Co.'s branch office in Tokyo, where Mito allegedly
bought the shares under a woman's name. Police collected an
unspecified number of documents, the spokesman said.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Finance Ministry investigated
the alleged insider trading last June but failed to find evidence
of insider trading, according to exchange officials.

<HEAD>Walt Disney Net Up 20 Pct in Record 2nd Qtr</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Better results from theme parks, film
entertainment and consumer products gave Walt Disney Co. another
magical quarter, with profits up 20 percent and sales ahead 26
percent.
   In its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, Disney earned
$178.5 million, or $1.29 a share, on revenue of $1.3 billion, the
company reported Wednesday. That compared with earnings of $149
million, or $1.08 a share, on revenue of $1.03 billion in the same
quarter a year earlier.
   The profits and sales figures were the latest in a string of
record results for the entertainment conglomerate.
   Best-ever attendance at the theme parks, combined with higher
per capita guest spending and expanded resort operations, boosted
revenues and operating income in the division, Disney said. The
Disney-MGM Studios attraction in Florida, which opened in May 1989,
was a major draw, it added.
   Theme park operating income rose 14 percent to $194 million and
revenue rose 22 percent to $710 million.
   Home video sales of ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Dead Poets
Society'' and ``Turner and Hooch,'' and the theatrical release of
``The Little Mermaid'' and ``Pretty Woman'' led the film
entertainment results, Disney said. Growth in international
television and home video were key factors, it said.
   Film revenue increased 30 percent to $469 million, with
operating income gaining 40 percent to $58 million.
   Increased merchandise licensing, the success of ``The Little
Mermaid'' sound track and European publishing activities
contributed to a 29 percent rise in consumer products revenue to
$125 million. Operating income rose 24 percent to $59 million.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Disney said profits
rose 19 percent to $353 million and revenue climbed 25 percent to
$2.6 billion.
