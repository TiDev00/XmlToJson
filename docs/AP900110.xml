   Navy Capt. Daniel C. Brandenstein,
chief of the astronaut corps and a veteran shuttle astronaut, is
commander of the shuttle Columbia on its mission to capture an
experiment-laden satellite.
   It is Brandenstein's responsibility to guide the shuttle to
within 35 feet of the satellite, which has been in orbit for nearly
six years, so a robot arm can be extended to latch onto the
spacecraft and pull it in the cargo bay for the trip back to Earth.
   ``It will be like hunting a speck in the sky,'' he said in an
interview. ``But NASA has had plenty experience doing this type of
rendezvous, and Jim (Wetherbee, the pilot) and I have practiced it
to perfection in the simulator.''
   Brandenstein, 46, selected as an astronaut in 1978, was the
pilot of his first trip to space, an August 1983 mission that
launched and landed at night. He commanded his second flight, which
launched in June 1985.
   After his second trip to space, Brandenstein was deputy director
of flight crew operations before being named chief of the astronaut
office at the Johnson Space Center.
   Brandenstein born in Watertown, Wis., earned a bachelor's degree
in mathematics and physics from the University of Wisconsin.
   He joined the Navy in 1965 and became a pilot. He participated
in two combat deployments aboard the USS Constellation and USS
Ranger to Southeast Asia and flew 192 combat missions.
   Brandenstein and his wife, Jane, have a 17-year-old daughter
named Adelle.

   Columbia mission specialist Bonnie
Dunbar has been practicing for years the complicated task of
grabbing a satellite in space and putting it in the space shuttle's
cargo bay.
   Mrs. Dunbar, who has flown on one previous shuttle flight, will
use the shuttle's 50-foot robot to capture the science satellite
that is in danger of falling back to Earth.
   Once she grasps it, she will hold it and turn it frequently for
as long as five hours so other crew members can photograph each of
the exterior experiments to document their condition in case they
don't all withstand the trip back to Earth.
   Mrs. Dunbar, 40, has simulated the satellite retrieval at least
100 times.
   ``I feel comfortable with it,'' she said in an interview. ``I'm
really anxious to see how it really responds on orbit.''
   Born in Sunnyside, Wash., she earned a bachelor's and master's
degree in ceramic engineering from the University of Washington.
She later earned a doctorate in biomedical engineering from the
University of Houston.
   She became a payload officer-flight controller at the Johnson
Space Center in 1978. She became an astronaut in 1981, and was a
mission specialist on a shuttle Spacelab mission in 1985.
   Mrs. Dunbar also is a private pilot and an adjunct assistant
professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Houston.
   Her husband of 1{ years, Ronald Sega, is an electrical
engineering professor at the University of Colorado who is on
sabbatical at the University of Houston.

   Mission specialist Marsha Ivins,
one of three space rookies assigned to the Colombia shuttle flight,
says it is impossible to emotionally prepare for the first trip
into space.
   ``You can't prepare for something you haven't seen or done,''
said Ms. Ivins, 38, an astronaut since 1984.
   But she and the other four Colombia crew members have undergone
intensive training for the mission, simulating the various
objectives of the flight and learning about the experiments on
board.
   Some of her responsibilities include photographing the satellite
that is to be retrieved before it is stowed in the shuttle's cargo
bay. She also will photograph other aspects of the mission as well
as keep track of several experiments.
   Ms. Ivins was born in Baltimore, Md., and received a bachelor's
degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Colorado in
1973.
   She first flew a plane when she was 15 and now holds licenses
for several types of single-engine planes and even has a glider
commercial license.
   She came to the Johnson Space Center in July 1974 and worked
here for 10 years as an engineer before being selected as an
astronaut.

   Mission specialist G. David Low's
desire to become an astronaut developed at a young age while he
watched his father work on the nation's developing space program.
   His father, the late George M. Low, worked with NASA since its
inception in 1958. His positions included chief of manned
spaceflight, manager of the Apollo spacecraft program, deputy
director of the Johnson Space Center, and deputy administrator for
NASA in Washington D.C.
   The elder Low always let his children stay home from school on
the days of NASA's liftoffs and splashdowns, Low said.
   Low said he decided wanted to fly in space when he saw the first
live television from orbit.
   ``I saw the Earth and how pretty it was,'' he said. ``It was at
that point that it wasn't scary to me anymore, and it was in fact
beautiful.''
   Low, 33, born in Cleveland, received a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering from Cornell and a master's in aeronautics
and astronautics from Stanford.
   He worked for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California
Institute of Technology for several years before becoming an
astronaut in 1984.

   Navy Lt. Cmdr. James D. Wetherbee
is making his first trip into space as pilot of the Columbia
shuttle mission.
   Wetherbee, 37, joined the astronaut corps in 1984. He said he
decided when he was 10 that he wanted to be an astronaut.
   Born in Flushing, N.Y., he received a bachelor's degree in
aerospace engineering from the University of Notre Dame.
   Wetherbee joined the Navy in 1975 and became a pilot a year
later. He was assigned to an attack squadron aboard the USS John F.
Kennedy and completed 125 night carrier landings. He also served as
a test pilot before joining NASA.
   He and his wife, Robin, have two children, Kelly, 3, and
Jennifer, 2.

<HEAD>France Reportedly to Reopen Kabul Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News reports Wednesday said France would reopen its
embassy in Afghanistan, becoming the first Western power to do so
since the United States led a diplomatic exodus before the Soviet
army withdrew in February.
   ``France has decided to reopen its embassy in Kabul, closed in
February for security reasons, and to name a charge d'affaires,''
the Agence France-Presse news service reported.
   The news agency said its diplomatic sources did not indicate a
date for the reopening.
   The French daily newspaper Le Monde, quoting unidentified
sources, said: ``The French decision (to reopen the embassy) is not
a political decision. The embassy has been closed since February
1989 because of security reasons.''
   The sources said technical improvements in security allowed the
reopening, but did not elaborate.
   The United States, Britain and other countries withdrew their
diplomatic personnel from Kabul before the withdrawal of Soviet
forces because of fears the capital might be overrun by
anti-government guerrillas.

   A letter was posted in Norway with
only the family name of the addressee on the envelope _ yet
delivered correctly to a family in an English village six days
later, the recipients said.
   ``We are just full of admiration for the Post Office but we
can't imagine how they managed it,'' said Marit Torkildsen of Great
Baddow near Chelmsford, Essex, 30 miles east of London.
   She said an elderly friend wrote ``Family Torkildsen'' on the
envelope and posted it on Dec. 14 from Rjukan in the Telemark
district of southern Norway. It was delivered on Dec. 20, but the
story has only just emerged in the local Essex Chronicle weekly.
   Mrs. Torkildsen's husband, Tore, said: ``Maybe the post office
in Rjukan saw our friend buy the stamp or post the letter and knew
it was for Britain so they put it in the British bag. And maybe
some sorter in London knew the Torkildsens lived in Essex so he put
it in the Essex bag. The whole thing is a mystery to us.''
   Post Office headquarters in London said it knew nothing of the
feat.

   Carl Perkins says he and Dolly Parton
wrote five songs together and sat down to a dinner of beans and
corn bread and fried 'taters when she stopped by for a visit last
weekend.
   ``Dolly said, `Carl, we need to get these songs on an album,'''
Perkins quoted Miss Parton as saying.
   Perkins, who wrote ``Blue Suede Shoes,'' lives in Jackson in
west Tennessee. Miss Parton has a home across the state.
   Perkins said he was a bit hesitant at first when his guest asked
to look at songs he is working on.
   ``I was afraid to let her see how simple my music and my
songwriting are,'' he said.
   But Perkins said his worries were needless and that Miss Parton
suggested he perform on her next album.
   Perkins said his wife, Valda, cooked a home-style dinner for
Miss Parton, who grew up in the Smoky Mountains and likes to boast
of her country roots.
   ``I never saw a megastar enjoy herself more,'' Perkins said.

   Quarterback Randall Cunningham didn't get
his Philadelphia Eagles to the Super Bowl, but members of one
church think he's just super. He stunned them by showing up at
Sunday's services with a $100,000 donation.
   ``They were rejoicing,'' said Elva Smith, who has been a member
of St. John Baptist Church in east Camden for 30 years. ``They
started clapping and singing and praying and thanking the Lord for
someone being so nice.''
   Cunningham, whose team lost in the first round of the National
Football League playoffs, isn't a member of the church. He often
attends services along with teammate Cris Carter, according to
Melvin R. Primas Sr., the church's treasurer.
   The 500-member congregation plans to use the money to expand its
building and for a neighborhood outreach program.

   Japanese soprano Yoko Watanabe is starring in the
Dallas Opera production of ``Madame Butterfly,'' the story of a
geisha who marries an American naval officer.
   The production begins Friday night. It will be the first time in
the company's history that a Japanese singer will perform the role
of Butterfly.
   The opera, in which the American Pinkerton sails away while the
geisha bears their child and awaits his return, is from the Japan
of another era, said Ms. Watanabe.
   When Pinkerton returns _ with his new American wife _ the geisha
commits suicide. A modern Japanese woman would not kill herself
over a faithless man said Ms. Watanabe, who is from Fukuoka, Japan,
and now lives in Milan, Italy.
   ``Essentially, I don't think Japanese,'' said Ms. Watanabe. ``I
think (of myself as) a European lady playing a Japanese lady of old
times.''
   But the quaint ethnicity of ``Butterfly'' doesn't detract from
its popularity in Japan, she said.

   Oliver L. North took issue with
Time magazine's selection of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as Man
of the Decade.
   North, who was convicted in the Iran-Contra affair, told
broadcasters Tuesday that his old boss, former President Reagan,
changed the course of history in Eastern Europe.
   ``The fact is it's a better world today because Ronald Reagan
was president. I do not believe the world is a better place today
because Mikhail Gorbachev was declared by Time magazine to be `Man
of the Decade,''' he told 1,000 people at the Hollywood Radio and
Television Society's Newsmaker Luncheon.
   North recalled that the media reported a decade ago that former
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev said the Soviet Union was on the
march and America was in retreat. Within five years, according to
Brezhnev, the Soviets will be able to impose their will anywhere in
the world.
   ``You reported that,'' North said. ``Yet today, the tables have
turned completely. Why? I believe it's because a Californian gave
us back our future.
   ``Back in 1980 when everything was topsy turvy, Ronald Wilson
Reagan went to Washington and changed the world.''

<HEAD>China Claims Discovery Of World's Oldest Meteorite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese scientists have discovered near the
northeastern city of Shenyang what they say is the world's largest
and oldest known meteorite, an official newspaper said today.
   Geologists estimate the meteorite, known to local farmers as
Huashitai Hill, is 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old and fell to earth
1.9 billion years ago, the China Daily said.
   They said the meteorite mound, located about 12 miles southeast
of Shenyang, is roughly 600 feet long, 250 feet wide and 300 feet
high. It weighs about 2 million tons and is covered with granite.
   The daily said geologists discovered the meteorite in 1984 after
deposits of ferro-nickel ore were detected there. Further
excavation found substances distinctively different in structural
composition and geological age from the surrounding area.
   The scientists found in the area around the granite foundation a
glass-like substance which was formed under high temperatures and
pressure when the meteorite hit the earth.
   Geologists have since found evidence of a large group of
meteorites covering up to 120 square miles in the suburbs of
Shenyang.
   The daily said the meteorite predates the oldest rock
originating on earth, believed to be about 3.6 billion years old,
and its nodular structure is a byproduct of the formation of the
solar system.
   The earth is believed to be bout 4.5 billion years old.
   Study of the meteorite will provide valuable information about
the secrets of the universe, it said.
   A planetarium is to be built on the site and the place will be
declared a state-protected nature reserve.

<TEXT>
   In a former Communist Party
neighborhood headquarters near the center of Bucharest, some proud
old men gather each day to talk about treason.
   That crime and its punishment is a topic these men understand,
perhaps better than anyone else in Romania.
   ``I was accused of high treason, of plotting to take up arms
against the Communist order,'' said 69-year-old Vasile Boaru.
   ``Were you guilty?'' asked a reporter.
   ``Of course!'' laughed Boaru triumphantly.
   Boaru and about a score of other men had come Monday to the old
party building to join The Association of Former Political
Prisoners.
   The organization has enrolled about 1,000 members in Bucharest
since it was founded Jan. 2, days after the overthrow and execution
of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in a popular uprising.
   More are joining the organization every day as the word spreads,
and it is trying to form chapters throughout of the country.
   ``This association proposes to defend the rights of former
political prisoners,'' said Dumitru Secara, an official with the
new organization.
   It wants to push the new government to clear the name of all
former political prisoners and to count their time in prison as
``work years'' toward their retirement, said Secara, 75.
   The association also intends to form action groups to help
entertain and care for former political prisoners too sick to care
for themselves. And Secara said it wants to organize education
programs for the public to dramatize Romania's years of tyranny.
   Secara spent 13 years in prison, from 1949 to 1963, for high
treason. His crime was passing information about the trial of a
dissident to British military officers.
   He recalled being held with two other prisoners in a
1-square-yard cell and of other times when he was chained in a cell
so small he could not sit down.
   Members of the Association of Former Political Prisoners want
the world to also remember there was a Communist tyranny before
Ceausescu's rule. From 1945 to 1964, ``there were about half a
million political prisoners,'' Secara said.
   ``Never again can we accept the idea of Communism,'' said Boaru,
who in October 1947 began 17 years in prison.
   ``Ask these men about the prisons where they treated us like
animals, worse than animals. Where they chained our hands and feet,
where they beat us, and where they didn't give us food.
   ``These Reds weren't men. They were beasts, beasts who slowly
over the years killed thousands of Romanians,'' he said.
   Boaru held out an old newspaper with a short story about his
trial. He and two co-defendants were given lengthy prison terms,
and three others were executed by firing squad.
   ``We want to show by our numbers just how big of a protest there
was against the Communists,'' said member Dumitru Latea.
   Latea, 75, served 15 years in prison after he was convicted in
1948 of taking part in an armed plot against the Communist order.
   Octavian Radulescu, jailed eight years for treason, said he
believes the association gives former prisoners a way ``to restore
the human dignity that was stolen from us until now.''
   ``There can be no more hiding of the truth. This association
will help us bring our feelings out of the dark,'' said Radulescu,
60.
   Boaru agreed, describing the association as a kind of refuge for
men whose lives had been destroyed by tyranny.
   ``I will do everything I can for this association for the rest
of my life,'' said Boaru. ``For me, it will be my home until I
die.''

   Nicolae Ceausescu ordered troops to
fire on protesters at the start of Romania's uprising, and his wife
told soldiers who didn't want to shoot a pregnant woman to run her
down with a tank instead, the interior minister says.
   Interior Minister Mihai Ghitac, the former military commander of
the Bucharest garrison and one of the first generals to side with
civilians seeking Ceausescu's ouster, said in an interview Tuesday
that about 800 armed Ceausescu loyalists had been captured since
the uprising began Dec. 15.
   He also said the army knew the location of the few still at
large and was preparing to close in on them.
   The daily newspaper Adevarul said Tuesday that Ceausescu's
youngest son, Nicu, a former party secretary in Sibiu, southern
Transylvania, personally ordered army and police units to shoot on
revolutionaries in the city last month.
   The dictator and his wife, Elena, were toppled in the popular
revolt, convicted of ``grave crimes'' and executed Dec. 25.
   The stocky lieutenant general's eyes misted with tears as he
spoke of the massacre in mid-December of unarmed demonstrators in
Timisoara, 300 miles northwest of Bucharest _ the atrocity that
unleashed the popular revolution.
   Ceausescu ``gave strict orders to shoot,'' Ghitac said.
``Special units had been sent'' to infiltrate army ranks, ``and
these units provoked general genocide in Timisoara.''
   Mrs. Ceausescu, the virtual second-in-command, was no less
harsh, Ghitac said.
   ``They telephoned the wife of the despot that they could not
shoot because there were women and children,'' he said. ``She was
told over the telephone that a pregnant woman told the soldiers,
`Shoot, and you will kill two people.'
   ``The tyrant's wife said, `If you can't shoot, go with tanks
against them.'''
   He depicted the Ceasescus after their capture and in the final
days as blind to the reality of a Romania impoverished because of
their irrational economic and social policies.
   An interrogator ``asked them, `Why did you leave the Romanian
people without food, children without food,''' Ghitac said. ``The
answer was, `Have you seen anyone die of hunger in Romania?'''
   Government officials last week said about 2,000 Ceausescu
supporters had been detained, but that figure appeared to encompass
those who resisted the army and others who did not fight but were
suspected of serious wrongdoing under the dictator.
   Ghitac also said he intended to open strictly ethnic Romanian
police ranks to members of the Hungarian and German minorities.
   He said this would reduce the resentment by those groups of what
they saw primarily as a force directed against them under Ceausescu.
   Other senior Romanian officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said some police officers recently had been lynched in
parts of Transylvania _ home to most of Romania's 1.7 million
ethnic Hungarians _ by vengeful members of the minority group.
   Ghitac would not comment, beyond saying that some ethnic
Hungarians had ``demonstrated in an extremist way'' recently, and
``we had to move some police to other parts of the country.''
   The minister said an amnesty of political prisoners declared
after the Ceausescus' execution last month extended to those
incarcarated by pre-Ceausescu Communists more than four decades ago.
   It was likely that some of those freed had actually been in
prison for more than 40 years, Ghitac said, adding that he knew of
no examples.
   Ghitac, whose ministry was in charge of all police, spoke from a
spacious office where walk-in closets harbored massive safes left
locked but keyless by his predecessor.
   ``This was Securitate (secret police),'' said Ghitac, suggesting
the safe contained incriminating Ceausescu-era documents, ``but we
don't want to wreck them, unless we have to.''
   The feared Department of State Security, which ran the secret
police, was disbanded after the Ceausescus' downfall.

   With its vindictive police, closed courtroom and
Western outrage, the trial of dissident Sergei Kuznetsov seemed a
throwback to the repression of the Brezhnev era.
   But there was one big difference: Kuznetsov won.
   An appeals court overturned the dissident journalist's
three-year prison sentence Monday and he was free and recuperating
from repeated hunger strikes in a hospital Tuesday, human rights
activists said.
   The action capped a year-long legal battle that turned Kuznetsov
from a little-known dissident in the Ural Mountains city of
Sverdlovsk into the most celebrated victim of human rights abuse in
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union.
   The late Nobel Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov, Western
diplomats and international human rights groups took up Kuznetsov's
cause, barraging Soviet authorities with protests against his
treatment. The underground journal he worked for carried almost
daily reports of his struggle.
   Kuznetsov's victory Monday was only partial: He had been
convicted of libel and resisting police. The appeals court reduced
the libel conviction and threw out the charge of resisting police.
It cut his sentence to less than the time he has already been
imprisoned and accused the police of ``serious mistakes.''
   His case served as a signpost of how far the Soviet Union has
come from its persecution of dissidents under Leonid I. Brezhnev's
regime in the 1960s and 1970s to Gorbachev's vision of a more just
state, ruled by law.
   Kuznetsov's lawyer N.P. Yurchenko told the court in remarks
broadcast on Soviet TV, ``Public opinion in the world and in this
country will judge the progress of perestroika according to the
outcome of this trial.''
   Western diplomats say trials of dissidents are unusual in
today's Soviet Union.
   ``It's impossible to say how many other Kuznetsovs there are out
there,'' said a diplomat who spoke on condition he not be
identified. ``But as far as we know it was the only ongoing case
where someone was being persecuted because they were an active
member of a human rights committee.''
   In an about-face from the scorn they used to display toward
dissidents, the Soviet public and media clearly sympathized with
Kuznetsov.
   State-run TV's Sunday night news program ``Seven Days,''
reporting the latest on Kuznetsov's appeal, asked pointedly, ``What
was Kuznetsov punished for? For crime or for dissent? Isn't there a
hidden political motive here?''
   The progressive newspaper Moscow News branded the judges
``uncivilized'' for handing Kuznetsov, 35, a three-year sentence
when he was so weak from a 34-day hunger strike he had to be
brought into court on a stretcher. ``You must not exchange the
mantle of a judge for that of an inquisitor,'' it said.
   Kuznetsov's saga began when he was arrested in December 1988 at
an unsanctioned rally in Sverdlovsk protesting the detention of
political prisoners, dissidents say.
   A member of the anti-Communist Democratic Union, he had been
distributing leaflets that, according to the Moscow News, accused
the local police chief of being a ``collaborator with murderers and
drowning in corruption'' and the police in general of being
murderers.
   He alleged police beat him in prison, and began a hunger strike
on Feb. 22, 1989, taking nothing but water for weeks. The trial,
which started in April and dragged on until November, appeared
irregular in that it went on behind closed doors and the judge
barred Kuznetsov from the courtroom, saying his behavior was
disruptive. Sergei Kotov, another Kuznetsov lawyer, stalked out of
the courtroom in protest at one point.
   Soviet legal experts say there was no justification for holding
the trial in a closed court, and that violation alone was enough to
require the sentence be canceled. Many observers also considered it
excessively harsh that Kuznetsov was held in custody during the
entire pre-trial and trial period, although it is legal under
Soviet law.
   There also were questions about whether the leaflets Kuznetsov
distributed actually constituted libel in a time when even
Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev has been accused publicly of
corruption.
   Legal expert Alexander Larin said in the Moscow News that it was
difficult to understand how Kuznetsov could be accused of hitting
policemen while, according to the conviction papers, his arms and
legs were held by five policemen.
   The questions festered and the Western and Soviet human rights
advocates continued to press. As 1989 ended, things appeared to
begin to go Kuznetsov's way.
   After two Soviet parliamentarians visited in late December and
said Kuznetsov should be transferred from jail to a hospital, he
was moved, although he remained under guard.
   When his appeal opened last week, the press was allowed to
attend, and ``Seven Days'' commented from the courtroom that public
opinion strongly opposed the three-year sentence.
   Interior Ministry officials said Monday there were no longer any
political prisoners in the Soviet Union. Western and some Soviet
human rights groups continue to dispute that.

<HEAD>Kremlin to British Communist Tabloid: Cancel Half Our Subscription</HEAD>

   The Kremlin has canceled half its standing order
of 12,000 copies a day of Britain's Communist newspaper, the
Morning Star, threatening the survival of the daily that for years
was a faithful friend to Moscow.
   The action by the Morning Star's main customer, to meet
money-saving guidelines under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
economic restructuring, has thrown the 23,500-circulation tabloid
into financial disarray.
   Industry observers believe the 60-year-old newspaper could fold
unless it is revamped radically.
   ``With Moscow refusing to support it, where does it go? I can't
see Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania diving in to fill the
breach,'' said Tony Loynes, news editor of the U.K. Press Gazette,
a British media trade journal.
   ``It's very hard to see how it's going to survive _ without
significant funding of some sort, it's not a viable enterprise,''
he said in an interview Tuesday.
   Chief executive Mary Rosser said the 17-member committee that
administers the newspaper will meet Friday to discuss a strategy
for survival.
   Options include raising the newspaper's 48-cent cover price,
investing in new technology to boost circulation or firing some of
the 80 employees, but a combination of measures is most likely,
Mrs. Rosser said.
   ``It's a crisis, but it's not one that we can't overcome,'' she
said in an interview. ``The paper's history is one of crisis.''
   ``We've got a terrific team who are deeply committed to the
paper, and a devoted readership that's been highly supportive,''
she said.
   The Mezhkniga company _ the distributor in Moscow _ has bought
12,000 copies a day for decades, making the Morning Star one of the
few English-language newspapers available in Moscow during the Cold
War years. On Dec. 25, however, the distributor halved its order
after the Communist Party ordered it to operate on quasi-commercial
lines.
   The company told the Morning Star it has been forced to reduce
its expenditures of badly needed foreign hard currency.
   Copies are flown to Moscow by the state airline Aeroflot and
sold from hotels, kiosks and by subscription to institutes,
libraries and schools where it is used an English-language teaching
aid.
   Another London newspaper, The Independent, reported that
thousands of copies of the Morning Star are dumped unsold.
   In 1984, moderate leaders of the Communist Party of Great
Britain lost a two-year struggle to regain control of the Morning
Star from hard-liners who opposed the party leadership's often
critical stance on matters affecting the Communist countries. The
hard-liners later joined others in forming the breakway Communist
Party of Britain.
   But Morning Star newsroom sources quoted by The Independent said
the Communist daily ``might now shift toward the center, following
the Soviet example'' in an effort to woo new readers.
   The Morning Star will lose an estimated $660,000 of its annual
income of $2.8 million because of the Soviet cut.
   Since 1946, the newspaper has survived partly on a ``fighting
fund'' of reader donations. It is appealing for $25,000 in January
and asked readers to ``bear in mind the urgent necessity for a
blockbuster (donation) every month this year.''
   The newspaper, which marked its 60th anniversary last week, laid
off nearly one-fourth of its print workers in 1986 after a string
of annual deficits including a $500,000 loss in 1985-86.
   Its circulation has dropped from a 1947 peak of 143,000
alongside a parallel decline in membership of the Communist Party.
   The newspaper is the most sober of Britain's tabloids, devoid of
the topless models, sex scandals and bingo games churned out by
some of its rivals, although it does include a two-page sports
section embracing superior horse racing tips.
   Even in a time of turmoil in the Communist world, the Morning
Star's focus is resolutely on Britain. The opening of the Berlin
Wall rated a single column on page one, beside a huge headline on a
local labor dispute.

   The upheavals in Eastern Europe are increasing the
pressure for change in France's troubled Communist Party, whose
hard-line leader and Stalinist views are losing support both in the
party and at the polls.
   George Marchais, the party leader for 17 years, is battered by a
reformist wing within his own party as well by other political
adversaries.
   Among the recent allegations are that Marchais maintained close
ties, including vacation outings, with ousted Romanian dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   When Marchais was a rising star in the mid-1950s, the party
dominated the left in French politics and took a quarter of the
vote. In recent national elections it has been hard-pressed to get
10 percent.
   Party membership, once officially set at 700,000, is now
believed to be less than 200,000.
   Reformers who advocated changes introduced by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev have been purged in keeping with the French
party's Stalinist traditions.
   Like other large Communist parties in Europe, the French party
maintained it saw glasnost coming and prepared for it with
Eurocommunism, a 1970s attempt to reconcile communist orthdoxy with
life in a Western parliamentary democracy.
   But the reformist wing maintains the party has not been able to
adjust to the reality of modern French society, the shrinking of
the blue-collar population that long was its power base, and the
emergence of a high technology, service-oriented economy.
   It would like to fashion left-wing ``rainbow politics,''
reaching out to embrace such issues as ecology, women's rights and
educational reform.
   Editorial cartoons in rightist and leftist daily newsapers have
poked fun at Marchais recently while reporting on the growing
dissent within the party.
   In reply, the Communist daily l'Humanite published two pages of
letters Tuesday from the sackloads it said were arriving each day
supporting Marchais and his policies.
   It also published four pages of pictures of Ceausescu posing
with other French leaders from the left and right, showing that
Marchais was not alone in cozing up to the Romanian dictator.
   In a TV interview, Marchais said he met Ceausescu three or four
times, the last time in 1984 at a meeting of Communist Party
leaders. He said he took a few days off in Romania after those
talks and had not returned since.
   Replying to those who want him to give up the leadership,
Marchais said he had ``no intention of resigning but wanted to work
unremittingly to develop party policies in line with my
responsibilities.''
   Several prominent members of the reformist wing, known as the
renovators, have called for a special party congress to halt the
party's decline, rather than waiting for the scheduled congress at
the end of the year.
   Some reformers say at the last congress in 1987, resolutions
expressing concern about the situation in Eastern Europe were
prevented by party hard-liners from reaching the floor.
   Party rules specify that a special congress can be held if more
than half the members are in favor. ``Let them try and we will
see,'' Marchais said.
   One of the leaders of the reformist wing, Felix Daumette, a
former member of the central committee, said the party cannot
afford to wait until the end of the year if it wants to halt its
decline.
   He said the Communist parties in eastern Euorope that collapsed
came from the same mold as the French party ``and therefore are
caught up in the same failure.''
   The French party must redefine itself and might even have to
consider, as the Italian Communist Party is doing, whether its name
should be changed, he said.

   Edward J. Ennis, a former chairman of the
American Civil Liberties Union and Justice Department official in
charge of enemy aliens during World War II, died Sunday of
diabetes. He was 82.
   As an assistant U.S. attorney, Ennis defended the
constitutionality of President Roosevelt's New Deal legislation in
1932.
   As director of the alien enemy control unit from 1941 to 1946,
he administered internment and other internal security matters but
strongly opposed the internment of about 70,000 Japanese-Americans
early in the war. He later testified on behalf of some of the
detainees.
   Ennis was ACLU general counsel from 1955 to 1969 and president
from 1969 to 1976. During his tenure, he called for the impeachment
of President Nixon and criticized Nixon's pardon.
   Ennis was also at the Justice Department for 14 years, working
as a general counsel to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

   Divers pulled a gun from a river Tuesday, giving
investigators hope they have another piece to the puzzle of the
Stuart murder mystery.
   The registration numbers on the gun recovered from the Pines
River matched those on a pistol reported stolen from the fur shop
where Charles Stuart worked, The Boston Globe reported in Wednesday
edition, citing unidentified sources.
   ``It certainly does look promising as the gun that was allegedly
thrown into the river on the night in question,'' Suffolk County
District Attorney Newman Flanagan said earlier. ``We're encouraged
by the evidence in that it corroborates statements that people have
made to the police.''
   Flanagan said a grand jury would convene Friday to hear
witnesses.
   On Tuesday night, several hundred people gathered at a church in
Mission Hill, the neighborhood where Stuart and his pregnant wife,
Carol, were shot Oct. 23, for a service aimed at easing racial
tensions.
   ``Moving on. That's what the city of Boston is doing here
tonight,'' Mayor Raymond Flynn, who helped organize the ecumenical
healing service, told the racially mixed crowd at Mission Church.
   Stuart, who committed suicide at age 30 Thursday after his
brother implicated him in the slaying of his pregnant wife, had
claimed he and his wife were shot by a black man. A black man was
named as a suspect in the case, but was later cleared.
   Since Thursday, police had searched the Pines River in Revere
for the .38-caliber, nickel-plated, snub-nose revolver.
   Stuart originally told police he and his wife were shot by a
mugger who forced his way into their car when they left a hospital
birthing class. He was seriously wounded. His wife, Carol, died
hours after the shooting, and their premature son, Christopher,
delivered by Caesarean, died 17 days later.
   But Stuart's brother, Matthew, told authorities last week that
he had met Charles Stuart in the area that night and that his
brother passed him his wife's handbag, which contained some
personal items plus a handgun.
   Matthew Stuart, 23, told his attorney he was not aware then that
Mrs. Stuart or his brother had been shot. He took the bag to Revere
and threw it and the gun separately into the river.
   Police recovered the handbag the same day Stuart committed
suicide.
   The gun found Tuesday ``fits the description,'' said Larry
Gillis, a spokesman for the Metropolitan District Commission police.
   Flanagan said the gun would be sent to the FBI crime laboratory
in Washington for tests. Police divers said the gun had begun to
rust.
   Jack DeCourcy, special agent for the FBI in Boston, said it was
possible to detect fingerprints on a gun found in salt water,
depending on how long it was submerged, how rusty it was, and
whether it was found in silt.
   ``It is possible. It'd be difficult, but it's possible,''
DeCourcy said Tuesday.
   A .38-caliber gun was reported stolen from the Boston fur store
where Charles Stuart was a manager, and Flanagan said the weapon
recovered Tuesday was the same type as the one taken from the store.
   Jay Kakas, co-owner of the fur store, issued a statement Tuesday
saying the store's gun was unused and stored in the company safe
for many years. ``It did not occur to me to make any connection
between Chuck Stuart and the gun in the safe until after I heard
Chuck Stuart shot his own wife,'' Kakas said.
   Flanagan said divers would search for other evidence, but he
refused to be more specific.
   ``We're looking for additional evidence to corroborate some
testimony from one of the individuals that has talked to the police
regarding this particular matter,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, publishing houses in New York and Boston are
receiving proposals from writers who want to recount the grisly
tale.
   ``We've heard about at least 10 book proposals being floated,''
James Frost, editor in chief at Warner Books Inc. in New York, said
Tuesday. ``I think everybody wants to know what makes the killer
tick ... what makes a man murder his pregnant wife.''
   He noted the firm's tie-in with film production companies may be
one reason why it has received so many offers.
   Little, Brown and Co. of Boston also has reported several
proposals.
   Police have not disclosed a motive for the crime. Among the
theories being investigated are that Charles Stuart was hoping to
cash in insurance polices, and that he might have been having an
affair with another woman.

<HEAD>Uncertainty Prevails One Month After Aquino Government Nearly Fell</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One month after a bloody coup
attempt, a mood of uncertainty still prevails in the Philippines
despite President Corazon Aquino's moves to reorganize and
revitalize her administration.
   Government and military officials claim the situation has
returned to normal after thousands of military mutineers launched
their nine-day, unsuccessful bid to topple Mrs. Aquino on Dec. 1.
   But rumors of a new coup attempt are widespread and many key
leaders of the latest attempt remain at large.
   A man claiming to speak for the rebels said Tuesday that
mutinous soldiers will try again within a few weeks unless Mrs.
Aquino resigns or promises to close U.S. military bases here.
   ``If she does not step down, we have no choice. ... We will
launch not just another, but we will keep on launching them,'' he
said.
   There was no comment from the presidential staff to the latest
threat, made in a telephone call to The Associated Press.
   Stock brokers say many investors, particularly foreigners, are
staying on the sidelines because of the instability. Occupancy
rates in major Manila hotels have fallen sharply.
   ``It seems the consensus that President Aquino has to do
something dramatic to rally the people behind government in order
to pre-empt anyfuture coup attempts,'' wrote The Business Star in a
recent front-page editorial.
   Faced with the gravest crisis of her nearly four-year
administration, Mrs. Aquino reorganized her 27-member Cabinet on
Dec. 31, removing several secretaries who had been widely
criticized as inept.
   She also announced a reorganization of the presidential staff,
setting up committees of advisers to coordinate between Cabinet
departments and speed up policy implementation.
   It remains unclear whether any reorganization, no matter how
extensive, would deter military rebels who have tried six times to
topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power on Feb. 25, 1986 in a
popular uprising that toppled the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Several key rebel leaders, including former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan, have been involved in previous coup attempts.
   The government shake-up appeared to have been aimed at winning
support from Filipinos who may not have supported the coup attempt
but were disillusioned by rising prices, rampant crime, official
corruption, decaying infrastructure and the slow pace of reform.
   As in the previous attempts, Mrs. Aquino's popularity increased
after the recent failed coup.
   The Social Weather Station polling firm, in a survey of 500
Manila residents last month, found that 43 percent were satisfied
with Mrs. Aquino, a 12 percent increase from before the coup
attempt.
   The survey found that 67 percent opposed the use of force to
redress grievances but that 73 percent believed there was a basis
for the rebels' demands for efficient government and an end to
corruption.
   Some business sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
it will take about six months to see whether the government changes
will be effective.
   But already, many political commentators have expressed doubts
that the shuffle will enhance the effectiveness of an
administration widely criticized as inept and lacking a coherent
national vision.
   ``Changes in her Cabinet, appeals for trust and confidence ...
are not enough to make the feeling of skepticism and uncertainty
now prevailing all over the nation fade away,'' wrote columnist
Nestor Mata in The Manila Standard.
   ``Cory should learn to rise above her own fears, injustices and
suspicions and resentments and act fast,'' he added, referring to
Mrs. Aquino by her nickname.
   Disappointment has been most pronounced among liberals and
leftists who had hoped Mrs. Aquino would usher in a period of
social and economic reform when she took power.
   Instead, most reforms have been in the structure of the
government _ a bicameral legislature, independent judiciary and
liberal legal and constitutional guarantees that are often ignored.
   During the Cabinet revamp, she named a young left-leaning
congressman, Florencio Abad, as secretary of agrarian reform.
   But most other changes reflected the influence of center-right
groups, including business and the Roman Catholic faction led by
Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, archbishop of Manila.
   For example, Mrs. Aquino retained Trade Secretary Jose
Concepcion, widely criticized for high prices, alleged conflicts of
interest and excessive protectionism of selected industries.
Concepcion is prominent in Roman Catholic lay circles.
   ``The mixed reactions of the public indicate the limitations of
the president's choices,'' wrote columnist Fermin Adriano in The
Manila Chronicle. ``Evidently, the new faces in the Cabinet were
chosen to provide a continuation of policies laid down by their
predecessors.''
   At least 113 people were killed in the December coup attempt,
during which U.S. F-4 Phantom jets provided air cover to government
troops.
   Tuesday's caller to the AP, claiming to represent the Reform the
Armed Forces Movement-Soldiers of the Filipino People, asked the
U.S. government to refrain from helping forces in the event of
another assault.
   ``It is the U.S. government responsibility if it chooses to
stick its finger where it does not belong. This is a fight between
the Filipino people and the ruling elite,'' the caller said.

<TEXT>
   A program to try to save the Florida
panther from extinction by breeding them in captivity was
unanimously approved Tuesday by a joint federal-state panel.
   Biologists estimate that only about 50 of the cats roam
undeveloped lands in south Florida.
   Without the program, the Florida panther could be extinct in the
next 25 to 40 years, according to a presentation John Christian
made to the four-member Florida Panther Interagency Committee.
   Christian, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's deputy regional
director for endangered wildlife in Atlanta, said it was possible
the subspecies could be completely wiped out at any time by an
outbreak of disease.
   The captive breeding program's goal is to increase the panther
population to 500 animals _ 200 in captivity and 300 in the wild in
Florida and elsewhere in the Southeast _ by the year 2010.
   Under the plan, eight adult panthers and 18 kittens would be
removed from the wild over the next three years and up to six
adults and 12 kittens would be removed over the following two years.
   Three zoos in Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa have expressed an
interest in participating in the program, Christian said. White Oak
Plantation, a private exotic animal breeding facility in north
Florida, is also interested.
   Christian emphasized that captive breeding would only be a tool
and could not replace management of wild populations.
   ``What we're proposing to do is to take animals out of the wild
to start the core of a captive breeding plan that can be used both
for increasing numbers of Florida panthers in captivity, for
preserving their genetic makeup and then second to provide stock
for reintroductions back into the wild,'' he said.
   As for the wild populations, Christian said the areas had not
yet been decided but that wildlife officials didn't think Florida
alone could maintain three different populations.
   The committee was also told Tuesday that mercury contamination
was a serious threat to the continued existence of the Florida
panther.
   Biologists suspect that mercury has already killed one panther
and know of three other cats who have elevated mercury levels high
enough to be of immediate concern.
   The interagency committee is comprised of officials of the state
Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission, the state Department of
Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Park Service.

<HEAD>Warm January Allowing Farmers to Recover From Christmas Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A respite from holiday cold is hastening
replanting of devastated winter vegetable crops in Florida, but the
vast winter wheat areas of the Great Plains are left without
protective snow cover.
   The government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said
Tuesday that temperatures in the first week of January also ``eased
livestock stress'' over much of the nation, although variable
readings contributed to pneumonia among animals in parts of Iowa.
   ``Lack of snow cover continued to cause concern for winter wheat
producers in the central and northern Great Plains, except for
Montana, where snow cover was mostly good,'' the agency reported.
   In another report, the Agriculture Department said freezing
Christmas weather that ripped into winter vegetable areas of
Florida and Texas was blamed for sharply reduced acreages of
broccoli, celery, lettuce and tomatoes for winter harvest.
   Overall, farmers are expected to have about 191,000 acres of
seven selected winter vegetables for harvest, down 8 percent from a
year ago, the report said. No actual production estimates were
included.
   In Texas, for example, no carrots are expected to be harvested,
although acreages are up in California and Florida.
   Celery for harvest in Florida is down 14 percent from a year
ago, however, and the sweet corn acreage was reported down by 35
percent. The Texas lettuce acreage was reported to be cut 79
percent from last winter, while the Florida tomato acreage is down
32 percent.
   But the Florida harvest of winter strawberries is expected to be
5,400 acres, up 2 percent from last year.
   ``Growers saved most plants from the Christmas weekend freeze by
forming ice caps on plants with overhead sprinklers,'' the report
said. ``The freeze will lower yields because fewer pickings will be
made. Virtually all plants are expected to survive if temperatures
remain moderate for the next few weeks.''
   Looking at the carrot situation, most of Florida's crop was
destroyed, although growers ``are expected to replant most, if not
all, of the lost acreage,'' the report said. Part of the severely
damaged crop in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas may be salvaged by
hand harvesting ``if the price is high enough.''
   Department analysts have said that although citrus and fresh
vegetable prices are expected to rise in the first quarter, overall
consumer food prices in 1990 are still expected to go up a modest 3
percent to 5 percent, compared with 5.7 percent in 1989, the
sharpest gain since 1981.
   One reason is that vegetable fields can be replanted quickly so
that there's a minimum lag in supplies, they said.
   The report by the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said
Florida vegetable farmers enjoyed warm weather in major producing
areas in the first week of the new year.
   ``Planting and replanting was active under nearly ideal weather
conditions,'' the report said. ``Harvest continued, but supplies of
most crops were reduced.''
   The facility, which is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments, said freeze damage in Texas ``became more evident'' in
the Rio Grande Valley.
   ``Lettuce and celery were severely damaged, and onions also
suffered some loss,'' it said.

   The Soviet Union has begun to use a renewed

   Officials said Tuesday that Moscow bought 480,000 metric tons of
wheat for delivery next month under a long-term grain-supply
agreement.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said 10 private companies shared in
the sales.
   The wheat was sold under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which provides subsidies to exporters selling U.S.
commodities to designated foreign markets.
   Dickerson said 1,534,200 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation. A new purchase line of 2 million
tons was announced Dec. 19, in addition to 14,200 tons remaining in
a previous allocation.
   Only wheat has been approved for sale to the Soviet Union under
the price-subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began Oct.
1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought about 1.3
million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 11 million
tons of corn, plus some soybeans and soybean meal. All of the wheat
was sold under EEP arrangements.
   In the sixth year of the agreement, the Soviet Union bought
about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million tons of
corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. All but about
700,000 tons of the wheat was bought under EEP.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 480,000 tons are equal to 17.6 million bushels worth
around $67 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $20.50 per
ton, or about 56 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Dickerson said the 480,000 tons of wheat were sold by Alfred C.
Toepfer International Inc., 100,000 tons; Harvest States
Cooperatives, 80,000; Bunge Corp., 50,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp.,
50,000; Ferruzzi U.S.A. Inc., 50,000; Union Equity Cooperative
Exchange, 50,000; Cargill Inc., 25,000; Continental Grain Co.,
25,000; J. Aron &amp; Co., 25,000; and Mitsubishi International Corp.,
25,000.

   Democracy in Latin America is at an all-time
high with strong encouragement coming from the United States, but
American officials acknowledge that only rarely has there been less
support in the hemisphere for U.S. policies on key issues.
   The United States has been in the minority in the last three
weeks on two votes by the Organization of American States
criticizing the U.S. invasion in Panama.
   U.S. officials are worried the drug summit President Bush is
expected to attend next month in Colombia may be overshadowed by
complaints about the more assertive American stance recently.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler conceded Tuesday
that leaks about a proposed U.S. anti-drug interdiction effort off
the Colombian coast have complicated the hope of enlisting
Colombia's cooperation in the initiative.
   Word of the proposed effort, coming days after the U.S. invasion
of Panama, has touched off rumors around the hemisphere that the
United States may try to blockade Colombia or perhaps even invade
as an encore to the Panama intervention.
   U.S. officials scoff at such suggestions.
   An OAS resolution two days after the Panama invasion expressed
regret over the action. Monday night, the United States again was
in the minority as the OAS voted to criticize as a violation of
international law the Dec. 29 incursion by U.S. troops into the
Panama City residence of the Nicaraguan ambassador.
   The administration complained that in view of the U.S. admission
that a mistake had been made, the OAS meeting served no purpose
other than anti-U.S. propaganda.
   Curiously, the rallying of hemispheric opinion against the
United States is occurring as the ranks of countries adhering to
democratic principles has never been greater.
   In the U.S. view, dictatorial rule in Panama ended with the
installation of President Guillermo Endara an hour before the U.S.
invasion began. Endara was widely seen as the winner of the May 7
election, which Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega annulled rather than
surrender power.
   Six days before the invasion, Chile laid the groundwork for a
formal end to 16 years of military rule with the election of a
civilian president who will take office in March.
   That leaves only Cuba and Haiti without multiparty systems,
among hemispheric countries, although officials acknowledge that in
some nations the democratic process is not fully developed.
   U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, are worried the drug
summit scheduled for Feb. 15 in Cartagena, Colombia, may get bogged
down by Latin complaints over U.S. policies.
   Peru was angered earlier this week by the deployment of U.S.
troops around its embassy in Panama City as part of a search for
Noriega loyalists. In addition to the U.S. and Peru, the scheduled
summit participants include Colombia and Bolivia.
   The most immediate source of concern for the administration is
Colombia, where nationalistic sentiments are raising doubts about
the ability of the United States to win that country's cooperation
in an anti-drug crackdown.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is expected to make final
proposals to Bush on use of a U.S. aircraft carrier group off the
Colombian coast to monitor drug trafficking operations.
   As evidence of Colombian reluctance to cooperate, Colombian
officials reportedly refused to meet with a U.S. team last week to
discuss the issue.
   Asked whether the furor in Colombia has left the administration
embarrassed, Ms. Tutwiler said Tuesday:
   ``We're not embarrassed, but it certainly has complicated the
consultation process.''

<HEAD>IRS Makes a Little Mistake</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was just a little printing error, but as
many as 566,000 couples and individuals have been told to send
their federal tax returns to the wrong address.
   It's no big deal, says the Internal Revenue Service, and it
won't delay refunds.
   ``This shouldn't present a problem for the IRS or for
taxpayers,'' IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said Tuesday.
   In fact, Pyrek said, if you are one of the Form 1040 filers who
received the wrong envelope in your tax-instruction package, you
may use it as is, correct it or substitute an envelope of your own.
   The IRS says the problem apparently affects only about 0.5
percent of the 107 million tax-return packages mailed out last
month. Specifically, the wrong envelopes were included only in some
of the kits marked ``Package 1'' in the lower right corner of the
cover, which contain only a 1040 and Schedules A (for deductions)
and B (for interest and dividends).
   The problem has not shown up in 1040A or 1040EZ packages.
   The IRS isn't sure why it happened, but says the improper
envelopes apparently originated with one of the several private
printers it hires to produce the tax-instruction packages.
   ``We think there was some kind of problem in the list the
printer used to stuff the envelopes into the packages,'' Pyrek
said. ``It's not clear to us yet.''
   The IRS believes the problem envelopes are spread out among
taxpayers in eight of the 10 regions. So far, the agency has heard
of no problem among taxpayers served by the Ogden, Utah, service
center (all the West except Southern California, Hawaii and New
Mexico ) or the Memphis center (Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee).
   How do you know whether the envelope in your package has the
wrong address? Check the list of service-center addresses on page 5
of the 1040 instructions.
   Pyrek said a taxpayer who received a mis-addressed envelope may:
   _Use another envelope.
   _Use the IRS envelope but mark out the wrong address and the
Postal Service bar code.
   _Use the IRS envelope, wrong address and all. That won't delay
any refund, Pyrek said.
   Errors are not unknown at the IRS, which produces nearly 100
different individual tax forms and schedules and dozens of
publications to explain them. Already this year the IRS has
corrected a goof on Form 2441, which parents use to claim a credit
for child-care expenses.
   The form as mailed to taxpayers included a sentence on line 6
reading:
   ``If the result here is zero or less, stop here; you cannot
claim the credit.''
   That sentence should read:
   ``If the result is zero or less, skip lines 7 through 11, enter
zero on line 12 and go to line 13.''

<HEAD>U.S. Eases Restrictions on Polish Diplomats' Travel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's diplomats no longer must ask the
State Department each time they want to travel from Washington to
their diplomatic missions in Chicago and New York.
   The relaxation of the travel restrictions, which went into
effect last month, is a response to the demise of communist rule in
Poland, the State Department said Tuesday. Poland last year
installed a government led by the independent Solidarity trade
union.
   Similar restrictions on U.S. diplomats in Poland were also
eased, the department said in response to a question.
   The United States is considering easing travel restrictions for
diplomats from other Eastern European countries that have been
taken over by reformists in recent months, officials said.
   ``We have spoken to the State Department about this, and they
told us they have to consult with other parts of the government but
that it could happen,'' said one Eastern European diplomat who
asked not to be named.
   A State Department official, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was too early to lift travel restrictions on all
Eastern European diplomats, ``but we might see some relaxation.''
   Limitations on diplomats are generally imposed on a reciprocal
basis. In other words, when the Soviets curtailed the movement of
American diplomats, the United States did the same here. The
restrictions also help the FBI monitor the movements of Soviet bloc
diplomats.
   Until now, Polish diplomats were required to arrange all their
trips within the United States through the State Department and to
give notice of their intention to travel two working days in
advance.
   Under the new policy, they may travel between Washington, New
York and Chicago without notifying the State Department.
   Most Eastern European diplomats in Washington, except
Hungarians, are subject to similar restrictions, although the
ambassadors are exempt.
   Restrictions are tougher for Soviet diplomats, who are confined
to within a 25-mile radius of Washington. If they want to go beyond
that limit, they must notify the State Department.
   Eastern European and Soviet diplomats at the United Nations are
also banned from traveling beyond a radius of 25 miles.
   The State Department announced last month that it would grant
permanent building passes to Polish and Hungarian journalists who
regularly cover the State Department. Previously, those reporters
could only enter the building with an official escort.

<HEAD>Bush Budget Won't Have S&amp;L Financing Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's fiscal 1991 budget
will be released later this month without a plan for financing the
bailout of the savings and loan industry, officials say.
   How and when the bailout financing is done will be a crucial,
perhaps the crucial, element in determining how easily the
administration meets the $64 billion deficit target under the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   The administration told the House Ways and Means Committee in
November that it intended by Jan. 15 to formulate a plan to borrow
$50 billion to $100 billion for S&amp;Ls.
   Although officials have narrowed the financing options to just a
few, they will not be able to meet that deadline, three
administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday.
   The key question is how much of the financing will count toward
the deficit. Officials hope to resolve the matter within 60 days,
but a decision will not come in time for the Jan. 29 release of the
fiscal 1991 budget.
   Two officials said the administration is likely to combine
several financing methods, leaving part of the financing ``on
budget'' and part ``off budget.''
   One official said the bulk of the financing likely will be ``on
budget,'' meaning the borrowing would balloon the budget deficit.
However, the other said the administration would retain
considerable flexibility to shift back and forth between on- and
off-budget methods.
   Legislation enacted in August provides $50 billion through
fiscal year 1992 for the Resolution Trust Corp., an agency created
to dispose of about 600 failed thrifts.
   However, the agency needs to borrow an additional $50 billion to
$100 billion in ``working capital,'' which would be repaid when it
sells off the bad loans, real estate and other assets owned by the
bankrupt S&amp;Ls.
   The budget document will discuss working capital, but will not
resolve the issue, according to one official. Another official said
at least one financing option has been eliminated: chartering a new
off-budget agency to raise cash by selling short-term notes to
investors.
   The administration still is considering borrowing from the
Federal Home Loan Bank System, a quasi-public system of 12 regional
banks created to provide low-cost funds to savings and loans. That
wouldn't count on the budget.
   Additional cash could be raised on-budget through the Federal
Financing Bank, a government entity through which agencies such as
the Postal Service and General Services Administration borrow
money. However, it is unclear whether the RTC can legally tap this
resource.
   The effort to remove the legal obstacles to Federal Financing
Bank borrowing and the need to negotiate with Federal Home Loan
Bank officials has delayed the working capital plan beyond the
original Jan. 15 deadline.
   If the RTC cannot use the Federal Financing Bank, another
alternative would be a direct line of credit through the Treasury.
However, that would require approval from Congress, which would
likely sharply limit the borrowing, something the administration
wants to avoid.
   If the administration eventually settles on mostly on-budget
financing, it could complete most of the borrowing before Sept. 30,
inflating the deficit in the current fiscal year, for which
Gramm-Rudman deadlines have expired. Then, as S&amp;L assets are sold,
the revenue would reduce the deficit, probably by a small amount in
1991 and then by a huge amount after that.
   ``The revenue gains would make the peace dividend look like
peanuts,'' one official said.
   As an adjunct to working capital borrowing, the administration
is considering creating a centralized brokered deposits desk for
failed S&amp;Ls. The 281 S&amp;Ls under government control rely on about
$13 billion in high-cost deposits placed by money brokers.
   The administration hopes to act as its own money broker and
lower the cost of those deposits. It would hope to attract sums
from institutional investors in the tens of millions of dollars and
then split the money into insured $100,000 chunks and divide it
among its failed S&amp;Ls.
   In a pinch, the brokered deposits operation could be expanded to
serve as the source of working capital, one of the officials said.
When failed institutions were sold to new investors, the RTC could
retain a shell institution in its portfolio that would consist of
bad assets and brokered deposits. The deposits would be paid off as
the retained assets were sold.

<HEAD>NBC Wins Ratings and Top Two Places Go To Cosby and `Cheers'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied
for first in the Nielsen ratings for last week after playing second
string to football the previous week.
   None of the post-season bowl games were in the top 10 last week,
and several ranked near the bottom of the ratings. Football
dominated the ratings the previous week.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was third in a week that began to look like
normal again. CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote'' made it
back into the top 10. CBS' ``Designing Women,'' which had a
one-hour special episode with guest star Dolly Parton and featured
the birth of Charlene's baby, was No. 10.
   The highest ranked football game last week was NBC's coverage of
the Colorado-Notre Dame game in the Orange Bowl, which tied for
12th.
   NBC's coverage of the American Football League playoff between
Pittsburgh and Denver got a higher rating for its run over into
prime time on Sunday. The game, however, was not on the official
Nielsen list. NBC and CBS listed the run over as 12th and the
Orange Bowl as 13th, but the pro game was not listed by ABC.
   NBC handily won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week, and
CBS regained second place. The network averages: NBC 15.8, CBS
13.4, ABC 12.1. A ratings point represents the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned to a show.
   Season to date, NBC leads with an average of 14.8 to ABC's 12.9
and CBS' 12.2.
   Here's the top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied;
ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``The Golden Girls''; CBS' ``60
Minutes''; NBC's ``A Different World''; CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'';
NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years'' tied; and CBS'
``Designing Women.''
   CBS' ``Murder in Black and White,'' the third movie with Richard
Crenna in the same role as a New York police detective, was 20th.
Its Sunday competition, the first part of the two-part NBC
miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story'' was in a three-way tie
for 34th.
   Two police shows debuted last week. ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' was 46th and CBS' ``Max Monroe: Loose Cannon'' was 58th.
   Here's the standing for the other bowl games: ABC's Rose Bowl
tied for 28th, NBC's Fiesta Bowl 61st and ABC's Sugar Bowl 75th.
   CBS won first place among the evening news shows after a long
winning streak by ABC's ``World News Tonight.'' ABC trailed in
second place by a tenth of a point. ``The CBS Evening News'' was on
five days last week, while ABC and NBC did not have Monday shows on
New Years Day. The ratings: CBS 12.0, ABC 11.9, NBC 11.0.

   Civil rights leaders are applauding President
Bush's strong vocal support of racial justice and equality, but
they're urging him to back up his words with billions of dollars to
alleviate poverty in inner cities.
   On Tuesday, as Bush gathered civil rights activists at the White
House to watch him sign a Martin Luther King Jr. birthday
proclamation and denounce a wave of hate bombings in the South, the
National Urban League released a bleak report on ``the state of
black America.''
   The league proposed cutting the $300 billion defense budget in
half, using $100 billion to cut the deficit and $50 billion to
launch ``an urban Marshall Plan'' to reclaim America's cities and
urban poor.
   ``The end of the Cold War must mean the start of a renewed drive
to bring America into the 21st century by investing in its people
and its economy,'' said league president John E. Jacob.
   The $50 billion is needed, Jacob said, for housing, health care,
education and other needs.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said America still must
maintain a strong defense. Even without fiscal restraints, she
added, it would be hard to come up with the sums the National Urban
League cited.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, had measured
praise for Bush's record on civil rights.
   After eight years of the Reagan administration's being ``very
`anti' as it relates to civil rights,'' Hooks said, ``this present
administration, I think, has moved cautiously and judiciously in
the field.''
   Bush ``has made many very excellent statements and in the next
few months we will be moving to get him to go further on it,''
Hooks said.
   Bush spoke movingly of Martin Luther King Jr. as he signed the
proclamation declaring Monday a holiday, as it has been since 1986,
after President Reagan dropped his opposition.
   It would have been the 61st birthday of the civil rights leader,
struck down by an assassin's bullet in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
   Bush called King ``a force against evil. His life was a metaphor
for courage.''
   ``Wherever he found hatred, he condemned it. Wherever there was
bigotry, he assailed it. And wherever there was segregation, he
defied it,'' said the president.
   ``He endured death threats and these obscene phone calls in the
dead of the night and he refused to be intimidated. Through his
courage, Dr. King changed forever America for the better,'' Bush
said.
   ``When we hear of bombings, obscene phone calls, hate mail, each
one of us must speak out,'' Bush said. ``There is no place for
bigotry in the United States of America.''
   A person or group calling itself Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System claimed responsibility for killing U.S.
Circuit Judge Robert Vance on Dec. 16 at his home outside
Birmingham, Ala., and Robert Robertson, a Savannah, Ga., lawyer and
civil rights leader, two days later. Federal authorities
intercepted bombs intended for the federal courthouse in Atlanta
and a Jacksonville, Fla., NAACP office.
   ``This administration will not let up in the fight against
racism,'' Bush said. ``We will work to bring the perpetrators of
these hideous crimes to justice.''
   Hooks emerged from the Oval Office saying he was ``fairly
satisfied'' with federal efforts to solve the bombings, but was
seeking further assurance that the ``sense of urgency'' extends to
the FBI and Justice Department, as well as the White House.
   ``We did not ask for any federal protection and he did not offer
it,'' said Hooks, adding he is not interested in leading a
``straitjacket life.''
   Civil rights groups have complained of Bush's support for recent
Supreme Court rulings limiting affirmative action, and they helped
torpedo his nomination of a Michigan sheriff, William Lucas, to the
Justice Department's top civil rights post. Lucas, now a liaison
official at Justice, attended the signing ceremony.

   Mayor Marion Barry says a reporter who
portrayed him as combative and denigrating Jesse Jackson was
motivated by racism.
   Barry lashed out Tuesday at Los Angeles Times reporter Bella
Stumbo, alleging in a letter to the newspaper that her profile
published in Sunday's editions ranged ``from prejudicial opinion to
total falsehoods, and slings mud along the way.'' He demanded an
apology.
   Ms. Stumbo could not be reached for comment.
   ``The story was a balanced and perceptive portrait of the mayor
as he revealed himself over 18 hours of interviews,'' C. Shelby
Coffey III, editor and executive vice president of the Times, said
in a statement. ``The story is fair and speaks for itself.''
   The newspaper said it had tape-recorded Barry's comments.
   Barry was quoted in Ms. Stumbo's story as saying Jackson, the
two-time presidential candidate supported by Barry, ``don't wanna
run nothing but his mouth.'' The paper also quoted Barry as saying
Jackson would become ``the laughingstock of America'' if he ran for
mayor of Washington, a topic of speculation in the capital.
   The mayor's comments, according to the Times, came as Barry sat
late one night in November sipping wine in a bar with Ms. Stumbo.
   In his letter, Barry said the reporter had told him she wanted
to learn whether there was racism against black mayors.
   ``She said she wanted to look at racism. She did, all right _
through her own prejudiced eyes. She looked at it and embraced it
fully,'' he said.
   As for the comments attributed to him about Jackson, the mayor
said, ``I know I did not use the words Ms. Stumbo put into my
mouth.'' He added, ``In no way did I denigrate'' Jackson.
   Barry also denied using what he called the ``black dialect''
attributed to him in the interview.
   ``People who do not know me would think I leaped from the screen
of an Amos and Andy show,'' he wrote, referring to an old radio and
television series considered offensive by many blacks.
   Jackson said Monday that he had accepted Barry's assertions that
he did not make the statements attributed to him.
   But, sources close to Jackson said the newspaper assured him
that there are tape recordings of the interviews.
   Barry has criticized the media for the nationwide attention
given to his relationship with convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis
since it was reported that Barry visited Lewis several times in a
Washington hotel.
   ``I've told him more than once that The Washington Post didn't
put him in that hotel room with that drug dealer,'' says lawyer Max
N. Berry, who chaired Barry's 1986 re-election effort. ``He gets
himself into this trouble, and then he wants to turn around and
blame the people who write about it.''
   Lewis pleaded guilty in November to drug conspiracy charges and
testified under oath that he supplied Barry with cocaine. As part
of his plea bargain agreement, Lewis is cooperating with
prosecutors who continue to probe his ties to the mayor.

<HEAD>Even Bureaucrats Confused by New `Group of 24'</HEAD>

   Even people who understand groups of
governments known as ``G-5,'' ``G-7,'' ``G-10'' and ``G-77'' are
having trouble with the new ``G-24'' _ there are two of them, they
do different jobs and they have different member countries.
   The new ``Group of 24'' met last month in Brussels, Belgium, to
help the governments of Eastern Europe move away from communist
systems toward private enterprise. It includes the United States,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the countries of Western Europe.
   The old ``Group of 24'' was drawn from the Third World and
usually meets in Washington. It first came together in 1972 with
countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America. The present chairman
is Finance Minister Jean-Pierre Lemboumba-Lepandou from the western
African republic of Gabon.
   Christian Obame, speaking for the old G-24, says the new group
may seem to slight the Third World gathering.
   ``It bothers us some,'' he said. ``It seems to be putting us off
to one side. We'll have to find out just what it's going to do.''
   Obame is a permanent representative of Gabon at the headquarters
in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and its sister
organization, the World Bank. He said Gabon's finance minister will
raise the question of the two G-24s at the end of the month when
many of the world's financial leaders meet in Washington.
   The old G-24 has essentially represented Third World needs to
the more prosperous members of the bank and fund, members who make
up the new G-24.
   Though this meeting of the fund's Interim Committee has not yet
been officially set, it is expected to be needed for a decision on
how much to increase the $117 billion the IMF has available for
lending. Much of the increase would be made available to Eastern
Europe, in return for promises of new economic policies.
   Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, toured Africa
after attending the meeting of the new G-24 to assure senior G-24
members that their needs would not be forgotten in the effort to
help Warsaw Pact nations.
   All the members of the old G-24 belong to the Third World's
G-77. But don't be misled by the title: the G-77 has 129 member
countries.
   Other groups are smaller and more powerful. The G-5 _ the United
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain and France _ has long taken on
the major financial and economic decisions, often meeting in secret
at dinner.
   Those are the nations that agreed in 1985 in New York to drive
down the price of the dollar. Usually the member governments are
represented by the U.S. secretary of the Treasury and the other
countries' ministers of finance.
   Italy and Canada joined those nations in a separate grouping to
make up the Group of Seven. Some experts think the G-5 still makes
the major decisions and brings the other two in later.
   The G-10 includes the G-7, plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland. That makes 11, since Switzerland joined in 1984,
but the old name is still kept. It was set up in 1962 under the IMF
to lend the fund extra money when needed.

<HEAD>Prosecutor May Bring Temper, Flamboyance to Noriega Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is trying to deal with
the thorny problem of whether the flamboyant U.S. attorney in Miami
will be the lead prosecutor at Manuel Antonio Noriega's drug trial,
sources say.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, known among Miami lawyers and
Justice Department officials for his volatile temper, has said
through spokeswoman Diane Cossin that he plans to lead the
prosecution team.
   But Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said no decision
had been made about who will be the lead prosecutor. The
government, Runkel said, will be ``well represented.''
   Ordinarily, it would be Lehtinen's prerogative to try the case
because the Justice Department would be reluctant to tell a U.S.
attorney how to run his office.
   But Lehtinen is a court-appointed U.S. attorney who is being
considered by the White House for a four-year appointment, subject
to Senate confirmation.
   Runkel said Lehtinen's background check by the FBI has been
completed and that he expected his name would be forwarded to the
White House for final consideration.
   But an administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Justice Department may offer Lehtinen the
choice of prosecuting Noriega or running the U.S. attorney's
office, which oversees federal cases in south Florida.
   No decision has been made, the official said, but the department
is concerned that Lehtinen would have difficulty running a large
office and overseeing such a potentially complex case.
   The Justice Department may also consider Lehtinen's reputation
for having a volatile temper, including his feuds with law
enforcement officials and theatrics such as waving a plastic
assault rifle during a staff meeting on drug traffickers.
   Runkel declined to comment.
   ``I am not going to get involved in speculation about how the
case is going to be presented in court,'' he said.
   The Noriega case is expected to last more than a year, with
complicated pre-trial motions involving defense requests for
sensitive government documents covering the deposed Panamanian
leaders's career as a CIA informant.
   Another government source said senior Justice Department
officials were well aware of Lehtinen's reputation as having a
volatile temper.
   Lehtinen publicly spurned an offer by the former prosecutor who
put the Noriega indictment together two years ago to assist in the
case.
   The prosecutor, Richard Gregorie, was Lehtinen's rival for the
U.S. attorney's job in 1988 after the resignation of Leon Kellner.
   Lehtinen is described by Miami lawyers who once worked in the
office as a very short-tempered man who enforces a military-style
chain of command.
   One former senior prosecutor in the Miami office, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Lehtinen alienated many career
prosecutors and has openly feuded with federal law enforcement
agencies about policy matters.
   ``Essentially he treats everybody like infantry,'' said the
former prosecutor, now in private practice. ``They're just some
very talented people treated like infantry.''
   During one staff meeting, Lehtinen waved a plastic AK-47 while
giving prosecutors a pep talk about fighting drugs, according to
published reports confirmed by the former prosecutor.
   A Florida native who graduated at the top of his law school
class at Stanford, Lehtinen was an organized crime strike force
prosecutor in Miami before going into private practice and later
running for the Legislature.
   His wife, Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, won a special election
in August for the congressional seat left vacant by the death of
Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   The administration official noted the choice of prosecuting
Noriega or getting a full-time appointment as U.S. attorney might
be a difficult one for Lehtinen.
   Prosecuting Noriega could be a feather in the cap of someone
with political ambitions, the official said.
   Robert Merkle, former U.S. attorney in Tampa, ran unsuccessfully
for the Senate in 1988 after successfully prosecuting Colombian
cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas.

<HEAD>6-Foot, 7-Year-Old Soviet Boy Undergoes Pituitary Tumor Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgery to stop the rapid growth of a
7-year-old Soviet boy who stands 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds
appears to have gone well, but surgeons say he may need more
treatment.
   In a three-hour operation Tuesday at the Mayo Clinic's St. Marys
Hospital, doctors removed all that was apparent of a large tumor on
Igor Ladan's pituitary gland.
   But surgeons said some cells of the tumor, which had resulted in
an overproduction of growth hormone, may remain, and additional
medication or radiation therapy may be needed to lessen the
likelihood that the tumor will grow back.
   Igor came to the clinic with his mother, Svitlana Ladan, in
September from their home in the Ukrainian city of Kiev following a
worldwide search for doctors who could treat the rare tumor.
   The tumor had risen up out of the pituitary gland and was
pressing on the brain, the clinic said in a statement.
   Doctors first used drug therapy to reduce the tumor by about 30
percent, then decided to operate when tests showed no further
reduction in the tumor's size, said Dr. Donald Zimmerman, a
pediatric endocrinologist who is part of the team treating the boy.
   Some of the possible complications from the surgery include
serious bleeding, blindness or vision loss and stroke, the clinic
said.
   ``Tumors similar in size to Igor's tend to grow around arteries
and vital structures of the pituitary making complete removal of
the tumor difficult or impossible,'' the clinic said.
   Mayo Clinic physicians have treated more than 60 children with
pituitary tumors.

<HEAD>Maine Board Rejects Plans to Release Caribou in Wilderness Park</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to release up to 50 caribou in a
protected wilderness park as part of an effort to bring the animal
back to Maine were unanimously rejected Tuesday by the Baxter State
Park Authority.
   The privately funded project sought to release dozens of the
North American reindeer, extinct in Maine for 80 years, from crates
carried by helicopter to an isolated section of the 200,000-acre
park known as the Klondike.
   The bowl-shaped area, inaccessible by road, is the only area in
the state known to be a calving area for caribou.
   Project leader Mark McCollough, a University of Maine wildlife
biologist, said he may try to address the authority's concerns and
return with a new request. He said another option would be to
release the animals in one of several alternate sites in the state.
   Members of the three-member authority and its advisory panel
pummeled McCollough with questions and complaints about the way the
3-year-old project has been run prior to the authority's vote.
   Maine Attorney General James E. Tierney, chairman of the
authority, said he found ``constant shifts and turns'' in the
reintroduction project's plans ``very frustrating.''
   ``Without any exhaustive analysis ... you're simply asking us to
put more animals into the wild,'' said Tierney.
   Others expressed concern about the noise created by the two to
three planned weekly airplane flights over the Klondike to check on
the caribou.
   Park Director Irvin ``Buzz'' Caverly Jr., who is not a member of
the authority, said, ``The only time communications have been good
were when you wanted something from us.''
   Caverly said he was disturbed when he heard or read news reports
of caribou deaths before project officials informed him.
   McCollough acknowledged a failure to provide a comprehensive
written report on the progress of the effort and offered to improve
communications. He said no alternative release plan had been
approved by the project board.
   The planned release would have been the second in a year in
Baxter park, which is in north-central Maine.
   Of the dozen let go from an enclosure deep in the woods last
April, 10 are known to be dead from attacks by other animals,
disease or accidents.
   McCollough, who maintains that 80 to 100 caribou must be
released in order to make the reintroduction effort viable, wanted
to release about 25 caribou now living in pens near the state
university in Orono in Baxter in April.
   He wanted to release an additional 25 caribou the Canadian
province Newfoundland has agreed to give Maine this year if the
animals are rounded up before April.
   The project began in 1986, when more than two dozen caribou were
rounded up after being shot by dart guns from helicopters in
Newfoundland. Those animals were used as a ``nursery herd'' to
breed caribou for releases.

   The Energy Department is launching a special
study of oil company profit margins in response to a congressional
outcry over extraordinary increases in home heating fuel prices
last month in the Northeast and Midwest.
   The Energy Information Administration, an independent office
within the Energy Department, agreed to conduct the study after
members of a House panel demanded a public accounting of who
profited from the price increase of as much as 50 percent.
   ``With the across-the-board increases we have suffered, it would
seem likely that antitrust violations have occurred,'' said Rep.
Toby Roth, R-Wis., in testimony before the energy and power
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   The oil industry blames the price rise on a combination of
unusual circumstances, including high demand for fuel as a result
of extreme cold in the Northeast and Midwest, relatively low levels
of company fuel inventories, transportation bottlenecks caused by
cold weather and refinery shutdowns due to accidents.
   Wholesale prices of home heating oil and propane have been
falling in recent days in response to a break in the cold spell,
but the declines have not yet reached the consumer level. Retail
prices of home heating oil in the Northeast surged from about 90
cents a gallon in late November and still stood as high as $1.50 a
gallon last week at the retail level.
   Helmut Merklein, chief of the Energy Information Administration,
told the panel his office by May would have a comprehensive study
of the December price increases to ``tell you where in the chain
the profits were made'' and to determine whether there was evidence
of oil industry collusion to gouge consumers.
   Merklein indicated that there was no such evidence at this time.
   Several members of the panel complained that Merklein's study
would take too long, and later Merklein agreed to launch
immediately a quicker preliminary assessment of profits during the
December price spiral. He didn't say when it would be completed.
   John Easton, assistant secretary for international affairs and
energy emergencies, told the panel price increases were due mainly
to ``unprecedented demand.'' He said this was caused by the harsh
December weather, which in the Northeast was the coldest in at
least 60 years.
   ``The current tight market conditions should ease shortly when
additional supplies of products flow into the regional markets from
domestic and offshore sources,'' he said, adding that would put
downward pressure on energy prices.
   Easton said supplies coming to the market ``should suffice for
the rest of the winter.'' But he added, ``If the weather should
turn again, we once again could see short supplies.''
   Easton came under heavy attack from several subcommittee members.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., accused him of acting as a mouthpiece
for the oil industry and suggested that the administration tacitly
endorsed the industry's price increases.
   ``I would like to remind you that you are on the public payroll,
not the industry payroll,'' Cooper said, adding, ``The president
probably knows on a first-name basis most of the fellows who are
making'' big profits from the price spiral.
   President Bush is a former oil company executive.
   Easton said Bush was opposed to regulating energy prices or
supplies but favored providing federal aid to low-income families
hurt most by sudden price increases.

<HEAD>Decision May Change Tenure Procedures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court decision may change the
traditional method of selecting college and university professors
for lifetime faculty appointments.
   The court ruled Tuesday that institutions of higher learning
generally may be forced to disclose confidential peer review
records when accused of illegally denying tenure to a faculty
member.
   ``The ruling puts a university on the same footing as any
employer accused of illegal discrimination,'' said Sarah Burns of
the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education
Fund.
   ``Knowing this, those responsible are more likely to see to it
that the peer review process is a fair one,'' she said.
   But Sheldon Steinbach of the American Council on Education,
which had urged the court to find an ``academic freedom'' privilege
to withhold such information, said the decision could make the
process less candid.
   ``It may have a substantial impact on how much candor (a
school's peer review committee members) are willing to put in
writing,'' he said. ``The decision may drive portions of the
process underground. For example, phone conversations may play a
larger role.''
   Writing for a unanimous court, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said:
   ``The costs associated with racial and sexual discrimination in
institutions of higher learning are very substantial. Few would
deny that ferreting out this information is a great, if not
compelling, government interest.
   ``If there is a `smoking gun' to be found that demonstrates
discrimination in tenure decisions, it is likely to be tucked away
in peer review files.''
   The decision is a key preliminary victory for a former
University of Pennsylvania professor challenging her denial of
tenure.
   Penn's appeal from a federal appeals court ruling that
disclosure is required had been supported by Princeton, Brown,
Stanford, Harvard, Yale and the American Council on Education.
   Rosalie Tung, then an associate professor of management at Penn,
was denied tenure in 1985 at Penn's Wharton School.
   Ms. Tung filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission charging she was the victim of illegal
discrimination against women and people of Asian descent.
   After the university refused an EEOC request for peer review
documents, the agency subpoenaed them.
   In the ensuing court fight, university officials argued in favor
of a balancing test, approved by some federal appeals courts, that
would allow the school to keep the information secret unless it was
shown to be essential to the discrimination claim.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988 rejected that
argument, and its ruling was upheld Tuesday.
   ``The Supreme Court has resolved an issue that has divided the
federal appeals courts for a decade,'' Steinbach said. ``It's very
hard to find much pleasure in a 9-0 vote against your position.''
   ``I'm very delighted with the decision,'' said Ms. Tung, now a
business professor at the University of Wisconsin. ``I fought for
the principle and I'm glad that I won it.''
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Struck down a major portion of a Dallas anti-pornography
ordinance, ruling 6-3 that its licensing requirements for sexually
oriented businesses violates free-speech rights.
   _Unanimously ruled in an Indiana case that the Internal Revenue
Service may not tax as income the deposits utility companies charge
their customers to ensure payment of future bills.
   Bush administration lawyers said more than 150 such cases
involving more than $300 million in potential taxes are pending in
lower courts and before the IRS.

   When L. Douglas Wilder takes the oath of
office in Virginia on Saturday, he faces the pressures of a budget
crunch and of history: He will be the nation's first elected black
governor.
   ``I feel that, but ... it's not a weight,'' says Wilder, a
lawyer who became the state's first black lieutenant governor four
years ago.
   Wilder, who turns 59 in a week, said he recognizes he is a model
for other blacks seeking high political office.
   ``I am aware that any mistakes I make will hamper or curtail the
momentum,'' he said in an interview. ``I will be working very much
so to see that that doesn't happen.''
   Wilder's inauguration comes as the state's economic boom of the
1980s is slowing. Gov. Gerald L. Baliles has ordered cuts to close
an $181 million revenue shortfall in the fiscal year ending June
30. He has proposed further cuts in the 1990-92 budget.
   Wilder has taken plenty of ribbing that he picked a bad time to
become governor, but he disagrees.
   ``The true test of leadership sometimes doesn't come when things
are good,'' he said. ``It requires innovation. I welcome that
challenge.''
   Wilder may even benefit from the economic hard times if he shows
he can hold down state spending, observers say.
   ``He knows that. He's not terribly upset by all this,'' said
Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia.
``If he can assure that western civilization doesn't collapse,
he'll be hailed as having accomplished a great deal.''
   Wilder's 20 years of experience in public office and his
magnetic personality bode him well, legislators and analysts say.
   ``Doug Wilder knows the system. He's a product of it,'' said
state Delegate Clifton A. ``Chip'' Woodrum, a Democrat. ``Doug
Wilder can charm the bark off a tree.''
   But Wilder also has a reputation for ruthlessly punishing his
political enemies.
   ``He's a very complex person. He can be enormously charming. He
can also be extremely vindictive. We have to see what side of the
personality predominates during the term,'' Sabato said.
   Former Republican state Sen. Ray L. Garland, who served with
Wilder in the Senate, said the Democratic governor-elect gets along
with most of the state's 140 legislators, and has managed to remain
independent of the state's powerful business lobby.
   ``I think he ... will take a very independent line,'' Garland
said. ``The one negative is he's never had any experience running
any sizable enterprise.''
   Analysts said Wilder's portrayal of himself as a fiscal
conservative, which began with his run for lieutenant governor in
1985, should help him if he seeks a U.S. Senate seat or national
political office after his four-year terms ends. Virginia governors
cannot succeed themselves under state law.
   Wilder has said the state's financial crunch may keep him from
filling a campaign pledge to cut sales taxes on food and
non-presciption drugs.
   His administration may be haunted by another tax break approved
last year for retirees. To satisfy a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the
legislature approved pension tax relief that will cost $235 million
during the next two years. The state could have to pay $400 million
more to retirees if the courts rule the tax break must be made
retroactive for three years.
   Wilder also faces challenges in the areas of health and
corrections, where demand and costs are rising.
   To curb the costs of health care, Wilder said he would consider
limiting Medicare benefits for the elderly who can afford their
health costs.
   In corrections, Wilder said he would support more alternatives
to incarceration such as electronic monitoring of offenders in
their homes and greater use of prison labor on state projects.
   Wilder said he wants to build on previous transportation, trade
and education initiatives, but also wants to distinguish his
administration as one devoted to youth and family.
   With such an ambitious agenda, ``I'm going to have more on my
plate than I can say prayers over,'' Wilder said.

   Barbara Bush says she really hates to give it
up, but her sapphire blue satin-and-velvet inaugural gown is
joining a display of other dresses worn by first ladies.
   Mrs. Bush on Tuesday presented her Arnold Scaasi gown to the
Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American History.
   ``I love this dress and I really hate to give it up,'' she said.
   She also surrendered the purse, shoes and the Kenneth J. Lane
fake pearls she wore with the gown. Mrs. Bush wore the ensemble
when George Bush was inaugurated last January, and again at a
diplomatic gala.
   In brief remarks to a small group of invited guests at the
museum, Mrs. Bush paid tribute to Scaasi and to Yves Graux, her
longtime hairdresser, for helping her through a year during which
she suffered from Graves disease. The affliction is an immune
system condition that affected her eyes and thyroid.
   ``Everybody knows I've had a dumb year with pop eyes and all
sorts of weird things,'' she said.
   ``Without my hairdresser, my precious Mr. Scaasi, and other
friends who made me feel like I looked good anyway, it would have
been a different year,'' she said.
   Tuesday was Mrs. Bush's seventh consecutive day of 10 radiation
treatments to combat the eye irritation and double vision resulting
from her illness.
   Her eyes looked reddish, as they sometimes have during the past
several months, but she was jocular and relaxed. Mrs. Bush wore a
bright purple, long-sleeved knit dress by Scaasi.
   Her press secretary, Anna Perez, said the 64-year-old first lady
``feels fine,'' although it won't be known for some time whether
the radiation is working.
   She quipped that the Grecian-statue face on the mannequin
wearing her inaugural gown ``looks exactly like me.''
   Scaasi said he has duplicated the dress, in different colors,
for sale in ready-to-wear collections.
   ``I asked the White House if they would mind, and they said they
wouldn't,'' he told reporters.
   The dress will be on display in a museum gallery with those of
former first ladies Jacqueline Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia
Nixon, Betty Ford, Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan. Gowns of other
first ladies also are part of the display.
   Scaasi, Mrs. Bush's favorite designer, said the first lady
chooses her own clothes and ``has great carriage.''
   ``She's a woman who knows what she wants,'' Graux said of Mrs.
Bush.
   Mrs. Bush was diagnosed early last year with Graves' disease,
which initially attacked her thyroid, making it overproductive and
causing weight loss. The thyroid condition was alleviated with a
radioactive treatment and drugs, but the eye symptoms have
persisted.

<HEAD>Senate Paying $150 an Hour for Ethics Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate ethics committee is paying $150 an
hour to private lawyers investigating seven senators, more than
other panels recently permitted but far less than the going rate
for a major civil or criminal defense.
   Attorneys Robert S. Bennett, Henry F. Scheulke III and N.
Richard Janis, have open-ended contracts for a $150 hourly fee, the
ethics panel's staff director, Wilson Abney, said Tuesday.
   Their associates receive $125 or $150 hourly and services of
paralegals bill $50 an hour said Abney, who declined to reveal how
much the lawyers have been paid so far.
   The private lawyers, hired last year, are prominent Washington
attorneys with major firms. Top law firms in Washington are known
to charge between $275 and $400 per hour for similar work.
   Nonetheless, the top rate has risen when compared with the
hourly fee paid outside counsel in recent cases.
   Last year, the House ethics committee paid a Chicago law firm
$125 an hour to investigate Jim Wright, who was then the speaker of
the House. The firm received the same fee to advise the panel on
whether to pursue an investigation of House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich of Georgia.
   But while the top rate was lower, all lawyers billed the
committee the same fee.
   The fee was even less _ $100 an hour _ for the private lawyers
who assisted the House Judiciary Committee last year in the
impeachment cases of two judges, Walter Nixon and Alcee Hastings.
   Bennett, known for winning acquittals for white-collar criminal
defendants, is conducting two committee investigations.
   In a case that has reached something akin to a grand jury
investigation, Bennett is advising the committee on whether Sen.
David Durenberger, R-Minn., evaded honoraria limits when he
collected speaking fees to promote a book he authored.
   Another aspect of Durenberger's conduct hasn't quite advanced
that far: an allegation that the senator improperly profited by
renting his Minneapolis condominium to himself.
   Bennett also is handling the case centering on senators who met
with federal bank regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr.
when his Lincoln Savings and Loan was under examination by
regulators. The government took over the thrift last April and is
expected to spend more than $2 billion _ a record for a thrift
institution failure _ to protect depositors.
   Keating and his associates contributed some $1.3 million to the
campaigns and causes of the five senators: Republican John McCain
of Arizona and Democrats Dennis DeConcini of Arizona; John Glenn of
Ohio; Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, the banking committee
chairman, and Majority Whip Alan Cranston of California. All have
denied wrongdoing.
   Scheulke, a former assistant U.S. attorney, and Janis, the
lawyer for Iran-Contra figure Albert Hakim, are investigating Sen.
Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   A complaint against D'Amato, filed with the committee by a
former political opponent, charged the senator steered Department
of Housing and Urban Development money to his friends and campaign
contributors.
   Meanwhile, senators in the Keating case are responding to an
ethics committee request for all available documents that would
help the panel, according to spokesmen for several of the senators.
   Glenn's spokeswoman, Rebecca Bell, said the request asked for
documents that ``reflect a relationship with Charles Keating,
American Continental Corp. (Lincoln's parent company) and Lincoln
Savings and Loan'' and with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board _ the
former name for the thrift regulatory agency.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Oral Typhoid Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oral typhoid vaccine approved by the Food
and Drug Administration has fewer side effects than the injected
vaccines that are currently available.
   ``This vaccine will be important to tourists, business people
and the military traveling to remote, less-developed areas where
sanitation is poor,'' said Louis Sullivan, secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services, parent agency of the FDA.
   The FDA announced Tuesday that it had approved the new vaccine,
called typhoid live oral Ty21a.
   Typhoid fever is rare in the United States. About 400 to 500
cases are reported annually, and in the majority of them the
infection was contracted in other countries, the FDA said.
   The disease is caused by a bacterial organism called Salmonella
typhi, which is spread through contaminated food and water.
Infection is marked by prolonged fever, headache and malaise. About
10 percent f untreated cases and fewer than 1 percent of treated
cases are fatal, the FDA said.
   Antibiotics are used to treat the infection, but the FDA said
the recent emergence of drug-resistant strains can make the disease
harder to treat.
   Immunization against typhoid is recommended for people traveling
to Central and South America, Africa, India and Southeast Asia.
   The injectable vaccine can cause severe, sometimes
incapacitating side effects, including fever. About 20 percent to
25 percent of people who are immunized by injection experience side
effects severe enough to prevent them from working, said FDA
spokeswoman Faye Peterson.
   In tests on more than half a million people, the new vaccine was
found to be as effective as the injected form without the side
effects, the FDA said.
   The vaccine was developed and is made by the Swiss Serum and
Vaccine Institute in Berne, Switzerland. Berna Products Corp. of
Coral Gables, Fla., will distribute the vaccine as Vivotif Berna
Vaccine.

   A resort billboard that urges would-be
skiers to ``Go ahead. Call in sick,'' and hit the slopes in midweek
has drawn complaints.
   ``We all have different senses of humor. We really thought that
this was so bold that it would be obvious we were kidding,'' Robert
J. Shannon Jr., director of marketing at Stratton Mountain, said
Monday.
   The sign along Interstate 91, which went up in November, has
caused at least 17 people to write letters of complaint to the
resort.
   Because of the letters, a new billboard will replace the old one
this week with the less-offending message, ``More White. Less
Green.''
   ``I just figured that if we had that many complaints there were
five or six times that many out there,'' Shannon said. ``We said
instead of infuriating any more of the western Massachusetts
populace we'll just take it down.''

   A 100-year-old physician who first voted
for William Howard Taft against Theodore Roosevelt threw his hat in
the ring to run against U.S. Rep. Martin Lancaster.
   ``I think it stands to reason I won't stay up there for a long
time,'' Dr. Henry Stenhouse said Tuesday. ``I will voluntarily say
I will not serve more than two terms. I think that's enough and the
Lord will probably take me away before then.''
   Stenhouse, a former Navy doctor who set up a private practice in
Goldsboro in 1937, said it was his first try at elected office. He
will be running for the Third District seat in Congress.
   ``I want to give him a little competition,'' Stenhouse said when
asked why he decided to challenge Lancaster, a Democrat who has
served two terms. ``I think the people in this state and everywhere
need a choice and they haven't given them a choice.''
   Stenhouse, who turned 100 last month, said he was born into a
Republican family.

<TEXT>
   Boris Andreyevich Grebenyuk, a leader in the
Soviet Union's coal strike last summer, wished he had some Soviet
officials along for his look inside a West Virginia mine.
   ``I would have liked to have someone from our government take a
look at the wonderful working conditions at this mine,'' Grebenyuk
said Tuesday. ``If they would have, they wouldn't be saying our
demands are unreasonable.''
   Grebenyuk was one of eight Soviet coal miners who toured
Consolidation Coal Co.'s Blacksville No. 2 mine, the state's
largest underground mine. The visit was arranged by the United Mine
Workers of America and the AFL-CIO.
   The group of Russian, Ukranian and Kazakh miners all were
prominent players in a strike that ended after Soviet leaders
agreed to recognize the miners' dissident union and negotiate for
better salaries and work conditions.
   The group arrived in the United States last week and visited
union leaders in New York and Washington, D.C., before traveling to
West Virginia.
   The Soviets began their tour of the 4-square-mile mine by
trading sport jackets and ties for green overalls, wide leather
safety belts, yellow hardhats, safety glasses and battery-powered
lamps.
   ``In the Soviet Union we don't have belts like these, we use
string or rope or anything we can find,'' said Alexey Dimitriyevich
Bokarev, 35, who led the strike at the Soviet Union's Donetsk coal
operation.
   After a safety demonstration, the group descended 640 feet in a
caged elevator, the start of a three-mile train ride to the coal
face.
   The tour through the Consol mine was designed to show the
Soviets how trade unions and management work in the United States.
   The mine was not part of the nine-month UMW strike against The
Pittston Co., which affected 1,700 miners in West Virginia,
Virginia and Kentucky. Negotiators have reached a tentative
agreement to the end that strike, but the union's rank and file has
yet to ratify it. Key issues are health care and retirement
benefits.
   After Tuesday's tour, an exuberant Bokarev gave a thumbs-up sign
at the mine's portal just outside this tiny coal town, located
about 25 miles west of Morgantown.
   ``It's Number 1,'' Bokarev said. ``It's truly an ideal working
situation. I will tell my fellow miners that we were justified in
going on strike after seeing conditions such as these.''
   Grebenyuk agreed. ``We saw humane treatment and a real concern
for the workers. It's much easier to work here than in our mines,''
he said. ``Now, we understand why coal mining in the United States
is a financially viable occupation.''

   President Bush on Tuesday praised Martin
Luther King Jr.'s courage in the face of threats and promised to
``bring to justice the bigots'' responsible for a wave of bombings
against civil rights leaders two decades after King's death.
   Dr. Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, a prime
target of the hate campaign, emerged from the Oval Office saying he
was ``fairly satisfied'' with federal efforts to solve the
bombings, but was seeking further assurance ``that from the
presidency down there is a sense of urgency.''
   Bush invited civil rights leaders and students to the White
House to witness his signing a proclamation in connection with
Monday's holiday in marking King's birthday.
   Later, after meeting privately with Hooks, Bush said he
reassured the NAACP leader ``that my administration will not
tolerate bigotry and racial prejudice. We must finally leave the
tired old baggage of bigotry and racial hatred behind us.''
   Bush said his administration ``will not let up in the fight
against racism and ... will work to bring the perpetrators of these
hideous crimes to justice.''
   Mail bombs last month claimed the lives of a federal judge in
Alabama and a civil rights leader in Georgia. Federal authorities
intercepted other bombs aimed at the federal courthouse in Atlanta
and an NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla. Threats have been aimed
at the 600,000-member NAACP, and security has been stepped up at
its 600 branches across the South.
   Monday is the 61st anniversary of the birth of King, leader of
the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s that brought an
end to legal segregation. King was assassinated in Memphis on April
4, 1968. His birthday has been a federal holiday since 1986.
   Bush paid tribute to King, saying ``his life was central to the
story of America. ... His goal was an America where equality and
opportunity could co-exist.''
   ``He endured death threats and these obscene phone calls in the
dead of the night and he refused to be intimidated. Through his
courage, Dr. King changed forever America for the better,'' the
president said.
   ``While he did so much, there is much that remains to be done
.... particularly when we hear of bombings, obscene phone calls,
hate mail, each one of us must speak out.''
   He promised to use the presidency ``always to denounce and work
to bring to justice the bigots who stain this good and decent
land.''
   Despite the cordial words, Bush's own civil rights appointees
and stances on judicial rulings have often been the target of
criticism by civil rights leaders. Civil rights lobbyists last
summer helped defeat the nomination of William Lucas, a former
Michigan sheriff, to the Justice Department's top civil rights
post. Lucas, now a department liaison official, attended the King
Day proclamation signing.
   While Bush and Hooks were meeting, leaders of the National Urban
League were unveiling a report decrying black poverty in America
and calling for ``an urban Marshall Plan'' to close the black-white
economic gap.
   Hooks said the NAACP will be looking for future dates with Bush
to address such social needs, and he said he wants money now going
to the Pentagon diverted to social programs.
   Referring to the Reagan administration, Hooks said, ``The last
eight years have been very `anti' as it relates to civil rights.
This present administration, I think, has moved cautiously and
judiciously in the field.''
   He added that Bush ``has made many very excellent statements and
in the next few months we will be moving to get him to go further
on it.''
   ``We did not ask for any federal protection and he did not offer
it,'' said Hooks, adding that he is not interested in leading a
``straitjacket life.''
   The 600,000-member NAACP is increasing security for its 2,200
branches with advice from the government, Hooks said, adding, ``I
am satisfied that the president wants to do what is right on this
thing.''
   A person or group calling itself Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System claimed responsibility for killing U.S.
Circuit Judge Robert Vance on Dec. 16 at his home outside
Birmingham, Ala., and Robert Robertson, a Savannah, Ga., lawyer and
civil rights leader, two days later.

   A racially mixed group of several hundred people
gathered in a church to try and ease racial tensions exacerbated by
the slaying in which a white man falsely accused a black.
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, one of the organizers of Tuesday night's
service held in the neighborhood where Charles and Carol Stuart
were found shot on Oct. 23, said it was time for the city to heal
from events surrounding the shooting.
   ``Moving on,'' Flynn told the audience at Mission Church.
``That's what the city of Boston is doing here tonight.''
   Charles Stuart told police he was shot and his pregnant wife was
killed by a black mugger after they left a childbirth class in the
Mission Hill neighborhood. Their premature son, Christopher,
delivered by Caesarean section, died 17 days later.
   Police immediately undertook a door-to-door investigation of the
racially mixed community, and a black man became a suspect in the
case. He was later cleared.
   Last week, Stuart's brother Matthew came forward with evidence
that implicated Stuart in the killing. Charles Stuart jumped to his
death off a Boston bridge on Thursday after his brother went to
police.
   Since Stuart's suicide, the Mission Hill community and the
area's black leaders have criticized police and the media for their
willingness to accept that a black man had committed the crime.
   Jay LaCroix, a lawyer from Mission Hill, said he has been angry
about the whole ordeal.
   ``We worked very hard to bring about racial harmony here. And we
will continue to work very hard,'' he said. ``We need to come
together.''
   Rev. Joseph Washington of the Wesley United Methodist Church,
told the capacity crowd that the events in the past few months have
made him wonder why racism still exists in Boston.
   ``I ask `Why can't we get this race thing together?''' he said.
``Why can't this city, this world, come together as God intended?''
   Flynn closed his remarks by quoting the Prayer of St. Francis:
``Lord make me an instrument of Thy peace.''
   He asked the audience to leave the church ``committed to unity,
committed to understanding, and committed to love and peace.''

   Carol Stuart, who was raised in a
close-knit family headed by a pizza-dough maker, was a ``little
Cinderella,'' a friend said. Her fairy tale, though, ended with a
bullet in her head.
   After a week of silence, her anguished family is beginning to
talk about the horror of discovering that the son-in-law they had
invited to dinner after her death may have been the one who plotted
the shooting.
   ``It's unbelievable, we never would have guessed it in a million
years,'' Mrs. Stuart's brother, Carl DiMaiti, said Tuesday.
   He said even looking back now, no one in the family could recall
a clue of discord between his sister and her husband.
   DiMaiti said his sister had a ``totally happy life.'' He and
others said she was devoted to her family. She talked to her mother
every day and she ``idolized'' her father, according to one friend.
   Carol's father, second-generation Italian-American, is still
paying off the cost of Carol's education _ and the cost of her
lavish 1985 wedding.
   ``She was a little Cinderella,'' said Carol Dunn, who worked
closely with Carol from the time she started at Suffolk University
Law School in Boston in 1983. ``She was a shining light. She was so
bubbly and outgoing. I never saw her in a bad mood.''
   Dark-haired and petite, 30-year-old Carol Stuart worried about
her weight and almost always ate salads. But mostly, Dunn said,
``she worried about other people and took care of them.''
   Dunn was especially impressed with Carol's close relationship
with her family and her then-boyfriend, whom everyone called Chuck.
   Tall, handsome Charles Stuart, a former altar boy, was as
reserved as Carol was vivacious.
   ``He was quiet and she always had something to say so it was
like Carol was the little spotlight and no one paid attention to
him,'' said Dunn, who remembers Charles Stuart faithfully picking
Carol up at school each night. ``You got the impression he was her
solid rock. When she got her engagement ring, she was on cloud
nine.''
   Carol met Charles Stuart at a restaurant in his hometown of
Revere 10 years ago. She was a waitress and he was a cook and
dishwasher.
   Remy Sharrillo, 69, of Medford, who knew Carol and her family
since she was 15, said her parents never wanted her to marry
Charles.
   ``He was a dishwasher,'' Sharrillo said. ``The father didn't
like him at all and the wife wasn't that crazy about him either.
They finally gave in when she wanted to marry him. She idolized the
guy. She was nuts about him.''
   Carol's parents, Giusto and Evelyn DiMaiti, have remained in
seclusion since Carol's death. They have been under sedation at
times.
   The DiMaitis had some of Charles Stuart's siblings to their
house while he was hospitalized and invited Charles to dinner two
days before the 30-year-old killed himself by jumping off a Boston
bridge.
   Charles' brother Matthew told his lawyer that he told some
friends and family members about the killing after it occurred.
   That knowledge is one of the hardest things to face, said Carl
DiMaiti, Carol's older brother and only sibling.
   Carl presented a moving eulogy at his sister's funeral in which
he said she would forgive her killer.
   He said his most enduring memory of her was ``how much she loved
her family and Chuck.''

morning of her father's murder last March.
   Ronnie Edward Say, 47, was choked, stabbed, beaten on the head
with a fireplace poker when he returned home that night.
   The recently divorced Say had moved with his daughter from the
San Francisco Bay area to the San Joaquin Valley a few months
earlier in an attempt to escape urban crime, a sister said.
   Berto Talaveras, 15, and Juan Valdez, 13, were convicted of
murder, and turned over to the youth authority for their
15-year-to-life sentences.
   Juvenile Judge Duane Martin opened the juvenile cases to the
public because of the ``heinous nature'' of the crime.

   The third in a series of wet, windy, destructive storms blew
ashore Tuesday in the Pacific Northwest, knocking out power,
causing mudslides, prompting evacuation of a nursing home and
closing an interstate highway.
   Rain and snow fell around the Great Lakes.
   In Oregon, morning winds gusted to 73 mph at Seaside, 70 mph at
Cape Blanco and Tillamook, and 62 mph at Gold Beach.
   Portland (Ore.) General Electric reported about 26,000 customers
without electricity in the Portland area and more outages being
reported by the hour. About 14,000 had been without power since
Monday, PGE spokesman Steve Sautter said.
   Elsewhere, winds gusted to about 90 mph at Squaw Mountain,
Colo., 60 mph at higher elevations between Cheyenne and Laramie,
Wyo., and 55 mph at Livingston, Mont.
   Rain fell from much of Washington state to western Montana.
Seattle-Tacoma Airport got 2.38 inches of rain between 1 a.m. and
10 a.m. PST, a record for January.
   One person was injured in the Seattle suburb of Kent when a
mudslide smashed an eight-unit apartment building. The man was
trapped in the wreckage and had to be rescued by firefighters, said
Fire Department spokesman Mike DeHart.
   High water, mudslides and downed trees blocked roads in parts of
Washington and Oregon.
   Officials in Pierce County, Wash., said 83 people were evacuated
Tuesday night from a nursing home in McKenna, about 20 miles east
of Olympia. And Thurston County sheriff's deputies said residents
in low-lying areas along the Nisqually River were being told to go
for the night to shelters set up at schools.
   Interstate 5, the region's main north-south artery, was closed
as water rose more than a foot over the roadway at Centralia, Wash.
Daily traffic there is about 25,000 vehicles, a state official said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 10 a.m. PST included
2.4 inches in Olympia; 2.04 inches in Seattle; 1.93 inches in
Tacoma, Wash.; 1.69 inches in Fort Lewis, Wash.; and 1.54 inches in
Astoria, Ore.
   Similar storms rushed across the Northwest on Saturday and from
late Sunday into early Monday. By Monday afternoon, 25,000 damage
claims had been filed with four major insurance carriers in the
Northwest for an estimated $12.5 million, according to the Western
Insurance Information Service in Beaverton.
   Elsewhere, rain occasionally mixed with snow fell across Lower
Michigan.
   Rain also fell over northwestern Ohio, northern and central
Indiana, northeastern Illinois, southeastern Wisconsin, and along
the New York state shore of Lake Ontario.
   Snow fell over western Upper Michigan, northwestern Wisconsin
and northeastern Minnesota.
   In the East, icy pavement contributed to a 24-car pileup at East
Orange, N.J., and ice plus fog led to a 16-car smashup on
Interstate 64 near Nitro, W.Va., in which one person was killed,
police said.
   Weather was warm along the West Coast, with a record high of 61
degrees at Portland, Ore. Oakland, Calif., tied its record of 64
degrees and Klamath Falls, Ore., tied its record of 52.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 5 degrees above zero
at Elkins, W.Va.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 16
degrees at Detroit Lakes, Minn., to 81 at Homestead, Fla.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell
Wednesday, while the U.S. dollar edged up against the yen.
   The dollar closed at 145.30 yen, up 0.33 yen from Tuesday's
close of 144.97 yen. The currency opened at 145.33 yen and ranged
between 145.25 yen and 145.90 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 254.95 points, or 0.67
percent, ending the day at 37,696.51. It shed 343.50 points Tuesday
and fell below the 38,000-point mark for the first time since Dec.
12, when it closed at 37,803.53.
   Dealers attributed the fall to a continuing plunge in bond
prices. Prices of 10-year future government bonds lost 0.94 yen to
99.45 yen, or 70 cents, overnight, to fall to their lowest level
since September 1988.
   The decline in bond prices raises bond yields, which discourages
stock investment.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Umemori said the drop
occurred after a rumor, reported by Kyodo News Service, that Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev is to resign.
   ``Whenever the market is weak, any news or rumor could affect
trading, and this is what happened today,'' he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar continued to rise after opening
higher following an overnight jump on overseas markets.
   As the Gorbachev rumor ran across the market, Japanese investors
discarded the yen and bought the dollar, said Yuji Nakao, a trader
with Chemical Bank.
   ``Plunges in the stock and bond markets tumbled the foreign
exchange market, which has lacked stability due to political
uncertainties here and overseas,'' he said.
   Nakao said investor concerns over domestic politics have had a
stronger influence on trading than have economic fundamentals, such
as interest rates.
   The Bank of Japan sold $3 million to $4 million intermittently,
he said. The intervention ``would not work unless the U.S. Feds and
Bundesbank concertedly intervene,'' he said. The central bank does
not officially comment on its monetary actions.
   ``Concerns over the (ruling) Liberal Democratic Party, which
could still lose in the next election, are largely discouraging
yen-buying,'' especially on overseas markets, he said.
   A national election for the lower house of Parliament is
expected in mid-February.
   The LDP lost its long-held majority in the upper house of
Parliament last year in a show of public dissatisfaction over the
party's involvement in stock scandals and the introduction of an
unpopular consumer tax.

<HEAD>Singer Patti Page Sues Ad Agency Over Imitation of Voice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Patti Page is suing an advertising
agency for $1 million for allegedly imitating her voice in a
television commercial for a bank.
   Miss Page claims in the Superior Court lawsuit filed Tuesday
that Asher-Gould Advertising had a singer imitate her voice while
singing one of her hits, ``Old Cape Cod,'' in a 1989 commercial for
American Savings Bank.
   Officials of the Los Angeles advertising agency could not be
reached for comment after office hours Tuesday night.
   Miss Page, whose hits also included ``How Much is that Doggie in
the Window'' and ``The Tennessee Waltz,'' is being represented by
Arrow, Edelstein and Laird, the law firm that won a $400,000 award
for singer Bette Midler in a similar lawsuit.
   Miss Page's claims the agency violated a ruling that a federal
court made in the Midler case. The ruling stated that ``when a
distinctive voice of a professional singer is widely known and
deliberately imitated in order to sell a product, the sellers have
appropriated what is not theirs.''
   The lawsuit says bank customers were led to believe Miss Page
had endorsed the bank.

   Hundreds of Panamanians used
blowtorches and chainsaws to tear down the military headquarters of
Manuel Antonio Noriega, then carted off furniture and pornography
belonging to the toppled dictator.
   Hundreds of residents went to the bombed-out National Defense
headquarters after U.S. troops left the four-story cement compound,
which had been ringed by soldiers and coils of barbed wire since
the invasion Dec. 20.
   ``Tell the world that this is not looting,'' said Lolita del
Alvarado of the poor neighborhood of Chorrillo nearby. ``This is
money that belongs to the people. We had no medicine, no schools,
nothing. People in this neighborhood lived terribly.''
   American troops were bulldozing dilapidated and bullet-riddled
apartments and buildings in the area, site of some of the heaviest
fighting of the invasion, and are to rebuild the neighborhood.
   It was a family outing as parents went with their children,
grandparents and other relatives to the building where Noriega once
commanded his 14,000-member Defense Forces.
   No one stopped the looters, many of whom ransacked Noriega's
office and removed track lighting and wood paneling.
   One man showed a visitor a copy of European pornographic
magazines hidden among pages of official memos.
   Many sported ill-fitting military uniforms and shoulder patches
belonging to Noriega's army, and laughed and danced in the streets.
   Bright colored murals depicting Noriega's army in action, atop
armored cars and communicating via walkie talkies, adorned the
walls of the compound.
   Panamanians stopped to stare and snickered when they came upon
the words: ``Every man must at one time in his life decide whether
he dares go for victory, risking everything, or sit down and watch
the victors walk by.''
   Noriega went into hiding the night of the invasion and on
Christmas Eve sought refuge inside the Vatican embassy. He remained
there until he surrendered to U.S. troops a week ago and was flown
to Miami to face drug-trafficking charges.
   Panamanians used blowtorches, chainsaws, hammers and ice picks
to tear down the gates and iron fences surrounding the compound and
carted off pieces of wall, window frames and corrugated tin roofs.
   Outside the compound, a truck with ``war material'' painted on
its side was picked apart and sat without wheels. Other vehicles
lay on their sides, nothing but corrugated steel carcasses.
   Earlier Tuesday, between 150 and 200 protesters marched against
the invasion in the first demonstration of its kind. They passed
out leaflets lambasting the ``savage invasion which cut an open
wound in our national sovereignty.''
   Another 8,000 people attended a Mass and celebrated Noreiga's
downfall, chanting ``Viva Panama'' and waving white handerchiefs.
Archibishop Marcos McGrath urged the crowd to ``forget rancor and
hatred'' to build a new Panama.
   Both events commemorated the Day of the Martyrs, a national
holiday in memory of 23 Panamanians who died in anti-American riots
in 1964.
   Dozens of U.S. soldiers ringed the Peruvian ambassador's
residence, where 11 of Noriega's top officers had sought refuge
Monday.
   The Peruvian government said it had granted asylum to Noriega's
security aide, Capt. Gonzalo Gonzalez, who is on the U.S.
most-wanted list. The others included Noriega's secretary, Capt.
Marcela Tason; his top press spokesman, Maj. Edgardo Lopez
Grimaldo; and Maj. Heraclides Sucre, a commander of the elite
Battalion 2000.
   Peru's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jose Torres, told The
Associated Press in Lima that they would be allowed to come to Peru
if they wished, but that there had been no discussions on the
matter.
   ``It is supposed that they will try to go to some friendly
country, perhaps Peru,'' Torres said.
   President Alan Garcia has roundly criticized the U.S. invasion,
and refused to recognize the government of Guillermo Endara.
   Peruvian charge d'affairs Luis Sandiga denied Panamanian claims
that the residence was sheltering Lt. Col. Luis ``Papo'' Cordova,
one of Noriega's most-wanted associates.
   In Peru, Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox said Cordova had
sought refuge in the ambassador's residence, but Peruvian officials
refused.
   He said Cordova was considered a ``persona non grata'' and left
the residence ``of his own will.'' The foreign minister did not say
whether Cordova was apprehended by U.S. troops or if he had left
before the troops surrounded the residence.

   Nearly three weeks after the invasion of
Panama, the Pentagon says it estimates 220 Panamanian civilians
were killed during Operation Just Cause.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall, briefing reporters Tuesday,
stressed the figure was an estimate and that U.S. military
authorities and Panamanian officials were working to ``refine the
accuracy of that figure.''
   ``The U.S. military in Panama is working in concert with
representatives of all the hospitals, several agencies across the
spectrum of the Panamanian government and various relief and
humanitarian organizations'' to determine the number of Panamanians
killed, Hall said.
   Ever since the military attempt to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega began Dec. 20, U.S. military officials have been unable to
offer any sound estimate of the number of civilians killed in the
fighting and social chaos that erupted.
   Hall said the Institute for Legal Medicine, which acts as the
government's coroner, has counted 203 civilians killed as a direct
result of the military operation.
   However, Hall said, that organization still has a number of
cases to review and he said U.S. official expect the number to rise.
   ``We're being conservative. We think there'll be a few more. We
expect the figure to rise slightly,'' Hall said of the institute's
figure.
   Hall said 203 individuals were included in the 220 estimate
reached by U.S. officials and that both numbers include
``Panamanian Defense Forces and dignity battalions not in uniform
and otherwise unidentifiable, as well as looters and bona fide and
innocent civilians.''
   ``The institute has been unable to make any determination
whether the deaths were caused by U.S. military, PDF, dignity
battalions, looters or other civilians,'' Hall said.
   Officials estimate nearly 300 Panamanian soldiers were killed in
the fighting. The U.S. military death toll was 23.
   The spokesman said some 23,000 U.S. troops remain in Panama but
that about 4,000 have returned to the United States. About 13,000
troops were stationed in Panama before the invasion.
   Hall said he could offer no timetable for the return of the
remaining U.S. troops. He said about 700 were deployed in Panama in
``nation-building exercises'' to help re-establish civil and
governmental operations.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to discuss troop withdrawal
with Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
later this week, the spokesman said.
   Hall said U.S. troops detained 4,320 Panamanians in the course
of the military operation and 675 remained in detention by U.S.
military authorities.
   Those still in custody were being held pending background checks
or until the Panamanian legal and justice systems are rebuilt,
Pentagon officials said.
   Hall also said U.S. troops were searching vehicles leaving the
Peruvian Embassy in Panama City because ``there have been some
reports that people may or may not be in the embassy.''
   In Panama, government officials said the troops surrounded the
embassy because two of Noriega's top associates had taken refuge
inside.
   Hall said decisions about the conduct of U.S. troops are made by
the Southern Command, headed by Gen. Maxwell Thurman, and ``policy
considerations'' were taken into account in the movement of U.S.
troops in the region.
   ``General Thurman has the complete confidence'' of Cheney,
Powell and President Bush, Hall said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said U.S.
officials know who was in the Peruvian Embassy but she would not
identify them. She declined to discuss the legal authority of U.S.
troops involved in surrounding the embassy.

   The international drug trade threatens
the stability of entire nations, and the battle against drug
cartels can only be won if efficiently waged on a global scale,
according to a U.N. report released today.
   ``Despite unprecedented counteraction taken by the world
community, an interlocking network of criminal drug trafficking
organizations, heavily financed and armed, has become even bolder
and more ruthless,'' the 39-page survey says.
   In its review of 1989, the Vienna-based International Narcotics
Control Board warns that ``the danger of undermining and paralyzing
political institutions and economies of some countries has never
been greater.''
   ``The traffickers' declaration of war against a single country
endangers the security and integrity of all countries and
constitutes war against the whole international community,'' the
board said.
   To overcome the assault, ``the response of the international
community must be concerted, swift, more forceful, more
comprehensive, more innovative.''
   The board's 13 members, elected by the U.N. Economic and Social
Council, do not represent their governments. The board also
cooperates with other international agencies concerned with drug
control.
   ``For the criminal trafficking organizations, linked ... often
with terrorist insurgents, to prevail in the struggle in any one
country would imperil all countries,'' the report says. ``The war
to defeat them must be waged globally.''
   ``A situation as we see it at present has never existed
before,'' board secretary Abdelaziz Bahi said in an interview.
   There have always been drug traffickers, but now they not only
want money, ``they want to seize power in the state,'' he said.
   Since 1988, illicit production of narcotics has increased and
involved more countries, the report says, citing as an ``ominous
development'' _ the spread of opium poppy cultivation to Guatemala
and Colombia.
   In its survey, the board says it considers ``a milestone'' the
conclusion in December 1988 of the Convention against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
   As of November, 77 countries and the European Economic Community
were signatories to the convention, the board said.
   The survey, analyzing drug abuse in several regions, noted a
continued increase in drug-related deaths in Western Europe that
``has been escalating sharply in recent years ... Drug abuse and
illicit trafficking remain widespread throughout the region,
drug-related crime is rising quicker than any other type of
criminal offenses.
   In the United States, a ``National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse,'' shows that the estimated number of people abusing drugs at
least once a month has dropped 37 percent. The report attributed
the U.S. findings ``to a change in the general national attitude
toward drug abuse.''
   ``Nevertheless, the `frequent' abuse of cocaine is estimated to
have doubled since 1985,'' the survey said of drug use in the
United States.
   ``In that year, abuse of cocaine in the highly addictive form of
smokable `crack' began to spread, particularly in the inner cities,
and generated greater crime and violence.
   ``This has led to a 28-fold increase since 1984 in hospital
admissions involving the smoking of cocaine, which is now regarded
by authorities as the most pressing national drug abuse problem,''
the report says.
   The board voiced particular concern over the heavily armed drug
cartels in Latin America.
   To pursue their activities, these cartels, ``with enormous
financial resources continue their ruthless efforts to undermine
political institutions, disrupt national economies, murder
officials and private citizens,'' the survey says.
   ``Also of great concern is that drug abuse is spreading
throughout the continent and the countries of the region are at
risk of becoming major consumers.''
   In Colombia, where authorities have declared an all-out war on
drug traffickers, cocaine seizures in 1988 reached the highest
level since 1984, the report says.
   Some 25 tons of cocaine were seized and more than 800
laboratories destroyed, the report said. It did not give figures
for 1989.

   Jim Palmer, smooth symbol of the Baltimore
Orioles' championship teams of the 1970s, and Joe Morgan, model of
Cincinnati's ``Big Red Machine,'' have been elected to baseball's
Hall of Fame.
   They were elected Tuesday night, in their first year of
eligibility, by members of the Baseball Writers' Association of
America.
   Palmer was named on 411 of 444 ballots. Among pitchers, his 92.5
percent trailed only Bob Feller's 93.75 percent in 1962. Morgan,
second baseman on the Cincinnati Reds' teams of the 1970s, got 363
votes for 81.7 percent.
   ``To get in the first year is really special,'' Palmer said.
``There are a lot of guys who deserve it who don't.''
   Morgan said: ``As the old saying goes, only the players who are
deemed great make it on the first ballot. I guess that makes me a
great second baseman.''
   Players needed 75 percent, or 333 ballots, to be elected.
   Among those who came up short were pitchers Gaylord Perry, a
300-game winner, Ferguson Jenkins and Jim Bunning.
   Perry missed 72 percent. Jenkins got 296 votes and Bunning, who
fell four votes short of induction two years ago, received 257.
   Bunning, in his 14th year of eligibility, has one more remaining
before being passed to the baseball writers' Veterans Committee.
   Palmer was 268-152 in 19 full seasons, all with the Orioles, and
won an American League-record three Cy Young Awards.
   Palmer's 2.86 career earned run average ranks fourth all-time
among pitchers with 3,000 innings and he was a 20-game winner eight
times.
   Morgan won consecutive Most Valuable Player awards in 1975-76
with the Reds' World Series champions.
   Morgan batted .271 with 268 home runs, 1,133 RBIs and 689 stolen
bases in 22 full years. He was the National League rookie of the
year in 1965. In addition to the Reds, he played for the Houston
Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, San Francisco Giants and Oakland A's.
   In March, the Veterans Committee will vote on electing any
old-timers to the Hall.

   Declining bond prices and a rumor that the Soviet
leader would resign sent the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index lower
today, while the dollar kept gaining against the Japanese yen
despite central bank intervention.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 254.95 yen, or 0.67
percent, closing at 37,696.51.
   On Tuesday, it shed 343.50 points, falling below the
38,000-point mark. Since 1990 trading began on Thursday, the Nikkei
has fallen 1,240 points, or 3.3 percent.
   In this morning's trading, prices quickly fell across the board
after yet another rumor that Mikhail S. Gorbachev would resign,
dealers said.
   But the Nikkei rebounded somewhat in the afternoon on buying to
make profits from price gaps between the spot and futures markets.
   ``The recent downtrend in the Nikkei will not last long because
bond prices seem to have fallen enough, and the Nikkei has also
fallen back to the level where the year-end rally started,'' said
Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior dealer with Nikko Securities Co.
   ``Some investors started buying issues that had fallen
earlier,'' he said.
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 500
million shares, unchanged from the previous day.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 145.30 yen, up 0.33
yen from Tuesday's close of 144.97 yen. It opened at 145.33 yen and
ranged between 145.25 yen and 145.90 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 1.15 yen in three days.
   Its climb was aided today by market players selling yen after
the Gorbachev rumor, traders said.
   Naohiko Yasuda, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, said, ``The
market is very nervous lately, and is overreacting to rumors.''
   Rumors have affected both the currency and securities markets,
and these markets have affected each other, he added.
   Traders said the Bank of Japan sold some $400 million in efforts
to check the U.S. currency's rise. The central bank does not
officially comment on its currency market activities.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference
today that the dollar's current rally is based on speculation and
rumors, rather than economic fundamentals.
   He said the best response is coordinated intervention by the
Group of Seven countries _ the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy. Mieno said such coordination
still is working effectively.
   The governor said exchange rates cannot long stay out of line

<HEAD>Durenberger Says He Has Good Defense in Ethics Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, acknowledging that
depositions in the ethics case against him appear to support key
allegations, has canceled a 10-day to Moscow in part because of
time spent on preparing what he insists will be a strong defense to
present to the Senate Ethics Committee.
   ``I have a full legislative plate for this next congressional
session,'' the Minnesota Republican said Tuesday in a Statement.
``And admittedly, my time has been taken up by more personal
concerns in the last month which have delayed my preparations for
the state of Congress.''
   Meanwhile, he outlined his determination to prevail in the
ethics investigation in interviews with Minnesota newspapers.
   ``Nobody out there is going to run me out on a rail,'' he told
the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. ``Nobody out there is going to
tell me to resign.''
   The ethics committee is investigating allegations that
Durenberger laundered speaking fees through a book contract and
used special interest groups to underwrite personal trips to
Boston. The committee is also looking into real estate transactions
through which Durenberger was reimbursed by the Senate for renting
his Minneapolis condominium to himself.
   Durenberger said he read his attorney's summary of depositions
taken in his case for the first time Tuesday and concluded the
ethics committee is focusing on his book promotions, not on his
trips to Boston and him condominium. He said the depositions taken
at face value appear to support the charges against him.
   ``Some people allege that they didn't know that I was speaking
pursuant to a relationship with a publisher,'' he told the Pioneer
Press Dispatch. ``They thought I was responding to a request to
give an honorarium speech. Sometimes, allegedly, people were not
informed that I was making a speech on behalf of a publisher.''
   Durenberger suggested to the Minneapolis Star Tribune that his
ethics problems may be the result of ``sloppy legal work'' by top
aides he relied upon heavily to handle his personal finances.

<HEAD>Ask Soviets For Help in KAL Investigation, Senators Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations, the
Bush administration should ask the Soviet Union for help in
locating bodies or wreckage from the Korean jetliner shot down in
1983, three senators say.
   Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., asked the State Department to submit a formal request to
the Soviets for assistance.
   ``The Soviet government's response to such an inquiry would be
helpful in our efforts to gain as much information as possible
about the fate of KAL 007,'' the senators said in a letter to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A Soviet fighter plane shot down Korean Airlines Flight 007
after it strayed off course and entered Soviet airspace Sept. 1,
1983. All 269 people aboard, including 63 Americans, were killed.
   The Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense
reported that a two-month search failed to locate any wreckage or
bodies, the letter said. The Pentagon believes most of the wreckage
was located within 12 miles of the coast of Moneron Island, an area
the Soviets sealed off after the crash, the letter said.

<HEAD>DOE Decision Due Soon On Size, Cost of Collider</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is expected to decide by
month's end whether to spend more to build a super collider of the
strength originally envisioned or to scale back the project and
keep the price at $5.9 billion, Sen. Phil Gramm says.
   ``My guess is there will be a compromise. We want to be sure
that we don't buy a Cadillac _ that we buy a Chevrolet,'' Gramm,
R-Texas, said Tuesday.
   ``But we want to make sure it has four wheels, good brakes, a
steady engine and a good starter. What I don't want to do is be
penny-wise and pound-foolish. I want to make a rational decision,''
Gramm said.
   As planners move from a 1985 conceptual design of the particle
accelerator to an engineering blueprint, they're finding that
spending will have to increase to maintain the original scope of
the giant project.
   Otherwise, modifications must be made to keep the
superconducting super collider within its original price tag of
$5.9 billion.
   Gramm said DOE's High Energy Physics Advisory Board will meet
Friday to assess the impact of potential reductions on the
scientific capacity of the machine, which is to be built in Ellis
County south of Dallas.

<HEAD>World to Celebrate King Day Amid Democracy Triumphs, Bomb Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-democracy demonstrations around the world and
fear gripping the Southeast after recent mail bombings are adding
meaning to this year's celebrations honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
   Bells in 144 countries and the 50 United States will ring out
simultaneously and Wall Street will pause for a moment of silence
Monday on what would have been the slain civil-rights leader's 61st
birthday.
   For the first time, King's birthday will be celebrated on a
large scale in white-ruled South Africa. A weeklong celebration
will climax Jan. 20, when about 10,000 people are expected at a
Johannesburg event honoring black leaders including Archbishop
Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak.
   In this country, Montana, Idaho and New Hampshire have not
recognized the day as a state holiday. But organizers said bells
will ring in those states, and in the 47 states with King holidays,
at 12:30 p.m. EST, when the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia is tapped.
   In King's hometown of Atlanta, the center of King Week
celebrations, the 1990 holiday comes amid death threats that
followed last month's mail bombings of civil rights and judicial
targets in three Southeastern states.
   ``With the Klan and the mail bombs, this year it has a more
special meaning for everybody,'' said state Sen. Arthur Langford,
who portrays King in a yearly production of Langford's play ``Life
of a King.''
   ``People must understand that, in the words of Dr. King, we must
learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we will perish
together as fools.''
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said she will try to deflect
attention from the racial violence.
   ``To talk about this only invites people to do more of this kind
of violence,'' she said last week in announcing the week's events.
``It needs to be dealt with, but it needs to be dealt with in the
proper manner.''
   Mrs. King said she instead would emphasize pro-democracy
movements in Eastern Europe.
   ``The same philosophy, strategy and tactics of non-violence that
we used to break down the walls of segregation are now being used
to tear down the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain,'' she said.
   King Week 1990, sponsored by the King Center for Nonviolent
Social Change and the King Federal Holiday Commission, culminates
Monday, the first time the holiday has fallen on King's actual
birthday.
   King led a non-violent movement for racial equality in the 1950s
and 1960s that led to passage of federal legislation ending
official discrimination and segregation. He was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.
   In addition to the three states without King holidays, an
official King Day in Arizona is on hold. Wyoming's will be
celebrated for the first time, but only this year.
   In Arizona, Gov. Rose Mofford last fall signed into law a bill
to create a paid state holiday. But opponents filed petitions
calling for a referendum, keeping the law from becoming effective
until the vote. A King Day breakfast in Phoenix, however, is
expected to draw 1,500.
   Wyoming's Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan bucked the wishes of the
Republican-controlled Legislature and issued an executive order
calling for the holiday. However, the order only applies this year.
   Events scheduled in Atlanta this year include the unveiling of a
sculpture at the King memorial center and a speech by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson.
   A parade along Peachtree Street will conclude Monday's events
and will be nationally televised for the first time.
   Stoney Johnson, King Center media director, said security will
not be increased during any of the center's King Week activities
despite the mail bombs.
   ``It's so intense anyway that we don't need any more,'' he said.
   But Danny Levitan, executive director of the Center for
Democratic Renewal, which tracks hate group activity, warned that
violence may erupt in Atlanta just after King Day and the rest of
the nation ``should expect some attempts to disrupt events or
commit acts of violence'' Monday.
   On Jan. 20, Mississippi white supremacist Richard Barrett plans
a protest on National Park Service property across from King's
crypt in Atlanta. Park Service lawyers are reviewing the plan but
are expected to grant Barrett a permit, agency spokesman Paul
Winegar said.

<HEAD>Exxon: Refinery Worker Twice Restarted Flow Through Leaking
Pipeline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Exxon refinery operator twice restarted
the flow of oil through a leaking pipeline after automatic safety
systems stopped the flow, the company said in its first public
report on a 567,000-gallon spill.
   And in a private briefing for New York and New Jersey
environmental officials, Exxon officials disclosed that a system to
detect leaks in the pipeline had been faltering at least once or
twice a week for a year, a New York official said Tuesday.
   ``It seems that's the reason why the operator overrode the
system,'' said Carol Ash, a regional director of the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation. She would not elaborate.
   Exxon now says the Jan. 2 leak spilled 567,000 gallons of home
heating oil into the Arthur Kill shipping channel between the New
York City borough of Staten Island and New Jersey, Exxon said in a
summary of an internal report.
   Exxon initially said it had lost only 5,000 gallons.
   The report did not say how much more oil leaked because the
operator restarted the pipeline, but Joe McMillan, a company vice
president, defended the worker's actions.
   The company summary did not mention the faulty leak-detection
system; McMillan said only that the operator, whom he would not
identify, had noticed ``erratic'' signals from one system that
detected the leak after a malfunction in an automatic valve and
meter disabled another shutdown system.
   ``We're still trying to chase down the erratic signals,'' he
said.
   McMillan said the operator restarted the pipeline because the
system appeared to be normal on pipeline monitors. Typically, he
said, a plant operator restarts the flow of oil after a shutdown to
confirm there is a problem.
   McMillan said the plant operator did not get a confirmation of
the problem each of the three times that he restarted the system.
The third time, however, he decided against resuming the flow of
oil.
   The oil oozed through a gash in an underwater pipeline for six
hours before the pipeline was finally shut down, the summary said.
The cause of the crack hasn't been determined, and Exxon plans to
remove the pipeline next week for metallurgical testing.
   Ash complained that Exxon's safety procedures ``don't even begin
to meet the basic housekeeping needs of a major organization that's
passing this much oil from one facility to another under a
metropolitan water body.''
   The pipeline runs beneath the Arthur Kill between Exxon's Bayway
Refinery in Linden and a company distribution terminal in Bayonne.
   McMillan said the internal report, released to state and federal
investigators, is preliminary.
   The summary, released a week after the spill, ended corporate
silence that public officials had criticized as stonewalling.
   A New Jersey grand jury is investigating Exxon for possible
violations of the state ocean-pollution law in the spill, which
fouled ecologically sensitive marshland, killed at least 150 birds
and partially closed the shipping channel.
   Exxon also was involved in the nation's largest oil spill, the
grounding last March of the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska, in which
more than 10 million gallons of crude spilled.

<HEAD>France To Become First Western Power To Reopen Kabul Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France will reopen its embassy in Afghanistan,
becoming the first major Western power to do so since a U.S.-led
exodus just before the Soviet army withdrew last year, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said today.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
embassy would be headed by a charge d'affaires. He said the
diplomat had not yet been named and a date for the reopening was
not yet set.
   The announcement was first made Tuesday in Islamabad by Edwige
Avice, France's deputy foreign minister, who said the decision had
``no political significance.''
   Speaking to reporters during an official visit, Mrs. Avice said
the action should not be considered support for the existing Kabul
regime and noted that Pakistan _ a strong supporter of the
anti-government rebels _ has kept its Kabul embassy open.
   The United States, Britain and other countries withdrew their
diplomatic personnel from Kabul before the February 1989 withdrawal
of Soviet forces, citing fears the capital might be overrun by
anti-government guerrillas.
   In the past year, the Afghan government has shown greater
staying power than expected. Although Kabul has come under rocket
attacks, it has not proved especially dangerous for the diplomatic
personnel who remained.
   Nevertheless, Western countries were reluctant to return to
Kabul for that could be seen as conceding that the U.S.-backed
rebels were not close to defeating the government of President
Najib, which Moscow continues to support.
   The New York Times reported in today's editions that the French
decision came over U.S. objections.
   Reports that France was planning to return diplomats to Kabul
came to light months ago, and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
raised the matter with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas in St. Martin
on Dec. 16, the Times said.
   ``We explained that we don't recognize this government, that we
consider it an illegitimate government and we shouldn't be sending
in diplomats because that gives the impression of business as
usual,'' the newspaper quoted a State Department official as saying.
   Moslem rebels have been seeking to overthrow the Kabul
government since Communists seized power in an April 1978 coup. The
Soviets intervened in December 1979 but were unable to end the
insurgency, pulling out after 15,000 Soviet troops were killed.

<HEAD>ACLU Says Some Detroit Students Should Be Searched for Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN DESMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union presented a
plan to the school board advocating searches of specific students
suspected of carrying weapons. Board members and a parents' group
welcomed it.
   The ACLU, which had sued the school district over random sweeps
for weapons, gave the Detroit Board of Education a 13-point
proposal on how to boost security without stepping on students'
rights.
   ``I'm extremely pleased and enthused that the ACLU made the
decision to be more pro-active,'' Board President Lawrence C.
Patrick said after receiving the proposal Tuesday. ``They're not
only helping us identify the problems, they're helping us identify
positive solutions.''
   The group Black Parents for a Quality Education also applauded
the plan, which was drafted by an ACLU task force and referred to a
school board committee for review.
   ``What we see now is the ACLU reaching out a hand to the
board,'' group spokeswoman Helen Moore said. ``I don't think (the
ACLU) is changing their position, I think they're trying to qualify
the issues and qualify the rights of students.''
   As the number of the guns and knives seized from the 171,000
students in the district has risen, district officials have called
for more security.
   But the ACLU challenged sweep searches in a 1987 lawsuit against
the school district. Leonard Grossman, president of the ACLU's
metropolitan Detroit chapter, said the legal action forced schools
to give advance notice of searches and draft a policy on how
searches would be conducted.
   The ACLU considers random, mass searches ``an ad hoc and panicky
way of dealing with the problem,'' said Howard Simon, the group's
executive director for Michigan.
   ``The district's own records show that searching specific
students based on specific tips is 10 times as effective as the
mass searches.''
   Thirty-one guns were confiscated from students between Aug. 28
and Nov. 30, compared with 24 for the period last year.
   Searches of specific individuals are one part of the ACLU plan,
but its main thrust, Grossman said, is teaching the democratic
process to students.
   ``We can't lower the level of violence in schools unless we
teach students how to live in a democratic society,'' said
Grossman. The ACLU recommends a speakers' bureau and field trips to
law-enforcement agencies to accomplish that goal.
   Other proposals include using police cadets, parent patrols and
other volunteers to bolster security in and around schools;
expanding the district's anonymous hot-line program to get tips on
students carrying weapons; and setting up alternative schools for
students expelled for weapons violations.

   Firecrackers didn't work, neither did rubber
bullets. Now scientists hope a little romance might make sea lions
forget about the easy catch at the Ballard Locks.
   For years, sea lions migrating from California have parked just
outside the locks and adjacent fish ladder, through which salmon
and steelhead trout migrate on their way to spawning beds in
streams and rivers that feed Lake Washington.
   The sea lions have devastated steelhead runs. Last year, only
700 of the fish made it past the sea lions, wildlife officials say.
   Fisheries officials, noting that only male sea lions make the
winter trek to Washington, want to carry the sea lions back to the
Channel Islands off Southern California where female sea lions
linger.
   ``Maybe these transplanted males will develop other interests
aside from returning to the Puget Sound area to eat steelhead,''
said Joe Scordino of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
   Even if romance doesn't bloom, it would take the sea lions more
than a month to swim back to Washington, meaning they would miss
the peak steelhead run of mid-February to mid-March, Scordino said.
   Fisheries officials are waiting to see if Congress approves the
$150,000 to $175,000 the program will require. If money is
approved, they also must convince California officials the sea
lions will do no harm there.
   ``First we have to get the money and then we will worry about an
agreement with California,'' Scordino said.
   The marine mammals have caused problems for the fisheries of
both states since their numbers began to multiply after passage of
the Marine Mammals Protection Act of 1972. Scientists say there now
are more than 177,000 sea lions.
   Last year, 39 were captured at the locks, which separate Puget
Sound from the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Two died and the rest
were driven to Long Beach Peninsula near the Oregon line and
deposited back in the sea.
   But a few days later, 13 of the animals, each weighing 500 to
600 pounds, were back at the locks, gorging themselves on steelhead.
   In recent years fisheries officials have tried scare tactics by
using firecrackers, rubber bullets and taped recordings of Orca
whales, the animals' natural predators.
   They've also tried harassing them by boat, tossing them
foul-tasting fish, and erecting nets to keep them away from the
locks. Nothing has worked.

<HEAD>West Germans Refuse To Return Key Figure In East German Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A West Berlin prosecutor freed East Germany's
former top foreign trader after refusing to extradite him on fraud
charges, saying the man could unfairly wind up facing treason
charges in his homeland.
   Treason carries a maximum penalty of death in the Communist
nation.
   Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, wanted for alleged embezzlement
and illegal weapons dealings abroad, was released from a West
Berlin jail on Tuesday, said prosecutor Dietrich Schultz.
   Schalck-Golodkowski had been in custody since he turned himself
in to West Berlin authorities on Dec. 6.
   Schultz said East Germany's leaders had failed to ease concerns
that ``further charges, such as that of treason, could be hidden
behind the accusations of massive embezzlement.''
   Schultz also said it ultimately became clear that the East
German accusations against Schalck-Golodkowski, 61, apparently
related to another former top official, whom he did not name.
   East German authorities, who demanded Schalck-Golodkowski's
extradition, expressed dismay about the West Berlin decision, said
ADN, the nation's official news agency, adding that an
international warrant for his arrest would stay in effect.
   Also Tuesday, East Germany's official news agency ADN said
former Communist Party leader Egon Krenz quit his parliament seat,
his last public office.
   Krenz stepped down as party leader on Dec. 3, after just six
weeks in office, because of mounting criticism of the party and his
ties to hard-line leader Erich Honecker
   Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 after East Germans took to the
streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand an end to
authoritarian one-party rule.
   ADN said East Germany's environment minister, Hans Reichelt, 65,
also quit, citing his age. Opposition groups have severely attacked
ministry policies, saying they have turned East Germany into one of
Europe's most polluted countries.
   Meanwhile, Franz Schoenhuber, head of West Germany's
extreme-right Republican Party, told a news conference in West
Berlin that the organization soon will set up electoral groups in
East Germany.
   The party has been branded a neo-Nazi group by East German's
Communists.
   ``We will find ways and means to get tons of campaign material
into the German Democratic Republic,'' said Schoenhuber, a former
Nazi Waffen SS soldier.
   He predicted that at least 10 percent of the voters in free
elections promised for May 6 would vote for candidates favored by
the Republicans.
   That figure would give the Republicans a prominent role among
the numerous factions jockeying for control of East Germany.
   East Germany's Communists have warned of right-wing extremism
and have vowed to keep the Republicans out of the elections.
   The Communists themselves are fighting to maintain their still
considerable hold on East Germany.
   They still control the nation's media, major meeting places and
supplies of essentials like paper. But shortages, low worker morale
and resignations from the party are challenging their dominance.
   The Communist Party newspaper Berliner Zeitung reminded its
readers Tuesday that opposition groups are running for the first
time and claimed many candidates feel the need to almost shove
opponents out of the way.
   ``All this leads to the fear that it could get especially rough
in the coming weeks,'' the Berliner Zeitung said, referring to the
campaign.
   The newspaper's commentary said all sides should reach a
``fairness agreement'' specifying campaign conduct.

<TEXT>
   A powerful bomb planted by Sikh
separatists exploded in the office of a senior Hindu police
official in Punjab today, killing him and three others on the spot,
police said.
   The bomb had a timing device and was hidden in a wooden foot
rest below the desk of Senior Superintendent of Police Govind Ram,
they said.
   The blast occurred at Jalandhar, 50 miles southeast of the Sikh
holy city of Amritsar.
   Ram was on the ``hit list'' of Sikh militants campaigning for an
independent Sikh nation in Punjab state. The militants had accused
him of torturing Sikhs who were in police custody.
   Jalandhar Superintendent of Police Suresh Araro said the blast
killed Ram and three other policemen. At least 20 other people,
mostly policemen, were injured.
   The blast was so powerful that the small building housing Ram's
office collapsed. ``It was a very powerful time bomb,'' Araro said
when reached by telephone. ``We normally do not see these things in
the hands of the terrorists.''
   Ram's 18-year-old son, Rajen, was killed by Sikh separatists
last year in revenge for the policeman's alleged actions against
Sikh militants.
   Today's deaths brought the total number of people killed by Sikh
militants in the Punjab in the first 10 days of this year to 69.
Last year 1,821 deaths were blamed on the militants, whose violent
separatist campaign began in 1982.
   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people, but they
have a slight majority in Punjab, a prosperous northern farming
state.
   Sikh militants allege they are discriminated by Hindus, who make
up 82 percent of the nationwide population.

   The release of jailed black

government-run radio said today in the strongest signal yet that
his freedom is imminent.
   The editorial by the South Africa Broadcasting Corp. also said
Mandela, the country's best known black leader, can play a central

   ``It has been clear for some months that it is only a matter of
time before Mr. Mandela's release is announced,'' the radio said.
``Moreover, by identifying himself with the ideals of peaceful
development he has redefined his position.''
   In recent weeks, there has been almost daily speculation in the
media on Mandela's release, and President F.W. de Klerk is widely
expected to make an announcement on Mandela's status when he opens
Parliament on Feb. 1.
   For most of Mandela's 27 years in prison, the white-led
government has portrayed him and other members of his outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement as terrorists and
communists.
   But recently it has described Mandela in favorable terms, in an
apparent attempt to prepare the white community for his release.
   ``He would be in a position to make an important contribution to
the creation of the conditions in which (black-white) talks could
get under way,'' the SABC said.
   Mandela, 71, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   He has refused to renounce the ANC's guerrilla campaign, saying
he will do so only if the organization is legalized and South
Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation is dismantled.
   The Citizen, a pro-government daily, said a planned visit within
the next month by U.S. political leader Jesse Jackson may affect
the date of Mandela's release.
   ``The government does not want to give Mr. Jackson, an
arch-critic of South Africa, any kudos as a result of the release
of Mandela, which would be the case if an announcement were made
during his visit,'' the Citizen said, citing unidentified
government sources.
   The government has said it will grant Jackson a visa, but no
dates for his trip have been announced.
   Mandela has received a steady stream of visitors in recent
weeks, ranging from Cabinet ministers to prominent anti-apartheid
leaders. He met Dec. 13 with de Klerk at the presidential office.
   Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, said the
speculation on Mandela's release is filled ``with an expectancy
that borders on religious fervor, as though it were the coming of a
savior.''
   ``The reality is likely to be much more complicated,'' the
editorial said. ``Mandela's release must be seen as part of the
jockeying, if not the struggle for power, within the anti-apartheid
forces.''
   De Klerk wants to open negotiations on a new constitution with
black leaders, but says the ANC must commit itself to peaceful
solutions before it can participate.
   The ANC, in a statement Monday marking its 78th anniversary,
said its guerrilla campaign remained an important part of its
struggle for black political rights.
   The nationwide unrest that rocked the black townships from 1984
to 1986 has subsided and the ANC's guerrilla campaign has been
largely dormant for more than a year. However, the country remains
under a 43-month-old state of emergency.

   A judge postponed a bail hearing for Manuel Noriega
and ordered that the ousted Panamanian dictator not be moved from
Miami without the court's permission while he awaits a
drug-trafficking trial.
   Judge William Hoeveler said during a hearing that federal
marshals must submit any plans to transfer Noriega, whom sources
say has been held in a special area below the courthouse since
arriving in Miami last Thursday.
   The U.S. District judge also set a Jan. 26 bail hearing for
Noriega, who attended Tuesday's one-hour session dressed in dark
slacks and a light-blue shirt.
   The session was held on a motion by the U.S. attorney's office
for a bail hearing after defense attorneys last week waived an
immediate bail hearing at Noriega's arraignment on drug trafficking
charges.
   But Hoeveler postponed the hearing at the request of defense
attorneys, who said they needed more time.
   The judge said defense attorneys would be able to respond to any
request to move Noriega. But requests and responses concerning any
move will be sealed.
   ``This case is at its beginning,'' Hoeveler said, ``and it is
very important the defendant is entitled ... to whatever time he
needs to prepare his defense.''
   Defense attorney Steven Kollin told Hoeveler he opposes any move
of Noriega, who was toppled by the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   ``I don't want a change, my client doesn't want a change,''
Kollin said.
   Prosecutor Dexter Lehtinen did not say if he wanted Noriega to
remain in Miami, noting that marshals will decide if he should be
transferred.
   It could not be determined whether marshals made any such
request after the hearing because of the order to keep them
confidential.
   U.S. marshals and Noriega's attorneys refuse to disclose his
whereabouts, although meetings with defense counsel have been held
in the courthouse.
   The New York Times, quoting an unidentified source, reported
Tuesday that Noriega probably would be moved from Miami, most
likely to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta.
   But Angie Sheffer, spokeswoman for the Atlanta prison, said no
preparations were being made for Noriega's arrival.
   Federal officials believe the Metropolitan Correctional Center,
a federal prison near Miami, does not offer adequate security to
hold Noriega, the Times said.
   Noriega's quarters below the courthouse reportedly are lavish
compared to the spartan room at the Vatican's papal nunciate in
Panama City, where Noriega took refuge for 10 days following the
U.S. invasion.
   Sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press that Noriega was being held in an area principally
used for the federal witness protection program.
   It includes a bedroom, living room with a television and radio,
and kitchen, although Noreiga's food has been brought from the
outside.
   Kollin and co-counsel Frank Rubino said they have met daily with
Noriega, charged with taking $4.6 million in bribes from Colombian
cocaine traffickers to turn his nation into a way station for
smugglers.
   They said they will likely challenge the court's jurisdiction
over Noriega, who they claim is a head of state and subject to
diplomatic immunity from prosecution. Defense attorneys also claim
the February 1988 grand jury indictment of Noriega was politically
motivated and the invasion violated international law.
   The grand jury indicted Noriega and 15 others on drug
trafficking charges.
   One of them, Eduardo Pardo, 44, pleaded innocent Tuesday before
a federal magistrate. Pardo, accused of transporting drug money
from the United States to Panama, is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center.

<HEAD>Ex-Junkie Acquitted of Distributing Needles in AIDS Prevention
Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former junkie who later attended Yale University
said he would continue his brand of AIDS prevention work after a
judge cleared him of a charge of distributing clean needles and
syringes to drug addicts.
   Jon Parker, 35, was acquitted of one count of distributing the
materials after a one-day, non-jury trial in Boston Municipal Court.
   Parker said the judge's decision was courageous.
   Asked if he would continue distributing needles, he said: ``I
don't want to flout the law. Let me just say the work will
continue.''
   When pressed, he said he would give out a clean needle on his
way home after the trial if a drug addict offered to turn in a
dirty one.
   Before Tuesday's trial, Parker said he hoped to change a state
requirement for a prescription to buy a hypodermic needle.
   His lawyer, Arnold Abelow, said the ruling should send a message
to the Legislature, where proposals to legalize needle possession
and to establish a needle-exchange program in Boston have bogged
down.
   Judge Sally A. Kelly said the facts showed Parker possessed the
needles but that possession, even without prescription, is ``not in
and of itself evil.''
   Prosecutors said the decision conflicted with law.
   ``The law is pretty specific, and her verdict was contrary to
the facts,'' said Assistant District Attorney Mary Orfanello.
   Parker is founder of a 50-member group called the AIDS Brigade,
comprised of former Yale graduate students as well as former
addicts and convicts. It was formed about five years ago and
distributes AIDS education materials, bleach to clean needles, and
syringes in Boston, New York City, New Haven, Conn., and New Jersey.
   Among those who testified in support of Parker's program were a
British physician in charge of a needle exchange program in
Liverpool, England, and the AIDS adviser to Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Flynn endorsed a needle exchange program that was rejected by
the City Council last year.
   Critics of needle exchange programs maintain it encourages drug
abuse.
   Parker has said his background makes him well qualified to bring
AIDS prevention to the streets.
   He shot heroin as a teen-ager and robbed drug stores for money
and supplies. At 17, he served time in prison, earning his high
school equivalency diploma in jail. A month after his 1974 release,
he was caught violating parole and was allowed to check into a drug
rehabilitation center.
   He later entered Hampshire College in Amherst, where he studied
biology, and then went to Yale's School of Epidemiology and Public
Health.
   Last year, the nation's first full-scale, government-sponsored
needle exchange program to fight the spread of AIDS was approved by
the Tacoma-Pierce County Board of Health in Washington state.

   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
nervous European trading early tpdau amid signs of declining
cooperation between the Group of Seven, the world's leading
industrialized nations.
   Gold, boosted by the dollar's weakness, rose by more than $2 an
ounce in Europe.
   Dealers said the G-7 nations _ the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada _ appear more intent on
pursuing national interests than common goals of steadying exchange
rates with the aim of reducing inflation.
   ``The G-7 isn't working the way it used to,'' said a dealer in
Frankfurt, West Germany. ``West Germany wants a strong mark, but
other countries don't want a realignment. The Japanese want a
higher yen but don't want higher interest rates.''
   The market also was unsettled by the dearth of U.S. statistical
indicators being published this week, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.33 Japanese yen to a closing 145.30
yen. But later, in London, it retreated to 145.15 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6697 West German marks, down from 1.6823
   _1.5120 Swiss francs, down from 1.5260
   _5.6887 French francs, down from 5.7305

   In London, the British pound rose to a five-month high of
$1.6631, up from $1.6540 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $405.35 a troy ounce, up
from $403.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $405.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $405.90, up from $403.50 bid late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.82 to close at a bid $404.08.

<HEAD>Rose Kushner, Advocate for Women with Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rose Kushner, a medical writer and psychologist
and forceful advocate for women with breast cancer, has died of the
disease at age 60.
   Kushner, who resided in Kensington, Md., died Sunday, The New
York Times reported today.
   She gained national fame in 1975, with the publication of ``Why
Me? What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer to Save Her
Life,'' an account of her own battle with the disease.
   Breast cancer specialists initially rejected many of the steps
she advocated, including less radical surgery, which now are common.
   Kushner focused her energies on the breast cancer crusade in
1974, when she discovered a lump in her breast but refused to
submit to the then-routine ``one-step'' procedure.
   In the mid-70s, a woman undergoing treatment would be
anesthetized, the lump removed for biopsy, and, if malignant, the
breast would be removed. The patient would not know until she awoke
whether the breast was gone.
   Kushner fought against the one-step procedure, arguing that
women needed time after a diagnosis to find the best surgeon. After
18 phone calls, she finally found a general surgeon who would
remove just the lump.
   Now, the one-step procedure is no longer used.
   ``She is probably the single most important person in leading to
this major change in breast surgery,'' Dr. Bruce A. Chabner once
said. Chabner is the director of the division of cancer treatment
at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. ``I don't think
the public would have accepted it or even known about it if she had
not been so persistent in her efforts.''
   Kushner founded and was director of the Breast Cancer Advisory
Center, through which she provided women with information about
their options when faced with the disease.
   This year, she was scheduled to be awarded the James Ewing award
from the Society of Surgical Oncology for the outstanding
contribution by a non-physician to the fight against cancer.
   Her husband, Harvey Kushner, called this ``poetic justice.'' In
1975 the society's members had booed her off the stage after she
challenged their standard procedures.
   Kushner is survived by her husband; her sons, Gantt of Silver
Spring, Md, and Todd of Rockville Md.; a daughter, Lesley Kushner
of San Francisco, and three brothers.

<HEAD>Ousted Communist Leader Under Investigation for Alleged Misuse of
Funds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special parliamentary panel has found
grounds to investigate ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov for
possible prosecution on charges of illegally stashing state funds
in Swiss bank accounts.
   Lyuben Koulishev, a member of the panel set up after Zhivkov's
Nov. 10 ouster, said on television Tuesday night the committee has
enough information to pursue an investigation against Zhivkov.
   ``The huge amount of state money used to publish numerous books
by the former Bulgarian leader gives grounds to bring a case
against him,'' the state news agency BTA quoted the panel as saying.
   The panel is looking into abuses of official power under the
Zhivkov government.
   No figure was given on the amount of money Zhivkov may have in
Swiss banks.
   Koulishev said the Foreign Ministry is in contact with the banks.
   Little is known about Zhivkov's day-to-day life after his
ouster. There have been rumors that his movements are restricted.
There have also been rumors he has undergone medical tests.
   Zhivkov's hometown is Pravets, about an hour's drive from Sofia.
He is reported to have more than 20 other residences as well, and
it is unclear where he is currently living.
   At a meeting in Sofia in November, the ruling Communist Party's
Politburo decided to turn over to the public a series of official
residences and hunting retreats mostly used by Zhivkov and his
guests.
   At least 13 plush official residences were turned over to
charitable, student and tourist organizations, including one at
Pravets, BTA reported.
   In addition, some six hunting retreats that had been used by
Zhivkov and his friends and guests were made available to the
ministry of agriculture and to an organization promoting
international hunting tourism.
   Petar Mladenov, who replaced Zhivkov on Nov. 10, has promised to
steer Bulgaria out of its Stalinist past and corruption and into a
democratic future.
   But a fascinating account of Zhivkov's ouster indicates the
former leader, who had been in power for 34 years, did not go
willingly and probably still enjoys the support of some Communists.
   According to Ventsel Raichev, a Bulgarian journalist who wrote
the story for the Soviet weekly Moscow News, Zhivkov had resisted
all calls for reform in Bulgaria and had decided to crush
opposition inside and outside the party.
   Security forces were placed on alert on the eve of the Nov. 10
Central Committee meeting that ousted Zhivkov, the account said.
   Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov and two other senior officials,
all comrades of Zhivkov's in a World War II partisan group, then
talked to Zhivkov privately and urged him to quit, Raichev wrote.
   Zhivkov was ``virtually escorted'' to a Politburo meeting that
same evening to prevent him contacting close aides, the journalist
said.
   At the Politburo meeting, Zhivkov said he would resign, but
tried to block Mladenov's nomination by proposing Premier Georgi
Atanassov, a more conservative Communist, as his successor, Moscow
News said.
   Atanassov, who has retained the premiership, declined, paving
the way for Mladenov's nomination, the weekly added.

   Antonio Bueti won $35 million Lotto jackpot,
then went to work and acted as if it was just another day at the
factory.
   ``I went in just to be funny, to see how I feel, a millionaire
working the assembly line,'' Bueti, 49, told reporters Tuesday, a
day after going to his job as an assembly line worker at General
Motors in North Tarrytown and claiming his winnings.
   The prize was the biggest New York Lotto jackpot ever won by one
individual. The ticket was one of 11 bought by Bueti, who chose his
numbers at random.
   Bueti said he looked around at his fellow workers. ``I was
thinking I hope they win someday,'' said the native of Italy who
lives in Bedford Hills, about 35 miles north of New York City.
   His ticket was validated Monday, a day after a man had concocted
an elaborate hoax in which an actress reported she had won.
   Bueti learned he was the winner on Sunday. He said he was never
worried about the false claim after confirming his ticket by
repeatedly calling the lottery information line.
   ``I heard about it. I knew it was nothing to worry about,'' he
said.
   He added he was unsure whether he would quit the job that pays
him $30,000 to $35,000 a year _ pocket change compared with the 21
annual payments of about $1.2 million after taxes.
   Bueti attended the news conference with his wife of 24 years,
Francesca. Both said they were unsure how they would spend their
money, but they knew their lives would never be the same.
   ``I have a lot of dreams. Now I'm glad all my dreams come
true,'' Mrs. Bueti said.

   The principal of a Roman Catholic high school
says a student bride was expelled from classes because her marriage
set a bad example.
   But the teen-ager says she wants an apology and to be readmitted
with all student privileges, including the right to go to the
senior prom.
   ``I am not doing anything wrong. I just don't feel guilty,''
Elizabeth Valeri, 17, said Tuesday.
   ``I love him and he loves me,'' she said of her new husband,
20-year-old Xavier, whom she married over Maria High School's
Christmas holiday recess.
   Elizabeth was kicked out of classes last week after a picture of
her and the groom appeared in the Sun-Times as the first couple in
Cook County to marry in 1990.
   She said she was told the day after the publication that she was
``being terminated,'' wouldn't be allowed to graduate and should
find another school.
   She was given tutoring sessions away from the other students
Monday and Tuesday to prepare for mid-term exams later this week.
   ``Maria High School endorses and encourages the sacrament of
marriage within the Catholic Church and by men and women who are
properly prepared and who have reached the age of majority,'' said
Sister Grace Ann, principal of the school.
   ``Marriage outside the church and prior to high school
graduation, while legal, does not constitute an appropriate example
for other students here at Maria,'' she said in a statement late
Tuesday.
   Sister Grace Ann said the school would continue ``to work with
Elizabeth and her family to find some alternatives for further
study in an appropriate and mutually acceptable way.''
   The statement did not elaborate.
   Sister Grace Ann has said that Elizabeth was being kicked out
because school policy says married students may not attend classes
at Maria. She said the policy is aimed at creating a positive
atmosphere.
   Elizabeth said she knew of the rules. ``They are rules, but are
they discriminatory _ that is the question,'' she said.
   Dressed in her school uniform and carrying her books in a
backpack, Elizabeth told reporters at a news conference that she
wants ``some kind of apology ... I want to be accepted back in
school ... I want prom, I want graduation, I want it all.''
   Elizabeth's attorney, Robert Shindler, sent a letter Tuesday to
the principal, threatening a lawsuit unless the senior is
readmitted and gets the apology she seeks. He added, though, that
he's also trying to find another Catholic school that might accept
Elizabeth.
   Elizabeth said she still is living at her family's house, while
Xavier is living at his. The couple doesn't plan to live together
until later this year, a spokeswoman for Shindler said.
   ``It's just a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship,'' Elizabeth
said of the relationship now, ``just a legal document.''

<TEXT>
   Hong Kong Governor Sir David Wilson arrived today
for talks aimed at easing tensions between China and Britain and
reviving flagging confidence in the future of Hong Kong.
   Wilson, making his first trip to Beijing since the bloody June
suppression of the pro-democracy movement, was to meet with a
Chinese leadership that has been increasingly firm in opposing
political reform in the British colony.
   During his three-day stay, he was to talk with Premier Li Peng
and Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Nan Ji Pengfei, head of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office in the State Council.
   Wilson said upon arriving that he hoped he would have an
opportunity to explain the views of Hong Kong's people and ``try to
re-establish a dialogue which is so important for dealing with the
various issues we have facing us.''
   ``We need to have a correct understanding of the position of
both sides so that we can find ways to deal with any particular
problems that we face,'' he said.
   The visit will be a last chance for Britain to express its views
before the final meeting in Canton next week of the
Chinese-dominated body drawing up the laws that will govern Hong
Kong after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Relations between China and Britain have deteriorated since the
army marched on Beijing June 3-4 and crushed the student-led
pro-democracy movement, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   China has criticized Britain for permitting pro-democracy
activities in Hong Kong, which it has said are aimed at
overthrowing the Chinese government, and for trying to
``internationalize'' debate over the colony's future.
   The Chinese government on Dec. 30 also accused Britain of a
``gross violation'' of past agreements in its decision to give
50,000 Hong Kong families the right of abode in Britain before 1997.
   The British decision was aimed at providing guarantees for the
future of Hong Kong's most talented people, whose confidence in
life under Communist rule was badly shaken by Beijing's bloody
suppression of dissent.
   China's condemnation of the move came several weeks after Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher dispatched foreign policy adviser Sir
Percy Cradock on a secret mission to Beijing to try to defuse
controversies between the two sides.
   Wilson was likely to discuss China's objections to the
introduction of more democratic government in Hong Kong, which
Britain says is crucial to the stability of the colony.
   Vice Foreign Minister Zhou, at the airport to greet Wilson,
acknowledged that ``we have had some problems and this is what we
don't like to see.'' He said he believed that through sincere and
friendly talks ''there's no problem we can't solve.''

   An ``Indiana Jones'' stunt attraction and
a 1930s-style Hollywood backlot attraction are among possibilities
for what may be Disneyland's biggest expansion in its 35-year
history, park employees said.
   Disney officials are keeping mum about specifics of the
expansion plans until an announcement Friday by Disney Chairman
Michael Eisner.
   The expansion is in ``keeping with Walt Disney's founding
philosophy that the park will never be completed as long as there
was imagination left in the world,'' Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth
told the Orange County Register in a report published Tuesday.
   ``It involves the next 10 years, but I can't tell you anymore,''
he said.
   But employees who last week were shown preliminary plans by
President Richard Nunis told the newspaper the park plans to build
two new theme areas _ Mickey's Birthday Land and a partial
reproduction of a Hollywood studio tour attraction at Walt Disney
World in Florida.
   Those plans also included a stunt attraction based on the
``Indiana Jones'' movies, and rides based on the animated movie
character Roger Rabbit and the Muppets, they said. Disney bought
the rights to the Muppet characters last year.
   ``They said none of this was guaranteed,'' Disney employee
Christy Bauer said. ``But I got the impression that it was probably
going to happen because everything was really detailed.''
   In their presentation to employees, Disneyland officials gave no
construction timetables or cost estimates.
   It would be the first major expansion since Bear Country, now
called Critter Country, was added in 1972. Disney has about 78
acres available for expansion in Anaheim, including about 30 acres
within the park.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from Premier Li Peng's speech
Wednesday lifting martial law in Beijing. The text was translated
by the official Xinhua News Agency.
   Comrades and compatriots.
   I am here tonight making an important announcement: the State
Council has issued an order on lifting as of January 11, 1990, the
martial law imposed in parts of Beijing.
   This is a big event of concern to the people of the capital and
the whole country. The lifting of the martial law imposed in parts
of Beijing indicates that the situation in the capital and the
country as a whole has become stable, social order has returned to
normal, and a great victory has been won in checking the turmoil
and quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion.
   This fact shows once again to the whole country and the whole
world that the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government and
the Chinese people are capable of running their own affairs well
and maintaining a long-term stable political, economic and social
development. No matter what may happen in the world, we shall
unswervingly follow the socialist road....
   We all remember what it was like before martial law was imposed
in parts of Beijing. At that time, school classes were suspended,
traffic disrupted, workers blocked on their way to work, order of
production and life severely damaged and the capital in a state of
anarchy....
   In those circumstances, had the government not taken the
resolute measure of imposing martial law and stopping the turmoil
and riots in time, the fruits of revolution earned by several
generations through protracted struggle, the achievements made in
the four decades of socialist construction and in the decade-long
reform and opening to the outside world would have been destroyed,
our country would have been split up, and hundreds of millions of
people would have again fallen into the abyss of misery.
   Developments of the situation in the past seven months or so
since the imposition of martial law have shown that our country is
stable politically, economically and socially, production and life
are in good order, commodity supplies are sufficient and people
live and work in peace and contentment....
   The officers and men of the martial law enforcement units of the
people's Liberation Army and the vast numbers of the cadres and men
of the police and the armed police have resolutely carried out the
decision of the Party Central Committee, the State Council and the
Central Military Commission and performed immortal historic feats
in maintaining order and security in the capital and in defending
the Communist Party leadership and the socialist system. For this,
the people will never forget them....
   The imposition of martial law in parts of Beijing won support
and backing from vast numbers of workers, peasants, intellectuals,
students, cadres at all levels and urban residents in the capital
as well as from the people of all nationalities in the country.
During the martial law period, there were lots of moving deeds in
which troops loved civilians, civilians supported troops,
disregarding their own safety and fighting in unity....
   We have made tremendous achievements in reform and opening to
the outside world over the past decade. Practice shows that the
principle for reform and opening to the outside world is absolutely
correct and it will remain unchanged because it has been rooted in
China's soil and in the hearts of the people....
   At present, some unstable factors still exist in our society.
The hostile forces in and outside the country will not give up
their attempt to subvert the socialist system in our country. There
are some temporary difficulties our country needs to overcome in
improving the national economy. We must have a sober understanding
of this....
   It is our conviction that no matter how the international
situation changes, our people will, under the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party, steadily push ahead the great cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<HEAD>Computer Software Declared Subject to Unfair Trade Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department has ruled tentatively
that computer software is merchandise subject to unfair trade laws.
   In a preliminary ruling announced Monday, the department said
imports of computer-aided software engineering products from
Singapore are being subsidized and thus are subject to
countervailing duties.
   The department pointed out that the software is sold as a
pre-packaged product which can be purchased off-the-shelf, rather
than as an intangible such as electronically transmitted material.
   The government of Singapore had argued that the software is not
within the scope of the countervailing duty law because it is not
merchandise.
   The software is used in the disk operating sytems of personal
computers.
   If the preliminary ruling is confirmed by further Commerce
investigation, the government will impose countervailing duties to
offset what was said to be an estimated net subsidy rate from
Singapore of 15.25 percent.
   Countervailing duties are placed on subsidized imports to offset
their price advantage. Pending the final determination, due by
March 26, the Customs Department will require a cash deposit or
bond on all imports of the software.
   The department said the software was developed by the
Information Technology Institute, a Singapore government agency,
which commercialized the product by entering into a marketing
arrangement with Computer Systems Advisors, a private company.
   The department's preliminary investigation found the existence
of a subsidy because the software was developed and transferred by
Singapore to a private sector firm for a royalty insufficient to
cover the cost of developing the software.
   Ordinarily, the International Trade Commission would have to
rule separately that the subsized product materially injures or
threatens to injure U.S. industry before countervailing duties are
imposed.
   However, Singapore is not a member of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade and an ITC ruling thus is not required.
   The department's investigation was prompted by a petition filed
on behalf of the U.S. industry by Visible Systems Corp. of Waltham,
Mass.

<HEAD>Union Blames Non-Strikers For Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 striking rail
workers marched on management offices today, and union officials
accused non-strikers of an unprovoked attack that left seven dead a
day earlier.
   The union officials also accused police of standing by during
the 45-minute battle Tuesday, when at least 60 people were injured
in addition to those killed.
   The violence at a train station in Germiston, southeast of
Johannesburg, was the worst single incident in a 10-week-old strike
by black workers of the South Africa Transport Services.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions said it would seek a
court order against management and the police to restrain them from
``making further attacks on striking workers.''
   The union said non-striking workers, armed with knives and
clubs, attacked a group of strikers arriving at the station. Police
initially made no effort to intervene, the union said.
   Management denied any role in the fighting, which involved about
2,000 men. Police said that because of the large number of
combatants, the officers on duty had to wait for reinforcements
before they could break up the fighting.
   Prior to Tuesday's conflict, 10 men had been killed in
strike-related violence and several dozen railway cars destroyed by
arson.
   In Cape Town, meanwhile, more than 1,000 strikers marched today
on the offices of the Transport Services and demanded the company
enter negotiations in good faith. There was a heavy police
presence, and no incidents were reported.
   About 25,000 workers went on strike against the transport
company in early November, demanding their minimum monthly wage be
increased from $225 to $560.
   More than 22,000 strikers have been fired. The company says it
would rehire 50 percent of the fired workers, but it has not
offered a wage increase.
   The strike is illegal under legislation that bars industrial
action against essential services. The transport company employees
about 170,000 people, and runs rail and harbor operations
nationwide.

<TEXT>
   China's liberal ambassador to Hong Kong, who
once wrote an essay praising capitalism, is retiring and will be
replaced by a conservative foreign affairs official, it was
announced today.
   A Western political analyst said the move could signal a
hardening of China's attitude toward Hong Kong, a British colony
that comes under Chinese rule in 1997.
   The new ambassador will be Zhou Nan, a 62-year-old diplomat who
is vice foreign minister in charge of European affairs. Zhou is
considered a conservative and is known as a tough negotiator, the
analyst said.
   Xu Jiatun, 74, will step down by the end of this month, said Pan
Zengxi, deputy director of China's official Xinhua news agency.
   The Chinese ambassador here is actually head of Xinhua's Hong
Kong branch.
   The announcement comes during troubled times for Hong Kong and
China, whose relations are at their lowest point since the Cultural
Revolution of the 1960s.
   Relations soured in June, after the Chinese military crushed a
pro-democracy movement in Beijing, resulting in hundreds and
possibly thousands of deaths.
   The crackdown caused fears in Hong Kong that China would not
live up to its agreement to preserve the territory's free-wheeling
economic and social system for 50 years after Hong Kong reverts to
Beijing's rule.
   The most recent tussle aggravating the tension concerns the
British plan to accept up to 225,000 Hong Kong residents who want
to settle in Britain.
   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, made his first trip to
the city today since the crackdown. Arriving in China, Wilson said
he hoped to ``re-establish a dialogue which is so important for
dealing with the various issues we have facing us.''
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd comes to Hong Kong on
Saturday and will talk with Wilson about his trip.
   Xu told several leading industrialists of his retirement plan
Tuesday night at a dinner, according to a Hong Kong government
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. During the party, Xu
also said Hong Kong should not worry about losing its best and
brightest residents because there are many talented people in China
ready to take their place.
   Nearly 1,000 Hong Kong residents emigrate from the colony every
week. Interest in leaving has risen dramatically since the
crackdown.
   Xu became head of the Hong Kong Xinhua branch in 1983 and
cultivated ties to the business community.
   In 1988, he wrote an essay praising capitalism in the
development of Hong Kong. A member of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party, Xu was known for his independent style and
for possessing sufficient power to carry out initiatives on his own.
   The Western analyst said Zhou, who does not occupy a high party
position, appears to be weaker than Xu and thereby his leadership
in Hong Kong will closely follow the prevailing hard-line in
Beijing.
   Zhou is an old hand at Hong Kong affairs, having worked in 1984
on the agreement with Britain concerning Hong Kong's future.
   Western sources have said China was considering appointing Ye
Xuanping, the governor of China's prosperous Guangdong province, to
the Xinhua post. But Ye apparently resisted the move, they said.
   Ye, a leading reformer, has also successfully opposed plans to
transfer him to Beijing where he could be better controlled, the
sources said.

   Premier Li Peng today lifted martial law in
Beijing more than seven months after imposing it to quell
pro-democracy protests. The action was largely cosmetic because
strict laws banning dissent remain in force.
   The announcement, which takes effect at midnight in the capital,
appeared at least partly intended to ease foreign criticism and
allow the resumption of loans and high-level exchanges halted after
the government's bloody suppression of the reform movement in June.
   Li said he represented the ruling Communist Party and government
in thanking the People's Liberation Army for restoring order,
saying, ``The people will never forget.
   ``China is now stable politically, economically and socially.
Production and lives are in good order, commodity supplies are
sufficient, people live and work in peace and contentment,'' he
said.
   His 10-minute speech, made this morning, was broadcast on
national radio and television tonight, a day after authorities
originally planned to make the announcement. The reason for the
delay was not immediately clear.
   The government may have been moving cautiously to gauge public
reaction to the news and allow itself flexibility in case of
attempted anti-government protests.
   The official radio followed Li's speech with an editorial
praising the move and a program of triumphant martial music.
   Li wore a dark gray Western-style suit and sat at a desk, his
hands folded in front of him most of the time.
   His calm manner was in sharp contrast to his agitated,
arm-waving delivery when he announced the night of May 19 that the
government would not permit the student-led protests to continue.
The next day, he signed the order imposing martial law in central
Beijing, for the first time since the People's Republic was founded
40 years ago.
   When students refused to quit their occupation of central
Tiananmen Square, the army shot its way to the square on June 3-4
and dispersed them, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   Li said today that martial law could be lifted because the army
had fulfilled its task, apparently trying to avoid any appearance
that the government was bowing to Western pressure.
   ``A great victory has been won in checking the turmoil and
quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion,'' he said. ``This
shows once again that the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese
government and the Chinese people are capable of running their own
affairs well. ...
   ``No matter what may happen in the world, we shall unswervingly
advance along the socialist road,'' he said.
   Western diplomats linked the lifting of martial law to the
December visit of U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft,
who sought an easing of China's hard-line political policy in
exchange for normalization of bilateral relations.
   The move would enable President Bush to say that the
controversial Scowcroft visit and Bush's easing of other sanctions
against China paid off.
   However, even without martial law Chinese security forces have
wide authority to quell dissent. The government passed a law in
November banning all but pro-government demonstrations, and strikes
and putting up political posters are already illegal.
   The constitution forbids any action that might undermine the
socialist system.
   Well-placed Chinese sources had said they were assured that Li
would make the announcement Tuesday night, and that martial law
would be ended at midnight Tuesday. Some work units told their
employees to watch the Tuesday evening news, and Chinese reporters
said they waited late into the night for the official notice.
   However, Li did not record the speech until this morning. He
spoke in the Great Hall of the People, the sources said. All that
could be seen on the television was the desk at which he sat and
bookshelves behind him.
   Several people interviewed on the street said lifting martial
law would be a good move, and one said it could make it easier for
students to resume protests.
   However, most people said it would make no difference to them.
   ``It won't have any effect on most people's lives,'' said a
young woman. ``Of course, they may feel more light-hearted, to know
that martial law is gone. But that's all.''
   Soldiers brought into Beijing in June have gradually withdrawn
into walled compounds in and around the capital, but their numbers
remain far above pre-martial law levels.

   The black homeland of Transkei
is having a ``terrific'' response to a campaign offering
citizenship to wealthy Hong Kong residents seeking new homes,
according to a report today.
   Business Day, the leading financial daily, quoted Transkei
officials as saying large numbers of Hong Kong residents had
inquired about its offer of immediate citizenship in return for
investment in local business.
   ``Since we placed advertisements in the press out there, we have
been approached by many businesses and journalists interested in
the Transkei,'' Transkei official Andrew O'Connor was quoted as
saying.
   The report did not give any figures on how many Hong Kong
residents had approached the Transkei or how much investors would
be required to spend in the homeland, one of 10 in South Africa.
   The offer would give citizenship in Transkei, but not South
Africa. However, there are no border posts, so regardless of
citizenship a person can travel freely between Transkei and South
Africa.
   In recent years, many businessmen from Taiwan set up operations
in the homelands, largely to take advantage of generous government
subsidies.
   O'Connor said the homeland plans a concerted campaign to attract
more Hong Kong residents and would sponsor a stall at an upcoming
emigration fair in the British colony, the report said.
   The families of investors and key employees also would be
granted citizenship, according to the report.
   Many Hong Kong residents are eager to leave the colony before it
reverts to Chinese control in 1997.
   Transkei is located on South Africa's southeast coast and has 4
million residents. It is one of four homelands to accept nominal
independence. None of the homelands, which are poor and lacking in
resources, is recognized abroad.
   The South African government, meanwhile, has been recruiting
skilled workers from East Germany and elsewhere in Eastern Europe.

   A plan to breed Florida panthers in
captivity and then return them to the wild to save them from
extinction has won state-federal approval and captured the interest
of zoos around the state.
   Under the plan approved Tuesday by a joint panel, eight adult
panthers and 18 kittens would be removed from the wild over the
next three years, and up to six adults and 12 kittens would be
removed over the following two years.
   If the program's goals are met, panthers in the wild would
increase over two decades from the 50 big cats now roaming South
Florida to some 300 in several Southeastern states. An additional
200 would be in captivity.
   The Florida panther is a tawny brown cat that resembles a
cougar. It ranges range from 60 to more than 100 pounds.
   Without the program, the Florida panther could be extinct in 25
to 40 years, John Christian told the joint Florida Panther
Interagency Committee.
   In addition, the Florida panther could be wiped out at any time
by an outbreak of disease, said Christian, deputy regional director
of endangered wildlife for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   ``What we're proposing to do is to take animals out of the wild
to start the core of a captive breeding plan that can be used both
for increasing numbers of Florida panthers in captivity, for
preserving their genetic makeup and then second to provide stock
for reintroductions back into the wild,'' Christian said before the
four committee members voted to approve the project.
   Three zoos _ in Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa _ have expressed
an interest in participating, Christian said. Interest also has
been expressed by White Oak Plantation, a private exotic animal
breeding facility in North Florida.

   President Bush, riding high on his successes
in Panama and Malta, is trying to utilize some of that popularity
to prod a stalled domestic agenda.
   But he may run afoul of congressional election-year politics.
   Even though the ``extended hand'' Bush again is offering
Congress is a strengthened one, some analysts suggest foreign
policy triumphs don't necessarily translate into legislative
victories.
   Still, Bush advisers are urging him to strike while his ratings
in public opinion polls are high. Bush's approval rankings surged
in the aftermath of the capture of former Panamanian dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega and a successful summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The president displayed that new assertiveness in a speech
earlier this week to the American Farm Bureau in Orlando, Fla., in
which he called Democratic opponents of his capital gains tax cut
``demagogues.''
   ``It's time _ it is past time _ for Congress to tend to some of
its unfinished business,'' Bush declared. And by that, it was clear
he meant his own languishing agenda.
   However, with congressional midterm elections approaching, it's
not too clear how far Bush will get with his renewed appeal to
bipartisanship.
   In a likely sneak preview of his Jan. 31 State of Union address,
Bush served notice on Congress that he will push again for those
items that fell by the wayside last year.
   These include the lower capital gains rate, a revamping of the
Clean Air Act, child care tax credits and anti-crime and education
programs.
   But even the ``demagogue'' remark appeared to be backfiring _
annoying at least one conservative Democrat Bush could use in his
corner, Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.
   Bentsen, whose committee has jurisdiction over the capital gains
issue, had indicated in recent days that he might support a capital
gains reduction as long as it was part of a package of investment
and savings measures.
   But after hearing Bush's ``demagogue'' remarks on television,
Bentsen called a Boston Globe reporter who had interviewed him
earlier in the day to complain that Bush's ``comments tend to make
it a more partisan issue. ... If he chooses to make it a partisan
issue, it will become much more difficult.''
   Although the House approved a reduction in the capital gains
rate that won White House support, the measure was sidetracked in
the Senate by Democratic leaders.
   By nearly any account, Bush had a successful year on the
international front and aides insist that can only help him push
his programs in the Democratic-controlled Congress that reconvenes
Jan. 23.
   But that doesn't automatically mean the popularity will rub off.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that George Bush is coming
into this session of Congress as a strengthened president. Public
approval tempers the way Congress reacts to a president, and
therefore he starts off with a stronger hand,'' said Thomas
Griscom, who was White House communications director in the Reagan
administration.
   Griscom, who teaches political science at the University of
Tennessee, said although Congress can rally behind a president on
foreign policy issues, domestic policy is much more like guerrilla
warfare in which Congress more aggressively asserts its own agenda.
   Although he was one of the most popular of presidents, Reagan
himself fared poorly in winning congressional approval of his
domestic proposals.
   After initial successes early in 1981 in curtailing the growth
of social programs and winning approval of a sweeping tax cut,
Reagan had few other domestic legislative victories in the
succeeding seven years.
   In fact, Reagan budgets became a joking matter on Capitol Hill
as one after the other were proclaimed ``dead on arrival.''
   Even while the Senate was in Republican hands _ from 1985 to
1987 _ Reagan's White House spent much of the time bickering with
Senate Republicans on budget issues.
   Former President Jimmy Carter spent his four years battling with
a Congress controlled by his own party. Few of his programs won
enactment, and his major domestic initiative, a rash of energy
conservation proposals, were heavily modified and watered down.
   ``Now, praise for him is across the spectrum,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
``But the more interesting question is, how much of a residue will
remain when it really matters.
   ``My guess is that by the fall of 1990 many, many other things
will have happened'' to cut into Bush's leverage, Ornstein said.
   Ornstein also disputed that Bush's high ratings would help other
GOP candidates.
   ``The popularity of a president has very little effect in terms
of off-year elections,'' he said.

<HEAD>State Department Encourages Bucharest On Trade Privileges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says the new Romanian
government may have earned the right to lower tariffs for exports
to the United States by relaxing emigration restrictions and moving
toward a multiparty system.
   In a statement Tuesday night, the department said it applauded
the steps taken by the National Salvation Front government and
would consult with Congress about making it easier for Romania to
sell its products in this country.
   Romania had been rewarded for years with what is called
``most-favored nation'' status for permitting tens of thousands of
Jews to emigrate to Israel and for showing a streak of independence
in foreign policy from the Soviet Union.
   Unlike most other Communist governments, Romania was exempted
from the strictures of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which
raises tariffs to countries that keep their citizens from leaving.
   In February 1988, however, the country's ruler, Nicolae
Ceausescu, renounced the conditions. He was executed last month in
a political upheaval. This week the new government in Bucharest
abrogated the fallen leader's decree.
   ``We applaud the announcement,'' the State Department said, ``as
well as the government's recent decree relaxing travel restrictions
and expediting passport issuance procedures. These steps constitute
further evidence that the National Salvation Front is moving
forward in extending human rights to all Romanian citizens.''
   The statement said restoring trade privileges to Romania
requires a waiver from President Bush. ``The Romanian government's
steps towards freedom of travel and emigration, as well as movement
toward a pluralistic multi-party democracy, will be relevant to our
consideration of a waiver,'' it said.

<HEAD>U.S. May Withdraw Up to 5,000 Troops From South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is considering
withdrawing up to 5,000 troops from South Korea, the U.S. Embassy
said today.
   The decision on such a reduction will be made after Secretary of
Defense Richard Cheney meets with his Korean counterpart, said a
statement issued by the embassy. Cheney is expected to visit Seoul
Feb. 14.
   An assessment of the South's ability to defend itself against
the Communist North is under way and will be considered in the
decision, U.S. officials said.
   Also today, President Roh Tae-woo said he wants to meet with
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to discuss free travel across the
Korean peninsula.
   Discussions of American troop withdrawals are sensitive in Korea
and many people in the country have been alarmed by reports that
the U.S. government may bow to congressional pressure for spending
cuts and reduce the 43,000 troops stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense pact.
   Today's statement was issued after Korean media quoted U.S.
Ambassador Donald Gregg as telling journalists in the city of
Kwangju on Tuesday that a reduction of 4,000 to 5,000 troops was
expected.
   ``The report is inaccurate,'' said the statement. ``The thrust
of Ambassador Gregg's remarks was that...the U.S. troops will
remain in Korea as long as the people and governments of both
countries wish them to remain.''
   When pressed for an answer on how many troops might be
withdrawn, ``the ambassador noted that the U.S. troop level at the
beginning of the Reagan administration was about four or five
thousand less than now, and that a return to this level'' was an
option under consideration, the statement said.
   Radicals and dissidents, a small but vocal minority, have staged
violent demonstrations demanding withdrawals, claiming the presense
of U.S. troop hinders dialogue for unification with Communist North
Korea.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. The North invaded the South to start
the 1950-53 Korean War and the two sides remain bitter enemies.
   Despite repeated North-South talks, there has been little
progress at easing hostilities, and both Seoul and Washington have
said U.S. troops will remain until there is a reduction of the
threat from North Korea.
   Regarding Roh's call today for freer travel on the peninsula,
the president said a North-South summit ``should be held as quickly
as possible'' and he urged Communist North Korea to respond
positively.
   Speaking at a nationally televised news conference, Roh said he
would seek an inter-Korean travel and communication agreement as
soon as possible.
   ``If it takes time for the two parts of Korea to agree to free
travel and full opening, then exchanges of correspondence and
telephone calls and free home visits by dispersed relatives should
be implemented first,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, North Korea said it wanted to send two envoys to
South Korean leaders bearing letters concerning the North's latest
reunification proposals.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Refuses to Expand Rule on Illegally Obtained
Evidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, today
refused to create a new exception to the rule barring unlawfully
obtained evidence from criminal trials.
   The court ruled in an Illinois case that statements a criminal
defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used by
prosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial testimony.
   The so-called exclusionary rule, created by the court 75 years
ago, generally prohibits the use at trial of any illegally obtained
evidence. But the court later carved out an exception by allowing
prosecutors to use such evidence to contradict a defendant's own
trial testimony.
   Today, the justices refused to expand that exception to let
prosecutors use such evidence to rebut or discredit other
witnesses' testimony.
   The Illinois Supreme Court was wrong to allow such an expansion,
Justice William J. Brennan wrote.
   ``Finding this extension inconsistent with the balance of values
underlying our previous applications of the exclusionary rule, we
reverse,'' Brennan said.
   He was joined by three liberal allies, Justices Thurgood
Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Harry A. Blackmun, and by Justice
Byron R. White, usually one of the court's most conservative
members on ``law-and-order'' issues.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented.
   Writing for the dissenters, Kennedy said, ``Where the jury is
misled by false testimony, otherwise subject to flat contradiction
by evidence illegally seized, the protection of the exclusionary
rule is perverted into a license to use perjury ... free from the
risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances.''
   The Illinois court had voted to allow the introduction of
illegally obtained evidence in the trial of Darryl James, sentenced
to 30 years in prison for a 1982 murder.
   James was 15 when arrested in his mother's beauty parlor for a
pair of Aug. 30, 1982 shootings. He was tried as an adult.
   Prosecutors said James shot and killed Geliria Boyd and wounded
another youth in a late-night confrontation on a south Chicago
street.
   Five prosecution witnesses identified James as the triggerman,
and testified that on the night of the crime he had long,
reddish-brown hair.
   At his trial, James had short, black hair.
   James did not testify but two defense witnesses testified in his
behalf. One said that James had short, black hair the night of the
shootings.
   Prosecutors then won the judge's permission to let a police
detective testify that James, when arrested, said he had long,
reddish-brown hair the night of the crime and that he had his hair
dyed and cut at his mother's shop.
   The judge initially had disallowed such testimony, ruling that
James' arrest was unlawful because police at the time did not have
a court warrant or probable cause to suspect him of committing a
crime.
   Today's decision means James is entitled to a new trial, at
which the statement obtained during his unlawful arrest will not be
allowed as evidence.
   But the five eyewitness identifications could be used at the new
trial.
   In a separate criminal law decision involving evidence, the
court ruled by a 6-3 vote that federal juries may be told about a
defendant's alleged prior criminal conduct even if a previous trial
on those charges ended in an acquittal.
   White wrote the court's majority opinion in that case, and
Brennan, Marshall and Stevens dissented.
   The ruling upheld the bank robbery conviction and 70-year prison
sentence of Reuben Dowling, convicted of robbing $7,000 from the
First Pennsylvania Bank in Frederiksted, St. Croix, in the Virgin
Islands on July 8, 1985.
   Federal appeals courts had been divided over whether such
evidence could be used.
   The cases are James vs. Illinois, 88-6075, and Dowling vs. U.S.,
88-6025.

   Columbia's astronauts smoothly put a
Navy communications satellite into orbit today and sped on to a
rendezvous with a science laboratory they want to pluck from space
before it falls to Earth.
   ``We had a good deploy. ... It looked real great,'' reported
mission specialist David Low as the 15,200-pound Syncom satellite
slipped out of its berth and spun away like a Frisbee, leaving the
cargo bay empty and ready to receive the science package on Friday.
   ``We copy. Congratulations,'' Mission Control replied.
   Forty-five minutes after release, an onboard motor fired to
propel the satellite toward its permanent working post 22,300 miles
above the Pacific.
   The $85 million Syncom, built by Hughes Aircraft, will complete
a network of five satellites through which the Pentagon
communicates with its planes, ships and bases around the world.
   ``It's going to be a busy day,'' Mission Control told the
astronauts as it wakened them early today with a rousing rendition
of Bing Crosby's ``What's More American ...?''
   Columbia commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee
steered the spaceship through a series of maneuvers in their
continuing pursuit of the Long Duration Exposure Facility, a
21,400-pound satellite orbiting 202 miles up.
   When they soared into space Tuesday, they trailed their quarry
by 1,725 miles. When they released Syncom, they were about 900
miles behind.
   Flight director Al Pennington said Columbia, the oldest shuttle,
``continues to fly beautifully. The lady of the fleet is really
working fine for us right now.''
   Traveling in a slightly lower orbit at about 17,400 mph,
Columbia takes about a minute less to circle the globe, enabling
the shuttle to catch up gradually.
   Atmospheric drag has been pulling the errant satellite to Earth
about half a mile a day, and that rate is increasing. If the
astronauts do not bring it back, the satellite is expected to make
a fiery death dive through the atmosphere about March 9 that would
destroy all of its scientific experiments.
   On Friday, mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar will reach out with
Columbia's 50-foot robot arm and snag the satellite, which will be
tucked into the cargo bay for the trip home.
   Scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how
various materials and systems withstood the long stay in orbit _
information that will help in designing a permanent space station
and the ``Star Wars'' defense system.
   ``LDEF is a virtual treasure trove of science and technology
information,'' said William Kinard, chief scientist for the project.
   Scientists may reap a big bonus because the satellite has been
in space five years longer than intended. It was to have been
retrieved 10 months after a shuttle put it into orbit in 1984. But
scheduling problems and the 1986 Challenger disaster delayed the
retrieval.
   As they chased the satellite, mission specialists Marsha Ivins,
Low and Dunbar plunged into a busy day of experiments,
concentrating on materials processing and tests of how well the
human body adapts to living in weightless space.
   Columbia's 10-day mission, the second-longest in 33 shuttle
missions, is a stepping stone to even longer flights leading to
extended stays in space of several months aboard space station
Freedom later in this decade.
   Columbia will be modified for 16-day flights starting in 1993. A
new orbiter being built, Endeavour, will be capable of 28-day trips.

   Lithuanian demonstrators chanting
``Freedom!'' rallied to demand independence today, one day before
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visits the republic to try to
halt its defiance of Moscow.
   Banners displayed among 20,000 protesters in central Cathedral
Square ranged from one polite welcome to more blunt calls for
Gorbachev to go home and take the Soviet army with him.
   ``We didn't join the Soviet Union, you grabbed us!'' read one
banner, referring to the Soviet Union's annexation of the Baltic
republic in 1940.
   Gorbachev is expected Thursday for three days of meetings with
factory workers, collective farmers, members of ethnic minorities
and Communist Party activists to try to reverse the Lithuanian
Communist Party's decision Dec. 20 to split from the national party
and support independence for the republic.
   It was the first such break since the Communists took power in
Moscow in 1917. The Soviet leader has consistently and sharply
criticized Lithuanian Communist leaders for the move for
independence.
   Leaders of Sajudis, a grass-roots Lithuanian political movement,
hope to draw 1 million of Lithuania's 3.7 million people to Vilnius
on Thursday to show Gorbachev the extent of support for
independence.
   A spokesman for Sajudis, Rimantas Kanapienis, said the
organization rejected a call by Kremlin ideology chief Vadim A.
Medvedev, sent to Lithuania in advance of Gorbachev's visit, to
call off the rally today.
   Medvedev indicated Tuesday that the Moscow leadership favors
granting Lithuanians more autonomy as part of the union but remains
opposed to Lithuanian secession.
   Demonstrators, waving the red, yellow and green flag of
independent Lithuania, made it clear today they felt it is too late
for Gorbachev to change the course for independence.
   ``Lithuania has already decided,'' said one sign.
   Lithuania was recognized as an independent country by Soviet
founder Vladmir Lenin, but Josef Stalin annexed it in 1940 as part
of a secret Nazi-Soviet treaty.
   One sign read: ``Lenin recognized Lithuania. Stalin took away
its independence, and Gorbachev?''
   Gorbachev last visited one of the Baltic republics in February
1987, when he traveled to Riga, Latvia. Lithuanian activists say he
hasn't been to their republic in a decade.
   Activists in Lithuania, which was absorbed by the Soviet Union
along with the other Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia, have
been approaching the call for independence for 18 months. Some say
independence is still several years away even in their most
favorable scenarios.
   The stakes for the Gorbachev's visit are high, because the
Lithuanian party split could encourage others across this vast
country to follow suit, breaking up the Soviet empire.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev warned Monday of a
``domino effect.''

   Aurora's schools have crossed tuna off the
lunch menu at the behest of a dozen students who object to
fishermen using nets that drown dolphins.
   ``It was so exciting, we were jumping up and down,'' Karen Babb,
a 16-year-old Gateway High School student, said of the ban.
   The 26,000-student district is following the lead of schools in
Milford, Conn., where a tuna boycott was begun as part of a
nationwide effort to pressure fishermen into using fishing lines
instead of nets, which capture dolphins.
   Associate District Superintendent Dave Zeckser, who approved the
ban, said the 43 schools use 40 cases of tuna a year, mostly for
faculty members.
   ``Kids don't like tuna, kids don't eat tuna,'' he said Tuesday.
``We wanted to be supportive of the ecological issue, but secondly,
and more importantly, here was a group of kids who were trying to
be constructive with their protest, and we wanted to reward them.''

<HEAD>Preparatory Meeting For Drug Summit Begins in Bolivia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government delegations from Bolivia,
Colombia and Peru met today under heavy police protection to
prepare for the drug summit that will be attended by their leaders
and President Bush.
   The U.S. delegation, led by a State Department deputy assistant
secretary, Michael Skol, was scheduled to arrive Thursday to help
plan the Feb. 15 summit in Cartagena, Colombia.
   The summit, planned by President Bush and the leaders of
Bolivia, Columbia and Peru, has been clouded by negative reaction
to the U.S. invasion of Panama and a U.S. plan to place warships
off Colombia's coast to intercept drugs.
   Police today guarded the posh hotel in Santa Cruz where the
delegation met. The tropical city, a cocaine trafficking center, is
355 miles east of La Paz, the Bolivian capital.
   The session will work out an agenda and preliminary agreements
that will be announced at the summit, which Bush and Presidents
Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia will
attend.
   Peru's president, Alan Garcia, said he will attend only if the
U.S. troops that invaded Panama Dec. 20 withdraw first. He was
sharply critical of the U.S. action and has said he cannot meet
with the leader of an ``invading power.''
   Peru may send a high-ranking official in Garcia's place.
   The Colombian and Bolivian governments also criticized the
United States for invading Panama, saying it violated the principle
of non-intervention. But they said they will go ahead with plans to
participate in the summit.
   Colombian representatives in Santa Cruz were expected, however,
to bring up the dispute over U.S. plans to establish a naval sea
and air presence off its coast to intercept drug smugglers.
   In Bogota, a spokesman for Barco today said he had no comment on
the plan, and U.S. officials said it will not be carried out
immediately.
   Peru and Bolivia, impoverished nations that supply nearly all of
the coca leaf used to make cocaine, have said they will stress the
need to see the drug problem as a social, rather than criminal,
problem. They are pressing for aid from wealthy countries, to
develop alternative crops and reduce the poverty that makes
trafficking an attractive proposition.
   Bolivia's information minister, Manfredo Kempf, said his
nation's delegation would stress ``the importance of alternative
development, without ignoring policies and programs related to
interdiction and prevention.''
   Security at the Cartegena meeting is a major concern for the
United States, which sees Bush as a prime target for Colombia's
powerful cocaine cartels.

   Charles Stuart may have been looking to open a
restaurant and stood to collect about $660,000 in life insurance on
his wife when she was killed in a shooting he blamed on a mugger, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Boston Globe, citing unidentified sources, said that Stuart
stood to gain from three policies on Carol Stuart.
   The Globe reported that Stuart also had reading material in his
home indicating he was studying how to start a business and that
his friends told investigators they had planned to go into the
restaurant business with Stuart.
   Investigators have refused to say publicly whether they believed
that Stuart, who jumped to his death off a bridge Thursday after
his brother implicated him in the slaying of his wife, had an
insurance-related motive.
   Authorities did confirm that a .38-caliber revolver pulled from
a river in suburban Revere on Tuesday appears to be one missing
from the fur store Stuart managed and is believed to have been used
to kill his pregnant wife and wound him.
   The Globe, in a column today, quoted a law enforcement source it
did not further identify as charging that Stuart killed his wife
for the insurance money to open a restaurant.
   One element of the newspaper's report came into question today:
The Globe said a $480,000 insurance check to Stuart had been
processed by Prudential Insurance Co. on Thursday. But a Prudential
spokesman said this morning that his company had no record of
insurance being taken out on Stuart's wife.
   The spokesman talked to The Associated Press on the condition he
not be identified. He said the company did not usually disclose
whom it insured but wanted to correct an erroneous newspaper report.
   A grand jury on Friday will begin an investigation, said
District Attorney Newman Flanagan.
   Stuart, 30, told police he and his wife were shot by a black man
who forced his way into their car as they left a childbirth class
Oct. 23. A black man was named as a suspect in the case but was
later cleared.
   Mrs. Stuart died hours after the shooting. Their son,
Christopher, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section, died 17
days later.
   The Globe also said transcripts of telephone conversations on
Jan. 2 between two of Stuart's siblings show that his siblings
planned to tell their parents of suspicions that he was involved in
the killing.
   The transcript was from a call on a line at Revere Fire
Department, where his brother Michael is a firefighter, the Globe
said.
   ``We're going to tell Mom and Dad,'' Stuart's sister, Shelley
Yandoli, told Michael.
   ``What are you going to tell them?'' Michael responded.
   ``We're going to tell them we know that Chuck was involved.
We're not going to say that he killed her,'' she reportedly
answered. The Globe did not say whether she told her parents.
   Divers recovered the snub-nose revolver from the Pines River in
Revere on Tuesday, said Larry Gillis, a spokesman for the
Metropolitan District Commission police.
   The gun's registration numbers matched those on a pistol
reported stolen from the fur shop where Charles Stuart worked, the
Globe said, citing unidentified sources.
   ``It fits the description,'' said Gillis. ``Hopefully a major
piece of the puzzle has fallen into place.''
   Flanagan said the gun would be sent to the FBI crime laboratory
in Washington for tests. The gun was beginning to rust, police said.
   Jack DeCourcy, FBI agent in Boston, said it was possible to
detect fingerprints on a gun found in salt water, depending on how
long it was submerged, how rusty it was, and whether it was found
in silt. Pines River is brackish.
   Flanagan said divers also planned to search for other evidence,
though he declined to be more specific.
   Stuart's brother Matthew told authorities last week that he met
Charles Stuart at a car on the night of the shooting. Matthew also
told authorities Charles had passed him Mrs. Stuart's handbag,
which contained some personal items and a .38-caliber handgun.
   Matthew told his attorney that he was not then aware that his
brother or Mrs. Stuart had been shot. He said he took the bag to
Revere and threw it and the gun separately into the Pines River.
   Police recovered the handbag the day Stuart committed suicide.
   The killing attracted national attention in part because of
Stuart's dramatic telephone call on his car phone to police after
he and his wife were shot. After Stuart identified a black as the
suspect, it increased racial tensions.
   On Tuesday night, several hundred people gathered at a church in
Mission Hill, the neighborhood where the Stuarts were shot, for a
service aimed at easing racial tensions.
   ``Moving on. That's what the city of Boston is doing here
tonight,'' Mayor Raymond Flynn, who helped organize the ecumenical
service, told the racially mixed crowd at Mission Church.

<HEAD>Miners Win Disputed Land After Being Told to Leave Reservation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has given tens of
thousands of gold prospectors access to more than a million acres
of disputed forest land after ordering them off adjacent Indian
property.
   Justice Ministry spokesman Vinicius Becker said today there is
no guarantee the miners will not return to the Yanomami Indian
reservation, which they have been illegally mining for the past two
years.
   Under an agreement announced Tuesday night, the government said
it would stop removing miners from the reservation in return for
them giving their guns to police and voluntarily leaving the
reservation in Brazil's northwest corner.
   They will be moved to three adjacent areas totaling 1.6 million
acres, which originally belonged to the tribe and is still claimed
by Yanomamis, one of the world's largest primitive Indian tribes.
   ``This is the peaceful solution to the problem. There will be no
shock or confrontation,'' Becker said by telephone from Brasilia,
the capital.
   ``The only thing that keeps them out (of the reservation) is the
constitution. We expect the miners to keep the agreement. If there
are violations, the government will act,'' he said.
   The agreement ended a tense campaign to force the miners off
Indian's land, which once covered 23 million acres but has been
reduced by the government to about 5 million acres.
   On Monday, federal police with machine guns occupied the airport
in Boa Vista, Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state and the main
supply point for the miners, and closed clandestine dirt air strips
in the area.
   Miners protested in the streets of Boa Vista, and small planes
buzzed the airport in support of the miners. Many prospectors
reportedly were prepared to resist police efforts to dislodge them
from the jungle.
   About 9,000 Yanomamis live on land rich in gold, tin and
diamonds in Roraima state. About 70 percent of the tribe's original
land has been made into national forests and parks. Today, the
reservation has been reduced to 19 separate areas totaling about 5
million acres.
   Under the agreement, the prospectors promised to use filters to
reduce water pollution from mercury, used in gold panning. Federal
police were to register all air landing strips in the new mining
areas to control prospecting.
   Becker said the agreement will be signed this week.
   Brazil has 220,000 native Indians, most of whom live in the
Amazon jungle.

<TEXT>
   A seventh arrest has been made in a sexual
abuse case in which at least 70 children were believed molested by
day-care workers.
   The latest arrest came Tuesday, nearly a year after an
investigation of the Little Rascals Day Care Center began. A sixth
person was arrested Monday.
   Robin Boles Byrum, 19, of Edenton, was jailed on $500,000 bail
on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor and
conspiracy.
   In the months since the first allegations were made, wave after
wave of indictments have been handed up. Court documents say
day-care workers in 1988 and 1989 had sex in front of children and
had sex with youngsters.
   The initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children who
were allegedly molested, but prosecutors said in court papers filed
in November that more than 70 children, ages 2 through 7, were
abused in some way.
   The day-care center in this town of 5,800 on the Albemarle Sound
lost its license in June and was closed. The first arrest was in
April.
   On Monday, Darlene Harris, 25, was jailed on $75,000 bail on
charges including conspiracy and taking indecent liberties with a
minor. District Attorney H.P. Williams said she had taken
photographs of adults participating in sexual acts with children at
the center.
   Robert F. Kelly Jr., 41, who owned the center with his wife,
Elizabeth T. Kelly, is jailed on $1.5 million bail, his wife on $1
million.
   The investigation was triggered by a complaint to social
services authorities department by an person not identified by
investigators.
   Little Rascals had been considered one of the best day-care
centers in the area. Its enrollment changed daily, with 25 to 40
children cared for each day.

<TEXT>
   Police blocked highways today, and an official
said 15,000 people were detained following the assassination of a
former defense minister, the most prominent victim of the nation's
10-year-old guerrilla war.
   Enrique Lopez Albujar was killed Tuesday when three Shining Path
rebels armed with machine guns killed him near a shopping center in
a Lima suburb, police said. He died at a military hospital with at
least 10 bullet wounds.
   Witnesses said the four gunmen fled in an automobile.
   Police units aided by six helicopters searched through Lima and
its outskirts Tuesday night and early today, stopping about 8,000
cars in a search for suspects, police said. Most of the 15,000
detained were taken in for not carrying documents and are expected
to be released in the next few days, an Interior Ministry spokesman
said on condition of anonymity.
   Lopez was the first person who had served on the Cabinet to be
killed in guerrilla violence that has claimed the lives of hundreds
of federal and local officials _ more than 130 in 1989 alone.
   The main guerrilla faction is the Shining Path, a fanatical
Maoist-inspired group that has been fighting to topple Peru's
elected governments since 1980.
   Witnesses interviewed by The Associated Press said Lopez had an
office in the shopping center and usually arrived at the same time
every day, often accompanied by a bodyguard.
   Speaking to reporters at the government palace, President Alan
Garcia said Lopez was entitled to a military guard and that he
didn't understand why Lopez was alone when he was attacked.
   ``It pains me and I regret that he was alone in spite of the
situation of war we are living in,'' Garcia said.
   Lopez was named the country's first defense minister by Garcia,
taking office in 1987 when the ministry was formed. Previously, the
army, navy and air force had their own ministries.
   He served until May, when he was replaced by army Gen. Julio
Velasquez.
   Shining Path began its insurgency in Ayacucho, in the Andes
mountains 235 from the capital. In the past year, it has stepped up
assaults in Lima.
   Last fall, it tried to disrupt municipal elections by killing
local officials across Peru. But Peruvians defied death threats and
turned out in large numbers to vote on Nov. 12.
   Peruvians expect the Shining Path to step up attacks as
presidential elections slated for April draw closer.
   The Shining Path operates throughout the highlands, including in
the Huallaga Valley, part of the coca-producing jungle in the
northeast and the single largest source of coca-leaf in the world.
   Authorities say the rebels operate in league with
drug-traffickers in the valley, protecting them from police in
exchange for a share of drug profits.
   The government says more than 17,500 people, including
government forces, civilians, guerrillas and American reporter Todd
Smith of The Tampa Tribune have been killed in the insurgency.
   Authorities routinely accuse the Shining Path of massacring
peasants, but in November Amnesty International accused government
forces of becoming equally savage in their effort to crush the
insurgency.
   The London-based human rights group said both sides were guilty
of torture, mutilation and murder.

   Iran hanged 31 people Wednesday after
they were found guilty of smuggling drugs, the Islamic Republic
News Agency said.
   Ten of those hanged were members of an international drug
smuggling ring, the news agency said in a dispatch monitored in
Cyprus.
   They were among 23 people executed at dawn at a prison in Karaj
west of Tehran, including three women and four Afghans. Eight
others were hanged in the cities of Shiraz, Sabzevar and Saveh, the
agency said.
   A draconian, 1-year-old anti-narcotics law stipulates the death
penalty for anyone found with even small amounts of heroin or opium.
   Wednesday's toll was not a record for Iran. Authorities have
executed as many as 80 people in a single day.
   Human rights organizations have condemned the executions.
Opponents of the regime say many of those killed are not drug
smugglers but political prisoners.
   The Financial Times of London reported Tuesday that for the
first time in memory, three people were beheaded, rather than
hanged, in the western city of Hamadan for drunkenness and sexual
offenses. It said they were whipped before being executed.

   The Elections Commission office Wednesday
dismissed an objection to the candidacy of opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi in the May 27 general election.
   More than 1,000 people had gathered at the commission office to
await the decision, and some cheered when it was announced, a
Western diplomat said.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, a leader of the National League for Democracy, has
been under house arrest since July. She has filed to run in a
Rangoon constituency for what would be the first multiparty poll in
more than a quarter-century.
   Labang Grong, a candidate of the National Unity Party, had
alleged Ms. Suu Kyi was not eligible to run because she was
entitled to the rights of a foreign citizen and had links with a
rebel student group. She is married to a Briton but holds a Burmese
passport.
   Labang Grong said he would appeal the decision.
   The military government has arrested thousands of dissidents and
harassed opposition politicians since seizing power in a bloody
coup in September 1988. Western diplomats doubt its pledge to hold
a free election.

   Lt. Gen. Basilio Olara Okello, a Ugandan
rebel leader who had been living in exile in Khartoum for four
years, has died from diabetes complicated by malaria. He was 61.
   His family did not say when he died.
   Okello participated in the five-year civil war in Uganda that
was ended by President Yoweri Museveni in 1986.
   After Okello fled to Sudan, Museveni accused him of human rights
abuses in the Luwero triangle area near the Ugandan capital of
Kampala, where thousands of civilians were reported to have been
massacred in the early 1980s. Some Ugandan rebels said as many as
300,000 had been massacred during the civil war.
   Okello was the general commander of the Ugandan People's
Democratic Army, the military wing of the Ugandan People's
Democratic Movement, which has been fighting Museveni since he took
over power.
   Okello's family said he would be buried in Khartoum, at a time
to be determined. They said they feared that Kampala authorities
would treat him as a criminal and not give him a proper burial.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle today called China's
lifting of martial law ``a positive step forward for human rights''
and a vindication of President Bush's efforts to reopen diplomatic
ties with Beijing.
   A White House spokesman said there was no change in the U.S.
economic sanctions against China, but hinted that the United States
stands ready to back World Bank loans for China for humanitarian
needs.
   Quayle applauded the Chinese government's action in a brief
exchange with reporters at the outset of a meeting with the
visiting Japanese minister of trade and industry, Hikaru Matsunaga.
   But he deferred to the State Department questions about whether
the move might prompt a change in U.S. sanctions against China
imposed last June after the Chinese government sent in tanks to
Tiananmen Square to crush pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Quayle said, ``We view China's decision to lift martial law as a
step forward. I believe that you begin to see dividends from the
president's policy toward China.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported today, however, that the
administration has decided to oppose the resumption of a $700
million loan program to China until the leadership in Beijing
changes its hardline anti-democracy and economic policies.
   At a White House briefing, deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk
said there was no change in the U.S. sanctions. But he said from
the start, Bush has wanted to avoid actions that hurt the Chinese
people.
   ``The United States, therefore, will take a close look at loans
that meet basic human needs and will consider them on a
case-by-case basis,'' said Popadiuk.
   The White House was informed by the Chinese embassy late Tuesday
about the lifting of martial law. ``We would like to think that
General (Brent) Scowcroft's trip played a part in this,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``Obviously we must assess the full scope of this action after
observing its implementation,'' said Popadiuk. ``This is another in
a series of positive steps that we have witness over the past few
weeks. We will continue to monitor developments in China.''
   To critics who argue that lifting martial law does not mean an
easing of China's oppressive human rights policy, Quayle replied:
``It is a positive step forward for human rights.''
   But on Capitol Hill, Rep. William S. Broomfield of Michigan, the
ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the
lifting of martial law was ``more blue smoke and mirrors, and would
not fool anybody in Congress into believing that the Chinese
leadership was moderating its oppressive rule.''
   He said the Chinese action was intended to silence critics
worldwide, especially members of Congress who have attacked China's
crackdown on pro-democracy movements.
   Bush has sent his national security adviser, Scowcroft, and
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger on two missions to
China since the June massacre to lay the groundwork for normalizing
relations again. The first Scowcroft mission was conducted in
secrecy, coming to light only after his trip last month following
Bush's Malta summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush has rejected criticism of his handling of U.S.-Chinese
relations and said it serves no good to try to ``excommunicate''
the communist regime and its 1 billion people from the rest of the
world.
   Scowcroft sought an easing of China's hard-line policies in
exchange for normalization of relations.
   The United States continues to provide a refuge in its embassy
in Beijing for Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist and prominent
dissident, and his wife.
   Premier Li Peng lifted martial law today, but strict laws
banning dissent remain in force.

   A bomb exploded in the Angolan capital
of Luanda, injuring three people and damaging the government's
criminal records office, the Angolan state news agency reported
Wednesday.
   A pregnant woman and two children aged 3 and 7 were seriously
injured in the blast Tuesday night, the report said.
   Damage to the records office and other buildings was slight, the
agency said.
   There were no immediate reports of any claims of responsibility
for the blast.
   Several foreign companies operating in Luanda had received bomb
threats in recent weeks, the news agency said.
   U.S.-backed UNITA rebels have claimed responsibility for
previous bombings in the capital. UNITA _ the National Union for
the Total Indpendence of Angola _ has been fighting to force
Angola's Marxist government to share power since the country gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.

   The City Council has decided to make a

   Walter Rhodes, who has lived under the Truckee River bridge for
four months, on Tuesday was appointed to a citizens' committee
formed to spruce up the riverbanks after he showed up at a council
meeting to protest.
   Rhodes charged that the committee was really formed in an
attempt to roust the homeless who sleep by the river.
   ``I'm worried this is another excuse to harass the homeless
people, of which I am,'' he said.
   Mayor Pete Sferrazza recommended Rhodes, 54, join the committee
of civic and government leaders.
   Many of the homeless would rather sleep by the river than in
shelters, which are understaffed and sometimes unruly, Rhodes said.
He added that until other shelters are available, river transients
should be left alone.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson has signed a law
curbing smoking in public places but said the Legislature should
make it tougher.
   The law, which takes effect July 1, was called an important
first step by the governor on Tuesday.
   The law makes it an offense punishable by a fine of up to $500
to smoke anywhere other than in a designated area in most public
buildings. Restaurants, stores, theaters and other public places
may designate smoking areas.
   Bowling alleys, bars, factories, warehouses, foundries and
industrial complexes not generally open to the public would be
exempt.
   Sen. Bob Kustra called the law is ``a victory for tobacco
companies'' because municipalities that now lack a no-smoking
ordinance cannot have restrictions tougher than state law.
   By comparison, a smoking law that went into effect this month in
New York State bans smoking in auditoriums, elevators, gymnasiums,
food stores and shared taxis and restricts it to certain areas in
larger restaurants and other public places. New York's law is
touted as the nation's toughest after Minnesota's.
   During debate on the Illinois measure, which passed the House
101-3 and the Senate 50-0, opponents said the bill was so weak that
even national groups such as the American Cancer Society and the
American Lung Association opposed it.

<HEAD>White House: No Plans to Invade Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, while critical of
progress toward the Feb. 25 elections in Nicaragua, has no plans to
use Panama as a precedent and invade the Central American nation,
the White House said today.
   The administration has justified the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama
in part by pointing out that that country's elections last May 7
were widely viewed as fraudulently stolen by now-deposed dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Asked about Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole's comment that
Managua should view the invasion of Panama as an example of what
happens to a country that cheats on elections, White House
spokesman Roman Popadiuk said:
   ``We've called for free and fair elections in Nicaragua. There
is an election process under way. We expect free and fair elections
to take place.''
   He added, ``We've noticed that the Nicaraguans have been
harassing the opposition to a great extent, all of which is
counterproductive to an election process going forward smoothly.
This is something that troubles us, this is something that we and
the rest of the international community will be looking at.''
   However, Popadiuk said, questions about an invasion amounted to
``a wild guess.''
   When reporters pressed him, saying he had not ruled it out, the
spokesman replied: ``There are no plans to invade Nicaragua.''
   Popadiuk said President Bush this morning telephoned Nicaraguan
opposition presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro, who he said is
receiving treatment in a Houston hospital for a knee ailment.
   The purpose of the call was ``to inquire about her health ...
and discuss the state of her election campaign,'' thr spokesman
said.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   Jan. 4
   Red Wing (Minn.) Republican Eagle on oil spills:
   Nine months after the horrible spill from the Exxon Valdez oil
tanker, it's clear the effects on Mother Nature will be long
lasting. It's also apparent that _ no matter how well-prepared oil
companies think they may be _ their ability to deal with massive
spills remains miserably inadequate.
   Memories of the spill were rekindled ... by the explosion and
subsequent spill aboard the Iranian tanker Khark 5. Though it's not
nearly as disastrous to the environment as the spill of 11 million
gallons of crude oil in the Prince William Sound of Alaska, crews
are struggling off the coast of Morocco in an attempt to control a
100-square-mile spill of goo.
   As expected, the economic and environmental effects (of a spill)
are enormous. Alaskan fishery authorities have continued to shut
down commercial fisheries in Prince William Sound after renewed
sightings of oil slicks. They fear contamination of catches and
fishing gear.
   Indeed, the spill of the Exxon Valdez was a rarity. But it
doesn't take many events of such magnitude to take their toll on
the environment.

   The Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Noriega:
   It was one of history's better moments when Manuel Noriega
stepped outside the Vatican embassy in Panama City ... and
surrendered ... to U.S. authorities.
   Not only does Noriega deserve to be held accountable on charges
that he helped funnel huge amounts of illicit drugs into the United
States over the years, he must be deterred from ever again having
an army at his command. In other words, General Noriega must remain
precisely what he is today _ General Nothing.
   He will, of course, be held accountable by virtue of the fair
trial he said he wants, and which the Bush administration promised
he would receive. And if the results of that trial favor U.S.
prosecutors, Noriega will never again muster an army or rule over a
nation because that's practically impossible to do from behind
prison bars, where Noriega could end up spending the rest of his
life.
   So it's high fives and a hearty salute to everybody who played a
role in bringing Noriega to justice, from the Bush administration
on down to every last one of the 26,000 members of the U.S.
military who contributed to the success of Operation Just Cause.
   Deserving of a special salute are the 23 U.S. soldiers who made
the ultimate sacrifice in the Panamanian victory. Hats off also to
the Vatican officials in Panama for rendering what President Bush
called ``their even-handed, statesmanlike assistance.'' ....
   Bush said Noriega's ``apprehension and return to the United
States should send a clear signal that the United States is serious
in its determination that those charged with promoting the
distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice.''
   It certainly does send such a signal. Whether the rest of this
world's drug kingpins take heed, however, is something else
entirely. That is why the United States must keep the heat on,
whenever and wherever it has jurisdiction and cause to do so.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Noriega:
   On the whole we would have preferred it if General Noriega had
found safe haven in one of his allied homelands _ in Cuba say, or
perhaps Nicaragua, ... but the Bush administration was determined
to get their man, and get him they did. ...
   Now that we have him, what do we intend to do with him? There is
no doubt that Manuel Noriega is an odious individual _ politician
gangster, drug kingpin, killer _ and the people of Panama are
delirious with joy that he is out of their jurisdiction. ...
   It is difficult to discern how American laws can be violated by
a Panamanian citizen while resident in Panama. Even by the broad,
post-Nuremberg standards of international law, the case against
General Noriega in American courts is problematical.
   Perhaps the single greatest deficiency of our system of justice
_ delay _ will solve the problem for us. By the time the prisoner
has been read his rights, booked, fingerprinted, indicted,
arraigned ... and appeals, the drug war might be won, the defendant
declared too feeble to stand trial at his age, and the matter
declared moot.

   The Jackson (Mich.) Citizen Patriot on Noriega:
   The surrender of Manuel Noriega to the United States government
is a relief of global proportions. And if President George Bush
seemed untypically restrained in announcing the surrender ... , you
have to believe things were different off-camera. Surely there was
unbridled joy in the White House. ... President Bush has every
right to relish this moment. It not only represents the completion
of all four U.S. military objectives in Panama, it was a personal
victory for the president. ...
   Bush's military invasion had as one of its basic objectives
bringing General Noriega to the United States to stand trial. The
ousted dictator faced lengthy indictments in the federal courts
alleging complicity with illicit drug traffic.
   But the initial failure to capture General Noriega was an
embarrassment. For days, as the military tracked their prey from
one place to another, it seemed as though he was destined to
outsmart the Americans. When he threw himself on the mercy of the
Catholic Church by seeking sanctuary, many believed he had thwarted
his enemies. After all, didn't the church say repeatedly that it
would not hand over General Noriega to the U.S. government?
   In the end, the church didn't hand him over. General Noriega,
stripped of position and power, made the decision to hand himself
over to the U.S. government. Considering his limited options, going
on trial in the United States may have seemed to be the best
alternative. The government has assured General Noriega that he
would receive a fair trial and not in any case face the death
penalty.
   The promise of fairness will be a great test of U.S.
jurisprudence, especially given the intense characterization of
Manuel Noriega as a cold-blooded, dope-peddling dictator. Still, he
will get the best defense that money can buy, and he has nothing to
fear if the evidence does not support the allegations. For, unlike
Panama under his rule, the United States is a nation of law, due
process and justice.
   Welcome to our venue, General Noriega.

   Idahonian, Moscow, Idaho, on Noriega:
   Deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega is behind bars in
Miami, and President Bush has declared the U.S. invasion and
occupation of Panama an unqualified success.
   Not so fast, George. Jailing Noriega may have fulfilled one of
the stated purposes of the largest U.S. military action since the
Vietnam war. But it doesn't make any less tragic the deaths of
dozens of U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Panamanians. Nor does it
excuse the flagrant disregard for international law that has
occurred in the name of bringing Noriega to justice and imposing
our version of democracy on Panama.
   Sure, it's nice to have Noriega out of power. But ousting him
has come at a terribly high price: loss of life, destruction of the
homes of thousands of Panamanians, weakening of principles of
diplomatic immunity, erosion of U.S. prestige in Latin America.

   The Miami Herald on El Salvador:
   It took an international outcry and the concerted pressures of
U.S. lawmakers and Roman Catholic leaders.
   Still, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani's announcement
that members of his country's armed forces formally have been
implicated in the brutal Nov. 16 murder of six prominent Jesuit
priests, their cook, and her 15-year-old daughter is heartening.
   It is a welcome sign that the criminal investigation is
proceeding as promised and appears to be serious. This time.
   That hasn't occurred before in the 10 years that the Salvadoran
civil war has raged. Heinous crimes have never been resolved,
despite _ or perhaps because of _ evidence implicating top military
officials.
   He promises that punishment will be meted out ``down to the last
person implicated.'' Given the moderate and no-nonsense style that
he has demonstrated so far, one is inclined to believe that he
intends just that.

   The Bakersfield (Calif.) Californian on democracy in Eastern
Europe and at home:
   Take a moment to consider what's been happening around the
world, and then look at the United States. The dichotomy slaps you
in the face: People in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world
risk their lives for democracy; here it seems taken for granted.
   Americans could learn a lesson from the Poles, the East Germans,
the Romanians, the Czechoslovakians _ and especially, from the
students in Beijing. History is full of examples of brutal
repression of every little attempt they made for a taste of
freedom. For two generations, we have watched and felt pity. Now,
perhaps, we should envy them.
   Granted, very few true democracies _ in which everyone votes on
everything _ exist in the world, simply because it is too
cumbersome and inefficient. In our representative democracy, we
choose people to do the job of making laws and carrying out the
functions of government. It is ironic that these elected positions
have become less competitive in a society that boasts free market
competition. More than 90 percent of incumbents are returned to
office in the House of Representatives.
   In Eastern Europe, a politician now knows the people will come
out and vote on the substantial issues he represents. In America,
as humorist Dan Bennett put it, an elected official is one who gets
51 percent of the vote cast by 40 percent of the 60 percent of
(prospective) voters who have registered.
   Is it not possible to do something to reinvigorate our
democracy? If the repressed peoples of the world can rise up and
change their system, why can't we insist on our own meaningful
reforms?

   Mail Tribune, Medford, Ore., on Bush-environment:
   President George Bush plans in his fiscal 1991 budget to cut by
85 percent the budgets of four successful energy-conservation
programs. According to government sources quoted by The Associated
Press, Bush will propose spending $30 million on programs that
currently receive $200 million a year.
   Slated for cuts are a $161 million weatherization program that
supplies poor families with insulation, weather stripping and other
energy-saving materials; a $25 million effort to help schools and
hospitals save energy; (and) a $10 million program to help states
publicize and support conservation measures such as van pooling. ...
   The weatherization program has saved an equivalent of 4.5
million barrels of oil a year by insulating 1.8 million American
homes since 1977, according to the Department of Energy. ...
   Bush's actions don't match his words. ... (H)e proclaimed April
22 as the 20th annual Earth Day, saying he was making
``preservation of the planet a personal commitment.'' Yet he plans
to cut funding for programs that are designed to reduce U.S.
reliance on rapidly depleting fossil fuels.

   The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on Thornburgh-organized crime:
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh has completed a
reorganization of U.S. strike forces against organized crime and
many offcials are wondering why he did it.
   Since the government began putting the units together in 1968,
they have made impressive inroads against the mafia and other
criminal conspirators in major American cities. The Brooklyn strike
force alone has since 1980 convicted six leaders of the Colombo and
Bonanno crime families, along with more than 65 other organized
crime figures, more than 50 union officials, eight members of
Congress, more than 200 business figures and several local
officials.
   The strike forces were composed of government prosecutors and
agents of several federal investigative agencies. They reported
directly to the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the
Justice Department in Washington.
   Under Thornburgh's reorganization, the prosecutors assigned to
the strike forces will become assistants to the U.S. attorneys in
their jurisdictions. Thornburgh has said this will lead to
``substantial management benefits'' because there will no longer be
two separate federal prosecutors in the same jurisdiction. ...
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., remarked at a committee hearing: ``This is
the first time I can remember where government officials seem
determined to reform a program that everyone agrees has been a
tremendous success.''
   Well, the deed is done, and now we'll see how well the new
system, which really is the old pre-strike force system, works.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1968 Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia killed at least 72 people and seriously injured 266,
a newspaper reported Wednesday in the first official disclosure of
the casualty toll.
   The newspaper Lidova Demokracie listed the toll as of Sept. 3,
1968 _ 13 days after Warsaw Pact tanks and troops entered the
country _ quoting a report by the Czechoslovak prosecutor general.
   Authorities are weighing whether to charge former Communist
officials considered responsible for ``inviting'' the forces of
five Warsaw Pact countries into Czechoslovakia.
   Hard-liner Vasil Bilak and other former senior officials are
widely held responsible for issuing the invitation, although no
evidence has been published.
   Lidova Demokracie said the prosecutor's office has concluded
``the possible actions which brought about military occupation of
the country fulfilled the factual essence of the criminal act of
high treason.''
   Earlier reports said Bilak would not face charges because of the
20-year statute of limitations. Some lawyers say that since Bilak
was immune from prosecution by virtue of his post as a
parliamentary deputy for 21 years, he could now face trial.
   Lidova Demokracie said the prosecutor's office ``tentatively''
decided against prosecution but might re-examine the issue.

   Vice President Dan Quayle told a meeting of
astronomers today that the nation's space program in the future
will emphasize unmanned science experiments and work toward
establishing astronomical observatories on the moon.
   His speech, to the American Astronomical Society, was
interrupted several times by applause as the vice president
emphasized that unmanned science probes would be a major element of
the Bush administration's space effort.
   ``We are committed to a balanced scientific program,'' Quayle
said in a comment that drew applause. ``The large exploration
programs we are planning will not emphasize human activities at the
expense of scientific excellence.''
   He reaffirmed the administration's plans to establish a
permanent base on the moon and later to mount a manned expedition
to Mars.
   ``At some point we hope to establish lunar astronomical
observatories to build on the foundations'' of earlier unmanned
scientific satellites, he said.
   Quayle said the exploration of Mars ``will begin with an
expanded series of unmanned scientific probes, perhaps including a
return of Mars surface samples.''
   The vice president, head of the National Space Council, spoke on
the opening day of the 175th national meeting of the AAS, a
gathering that includes more than a thousand astronomers.
   Many astronomers who depend on government-financed satellites
and telescopes have long complained that the federal emphasis has
been on manned space exploration and provided fewer funds for robot
craft.
   Following Quayle's remarks, John Bacall, the president-elect of
AAS, applauded the vice president's statement that unmanned science
would not be short-changed in the administration's space program.
   The vice president's comments, said Bacall, indicate ``they
understand the importance of unmanned science.''
   He said Quayle's support for astronomical observatories on the
moon creates a challenge for America's astronauts. ``We as
astronomers have to come to grips with the possibility of there
being facilites on the moon and on Mars and what we can best do
with them,'' he said.
   Bush announced plans July 20, the 20th anniversary of the first
Apollo moon landing, to commit the nation to establishing a
permanent moon base in the next century and then to mount a manned
mission to Mars.
   Bush offered few details in that speech, but said that Quayle
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would work
out ``realistic timetables'' for the ambitious effort.
   Since then, the administration has not announced specific plans
for the financing and timing of the projects.
   The cost of the proposed moon and Mars program was estimated
last summer at between $800 billion and $900 billion.
   The proposal got a cool reception in Congress, even by those who
usually are enthusiastic about the nation's space effort.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., a member of the Senate committee that
oversees space spending, said that because the administration's
space program included ``no money, no timetable and no plan, Bush
offers the country not a challenge to inspire us, but a daydream to
briefly entertain us.''
   The American Astronomical Society meeting, which ends Saturday,
is expected to include hundreds of scientific reports on studies of
the stars, the planets and the formation of the universe.
   A major paper is expected to include the first reports by
project scientists of readings taken by the Cosmic Background
Explorer, a NASA satellite launched in November.
   The satellite is designed to pick up faint radiation left over
from the ``big bang,'' the explosion 15 billion years ago that
scientists say created the universe.
   Other reports will address the discovery of what are believed to
be twin quasars, large stellar objects that emit powerful light and
radio waves; a new theory that suggests the Milky Way Galaxy, which
includes the sun, may be shaped differently than previously
believed; and new findings on rapid movements of some galaxies that
are close, in astronomical terms, to the Milky Way.

<HEAD>Goetz Files $40 Million Lawsuit Against Shooting Victim and Lawyer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz has filed a $40
million libel lawsuit against one of his shooting victims and his
lawyers.
   Acting as his own attorney, Goetz charged in the lawsuit filed
Tuesday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan that lawyers William
Kunstler and Ronald Kuby called him a ``walking time-bomb and a
racist.''
   Also named in the lawsuit were the attorneys' client, Darrell
Cabey, 24, and his mother, Shirley Cabey of the Bronx.
   Cabey was one of four black teen-agers shot by Goetz, who is
white, on a subway in Manhattan when they approached him and asked
for $5.
   Goetz, 42, a self-employed electrical calibrator, said the
youths were trying to rob him. They said they were just panhandling.
   Cabey, left paralyzed from the waist down and brain-damaged when
one of Goetz's bullets severed his spinal cord, filed a $50 million
assault lawsuit against Goetz.
   Goetz contended in court papers that Kunstler and Kuby were
trying to defraud him by stating that Cabey is a ``mental
vegetable'' when his injuries were much less severe.
   Goetz served eight months and two weeks of a one-year sentence
after he was convicted on a weapons charge stemming from the
shooting.
   A message asking for comment was left on an answering machine at
a phone number for Kunstler and Kuby, who share law offices, but
the call was not returned.

<TEXT>
   Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida,
confronted with a shake-up in his cabinet, has postponed a Jan.
16-20 visit to the United States because of ``scheduling
difficulties,'' the White House said today.
   The state visit was postponed ``by mutual agreement,'' said
White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk, and will be
rescheduled at a ``mutually convenient'' date.
   He added that the scheduling difficulties were at the Nigerian
end, not in Washington.
   In Lagos, Lt. Gen. Domkat Bali told a news conference today he
resigned from the military government because of differences with
Babangida.
   Babangida announced Dec. 29 he was taking over as defense
minister and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and had
reassigned Bali to the post of minister for internal affairs.
   Bali said he had wanted to quit earlier but Babangida had
persuaded him to stay on so the ruling junta would appear united.
   Bali boycotted Babangida's swearing-in ceremony Sunday at Dodan
Barracks in Lagos and Babangida named a new minister for internal
affairs the following day.
   Bali gave journalists a copy of a letter to Babangida in which
he told the president: ``I cannot morally, mentally or otherwise
see myself fitting into the present scheme of things to be able to
function effectively.''
   Bali, a general for 11 years, was widely respected as an
outspoken officer with a record free of corruption.

<HEAD>Chirac Unveils Ambitious Plan to Clean Up Champs Elysees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Jacques Chirac unveiled a plan Wednesday to
beautify the Champs Elysees, one of the world's most famous streets
overrun in recent years by hamburger joints, street vendors and
parked cars.
   The long-awaited project, to be completed before the end of
Chirac's mandate in 1995, involves eliminating parking on the
single-lane corridors running parallel to the Champs. Two
underground lots will replace the 390 places lost.
   The plan also calls for planting about 250 trees, installing
specially designed trash cans and phone booths, and replacing the
narrow, broken sidewalks with granite slabs widening the paths to
70 feet.
   Chirac did not give an estimate for the cost of the program.
   Facades of several large buildings will be classified as
historical monuments in the hope of attracting high-class hotels
and a cultural center.
   ``The Champs Elysees ... should once again become the privileged
place for promenades it was meant to be ... once again become the
most beautiful avenue in the world,'' Chirac said.
   The Champs Elysees, celebrated in song and fiction and
stretching from the Rond Point to the Arc de Triomphe, was laid out
in 1667 by Louis XIV's finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert.
   Today's visitors have difficulty making their way down the
avenue, navigating among professional beggars and vendors.
   The plan is the brainchild of Pierre-Yves Ligen, the urban
planner who directed renovations at the Louvre and designed the
modernistic furniture at the Musee d'Orsay.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Wednesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   YONKERS DESEGREGATION
   
   A sharply divided court overturned contempt fines imposed
against four Yonkers, N.Y., city councilmen who defied a federal
judge's order to adopt a housing desegregation plan.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the judge who imposed the fines
exceeded his authority.
   Dissenting justices said today's ruling, which follows a series
of decisions last year that generally narrowed the scope of civil
rights laws, could hamstring judges in dealing with officials who
defy anti-discrimination court orders.
   The cases are Spallone vs. U.S., 88-854; Chema vs. U.S., 88-856,
Longo vs. U.S., 88-870.
   
   EVIDENCE
   
   The court refused, by a 5-4 vote, to create a new exception to
the rule barring unlawfully obtained evidence from criminal trials.
   The court ruled in an Illinois case that statements a criminal
defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used by
prosecutors to contradict a defense witness's trial testimony.
   In a separate criminal law decision involving evidence, the
court ruled by a 6-3 vote that federal juries may be told about a
defendant's alleged prior criminal conduct even if a previous trial
on those charges ended in an acquittal.
   The cases are James vs. Illinois, 88-6075, and Dowling vs. U.S.,
88-6025.
   
   TAXES
   
   The court limited the ability of multinational corporations to
challenge state taxes in federal court.
   The justices ruled unanimously that a law generally barring
federal courts from handling lawsuits that attack a state tax
applies to foreign-based multinational businesses.
   The case is Franchise Tax Board vs. Alcan Aluminum, 88-1400.

<HEAD>State: Cafeteria Wall Was Improperly Designed</HEAD>

   The school cafeteria wall that blew in
during a windstorm Nov. 16, killing nine youngsters, was improperly
designed, state officials concluded today.
   ``The masonry portion of the collapsed wall was structurally
flawed by a design error that left it unsupported by lateral or
vertical bracing,'' the state Disaster Preparedness Commission said
in a letter to Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Nine children were fatally injured in a hail of brick, concrete
and glass when a storm shattered the wall at East Coldenham
Elementary School in Newburgh as the youngsters were having lunch.
Fifteen students were injured.
   The commission recommended that state and local agencies improve
review of construction plans for new school buildings and other
public facilities.
   State and local agencies should also improve emergency alert
systems, the commission, headed by Health Commissioner Dr. David
Axelrod, recommended in its report today.
   Engineers concluded that the masonry cafeteria wall by itself
could withstand no more than 45 mph winds but was given added
support by the series of metal-frame windows in the wall. The
school was built in 1959.
   The 1959 building code, which didn't apply to schools at the
time but reflected engineering practices then current, called for
walls designed to resist 75 mph wind. Such walls can actually
resist 120 mph wind, the commission said.
   The day of the collapse, wind speed was estimated at 90 mph to
100 mph, said Axelrod. There have been conflicting reports on
whether it was a tornado that struck the school. State officials
said they believed it was not a tornado but that the effect was the
same.
   Engineering consultants hired by the state ``believe the wall
did not receive proper engineering attention because it was not a
load bearing wall and therefore not analyzed for strength,'' said
commission said.
   Last month, workers began shoring up walls at four schools north
of New York City after engineers found they were similar to the one
that collapsed.

   LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and
Kim Basinger led Mr. Blackwell's 30th annual list of worst-dressed
celebrities today, while praise went to Geena Davis, Liza Minnelli,
Barbara Bush and Princess Diana.
   The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at
Princess Anne, Emily Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and
gave a shared dishonor to Madonna and Sandra Bernhard.
   Model-actress Grace Jones won ``Fashion Fiasco of the Year'' for
an outfit Blackwell described as ``Darth Vader's S-and-M fantasy in
a bird cage.''
   Miss Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will
be the ``Cher for the 90's'' who is ``more fashion freak than biker
chic ... in leather and chains,'' said Blackwell.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
former brat-packer Miss Moore was ``a spandexed `Nightmare on
Willis Street,''' and Batman's Miss Basinger was a ``parading
peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Blackwell reduced Princess Anne to ``lumpy, dumpy and frumpy,''
Cher to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a sequined slingshot,'' Miss
Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on steroids,'' Miss Abdul to a ``fashion
gypsy (who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and
Madonna-Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy, trampy ...
and cartoon campy.''
   Joining the list of ``Fabulous Fashion Independents'' were Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Barbara Walters, Angela Lansbury, Tina
Brown, Ivana Trump and Jacqueline Onassis.

   Military investigators today went
through the wreckage of an Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter today
for the cause of a crash that killed all four soldiers aboard.
   The $4.6 million helicopter went down during exercises Tuesday
afternoon at this Mojave Desert base, said Capt. Gary Cleland. The
soldiers were from Fort Riley, Kan., and were taking prt in a three
weeks' training, he said.
   The names of the dead were not immediately released.
   The Blackhawk, among the Army's newer helicopters, is made by
Sikorksy Aircraft. The Pentagon sold five to Colombia last February
for use in fighting drug traffickers.
   The Army grounded its fleet of more than 800 Blackhawks twice in
May 1987, once for inspection and once to correct what was called a
design flaw.

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Wednesday overturning contempt fines against four Yonkers,
N.Y., councilmen.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion of the court.
   This case is the most recent episode of a lengthy lawsuit in
which the city of Yonkers was held liable for intentionally
enhancing racial segregation in housing in Yonkers. The issue here
is whether it was a proper exercise of judicial power for the
District Court to hold petitioners, four Yonkers city council
members, in contempt for refusing to vote in favor of legislation
implementing a consent decree earlier approved by the city. We hold
that in the circumstances of this case the District Court abused
its discretion.
</TEXT>

<BYLINE>SPALLONE v. UNITED STATES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The issue before us is relatively narrow. There can be no
question about the liability of the city of Yonkers for racial
discrimination: the District Court imposed such liability on the
city, its decision was affirmed in all respects by the Court of
Appeals, and we denied certiorari. Nor do we have before us any
question as to the District Court's remedial order; the Court of
Appeals found that it was within the bounds of proper discretion,
United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Ed., 837 F. 2d, at 1236, and we
denied certiorari. Our focus, then, is only on the District Court's
order of July 26 imposing comtempt sanctions on the individual
petitioners if they failed to vote in favor of the ordinance in
question.
   Petitioners contend that the District Court's orders violate
their rights to freedom of speech under the First Amendment, and
they also contend that they are entitled as legislators to absolute
immunity for actions taken in discharge of their legislative
responsibilities. We find it unnecessary to reach either of these
questions, because we conclude that the portion of the District
Court's order of July 26 imposing contempt sanctions against the
petitioners if they fgailed to vote in favor of the court-proposed
ordinance was an abuse of discretion under traditional equitable
principles.
   Before discussing the principles informing our conclusion, it is
important to note the posture of the case before the District Court
at the time it entered the order in question. Petitioners were
members of the city council of the city of Yonkers, and if the city
were to enact legislation it would have to be by their doing. But
petitioners had never been made parties to the action, and the
District Court's order imposed liability only on the named
defendants in the action _ the city of Yonkers and the Yonkers
Community Development Agency.

<TEXT>
   In selecting a means to enforce the consent judgment, the
District Court was entitled to rely on the axiom that ``courts have
inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders
through civil contempt.'' Shillitani v. United States, 384 U.S.
364, 370 (1966).
   Given that the city had entered a consent judgment committing
itself to enact legislation implementing the long-term plan, we
certainly cannot say it was an abuse of discretion for the District
Court to have chosen contempt sanctions against the city, as
opposed to petitioners, as a means of ensuring compliance. The
city, as we have noted, was a party to the action from the
beginning, had been found liable for numerous statutory and
constitutional violations, and had been subjected to various
elaborate remedial decrees which had been upheld on appeal.
Petitioners, the individual city councilmen, on the other hand,
were not parties to the action, and they had not been found
individually liable for any of the violations upon which the
remedial decree was based. Although the injunctive portion of that
decree was directed not only to the city but to ``its officers,
agents, employees, successors and all persons in active concert or
participation with any of them,'' App. 20, the remaining parts of
the decree ordering affirmative steps were directed only to the
city.
   The nub of the matter, then, is whether in the light of the
reasonable probability that sanctions against the city would
accomplish the desired result, it was within the court's discretion
to impose sanctions on the petitioners as well under the
circumstances of this case.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>___</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sanctions directed against the city for failure to take actions
such as required by the consent decree coerce the city legislators
and, of course, restrict the freedom of those legislators to act in
accordance with their current view of the city's best interests.
But we believe there are significant differences between the two
types of fines. The imposition of sanctions on individual
legislators is designed to cause them to vote, not with a view to
the interest of their constituents or of the city, but with a view
solely to their own personal interests. Even though an individual
legislator took the extreme position _ or felt that his
constituents took the extreme position _ that even a huge fine
against the city was preferable to enacting the Affordable Housing
Ordinance, monetary sanctions against him individually would
motivate him to vote to enact the ordinance simply because he did
not want to be out of pocket financially. Such fines thus encourage
legislators, in effect, to declare that they favor an ordinance not
in order to avoid bankrupting the city for which they legislate,
but in order to avoid bankrupting themselves.
   This sort of individual sanction effects a much greater
perversion of the normal legislative process than does the
imposition of sanctions on the city for the failure of these same
legislators to enact an ordinance. In that case, the legislator is
only encouraged to vote in favor of an ordinance that he would not
otherwise favor by reason of the adverse sanctions imposed on the
city. A councilman who felt that his constituents would rather have
the city enact the Affordable Housing Ordinance than pay a
``bankrupting fine'' would be motivated to vote in favor of such an
ordinance because the sanctions were a threat to the fiscal
solvency of the city for whose welfare he was in part responsible.
This is the sort of calculus in which legislators engage regularly.
   We hold that the District Court, in view of the
``extraordinary'' nature of the imposition of sanctions against the
individual councilmen, should have proceeded with such contempt
sanctions first against the city alone in order to secure
compliance with the remedial orders. Only if that approach failed
to produce compliance within a reasonable time should the question
of imposing contempt sanctions against petitioners even have been
considered.

   Floodwaters up to 4 feet deep breached a dike today and combined
with mudslides to force hundreds from their homes in Washington.
Oregon's governor declared emergencies in two counties where roads
were under 6 feet of water.
   ``The dike has been breached and they couldn't hold it back with
sandbags,'' Fire Chief Chuck Newbury said in Centralia, Wash.,
where the Skookumchuck River overflowed.
   In southern Washington, Interstate 5, the region's major
north-south route, was closed because of flooding brought on by the
third Pacific storm in four days. The main Amtrak and Burlington
Northern railroad line was washed out.
   A sheriff in Clatsop County, Ore., called the flooding in his
area the worst in decades.
   Newbury said 400 people were evacuated in Centralia early today
as water rose to 3 to 4 feet deep in the town of 11,000 people, 80
miles southwest of Seattle. National Guardsmen helped set up
shelters at churches.
   A firefighter, Tim Evans, said a line of sandbags was laid out
late Tuesday by a motel, ``but the river blew it out.''
Firefighters were called to the motel ``and the water was just
coming in like the tide,'' he said.
   Bob Berg, Lewis County public works director, guessed that 1,000
people countywide were out of their homes.
   Peter Feist, 68, said he decided against leaving his Centralia
home `but the water kept getting higher and I changed my mind.''
   Flood warnings were in effect today in Seattle and other cities
along Puget Sound and eight major rivers in Washington. The
National Weather Service predicted major damage this afternoon
along the Chehalis River in the southwestern part of the state.
   The weather service said no more storms were moving in from the
ocean, and the rains eased this morning. The weather service was
forecasting only scattered showers for the next few days.
   ``This looks like the last one coming from this direction,''
said forecaster John Jannuzzi. ``But it's going to be really slow
to leave.''
   The earlier storms, with gusts reaching more than 90 mph, killed
two people in Oregon and caused at least $12.5 million in damage
since Saturday.
   Utility crews today worked to restore service to the last of
tens of thousands of customers who lost electricity in both states.
Portland General Electric Co. reported about 6,400 customers
without power Tuesday night.
   Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt declared an emergency in Clatsop
and Tillamook counties in the northwest corner of the state.
   Flooding in the southern part of Clatsop County was the worst in
decades, with water 6 feet deep on some roads, said Sheriff John
Raichl.
   Seaside, Ore., reported more than 6{ inches of rain in 24 hours
and 73 mph gusts, Astoria, Ore., got nearly 5 inches of rain and
Olympia, Wash., got 4{ inches, the weather service said.
   All rivers in Tillamook County were over their banks, said Paul
Levesque, the county's assistant director of emergency management.
   The Nehalem River crested at 12 feet above flood stage near
Foss, and the Wilson River near Tillamook crested at 5 feet above
flood stage at Tillamook, he said.
   ``In fact, in the area north of town, one of the businessmen
noticed it dropped a foot in the past hour in his showroom,''
Levesque said this morning.
   Goldschmidt ordered National Guardsmen to help volunteers with
evacuations.
   The Guard helped take people to a hospital in Clatsop County
where the access road was under 3 feet of water. But in Tillamook,
Levesque said, ``By the time the (Guard) authorization came from
the governor's office, the job was done with volunteers.''
   He estimated 25 people were moved from their homes in the lower
Nehalem River area.
   A motorist was injured in a mudslide Tuesday morning on a
highway near Westport, about 20 miles east of Astoria, officials
said.
   In Washington, numerous mudslides occurred in Lewis County, and
swift-flowing water from China Creek flooded 12 blocks in downtown
Centralia.
   Authorities reported evacuations of a nursing home with 83
residents in McKenna, the Centralia Convalescent Center with about
60 patients, a senior center with 50 residents in Pierce County,
private homes with at least 100 people in Thurston County, and 16
families south of Seattle.
   A driver and 10 kindergarten pupils were trapped briefly in a
school bus that was caught by high water near Puyallup. All were
rescued.
   Interstate 5, used by an estimated 25,000 vehicles a day, was
closed as more than a foot of water covered the road at Centralia.
   Burlington Northern's main north-south railroad lines were cut
by a washout Tuesday evening near the Lewis-Cowlitz county line,
and Amtrak passengers were being taken by bus between Centralia and
Portland.

   Premier Li Peng lifted Beijing's 7-month-old
martial law Wednesday night and said that by crushing pro-democracy
protests, the army had saved China from ``the abyss of misery.''
   The largely symbolic action appeared intended chiefly to ease
foreign criticism of China's harsh crackdown on dissent and cue the
World Bank and industrialized nations to restore badly needed soft
loans.
   Vice President Dan Quayle called the move a ``step forward for
human rights'' and a dividend of recent U.S. overtures to China. A
White House spokesman said there was no change in the U.S. economic
sanctions against China, but hinted that the United States stands
ready to back World Bank loans for China for humanitarian needs.
   Western diplomats in Beijing linked Li's action to the December
visit of U.S. National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, who sought
an easing of China's crackdown in exchange for normalizing
bilateral relations.
   Li, however, sought to portray the end of martial law as a sign
of its success. He said it proved that ``the Chinese Communist
Party, the Chinese government and the Chinese people are capable of
running their own affairs well.''
   Martial law officially ended at midnight Wednesday (11 a.m. EST
Wednesday).
   Li imposed martial law in Beijing for the first time in 40 years
of Communist rule on May 20, after more than 1 million people had
filled Beijing streets to support student-led pro-democracy
protesters.
   In his 10-minute speech Wednesday night, broadcast on national
TV and radio, Li said martial law was ``timely, necessary and
correct.'' If he had not acted, he said, Chinese ``would have again
fallen into the abyss of misery.''
   ``China is now stable politically, economically and socially;
production and lives are in good order. ... People live and work in
peace and contentment,'' he said.
   He stressed that the party was not softening its opposition to
efforts to ``attempts to subvert the socialist system.''
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, used even stronger
language, declaring: ``It is imperative to smash the sabotage of
hostile forces.''
   Beijing streets and college campuses remained quiet after the
speech. Several students said the end of martial law made no
difference, and noted that tight campus security would remain.
   Asked if any students were likely to try to renew calls for
democracy, one woman student said: ``We're about to go on winter
holiday _ we've all already bought our tickets to go home.''
   There was little outward sign of the lifting of martial law. In
October, the government pulled army guards off the streets,
although they remain in and around the city in walled compounds.
   Special armed police who had guarded the perimeter of Tiananmen
Square _ the focal point of the spring protests _ withdrew at
midnight, but others remained at the flagpole in the square and the
monument to revolutionary martyrs, both guarded even before martial
law.
   Police officers said civilians can now enter the square freely,
unlike during martial law, but they still tried to wave away
passing bicyclists who stopped and climbed over a metal railing
into the square. A new sign went up saying the steps of the
monument, used by the protesters as a speaking platform, will
remain off-limits.
   Early Thursday, police checkpoints remained on major Beijing
roads.
   Documents distributed to government officials this week said Li
would announce the lifting of martial law on Tuesday, 24 hours
before he actually did. There was no explanation for the delay.
   He spoke sitting at a desk, his hands folded in front of him
most of the time, and wore a Western-style suit.
   On May 19, when he announced the government would not permit the
student-led protests to continue, he wore a more ideologically
conservative Mao suit and waved his arms agitatedly. He issued the
martial law order the next day.
   Even without martial law, Chinese security forces have wide
authority to quell dissent. The government passed a law in November
banning all but pro-government demonstrations, and strikes and
putting up political posters are already illegal.
   Students and other Chinese said lifting martial law would make
little difference to them.
   ``It won't have any effect on most people's lives,'' said a
young woman. ``Of course, they may feel more light-hearted, to know
that martial law is gone. But that's all.''
   In Hong Kong, some drivers honked their car horns after hearing
the news.
   But Martin Lee, a member of Hong Kong's legislative council and
advocate of democratic reform, said the move was ``simple political
posturing.''
   ``They have changed nothing,'' he said. ``They might just be
done for the time being with bloodshed.''

   Even Richard Nixon agreed that the
library honoring him would not be complete without a mention of
Watergate.
   So the new Richard M. Nixon Library will include not only a
Watergate Room, but some of the recorded telephone and conversation
tapes revealing the former president's role in the scandal cover-up
that led to his downfall, library officials said.
   ``The president is committed to the full and fair treatment of
Watergate, and, yes, the tapes will be available,'' said Hugh
Hewitt, library executive director.
   ``The president has said choose any (tapes),'' said Alexander
Cranstoun, vice president of DeMartin Marona Cranstoun and Downes
Inc. of New York, the design firm developing the library exhibits.
   ``We obviously can't play them all,'' Cranstoun said. ``But our
instructions are to select the most damning. He's placed no
restrictions on us.''
   Also planned for the library, to be dedicated July 19, is a
World Leaders Room that will have statues of 10 dignitaries, such
as Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union and China's Mao Tse-tung.
   Push a button and they will share their impressions of Nixon on
a screen, said Cranstoun. ``It's almost like a cocktail party after
a world summit, and you will be there,'' he said.
   The 37th president reportedly plans to attend the dedication of
the privately funded, $20 million library located next to his
birthplace. The 52,000-square-foot, Spanish-style library and wood
farmhouse open to the public July 20.

   Justice Brennan, with whom Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun,
and Justice Stevens join, dissenting.
   I understand and appreciate the Court's concern about the
District Court's decision to impose contempt sanctions against
local officials acting in a legislative capacity. We must all hope
that no court wil ever again face the open and sustained official
defiance of established constitutional values and valid judicial
orders that prompted Judge Sand's invocation of the contempt power
in this manner. But I firmly believe that its availability for such
use, in extreme circumstances, is essential. As the District Court
was aware:
   ``The issues transcend Yonkers. They go to the very foundation
of the system of constitutional government. If Yonkers can defy the
orders of a federal court in any case, but especially a civil
rights case, because compliance is unpopular, and if that situation
is tolerated, then our constitutional system of government fails.
the issues before the court this morning are no less significant
than that.''
   The Court today recognizes that it was appropriate for the
District Court to hold in contempt and fine the city of Yonkers to
encourage the city councilmembers to comply with their prior
promise to redress the city's history of racial segregation. Yet
the Court also reprimands the District Court for simultaneously
fining the individual councilmembers whose continuing defiance was
the true source of the impasse, holding that personal sanctions
should have been considered only after the city sanctions first
proved fruitless.
   I cannot accept the parsimonious view of the District Court's
discretion to wield the power of contempt. Judge Sand's intimate
contact for many years with the recalcitrant councilmembers and his
familiarity with the city's political climate gave him special
insight into the best way to coerce compliance when all cooperative
efforts had failed. From our detached vantage point, we can hardly
judge as well as he which coercive sanctions or combination thereof
were most likely to work quickly and least disruptively. Because
the Court's ex post rationalization of what Judge Sand should have
done fails to do justice either to the facts of this case or the
art of judging, I must dissent.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>___</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   After according no weight to Judge Sand's cautious and
contextual judgment despite his vastly superior vantage point, the
Court compounds its error by committing two more. First, the Court
turns a blind eye to most of the evidence available to Judge Sand
suggesting that, because of the councilmembers' continuing
intransigence, sanctions against the city alone might not coerce
compliance and that personal sanctions would significantly increase
the chance of success. Second, the Court fails to acknowledge that
supplementing city sanctions with personal ones likely would secure
compliance more promptly, minimizing the overall disruptive effect
of the city sanctions on city services generally and long-term
compliance with the Consent Decree in particular.
   As the events leading up to the Contempt Order make clear, the
recalcitrant councilmembers were extremely responsive to the strong
segments of their constituencies that were vociferously opposed to
racial residential integration. . .
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>___</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Court, in addition to ignoring all of this evidence before
concluding that the city sanctions alone would eventually coerce
compliance, also inexplicably ignores the fact that imposing
personal fines in addition to sanctions against the city would not
only help ensure but actually hasten compliance. . .
   Given these ancillary effects of city sanctions. it seems to me
entirely appropriate _ indeed obligatory _ for Judge Sand to have
considered, not just whether city sanctions alone would eventually
have coerced compliance, but also how promptly they would have done
so. . .
   In sum, the record does not support the Court's casual
conclusion today that Judge Sand should have perceived a
``reasonable probability that sanctions against the city (alone)
would accomplish the desired result.'' Ante, at 12. Rather, the
city councilmembers' vehement and unyielding defiance of Judge
Sand's remedial orders, and his political acumen borne of eight
years' firsthand experience with the Yonkers political environment,
led him quite reasonably to believe that city sanctions alone would
have induced compliance only slowly if at all and at great cost to
the city and long-term remedial success, and that personal
sanctions would enhance both the promptness and ultimate likelihood
of compliance. Under these circumstances, Judge Sand's cautious
exercise of contempt power was within the permissible bounds of his
remedial discretion. The Court's determination to play district
court-for-a-day _ and to do so poorly _ is indefensible.

   I concede that personal sanctions against legislators
intuitively may seem less appropriate than more traditional forms
of coercing compliance with court orders. But this intuition does
not withstand close scrutiny given the circumstances of this case.
When necessary, courts levy personal contempt sanctions against
other types of state and local officials for flouting valid court
orders, and I see no reason to treat local legislators differently
when they are acting outside of their ``sphere of legitimate
legislative activity.'' Tenney, 341 U.S., at 376.
   The key question here, therefore, is whether Judge Sand abused
his discretion when he decided not to rely on sanctions against the
city alone but also to apply coercive pressure to the reclcitrant
councilmembers on an individual basis. Given the city council's
consistent defiance and the delicate political situation in
Yonkers, Judge Sand was justifiably uncertain as to whether city
sanctions alone would coerce compliance at all and, if so, whether
they would do so promptly; the longer the delay in compliance, the
more likely that city services would be curtailed drastically and
that both budgetary constraints and growing racial tensions would
undermine the long-term efficacy of the remedial decree. Under
these conditions, Judge Sand's decision to supplement the city
sanctions with personal fines was surely a sensible approach. The
Court's contrary judgment rests on its refusal to take the
fierceness of the councilmembers' defiance seriously, a refusal
blind to the scourge of racial politics in Yonkers and dismissive
of Judge Sand's wisdom borne of his superior vantage point.

   The Court's decision today that Judge Sand abused his remedial
discretion by imposing personal fines simultaneously with city
fines creates no new principle of law; indeed, it invokes no
principle of any sort. But it directs a message to district judges
that, despite their repeated and close contact with the various
parties and issues, even the most delicate remedial choices by the
most conscientious and deliberate judges are subject to being
second-guessed by this Court.
   I hope such a message will not daunt the courage of district
courts who, if ever again faced with such protracted defiance, must
carefully yet firmly secure compliance with their remedial orders.
But I worry that the Court's message will have the unintended
effect of emboldening recalcitrant officials continually to test
the ultimate reach of the remedial authority of the federal courts,
thereby postponing the day when all public officers finally accept
that ``the responsibility of those who exercise power in a
democratic government is not to reflect inflamed public feeling but
to help form its understanding.''

   The paperwork generated by the takeover
battle between paper giants Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. has become so immense that a judge has
stepped in to free up the court clerk's copy machine.
   Ever since Georgia-Pacific began its unsolicited $3.8 billion
bid to acquire Great Northern Nekoosa in October, and Great
Northern began court fights to stop its rival, the joke has been
that the legal jockeying will consume enough paper to keep both
companies in business for years.
   ``Counsel on all sides of this case have, by virtue of their
written submissions, given ample evidence of their devotion to the
mercantile interests of the paper industry,'' U.S. District Judge
Gene Carter said during a December hearing.
   As the battle wore on, the flow of paper, and countless requests
for copies, finally overwhelmed the court clerk's office.
   Carter issued an order, filed Tuesday and made available
Wednesday, that the clerk's office begin sending everything
involved in the companies' five lawsuits to a nearby Xpress Copy
store, so the store can make copies and sell them to the public.
   ``The volume of copy people wanted from them was too much for
them,'' said Philip Rhinelander, whose Xpress Copy store can
produce 20,000 pages an hour. ``From our perspective, this is just
another job.''
   Ironically, the judge's order will save money for lawyers,
reporters and others buying copies of the various legal papers. The
court clerk charged 50 cents a sheet while Xpress Copy is charging
21 cents, including delivery.
   Georgia-Pacific had no estimate of how much paper the legal
battle here and in Bridgeport, Conn., could eventually consume.
   ``Heaven only knows,'' spokeswoman Gail Smith said from Atlanta.
``I've got a huge stack of stuff that's been issued, but I have no
idea how much will be generated in the future.''
   Rhinelander was unsure whether the paper he will use would come
from either Georgia-Pacific or Great Northern mills. Most paper
comes out under brand names that would not indicate which mill it
had come from, and Xpress Copy buys from whichever supplier offers
the best rates, he said.
   The legal struggle is going on in both Portland and Bridgeport
because Great Northern is incorporated in Maine but has its
headquarters at Norwalk, Conn.
   Court workers in Bridgeport report ``a whole lot of paper'' is
being generated there, but not enough to cause problems.

   The Columbia astronauts put a Navy
communications satellite into orbit Wednesday and continued to
close in on the path of a floating science laboratory they hope to
snatch from space.
   ``It was an outstanding morning,'' flight director Al Pennington
said shortly after the release of the 15,200-pound Syncom
satellite. ``So everything looks real good right now. It's a great
ship up there they're flying and it continues to perform
beautifully.''
   After the satellite was released, the astronauts turned their
attention to the other major task of the mission, tracking down the
21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility so it can be brought
back to Earth.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee steered the
space shuttle through additional maneuvers to help the orbiter
catch up to the bus-size LDEF. If the astronauts fail, the
satellite is expected to be pulled to its destruction in a fiery
dive through Earth's atmosphere on March 9.
   Columbia is in a slightly lower orbit than LDEF, which enables
it to circle the globe a little faster and gradually narrow the
distance between it and the satellite. The shuttle was closing in
on LDEF at a rate of about 40 miles per 91-minute orbit Wednesday.
   When the shuttle lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on
Tuesday, it was 1,725 miles behind LDEF. By the time the five crew
members ended their workday Wednesday afternoon, they were about
750 miles from their target.
   The chase should end Friday morning when mission specialist
Bonnie Dunbar plans to use the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to latch
onto LDEF and tuck it into the cargo bay for the trip home.
   Scientists are eager to see what has happened to the 57
self-contained experiments aboard during nearly six years of
exposure to spae. LDEF was to have been retrieved 10 months after a
shuttle put it into orbit in 1984, but scheduling problems and the
1986 Challenger disaster delayed the retrieval.
   Columbia mission specialists Dunbar, David Low and Marsha Ivins
worked on several experiments of their own, concentrating on
materials processing and tests of how well the human body adapts to
living in weightlessness.
   The major task Wednesday, deploying the $85 million Syncom
satellite, was completed in the morning when it slipped from its
berth in the cargo bay and spun away. Forty-five minutes later, an
onboard motor fired to propel the satellite toward its permanent
working post 22,300 miles above the Pacific.
   The satellite, built by Hughes Aircraft, will complete a network
of five satellites through which the Pentagon communicates with its
planes, ships and bases around the world.
   Columbia's 10-day mission is the second-longest in 33 shuttle
missions. It is a step toward even longer flights leading to
extended stays in space of several months aboard space station
Freedom later in this decade.
   Columbia will be modified for 16-day flights starting in 1993. A
new orbiter being built, Endeavour, will be capable of 28-day trips.

<TEXT>
   A seemingly skeptical Supreme Court heard
arguments Wednesday in the complex case of an Arkansas mass
murderer who wants to be executed.
   In comments from the bench, five of the nine justices questioned
whether the court could use the case of R. Gene Simmons, who killed
16 relatives and acquaintances in 1987, to decide whether state
appellate courts must review all death sentences.
   Little Rock lawyer Arthur Allen, who represents another Arkansas
death row inmate, called the state's death penalty law
``unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Simmons.''
   ``This may, in fact, be a person who is not eligible for the
death penalty under the law,'' Allen said of Simmons.
   But Arkansas Attorney General Steve Clark defended the law, and
argued that Allen's client, convicted killer Jonas Whitmore, lacks
the proper legal standing to challenge the law in Simmons' place.
   Whitmore ``would love to frustrate the death penalty in
Arkansas,'' Clark said, but should not be allowed to do so because
his personal stake is ``speculative, conjectural and hypothetical.''
   In questions posed to Allen during an hour-long argument
session, five justices appeared to agree with Clark's assessment of
Whitmore's legal standing.
   If the court were to rule that Whitmore lacks the proper legal
standing to challenge state's death penalty law in this case, the
way would be cleared for Simmons' execution.
   Such a decision, in practical terms, would insulate any state's
death penalty law from legal challenge in a case in which the
defendant chose not to appeal.
   The court's decision is expected by July.
   In what prosecutors called a murderous rampage, Simmons, 49,
gunned down his wife, three sons, four daughters, a son-in-law, a
daughter-in-law, four grandchildren and two acquaintances within a
few days of Christmas 1987.
   After his convictions, Simmons said he wanted to die by lethal
injection as soon as possible and would not appeal.
   Three days before Simmons was to die last March 16, Whitmore
sought to challenge the state's death penalty law in his behalf.
   On the eve of the execution, the high court postponed Simmons'
death to study Whitmore's argument that the Constitution requires
state appellate courts to review all death sentences _ even when
the convicted defendant asks to die.
   Under Arkansas practice, the state appellate courts select only
certain death penalty cases in which to inquire whether the death
penalty is a ``proportionate'' punishment _ having been used in
similar cases.
   Under questioning by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Allen
conceded that Whitmore's standing to challenge the lack of such
review in Simmons' case is less than ``overwhelming.''
   Allen said Whitmore could be affected if his death penalty, now
being challenged in federal court, is overturned and he then is
convicted in a new state court trial.
   ``Why isn't that hypothetical?'' Justice Antonin Scalia asked.
``There's nothing really about to happen to him.''
   Similar questions were asked by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Byron R. White.
   ``Death is different. It is entitled to higher safeguards,''
Allen said at one point, noting that past decisions have emphasized
``the importance of appellate review'' in capital cases.
   But the state's attorney general said the state, which has 32
men on death row, does not impose the death penalty ``in an
arbitrary, capricious or freakish manner.''
   Of Simmons, Clark said, ``Clearly there has been a knowing and
intelligent waiver'' of his right to appeal.
   But Simmons could change his mind right up to the time of his
execution, Clark said, ``and an appeal would move forward.''
   The case is Whitmore vs. Arkansas, 88-7146.

   A sharply divided Supreme Court today
overturned contempt fines imposed against four Yonkers, N.Y., city
councilmen who defied a federal judge's order to adopt a housing
desegregation plan.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the judge who imposed the fines
exceeded his authority.
   Dissenting justices said today's ruling, which follows a series
of decisions last year that generally narrowed the scope of civil
rights laws, could hamstring judges in dealing with officials who
defy anti-discrimination court orders.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand acted too hastily in holding the
councilmen in contempt.
   The judge should have waited to see whether a contempt order
against the city that threatened to bankrupt it succeeded in
forcing compliance with Sand's desegregation order, Rehnquist said.
   Only if that failed, the chief justice said, should contempt
sanctions against the individual council members even have been
considered.
   ``The imposition of sanctions on individual legislators is
designed to cause them to vote, not with a view to the interest of
their constituents or of the city, but with a view solely to their
own personal interests,'' Rehnquist said. ``Thi sort of individual
sanction effects a much greater perversion of the normal
legislative process than does the imposition of sanctions on the
city.''
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said the
ruling may intimidate judges and give public officials more reason
to defy reasonable court orders.
   ``I worry that the court's message will have the unintended
effect of emboldening recalcitrant officials continually to test
the ultimate reach of the remedial authority of the federal
courts,'' he said.
   The end result could be the delaying of civil rights progress,
Brennan said.
   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens.
   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.
   Steven Shapiro, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties
Union, said, ``I think the decision is more significant as a
political symbol than legally. It will be perceived as a further
step away from the court's commitment to civil rights.''
   Councilman Edward Fagan, one of the four, said, ``It's a great
vindication. It proved the things I did were justified. It adds a
whole new impetus to continue the fight against the housing.''
   ``I'm looking forward to getting my money back,'' he added. he
was fined $3,500.
   The court in 1989 limited affirmative action, made it tougher to
prove job discrimination and restricted remedies for on-the-job
racial harassment. Those decisions touched off angry protests by
civil rights leaders.
   The Yonkers case attracted national attention in the summer of
1988 as the defiant councilmen were threatened with jail as well as
fines, and the city faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey
Sand's orders.
   Faced with massive layoffs of city workers, the city council
reversed itself and on Sept. 10, 1988, voted to comply with Sand's
order to build 1,000 low-cost homes to desegregate middle-class
areas of the city just north of New York City.
   But Yonkers still had to pay $819,000 in fines and the four
councilmen $3,500 apiece for being in contempt of the judge's order
from the previous Aug. 2.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Refused, by a 5-4 vote, to create a new exception to the rule
barring unlawfully obtained evidence from criminal trials.
   The court ruled in an Illinois case that statements a criminal
defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used by
prosecutors to contradict a defense witness' trial testimony.
   In a separate criminal law decision involving evidence, the
court ruled by a 6-3 vote that federal juries may be told about a
defendant's alleged prior criminal conduct even if a previous trial
on those charges ended in an acquittal.
   _ Limited the ability of multinational corporations to challenge
state taxes in federal court.
   The justices ruled unanimously that a law generally barring
federal courts from handling lawsuits that attack a state tax
applies to foreign-based multinational businesses.
   The Yonkers case stems from a Justice Department lawsuit begun
by the Carter administration in its waning days in 1980.
   Sand in 1985 ruled that Yonkers officials intentionally and
unlawfully promoted racial segregation through their housing and
school policies. He ordered the city to desegregate the school
system and build subsidized housing in predominantly white sections
of the city.
   City officials agreed in January 1988 to build 200 units and
make plans for 600 more but later sought to back out of the
agreement.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August 1988 said Sand
acted properly in holding the city and the four councilmen in
contempt after the council voted 4-3 against a package of financial
incentives designed to attract development of the 800 low- and
moderate-income homes.
   Sand imposed fines against the city starting at $100 a day and
doubling daily until it complied with the desegregation agreement.
The appeals court put a cap of $1 million a day on the fines and
upheld the judge's $500-a-day fines for each councilman.
   The threat of jail terms was lifted after the council relented
and adopted the desegregation plan.
   The four councilmen are Fagan, Nicholas V. Longo, Peter Chema
and Vice Mayor Henry Spallone.
   They said their free-speech and lgislative-immunity rights were
violated by the contempt citation.
   The cases are Spallone vs. U.S., 88-854; Chema vs. U.S., 88-856,
Longo vs. U.S., 88-870.

   A former Anglican priest with a wife and four
children will be ordained a Roman Catholic priest Saturday,
according to the Archdiocese of New York.
   Trevor Nicholls, 47, will be ordained by Cardinal John O'Connor
at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. He was ordained a deacon, the
highest position a layman may attain, last month.
   Unlike most Christian denominations, the Roman Catholic church
generally insists that its priests be single and celibate. But 10
years ago the Vatican said American bishops could ordain some
Anglican or Episcopalian priests who were married and who had left
their churches and converted to Catholicism.
   Since then, more than 50 married converts have been ordained as
Roman Catholic priests in the United States, the archdiocese said
Wednesday. Several had left their churches because they were
opposed to liberal reforms, such as the ordination of women.
   Nicholls, who teaches at a Catholic high school in Kingston,
north of New York City, has four children, ages 8 to 20.
Archdiocesan officials said they were not sure when he left the
Anglican church, or the Church of England, which is related to the
Episcopal Church in the United States.
   Nicholls was not at school Wednesday, and there was no answer at
his home phone in Kingston.

   Topol was only 30 when he began playing dairyman Tevye in
``Fiddler on the Roof,'' which opens Thursday night at the Forrest

   A government lawyer told the Supreme Court
Wednesday that the Army correctly refused to bargain over teacher
wages and fringe benefits at two Army-run schools in Georgia
because Congress never meant for the pay of any federal employee to
be negotiable.
   Christopher J. Wright, an assistant to the U.S. solicitor
general, urged the justices to overturn an appeals court ruling
that the Army must negotiate monetary issues with unions for
teachers at schools the Army operates for the children of military
and civilian personnel at Fort Stewart.
   ``No one ever said on the floor of Congress that employees like
the teachers could bargain over pay,'' Wright said.
   The teachers union at the two elementary schools, an affiliate
of the National Education Association, sought a 13.5 percent wage
increase in 1987 and various fringe benefit improvements.
   The Army refused to negotiate the monetary issues but was
ordered to do so by the Federal Labor Relations Authority, an
independent agency set up within the executive branch to mediate
disputes between federal employees and federal agencies.
   The Army's appeal of the FLRA decision was rejected by the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and the Supreme Court
then agreed to review the case, which could affect all federal
employees whose pay is not fixed by law.
   William E. Persina, lawyer for the FLRA, said federal agencies
are required by law to negotiate with employee unions over
``personnel policies, practices and working conditions'' unless
such matters are specifically spelled out in law.
   Thus, he said, the salaries of 97 percent of the federal
workforce clearly are not negotiable because they are fixed by law,
but Congress never has established salary schedules for the other 3
percent, including school employees.
   ``If Congress had wanted to make the pay of these teachers
non-negotiable, it would have said so in the statute,'' Persina
argued, just as it did for the overwhelming majority of the
workforce whose pay is set by law.
   Wright argued that requiring the Army to negotiate over wages
would interfere with the Army's right to set its own budget and
would violate an Army rule that teacher salaries in its dependents
schools should be comparable to those paid teachers in local public
schools.
   But Persina said the Army never made any attempt to prove to the
FLRA that the union's wage and fringe benefit proposal would force
the Army to seek additional, unbudgeting funds from Congress.
   Before citing the budget to refuse to negotiate a monetary
proposal, Persina said, the Army must show that the proposal
``entails significant and unavoidable costs that are not offset by
other compensating benefits,'' including such intangibles as
improved employee morale and lower turnover.
   As for the Army rule requiring comparable teacher pay, Persina
said it does not preclude negotiations over wages and fringe
benefits, because comparable pay is not an essential element of a
comparable education, which is the only requirement Congress has
spelled out in law for the dependents schools.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leaders Said to be Inflexible in Bid to Settle Conflict</HEAD>

   Indonesia's foreign minister met with
Cambodian guerrilla leaders Wednesday and said they appeared
inflexible in efforts to settle their 11-year-old war against the
Vietnamese-installed government.
   Sources in Phnom Penh confirmed that explosions had hit the
capital and that Khmer Rouge guerrillas had attacked near the
second-largest city over the weekend. But they said Khmer Rouge
claims of success were exaggerated.
   Cambodia's Communist premier, Hun Sen, said he feared the Khmer
Rouge could return to power and said he would bolster government
forces ``at all costs.''
   Diplomatic attempts to settle the conflict have intensified
since September, when Vietnam said it withdrew all its troops.
   The Indonesian official, Ali Alatas, met in Bangkok with Khmer
Rouge leaders and those from the U.S.-backed, non-Communist forces
of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front.
   Asked if the Khmer Rouge had become more flexible in their
demands, he said: ``Everybody is persistent on their own
positions.''
   Fears of a battlefield victory by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest
of three guerrilla groups, have risen with its reports that Khmer
Rouge guerrillas forced the Communist leadership to flee the
capital in grenade attacks Saturday and briefly captured Cambodia's
No. 2 city over the weekend.
   Khieu Kanharith, editor of the government-sponsored weekly
newspaper Kampuchea, said four or five plastic explosives went off
in the streets of Phnom Penh on Friday and Saturday night, causing
no injuries or damage.
   ``There weren't even any broken windows,'' he said by telephone.
   Kanharith denied Khmer Rouge guerrilla claims that grenades were
used and that the blasts had forced Vietnamese-installed President
Heng Samrin to flee.
   In Battambang, fighting was limited to villages six to nine
miles away, said Kanharith. That city also was quiet Wednesday, he
said.
   The official Phnom Penh radio said 100 to 200 communist Khmer
Rouge guerrillas attacked at midnight Friday through four suburbs
of Battambang in an attempt to blow up an bridge.
   ``Our armed forces repelled the enemies, forcing them to retreat
completely and leave behind nine bodies on the battlefield, along
with nine weapons,'' said the Tuesday night broadcast. A transcript
was seen in Bangkok on Wednesday.
   Fighting has raged in Cambodia since Vietnamese troops in late
1978 ended the brutal 3{-year reign of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, which
killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians while trying to create a
primitive agrarian society.
   The Khmer Rouge has said it would fight until a coalition
government including Hun Sen's government and the guerrilla groups
was formed.
   Alatas also met with the foriegn minister of Thailand, which
backs the guerrillas, and with an envoy from Australia, which has
proposed that Cambodia be administered by the United Nations until
free elections are held.
   Alatas, a key player in several regional peace efforts and a
U.N. conference last summer, hoped to meet Sunday or Monday with
Vietnamese Foriegn Minister Nguyen Co Thach and Hun Sen.
   Asked about the possibility of a new round of peace talks, the
minister replied: ``It is still open.''
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _
Britain, China France, the Soviet Union and the United States _
will meet in Paris on Monday and Tuesday to discuss peace
proposals, including the Australian plan.
   The resistance leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, said Wednesday
in Beijing that he supported a proposed U.N. administration,
including a U.N. military presence in his country for up to 10
years, but would not give up the U.N. seat until Hun Sen's
government is dismantled.
   The official radio said Hun Sen has agreed to a U.N. role in an
interim administration only if the U.N. seat held by the guerrillas
first is vacated.
   Hun Sen made his appeal for more government troops in a speech
Saturday. A copy of the speech was received in Bangkok on Wednesday.
   ``This duty must be carried out at all costs,'' he said. ``We
must strengthen the armed forces. Without the armed forces, we
cannot survive.''

   A worker helping build the Channel Tunnel
between Britain and France was struck by an underground train and
killed Wednesday, the fifth person to die on the project, Kent
County police said.
   Police identified the victim as Keith Lynch, 34, and said the
accident occurred in the tunnel about a half-mile from the
Shakespeare Cliff site at Dover.
   Construction of the 34-mile tunnel began in December 1987, and
it is scheduled to open in May 1993.
   Three British workers have been killed in accidents on the
British side and one French worker on the other side at Calais.
   The tunnel is being bored simultaneously from both sides of the
English Channel, which France calls La Manche _ the Sleeve.

<HEAD>U.S. Defends Surrounding Peruvian Envoy's Residence in Panama</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs first 2 grafs to CORRECT embassy to ambassador's

   The United States on Wednesday defended
surrounding the Peruvian ambassador's residence in Panama City,
saying the action was being taken at the request of the new
Panamanian government.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S.
troops are on the lookout for suspected criminals who may have
taken refuge in the residence and are carrying out their role of
providing security assistance until the government of Guillermo
Endara is able to solidify its own police force.
   Tutwiler acknowledged that Peru had formally protested the U.S.
action in a letter to the U.S. ambassador in Lima, Anthony
Quainton, but sought to minimize the protest, saying only that the
issue had been ``formally raised.''
   The letter complained that the action creates ``an unnecessary
climate of tension and impedes the normal development of activities
of our mission in Panama.''
   Three-way talks are under way among diplomats from Panama, Peru
and the United States to resolve the situation, Tutwiler said.
   Peru, which has been among the harshest critics in the
hemisphere of the U.S. invasion of Panama, has granted asylum to a
dozen Panamanians, including some military officers loyal to
deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Among those granted asylum is Gonzalo Gonzalez, identified by
Panamanian authorities as Noriega's former chief of security. Peru
has said the 12 will be allowed to come to Peru if they wish.
   Tutwiler said the United States hopes Peruvian President Alan
Garcia will attend a drug summit with President Bush and other
Andean presidents on Feb. 15 in Cartagena, Colombia.
   Following the U.S. invasion, Garcia said he would not attend,
but has been softening that stance and said Sunday he would go if
U.S. troops are first withdrawn from Panama.
   Tutwiler said U.S. troops over the last few days ``have been
surveilling persons whom the Panamanian government may wish to
investigate regarding past criminal activity.''
   She added that Panama was ``in the process of taking over this
responsibility'' and was still in the early stages of screening
people associated with Noriega for possible criminal prosecutions.
   Some individuals who are under U.S. indictments are also
believed to remain at large in Panama, she said.

<HEAD>Amazon Gold Prospectors Given Disputed Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MUELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has given gold
miners 1.6 million acres of land claimed by Yanomami Indians in
exchange for the prospectors' promise to leave a Yanomami
reservation that has been mined illegally for years.
   The agreement, announced Tuesday night and criticized by
environmentalists, does not guarantee the miners will stay off the
reservation, although it ended a tense standoff between thousands
of prospectors and government officials under pressure to preserve
the mineral-rich Indian land.
   ``This is the peaceful solution to the problem. There will be no
shock or confrontation,'' Justice Ministry spokesman Vinicius
Becker said Wednesday in Brasilia, the capital. He said the
agreement would be signed this week.
   Under the deal, the government called off efforts to remove an
estimated 40,000 miners from the reservation by force. The
prospectors agreed to surrender their guns and move from the
reservation onto 1.6 million acres of mostly virgin forest
bordering it.
   The Yanomamis, one of the world's largest primitive tribes, also
claim this land, but the government has declared it national forest.
   Becker acknowledged there is no way to ensure the miners will
live up to their part of the deal.
   ``The only thing that keeps them out (of the reservation) is the
constitution. We expect the miners to keep the agreement. If there
are violations, the government will act,'' he said.
   The Yanomami tribe once claimed 23 million acres in Brazil's
remote western Amazon territory, near the border with Venezuela.
   Over the years, the government whittled the Indians' property
down to 5 million acres, declaring the remainder national parks and
forests.
   An illegal gold rush began in 1987 after studies indicated a
wealth of gold, tin, bauxite, and diamonds on Yanomami land.
Environmentalists say the invasion devastated the peaceful tribal
life of the approximately 9,000 Yanomamis.
   Prospectors destroyed rain forest, spread disease and polluted
rivers with mercury, used in panning for gold.
   ``Because of the presence of miners, many Indians have malaria,
tuberculosis and venereal diseases. There also is a lot of
malnutrition, because fish and game have disappeared from some
areas,'' said Col. Airton Alcantara Gomes, the No. 2 official at
the National Indian Office.
   Olimpio Serra, president of the Virgin Forest Foundation ecology
group, said the latest decision was a defeat for the Indians and
will not solve the problem of rain forest destruction.
   ``We should find a solution that gives prospectors access to
other ore deposits. Further oppressing the weak is an unacceptable
decision,'' said Serra.
   Under the new agreement, the miners promised to use filters to
eliminate mercury, Becker said.
   Critics accused the federal government of caving in to local
political interests.
   The deal was proposed by territorial Gov. Romero Juca, who is
expected to run for the Senate in November, when the region attains
full statehood as Roraima and increases its number of congressmen.
   ``Indians don't vote. This absurdity explains in large part
what's going on in Roraima,'' the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo said
Wednesday.
   International outrage over the destruction of Yanomami land
forced the government to begin trying to remove the miners, who
vowed to resist such efforts.
   The $4 million expulsion operation began Monday, when federal
police with submachine guns occupied the airport in Boa Vista, the
capital of Roraima and the main supply point for the miners. Other
police teams closed dirt air strips and seized supplies and fuel
destined for the prospectors.
   The miners protested, and federal police chief Romeu Tuma flew
to Boa Vista on Tuesday to negotiate the agreement.

<HEAD>U.S. Upset over Planned Reopening of French Embassy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Wednesday expressed
disappointment with France's plan to reopen its embassy in
Afghanistan, saying the move would be used by the Kabul government
to claim it has international support.'
   A French Foreign Ministry spokesman had announced its intention
to reopen the outpost earlier Tuesday. France's deputy foreign
minister had insisted it had ``no political significance.''
   But Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, told
reporters the situation in Kabul remained ``precarious'' and said
the United States has no plans to reopen its embassy, which was
closed just before the Soviet army withdrew last year.
   ``Even though the French have said that the decision ... had no
political meaning, it is disappointing because it will be portrayed
by the illegitimate government in Kabul as an indication of support
for their regime,'' Tutwiler said.
   France will become the first major Western power to go back into
Kabul since the United States led a diplomatic exodus before the
February 1989 withdrawal of Soviet forces.
   The Soviet-backed government has proven more tenacious than
expected, and the United States believes any reopening of embassies
could signal that U.S.-backed rebels are not close to defeating the
regime.

<HEAD>Minneapolis Lawyer Accused of Insider Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators charged a
Minneapolis lawyer Wednesday with making $4.3 million in illegal
profits by trading on inside information about Grand Metropolitan
PLC's bid for The Pillsbury Co.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission also accused James H.
O'Hagan of engaging in insider trading to repay $1 million he
allegedly diverted from clients' accounts.
   O'Hagan's attorney in Minneapolis, Jan Stuurmans, was in a
meeting and not immediately available for comment.
   The SEC complaint, filed at federal court in Minneapolis,
accused O'Hagan, 53, formerly a partner in the firm of Dorsey &amp;
Whitney, of trading Pillsbury securities with misapropriated
confidential information in 1988 about Grand Met's pending hostile
tender offer.
   In July 1988, Dorsey &amp; Whitney was engaged as local counsel for
Grand Met, a British food and beverage producer, in the Pillsbury
matter. Grand Met eventually acquired Pillsbury in January 1989.
   O'Hagan left Dorsey &amp; Whitney in late February 1989, said Robert
Struyk, chairman of the Minneapolis-based law firm.
   He said O'Hagan, who specialized in securities, commodities and
medical malpractice litigation, ``had been with the firm since 1963
or 1964.''
   Struyck declined to comment further, noting that the matter was
now in litigation.
   But he emphasized that Dorsey &amp; Whitney ``is not involved in
this case in any way and we have been cooperating fully.''
   The complaint alleged that O'Hagan learned of the pending Grand
Met offer in July 1988 after speaking with another Dorsey &amp; Whitney
partner.
   According to the complaint, between late July and Sept. 21,
1988, O'Hagan bought Pillsbury stock and call options. On Oct. 4,
1988, Grand Met announced its cash tender offer for Pillsbury at
$60 per share, driving up the stock's price by $20.
   Between Oct. 5 and Oct. 17, O'Hagan sold his Pillsbury stock and
options, allegedly netting $4.35 million in profits.
   The SEC complaint alleged that O'Hagan, needed the trading
profits to repay ``approximately $1 million he had secretly
diverted from a D&amp;W client, Northrup King Co.''
   The complaint also alleged that had diverted funds ``from at
least two other D&amp;W clients'' which were not identified.

<HEAD>Former Premier Under Attack From Inside His Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Premier Jacques Chirac, a two-time loser as
a presidential candidate, has come under assault within his own
conservative party, which could drop him as leader at a convention
next month.
   The attack came Tuesday from both the right and left flanks of
the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party, which Chirac created
in 1976 and has dominated ever since.
   Two men who both served as Cabinet ministers under Chirac _
Charles Pasqua, leader of the party's conservative wing, and
Philippe Seguin, a leader of what is known as the ``renovators'' on
the left _ issued a statement saying the party ``has not recovered
confidence in itself, and as a result has never seemed so far away
from regaining the confidence of the French people.''
   They offered their eight-paragraph text as a motion to be voted
on at the Feb. 11 party congress.
   The Pasqua-Seguin statement made no direct reference to Chirac,
but no one was fooled.
   ``It's a struggle for power, it involves destabilizing Jacques
Chirac and myself,'' the party's secretary-general, Alain Juppe,
said in a radio interview Wednesday, who said Pasqua and Seguin
made an odd couple.
   ``It's a bizarre alliance,'' Juppe said. ``Several months ago
Philippe Seguin thought I was much too conservative and Charles
Pasqua thought I was much too understanding toward the renovators.''
   Pasqua has urged the party to compete for votes with the
extreme-right National Front, while Seguin has been more interested
in luring centrist supporters.
   About all that Seguin and Pasqua seem to share is a sense that
after following Chirac to defeat in two straight presidential
elections, the time has come to find a new candidate.
   Chirac, who served as premier from 1974-76 and again from
1986-88, ran for the first time in 1981, drawing only 18 percent of
the vote. He seemed to have a much better chance in 1988, but fell
to Socialist Francois Mitterrand's successful re-election bid. In
the runoff, Chirac drew 46 percent of the vote to Mitterrand's 54
percent.
   Known throughout his career for his boundless energy, Chirac has
been notably quiet since his May 1988 defeat, retreating to the job
he still holds as mayor of Paris. Even friendly observers have
asked whether the loss had sapped his appetite for the political
struggle.
   But within hours after Pasqua and Seguin issued their statement,
Chirac announced he would run again for the party leadership at the
February convention, a job that automatically makes him the party's
candidate if a presidential election is called.
   While Chirac looks more vulnerable than even, he has one big
advantage: there is no clear alternative with strong support inside
the party and good prospects in a presidential campaign.
   Voters are next scheduled to choose a president in 1995, but the
election could come sooner if the 73-year-old Mitterrand, who has
served more than eight years already, steps down or dies in office.
   The Rally for the Republic is not a conventional political
party. It is descended from the Union of Democrats for the
Republic, the grouping of Gen. Charles de Gaulle's supporters. De
Gaulle always insisted he drew from both the left and right of the
political spectrum, but over time the Gaullists have become a
conservative party.
   The Gaullist movement was in disarray in 1976 when Chirac quit
as premier, saying conservative President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
did not give him enough latitude to deal with the country's economy.
   Chirac then refounded the party under a new name, the Rally for
the Republic, and has been its unchallenged leader ever since.
   The party, known as the RPR from its French initials, competes
for conservative votes with an array of rightist, centrist and
center-right parties, most of which are allied in the Union for
French Democracy (UDF).
   A coalition of the RPR and UDF won the 1986 parliamentary
elections, forcing the Socialist Mitterrand to name a conservative
government led by Chirac, which ran the country for the next two
years under an uncomfortable arrangement called ``cohabitation.''

<HEAD>Baker Expresses Impatience Over Inaction on Mideast Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
expressing impatience, told Arabs and Israelis on Wednesday that
other areas of the world are ``clamoring'' for his attention while
the two camps hesitate on opening Mideast peace talks.
   The statement, issued through spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler,
appeared to be a veiled warning to the two sides to come to terms
on holding talks here or risk losing U.S. help in mediating their
dispute.
   Baker hopes to bring the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers
to Washington soon to discuss holding an election among Palestinian
Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   But sparring over whether the Palestine Liberation Organization
should have a role has delayed the setting of a date.
   ``There are many other areas in the world clamoring for his
attention, areas where the circumstances are producing change,''
Tutwiler said. ``We hope to see the same kind of impulse that will
produce change in the Middle East and we're prepared to do all we
can to promote it.''
   Earlier, Baker talked on the telephone with Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens. On Monday he spoke with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid.
   ``We have continued to try to make progress and lay the basis
for a trilateral meeting,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``... If this effort
does fail, it certainly won't be due to a lack of effort or will on
the part of this president or this secretary of state.''
   On Monday, Baker expressed his frustration with the Middle East
to Kjell Magne Bondevik, the Norwegian foreign minister, in a
meeting at the State Department.
   Bondevik is chairman of the Christian People's Party, which
follows developments in the Middle East closely.
   At a news conference afterward, the Norwegian said Baker was
``not very optimistic'' about prospects for negotiations.
   After some arduous diplomacy, Baker last month won agreement in
principle from Egypt and Israel to send their foreign ministers
here to discuss prospects for elections among the 1.4 million
Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Both sides registered reservations, however, and a date for the
talks was not scheduled.
   Israel basically wants to prohibit the Palestine Liberation
Organization from influencing the elections. Egypt, on behalf of
the PLO, is trying to secure a behind-the-scenes role in the
negotiations for Yasser Arafat's organization.

<TEXT>
   The price of the Navy's new A-12 attack plane
totals about $100 million apiece, according to congressional
documents which inadvertently contained figures on the top secret
aircraft.
   ``The January 1989 budget included A-12 production through
fiscal year 1994 of 106 aircraft for $10.2 billion,'' said the
entry in the 888-page transcript of hearings held in 1989 by the
House Appropriations subcommittee on defense.
   The transcript's prior entries on the twin-engine, two-seat
fighter equipped with radar-evading stealth techonology deleted the
cost figures for the classified program. But in one category on
medium attack aircraft, the cost of producing the plane is simply
stated.
   Navy spokesman Lt. James Wood said Wednesday that the service
had no official comment on the transcript revelation, which was
originally reported in The Philadelphia Inquirer.
   The Navy plans to replace its aging fleet of A-6 planes with the
A-12. The A-6, however, cost considerably less _ about $20 million
each in 1986, prior to a halt in production.
   ``It is the Navy's desire that there will be no active
operational A-6E aircraft operating in fiscal year 2005,'' said the
newly released transcript. ``The president's budget includes A-12
procurement.''
   A Pentagon source, who spoke on condition he not be identified,
said the $100 million figure was inaccurate, citing the absence of
additional information on whether the cost of spare parts, training
and research and development was included in the total.
   The source said the Navy was disappointed with the ``editorial
error,'' but would ``deal with it as such.''
   The cost disclosure is expected to prompt criticism in Congress,
where initial calls have been for cuts in military spending in
light of a lessening Soviet threat.

   Rivers bloated by days of of heavy rain remained out of their
banks Wednesday in Washington state and an estimated 1,000 people
had been forced to flee, but high water in some Oregon communities
began receding.
   Rainfall eased during the morning, with the National Weather
Service predicting only scattered showers for the next couple of
days, after a series of windy storms that began Saturday. The wind
blew down thousands of trees, broke power lines and blew off roofs.
   Flooding in some areas of Washington was expected to continue
through the weekend.
   Three deaths were blamed on the storms in the Northwest, with a
body found floating Wednesday in a flooded area in Lewis County.
Two earlier deaths were reported in Oregon.
   The worst flooding in Washington was in Centralia, a town of
about 11,000 in southwestern Washington where as much as 4{ inches
of rain fell in 24 hours. Fire Chief Chuck Newbury said about 400
people were evacuated after a dike along the Skookumchuck River
failed during the night.
   Newbury said water in one neighborhood was 3 to 4 feet deep
Wednesday.
   ``The dike has been breached and they couldn't hold it back with
sandbags,'' Newbury said. ``It's just threatening property at the
moment. ... We don't foresee any life-threatening problems.''
   Officials also evacuated the Centralia Convalescent Center,
which has about 60 patients, because of flooding from the Chehalis
River. The Skookumchuck joins the Chehalis just outside town.
   Berg said he thought perhaps 2,000 people countywide might be
out of their homes, but that some may have just stayed away as a
precaution.
   Lewis County officials estimated about 30,000 sandbags had been
used to shore up riverbanks and protect buildings.
   Sheriff's Sgt. John McCroskey said Pe Ell, parts of Winlock and
other communities in western Lewis County were virtually
inaccessible by road.
   Elsewhere in Western Washington, officials evacuated 83
residents of a nursing home in McKenna, about 20 miles east of
Olympia; 16 families along the White River about 40 miles southeast
of Seattle; and about 100 people along the Nisqually River between
Olympia and Tacoma.
   Along the northern coast of Oregon, water was receding Wednesday
in Clatsop and Tillamook counties, where severe flooding prompted
the governor to declare a state of emergency Tuesday.
   In downtown Nehalem, a town of 240 people 25 miles north of
Tillamook, 2{ feet of water covered U.S. Highway 101 Tuesday, but
the water had dropped to less than a foot by late Wednesday
morning, city manager Merlin Brown said.
   ``It's more serious than we've had for a lot of years but not
total disaster by any means,'' he said.
   Clatsop County Sheriff John Raichl said flooding in the southern
part of his county was the worst in decades. Aat the height of the
flooding, water was 6 feet deep on some county roads.
   Businesses also were flooded along U.S. Highway 101 in north
Tillamook and in southern Clatsop County. A total of 37 people were
evacuated from homes in low-lying areas of southern Clatsop County
and along the lower Nehalem River in northern Tillamook County.
   ``Flooding is a perennial occurrence and people have become
complacent,'' said Paul Levesque, assistant director of emergency
services for Tillamook County.
   ``When they saw the need to leave, they no longer had the
capability. Their vehicles were under water and they couldn't leave
on foot,'' he said.
   Twenty-five people were evacuated from along the lower Nehalem
River, which crested nearly 12 feet above flood stage, the river's
highest level since records first were kept in 1971.
   Levesque said a mudslide had blocked the entrance of Cape
Lookout State Park southwest of Tillamook and probably wouldn't be
removed for at least a week.

<HEAD>Farmers Wait For Better Prices to Sell Their Livestock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RADZYMIN, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of Poland's little piggies finally
went to a free market, but their owners said they wished they'd
stayed home.
   Few private buyers were willing to pay what farmers were asking
for their pigs or calves Wednesday, but many farmers refused to
sell them to state slaughterhouses for less.
   ``It makes no sense to sell ... I haven't sold anything since
December,'' said Kurek Polikarp, a farmer from a nearby village,
who was asking 31 cents a pound for his two 3-week-old calves but
had hoped prices would hit 50 cents a pound at the market.
   The state, however, offered only 23 cents a pound for the
healthy 99-pound calves.
   The competitive market in Radzymin has been open since summer,
but Wednesday was the first time farmers have refused en masse to
sell. Many say they won't sell unless they can get a better price.
   Polikarp's beef with the prices is in part the result of a
radical economic reform program drawn up by the Solidarity-led
government.
   The plan aims to achieve a market-oriented economic system in a
country where prices were regulated and enterprises and agriculture
subsidized for decades.
   The previous Communist government freed almost all food prices
Aug. 1 in a first step toward free markets. The Solidarity-led
government freed the rest Jan. 1, when the price of gasoline and
electricity also rose.
   The new government also has scrapped a policy of paying
subsidies for agricultural products to try to make farmers more
efficient and fight inflation.
   Angry farmers are refusing to sell to the state slaughterhouses
because they say the prices wouldn't cover their mounting costs.
   The large state slaughterhouses supply a chain of state food
stores, and the increasing reluctance of farmers to sell has left
shelves bare despite the high prices.
   Gabriel Janowski, the new leader of private farmers' Solidarity
movement, has warned of unrest in the spring if the situation does
not imporove by then.
   ``It's pure robbery,'' said Stefan Wyszynski, when asked to
comment on the price that the state slaughterhouse was offering for
pigs.
   The Radzymin slaughterhouse, one of two operating at the market,
was offering to buy pigs at 30 cents a pound and the Zeran
slaughterhouse at 28 cents a pound, in contrast to the 31 cents per
pound price quoted on the free market.
   Farmers said none of those prices is enough to break even. They
say that for the sale of 220-pound pig they should be able to buy
2,200 pounds of feed but now they can only buy about 1,540 pounds.
   Those who who did sell said they had to in order to get cash.
Farmers are no longer eligible for cheap credits and must pay the
same 38 percent as other citizens on bank loans.
   ``I need the money so I have to sell,'' said Krzystyna
Dabrowska, the owner of a 6-month-old pig which she bought four
months ago and hoped to sell when it was 9 months old.
   Dabrowska has four pigs, four cows, chickens, ducks and geese on
her 12 acres farm. She said she wanted to sell the pig for cash to
buy feed for the other animals.
   The farmers seemed hopeful the government would achieve its goal
of stabilizing prices and bringing down the rate of inflation, but
they are determined not to sell at a loss.
   ``If I don't sell these pigs, I will take them home and wait
until there is a good price,'' said one young farmer, displaying
four healthy 9-month-old pigs.

   Each week since Hurricane Hugo smashed
into South Carolina, a plain envelope addressed in a child's hand
and usually containing $1 has arrived at the local American Red
Cross office.
   The envelopes apparently contain a portion of an unidentified
Pennsylvania youth's allowance, Red Cross Director Glenn Ellis said
Wednesday.
   Agency officials would like to thank the child for his or her
generosity _ which now amounts to about $17 _ but have no idea who
he or she may be, Ellis said.
   The only clue is a postmark of Rossiter, Pa., a community of
about 750 people located about 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.
   A $1 bill was enclosed in each of the envelopes except one which
contained 58 cents. The only writing on the envelope was the
address of the Red Cross office and the designation it was to be
used for Hugo relief.
   Red Cross officials plan to contact newspapers which serve the
Rossiter area in an attempt to try to find the youth.
   Meanwhile, although the Red Cross has stopped its fund raising
for Hugo relief, money continues to arrive each day.
   ``The most amazing thing is the kids,'' Ellis said, adding that
one child sent $1.25, saying he wanted to give his week's allowance
to the relief effort.
   In the days before Christmas the Red Cross got more offers of
toys and gifts than it could handle and had to ask other agencies
to handle the distribution.
   ``The generosity of the American people is just amazing,'' he
said. ``We still get money every day. We have stopped our fund
raising. But every day we still get checks.''
   Nationwide, more than $129 million was raised by the Red Cross
for hurricane and earthquake relief in the Caribbean, the U.S.
mainland and California. About $9.3 million of that has been spent
in South Carolina.
   Hurricane Hugo's 135 mph winds smashed into South Carolina on
Sept. 21, causing an estimated $6 billion damage and claiming 29
lives.

<HEAD>Brooks Wants Bush To Fill Vacant Federal Judgeships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee
warned Wednesday that the White House is so far behind in
appointing judges it jeopardizes the work of the federal courts.
   ``Unless timely action is taken, our judicial system will grind
to a virtual standstill under this staggering workload, thereby
undermining the valiant efforts of our law enforcement officials to
bring drug criminals to justice,'' Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, wrote
to President Bush.
   Brooks said he would consider expanding federal resources for
the federal judiciary, but the question of judicial vacancies must
first be addressed.
   According to Brooks, there are 59 federal court vacancies _ 18
at the Appeals Court level and 41 at the District Court level. At
the same time, only eight nominations are pending before the Senate
to fill those openings.
   ``Whatever the cause for inaction, I would strongly urge you to
move to fill the existing vacancies without delay,'' Brooks told
Bush.
   The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, meanwhile, is
recommending the creation of 75 new federal judgeships nationwide.
   Brooks told Bush he stands ready to ``give serious consideration
to the expansion of resources for the federal judiciary, if
warranted, but that decision awaits movement to fill existing
vacancies.''
   Average caseloads for District Court judges have increased 53
percent in the past 20 years, while appeals court judges have seen
average caseloads grow more than 100 percent, Brooks said.
   Given that ``astonishing growth,'' he said, ``this large number
of empty slots and the slowness of the nominating process is all
the more distressing. Moreover, the war on drugs has placed, and
will continue to exert, a particularly heavy burden on the system.''
   Brooks said drug cases now represent as much as 60 percent of
new criminal filings in some districts, and that the problem is
``particuarly acute'' in border states like Texas, where heavy
illegal drug activity is reported along the Rio Grande.

   Vice President Dan Quayle hinted Wednesday
that NASA may lose its monopoly on American space exploration, with
the government turning to a program that could include commercial
and defense elements.
   Quayle, speaking at a meeting of the American Astronomical
Society, said he has been told by space experts that changes are
needed in how the United States conducts its space exploration.
   The vice president, who is chairman of the National Space
Council, said the organization ``is looking across the traditional
divisions among civil, commercial and national security
activities'' in reassessing the American space program.
   ``We are building a program that is more than the sum of these
parts,'' said Quayle.
   Quayle gave no specific details how the national space effort
might be split between various agencies.
   But a source at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said that some in the agency have interpreted his
remarks as suggesting that some other agencies may assume a larger
role in the U.S. space program. The source said such a division of
efforts have been discussed within the agency.
   Quayle said President Bush has asked the space council ``that we
shape a space program that is aggressive and innovative and that we
challenge accepted ways of doing business.''
   Quayle said he has met with groups of space experts and ``I
heard much the same thing from almost all of them. They told me
that we simply can no longer accept the status quo. I agree.''
   As chairman of the National Space Council, Quayle said, ``I
intend to bring the kind of innovative approaches to the space
program of the '90s that were characteristic of Polaris, Atlas,
Apollo, Voyager and some programs in the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency.''
   Quayle said that a major effort of a revamped space program
would be development of expanded space launch capabilities. Systems
to launch into space, he said, ``are as vital to space travel as
the interstate highway system is to motor travel.''
   Launch systems, he said, ``cannot be considered only within the
context of a single government agency. They cannot be built to meet
the needs only of a specific space program. They must be structured
to accommodate both current needs and future programs.''
   One of the most serious effects of the 1986 Challenger explosion
that grounded the space shuttle fleet was that it virtually left
America without a way to launch large satellites. The shuttle had
been developed with the promise that it would serve all of the
nation's space launch needs.
   Quayle reaffirmed Bush administration support for plans to
return humans to the moon and eventually send astronauts to Mars.
   But the vice president said the U.S. space effort will continue
to include unmanned space probes, such as the Voyager craft that
recently completed a fly-by exploration of the planet Neptune.
   ``That mission taught all of us how central unmanned exploration
is to space science and discovery,'' he said. ``Let me reaffirm our
commitment to the unmanned, as well as the manned, exploration of
space.''
   Quayle pledged that the moon and Mars exploration ``will not
emphasize human activities at the expense of scientific
excellence.''
   He said the moon exploration will include establishing permanent
astronomical observatories on the lunar surface.
   A NASA source said that some have suggested within the agency
that observatories on the moon could be operated by other agencies,
such as the National Science Foundation or one of the federal
laboratories.
   Quayle said he has asked the National Academy of Sciences and
the Aerospace Industries Association to look at the current space
program ``and tell us about new, better approaches.''
   An audience of astronomers repeatedly applauded Quayle's remarks
about supporting unmanned space exploration. Many astronomers have
complained in the past that the expense of sending astronauts into
space has taken away funds from building and launching cheaper,
unmanned space probes.
   John Bacall, president-elect of the AAS, said Quayle's speech
suggests that the Bush administration ``understands the
importance'' of unmanned science probes in space.
   American astronomers, he said, ``have to come to grip with the
possibility of there being facilities on the moon and Mars and what
we can best do with them.''

<HEAD>Mexican Government Complains Over `Drug Wars' TV Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico complained Wednesday that NBC News
interviews following segments of the ``Drug Wars'' television
miniseries unfairly gave the impression that the Mexican government
is corrupt and involved in drug smuggling.
   An NBC News official replied that the embassy had declined the
opportunity to have a Mexican representative interviewed on the
program but said that the program nonetheless gave the point of
view of the Mexican government as well as of its critics.
   ``Drug Wars,'' a three-part miniseries produced by NBC's
entertainment division, dealt with the 1985 killing of U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent Enrique Camarena.
   After each of the episodes, which were broadcast Sunday through
Tuesday nights, NBC News presented a 15-minute interview segment.
The segments were taped Sunday at the DEA laboratory in Washington.
   Embassy spokesman Javier Treveino said at a news conference that
``some assertions made by the interviewer, reporter and guests are
the product of sheer ignorance, imprecise, unfair, lacking of any
evidence, and, maybe, in bad faith.''
   Lloyd Siegel, executive producer for special broadcasts at NBC
News, said the network took pains to see that Mexico's point of
view was represented and ``we do not accept the charge that there
were any inaccuracies or inconsistencies'' in its reporting.
   Siegel said NBC even sent a vice president of news, Gordon
Manning, to the embassy in an effort to persuade officials there to
provide a representative to be interviewed.
   ``They did not see their way clear to doing that,'' he said.
``What they did, however, is to recommend an expert, someone to
represent their views, and we included him.''
   The news executive said the expert, Guido Belsasso of the
University of California at San Diego, `very forthrightly and
clearly stated that there had been great progress in terms of drug
enforcement in Mexico and efforts to root out corruption in the
Mexican government.''
   He said this view was echoed by federal drug policy director
William Bennett and by Drug Enforcement Administrator John C. Lawn
on the other two nights, and ``we are somewhat puzzled by the
position they (Mexican officials) are taking now.''
   Gustavo Gonzalez, legal adviser to the embassy, said Mexican
officials declined to be interviewed partly because they were
apprehensive that any statements they made could be used by
attorneys representing the men charged with Camarena's murder.
   Camarena, 37, was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara,
Mexico. His Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avalar, was kidnapped a
few days later. Their bullet-riddled bodies, showing signs of
torture, were found March 5, 1985, wrapped in plastic bags and
buried in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of
Guadalajara.
   Rafael Caro Quintero, 37; Ernesto Rafael Fonseca Carillo, 56;
and 10 other men have been prosecuted and sentenced in Mexico for
the killings.
   Treveino said the killings were ``the criminal action of drug
traffickers whose interests were being seriously affected'' and
were ``by no means imputable to the Mexican government.''
   ``We categorically deny statements, lacking of any evidence,
that top Mexican officials are involved in drug trafficking, and
that corrupion goes to the highest level of the Mexican
government,'' the embassy spokesman said.
   He took exception to a statement by Brian Ross, an NBC reporter
who appeared on the program, quoting U.S. authorities as saying
that ``Mexico is just like Panama in that drug corruption is deep
and pervasive, and that almost in every part of the country there
is a local Noriega, a comandante, a general, a governor getting
rich by dealing with Colombian cartel drug bosses to bring cocaine
to the U.S. through Mexico.''
   Treveino said this assertion ``is not only irresponsible and
malign, but it also deeply hurts the Mexican people and
institutions that are courageously fighting drugs every day.''
   Siegel said, ``Based on Brian's long experience and active
coverage of this area, obviously we stand by his report.''

<TEXT>
   The 10-nation Communist trading bloc
Comecon agreed on Wednesday that the system was outdated and needed
a complete overhaul.
   But Soviets and the more radical Eastern Europeans remained
split at the end of the two-day Comecon summit over how far and how
fast reforms should go.
   Delegates apparently compromised on a Soviet proposal Tuesday
that all Comecon trade by 1991 should be done at world market
prices and in hard currency.
   The Eastern Europeans, long dependent on Soviet fuel and energy
supplies, claimed such a fast liberalization would be disastrous
for their economies, already strapped for hard currency.
   The delegations said in a final statement that their 45th
session ``underlined the necessity for decisive renovation of the
whole system of mutual cooperation'' within the Council for Mutual
Economic Assistance _ as Comecon is formally known.
   The statement also called for ``radical restructuring of the
activities of the Council, a re-examination of its functions and
aims, (and) ... a new statute suitable to current and long-term
requirements'' of member nations.
   ``A 40-year period is coming to an end,'' Bulgarian Premier
Georgi Atanassov said at the closing session. ``This meeting marks
a real new start ... with new rules of the game.''
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, who held separate talks with
several new Eastern European prime ministers while in Sofia, told
reporters Moscow was satisfied with the outcome.
   ``The Soviet Union is happy with the meeting because it means
Comecon has a future,'' he said.
   Officials indicated, however, that most Comecon trade in the
future would be on a bilateral basis, diminishing Soviet dominance
as Eastern Europeans abandon centralized, five-year plans that were
the bulwark of four decades of Stalinist economic management.
   A gradual switch to world market prices on a hard currency basis
will take place within the bloc, which cut itself off from most
other global commerce since its founding in 1949.
   Delegates agreed to set up a commission to discuss the changes
and work out ``in the shortest possible time drafts for new basic
documents of Comecon,'' the statement said.
   Hungary's deputy premier, Peter Medgyessy, told The Associated
Press details will be decided by a workin commission that will
report to Comecon's Moscow-based headquarters and then to the
bloc's next summit in Budapest.
   A Bulgarian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he thought it would take three to five years to move from current
trading practices, based on barter, and artificial currency exhange
rates.
   ``We went for a soft-landing scenario,'' he said, indicating the
Soviets agreed to phase in the transition.
   But the lack of details in the statement reflected apparent
discord among members over when and how reforms should be put into
effect.
   Delegates from more reform-minded members, such as
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, were clearly pushing for
swifter action Wednesday.
   ``It doesn't take an Einstein to figure out what's wrong with
Comecon,'' said Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's outspoken finance
minister and an advocate of free-market policies.
   ``We don't want to pay for new commissions to make more nice
blueprints. we want to go ahead ... by trial and error if
necessary.''
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland said later, ``I will
be satisfied if radical reforms come into effect,'' adding that
depended on each country's success with internal reforms and
overall East-West integration in Europe.
   A Czechoslovak official, who also demanded anonymity, said
Prague's suggestion was rebuffed that an extraordinary plenary
meeting take place as early as March to discuss commission findings.
   He said a summit before June was sought to try to avoid chaos in
the bloc, with Poles, Czechs and Hungarians possibly trading
bilaterally in hard currencies while other members still used fixed
rates.
   Warsaw and Prague have already said they will begin trading in
hard currencies and will link their own currencies in a direct
rate, bypassing the ruble _ Comecon's non-convertible accounting
unit.
   Comecon finance ministers will meet next Tuesday through
Thursday in Prague for further discussion, Klaus said.
   He said he saw a future Comecon as a loose, ``umbrella
organization'' for trade agreements that could be signed by ``a
few, some or all members.''
   Hungary has already broken with one Comecon key practice, which
assigned production of certain goods to individual countries, by
signing an agreement with Japan's Suzuki Co. to manufacture cars
for sale at home and abroad.
   In Comecon previously, only East Germany, Romania, the Soviet
Union and Czechoslovakia were allowed to build cars.
   The organization includes the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Vietnam, Mongolia
and Cuba.

   A woman serving a life sentence for
killing a man is seeking a new trial, claiming her abusive husband
forced her to admit to a crime he committed.
   Ann McMaugh, 33, and her husband, Bernard, 43, are serving life
sentences for the 1980 shooting death of Gregory J. Dube in nearby
Smithfield.
   Mrs. McMaugh had said she shot Dube as she tried to throw her
husband's pistol into the back seat of their car while her husband
and Dube were fighting.
   But now she says she had nothing to do with the shooting and is
seeking a new trial on the murder charge.
   At a hearing Monday, a psychologist said Mrs. McMaugh's claim is
possible because some abused women feel they have no chance of
reversing their lot in life.
   Mrs. McMaugh suffered from battered women's symdrome at the time
she said she was forced to lie about a slaying her husband
committed, testified Angela Brown, an expert in domestic violence.
   The hearing resumes Jan. 17.
   Ms. Brown, who wrote ``When Battered Women Kill,'' said she
interviewed Mrs. McMaugh for 21 hours from December 1987 through
August.
   Ms. Brown said Mrs. McMaugh told her McMaugh often placed a gun
between them while they slept in their nearby Central Falls home
and that her husband often choked her, punched her, flung her
around by her hair and forced her to have sex with others.
   Within minutes of the shooting, a policeman stopped the
McMaugh's car and was told by McMaugh, ``You're looking for me. I
just shot someone.'' The policeman said he saw two guns on the
console with the barrels facing Mrs. McMaugh, who was hysterical,
in the passenger seat.
   Ms. Brown testified that after the shooting, McMaugh ``began
rehearsing the incident'' with his wife and forced her to agree
with ``his version of the events.'' what was his version.
   McMaugh was indicted in the killing, but two years later Mrs.
McMaugh came forward and said she accidently killed Dube. They both
stood trial and were convicted of murder.
   During the trial, two witnesses said McMaugh fired the fatal
shot from the driver's seat and forensic experts said the shot was
fired about 12 inches from Dube's head.
   Richard Gelles, a dean at the University of Rhode Island who has
written books on family violence and child abuse, said ``it's
pretty likely'' the scenario described Mrs. McMaugh and Ms. Brown
is true. Gelles is not involved in the case.
   ``Thirteen percent of battered women feel things are completely
hopeless. It's perfectly reasonable that they would do anything
their batterer told them to do,'' Gelles said. ``If he told them
the sky was green, they would doubt their own senses.''

   Justice Department officials are concerned
over the prospect of Miami's flamboyant U.S. attorney heading the
prosecution team at Manuel Noriega's drug trial, sources said
Wednesday.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, who has not tried a case in a
decade, has said through spokeswoman Diane Cossin that he plans to
be the lead prosecutor of the deposed Panamanian dictator.
   Known for his temper and theatrics, which included using a
plastic AK-47 rifle as a prop during a pep talk on the drug war,
Lehtinen has appeared at court proceedings in the case since
Noriega was brought to Miami.
   But Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Thursday that
no decision has been made on the makeup of the prosecution team.
``There will be discussions between people here and Mr. Lehtinen
and his staff,'' he said.
   Normally, the Justice Department is loathe to tell a U.S.
attorney who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the
Senate how to conduct a case under his jurisdiction.
   But Lehtinen is a court-appointed acting U.S. attorney whose
appointment to a full four-year term is now under review at the
White House.
   An administration source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Justice Department is concerned that Lehtinen would not be
able to both run a large U.S. attorney's office and personally
conduct a complex criminal case expected to run more than a year.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh may ask Lehtinen to choose
between being U.S. attorney and heading the Noriega trial team,
said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Myles Malman, who has also represented
the government in the case, is the likely head of the trial team,
said the source.
   Lehtinen's reputation for having a temper is known to
Thornburgh's advisers, said another source, who also spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   In response to questions about Lehtinen's role in the case,
Cossin said:
   ``We do not comment on rank speculation. I can assure you that
the prosecution team has not been announced. What has happened is
that both Mr. Lehtinen and Mr. Malman have appeared numerous times
on behalf of the government in the case.''
   The statement contrasted with her previous assertions that
Lehtinen would be the lead prosecutor in the case.
   Lehtinen, whose wife, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, was recently elected
to the House seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Claude Pepper,
D-Fla., is politically well connected with the Bush family.
   Both Bush and Jeb Bush, the president's son, campaigned for Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen during her successful bid to win Pepper's seat in a
special election.
   Lehtinen, 43, is known among Justice Department officials and
Miami lawyers for his temper and flamboyant behavior.
   He once appeared at a staff meeting waving a plastic AK-47 rifle
to demonstate his commitment to the war on drugs, according to
published reports confirmed by a former senior prosecutor in the
office.
   Many career prosecutors have been alienated by the
military-style chain of command that Lehtinen imposed on the
office, former prosecutors say.
   ``Essentially he treats everybody like infantry,'' says one
former prosecutor, who now practices law in Miami. ``They're just
some very talented people treated like infantry.''
   Last summer, Lehtinen was roundly rebuked by a federal judge for
trying to prosecute an art collector on charges of violating the
1963 Trading with the Enemy Act for selling the work of Cuban
artists.
   ``I find it somewhat unusual that the U.S. attorney has
announced publicly he's not going to prosecute less than five
kilograms of cocaine... and then expends his resources going after
paintings,'' said U.S. District Judge Kenneth Ryskamp, who
dismissed the charges and ordered the return of 219 seized
paintings.
   Lehtinen has also feuded with Richard D. Gregorie, the former
assistant U.S. attorney who obtained the Noriega indictment in 1988.
   Lehtinen has refused Gregorie's offer of help on the case, which
former prosecutors say is an imprudent move.
   The insight and advice of the prosecutor who developed witnesses
and presented the evidence to the grand jury is invaluable in a
complex criminal case, say former prosecutors.
   ``It's not that you can't do without the former prosecutor, it's
just not wise,'' said one former prosecutor. ``It's like taking the
bar examination without having the review course. You could do it,
it's not smart.''

<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
said Wednesday he is ready to meet with his North Korean
counterpart Kim Il Sung to discuss free travel between the two
Koreas.
   ``Gone are the days when North Korea was our rival,'' Roh said
at a New Year's news conference televised live nationwide.
   He made the remarks in response to a proposal by Kim in his New
Year's address that free travel be allowed across the heavily
fortified Korean border on the condition that South Korea destroy a
concrete wall on its side of the Demilitarized Zone, which
separates the two countries.
   ``I welcome the proposal of the top North Korean leader ... for
free travel and total opening between the South and the North, even
though hard-to-understand preconditions were attached to it,'' Roh
said.
   South Korean officials had said Kim's reference to the alleged
``concrete wall'' in the South was merely propaganda, aimed at
giving the false impression that there is a barrier like the Berlin
wall on the Korean peninsula.
   ``There simply is no such wall in the South,'' the South Korean
Defense Ministry said in a statement.
   Roh said Wednesday he wants to meet Kim to discuss free travel
and other tension-easing measures on the peninsula, which was
divided into the capitalist South and the communist North in 1945.
The two Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950s.
   ``I reaffirm my conviction that a South-North summit should be
held as quickly as possible to that end,'' Roh said. ``I once again
urge North Korea to positively respond to this.''
   Roh's previous calls for a South-North summit have gone unheeded.
   He said his country hopes to conclude a travel and communication
agreement with the North.
   Roh, praising recent sweeping reform in East Europe, said he
hoped similar changes would happen on the Korean peninsula. He
noted that no mail, telephone calls or visits are allowed between
the two Koreas.
   ``If it takes time for the two parts of Korea to agree to free
travel and full opening, then exchanges of corredpondence and
telephone calls and free home visits by dispersed relatives should
be implemented,'' he said.
   A proposed family exchange, the second since the division of the
Korean peninsula four decades ago, fell apart last month after
North Korea insisted on staging a revolutionary opera live on South
Korean television.
   The two Koreas have held talks on and off since the early 1970s
but have made little progress on personnel, parliamentary and
cultural exchanges. Each side tends to distrust the other's
proposals.
   The Korean border is one of the most heavily fortified in the
world, guarded by about 1.5 million troops on both sides. The two
Koreas technically are still at war because no peace treaty was
signed.
   Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo said in an interview Wednesday
with the state-run broadcasting network, KBS, that South Korea
would move its troops down from the border if North Korea took
similar measures.
   During the nearly three-hour news conference, Roh also said
South Korea and the United States have decided to scale back this
year's joint ``Team Spirit'' military exercises to help ease
tension on the peninsula.
   U.S. and South Korean officials announced Wednesday this year's
exercises, an annual event since 1976, will be held for two weeks
starting March 14 in various parts of South Korea.
   U.S. military spokesman Bill Fullerton said this year's
exercises would involve ``fewer troops and weapons'' but did not
say the extent of the scaleback. Last year's exercises involved
200,000 soldiers from both sides.
   Despite Roh's assurances that the scaleback was intended to
promote inter-Korea dialogue and ease tension, it was unclear
whether North Korea would welcome it. In past years, the North
boycotted all talks with South Korea to protest the military
maneuvers.

<HEAD>Cold Front Brings High Wind, High Temps To North-Central States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Strong southerly wind whipped across the western Plains on
Wednesday, driving temperatures to record highs with readings in
the 60s as far north as South Dakota.
   The Pacific cold front which brought heavy rain and high wind to
the Northwest on Tuesday produced the blustery weather.
   High wind warnings were issued for the eastern half of Montana,
the northern mountains and eastern sections of Wyoming, the western
Dakotas and the eastern foothills of Colorado.
   Wind gusts during the morning included 70 mph at Cody, Wyo., 67
mph at Boulder, Colo., and 65 mph at Dickinson and Williston, N.D.
   It was the third straight day of high wind in Wyoming. Since
beginning Sunday, gales have derailed a freight train, ripped a
hole in a Cheyenne high school gymnasium, and peeled roofs from
mobile homes.
   Flooding continued in parts of Oregon and Washington state
because of the heavy rain dumped Tuesday and during previous storms
over the weekend. Seaside, Ore., got 6.5 inches of rain Tuesday,
with unofficial reports ion the area ranging up to 8.16 inches, the
National Weather Service said.
   Widely scattered showers lingered in the northern Pacific Coast
region Wednesday.
   The strong southerly wind blowing ahead of the Pacific cold
front pushed temperatures into the 60s as far north as South
Dakota, and into the 70s as far north as Nebraska and eastern
Colorado.
   Temperatures across parts of the central part of the nation were
more than 30 degrees above normal for this time of the year, with
the middle Missouri Valley warmer than the Gulf Coast.
   Record highs were 55 at Aberdeen, S.D.; 54 at Bismarck, N.D.; 69
at Brighton, Colo.; 58 at Casper, Wyo.; 66 at Colorado Springs,
Colo.; 71 at Denver; 53 at Devils Lake, N.D.; 50 at Dickinson,
N.D.; 45 at Fargo, N.D.; 49 at Glasgow, Mont.; 74 at Goodland,
Kan.; 76 at Grand Island, Neb.; 53 at Jamestown, N.D.; 65 at
Milford, Utah; 50 at Minot, N.D.; 69 at Norfolk, Neb.; 72 at North
Platte, Neb.; 75 at Oklahoma City; 66 at Richfield, Utah; 76 at
Wichita Falls, Texas, and 44 at Williston, N.D.
   The records at Devils Lake, Grand Island and North Platte also
were records for the entire month of January.
   Fort Smith, Ark., tied its record of 74, which has been on the
books since 1890.
   ``We're having a pretty good day,'' said Matt Bittinger of the
Willis Case Golf Course at Denver. About 150 to 200 golfers were on
the course Wednesday, compared with about 100 on an average January
day. ``We've seen a few wearing shorts.''
   Elsewhere, rain and snow showers were scattered from New England
to the middle Atlantic Coast region and the upper Ohio Valley.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 3 degrees below zero
at International Falls, Minn.

<HEAD>Administration Contends Further Nicaraguan Election Interference</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration objects to what it
sees as interference with its Nicaraguan electoral assistance but
has no plans to use a Panama precedent and invade Nicaragua, the
White House said Wednesday.
   Part of President Bush's justification for the Dec. 20 invasion
of Panama was the U.S. contention that elections there last May
were stolen by now-deposed ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega. U.S.
troops installed President Guillermo Endara, who independent
observers had said was the winner of that election.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said Wednesday that ``there
are no plans to invade Nicaragua,'' despite a suggestion by Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole that Managua should look carefully at what
happened in Panama.
   Nicaragua has elections scheduled for Feb. 25. Bush
administration officials have been critical of the preparations,
accusing the Sandinista government of harassing and stacking the
election deck against the opposition.
   In addition, Popadiuk said it was ``troublesome'' that some of
the $9 million the United States has sent to assist the Nicaraguan
opposition has been held up in banking bureaucracy and red tape.
   Dole said last week that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and
Cuban President Fidel Castro perhaps would ``get the message that
people will only be oppressed for so long, whether it's in Eastern
Europe or Central America or wherever.''
   ``I think Ortega will understand now that it's probably in his
interest to have free and fair elections in February,'' Dole said.
   Asked about Dole's comments, Popadiuk said, ``There is an
election process under way. We expect free and fair elections to
take place.''
   However, he added, ``We've noticed that the Nicaraguans have
been harassing the opposition to a great extent, all of which is
counterproductive to an election process going forward smoothly.
This is something that troubles us.''
   Bush has stated that the circumstances of Nicaragua are much
different from Panama, where Noriega was wanted on a U.S. drug
trafficking indictment and where the United States had substantial
Panama Canal-related interests.
   Regarding impediments to the flow of the U.S. electoral aid,
State Department officials said Wednesday there were indications
the obstacles were being removed, and the money would be received
by the civic election monitoring group IPCE.
   Later, however, another official said although Nicaraguan Vice
President Sergio Ramirez promised to eliminate the problems, IPCE
officials were told Wednesday they still were not properly
registered in Nicaragua and it would take six months to file the
paperwork.
   The $1.5 million designated by the United States for IPCE _ the
letters represent a Spanish acronym _ had been held up since early
December, one source said.
   Further delay in releasing the money will be seen as a
deliberate roadblock by Managua, rather than just red tape, said
one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The political opposition party UNO, for National Opposition
Union, when unable to have its funds wired to the Central Bank
ultimately began purchasing vehicles and materials it needed and
arranging for the vendors to be paid from foreign banks, said the
official.
   Bush telephoned UNO`s presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro on
Wednesday to inquire about her health and discuss the election,
Popadiuk said. She is being treated in Houston for a knee ailment,
he said.
   Congress approved the $9 million in electoral aid to be
administered through the quasi-governmental National Endowment for
Democracy. IPCE is to spend its $1.5 million for such activities as
supporting poll watchers and checking voter registration lists.
   UNO was to receive $1.8 million for such political activity as
voter registration and organization. Under Nicaraguan election law,
50 percent of any foreign contribution to the election process
would must go to the country's Supreme Electoral Council, thereby
also benefiting the government.
   The rest of the funds were designated for other observer groups
and to administrative and auditing costs, including those of the
National Endowment and the State Department's Agency for
International Development.

<TEXT>
   The month Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
was indicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges, he received an
outpouring of support from around the world, according to documents
recently uncovered.
   Political maverick Lyndon Larouche was one of Noreiga's
well-wishers, apologizing for the actions of the U.S. government.
   A person who called himself a ``real American'' said he was glad
there was someone like Noriega unafraid to fight ``the communist
buildup in Nicaragua.''
   And an ``international virgin'' talked of bringing paradise down
to earth.
   Those were a few of the congratulatory telexes Noriega received
in February 1988, shortly after he was indicted on drug smuggling
and money laundering charges by a federal grand jury in Florida.
   According to copies of the telexes obtained by The Associated
Press, the former dictator had backing from his diplomats, his
Defense Forces and many foreigners and organizations.
   ``I extend to you my apologies for what the government of the
United States is doing to the Republic of Panama,'' wrote Larouche
in a telex dated Feb. 28, 1988. Larouche was then running for
president as a Democrat.
   ``I reiterate to you what I have stated publicly. That the
Reagan administration current policies towards Panama are
absolutely an offense to your nation and all of Latin America,''
said Larouche.
   LaRouche was convicted on Dec. 16, 1988, of conspiracy to commit
mail fraud involving more than $30 million in defaulted loans, 11
counts of actual mail fraud involving $294,000 and conspiring to
defraud the Internal Revenue Service. He is serving a 15-year
prison term.
   His telex was one of dozens bound under the title ``Cables and
Telexes. Received Feb. 1988.''
   One sent Feb. 29 was signed by a ``Real American'' from Council
Bluffs, Iowa.
   ``Our self-serving Congress hasn't the guts to prevent the
communist buildup in Nicaragua, so it is left to individuals like
yourself. ... That's what they are mad about,'' it said.
   Noriega was indicted on Feb. 4, 1988. He has claimed the United
States began a campaign against him after he refused to help
U.S.-funded Contra guerrillas fight Nicaragua's Sandinista
government, which is leftist but denies it is communist.
   Then-Panamanian President Eric Delvalle tried to dismiss Noriega
as commander of the armed forces. But Noriega outmaneuvered
Delvalle, and it was the president himself who was out of a job.
   The outcome earned Noriega plenty of cheers.
   A Swedish anti-drug organization based in Stockholm telexed
Noriega and offered him ``Congratulations. We stand behind you and
the real fight against drugs.''
   A telex dated Feb. 26 and signed by an ``American citizen and
patriot'' in Stockholm said:``You are right and they are wrong.
Indict Elliot Abrams (then in charge of Latin American affairs at
the State Department). Escalate the fight against injustice.''
   There were only a handful of critical messages: ``Noriega's days
are numbered,'' warned one unsigned telex dated Feb. 29.
   The Inter American Press Association and the Paris-based
International Federation of Newspaper Publishers sent telexes
strongly protesting the closure of dailies critical of Noriega.
   But mostly Noriega had support.
   ``My general, as long as there is a uniform and a weapon, you
have in this citizen a soldier ready to fight,'' wrote one civilian.
   One of Noriega's captains vowed: ``General, we are united with
you. Not one step back.''
   There were also many civilians from Latin American countries
expressing solidarity. Wrote one Honduran: ``Don't let Panama be
another Grenada,'' a reference to the 1983 U.S. invasion of the
Caribbean island.
   Noriega also got a small portion of unsolicited advice. One
person signing off as ``The international virgin'' said:
   ``What is the meaning of life? Answer: To bring down the
paradise to earth.''

<HEAD>Latest Rash of Kidnappings include Congressman, Merchant,
Cattleman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Armed men abducted a Colombian
congressman, a cattleman and a wealthy merchant in separate
incidents Wednesday, authorities said.
   The three victims brought to 430 the number of people held by
kidnappers in Colombia, according to police statistics.
   Mario Silgado Romero, a 60-year-old Liberal Party congressman
from Sucre state, was abducted Wednesday in the northwestern city
of Sincelejo, a police communique said.
   About 15 armed men, apparently belonging to a leftist guerrilla
group the People's Liberation Army, stopped the congressman's car,
pulled him from the driver's seat and forced him into another
vehicle, said the communique, read by two national radio networks.
   Police said another guerrilla group, the National Liberation
Army, kidnapped a cattle rancher, Luis Mantilla, at his ranch near
the town of Rio de Oro in northern Cesar state.
   In Medellin, unidentified armed men kidnapped a merchant, Mario
Ospina, after stopping the car in which he and his wife were
traveling, police said. The men forced Ospina into another car and
disappeared, their communique said.
   It was not known whether leftist guerrillas or common criminals
were behind the Ospina abduction.
   Earlier this week, a state official for the cattle raisers'
association, known as Fedegan, was kidnapped near Popayan, 223
miles southwest of Bogota.
   The abduction of the official, Luis Fernando Caicedo, prompted
Fedegan to release a communique stating that 225 ranchers were
being held by kidnappers. The communique said that 35 of the
kidnappings had occurred in November and December.
   Neither Fedegan nor police mentioned whether a ransom was being
demanded in exchange for release of the recent victims.
   The Medellin cartel has kidnapped at least 20 people, many of
them members of Colombia's richest families, in recent months,
according to the secret police. Fedegan did not say whether any of
the kidnapped ranchers are among the cartel's victims.
   Earlier this week the cartel issued a communique saying that if
police did not release four jailed cartel members by Jan. 13, the
traffickers would kill one of their hostages, the son of a
presidential adviser.
   Police say they have never heard of the four jailed persons
mentioned in the communique.
   Fedegan said 150 of the 225 kidnapped cattle ranchers are being
held by leftist guerrillas. The country's rebel groups, responsible
for scores of abductions in recent years, frequently either
exchange the hostages for ransom or use them to send messages to
the government.

<HEAD>Silence After Secret Talks on Flight 103 Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators and government
officials from five countries conferred in secret Wednesday to
assess progress in the hunt for the bombers of Pan Am Flight 103.
   But the officials refused any comment following the seven-hour
meeting in Lockerbie, the small Scottish town devastated by the
crash of the airliner a year ago.
   The Dec. 21, 1988, bombing killed all 259 people on board the
jetliner flying from London to New York, as well as 11 people on
the ground.
   Wednesday's meeting was the fifth in a series attended by
investigators from the United States, Britain, West Germany, Sweden
and Malta.
   At the police incident center in Lockerbie, set up to control
the bombing investigation, a police officer said: ``No statement
has been issued and I do not anticipate that any will be made.''
   Security was tight at the hotel where the conference took place,
with police and dogs posted at the grounds and more police inside
the building.
   Observers speculated that the investigators were discussing
possible legal moves against a Palestinian, Mohammed Abu Talb, 35,
who was jailed for life in Sweden last month for bombings in
northern Europe in 1985.
   Abu Talb was discovered to have visited Malta about the time the
bomb may have been prepared and the weapon was reportedly wrapped
in clothing from Malta.
   Talb's Swedish attorney said at the time of the trial that his
client denied involvement in the Flight 103 bombing and said his
trip to Malta was an unrelated business visit.
   Among the 30 people taking part in the conference were
representatives of Lord Fraser, the Lord Advocate, who as
Scotland's chief law officer would be in charge of any prosecution.
   Previous meetings took place in Lockerbie, Washington, London
and Meckenheim, West Germany. Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt,
changing planes at London's Heathrow Airport.
   In a related development, British Transport Secretary Cecil
Parkinson told the House of Commons in London Wednesday that there
had been 460 hoax bomb warnings to British airports and airlines
last year.
   ``It is a sad reflection on the sick minds of these people that
the number has increased substantially since Lockerbie,'' Parkinson
said.
   He said the British side of the investigation has so far cost
$11.6 million and that police in Dumfries and Galloway, the region
where the plane was blown up, have taken more than 14,000
statements and more than 35,000 photographs, and recorded about
16,000 items of property in the debris.
   Parkinson said measures had been taken since the bombing to
tighten security at airports, and he said he would be in Washington
Thursday for further talks on security with U.S. Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   Parkinson was speaking during a debate on the Aviation and
Maritime Security Bill to strengthen safeguards against terrorism.
The bill would mean stronger checks of all people working in
aircraft and airports, including firms doing maintenance, cleaning
and catering.

   Authorities called in the army to
quell a prison riot by enraged inmates who said they should benefit
from an amnesty decreed by the National Salvation Front, the state
Rompres news agency reported Wednesday.
   Interior Minister Col. Gen. Mihai Ghitac said rioting flared
Tuesday at Jilava prison near Bucharest but calm was restored
``with the help of the army'' and prisoners were back in their
cells.
   The report said 20 of the ``most dangerous convicts'' forced
others to join them. The overall number of rioters was not given.
   Convicts wielding iron bars broke down cell doors and barricaded
themselves inside a room, Rompres said. They said the amnesty
offered after dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown and
executed last month should be extended to them and they should go
free.
   Some of their families, most of them Gypsies, gathered outside
the prison with the same demand.
   Inside the prison, ``warning shots were fired and water hoses
used to calm them down,'' Rompres said, adding that no casualties
resulted.
   Army units surrounded the prison Tuesday and soldiers took over
guarding inmates, Rompres said. At least some units were withdrawn
Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, streetcar drivers on at least eight lines went
on strike in Bucharest, complaining that people angry about system
shortcomings were taking it out on them.
   They also complained about working conditions and pay, Rompres
said.
   Scores of streetcars did not operate.
   A public transport company spokesman told Rompres people could
not understand the deficiencies were caused by cutbacks imposed
under Ceausescu.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered top
Pentagon officials to review strategy and some major weapons
programs in light of expected tight budgets and liberalization in
Eastern Europe, Defense Department sources said Wednesday.
   Paul Wolfowitz, undersecretary of defense for policy, will
direct the reassessment of overall strategy, while John Betti,
undersecretary for acquisition, has been asked to review the
Pentagon's most expensive aircraft projects, the sources said.
   ``In part, it's because of what's happening in Eastern Europe,''
said one Pentagon official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified by name.
   The official said that while such studies are usually under way
all the time somewhere in the Pentagon, the rush of events in
Eastern Europe and the prospect of declines in defense budgets
added urgency to Cheney's request.
   Cheney should receive reports by March, the official said.
   The recommendations will guide early deliberations for budgets
in the 1992 fiscal year and after.
   Spending recommendations in the budget that President Bush will
present to Congress later this month are for the 1991 fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1. They are expected to include some weapons
cutbacks and result in a 2 percent drop in Pentagon spending after
accounting for inflation.
   But because of the balky and complex Pentagon budget-building
process, the 1991 budget is not expected to reflect a major
adjustment in the U.S. military response to the sweeping changes in
the Soviet Union and Europe, the source said.
   Much of the nation's military planning and spending are focused
on fighting a war with allies in Europe against the Soviet Union
and its allies, and have been ever since NATO was formed in 1949.
   A military source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Cheney's memorandum, dated mid-December, says the review
``should begin from basic principles.''
   The source said the memo does not specifically mention which
aircraft are to be studied, but that it is clear the secretary is
interested reviewing requirements for the top four billion-dollar
programs _ the B-2 Stealth bomber, the C-17 transport plane, as
well as the Air Force and Navy advanced fighter jets still under
development.
   ``The memo doesn't give a list of airplanes, but it's obvious
that he wants a look at future aircraft requirements ...,'' said
the military source said.
   He added that the memo ``puts into writing what a lot of people
have been thinking about in any case _ take a possible lessened
threat, and give me your judgment of our aircraft needs.''
   The source said that the memo does not suggest the possible
cancellation of any programs, but asks for ``a serious look at our
defense structure in the out-years ... It's clear we'll still need
a long-range bomber, fighters and transport planes, but the
questions are, what exactly do you need and how many?''

<TEXT>
   A jury began deliberating Wednesday in the
federal court trial of 20 men accused of smuggling or conspiring to
smuggle nearly 1.5 million pounds of marijuana into the United
States.
   With a quick verdict unlikely in the 2{-month-old trial, U.S.
District Judge John Shaw ordered overnight accommodations for the
jurors and said they would deliberate through the weekend if
necessary.
   One question they must weigh is whether the evidence pointed to
a single conspiracy or multiple, unrelated conspiracies.
   Prosecutors argued Tuesday that all 20 defendants played a
crucial role in a smuggling operation from 1982 to 1984.
   Defense attorneys portrayed a disjointed drug ring that smuggled
varying amounts of marijuana in separate, unconnected operations.
   The indictment alleges 187 people contributed to an overall
conspiracy that smuggled 48,000 pounds of marijuana into North
Carolina in November 1982 and 280,000 pounds into Louisiana in June
1983.
   In addition, the alleged conspiracy planned to smuggle in
another 1 million pounds in 1984, but that operation was scrapped
after the arrest of Stephen Michael Kalish, the admitted ringleader
and the prosecution's chief witness.
   ``What we have here is one single conspiracy consisting of four
ventures _ one criminal enterprise by one criminal organization,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Cobb Parker said. ``Each of these
ventures were part of a big picture and, when these defendants
joined the organization, they became a part of the big picture.''
   Defense attorney Don Wolff reminded jurors that Kalish testified
that each operation had its own starting date and its own ending
date, and none overlapped.
   Another trial with about as many defendants is scheduled for
Feb. 12. More than 30 of the original defendants pleaded guilty,
and cases of others were severed for separate trial.

<HEAD>Israel to Cut Size of Army Because of Uprising Costs</HEAD>

   Israel will cut the size of its army and reduce
the number of days reservists must serve next year to cover the
costs of handling the Palestinian uprising, a Defense Ministry
official said Wednesday.
   Also Wednesday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned that
Israel may lose an opportunity for peace by failing to show
flexibility in Middle East negotiations.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
nine Palestinians during stone-throwing protests, Arab reports
said. The army said it was checking the reports.
   The Defense Ministry official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, declined to say by how much Israel's standing army would
be reduced, but he said the goal was to trim 700,000 days from
total reserve duty.
   The Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies estimates the size of
Israel's army at 130,000 regular soldiers and 310,000 reservists.
The total force is 540,000 when air force and navy personnel are
included.
   Cutbacks also will affect the air force, Brig. Gen. Giora Rom,
the air force deputy commander, told Israel radio. He said the
cutbacks could affect combat readiness because there was less money
to fund practice flying hours.
   The ministry official said the cutbacks were necessary because
the Defense Ministry is not being fully compensated for the costs
of dealing with the uprising.
   Thousands of soldiers and paramilitary troops have been posted
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since December 1987, when
the Palestinian rebellion began.
   According to government figures, the Israeli army will have
spent about $470 million on the uprising by the time the fiscal
year ends March 30. The army estimates the 1990-91 fiscal year
costs will be $225 million.
   ``No doubt there will be very significant cuts'' in non-uprising
activities, the ministry official said, adding discussions were
still under way on exactly where cutbacks would be made.
   According to the 1990-91 budget approved by the Israeli Cabinet
on Dec. 26, defense spending in the fiscal year beginning April 1
will be $5.22 billion, about the same as the current year's total.
   At a speech in Jerusalem Wednesday, Rabin warned that current
Israeli policy was leading to a stalemate.
   ``Whenever one or the two superpowers will realize that the gap
between the positions of the ... parties to the conflict is too
wide, they tell the two parties `go to hell','' Rabin said.
   He spoke shortly before a planned trip to the United States
where he is to hold talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III over U.S. efforts to start an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   Israeli leaders failed to agree Wednesday on a response to a
letter from Baker that tried to reassure Israel it would not have
to negotiate with the PLO, which Israel views as a terrorist
organization.
   Some government officials complained the assurances were not
satisfactory, and Israel's four top leaders decided Wednesday to
send a message to Baker asking for further clarifications, Israel
radio and TV said.
   Baker has been trying to get agreement from Israel and Egypt on
Israeli-Palestinian talks in advance of a meeting with the two
countries' foreign ministers.
   Israel signaled Wednesday it may be ready to compromise by
agreeing to talk to a Palestinian delegation that includes two
Palestinians who were once deported by Israel.
   Israel has been reluctant to accept deportees as negotiators for
fear that would leave the door open for Palestine Liberation
Organization involvement.
   But some officials said they believed Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, head of the hard-line Likud bloc, would bend on the
question of Palestinian negotiators in order to keep alive his plan
for a peace settlement _ a plan on which he has staked much
prestige.
   Shamir's plan, ratified by the Israeli Cabinet May 14, envisages
holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as part of an
interim peace settlement of self-rule for Palestinians.
   Also Wednesday, police discovered the body of an Arab man, Ayman
Abdul Kammun, in Mughazi refugee camp in Gaza, Arab reports said.
Kammum was reportedly beaten and stabbed to death by fellow
Palestinians on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   His death raised to 168 the number of Palestinians slain by
fellow Arabs on suspicion of assisting Israel. At least 646 Arabs
have been killed by Israeli gunfire in the 25-month uprising in the
occupied territories and 43 Israelis have died in the violence.

<HEAD>10 Worst-Dressed Fashion Frumps `A Parade of Terror,'' Mr.

   Fashion critic Mr. Blackwell, who has ripped
into the wardrobes of celebrities for three decades, put LaToya
Jackson atop his worst-dressed roll Wednesday because he considers
her more freak than chic.
   ``In leather and chains, she's Cher for the 1990s,'' said the
outspoken oracle of style. ``If I had her face and body I'd stay in
bed all day.''
   The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at
Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore, Kim Basinger, Princess Anne, Emily
Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and, in a tie for 10th,
Madonna and Sandra Bernhard.
   ``The finalists were a parade of terrors that make The Joker in
`Batman' look positively conservative by comparison,'' said
Blackwell, a designer. ``Ninety-nine percent of these people could
be mistaken for a bag lady.''
   The year's uncontested fashion frump, however, was singer Grace
Jones: ``Darth Vader's S&amp;M fantasy in a Martian bird cage.''
   Blackwell, whose real name is Richard Sylvan Selzer, held court
at his well-appointed Hancock Park home to unveil the 30th annual
Worst-Dressed Women list.
   Television's Miss Barr was zinged as a ``bowling alley reject,''
actress Miss Moore, wife of actor Bruce Willis, was ``a spandexed
`Nightmare on Willis Street,'' and ``Batman's'' Miss Basinger was a
``parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the batcave.''
   Britain's Princess Anne was reduced to ``lumpy, dumpy and
frumpy,'' entertainer Cher to a ``bag of tattooed bones in a
sequinned slingshot,'' actress Miss Lloyd to ``a sweater girl for
Field &amp; Stream,'' actress Miss Hannah to a ``Vegas Venus on
steroids,'' singer-choreographer Miss Abdul to a ``fashion gypsy
(who) dances in the light (and) dresses in the dark,'' and singer
Madonna-comedian Bernhard to ``the Mutt and Jeff of MTV: vampy,
trampy ... and cartoon campy.''
   Blackwell, resplendent in a black double-breasted suit, also had
something good to say.
   His Top 10 list of Fabulous Fashion Independents included first
lady Barbara Bush, actress Geena Davis, Ivana Trump, actress Angela
Lansbury, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, entertainer
Liza Minnelli, television personality Barbara Walters, Vanity Fair
editor Tina Brown, Princess Diana and Jacqueline Onassis.
   Special barbs were aimed at Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler,
perennial Blackwell favorites who have been on his worst-dressed
list so often they are now lifetime holders of the dishonor.
   ``We don't have any star-status people anymore _ the Elizabeth
Taylors,'' he said. ``Poor Bette Midler, she's helpless. Why
bother? And Barbra Streisand, she's on some kick for visual
self-destruction.
   ``I don't know how she has a mirror in the house.''
   Blackwell said only two of his targets for disdain ever
complained _ actresses Beatrice Arthur and Dinah Shore.
   ``They were furious,'' he said. ``But most of them love to make
the list. I never insult them as people. This is an observation of
what they look like to me. I adore many of them as performers.''
   Blackwell also offered a dreary forecast for the 1990s.
   ``After a decade of glitz, it will be dull, boring and drab,
almost to a point where fashion will be mourning itself,'' he said.
The fashion future? ``Understatement is the trend for the 1990s.''

   East Germany's coalition government was
threatened with collapse Wednesday after three of its non-Communist
partners threatened to quit the Cabinet over dissatisfaction with
the Communist leadership.
   It was the most serious in a series of recent setbacks for
Communist Premier Hans Modrow, who reportedly was considering a
nationwide referendum in hopes of boosting his standing before
elections May 6.
   Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi was quoted as saying he thinks
a coalition breakup is possible before the voting in May.
   ``With the current pace of changes in the German Democratic
Republic (East Germany), nothing can be excluded in this area,''
the respected Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich quoted Gysi as saying.
Tensions in the coalition and stalled talks with the opposition as
made a breakup possible, he said.
   The interview was to appear in Thursday's edition of the
newspaper, and was sent in advance to other news media.
   Sources close to Wolfgang Berghofer, deputy chairman of the
Communist Party, said Berghofer is dissatisfied with Modrow's
leadership. Berghofer, who is also mayor of Dresden, has called on
Modrow to drop his opposition to free-market elements in East
Germany, the sources told The Associated Press.
   The No. 2 official in East Germany's economics ministry made a
similar call during a meeting with West German politicians in the
Bavarian village of Irsee.
   Klaus-Christian Fischer, the state secretary in the economics
ministry, said greater free-market elements are the only way to
stop the migration of East Germans to the West.
   Modrow remains committed to maintaining East Germany as a
socialist alternative to capitalist West Germany, which continues
to draw thousands of East Germans. Figures released Wednesday said
nearly 1,700 East Germans emigrate to West Germany each day.
   East Germany has undergone major changes, including the opening
of its borders, since the ouster of hard-line Communist leader
Erich Honecker on Oct. 18, but many of the new leaders' promises
have not been transformed into law.
   Leading the list is the proposed law that will actually
authorize the May 6 elections, planned as the country's first free
voting.
   The Christian Democrats and the Liberal Democrats, two of the
current coalition partners, said they will walk out if the new law
fails to meet their demands that opposition parties are guaranteed
``equal opportunity'' in the campaign.
   ``Equal opportunity'' refers to equal access to news media and
other means of reaching voters.
   ``The ministers of the Liberal Democratic Party are not hostages
of the Communist-led government,'' the party said in a statement.
   Together, the Christian Democrats and Liberal Democrats have
seven seats in the 28-member Cabinet. The National Democrats,
another non-Communist party with two seats, on Wednesday also
threatened to desert Modrow.
   All three parties cited growing dissatisfaction with Modrow's
leadership as reasons for the threatened pullout.
   The Christian Democrats and National Democrats also cited
Modrow's insistence on reviving a secret police apparatus that was
dissolved after the fall pro-democracy movement.
   If the Communists received a majority of public support in a
referendum, it would bolster their position going into the election
in May.
   Modrow was due to give a speech Thursday in Parliament, which
would have to approve plans to hold a referendum.
   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was making
opposition approval of any election law a condition of further work
with the current leadership of East Germany.
   That could be difficult, as the Communist-drafted election law
will bar all forms of campaign aid from other countries _ a slap in
the face to West Germans hoping to help the opposition.
   Kohl told reporters further talks with Modrow are needed, in
part to stop the flood of East Germans into his country.
   Kohl also said he expects to meet Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev this year. The two men last met in June in Bonn.
   New signs of East Germany's economic problems emerged Wednesday.
   The official Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland said recent
warning strikes by dissatisfied industrial workers were partly
justified by a slow reaction of authorities to their grievances.
   The stoppages were called to protest special severance payments
to state security agents dismissed in the government's dissolution
of the ministry they worked for.
   Neues Deutschland said the state can continue to guarantee
``social security'' only if industrial workers keep the economy
running by staying on the job.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The justice minister has confirmed
reports that army troops hunting for dissidents killed civilians,
but said the killing was in self-defense and denied it was
indiscriminate.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement Wednesday
in which it ``noted with concern credible reports of civilian
casualties in the fighting in Liberia.''
   ``We deplore actions, whether by government troops or
insurgents, which lead to such casualties,'' the statement said,
adding the State Department had been in contact with governments in
the region.
   At a news conference Tuesday, Liberia's Justice Minister Jenkins
Scott denied soldiers indiscriminately killed civilians while
hunting for dissidents who crossed into the Nimba region from
neighboring Ivory Coast.
   ``Upon the arrival, the army was attacked by people in civilian
clothes, so what did you expect them to do?'' he said.
   ``For instance, if a mother has a baby in her arms and has a gun
in her hand and is approaching you, will you say you should take
the baby and put it down before attacking?'' he added.
   Scott said the rebel National Patriotic Front, led by former
Liberian civil servant Charles Taylor, was responsible for the
deaths.
   ``Blame Charles Taylor and his cohorts,'' he said.
   The government says Taylor sent about 100 rebels into the Nimba
area on Dec. 24 in an effort to overthrow President Samuel K. Doe,
who came to power in a violent 1980 coup.
   Doe said the rebels killed more than 200 civilians in the next
two weeks before his forces brought the situation under control.
   But Africa Watch, a human rights group, said in Washington on
Tuesday that Liberian soldiers killed at least 200 civilians after
the attempted coup. Africa Watch is a division of the private Human
Rights Watch that monitors abuses around the world.
   Liberians who fled to Ivory Coast to escape the fighting also
accused Doe's troops of gunning down civilians. As many as 10,000
Liberians reportedly have sought refuge in Ivory Coast since the
fighting began.
   Scott said two paramilitary officers were killed during the
Nimba invasion and that 16 border officials were missing or dead.
   Doe has accused Ivory Coast of harboring Liberian dissidents and
claimed Taylor's band was trained in Burkina Faso and Libya.
   In support of his charge, the government Wednesday televised
statements from two men it described as captured rebels.
   The men, identified as Harrison Diakpo and Alfred Suomie, both
of the Nimba area, said they first met some of Taylor's dissidents
in Burkina Faso in 1987. Diakpo said he was living in Ivory Coast
when his brother-in-law, whom he did not identify, urged Diakpo to
join him for business reasons in the capital, where they were given
bus tickets to Burkina Faso's capital.
   From Burkina Faso, Diakpo said they were taken to a camp near
Tripoli, Libya, where Libyan authorities gave them sophisticated
military training.
   He said they also received training at a farm in Ivory Coast
owned by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   The Ivory Coast government has denied supporting coup attempts
against Liberia.

   Iran has given the go-ahead to resume stymied
peace talks with Iraq and this time the talks will be held in the
Soviet Union and mediated by the Soviets, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Wednesday.
   He said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati had sent a message
to Moscow saying Iran was willing to resume the talks, which
stalled last April in Geneva.
   Iraq agreed earlier to the Soviet proposal for trilateral talks,
so ``now it is possible to start the practical working-out of this
question,'' Gerasimov told a Moscow briefing.
   He said he had no information yet about a date or site.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze offered Soviet mediation
help during an official visit to Iran in August.
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's main supplier in the 8-year Persian
Gulf war and the two countries are bound by a treaty of friendship
and cooperation.
   Iran has signed big natural gas deals and other trade agreements
with Moscow, reversing years of bad relations when it grouped the
Soviet Union with America as a ``Great Satan.''
   No progress was reported at the last round of direct
negotiations between Velayati and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   U.N.-sponsored Iran-Iraq talks began five days after a
cease-fire took effect Aug. 20, 1988, but have remained deadlocked
despite several rounds of negotiations.

<HEAD>Kremlin Blasts Armenia, Azerbaijan Over Territorial Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Soviet
leaders on Wednesday condemned and voided resolutions passed by
legislatures in Armenia and Azerbaijan making conflicting claims
over the Nagorno-Karabakh territory.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet legislature, headed by
Gorbachev, branded as unconstitutional resolutions adopted by the
Armenian legislature that called for reuniting the republic with
Nagorno-Karabakh, Tass reported.
   Most of Nagorno-Karabakh's people are Armenian, but it has been
under Azerbaijan's control since 1923. The row over who should
control it led to strikes and violence in February 1988. More than
200 people have been killed.
   It has proved to be the most stubborn of all the ethnic
conflicts that have surfaced under Gorbachev, and has even grown
worse despite attempts at mediation by Gorbachev himself and the
national legislature.
   According to Tass, the official news agency, the Presidium said
Armenia cannot take control of Nagorno-Karabakh without
Azerbaijan's consent. It said the Armenian legislature's
resolution, passed Dec. 1, had made the situation worse in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Bombings, sniper fire and hostage-taking reportedly are
continuing in the territory.
   The Soviet leadership said another Armenian resolution adopted
Tuesday and incorporating an economic and social development plan
for Nagorno-Karabakh into that of the Armenian republic, infringes
on Azerbaijan's sovereignty. The Presidium voided the resolution.
   Azerbaijanis have been holding mass rallies to protest the
Armenian legislature's action and have resumed a railroad blockade
of Armenia.
   The Presidium also voided an action by Azerbaijan's legislative
leaders, who adopted a decree Dec. 4 entitled ``On Measures to
Normalize the Situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region
of the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic.''
   The Presidium declared the measure unconstitutional. No
immediate word emerged on the contents of the measure and it was
not clear what the Presidium objected to.
   The national legislature in Moscow in November disbanded a
commission that had imposed direct Kremlin rule on the hilly region
of about 160,000 people. It said the area is part of Azerbaijan and
would be controlled by local government bodies under supervision of
a national commission.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, meanwhile, reported
Wednesday that six Soviet Moslems swam across the Aras River to
Iran over the weekend despite sub-freezing temperatures, and later
swam back to the Soviet Union.
   Recent protests in Soviet Azerbaijan have demanded freer travel
between the Soviet Union and Iran.
   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said the six used inflated rubber
tubes on Tuesday when they swam back to the northern, Soviet bank
of the river which forms part of the border.
   The state-run Soviet newspaper Izvestia said unrest which began
Dec. 31 flared Monday when Soviet Azerbaijanis gathered at the
border and called through loudspeakers for their Iranian neighbors
to unify their regions.
   The Azerbaijanis are an ethnic group who, like most Iranians,
are largely Shiite Moslems.
   In Ankara, Azerbaijan and Turkey agreed on Wednesday to
establish joint ventures in investment and marketing.
   A protocol, signed at the end of Azerbaijani Premier Ayaz
Niyazioglu Muttalibov's five-day visit, calls for cooperation in
construction, petro-chemicals production, mining,
telecommunications, food processing and development of small
industry. Tourism will also be developed.

   Panama and the United States signed
an agreement Wednesday to fight drug trafficking, but Panama
resisted U.S. pressure to change banking laws to prevent money
laundering.
   ``They want us to simply open our books and we cannot let them
do that,'' Eduardo Lasso Valdez, president of the Bankers
Association, told The Associated Press. ``We think we have enough
safeguards now to prevent money laundering.'
   Melvin Levitsky, U.S. assistant secretary of state for
international narcotics matters, and Ramon Lima, vice minister of
government and justice, signed what was called an ``umbrella
agreement'' covering all aspects of the war against drugs.
   It includes U.S. assistance to help Panama structure its
agencies to fight drug trafficking; exchange of information;
investigation and prosecution of money laundering connected with
drug traffic; and eradication of illicit drug crops, processing
sites and laboratories.
   Levitsky said he will recommend that President Bush certify
Panama as a nation committed to fighting drug traffic.
Certification would enable Panama to qualify for special
consideration dealing with trade and assistance.
   Washington sent more than a dozen Drug Enforcement Adminstration
agents and a like number of FBI agents here shortly after the Dec.
20 U.S. invasion.
   They are investigating the operations of ousted dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega, now imprisoned in Miami awaiting trial on drug
charges.
   Panamanian bankers insist drug money laundering was never a big
problem here and that their controls kept it to a minimum.
   Panama's international banking center, with more than 101 banks,
is patterned after that of Switzerland and provides coded accounts
and protects confidentiality.
   ``Anything we do to affect confidentiality of the system would
destroy the banking center,'' Lasso said.
   But Levitsky said ``money laundering was an important aspect of
drug trafficking through Panama'' under Noriega, and indicated the
United States wants Panama to make changes in the system.
   U.S. experts have said drug traffickers began staying clear of
Panama when the U.S. clampdown on Noriega began, and that in any
case plenty of alternative places exist to launder money.
   Vice President Guillermo Ford said Panama had its own controls
to prevent money laundering.
   Panamanian bankers say claims of money laundering here were
exaggerated, and one bank's license was lifted five years ago.
   Another bank agreed to pay a $5 million fine following U.S.
charges it took part in money laundering by accepting large
transfers from a U.S. bank.
   Nothing happened to the U.S. bank, one Panamanian banker said,
adding that the case indicated U.S. authorities ``were not very
serious about the crime.''
   Lasso said, ``We are willing to cooperate with authorities. We
want to avoid being used by the drug dealers, but we want to
protect our clients, too.''
   He said indications emerged that U.S. officials want access to
information ``on suspicion only. If they show us some evidence, we
always cooperate.''
   Panamanian banks limit to $50,000 the amount of cash that an
individual may deposit at one time.
   ``Even so, each case is studied invididually,'' Lasso said. ``We
have other controls of the flow of cash to prevent money
laundering.''

<TEXT>
   Police set up roadblocks around Lima on
Wednesday and detained 15,000 people in a search for the killers of
former Defense Minister Enrique Lopez, the most prominent victim of
Peru's 10-year-old guerrilla war.
   Flags flew at half-staff and the government declared a national
day of mourning in honor of Lopez, who was buried Wednesday at a
Lima cemetery.
   Lopez was shot Tuesday as he was parking his car near a shopping
center in a Lima suburb. Doctors said he suffered at least 10
bullet wounds, and police blamed Maoist guerrillas of the Shining
Path rebel group.
   Early Wednesday, the guerrillas struck again, killing nine
people in Tocota, about 540 miles southeast of Lima.
   Police in Huancayo said Shining Path insurgents shot to death
two high school students in that highlands market town 140 miles
east of Lima after dragging them from their homes Wednesday.
   President Alan Garcia on Tuesday called it ``unpardonable'' no
bodyguards were with Lopez when he was shot, and some political
leaders suggested on Wednesday that Interior Minister Agustin
Mantilla and Defense Minister Julio Velasquez should resign.
   A congressional commission issued a statement Wednesday saying
it asked Mantilla and Velasquez to explain why Lopez did not have a
security escort at the time he was killed.
   Sen. Armando Villanueva, who served as prime minister and
interior minister under Garcia, commented, ``I'd like to point out
that when, in a similar situation, two congressmen were killed, I
resigned.''
   Garcia and members of his Cabinet attended the funeral, as did
former President Fernando Belaunde Terry, under whom Lopez served
as chief of palace security, and presidential candidate and
novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.
   Police units assisted by six helicopters sealed off highways
leading from the capital and stopped about 8,000 cars in search of
suspected rebels, according to an Interior Ministry official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said about 15,000 people were detained, most for not having
proper documents. Most will be released in a few days, he said.
   Lopez was army commander under Garcia until he was named Peru's
first defense minister in October 1987, the year the army, navy and
air force were joined under one department.
   Lopez resigned in May during a Cabinet shake-up brought about in
part by the guerrilla war. Villanueva was forced to resign as prime
minister after being criticized for the country's economic collapse
and his inability to stop the growth of guerrilla violence.
   As is customary, Lopez and the rest of the Cabinet offered their
resignations, and Lopez's departure was friendly. He was replaced
by army Gen. Julio Velasquez.
   Lopez then worked as an executive in a chemical company that has
its offices in the shopping complex where he was killed.
   The assassination was the Shining Path's first of the year. Last
year, they were blamed for more than 3,000 deaths.
   Political leaders urged the government to improve security
measures for public figures.
   Garcia said Tuesday that Lopez's assassination ``means that
despite the barbarous crimes being committed here, the military
institutions are not yet conscious of the fact that we are in a
state of war.''
   On Wednesday, Garcia told reporters the attack showed the
Shining Path is losing its fight for popular support and turning to
terror.
   ``The terrorists already know they are being defeated. They are
having to look for a psychological opportunity to frighten the
nation,'' Garcia said.
   Writing in the Lima newspaper Expreso, columnist Manuel
D'Ornellas said the Shining Path's objective is to provoke the
military into staging a coup.
   ``In this way, the Shining Path would achieve its objective of
putting itself in the vanguard of a popular rejection of a
dictatorship.''
   Vargas Llosa, running in the April 8 presidential elections,
urged the public not to be intimidated and demanded the government
take necessary precautions to guarantee the safety and integrity of
the election.
   The Shining Path launched its insurgency in 1980 in the southern
Andean highlands. It now operates throughout the highlands and in
the coca-producing jungles in the northeast, as well as Lima and
other urban centers along the coast.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in the
violence.
   A report by the Senate Human Rights Commission said 1989 was the
bloodiest year yet, resulting in more than 3,200 deaths, most of
them civilians.
   Police said Shining Path guerrillas Wednesday killed nine
people, including the mayor and former mayor of Tocota, the capital
of Huanuhuanu district. The victims were shot in the central plaza,
police said.

<HEAD>Mandela Lawyer Says Release Could Take Months</HEAD>

   Imprisoned black nationalist
Nelson Mandela is anxious to be released from prison, but it could
take months, a lawyer who visited him Wednesday said.
   The comment by prominent attorney Azhar Cachalia after a
five-hour meeting with Mandela contradicted a statement made Monday
by Mandela's wife, Winnie, after a visit with her husband. ``I
don't think we are talking about months,'' she said, after noting
that for the first time her husband had discussed arrangements for
his release.
   The comments also seemed at odds with the impression given by a
government-run radio editorial Wednesday that said Mandela's
release was ``only a matter of time.''
   ``Mr. Mandela stressed it is his desire to be released as soon
as possible. He, however, has no idea when he will be released,''
Cachalia said. ``It could take a few months.''
   Walter Sisulu, a colleague from Mandela's African National
Congress who was sentenced to life in prison along with him, also
appeared to disagree with Mrs. Mandela.
   ``The only difference now is the wife has an impression that it
will soon happen,'' Sisulu said in an interview with CBS-TV
Wednesday. ``I still regard it as a mere speculation.''
   It is illegal to quote Mandela directly, so his visitors
paraphrase the remarks they consider significant. Conflicting
statements from different sets of visitors have been issued in the
past.
   In recent weeks, there has been almost daily speculation in the
media on Mandela's release, and President F.W. de Klerk is widely
expected to make an announcement on Mandela's status when he opens
Parliament Feb. 1.
   Imprisoned in 1962, Mandela is serving a life term for plotting
a sabotage campaign to undermine the white minority government. He
is regarded by many blacks as the man who should be their president.
   Sisulu said the government has problems about releasing Mandela
``in a vacuum,'' with the ANC and other organizations still
outlawed and a state of emergency in place.
   The editorial by Radio South Africa was interpreted by some
observers as the strongest signal yet that Mandela's freedom is
imminent.
   ``It has been clear for some months that it is only a matter of
time before Mr. Mandela's release is announced,'' the radio said.
``Moreover, by identifying himself with the ideals of peaceful
development he has redefined his position.''
   For most of Mandela's 27 years in prison, the government has
portrayed him and his outlawed guerrilla movement as terrorists and
communists, although Mandela said he took up arms only because the
government refused to talk to blacks about change.
   Recently the government has described Mandela in favorable
terms, in an apparent attempt to prepare the white community for
his release.
   ``He would be in a position to make an important contribution to
the creation of the conditions in which (black-white) talks could
get under way,'' the radio said.
   Since last year, Mandela has been meeting with Cabinet
ministers, as well as a wide range of anti-apartheid activists and
old friends at his house on the grounds of the Victor Verster
prison farm in the wine-growing region north of Cape Town.
   He met Dec. 13 with de Klerk, and last July with former
President P.W. Botha.
   De Klerk wants to open negotiations on a new constitution with
black leaders, but says the ANC must commit itself to peaceful
solutions before it can participate.
   The ANC, in a statement Monday marking its 78th anniversary,
said its guerrilla campaign remained an important part of its
struggle for black political rights. But it also said, ``We are
committed to seize any real opportunity that might emerge genuinely
to seek a political agreement for the speedy end of the apartheid
system.''
   Sisulu said in his television interview, which was also
broadcast in South Africa, that he expects apartheid to end within
the decade.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, after repeatedly
urging farmers to manage risks by buying federal crop insurance,
plans to propose eliminating the program, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole said Wednesday.
   ``What this may do is to get Congress to focus on it,'' Dole
said during his appearance at the Kansas State Board of
Agriculture's annual meeting.
   ``There are a lot of members of Congress who don't want to
eliminate crop insurance. I'm one. I want to get more people to
participate. You've got to make certain you cover their losses,''
Dole said.
   In a speech to the board and at a news conference later, Dole
said the proposal appears to be the administration's way of ending
duplicate payments to farmers from the crop insurance program and
disaster relief legislation.
   ``I think the administration has decided, and I don't know all
of their reasoning, that we're going to do one or another,'' said
the Kansas Republican, senior member of the Senate Agriculture
Committee.
   The $400 million a year federal subsidy for crop insurance
premiums could be counted as a savings by the administration as it
attempts to cut $1 billion from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
annual budget, the senator said.
   Dole and Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., acknowledge that even if the
crop insurance program were fine-tuned, there still would be
disaster relief bills. Roberts advocates legislation to standardize
Congress' response to crop disasters.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who serves with Roberts on the House
Agriculture Committee, said talk of eliminating crop insurance is
being used as a trial balloon to evaluate congressional and public
reaction to the idea.

   A federal judge Wednesday refused to reinstate
a woman into a high school honors club that kicked her out in 1983
after she became pregnant.
   U.S. District Judge Barron McCune ruled the case was moot
because there is no longer a National Honor Society chapter at
Marion Center Area High School. However, he rejected arguments that
the dismissal was discriminatory.
   The student's lawyer had argued that because a woman's sexual
activities are readily apparent when she becomes pregnant, the
dismissal was discriminatory.
   McCune wrote the student was dismissed because of premarital
sex, not because she had a child out of wedlock.
   In dismissing her from the club, the school's faculty council
said she failed to uphold requirments of character and leadership.
   Arlene Kerner, now 23, was thrown out of the club in November
1983, during her senior year and two months after the birth of her
child, Jessica.
   ``I am dissappointed and we are going to appeal the decision,''
Mrs. Kerner said.
   In early 1984, Mrs. Kerner sued in federal court here seeking
reinstatment in the honor society. She named the Marion Center Area
School District, which is about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, and 15
school officials and teachers.

<HEAD>Dodd: U.S. Won't Settle for Half-hearted Prosecution of Jesuit
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd on
Wednesday said the United States will tolerate nothing less than
full prosecution of the killers of six Jesuit priests.
   The Connecticut Democrat also strongly urged the administration
of President Alfredo Cristiani and leftist rebels battling the
government to negotiate an end to the 10-year-old civil war.
   Cristiani, a rightist, on Sunday announced that ``certain
elements of the armed forces'' were responsible for the Nov. 16
massacre of six Jesuit priests and educators, their housekeeper and
her daughter. He did not provide names, ranks, units or the number
of people involved.
   The army chief said two officers and 45 soldiers of an elite
infantry battalion have been confined to base on suspicion of
participation in the slayings.
   ``We commend the government for having proceded as expeditiously
as they have.'' said Dodd, who was accompanied at a news conference
by Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
   But he addressed the concerns of those who note that no officer
has been tried or convicted for any crime of human rights abuse
since civil war broke out in late 1979. Rightist death squads
sponsored or tolerated by the military killed thousands of
suspected leftists in the early 1980s.
   ``It is very important to remember we've been there before.
We've seen investigations with a lot of notoriety and then those
investigations sort of fade and disappear and prosecutions never
occur,'' he said.
   ``That cannot happen in this case. It won't do if you just
arrest a couple soldiers.''
   Dodd said the successful prosecution of the case could be a
factor in the next vote on U.S. aid to El Salvador in the spring.
   Dodd is chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The large-scale November offensive by the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front demonstrated the rebels ``were militarily
stronger than many people thought they were,'' said Dodd.
   But he said the failure to topple Cristiani also demonstrated
the guerrillas' lack of popular support.
   ``That means an opportunity now exists for a negotiated
settlement. Our hope is that this opportunity will not be lost,
that the Cristiani government and the military will take advantage,
as we hope the FMLN will as well, to begin seriously to try to
bring an end to this conflict,'' he said.
   The two senators are on a fact-finding tour of Central America.
Warner is to return to the United States on Thursday, while Dodd
planned a stop in Honduras.

   The last two members of a religious cult were
arrested Wednesday in Southern California, ending a nationwide
manhunt for 13 people accused in the slayings of an Ohio family of
five, authorities said.
   Law enforcement officers stopped a northbound pickup on Highway
79 about 60 miles northeast of San Diego and arrested Daniel David
Kraft and Kathryn Johnson, said agent James Stathes of the U.S.
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The two suspects were taken to a San Diego County sheriff's
substation pending pending transfer to the ATF office in San Diego,
Stathes said. The pickup truck was impounded for an ATF search.
   ``We had no idea where they would be,'' Stathes said. ``We had
our lookouts all over the place and we were hoping that they would
head out and they did. It worked.
   ``I'm glad they're in custody,'' he said. ``Now we can get some
rest.''
   Kraft, 25, of Nauvoo, Ill., and Johnson, 36, of Holden, Mo., had
eluded authorities since the arrests of cult leader Jeffrey
Lundgren, 39; his wife, Alice, 38; and son, Damon, 19, at a motel
Sunday in National City near San Diego.
   The five are among 13 people indicted by an Ohio grand jury in
the slayings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three children.
Their bodies were unearthed last week at a farm near Kirtland,
Ohio, near Cleveland. They had been bound hand and foot, and some
cases gagged, with duct tape, and each had been shot twice.
   Lundgren is a defrocked lay minister of the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints of Kirtland, Ohio, who was
able to persuade other church members to follow him after being
ousted for radical teachings.
   The Averys have been identified as members of the cult led by
Lundgren. Authorities believe the victims were killed last April in
a ritual sacrifice designed to ``cleanse'' the cult and allow it to
relocate in the wilderness.
   The bodies were discovered after an informant told federal
agents about the New Year's Eve killings.
   The Lundgrens refused to waive extradition to Ohio on Tuesday,
forcing authorities to begin extradition proceedings that could
take up to 90 days.
   Ohio prosecutor Steven LaTourette said Lundgren and his son face
five counts of aggravated murder. If convicted, they could face the
death penalty.
   The charges against Alice Lundgren include five counts of
conspiracy to commit murder.
   Kraft is charged with five counts of first-degree murder.
Johnson is charged with five count of conspiracy to commit murder
and kidnapping.
   Authorities found an assortment of firearms and knives,
thousands of rounds of ammunition, gas masks and other paramilitary
equipment at the National City motel and at a storage unit in
nearby Chula Vista
   Other weapons, including a .50-caliber rifle belonging to
Johnson, were found Tuesday in a Chula Vista motel, federal
officials said.
   Lundgren's former church, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints, is based in Independence, Mo. It has roots
and some beliefs in common with the Salt Lake City-based Mormon
Church, but is separate.

   Thousands of Lithuanians defied the
Kremlin and cried ``Freedom!'' at a pro-independence rally
Wednesday, the eve of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
high-stakes visit.
   Banners held by some of the 20,000 people who massed on
Cathedral Square ranged from one polite welcome to blunt calls for
Gorbachev to go home _ and take the Red Army with him.
   ``We didn't join the Soviet Union, you grabbed us!'' read one
banner, referring to the Soviet Union's absorption of the Baltic
republic in 1940.
   Gorbachev is scheduled to arrive Thursday and meet for three
days with factory workers, collective farmers, members of ethnic
minorities and Communist Party activists to press for reversal of
the Lithuanian Communist Party's decision last month to split from
the national party and support independence for the Baltic republic.
   As never before in his nearly five years in power, the Kremlin
chief will put his personal prestige on the line to cool one of his
country's hottest ethnic crises.
   Although he has granted Lithuanians and their neighbors in
Estonia and Latvia a large measure of economic and political power,
he has consistently and sharply criticized Lithuanian Communist
leaders for pressing for complete independence, and convened an
emergency session of the national party Central Committee last
month to discuss the issue.
   The stakes for the visit are high. If Gorbachev fails to bring
the Lithuanians back to the fold, Communist parties in the 14 other
republics could feel encouraged to break with Moscow.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, the leader of Sajudis, Lithuania's popular
political movement, said his countrymen are not trying to hurt
Gorbachev's reforms but are showing other republics ``how certain
problems can be solved in a peaceful, diplomatic manner.''
   ``It's not destabilization. It's de-Stalinization,'' he told a
news conference, referring to attempts to abandon the rigid,
centrally controlled political and economic systems Stalin devised.
   In the past two years, Sajudis-backed candidates have defeated
hard-line Communists in elections and helped the republic win some
economic independence from Moscow ministries.
   Landsbergis said the drive for change cannot be stopped.
   ``We hope the Soviet government is coming to see the
inevitability of the changes in Eastern Europe and that Lithuania
is part of that process,'' he said.
   Sajudis leaders hope to draw 1 million people to the capital
Vilnius on Thursday to show Gorbachev the wide support for
independence.
   He is treating the Communist Party split as a critical setback
in his reform program. The Soviet leader sent a crew of top-level
national party officials headed by Kremlin ideology chief Vadim A.
Medvedev to lobby party members in all walks of life in preparation
for his visit.
   In a Thursday-dated dispatch from Vilnius, the Soviet news
agency Tass said Medvedev spoke in Vilnius ``about democratization
processes in the party and supported those who voiced concern over
the threat to national accord in the republic and anxiety for the
fate of the Soviet Communist Party.''
   The dispatch ended, ``These days are far from simple for the
republic. They are filled with anxiety, meditations and concern for
the future. Lithuania's population is looking forward to
Gorbachev's arrival and meetings with him.''
   Although activists in Lithuania, which was absorbed by the
Soviet Union along with the other Baltic republics of Latvia and
Estonia, have been approaching the call for independence for 18
months, some say independence is years away even in their most
favorable scenarios.
   Gorbachev last visited one of the Baltic republics in February
1987, when he traveled to Riga, the capital of Latvia. Lithuanian
activists say he hasn't been in their republic in a decade.
   A spokesman for Sajudis, Rimantas Kanapienis, said Medvedev
personally asked a leader of the group to call off Wednesday's
rally.
   But it went ahead under red, yellow and green flags of
independent Lithuania and was designed to tell Gorbachev it is too
late to change the course for independence.
   ``Lithuania Has Already Decided,'' said one sign.
   Speakers appealed to independence advocates to stay calm during
Gorbachev's visit. ``We must make our demands peacefully,'' said
one. The demonstrators also used Lenin's words to make their point.
   Referring to Lenin's recognition of Lithuania as an independent
nation in 1920, two decades before Stalin forcibly annexed the
Baltics, one sign read: ``Lenin recognized Lithuania. Stalin took
away its independence, and Gorbachev?''
   One ethnic Russian born in Vilnius said compromise is necessary.
   ``Lithuania must help Gorbachev and his reforms in the Soviet
Union,'' said the man, who identified himself as Yura and said he
has taken advantage of the Soviet leader's reforms to build a small
private business exporting mushrooms.
   According to an official schedule obtained by Sajudis, Gorbachev
will arrive Thursday and visit a Vilnius electronics factory. On
Friday, he is to meet with the public in the city of Panevyzus. On
Saturday, he will meet with Communist Party activists.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Twenty Fingers, Twenty Toes'' is 40 digits of
desperation.
   The new musical now on view at the WPA Theater off-Broadway is
an unpleasant, unfunny biography of the Hilton Sisters, real-life
Siamese twins who made it big in vaudeville during the 1920s and
later appeared in Todd Browning's classic horror movie ``Freaks.''
   Creators Michael Dansicker and Bob Nigro have opted for a campy,
cartoon backstage saga, complete with an evil aunt _ the twins'
mother sold them at birth _ and a smarmy agent, who conspire to
steal the girls' sizable earnings.
   During the show's long two acts, there is a lot of singing about
the fact that the twins don't have a mother and that when the girls
dance, they have four left feet.
   A frantic tastelessness pervades this show which tries to make
the sisters into sympathetic characters, only to knock them down a
minute later with some dumb joke about their physical condition.
   Dansicker's music is relentlessly perky, monotonous hurdy-gurdy
melodies. His lyrics are equally cheery if undistinguished. The
book, co-written by Dansicker and Nigro, parades the sisters
through a series of stage routines on what seems to be the entire
Ohio vaudeville circuit.
   Every so often the mean aunt and the sneering agent threaten to
send the girls to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore to be separated. If
that happens, one will die.
   Ann Brown and Maura Hanlon sing sweetly as the sisters, stitched
together in costume designer Gregg Barnes' double outfits. But
Roxie Lucas, so wonderful in last season's edition of ``Forbidden
Broadway,'' is completely over the top as the villainous aunt.
Lucas doesn't just chew the scenery, she devours it. Paul Kandel,
as the girls' agent, keeps up with her, bite for bite.
   Ken Prymus gives new meaning to the term ``split personality''
in what is probably the season's most impossible role. He plays a
hermaphrodite named Bert and Bertha who gives the twins the courage
to ditch their aunt and set out for California and movie stardom.
   ``Twenty Fingers, Twenty Toes'' is the second musical dud in a
row at the WPA. The theater inflicted a slasher musical ``Buzzsaw
Berkeley'' on its audiences earlier in the season. Both shows have
been part of the WPA's so-called ``Silly Series.'' ``Awful'' would
be a more appropriate adjective.

<HEAD>State: East Coldenham School Wall Not Properly Braced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flaws in the design of an elementary school
cafeteria wall that collapsed and killed nine children in November
left it unable to withstand high winds, state officials concluded
Wednesday.
   Students at the East Coldenham Elementary School near Newburgh
were unaware of severe weather warnings during the storms Nov. 16,
said a report by the state Disaster Preparedness Commission.
   The commission, in the first official account of the causes of
the disaster, recommended improved review of new school
construction plans and better weather warning systems.
   Nine children lunching in the East Coldenham cafeteria were
killed in a hail of brick, concrete and glass when a storm with
90-to 100-mph winds slammed into the school. Fifteen students were
injured.
   The 55-by-25-foot wall, built in 1959, was a masonry structure
surrounded by a series of metal-framed windows. An engineer hired
by the state concluded the wall was not designed to withstand winds
of more than 45 mph, although state building codes said it should
have been designed to take winds of at least 75 mph.
   If it wasn't for the windows surrounding the masonry wall, the
wall would likely have tumbled long ago, said Peter Slocum, a
spokesman for both the state Health Department and the disaster
commission.
   The windows increased the wall's capacity to withstand winds up
to 80 mph.
   ``There were enough standards at the time to provide guidance to
the professionals for an adequate design of the wall,'' said
Richard Tomasetti, an engineer hired by the state to investigate
the collapse. ``The wall, unfortunately, was not adequately
designed.''
   The state's Office of Professional Discipline is investigating
the school's architect, John Clark of Hyde Park, said Thomas Sobol,
state education commissioner.
   Clark was not in his office Wednesday afternoon and was not
available for comment. He has repeatedly refused to respond to
reporters' questions since the East Coldenham disaster.
   Howard Finkelstein, a Newburgh lawyer, said he's filed a notice
of claim that he intends to sue Clark and the Valley Central School
District on behalf of six of the dead children and 13 of the
injured youngsters. He said the report buttresses the families'
case.
   ``This is not an act of God,'' Finkelstein said. ``God did not
build the wall. There are human failings that took place for which
someone is going to be responsible.''

outbuildings, and charred the land in rural parts of eastern
Oklahoma.
   A fire that began about 1 p.m. east of Noble scorched about 9
square miles and claimed 10 residences, said police Sgt. Matt
Bettis. ``They're just slabs on the ground. Eight homes and two
house trailers,'' Bettis said.
   He said the blaze was under control at about 8:30 p.m. There
were no injuries, he said. Noble is about 20 miles south of
Oklahoma City.
   An Oklahoma City Fire Department dispatcher said three fires in
the metropolitan area had damaged ``about seven'' homes, the
dispatcher said.
   There were no reports of residents being hurt, but a few
firefighters suffered minor injuries in Oklahoma County, the
dispatcher said.
   Portions of Interstate 40 near Oklahoma City had to be closed
for a time because of the heavy smoke, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol
said.
   In eastern Oklahoma, wildfires involved as many as 600 acres.

<HEAD>Former Noriega Official Leaves Vatican Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former director of immigration
under Manuel Antonio Noriega, charged with selling passports and
visas, left the Vatican Embassy on Wednesday and gave up to U.S.
troops, an embassy official said.
   Former director Belgica de Castillo and her husband, Carlos
Castillo, left the nunciature of their own accord, said the Rev.
Joseph Spiteri.
   Still inside is Capt. Eliezer Gaytan, chief of Noriega's
personal security force.
   The Castillos sought refuge shortly after U.S. troops invaded on
Dec. 20. Deposed dictator Noriega himself holed up in the embassy
from Dec. 24 to Jan. 3 before turning himself over to U.S. soldiers.
   Spiteri said a U.S. military vehicle picked up the Castillos and
took them to a U.S. base.
   Panama's new government said Monday that eight former
immigration officials, including Mrs. Castillo, were being charged
with corruption for selling visas and passports.
   Attorney General Rogelio Cruz announced Wednesday that a private
law firm had filed a complaint against Manuel Solis Palma, who
served as acting president for six months in 1988, but was never
recognized by the United States, which considered him a Noriega
puppet.
   The complaint accusing Solis Palma of ``usurping public
functions and committing crimes against political liberties'' was
being investigated, Cruz said.
   He said Solis Palma, now a private citizen in Panama, asked for
a guarantee he would not be arrested if he agreed to meet with
authorities for questioning.
   Solis Palma replaced President Eric Arturo Delvalle after
Delvalle tried to fire Noriega in February 1988 and was acting
president until Sept. 1, 1988.
   New U.S. Ambassador Deane R. Hinton presented his credentials to
President Guillermo Endara on Wednesday and said U.S.-Panamanian
relations were ``perfect'' following Noriega's ouster.
   ``I see no problems now,'' Hinton said, speaking to reporters in
Spanish after meeting Endara. ``We will support and work with the
democratic government of Panama.''
   John Grant McDonald, the new British ambassador, also presented
his credentials but made no statement.
   Panamanians continued to pick over the remains of the building
in downtown Panama City where Noriega had his military
headquarters, toting away everything from furniture to track
lighting and pornography.
   The building, heavily damaged by fighting in the invasion, will
be demolished on Thursday, Housing Minister Raul Figueroa said.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Panamanians linked to
Noriega have taken refuge in the embassies of Bolivia, Ecuador,
Peru, Cuba and the Vatican. All but the Bolivian mission are
surrounded by U.S. troops.
   Cruz said two of the 12 Panamanians who sought refuge in the
Peruvian Embassy were suspects in the killing of Maj. Moises
Giroldi, who led an unsuccessful coup attempt against Noriega on
Oct. 3.
   He did not identify the two but said the Foreign Ministry would
tell Peru ``they are not being persecuted politically'' and so
could not be given asylum.
   Noriega's family is in the Cuban Embassy. Linares said Panama is
considering their request for safe-conduct to the Dominican
Republic but must first decide whether they can be charged with any
offenses.

<HEAD>Wanted Priest Dismissed from Religious Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Ryan, an Irishman sought for
terroist offenses in Britain, has been dismissed from his religious
order in the Roman Catholic priesthood, a priest said.
   The Rev. William Hanly, head of the Irish province of the
Pallottine fathers, said Ryan was expelled for prolonged unlawful
absence from the society and for persistent refusal to comply with
the legitimate instructions of his superiors.
   Ryan, 59, who lives in County Tipperary, did not surface to
respond to the announcement. In the past he has consistently denied
any connection with the outlawed Irish Republican Army or with
guerrilla activities and has denied traveling the world to raise
cash for the IRA.
   His cousin, Tom Ryan, claimed British diplomatic pressure at
Vatican level had prompted the Pallottines' decision.
   ``It was more of a political move than a canonical one,'' he
said.
   The Catholic press office in Dublin said the dismissal meant
that Ryan was effectively suspended from his priestly duties and
could not say Mass, preach or administer the sacraments. The ban
can only be lifted if Ryan finds a bishop willing to receive him
into his diocese, the office added.
   The office said the decision was taken in Rome on Nov. 25 and
was communicated to Ryan who had not replied.
   Church sources said, however, that technically Ryan was still a
priest and could continue to call himself Father Ryan, a colloquial
term, but not ``the reverend.''
   Ryan successfully evaded British efforts to extradite him from
Belgium and the Irish Republic on charges of conspiring to kill and
bomb and possessing explosives in the mid-1970s.
   British authorities claimed Ryan acted on behalf of the outlawed
Irish Republcan Army, which fights British rule in Northern Ireland
and which has carried its struggle to the British mainland.
   After a three-week hunger strike in Belgium to resist
extradition, Ryan in November 1988 was flown to Dublin in a Belgian
military jet.
   Irish Attorney General John Murray turned down an extradition
request on the grounds that Ryan would not get a fair trial in
Britain because of pre-trial publicity.
   When Britain pursued an Irish suggestion that Ryan could be
tried in the republic for offenses allegedly committed in Britain,
the option was ruled out in October by the Irish Director of Public
Prosecutions, Eamon Barnes, on grounds of insufficient evidence.
   Ryan ran unsuccessfully for an Irish seat in the June elections
to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.

<HEAD>AIDS-Infected Doctor Testifies in Her Lawsuit Against Hospital</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 32-year-old doctor suffering from AIDS told a
jury Wednesday how she contracted the fatal disease by pricking her
finger on a hidden needle while cleaning up after another doctor at
a hospital.
   Veronica Prego testified in her $175 million negligence lawsuit
against Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, the other physician _
Dr. Joyce Fogel _ and others.
   Prego remained composed during most of her nearly two hours on
the stand, but sobbed as she described how her mother in Argentina
learned she was hospitalized and rushed to New York to be with her.
   ``I realized there was a very good chance I was going to die,
and I asked a friend who spoke Spanish to call my mother,'' Prego
said.
   Prego said she became seriously ill in November 1987, several
years after pricking her finger with the contaminated needle.
   At the Bronx hospital where she was admitted, Prego said she was
diagnosed with a form of pneumonia ``that really meant AIDS.'' She
told the court that was the first time she learned she had
developed the disease.
   Prego tested positive for the AIDS virus two years earlier, but
medical experts had been unable to tell her if she would come down
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``I was told that I was a carrier of the virus, I was told that
I was at risk. On the other hand, they couldn't tell me if I would
ever get sick,'' she testified, saying that in the early 1980s
little was known about the risks to health-care workers.
   Prego said that on Jan. 12, 1983, she had helped Fogel, an
intern, take a blood sample from an AIDS patient at Kings County,
then cleaned up the soiled gauze and linen.
   ``First I retrieved what I thought were all the needles. Then I
came back to take the refuse that had been left behind,'' she said.
``When I picked up the refuse from the bed, I was stuck by a needle
hidden among the refuse.''
   Prego said she first tried to squeeze blood out of her finger,
then looked for Fogel, who was supervising her.
   ``I was upset and she told me that she understood because it had
happened to her ... She told me she had been reassured there were
no cases where a health-care worker had gotten AIDS this way,''
Prego said.
   Prego maintains in her lawsuit that she was pricked by an
AIDS-infected needle because of improper procedures at the
hospital. She contends Fogel drew blood from an AIDS patient near
death, then carelessly left the needle in a pile of linen and other
waste.
   At the time, Prego, born and educated in Argentina, was working
as an unpaid ``extern,'' a medical-school graduate under a licensed
physician.
   Prego testified she had never heard of AIDS before coming to the
United States in 1982, and was given no official information on
avoiding the disease when she went to work at Kings County.
   Hospital attorneys maintain Prego got the disease through her
own negligence. They say she was later pricked by a second infected
needle and that it was unclear which caused her illness.
   Prego admits the second accident, but her attorneys have said
they will show the initial needle puncture caused her illness.
   In addition to Fogel and the hospital, the lawsuit names the
city Health and Hospitals Corp. and Dr. Sheldon Landesman, an AIDS
specialist Prego says improperly disclosed her illness.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<HEAD>Nominations Due for 32nd Annual Recording Industry Awards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nominees for the 32nd annual Grammy
Awards are likely to be well established artists such as Bette
Midler, Tom Petty and the Rolling Stones rather than from the ranks
of newcomers.
   The nominations were to be revealed Thursday at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel, with Quincy Jones and Olivia Newton John announcing
the honors.
   The Grammy Awards will be presented Feb. 21 at the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles. The three-hour show will be broadcast
live by CBS-TV.
   Almost 7,300 entries in 76 categories were considered for Grammy
nominations. Nearly 6,000 active members of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences were sent nomination ballots in
December.
   The academy voters, like the record-buying public, prefers
recordings of broad appeal over experimental or radically
innovative works, ensuring the bulk of nominations for veterans.
   Last year's ceremony came down to a contest between a sensitive
and challenging work by Tracy Chapman and the upbeat, instantly
likeable ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' by Bobby McFerrin. It was no
contest. ``Don't Worry'' was record of the year and best pop song.
   Leading contenders for this year's nominations were also
familiar and comfortable voices, assuming academy voters stuck with
tradition.
   Veterans likely to win nominations included Midler for her
``Beaches'' movie ballad ``Wind Beneath My Wings''; Linda Ronstadt
for ``Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind''; Tina Turner for
``Foreign Affair,'' and Bonnie Raitt for ``Nick of Time.''
   The Rolling Stones, who have never collected a Grammy, had
another shot at the statuette with their ``Steel Wheels'' album.
   And the all-star lineup of the Traveling Wilburys _ Tom Petty,
George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison _
made the ``Traveling Wilburys'' album a contender for a nomination.
   Petty, with ``Full Moon Fever,'' and Orbison, with ``Mystery
Girl,'' were also good prospects on their own.
   Among fresher faces, academy voters had to consider Janet
Jackson for ``Rhythm Nation 1814''; Fine Young Cannibals for ``The
Raw &amp; the Cooked''; Neneh Cherry for ``Raw Like Sushi,'' and Paula
Abdul for ``Straight Up.''
   Jody Watley, Anita Baker, Prince, Richard Marx, Ziggy Marley and
the group Soul II Soul also were contenders.

   Maynard H. Jackson III, son of Atlanta's mayor,
was arrested on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge after an
auto accident Tuesday afternoon.
   Jackson, 19, was released on his own recognizance after being
booked on a charge of possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana,
said police spokesman Keith Williams.
   Williams said Jackson also would be charged with following too
closely in connection with the auto accident. No injuries were
reported in the rear-end collision.
   If convicted of the marijuana charge, Jackson faces up to a year
in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Mayor Maynard Jackson Jr. issued a statement at city hall saying
he had instructed city officials to treat his son no differently
than any other person.
   The mayor said he loves his son, but said he has made a mistake
and must see it through.

   In another top-level shuffle at struggling CBS,
Barbara Corday resigned Tuesday as the second-in-command of its
entertainment division. She gave no reason, but praised her time at
the network as ``wonderful.''
   Corday, executive vice president of CBS' prime-time programs
division, had been president and chief executive officer of
Columbia-Embassy Television when she joined CBS in August 1988.
   Her resignation is effective immediately, said CBS spokeswoman
Susan Tick in Los Angeles. She said Corday's job won't be filled,
and said she didn't know Corday's future plans.
   Corday's future at CBS had been in question since November, when
then-CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters resigned after only
two years on the job. The two had not been able to pull CBS out of
third in prime time ratings.
   CBS last month named as its new entertainment president Jeff
Sagansky, a former president of Tri-Star Pictures.
   ``I've had a wonderful experience at CBS, and hope that we will
be able to work together in the future,'' Corday said in a
statement.

   Democracy in Latin America is at an all-time
high with strong encouragement coming from the United States, but
American officials acknowledge that only rarely has there been less
support in the hemisphere for U.S. policies on key issues.
   The United States has been in the minority in the last three
weeks on two votes by the Organization of American States
criticizing the U.S. invasion in Panama.
   U.S. officials are worried the drug summit President Bush is
expected to attend next month in Colombia may be overshadowed by
complaints about the more assertive American stance recently.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler conceded Tuesday
that leaks about a proposed U.S. anti-drug interdiction effort off

   The Bush administration's fiscal 1991 budget
will be released later this month without a plan for financing the
bailout of the savings and loan industry, officials say.
   How and when the bailout financing is done will be a crucial,
perhaps the crucial, element in determining how easily the
administration meets the $64 billion deficit target under the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   The administration told the House Ways and Means Committee in
November that it intended by Jan. 15 to formulate a plan to borrow
$50 billion to $100 billion for S&amp;Ls.
   Although officials have narrowed the financing options to just a
few, they will not be able to meet that deadline, three
administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Tuesday.

proclamation and denounce a wave of hate bombings in the South, the
National Urban League released a bleak report on ``the state of
black America.''
   The league proposed cutting the $300 billion defense budget in
half, using $100 billion to cut the deficit and $50 billion to
launch ``an urban Marshall Plan'' to reclaim America's cities and

   ``The end of the Cold War must mean the start of a renewed drive

<HEAD>Indigenous Spiritual Leaders See Abusing Nature As Threat To Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a city dumps its sewage into an adjacent
river, pollution not only affects it but increasingly other cities
down the river. Each adds to the blight. It mounts continually as
the river crawls toward cities ahead.
   ``The people downstream are going to suffer more and more,''
says Chief Oren Lyons, an American Indian spiritual leader, in
sketching that image of the cumulative effects of despoiling nature.
   ``We're going to pay a penalty,'' he added in an interview.
``Only when nations cease building on rivers to use them for sewers
will there be some prospect for cleaner life in the future.''
   He said similar contamination-compounding patterns impair other
environmental processes, dirtying currents of air, leaching the
soil, distorting human ways and harming the stratosphere.
   ``All these currents in the world, the air, the water, the
currents of life on land, the wind, even the earth we travel on,
are moving and they don't recognize any borders,'' he said.
   ``They're a different jurisdiction. It involves everybody.''
   Lyons of Onondaga, N.Y., one of a score of indigenous spiritual
leaders from many lands participating in an international
conference next week in Moscow on protecting the environment, added:
   ``There are natural laws that govern the air, that govern the
land and govern the water, and it behooves us to know what those
laws are if we're going to survive. ... You can't argue with
natural laws. ... If we keep violating them, we won't survive.''
   Lyons, 59, a clan chief of the Onondaga branch of the Iroquois
and director of a native American studies program at the State
University of New York at Buffalo, said Indians are especially
attuned to life's basis in nature.
   ``Indians and other indigenous people have lived in nature,
close to the earth, and understand its wisdom and laws,'' he said.
``That wellspring philosophy needs to be brought to the world.''
   Efforts to do that are planned at a five-day ``Global Forum on
Environment and Development for Survival'' in Moscow Jan. 15-19,
involving religious leaders, legislators and scientists from around
the world.
   Several U.S. Congress members and scientists are among the
approximately 200 registered participants, about 100 representing
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism.
   Approximately a fifth of the religious contingent are indigenous
spiritual leaders of the Americas, Africa, Australia and Pacific
islands, their relatively large representation indicating their
special kinship to the subject.
   ``It's the first time we've been able to get ourselves together
for this broad a representation,'' Lyons said, a member of the
conference steering committee.
   ``Indigenous people have a long-term moral perspective on the
earth and its life. We have no complex answers, but only the simple
principle of respect for all life, for the trees, the rivers, the
fish, the animals.
   ``The world is very complex today, but values still remain
simple, the principles of life remain simple. If we break those
rules of life and procreation, we break the cycle of life and life
will disappear.
   ``The Earth will not disappear, but people will. We're not going
to destroy the world. The world has its own time cycle. But we are
still only a biological experiment.
   ``At one time the Earth had great dinosaurs, but they are not
here any more. It could be that one time people will not be here
anymore. That's up to us, and the directions we take.''
   The Moscow conference opens with an address by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev addresses its closing session.
   It is the second such conference for the New York-based ``Global
Forum''; the first took place in 1988 at England's Oxford
University. In rare partnership, Soviet churches and the first
freely elected Supreme Soviet are co-hosting the current affair.
   Of indigenous spiritual leaders taking part, Lyons said ``our
own territories are small'' but their affinity to nature needs to
``be transferred to the public at large.''
   ``Our ceremonies'' have kept that perspective alive, he said.
``They're engrained as part of life. We celebrate the sacredness of
the earth in a year-round cycle of ceremonies expressing respect
and gratitude for it.''
   Human links with it derive from ``the Creator,'' Lyons said.
``If we go contrary to his rules for it, we're certainly going to
suffer. We don't own the land. We borrow it from the future.
   ``But we are accountable for the future.''
   Time itself is involved, in trees, for example, he said. A chain
saw can cut a 500-year-old tree in 10 minutes, he noted, but
machines can't make another like it grow faster than hundreds of
years.
   ``This is a taking technology without a giving side to it,'' he
said. ``That's what has to be adjusted. People have a voracious
appetite, but they're not exempt from the natural law or its
consequences.''

about 75,000 during 1988, one of the largest loses in a decade of
declines, to 8,940,836, official figures show.
   Figures for 1989 won't be available until late in 1990.

   Leaders of 10 Protestant denominations urge an
end to polarization and sloganeering about abortion, terming it a
complex moral issue that can't be reduced to ``simple rights and
wrongs, pros and cons.''
   In a joint statement initiated by Episcopal Presiding Bishop
Edmond L. Browning, the church leaders said discussion of abortion
should ``encourage sensitive listening to those on all sides'' of
the issue.
   ``We as religious leaders have the insights to offer from our
various faith traditions about both the sacredness of life and the
importance of informed personal conscience that have come out of
years of prayer study and debate,'' they said.
   Although the signers hold differing views of abortion, they said
they were united in a ``deep and abiding reverence for both the
mystery of human life and the freedom of human conscience''
grounded in the nurture of churches.

<HEAD>`The Simpsons,' From the Maker of `Life in Hell,' Offers a Twist
on Cartoons</HEAD>

   Life has never been more normal for the
Simpsons: Dad gives Bronx cheers at the opera, mom hides valuables
in her colossal hairdo and the sluggish son attempts to win
Scrabble games with the word ``kwyjibo.''
   Pushing all of the conventions of the domestic television sitcom
through a paper shredder and then weaving the scraps into new and
often peculiar tales, the makers of Fox's ``The Simpsons'' are
trying to establish the first prime-time cartoon since ``The
Jetsons'' and ``The Bullwinkle Show'' in the early 1960s.
   ``The Simpsons,'' seen regularly as short features on Fox's
``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' debuts as a weekly half-hour series on
Fox on Sunday at 8:30 p.m., replacing the science-themed news show
``Beyond Tomorrow.''
   But don't grab a stack of Pop Tarts and a glass of Tang and
expect Saturday-morning fluff: With episodes focusing on themes
like son Bart's stupidity and dad Homer's inability to provide for
his family, ``The Simpsons'' bears much closer resemblance to Fox's
``Married ... With Children'' than to ``The Smurfs.''
   It might be colorful, but it's a little dark, too.
   ``In my comic strip I'm trying to entertain a certain segment of
the audience and annoy another segment, and I'm not trying to do
that with the TV show,'' said Matt Groening, the show's creator and
the author of the wry and insightful cartoon ``Life in Hell'' and
the related books ``Work is Hell'' and ``Love is Hell.''
   ``I know I can annoy people,'' said Groening (rhymes with
raining, sort of). ``It's more fun to try to take an audience and
make them laugh in spite of themselves. It's a different kind of
challenge. ... This is a family entertainment show. It's not aimed
at kids, though.''
   Groening said ``The Simpsons'' is ``certainly harder-edged than
any TV cartoon in recent memory.'' Which isn't to say it's not
funny in a strange, unpredictable way: When Homer taunts animals at
the zoo, you don't really expect a television show _ much less a
cartoon _ to show dad pelted in the face with monkey muck.
   ``The Simpsons are on the slow side,'' Groening said. ``But one
of the good things about it is that we can resist the temptation to
put clever lines in their mouths. That's my problem with most TV
sitcoms _ these lines that come out of these characters' mouths are
utterly unbelievable. So our cleverness lies elsewhere.
   ``At the same time, I don't think that the show has any of that
superior snottiness. We like the characters ... they make dumb
decisions and they act on whatever emotion occurs to them at the
moment, but that's part of the humor.
   ``The show is ultimately a celebration _ it's about having a
good time.''
   ``The Simpsons'' will have to survive in a television
marketplace where cartoons are either toy-oriented syndicated
strips or huggable Saturday morning specials where a real crisis
occurs when a bear loses his sweater.
   It's a new working environment for Groening, who writes and
draws his comics in his Venice, Calif., home and works on ``The
Simpsons'' on the busy Fox lot.
   ``I got very used to working by myself, but it got lonely,
too,'' Groening said. ``And it's really fun to be around people
having a blast doing what they are doing. Almost all of the
animators are obsessed by the medium _ and they're passionately
enthusiastic about their work when they're not exhausted.''
   The show was created by Groening, and developed by Groening, Sam
Simon and Oscar-winning filmmaker James L. Brooks (``Broadcast
News'').
   ``Life in Hell,'' Groening's weekly comic, is admittedly not a
work of high cartoon art. ``The animators (for `The Simpsons') had
to learn a more primitive way of drawing,'' Groening said.
   ``It was really a struggle a get everybody lined up and facing
the same direction, because every one of the animators can draw
better than I can. There's a simplicity and clarity in the design
of my characters that we wanted to bring to the TV show.
   ``In my comic strip I'm limited, because if I can't draw it, I
won't do it. But with `The Simpsons' I can think up ideas that I
could never draw.''

<HEAD>Industrial Jobs Weakening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's official jobless numbers are
technically accurate but are deceptive, suggesting little change in
the job picture over the past year when the very opposite was true.
   The apparent stability is reflected by the fact that the only
time in 1989 when the civilian rate was more than one-tenth of one
percentage point above or below the 5.3 percent mark was in March,
when it dipped to 5.0 percent.
   But the seeming stability was anything but that, with the number
of factory jobs dropping steadily since early last year. The
decline totaled more than 200,000 by the end of the year _ offset
in statistics by a rise of service workers.
   The trend is is drawing much attention from recession watchers,
who maintain that the erosion of factory and construction jobs
indicates that industrial America may be near or already in
recession.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
indicated the extent of the erosion with a relentless series of
statements in her latest report to Congress, including:
   _Factory job losses continued during December, mainly in the
durable goods industries. Factory job losses now total 195,000
since March.
   _The electrical equipment industry was particularly hard hit in
December, with an employment reduction of nearly 15,000; losses in
this industry since late 1988 total 75,000.
   _Automotive employment, which had been falling recently, was
unchanged in December, but January plant shutdowns already have
been announced. Depending on the length of shutdowns, she said,
they may affect January figures.
   At the same time, the number of paryoll jobs in the so-called
services producing sector _ wholesale trade and finance, insurance,
real estate, transportation and public utilities included _ rose by
200,000 in December.
   Another 85,000 jobs were added in services industries
themselves, mainly in health categories. But employment growth in
retail trade during 1989 was the slowest of any year since the
expansion began in late 1982.
   By some reasoning, service jobs are of equal importance to jobs
in the goods-related sector, but others point out that many service
jobs are directly related to the pace of the industrial sector.
   A downturn in manufacturing, for example, can cause layoffs in
advertising, real estate, transportation and many other service
categories, and can have a quick and severe impact on retail sales
and employment.
   The weakening of goods-related activity, reflected by the
unemployment breakdown, also can be observed in several other
statistical reports.
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. observes that
consumer service spending made up 32 percent of gross national
product in 1988 and 1989. But in much of 1989 it accounted for more
than 45 percent of the change in GNP.
   The decline of strength in the hard goods areas of the economy
doesn't necessarily mean recession. About 2.5 million jobs were
added during 1989, and the proportion of people with jobs was at a
very high 63 percent.
   But continued slippage of jobs in the industrial goods sector of
the economy conceivably could spread to services and then be
reflected in what would appear to be a sudden worsening of the
jobless rate.

   On the first day of school this September,
student Jamil Adams pulled Brother Kenneth Cooper aside for a short
chat.
   ``He says, `Yo, brother, I don't want to be sleeping with the
homeboys at the homeless shelter,''' recalls Cooper, a teacher at
the all-male Rice High School in Harlem.
   But Jamil, one of Rice's 95 seniors, wanted a diploma, so he did
it _ served dinner, washed clothes, cleaned up and stayed over at
the St. Joseph's Shelter for Men. It's part of the Christian
Service Project, a required course in which each Rice senior
performs 65 hours of community service.
   The 15-year-old program has students moving from history class
into homeless shelters and working with the handicapped as part of
their homework.
   ``It makes things very real for the kids. ... The bum on the
corner, the drunk, the junkie _ he's your brother,'' says Cooper.
``The kids find out they're really just broken people in need of
healing. ... They become people instead of faces.''
   More than character building is at work here. Much of the boys'
work is centered in Harlem, where most of them live and all of them
go to school; the aim is to improve their lives and the lives of
their neighbors.
   Last year, seniors ran errands for senior citizens after an
elderly Harlemite was stabbed to death. This year, handicapped kids
at a nearby school are getting hands-on assistance from four Rice
seniors with ``home living skills'' _ using knives, forks and
spoons, tying shoes and putting on clothes. ``It's a good feeling
helping other people in society,'' explained Brock Holloway, 17, of
the Bronx, who's committed himself to working with the physically
impaired children at P.S. 138 in Harlem.
   ``Parents think, `Hey, these kids are doing something positive
instead of running on the street,''' said Holloway before returning
to help the youngsters get into their winter gear at the end of a
school day.
   According to Cooper, a red-bearded man with boundless energy who
has handled the project for three years, it accomplishes something
else: ``It gives the kids a sense of self-worth: `I can make a
difference.'
   ``I like to throw this at them: Mother Teresa was a teen-ager
once. Martin Luther King was a teen-ager once. But they made
choices which led them where they are,'' said Cooper.
   Rice, which 40 years ago was filled with the sons of Irish and
Italian immigrants, has changed along with its surrounding
neighborhood. The student body now is 70 percent black and 30
percent Hispanic.
   Other changes are more obvious: across from the school, crack
and codeine is hawked openly. The brothers, who live in the school
building, have learned to adjust. ``The guy who runs numbers across
the street watches the building,'' joked Brother Myles Amend.
   One block north of this scene, Cooper's boys arrive Tuesday
nights to run the show in the St. Joseph's Shelter at 405 W. 125th
St. They serve dinner, wash clothes for the homeless, spend the
night and serve breakfast.
   Other students take on less challenging tasks: the majority of
seniors return to their grammar schools to work as tutors.
   But three seniors are helping out at a Manhattan center for
infants with AIDS. John Watson spent his first day at the
Incarnation Children's Center playing with one AIDS baby and later
taking the infant to the center's Christmas tree lighting.
   ``He did a great job. It was beautiful to see,'' said Sister
Connie, who runs the center.
   Such praise for the students is not unusual, and the whole
program appears to have a positive effect on them. While the
dropout rate for city high school students stands at 29.7 percent,
Rice graduates virtually all of its students, and 85 percent of
those go on to college, said Amend.
   The message is spreading throughout the city. Each of the 60
high schools run by the Archdiocese of New York now has some form
of community service program, said schools spokeswoman Nora Murphy.
   While the good word is getting around, Brother Kenneth stresses
to his students that it's just as important to keep listening to
the lesson once the 65 hours are completed: ``The world is full of
angry, unhappy, bitter men. We need more saints.''
   While none of them may be quite a saint, the students are taking
the message to heart.
   ``These kids really need help,'' said 16-year-old Elijah Mustafa
on a break from helping handicapped infants develop coordination
skills and strength.
   ``It gets to my heart,'' he said. ``I think about how blessed I
am to be able to walk and talk.''

<HEAD>Volvo 740: Sensible and a Value, Too</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Volvos are sensible. They are known for safety and longevity.
And for 1990, there's a new model in the Volvo 700 series.
   The 1990 Volvo 740 4-door, with no letters to distinguish it
from its more upscale kin, the740 GL, 740 GLE and 740 Turbo, is a
pleasant automobile that retains many important Volvo traits but
leaves out such extras as the sunroof and cruise control. The 740
with manual transmission is base priced at $20,685, at least $1,015
below the other 700 models, and takes the leading price position in
the Swedish car company's 700 lineup.
   The 740 test car, which, with automatic transmission had a base
price of $21,330, performed admirably on winding mountain roads,
its European heritage evident as it easily tackled tough climbs and
took tight turns.
   Indeed, I marveled at the 740's nimble handling since the
Volvo's characteristic shoebox shape does not evoke sporty
performance. But this sensible car makes sense even in demanding
driving conditions.
   And the 740 does it all with a fuel-injected four-cylinder
engine mated with the four-speed automatic transmission.
   The 740 interior was comfortable though not sumptuous, but I
fussed quite a bit with the height of the driver seat since I
seemed to be sitting up rather high to begin with.
   Legroom in back was sufficient if the front seats were pushed
forward somewhat but not exceptional with the seats all the way
back. Rear seat belt buckles stuck up sturdily and were painful
when I tried to slide across the seat.
   Objects destined for the trunk must be lifted up and over the
tail of the car, and the trunk floor had two cut-out areas on
either side of the spare tire so it wasn't flat.
   The trunk did, however, offer an opening through to the back
seat, covered by a plastic panel, to accommodate skis or other long
cargo.
   Fit and finish on the test car was excellent, and I appreciated
the little lights that illuminated the seat belt connections at
night.
   No report on a Volvo could be complete without mention of
safety. Most people have seen commercials showing Volvos taking a
beating without damage to the passenger compartment.
   In a recent study that ranked cars according to the number of
occupants who died in accidents, the 4-door 740s had the lowest
fatality rate for the 1986-88 period.
   The report, by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said
the 740s had 0.6 deaths per 10,000 registered vehicles, compared
with an average for all cars studied of 2 deaths per 10,000.
   For 1990, Volvo says it is making its cars even safer, with
driver-side airbags standard on all models, including the 1990 740.
   Last year's sales of the 740 price leaders, which made their
debut in the fall, totaled 529, Volvo said. Last year was
particularly satisfying for Volvo overall because its U.S. sales of
101,847 were up 4.1 percent from 97,848 in 1988, even as other
European companies struggled to match 1988 sales in last year's
sluggish U.S. market.
   Typical buyers of 740 series cars have been mostly married (89
percent) and aged 35 to 54 years (53 percent). Fifty-four percent
were men, with a median age of 40 and median household income of
$74,550, Volvo said.
   Most were employed in managerial-professional-technical jobs.
   Many buyers are what the company calls Volvophiles, people who
drive their cars for an average 7.3 years. When ranked by the
length of time that owners keep their vehicles, Volvo follows only
Volkswagen (8.6 years) and Mercedes-Benz (8.2 years).
   Consumer Reports magazine notes that 1986-88 Volvo 740s ranked
average or much better than average in owner reports of trouble.
   Competitors of the 740 include Saabs, such as the 900 sedan that
starts at more than $17,000 and the 900S sedan that starts at more
than $21,000, as well as Audis, which start at around $19,000.

<HEAD>Children in Government Testing Program Not Getting AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 children infected with the AIDS
virus are not getting the anti-AIDS drug AZT because they are
subjects in a government trial of another drug.
   The trial of the other drug is continuing, more than two months
after Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan acted to
make AZT widely available to all children who need it. ``We have
enough preliminary evidence that the drug is effective and seems to
be safe,'' he said in October.
   Researchers are split over whether the children should now be
receiving AZT. Some have criticized the decision to continue the
trial with the other drug, called intravenous immunoglobulin, or
IVIG.
   ``The issue of immunoglobulin alone might have been timely three
or four years ago,'' said Dr. Philip Pizzo, chief of the pediatrics
branch at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. ``But in
1989, not having AZT ... means that the potential benefit of the
drug, particularly to children's nervous systems, is being lost.''
   Unlike AZT, which is specifically intended to prevent further
spread of the AIDS virus in the body, immunoglobulin is intended to
reduce the frequency and severity of bacterial infections in
children carrying the AIDS virus. It has no direct effect on the
virus itself.
   In addition, at least half of the AIDS-infected children, those
who are serving as controls in the experiment, are receiving only a
placebo, lacking any beneficial ingredients. They are not getting
any drugs.
   Such placebo-controlled trials have been stopped in adults
because it was deemed unethical to deny adults AZT, said
spokeswoman Elaine Baldwin at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda.
   NIAID, which runs nearly all of the national trials of potential
anti-AIDS drugs, has also stopped doing placebo-controlled trials
in children, Baldwin said.
   ``The bottom line from my point of view is that a
placebo-controlled trial to be done in children with symptomatic
infections would be an inappropriate thing to do,'' said Pizzo.
``AZT is a drug which has clearly defined benefits in the pediatric
population.''
   His studies, among the most thorough studies of AZT in children,
indicate the drug can stop or even reverse damage to the central
nervous system. That damage produces physical and mental symptoms.
   ``Children who were once walking lose that ability, or children
who had sentences begin to lose that speech,'' he said. ``AZT can
improve that in varying degrees.''
   A number of specialists in the treatment of AIDS in children
hold similar views, as they explained in interviews:
   _ ``We all feel that survival in children given no drug is very
poor. The fact that symptomatic children can now be treated with
AZT is certainly a significant advance,'' said Dr. Gwendolyn Scott,
a pediatrician at the University of Miami School of Medicine.
   _ ``AZT has been demonstrated to have benefit in children, and
patients need to have access to AZT,'' said Dr. Edward Connor,
chairman of the pediatrics committee of the AIDS Clinical Trials
Group operated by NIAID.
   _ ``The question for children who fall into that category is not
so much will AZT be of benefit, but what is the best dosage,'' said
Dr. Stephen Spector, director of the AIDS clinical trials unit at
the University of California, San Diego. He added that AZT is
likely to be useful even in children who have not yet developed
symptoms of AIDS.
   In October, HHS Secretary Sullivan and the Food and Drug
Administration released AZT for use in children under what is
called a ``treatment IND.'' That allows wide distribution of a
drug, without charge, before it has been formally approved for use.
The FDA determined that the benefits of the toxic drug outweighed
its side effects.
   As of Nov. 30, 1989, the latest date for which figures are
available, the Centers for Disease Control had received reports of
1,947 cases of children with AIDS and 1,059 deaths since the
epidemic began.
   The CDC has no estimate of the number of American children
infected with the AIDS virus, but doctors say the number may be two
to 10 times the number of cases reported. Most contract the virus
from their mothers before birth.
   Children in the immunoglobulin trial are not prevented from
taking AZT, but few are receiving it. The trial's director, Dr.
Anne Willoughby of the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development in Bethesda, said 347 children are in the trial.
   Of those, 113 are seriously ill, and 26 of them are getting AZT.
Among the remaining 234 patients, five are getting AZT. The
children are being treated at more than two dozen centers across
the country, Willoughby said.
   Researchers are continuing to recruit less seriously ill
children for the trial, she said.
   ``There is a legitimate difference of opinion about the status
of this study,'' Willoughby said in a telephone interview. She said
she would like to see more data on the trials of AZT in children
before she was convinced of its effectiveness.
   Keith Krasinski, a pediatrician at New York University Medical
Center and a participant in the immunoglobulin trial, said, ``It
would be premature to say that AZT is the standard of therapy.''
Information on its safety and the method of its action has
increased in recent months, ``but data on the efficacy of AZT in
children has accumulated more slowly,'' he said.
   Willoughby emphasized that the study's data safety and
monitoring board, an independent group that could halt the trial if
it were considered unethical, has repeatedly approved its
continuation.
   The most recent such approval by that group was about three
weeks ago, Willoughby said. ``We have subjected it to ruthless
scrutiny by outside groups,'' she said. The study's own executive
committee also reviewed the trial Jan. 8 and made no substantial
changes, she said.
   Furthermore, she said, the children in the trial can be given
AZT if their physicians think it's appropriate; she acknowledged
this might complicate evaluation of the study.
   Willoughby said she is less certain than Pizzo of the value of
AZT in children. ``It's not as clear to many other people as it is
to Phil,'' she said.
   NIAID has begun a separate trial in which all the children
receive either immunoglobulin with AZT or AZT alone. That study
should be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of intravenous
immunoglobulin while at the same time providing AZT to all
participants, authorities say.
   The study will, however, require more children to demonstrate
whether immunoglobulin is effective, said Dr. Arthur Amman,
chairman of the scientific advisory committee of the American
Foundation for AIDS Research. ``That makes the studies much more
difficult,'' he said.
   The reason, Amman explained, is that the control subjects will
improve with doses of AZT, and that will narrow the noticeable
differences between them and the group getting AZT and
immunoglobulin.
   Researchers are unsure of the value of immunoglobulin, said
Spector of the University of California, San Diego.
   ``There really is no good data,'' he said. ``There is subjective
data that it may be of benefit, but well-controlled, systematic
studies haven't been done.''
   One of its earliest proponents was Dr. Arye Rubinstein of the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who is
participating in the immunoglobulin trial directed by Willoughby.
   ``There is no question it reduces infection,'' Rubinstein said.
``It doesn't cure the disease, but it improves the outcome.''

<HEAD>Reapportionment Puts Focus on Three Sunbelt Governors Races</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control of the political map of the 1990s is
riding on the outcome of governors races this year and Republicans
are running scared in the states where the stakes are highest.
   Democrats and Republicans, anticipating that the 1990 Census
will confirm the shift of Americans to the South and West, are
concentrating much of their attention and resources on three big
Sunbelt states where governors will play a crucial role in drawing
lines for a bonanza of new House seats.
   Democrats now hold 29 of the 50 governors offices, including 20
of the 36 up this year. But in the three biggest Sunbelt states _
California, Texas and Florida _ sure to be the big winners when
U.S. House seats are shifted to reflect the 1990 Census, the
governors are Republicans and the GOP is marshaling its resources
for an all-out effort to maintain its control.
   That task is complicated by the fact that Govs. George
Deukmejian of California and William Clements of Texas are not
seeking re-election, and Gov. Bob Martinez of Florida has had a
rocky first term.
   ``The real battleground is reapportionment,'' said Michele
Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
``That's where we hope to put the majority of our resources to help
break the hold the Democrats have on the U.S. Congress.''
   State legislatures will draw new congressional and legislative
district lines _ subject to the governors' vetos _ that will define
politics for the next decade.
   Current projections are that 18 House seats will shift to
Sunbelt states with California gaining seven, Florida four and
Texas three. Democrats control the legislatures in all three, which
makes the governorships crucial to Republican chances to influence
the drawing of lines in those states.
   The biggest loser in the reapportionment sweepstakes looks like
New York with a projected loss of three House seats. Democratic
Gov. Mario Cuomo is expected to seek a third term, but Republicans
control the state Senate which will give them a voice when the
lines are redrawn.
   Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois is another Republican who is
retiring. His state stands to lose two House seats and the
Democrats currently control both branches of the legislature.
   Republican analysts acknowledge they may suffer some net losses
in the governor's races, and they would be satisifed to keep the
states they have.
   Davis said she expects President Bush to make 10 or more
campaign appearances for GOP candidates for governor, noting that
Reagan campaigned for only three gubernatorial candidates four
years ago.
   Bush plans to attend a fund-raising dinner Friday in Miami for
Martinez.
   Besides Martinez, Republicans view Gov. Kay Orr of Nebraska, as
their most endangered incumbent. Among Democrats, William O'Neill
in Connecticut and Neil Goldschmidt in Oregon are regarded as
facing tough re-election challenges.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis' retirement in Massachusetts has left a
confusing free-for-all in both parties. The 1988 presidential
candidate's popularity has plummeted along with the state's
economy, and Republicans are voicing rare optimism about their
prospects in a normally Democratic stronghold.
   Rough Democratic primaries are expected in Georgia where Gov.
Joe Frank Harris is retiring and Ohio where Gov. Richard Celeste
cannot seek a third term. Ohio stands to lose two seats while
Georgia gains one.
   In California, Republicans grabbed an early advantage when Sen.
Pete Wilson decided to run for governor. He has a clear path to the
nomination while Democrats face a potentially bitter and expensive
primary between state Attorney General John Van de Kamp and former
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
   Republicans say that if Van de Kamp is the Democratic nominee,
they'll make an issue of his reluctance as a local prosecutor to
bring a case against a suspect in the Hillside Strangler case,
reasoning there wasn't enough evidence. The state later stepped in
and won a conviction.
   ``They've got a silver bullet'' issue, said Charles Cook,
analyst and editor of a Washington political newsletter.
   Adding a new dimension to many of the governor's races is the
battle over abortion. The Supreme Court's 1989 decision giving
states more leeway to regulate abortion has given the issue a new
relevancy in many states.
   In the aftermath of 1989 victories by abortion-rights
candidates, several 1990 candidates have moved away from
anti-abortion positions _ such as Democratic hopefuls Anthony
Celebrezze in Ohio and Neil Hartigan in Illinois, and Republicans
Jack Rains and Tom Luce in Texas.
   Early television advertising has boosted the candidacies of
Rains and Luce in Texas, and put the early Republican frontrunner,
abortion opponent Kent Hance, on the defensive. Among Democrats,
state Treasurer Ann Richards faces a field including former
governor Mark White and Attorney General Jim Mattox.
   Some of Martinez' problems in Florida stem from his failed
attempt to win restrictions on abortion from his state legislature
in a special session last fall. Democratic Rep. Bill Nelson has
become the leading Democratic candidate, running as an advocate of
abortion rights.
   In Pennyslvania, Democratic incumbent Bob Casey is an abortion
foe, while the front-runner for the Republican nomination to
challenge him, Barbara Hafer, supports abortion rights.
   With most governors elected for four-year terms, this class of
governors was last up in 1986. That was the year Republicans scored
a major eight-seat gain in governorships _ at a time when they were
losing control of the U.S. Senate.
   The Republicans have lost ground in governors races since then.
But the 1986 results demonstrated that governors elections can run
counter to national trends.
   Both parties have national efforts aimed at assisting their
gubernatorial candidates. Republicans hope to raise and spend $1.5
million to $2 million nationally this year assisting governor
candidates. Democrats last month announced a $3 million goal for
their Project 500 campaign to help candidates for state
legislatures and governorships, in addition to a half million
dollars or more their Democratic Governors Association will spend.

<HEAD>Exxon: Refinery Worker Twice Restarted Flow Through Leaking
Pipeline</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Retransmitting to make slug conform to general news wires</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Exxon refinery operator twice restarted
the flow of oil through a leaking pipeline after automatic safety
systems stopped the flow, the company said in its first public
report on a 567,000-gallon spill.
   And in a private briefing for New York and New Jersey
environmental officials, Exxon officials disclosed that a system to
detect leaks in the pipeline had been faltering at least once or
twice a week for a year, a New York official said Tuesday.
   ``It seems that's the reason why the operator overrode the
system,'' said Carol Ash, a regional director of the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation. She would not elaborate.
   Exxon now says the Jan. 2 leak spilled 567,000 gallons of home
heating oil into the Arthur Kill shipping channel between the New
York City borough of Staten Island and New Jersey, Exxon said in a
summary of an internal report.
   Exxon initially said it had lost only 5,000 gallons.
   The report did not say how much more oil leaked because the
operator restarted the pipeline, but Joe McMillan, a company vice
president, defended the worker's actions.
   The company summary did not mention the faulty leak-detection
system; McMillan said only that the operator, whom he would not
identify, had noticed ``erratic'' signals from one system that
detected the leak after a malfunction in an automatic valve and
meter disabled another shutdown system.
   ``We're still trying to chase down the erratic signals,'' he
said.
   McMillan said the operator restarted the pipeline because the
system appeared to be normal on pipeline monitors. Typically, he
said, a plant operator restarts the flow of oil after a shutdown to
confirm there is a problem.
   McMillan said the plant operator did not get a confirmation of
the problem each of the three times that he restarted the system.
The third time, however, he decided against resuming the flow of
oil.
   The oil oozed through a gash in an underwater pipeline for six
hours before the pipeline was finally shut down, the summary said.
The cause of the crack hasn't been determined, and Exxon plans to
remove the pipeline next week for metallurgical testing.
   Ash complained that Exxon's safety procedures ``don't even begin
to meet the basic housekeeping needs of a major organization that's
passing this much oil from one facility to another under a
metropolitan water body.''
   The pipeline runs beneath the Arthur Kill between Exxon's Bayway
Refinery in Linden and a company distribution terminal in Bayonne.
   McMillan said the internal report, released to state and federal
investigators, is preliminary.
   The summary, released a week after the spill, ended corporate
silence that public officials had criticized as stonewalling.
   A New Jersey grand jury is investigating Exxon for possible
violations of the state ocean-pollution law in the spill, which
fouled ecologically sensitive marshland, killed at least 150 birds
and partially closed the shipping channel.
   Exxon also was involved in the nation's largest oil spill, the
grounding last March of the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska, in which
more than 10 million gallons of crude spilled.

   Robert T. Morris spent weeks trying to
perfect the program that crippled a national computer network and
used code to hide his work, a Cornell University computer security
official testified.
   Morris is on trial in federal court, where his attorney
contended in opening arguments Tuesday that the suspended Cornell
graduate student simply made a ``mistake'' while experimenting with
a program to test computer security.
   Testimony was not scheduled to resume until Thursday because the
courtroom was reserved for an unrelated hearing today.
   Dean Krafft, director of computer facilities for Cornell's
computer science department, testified Tuesday that he found forms
of the ``worm'' or ``virus'' program existed in Morris' Cornell
computer account as early as Oct. 15, 1988.
   Krafft said those files were hidden so they would remain
undiscovered in a normal search of computer files. He said he
uncovered them during an exhaustive search of all computer science
department files during an investigation after the Nov. 2, 1988
network disruption.
   ``They were encrypted and in compressed form to keep somebody
else from reading them,'' said Krafft, who said such storage of a
file was unusual.
   Included in those secretive files were the decrypted passwords
of 73 other computer users at Cornell, he said. He said he also
found password files from the University of California-Berkeley,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University in
Morris' Cornell account.
   The final worm program stored in Morris' account on Nov. 2 took
two days to decode and an additional week to translate, Krafft
testified.
   Morris, 25, of Arnold, Md., is the first person brought to trial
under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. If convicted, he faces
up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Prosecutors allege Morris designed and unleashed a program that
replicated wildly, immobilizing an estimated 6,000 computers linked
to the Internet research network, including computers of NASA, the
Air Force and several universities.
   Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni did not argue that Morris
wasn't responsible for the worm program. ``He made a critical
mistake and it caused the virus to spread much faster than he
anticipated,'' Guidoboni said.
   ``This worm caused no permanent damage and it was not designed
to cause permanent damage,'' he told the jury.
   U.S. Justice Department attorney Mark Rasch argued that the
program was intended as a ``full-scale assault on computers
throughout the United States launched by Morris.''
   Morris ``devoted a lot of time, energy and research to planning
this assault'' from his computer at Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y., Rasch
said.
   Rasch said the worm was designed to break into as many computers
as possible and was programmed with many different ways to
accomplish its goal.

<HEAD>Wide-Body Passenger Jet Ready for Test Flight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The MD-11, a new wide-body jetliner from
McDonnell Douglas, is ready to fly for the first time, carrying the
aerospace company's hopes of regaining preeminence in commercial
aircraft production into the next century.
   The first new tri-jet introduced since the Douglas DC-10 and
Lockheed L-1011 two decades ago, the MD-11 was poised for its
initial flight today if the weather was good at Long Beach Airport.
   The 350-passenger MD-11 is just one of several aircraft programs
on which the St. Louis-based aerospace and defense company has run
behind schedule, including the 150-passenger MD-80 jetliner and the
C-17 military cargo plane.
   Many of McDonnell Douglas' problems stem from the worldwide boom
in aircraft orders, which also has overtaxed production at Boeing,
this country's No. 1 commercial aircraft producer.
   The MD-11 is ``quite important to McDonnell Douglas,'' said
Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst with Bateman Eichler Hill
Richards brokerage in Los Angeles.
   ``The successful certification of the MD-11 will generate a
significant portion of Douglas' revenues over the next several
years,'' Harris said.
   The company has 118 orders and 194 options for MD-11s, which
Harris said will cost about $90 million apiece. Under the most
optimistic schedule, the company could have the plane tested,
approved and 10 jets delivered by the end of the year, he said.
   The maximum nonstop range for the standard MD-11 is up to 8,039
land miles with 323 passengers and luggage.
   The planes are powered by the quieter, more energy efficient
high-bypass engines made by General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt
&amp; Whitney. Customers will be able to choose the maker.
   The MD-11 is about as long as two-thirds of a football field,
and several companies have expressed interest in a stretch version
that would be 35 feet longer, about the size of a Boeing 747. No
decision has been made on whether to produce the longer version,
said Douglas spokesman Keith Takahashi.
   The MD-11 looks much the same from the outside as the DC-10,
although minor streamlining changes have been made in the tail, the
end of the wings and the stabilizers. The avionics, or electronic
equipment, cockpit and interior are new.
   It will compete against the A-330 and A-340 jetliners being
manufactured by the European consortium Airbus Industrie, which
also carry about 350 passengers and cost about the same. Boeing's
777, to be introduced in the mid-1990s, will also compete with the
MD-11s.
   ``McDonnell Douglas is counting on the Douglas unit to generate
profit growth in the years ahead because of the likelihood of a
flattening defense budget and the significant commercial backlog
that exists for both the MD-80 and the MD-11,'' said Harris.
   He said 1990 would be a transitional year for McDonnell Douglas,
whose earnings fell during the first nine months of fiscal 1989.
   ``It's still an open question as to how many (MD-11s) can be
delivered, and the bottom line will be affected by development
expense,'' which could rise if test flights reveal serious
problems, Harris said.
   The program for the smaller MD-80 appears to have ``turned the
corner'' into profitability, he said.
   Meanwhile, the C-17 program is still in development amid close
scrutiny. The Air Force recently moved the first flight of the C-17
fron the end of this year to mid-1991.
   ``By 1991, of course, the MD-11 would be working its way to a
higher production rate, the MD-80 would be contributing profit, and
we'll have a clearer picture of how the C-17 is doing,'' Harris
said.

   Greeting card giant Hallmark Cards Inc.
said it has bought back $289 million of its own stock from the Hall
family and from the company's employee profit-sharing and ownership
plan.
   The stock was bought Dec. 28 with ``available corporate cash
reserves,'' Hallmark spokesman Steve Doyal said Tuesday.
   The shares were repurchased so the employee plan would have
enough cash to pay for future retirements, Doyal said.
   Hallmark bought about $190 million worth of stock from the Hall
family and about $99 million from the employee plan. Hallmark, a
private company, would not disclose the number of shares it
purchased, or the number of shares owned by the family or the
employee plan.
   The Hall family, descendants of company founder Joyce C. Hall,
owns two-thirds of the company's stock and the employee plan owns
the other third.

<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent headlines about declining interest rates
have posed a question in the minds of many American homeowners: Is
it time to refinance the mortgage?
   The reduction early this week in the bank prime lending rate
from 10.5 percent to 10 percent stirred new interest in the
subject, even if only in a symbolic way.
   Moves in the prime usually come as an after-the-fact response to
changes in other short-term interest rates, and may have very
little bearing on what lenders charge for long-term loans such as
fixed mortgages.
   Still, fixed 30-year mortgages are being offered in some places
these days with interest rates a bit under 10 percent, down about a
percentage point of where they stood a year ago.
   And many analysts in the chancy business of making financial
forecasts hold out hope that interest rates in general may keep
coming down in the months ahead.
   That's more than enough to pique the curiosity of anyone who
would like to lighten the burden of the monthly mortgage bill _ or
to refinance for any one of a dozen or more worthy reasons.
   ``For most families, the mortgage on their home is their largest
single debt,'' points out the United &amp; Babson Investment Report, a
Boston-based financial advisory service.
   The most prominent obstacle to refinancing is the cost of
replacing one loan with another, which can run to several thousand
dollars by the time such charges as legal and application fees,
appraisals and ``points'' on a new mortgage are added up.
   Before the merits of any refinancing deal can be evaluated, a
complete list of these costs must be compiled.
   The total can then be divided by the amount you would save
monthly on mortgage payments to determine the ``payback period'' _
the amount of time it would take you to recover your refinancing
costs.
   For example, United &amp; Babson says, a refinancing that incurs
$6,000 in costs and saves you $50 a month in mortgage payments will
take 120 months, or 10 years, to reach the breakeven point. Not
much of a bargain.
   By contrast, a switch that costs $2,000 and saves you $175 a
month requires just 12 months to start paying off.
   Experts warn, however, that even the latter example may not be
quite as attractive as it sounds. They point out that the
government subsidizes mortgage payments through interest deductions
that can amount to well over 30 percent of the total, when both
federal and state income taxes are considered.
   Refinancing costs, by contrast, aren't usually deductible as
current expenses. On a typical new loan, for example, any up-front
points you pay must be spread out for tax purposes over the life of
the mortgage, unless the proceeds of the loan go directly for
capital improvements to your property.
   Refinancing appeals to large numbers of homeowners for reasons
apart from reducing monthly payments. It may be used, for example,
to substitute a 15-year mortgage for one with 20 or 25 years still
to run.
   That allows for faster buildup of equity in the property, and
cuts the total interest cost by thousands of dollars over the life
of the loan.
   Also, noted Niel Moser, an official at a mortgage affiliate of
the Credit Union National Association, even in cases where the
monthly savings aren't much, ``some people are switching from
adjustable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to get the
security of a known payment schedule.''

   The stock market gave ground today in a
carryover of selling from Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.76 to 2,760.24
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 364 up, 629 down and
475 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.35 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were disappointed by the market's
performance over the past several sessions since it began the new
year with a sharp rise to a record high in the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   Some observers argue that hopes for an early-1990 rally had been
running so high that they left stocks vulnerable to a letdown.
   Wall Street also was bracing uneasily for corporate
fourth-quarter earnings reports due out over the next few weeks.
   Profit projections for the period have been coming down steadily
as evidence accumulated that the pace of business activity was
sluggish at best.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors fell &rsqb; to 43{;
McDonald's dropped \ to 33&rsqb;; Philip Morris lost \ to 40, and
General Electric was unchanged at 64|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .40 to 192.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .35 at 380.09.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 28.37 to
2,766.00.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 548 rising, 959 falling and 461 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 155.21 million shares, against 140.11
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Canadian Pacific Wins Bid to Buy Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of the bankrupt Delaware &amp;
Hudson Railway to Canadian Pacific Ltd. is expected to add
stability to the nation's oldest continually operated railroad,
officials and rail employees said.
   Canadian Pacific's bid to buy the D&amp;H for $35 million beat out
five other bidders, including Cooperstown, N.Y.-based Delaware
Otsego Corp., which has been operating the D&amp;H for the last 18
months through its New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railroad
subsidiary.
   Canadian Pacific is the third largest corporation in Canada. The
company's rail unit, CP Rail, provides transcontinental service in
Canada and uses the D&amp;H as its main link to the northeastern United
States.
   Francis P. Dicello, the Washington, D.C., attorney appointed
trustee of the D&amp;H, announced his selection Tuesday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
   Dicello, appointed last year by the court to oversee the D&amp;H,
said in a statement that CP Rail will bring long-term stability and
well recognized rail expertise to the D&amp;H. He said ``public
interest considerations weighed heavily in the selection of CP
Rail.''
   Dicello's decision must be approved by the court and is subject
to conditions that must also meet the approval of Conrail, the
Federal Railway Administration and the states of New York and
Pennsylvania.
   Dicello said the bankruptcy court will hold a hearing Feb. 9 to
determine whether to approve the sale. If the court approves the
sale and agreements are reached with the D&amp;H's collective
bargaining units, the deal then goes to the Interstate Commerce
Commission for approval, he said.
   The whole process could take from six months to a year, Dicello
said.
   ``I'm optimistic'' about getting the required approvals, but
``they aren't guaranteed by any means,'' he said.
   Dicello said the sale price was ``$35 million plus other
considerations.''
   ``Their offer in terms of dollars was competitive,'' Dicello
said. ``They bring a lot of railroad experience. They are
structured to put traffic on the railroad, which is badly needed.''
   Walter Rich, president of Delaware Otsego, said, ``although we
are disappointed that our proposal has been accepted we are pleased
that the CP...has been chosen to complete the job we started.''
   Guilford Transportation Industries of Billerica, Mass., was also
a bidder. Guilford bought the D&amp;H in 1984 but filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1988, after which the
federal Interstate Commerce Commission designated the NYS&amp;W to run
the railway.
   Other bidders included the D&amp;H Railway Acquisition Corp. of
Phoenixville, Pa., Railport Inc. of Philadephia and the D&amp;H Group
Inc. of New York City.
   The 167-year-old D&amp;H, begun in 1823 as a canal company, is the
nation's oldest continually operating rail company. It employs
nearly 700 people and operates from Albany to Montreal and
southwest to Binghamton, through Pennsylvania to Virginia. Its
1,600 miles of track includes a line from Binghamton to Buffalo.
   ``It sounds good to me,'' said Dick Bryant, a D&amp;H carman from
Laurens, N.Y., of Tuesday's announcement. ``I think they'll do more
for us _ keep more men working.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet and East European officials, split
over the pace of economic reform, today reached broad agreement to
move their Comecon trading bloc toward world markets after four
decades of isolation.
   ``A 40-year period is coming to an end,'' said Bulgarian Premier
Georgi Atanassov, wrapping up the two-day summit. ``This meeting
marks a real new beginning.''
   Officials indicated that the agreement would reduce Soviet
dominance in trading with Eastern European countries as the former
Soviet satellites abandon the centralized, five-year plans that
were the bulwark of Stalinist economic management.
   Under the agreement, trade between the nations will gradually
shift to a hard currency basis at prices set by the world market.
   Few details emerged of the agreement, and it was not clear how
many years it will take for the shift to be completed.
   A Bulgarian official said he believed that it will take three to
five years to move from current trading practices, based on barter
and artificial currency exchange rates, to a new system based on
world prices.
   ``We have reached a substantial agreement,'' said Vladimir
Dlouhy, the chairman of Czechoslovakia's state planning commission.
   The Soviet Union on Tuesday proposed that the new system start
operating from 1991, with trading pegged to a hard currency rate
and to world market prices. But East Europeans dependent for
decades on Soviet fuel and energy supplies suggested that such a
quick transition would be a disaster.
   The next Comecon meeting will be in Budapest, officials said.
But no date was set, and Czechoslovak officials said their call for
a summit as soon as June to speed reform was rebuffed.
   Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland had led forces demanding a
radical restructuring of the Soviet-dominated alliance.
   They claim decades of adherence to Soviet-style central planning
has crippled their economies, making them more difficult to shift
to a market economy, and they demanded compensation by the Soviets.
   The Comecon alliance has used the Soviet ruble as the basis for
transactions for all its 40 years. The ruble is a soft,
non-convertible currency, meaning it is not exchanged on Western
markets, and it is governed by strict rules and controlled by the
Soviet government.
   Hard currencies such as the dollar and the Japanese yen have
their value determined on markets.
   In Comecon's early years, the arrangement allowed the Soviet
Union to force its Eastern European satellites into trade relations
highly favorable to Moscow. The alliance also cut those countries
off from Western markets and technology, a situation that has left
their debt-ridden economies lagging far behind the West and their
products far inferior in quality.
   It was Comecon's first gathering since authoritarian one-party
Communist rule lost its grip in Eastern Europe, beginning with
Poland last summer and most recently with the bloody December
revolution that toppled Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Delegations from all the Warsaw Pact countries were led by
premiers including Nikolai Ryzhkov of the Soviet Union. Like Petre
Roman of Romania, some have been in office for just a matter of
weeks.
   Dlouhy told the gathering Tuesday that his country, the world's
10th largest economic power before World War II, ``had regressed''
because of its membership in an alliance created by Josef Stalin as
a means to exploit and maintain control over client states in
Eastern Europe.
   He, like his Polish and Hungarian colleagues, contended it was
the Soviet Union's moral responsibility to share the costs of the
painful transition to trade relations based on Western hard
currencies.
   Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's finance minister, said Tuesday
that Prague was considering resigning from some ``restrictive''
Comecon commissions like one that fixes currency exchange rates
among its members, who also include Bulgaria, East Germany,
Vietnam, Mongolia and Cuba.
   Czechoslovakia maintained at the opening meeting that a
transition period of two to four years was needed to introduce free
market prices in the bloc.

<HEAD>Northwest Warns Workers About Concerns Over Noise Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move to block additional noise
restrictions at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport,
Northwest Airlines has warned employees that jobs will be lost if
the airline can't use older, noisier planes until it gets new,
quieter models.
   In a three-page letter dated Jan. 3, Northwest urges employees
to contact Minneapolis City Council Member Steve Cramer, whom it
calls ``particularly vocal on the current noise issue.''
   The letter asks the employees to tell Cramer in their own words:
   ``You are a Northwest employee. You live in Minneapolis.
Aircraft noise is a price we pay to live near an airport.
Unreasonable noise restrictions limiting the use of certain
aircraft like the DC9-40 will hurt Northwest, its employees and the
local economy. Let's work together to address noise concerns.''
   The letter also urges Northwest employees to contact Cramer
before a Jan. 23 meeting of the Metropolitan Aircraft Sound
Abatement Council, at which Northwest is expected to ask the
council to approve the use of about 14 older and nosier airplanes
until Northwest can take delivery on new and quieter planes over
the next 10 years.
   The letter noted that some of Cramer's constituents live under
flight paths and have complained about noise.
   ``But hundreds of Mr. Cramer's constituents are Northwest
employees like you,'' the letter says. ``These employees'
livelihoods could be adversely affected by restrictions on
Northwest's fleet operations. Mr. Cramer needs to be reminded that
Northwest employees are also his constituents. ... Your job could
be threatened by the actions of Mr. Cramer and other MASAC (Sound
Abatement Council) members.''
   The letter is signed by Tim Thornton, Northwest's executive vice
president and general counsel; Greg Averill and H.T. Dodge, vice
chairmen of the local unit of the Air Line Pilots Association; Guy
Cook, president of District Lodge 143 of the International
Association of Machinists, and Bruce Retrum, secretary-treasurer of
Teamsters Local 2747.
   Cramer, a Minneapolis representative on the Sound Abatement
Council, said Northwest's letter ``underscores an apparent new
confrontational approach that they are taking, which I don't think
in the end will be productive.''
   He also said that if Northwest asks the council to endorse the
use of the older planes, he will vote against it.
   ``That's like asking people to endorse being hit over the head
with a baseball bat,'' Cramer said.
   Being formed is a committee that would propose policies to
increase the use of newer, quieter planes at the airport. The
committee is expected to study ordinances that would require
airlines to use a certain percentage of quieter planes.

<HEAD>Taiwan-U.S. Trade Talks End Without Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Taiwan officials ended three days
of trade talks Wednesday without reaching agreement on U.S.
requests for Taiwan to further open its markets.
   Sandy Kristoff, assistant U.S. trade representative, said the
American delegation was disappointed at Taiwan's refusal to end
import bans on high-value U.S. agricultural products and alcoholic
beverages and its restrictions on U.S. insurance firms.
   Kristoff, head of the American delegation, said in a statement
that her delegation also was concerned about the slow progress
Taiwan has made in the protection of intellectual property rights.
   Although Taiwan signed an agreement last year to regulate the
showing of pirated U.S. films in popular video parlors, she said,
``implementation and enforcement efforts have not been as rigorous
as expected.''
   But Sheu Ke-sheng, director general of Taiwan's Board of Foreign
Trade, told reporters Taiwan must avoid opening its market too
rapidly to avoid causing harm to local companies.
   Kristoff said Taiwan had made ``overall progress'' on the
implementation of a four-year action plan to reduce its trade
surplus with the United States.
   Under the plan, Taiwan proposed to reduce its trade surplus by
at least 10 percent each year and cut import tariffs to an average
7 percent in 1992.
   Taiwan cut import tariffs on more than 4,500 items last year
under U.S. pressure and the rates average about 9.65 percent now.

<HEAD>EC Sues West Germany for Failure to Comply with Water Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EC Commission Wednesday decided to
take West Germany to court for failing to comply with European
Community water standards.
   Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC commissioner for the environment,
said that Bonn had failed to ``fully and properly take account of
European Community rules on drinking water.''
   The Commission said in a statement it had filed a case against
the West German government at the European Court of Justice. The
Luxembourg-based court is empowered to levy heavy fines against EC
nations which fail to respect EC legislation. Its rulings are
binding.
   The Commission had been considering what to do about West
Germany's continuing failure to clean up its drinking water, eight
years after it should have complied with EC legislation.
   Most of the 12 EC member states should have cleaned up their
drinking water to meet EC standards by 1982, with some being given
a 1985 deadline.
   West Germany only began to modify its national water legislation
to comply with the EC rules in 1986 and gave itself until October
1989 to comply with the ceiling on pesticide levels in drinking
water.
   West Germany is the fourth EC nation to be taken to court over
failure to meet EC drinking water standards. The case against
Britain was brought on Sept. 20, 1989 and cases against Belgium and
France were filed previously.
   The Commission should soon decide whether to take similar action
against Luxembourg and proceedings are pending against Italy and
Spain.

<HEAD>Woman Wins $9 Million in Lawsuit; Jury Decides Age Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than $9 million in damages has been awarded
to a Texas woman by a federal court jury who found that Xerox Corp.
discriminated against her because of her age.
   The jury on Tuesday awarded Elizabeth Layman $284,000 in actual
damages and $8.75 million in punitive damages, concluding that
Xerox has fraudulently induced Ms. Layman to relocate to California
and then refused to provide her a job.
   Xerox said it will ask U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater to
overturn the verdict. If he refuses, it will appeal.
   ``We do not believe the evidence supports the jury's verdict,
and the size of the damages are grossly disproportionate to the
claimed wrong,'' said Tom Abbott, manager of public relations at
the company's headquarters in Stamford, Conn.
   According to her lawsuit, Ms. Layman, now 46, was a software
marketing manager at a Xerox office in Dallas for about six years
until her job was eliminated in a general reorganization shortly
after she turned 40 in 1983.
   She was demoted to a lower-grade job, but within a year, her
suit claims, a younger woman was named to fill her former position.
   In 1986, the suit said, her entire unit was disbanded, and she
was told she could transfer to a Xerox office in California.
Although the company bought her house, the suit said the job offer
did not come through until after she had filed suit, and then was
for an entry-level position.
   When she refused the transfer, she was fired.
   Attorney Grady Swindle said the verdict shows ``you're entitled
to be treated fairly even after age 40.''
   Swindle said the large jury award means ``that employers should
not take the prime use of employees and then dump them out of a
company.''
   The jury award also includes $145,000 in back pay and lost
benefits, and $139,716 in compensation for the trouble Ms. Layman
had after the sale of her house.

<HEAD>Trade Rep: Farmers Must Learn to Live Without Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers, including those who grow Florida
citrus, must learn to live without subsidies and import tariffs in
the coming years, U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills told a
national convention.
   Hills, speaking to American Farm Bureau Federation national
convention delegates, said the administration's goal in world trade
talks is to sharply limit the role of governments in agriculture.
   The ambassador hinted Tuesday that a 35-cent-a-gallon U.S. duty
on imported orange juice, strongly supported by Florida citrus
growers, is still among the many bargaining chips on the table.
   Gov. Bob Martinez went to Washington last week and urged Hills
to retain the tariff to help protect Florida against cheaper
Brazilian juice.
   ``Florida citrus growers are competitive,'' Hills said, when
asked what advice she would give the state's growers to compete
against Brazil if all tariffs are phased out within 10 years as the
United States has proposed.
   Greater access to world markets is what Florida citrus growers
need, through the elimination of foreign quotas and tariffs, Hills
said.
   Dan Gunter, executive director of the Florida Department of
Citrus, said after Hills' speech that he remains very concerned
about the possible phasing out of the tariff.
   ``All you would be doing is shipping our citrus industry to
Brazil. That's what would happen if you reduced those tariffs,'' he
said.
   Brazil is the world's largest citrus growing region, producing
almost 300 million 90-pound boxes of oranges a year. Florida,
second to Brazil, was expecting to harvest 130 million boxes of
oranges and 44 million boxes of grapefruit before the recent
Christmas freeze severely damaged crops. A new citrus harvest
forecast will be released Thursday.
   While Gunter said he agreed with Hills that Florida growers are
competitive in many respects, he said cheaper land, labor costs and
subsidies in Brazil leave it in a position to undercut Florida
prices.
   Bobby McKown, executive vice president of the 12,000-member
Florida Citrus Mutual in Lakeland, said he believes the juice
tariff is safe for the moment because other countries have not
indicated they are willing to drop similar trade restrictions.
   The availability of farm labor was another topic addressed
during the second day of the five-day convention, attended by 8,000
Farm Bureau members.
   Monte V. Lake, a Washington lawyer specializing in farm labor
matters, said farmers must prepare to compete for a shrinking pool
of unskilled laborers in the next decade and carefully document
shortages.
   Federal immigration reform coupled with an aging population may
result in fewer farm workers and higher labor costs, Lake said.
   A special federal program has been created to help ease such a
labor crunch but apparently will not be called upon in 1990, Lake
said, because the Labor and Agriculture departments last week
announced that no such shortage appeared to be a threat in the
coming year.
   Petitions to recruit more harvesters from countries such as
Mexico will be closely scrutinized by federal agencies as well as
unions looking to limit labor availability and keep pressure on
wages, Lake said.
   ``The government is going to be reluctant to admit more
workers,'' Lake said.

   The stock market declined slightly today,

   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.56 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said traders were disappointed by the market's
performance over the past several sessions since it began the new
year with a sharp rise to a record high in the Dow Jones industrial

   Some observers argue that hopes for an early-1990 rally had been
running so high that they left stocks vulnerable to a letdown.
   Wall Street also was bracing uneasily for corporate
fourth-quarter earnings reports due out over the next few weeks.
   Profit projections for the period have been coming down steadily

   Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors fell { to 43&rsqb;;

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade as weakness at the close
of Tuesday's trading carried over into today's action.
   The selling in soybeans was a result of news that the soybean
crop in South America is getting adequate rain.
   Soybean prices also are being pressured by slight trading of
soymeal in Europe and week demand for soyoil, said analyst William
Biedermann of Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat futures are being pressured by a lack of export demand and
expectations of more rain in winter wheat crop areas.
   Corn prices are lower due to a drop in cash prices and
disappointment over the failure of the Soviet Union to make a huge
purchase as had been rumored.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to } cent lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.06 a bushel; corn was } cent
to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.38 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
to 2 cents lower with March at $1.47{ a bushel; soybeans were a \
cent to 1\ cents lower with January at $5.70 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were pushed lower by weakening cash prices and
sluggish beef demand.
   Lower cash prices also weighed on pork futures, although pork
belly prices received support from reports warehoused pork bellies
are steadily declining.
   In early trading, live cattle were .10 cent to .30 cent lower
with February at 76.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent
to .45 cent lower with January at 84.20 cents a pound; live hogs
were .10 cent to .50 cent lower with February at 50.90 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .50 cent lower with
February at 55.10 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled most lower and pork futures were mixed
in Tuesday's trading.

<HEAD>Report: Farley May Have Trouble Financing Pepperell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago businessman William Farley may be having
trouble financing his $1.56 billion acquisition of West
Point-Pepperell Inc., according to published reports.
   West Point-Pepperell's stock closed at $37.50 a share Tuesday, a
52-week low and $20.25 below the $58-a-share price Farley agreed to
pay for the company's outstanding stock nine months ago.
   ``The stock price is eroding because there is uncertainty that
the deal can be completed,'' Richard Byrne, an analyst with Merill
Lynch Research-USA, told the Chicago Sun-Times.
   On Tuesday, The New York Times cited a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing saying that banks that made a $1.03 billion
bridge loan to West Point-Pepperell had agreed to extend the loan
through March and perhaps through June in return for additional
fees and higher interest rates.
   West Point, Ga.,-based West Point-Pepperell will now pay lead
banks Wells Fargo and Bankers Trust Co. and other lenders 2.5
percentage points over the prime instead of 1.5 percentage points.
   The banks in turn granted West Point-Pepperell permission to
advance money to West Point Acquisition Corp., a company owned by
Farley that owns 95 percent of West Point-Pepperell.
   Without such cash infusions, West Point Acquisition might run
out of cash and default on the interest payments it owes on more
than $1.4 billion in debt it took on to buy West Point-Pepperell
stock, the Times said.
   Farley Vice President Jack Albertine did not immediately return
phone calls to the Associated Press seeking comment.
   The acquisition of Pepperell by Farley last spring was said to
create the world's largest textile and apparel group, with more
than $4 billion in sales and about 70,000 employees.
   Among Farley's best known holdings are Fruit of the Loom
underwear and Acme boots. Before the takeover, Pepperell became the
nation's largest publicly owned textile company when it acquired
J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. in a joint buyout with Odyssey Partners Inc.

<TEXT>
   Garbage collectors, civil servants and
seamen have called a 24-hour strike for Thursday, kicking off a
period of labor unrest that will also affect industry and air
transportation, labor unions said Wednesday.
   The nation's 17,000 municipal workers with temporary contracts,
who include garbage collectors, are demanding permanent employment
and will extend their strike through Friday.
   Tenured employees will hold two-hour work-stoppages in
solidarity. Workers with permanent employment contracts cannot be
dismissed.
   An all-party government formed in November to tackle Greece's
$1.9 billion budget deficit has pledged to freeze public sector
hiring. It also has said that ``economy committees'' in each
ministry will try to curb state spending by up to 100 billion
drachmas, or $588 million.
   But the government has also promised to protect wages, and on
Wednesday announced a 5.8 percent wage increase for the first four
months of this year. The annual inflation rate is estimated at 16
percent.
   A 24-hour walkout also scheduled Thursday by 87,400 civil
servants seeking permanent status is expected to disrupt all
departments of the bureaucracy.
   Greek seamen based in Athens' port of Piraeus have announced
they will strike for 24 hours Thursday to demand guarantees that
their floundering pension fund will be subsidized by the state
budget.
   The country's airports and the Athens flight control region will
be closed on Jan. 18, 23 and 24 because of a strike called by air
traffic controllers, electronics engineers, and other Civil
Aviation Authority employees, their unions said. They demand that
overtime pay and benefits remain unaffected by the government's
austerity drive.
   The General Confederation of Greek Workers has called a 24-hour
strike for Jan. 25, following a three-hour work-stoppage in
December.
   The GSEE, which has 1.3 million registered members, wants wages
linked to inflation, tax reforms to lighten the burden on workers
and increased unemployment benefits.
   The government raised the prices of several goods and services
in December to offset the budget deficit. But Premier Xenophon
Zolotas recently proposed further price hikes to the conservative,
socialist, and communist parties backing his administration.
   He warned that the deficit would continue to soar unless drastic
action were taken.

   Mellon Bank Corp. plans to reorganize the
bank's top management following the resignation of Anthony P.
Terracciano earlier this week, Mellon's chairman said Wednesday.
   Frank V. Cahouet said he would not replace Terracciano, who
resigned as president to take the top spot at First Fidelity
Bancorporation in Lawrenceville, N.J.
   ``We won't replace Tony, and we won't go outside to bring people
in,'' Cahouet said.
   Terracciano's departure as president and chief operating officer
was announced Monday by the bank. His first day at First Fidelity
will be Feb. 1.
   Cahouet said he will decide in about a week on a new management
structure, then make the necessary appointments.
   He said Mellon has a group of about 30 senior managers that can
be promoted as top executives.
   ``Over the past two years we have brought in some very good
people as well as developed a lot of good people internally,''
Cahouet said. ``If this happened a year ago, it would be a problem.
Now it's less serious.''
   It is not unusual for a major bank to operate without a
president. Citicorp, the nation's largest bank, has groups of
executives that report directly to the chairman, Cahouet said.
   First Fidelity, the parent of Philadelphia's Fidelity Bank,
recruited Terracciano to become chief executive, Terracciano said.
``I wasn't looking,'' he said.
   Of his 2{ years at Mellon, Terracciano said, ``It's been the
most exciting, the most satisfying part of my banking career,''
which included 23 years at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, where
he was vice chairman.
   Terracciano said he knew nothing of a $2 billion merger offer
from PNC Financial Corp. rejected by First Fidelity last week. The
Wall Street Journal reported the bid Tuesday, prompting speculation
First Fidelity was vulnerable to a merger.
   ``I think the fact that they asked me to accept this assignment
is an indication of their intention'' to remain independent. ``I
wouldn't have gone into a six-month job,'' he said.

   Shares finished sharply lower on London's Stock
Exchange Wednesday.
   London took its cue from recent weak performances in New York
and Tokyo, and then proceeded to drift lower as investor interest
dwindled.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 23.7
points, or 1 percent, at 2,412.6 points. Volume was 449.3 million
shares, compared with 563.7 million Tuesday.
   Traders reported fairly good two-way trading, but said the
market was becoming increasingly sensitive to warnings on the
outlook for British corporate profits.

   Stock prices tumbled again today as the selling
that set in on Tuesday continued.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 28.37 on Tuesday,
dropped 27.73 to 2,738.27 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 410 up, 1,087 down
and 427 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were disappointed by the market's
uninspired performance over the past several sessions since it
began the new year with a sharp rise to a record high in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   Some observers argue that hopes for an early-1990 rally had been
running so high that they left stocks vulnerable to a letdown.
   Wall Street also was bracing uneasily for corporate
fourth-quarter earnings reports due out over the next few weeks.
   Profit projections for the period have been coming down steadily

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar ended lower against major
currencies in Europe on Wednesday as the U.S. currency fluctuated
in rumor-driven, choppy trading.
   Gold prices rose more than $5 an ounce, pushed up by technical
factors and uneasiness about political developments in the Soviet
Union.
   Dealers said the dollar initially slipped on continuing strength
in the West German mark. Then rumors hitting the market during the
European afternoon drove the dollar to a high of 1.6845 marks
before profit-taking emerged.
   Dealers said unconfirmed rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve
and possibly the Deutsche Bundesbank sold marks for yen caused many
market players to cover short dollar positions, or buy dollars to
fulfill previous agreements to sell them.
   ``There were vicious price movements today,'' one London dealer
said.
   The market was susceptible to these rumors because there was no
fresh news Wednesday. The next set of U.S. economic data is due
Friday, when producer price and retail sales figures are to be
released.
   Dealers said the market lacks clear direction at the moment.
   ``People need to reassess what's going on,'' said a corporate
dealer at a U.S. bank. ``It may be a while before things are more
straightforward.''
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6625 from $1.6540 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday:
1.6795 West German marks, down from 1.6823; 1.5120 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5260; 5.7145 French francs, down from 5.7305; 1.8815
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8970; 1,255.00 Italian lire, down from
1,257.75; and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1610.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.33 Japanese yen to a closing 145.30
yen. But later, in London, it was quoted at 145.15 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $408.55 a troy ounce
from $403.50 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of
$409.25 an ounce from $403.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.82 to close at a bid $404.08
an ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.30 a troy
ounce from $5.24 late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. filed suit
today against MCI Communications Corp. and its telemarketing agent,
claiming they stole some of AT&amp;T's long-distance customers through
deceptive practices or by switching services without their consent.
   AT&amp;T also said it had asked the Federal Communications
Commission to amend its rules so that telephone customers would
have to provide written permission before switching long-distance
carriers.
   Under current rules, customers can authorize a change verbally.
   ``We believe our proposal to the FCC will curtail the numerous
instances of unauthorized switching _ or `slamming' as it's known
in the industry _ that consumers have endured,'' Merrill Tutton, an
AT&amp;T vice president, told a news conference in New York.
   Washington-based MCI denied any wrongdoing, saying AT&amp;T was
merely frustrated by MCI's success in winning over new customers.
   ``This (allegation) is just another example of AT&amp;T preaching
competition on one hand and whining when competition takes hold in
the marketplace,'' the company said in a statement. ``MCI has been
winning customers in the marketplace at a rate of over 100,000 a
week based on value and superlative customer service.
   ``We view AT&amp;T's action indicative of their frustration and
simply another misdirected attempt to impede the competitive
marketplace.''
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., AT&amp;T
alleges MCI and MCI's telemarketing representative, Pioneer
Teletechnologies of Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, used misleading or false
information to persuade AT&amp;T customers to switch their
long-distance service. It also claims MCI switched AT&amp;T customers
without their knowledge and consent.
   For example, AT&amp;T claims customers had told it that MCI had told
them it was merging with AT&amp;T or that AT&amp;T was going out of
business.
   The suit asks for an unspecified amount of damages.
   Tutton said the company could not provide a specific amount of
losses it suffered through the allged scheme. But he said
preliminary studies showed that from February to November of last
year between 10 percent and 15 percent of the AT&amp;T customers
switching to other long-distance carriers had been unaware of the
change.
   AT&amp;T claimed it that the ``many thousands of complaints'' from
consumers had prompted it to seek legal against agains MCI.

<HEAD>Farmer Selling, Lagging Exports Push Futures Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in the wake increased
marketing of crops by farmers.
   A lack of export business dragged down wheat prices, as traders
showed disappointment over the Soviet Union's failure to make
additional purchases. The Soviets bought 480,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat on Tuesday.
   Forecasts of rain for the Central Plains, which would aid the
growth of the winter wheat crop, also hampered futures prices.
   Corn prices were pressured by increased marketing by farmers,
said analyst Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Karlin said farmers were holding on to their corn, hoping for a
market rally. But they are trying to take advantage of current
prices, fearing they could go lower, he said.
   Soybeans were pushed down by reports of rain in South America,
which should help the growth of soybean crops, increased selling
and the failure of new business to materialize in the soy oil
market.
   Oats prices plunged as commission house sell stops were reached
amid reports Canadian farmers are increasing their oat exports to
the United States, Karlin said.
   At the close, wheat was a { cent to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.05{ a bushel; corn was } cent
to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.38 a bushel; oats were 3} cents
to 4{ cents lower with March at $1.45 cents a bushel; soybeans were

<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. on Wednesday
announced cut-rate calling plans to Western Europe, the Pacific and
Canada.
   The plans _ Call Europe, Call Pacific and Call Canada _ will
provide flat, per-minute rates during weekdays and all weekend for
a $3 monthly fee, MCI said.
   Callers will be charged 59 cents per minute to call any of 23
Western European nations on weekdays from 3 p.m. to 8 a.m., and all
weekend.
   In the Call Pacific plan, calls may be made to Australia, New
Zealand and eight Asian nations for 79 cents per minute from 10
p.m. to 2 p.m. the following day, and all weekend.
   Call Canada is priced at 19 cents per minute from 5 p.m. to 8
a.m. weekdays and all weekend.
   The plans are expected to be available Jan. 15, said Wayne
Gattinella, MCI vice president for consumer marketing.
   Gattinella said a 10-minute call at 8 p.m. to the United Kingdom
would cost $5.90 under the new plan, compared with current MCI
prices ranging from $8 to $8.50 for the same 10-minute call.
   An evening 10-minute call to France now costs between $7.75 and
$8.25, Gattinella said. On Saturday morning, it now costs about
$8.50.
   MCI estimated that residential international calling represents
a $5 billion market and is growing 25 percent annually. It
estimated that 10 percent of U.S. consumers make monthly overseas
calls, with an average duration of 10 minutes.
   The company said it plans to add additional countries in 1990.

<HEAD>Court Limits Ability of Multinationals to Challenge State Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday limited the
ability of multinational corporations to challenge state taxes in
federal court in a case involving two foreign-based companies that
challenged California law.
   The justices ruled that a law generally barring federal courts
from handling lawsuits that attack a state tax applies to
foreign-based multinational businesses.
   A federal appeals court had ruled that the law did not apply,
drawing a distinction between multinational businesses based in
this country and those based in foreign countries.
   The Supreme Court's unanimous decision means that two
foreign-based corporations will have to turn to California courts
to challenge that state's business tax.
   The justices in 1984 gave states a major victory when ruling
that California could tax multinational corporations doing business
in the state based on the businesses' worldwide dealings.
   The California tax employs what is known as the unitary system,
and bases individual tax bills on a share of the worldwide
earnings, payroll and property value of a multinational corporation
and its subsidiaries.
   The 1984 ruling dealt only with multinationals with parent
companies based in the United States. The California tax
subsequently was challenged by Alcan Aluminium Limited, a Canadian
corporation, and Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, a Brittish
corporation. Both have U.S. subsidiaries doing business in
California.
   The suits were filed in federal court in Chicago, where the
California Franchise Tax Board maintains an office.
   A federal judge threw out the suits, ruling that they must be
filed in California court. But the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated the suits.
   The Supreme Court said the trial judge was right.
   Writing for the court, Justice Byron R. White said, ``To the
extent they are available, California's refund procedures
constitute a plain, speedy and efficient remedy.''
   White noted that only the two corporations' American
subsidiaries, and not the foreign-based parent firms, have the
legal standing to sue in California courts.
   But that makes no difference, he said, and the federal Tax
Injunction Act still applies. The law bars federal courts from
handling such suits if state courts offer a ``plain, speedy and
efficient remedy.''
   ``As sole shareholders, (the foreign corporations) have total
control over (the subsidiaries). They can direct in all respects
their subsidiaries' pursuit of state court relief from the unitary
tax,'' White said.
   He said the parent firms' inability to sue in their own names
``is not determinative.''
   ``To rule otherwise would be to elevate form over substance,''
White said.
   The case is Franchise Tax Board vs. Alcan Aluminium, 88-1400.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle told Japan's top
trade official Wednesday that easing repression in China depends on
close coordination among the United States, Japan and other
countries, officials said.
   Quayle and Hikaru Matsunaga, Japanese minister of international
trade and industry, welcomed China's announcement that it is easing
martial law.
   But Quayle cautioned against go-it-alone policies, declaring
that the situation has not yet returned to normalcy after last
summer's bloody Beijing crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations,
said Japanese Embassy spokesman Noriyuki Shikata.
   Further improvement depends on action by the Chinese side, and
what is important is that other countries coordinate, Quayle was
quoted as saying. Matsunaga said Japan wants to cooperate with the
United States on China while opposing isolation of Beijing, Shikata
said.
   A U.S. official requesting anonymity said Quayle told Matsunaga
that American policy toward China was bringing some improvement and
Japan, while eager to normalize relations, should closely
coordinate with Washington.
   During the 30-minute meeting Matsunaga also reaffirmed Japan's
intention to become an ``import superpower'' and described to the
vice president its program to stimulate imports of foreign products
with tax breaks, tariff reductions and overseas missions, officials
said.
   Matsunaga predicted victory for Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's
Liberal Democratic Party in next month's parliamentary election,
after which, he said, the U.S.-Japan talks will resume on causes of
trade imbalance that stem from the two countries' different
commercial traditions and lifestyles.
   Stressing partnership with the United States rather than
economic rivalry, Matsunaga arrived Tuesday night for two days of
meetings. He also was scheduled to see Michael Boskin, chairman of
President Bush's council of economic advisers, Secretary of State
James Baker III, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Environmental Protection Administrator William Reilly.
   The United States, revitalizing its competitiveness, will remain
the world's leading economic power and enjoy strong Japanese
political support during the 1990s, Matsunaga said in a speech
Tuesday.
   ``The United States, backed by its great technological prowess
and its massive supplies of capital and resources, will continue to
have the most important economy for supporting the international
economic system in the 1990s,'' he told an audience of
industrialists and civic leaders in Dallas before flying to
Washington.
   Such statements addressed anxieties reflected in occasional U.S.
opinion polls showing Japan with its powerful economy overshadowing
the Soviet Union as a threat to the United States' future. The
polls reportedly have caused concern among leaders of Kaifu's
government.
   The minister took pains to defend Japan against U.S. accusations
that it is a closed society and a closed market.
   He noted that Japan in 1988 boosted imports of manufactured
goods 39 percent worldwide and 34 percent from the United States.
   Matsunaga also stressed opportunities for U.S._Japanese
cooperation both in the Asia-Pacific region and in helping the
newly democratic countries of East Europe move toward market
economies.

<HEAD>Company To Launch 3-D Sound System in Super Bowl Ad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new technique unveiled Wednesday that produces
``three-dimensional'' sound seeming to come from many points in a
room will debut on nationwide television in an advertisement during
the Super Bowl.
   The creators of QSound believe the technique, which gives the
impression of individual noises or musical notes emanating from
more than just a pair of speakers, could change the sound of music,
television and video games.
   It is designed to be heard through a conventional stereo or
stereo television and will be introduced to the public in a
Coca-Cola ad during the Super Bowl broadcast on Sunday, Jan. 28.
The ad was shown at a news conference Wednesday by Archer
Communications Inc.
   ``QSound is an innovation that could, within the next few years,
fundamentally change the way people hear music, play videos,
experience movies and watch TV,'' said Lawrence G. Ryckman,
president of Archer Communications.
   What's unique about QSound, Archer Communications officials
said, is that it doesn't require any special equipment to get the
three-dimensional effect. The work is done in the recording studio.
   Specially developed multiple-track taping machines and computer
software allows sound engineers to isolate individual instruments,
singers or sounds and make them seem to emanate from specific
locations in a room.
   The technology will enable artists to make recordings that let
the listener feel that he or she is sitting in front of a live band
instead of a stereo.
   ``The technique fools the ear,'' says Dan Lowe, the audio
engineer who helped invent QSound.
   The Coke ad is an updated version of the 1971 ``Hilltop''
commercial, which featured scores of young people singing ``I'd
Like To Teach the World To Sing'' on a hill in Italy.
   At the opening of the new 60-second ad, a viewer can hear a bird
chirping off to the side and the sound of a breeze from behind. The
main music tracks and featured singers come from the television
speakers while the voices of the chorus seem to come from
throughout the room.
   CBS will broadcast the Super Bowl ad in stereo, and nearly half
the network's affiliates are capable of transmitting a stereo
broadcast, according to Michael A. Biendorff, vice president of
Marketing Planning for Coca-Cola USA. The company estimates up to
20 percent of U.S. television households have stereo TVs.
   Lowe said Archer Communications signed an agreement last month
with Nintendo to incorporate QSound in the company's video games.
New games and equipment should be available later this year, he
said.
   Archer Communications, with offices in Los Angeles and Calgary,
Alberta, also hopes to sign deals to record music casettes, compact
discs, and movie videocasettes in QSound, Lowe said.
   The company's chairman is George Folsey Jr., a producer of
movies such as ``Coming to America'' and ``Trading Places,'' who is
working to market the system in Hollywood.

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo expressed regret Wednesday about the Eastern Airlines
strike, but he insisted he was optimistic about the rebuilding
carrier.
   ``While the airline that's out there today is not as big as the
airline it was before, I believe very strongly and I believe you
will, too, when you see it that a lot of quality has been
substituted for quantity,'' Lorenzo told an overflow Downtown
Rotary Club luncheon crowd of 250 people.
   ``We face the '90s with great optimism,'' he said.
   Lorenzo walked through a gauntlet of chanting, protesting
Machinists, whose strike is in its 11th month. Police officers
stood guard for the speech, the first in South Florida in months by
Lorenzo and one of a handful of public appearances he's made in the
area since Texas Air bought Eastern nearly four years ago.
   ``The last year has been a very difficult one,'' Lorenzo told
his audience. ``There have been mistakes, and there have been a lot
of things I know all parties would like to change.''
   He added: ``If you look at the last nine months as a battle, it
is a battle no one has won, with the possible tiny exception of
consumers.''
   He said Eastern had lost $1 billion in the eight years before he
took over, and major changes were needed. He said union leaders
were reluctant to face the needed changes, but he understood the
difficulty of their position.
   Lorenzo said thousands of dedicated Eastern employees are out of
their jobs because ``they got caught in a system that was no fault
of their own.'' He said cutting wages and employees was hard ``from
a human point of view,'' but there was no choice.
   Despite his reputation as a union buster, he said he doubted any
other management could have done much differently.
   Lorenzo said Miami-based Eastern has had a strong response to
new discount fares, starting at $69 one way, and was getting good
consumer response to its service overall.
   He said by mid-year, the percentage of Eastern's operating costs
that are related to labor will be down to 25 percent, compared with
the upper 30s before the strike that began last March 4.
   In brief exchanges with reporters as he left, Lorenzo said
Eastern is ``very committed to South Florida,'' despite sharp
reductions in its Miami flight operations ahead of the planned sale
of its Latin American routes to American Airlines. He said there
were no plans to liquidate Eastern.
   Frank Ortis, the Machinists union Local 702 president, wasn't
allowed to attend the speech. He said afterward that Lorenzo ``is
in big trouble'' as he tries to bring Eastern out of Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization.
   Eastern filed for protection from creditors five days after the
strike began and proceeded to rebuild by hiring non-union
replacement workers.
   Eastern is plagued by cancellations and ``their load factors
have been disastrous,'' Ortis said. ``It's time for Frank Lorenzo
to come to his senses and sell the airline so we can save it.''
   Although union pilots and flight attendants ended their sympathy
walkouts in late November, Ortis said 96 percent of the Machinists
remain on strike.
   More than 100 protesters greeted Lorenzo with chants of ``Choke,
Frank, choke!'' and warned Rotarians to ``secure your wallets.''
They wanted to let Lorenzo know ``we're not going to go away,''
Ortis said.

<HEAD>Two Faces of Boeing: Cold War Blues, Big Thaw Business</HEAD>

   While Boeing Co.'s defense people are competing
for weapons contracts, colleagues in another part of the aerospace
giant a few miles away are talking about peddling jumbo jetliners
to the Soviets.
   It's an apparent contradiction that reflects problems facing
many defense contractors, struggling to adapt to the Soviet bloc's
transformation that has lessened the threat of war.
   But the disparity seems especially acute at Boeing, a leading
civilian manufacturer as well as a Pentagon supplier of weapons
gear ranging from Stealth bomber parts to Lance missiles.
   ``The other day we were talking about a new system that's a
follow-on to Lance,'' said B. Dan Pinick, president of the new
Boeing Defense &amp; Space Group. ``I said, `Well, gee, who are we
going to shoot 'em at? You know, those are our customers now.'''
   The Big Thaw, as the East-West relaxation sometimes is called,
has come at an awkward time for Boeing, which has been losing money
on the military side anyway and wanted to improve its chance to
land more defense work.
   That prospect may be more remote because Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney has ordered the armed services to plan on cutting $180
billion in spending from fiscal 1992 to 1994.
   Boeing already has felt the spending pinch with the halt of
production spending on the V-22 vertical takeoff plane it's
building with Bell Helicopter Textron, and likely delays in
production of the radar-fooling Stealth bomber, for which Boeing is
a major subcontractor.
   On Jan. 1 Boeing formally consolidated its military and
aerospace divisions into Boeing Defense &amp; Aerospace Group, as part
of an effort to make the business profitable.
   Boeing Aerospace &amp; Electronics _ already combined in 1989 _ was
melded with Boeing Advanced Systems, Boeing Helicopters, military
programs of Boeing Military Airplanes and ARGOSystems, its military
electronics company.
   On the civilian side, meanwhile, orders for jetliners are at an
all-time high, and foreign customers include a number of communist
countries once considered potential U.S. enemies.
   Moreover, over the past few months Boeing aides have been
talking about possible sales to the Soviets, who have expressed
interest in 747s and other big planes, far more advanced and
quieter than their own Ilyushin models. A couple of Kremlin
aviation emissaries recently visited Boeing's Seattle complex to
talk about a potential order.
   Nonetheless, Pinick said he isn't ready to concede an end to the
Cold War, which once helped carry Boeing through hard times. In the
1970s, when jetliner sales foundered, defense work softened the
impact.
   Now, while its commercial business powers Boeing to record
profits, the company has said the military and aerospace segments
will show a loss when the books are closed on 1989.
   In 1988, those segments made just $29 million before taxes on
revenues of $5.125 billion. In 1986, they had operating profits of
$422 million on revenues of $6 billion.
   ``We're in a valley now, but over time I think we'll demonstrate
our historic ability to provide an attractive return,'' Pinick
said. ``Or we get out of the business. I mean, it's simple. We
aren't going to do this for any other reason.''
   Boeing's military profits were hurt in the late 1980s by a
number of lucrative contracts ending at the same time the company
was competing for new work, said aerospace analyst Paul Nisbet of
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. It also was a time when
the Pentagon was demanding contractors assume more financial risk
for new projects.
   Contracts for AWACS radar planes, B-1 bomber avionics, and
air-launched cruise missiles all ran their course, while Boeing
declared such programs as the space station living quarters, the
small ICBM launcher, a new short-range attack missile and the V-22
``must wins,'' Nisbet said.
   ``They won every one they named and spent whatever they had to
get them,'' he said.
   ``We may have overshot the mark a little bit in
aggressiveness,'' Pinick said, but added, ``If you were going to
play in that league, you had to take a lot of risk.''
   Pinick has set a goal of cutting overhead by $100 million in the
next two years. Middle management jobs likely will be sacrificed,
though Pinick declined to estimate how many.
   ``I have said to people on the programs, `What I want is for you
folks down there doing the job to be unperturbed by this. Everybody
between you and me is at risk,''' he said.
   About 800 jobs were lost in 1989 after Boeing Aerospace and
Electronics combined, though most people found jobs elsewhere in
the company, which employs more than 140,000 worldwide.
   Boeing's defense work problems are one of a number of
embarrassments and setbacks for the company this past year, ranging
from involvement in a Pentagon procurement scandal to a prolonged
strike that delayed airplane production.
   It pleaded guilty in November to two felony counts stemming from
the scandal and paid $5.2 million in penalties. It also agreed to
pay the Air Force $11 million to settle claims of excessive
billing, and is under investigation for other possible
defense-related overcharges.

   The dollar ended mostly higher Wednesday against
major foreign currencies in volatile trading following reports of
central-bank intervention.
   Gold prices rose sharply on technical factors and market concern
about continued political unrest in the Soviet Union.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $412.40 a troy ounce, up $8.20 from Tuesday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold of
$411.25 an ounce, up $5.65.
   Currency dealers said the dollar initially fell due to the
continued strength in the West German mark. But they said reports
that the Federal Reserve bought dollars for marks and that West
Germany's central bank sold marks for yen gave a lift to the dollar.
   ``That was the story of the day,'' said Linda McLaughlin, a
trader with Chemical New York Capital Markets Group.
   Dealers said the market was awaiting new data that will shed
more light on the U.S. economy. The government is set to release
reports Friday on December producer prices and retail sales.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.33 Japanese yen to 145.30 yen. It traded
at 145.15 yen in London, and at 145.55 yen in New York, up from
144.92 yen.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling was
worth $1.6625 in London, up from $1.6540 late Tuesday, and $1.6625
in New York, up from $1.6585.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, vs. Tuesday's quotes,
included: 1.6825 West German marks, up from 1.6730; 1.5165 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5145; 5.7265 French francs, up from 5.7025;
1,257.25 Italian lire, up from 1,251.25; and 1.15855 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.16055.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.6795 West
German marks, down from 1.6823; 1.5120 Swiss francs, down from
1.5260; 5.7145 French francs, down from 5.7305; 1.8815 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8970; 1,255.00 Italian lire, down from
1,257.75; and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1610.
   Gold also rose in London to a late bid of $408.55 an ounce from
$403.50 Tuesday. In Zurich, gold jumped to $409.25 an ounce from
$403.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed up $1.82 at $404.08 an ounce.
   Silver prices also strengthened. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.306 a troy ounce, up 7.2
cents from Tuesday. Silver rose in London to $5.30 an ounce from
$5.24.

   Stock prices recorded their second straight loss
Wednesday as hopes for an early-1990 rally dimmed on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 15.36 to 2,750.64,
bringing its drop over the past two sessions to 43.73 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
516 up, 1,053 down and 417 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were disappointed with the market's
uninspired performance over the past several sessions since it
began the new year with a sharp rise to a record high in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   Some observers argue that hopes for an early-1990 rally had been
running so high that they left stocks vulnerable to a letdown.
   Wall Street also was bracing uneasily for corporate
fourth-quarter earnings reports due out over the next few weeks.
   Profit projections for the period have been coming down steadily
as evidence accumulated that the pace of business activity was
sluggish at best.
   Germany Fund bucked the downtrend in dramatic style, surging 3\
to 24&lsqb;. Traders continued to bid enthusiastically for that and
other ``country'' closed-end funds seeking a way to benefit from
new worldwide trade opportunities in the '90s.
   Elsewhere in the group, Helvetia Fund rose 1\ to 17&lsqb;; Thai Fund
1&lsqb; to 35&rsqb;; Malaysia Fund 1~ to 24&rsqb;; Italy Fund 1 to 18; Brazil Fund
1\ to 15, and Austria Fund { to 22}.
   Gold stocks also predominated on the list of new 52-week highs.
ASA Ltd. gained 2&rsqb; to 59|; Amax Gold 1&lsqb; to 19|; Placer Dome 1 to
20; Newmont Gold 1} to 53, and Homestake Mining ~ to 20}.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors fell &rsqb; to 43{;
International Business Machines &rsqb; to 99; Philip Morris { to 39};
Merck 1 to 76&rsqb;, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph \ to 45.
   Delta Air Lines dropped 1| to 66}. The company said its results
for the fourth quarter didn't measure up to its earlier
expectations.
   MGM-UA Communications, which indicated that it had ended active
efforts to find an acquirer, lost 1 to 14\.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 175.99 million
shares, against 155.21 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 208.39 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $25.48 billion, or 0.75
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of nearly 1,700 listed common stocks
slumped 1.23 to 192.12.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.39 to 399.15, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.31 at 347.31.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 6.07 to 450.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 378.29, down 2.15.

   Exxon Corp. said Wednesday it has created a
senior management position to deal with the giant oil company's
environmental and safety plans, an outgrowth of the Alaska oil
spill.
   Edwin J. Hess, an executive formerly in charge of marketing,
refining and planning for international operations at the nation's
largest oil company, has been named to the new position of vice
president, environment and safety.
   Hess will report to President Lee R. Raymond. The appointment,
effective Jan. 15, makes Hess one of 10 vice presidents at the
company.
   ``We've always had an environmental staff but never at the vice
presidential level,'' Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said. ``By
putting it on that level it facilitates environmental information
worldwide coming to the most senior level of the corporation.''
   Exxon management has been criticized for the handling of the
Alaska oil spill last March 24 and subsequent cleanup. A grounded
Exxon tanker fouled Prince William Sound, the worst spill in U.S.
history.
   The company was thrust into the public eye again last week when
an Exxon-owned pipeline leaked 567,000 gallons of home heating oil
into a shipping channel between the New York and New Jersey.
   Since the Alaska spill, Exxon shareholders have called on the
company to show greater accountability. The company subsequently
named an environmentalist to the board of directors and created a
special committee to review environmental issues.
   Hess will be responsible for developing, reviewing and
coordinating Exxon's environmental and safety plans, Johnson said.
   He will work with the oil company's regional offices, who will
maintain primary responsibility for environment and safety issues,
she said.

<HEAD>Conrail's Latest Leader Copes with Sliding Traffic, Looks to
Future</HEAD>

   No sooner had Conrail made James A. Hagen
its fourth chairman in five months when a new problem emerged for
the freight-hauling giant, a former government-run hodgepodge of
bankrupt railroads.
   ``We could see early on in the summer that the economy was
starting to slip a little _ the autos, the steel, the housing,''
Hagen said. ``The pieces of business that really make a difference
to Conrail were really starting to slide.''
   It was baptism by fire for Hagen, who was immediately forced to
trim one of the nation's biggest freight companies.
   This was especially difficult because Conrail already had been
pared and restructured from its financially ailing roots, the
jumble of a half dozen Northeast railroads taken over by the
government in 1976 and resold to the public more than a decade
later.
   Hagen cut costs, combined trains, curbed maintenance and
eliminated hundreds of jobs. The effort seemed to work: Conrail's
third-quarter profit rose 4.8 percent despite a 5.9 percent drop in
freight.
   ``Whether we can continue to do that or not, we'll just have to
see,'' Hagen said.
   A lot of Conrail's future requires a wait-and-see attitude. This
spring Conrail loses its government protection against takeovers.
Moreover, the uncertain economy can play havoc with demand for
freight, Conrail's lifeline. ``It provides a challenge to make it
come out right when the traffic starts sliding like it is now,''
Hagen said in a recent interview at Conrail's Philadelphia office.
``But, on the other hand, that's the job. You're supposed to figure
it out and how to make the equation come out as best you can.''
   Hagen has said Conrail, the nation's fifth-largest railroad in
freight revenue, expects to show another traffic decline when
fourth-quarter figures are calculated. Higher-revenue freight
including autos, auto parts and chemicals is down, while
lower-revenue freight such as coal is up.
   That means the trimming Hagen began to keep Conrail profitable
isn't over. Conrail recently said it would cut 450 non-union jobs,
reduce the fleet of 68,500 freight cars and 1,946 locomotives and
make them haul more frequently.
   Hagen, 57, became chairman, president and chief executive
officer May 18, three months after the sudden death of Richard D.
Sanborn.
   Sanborn had held the same titles just six weeks. His death was
an unexpected jolt in an otherwise smooth transition from L.
Stanley Crane, the former Southern Railway executive who guided
Conrail into the private sector after 11 years of direct government
involvement.
   Stanley E.G. Hillman was acting chairman during the search for
Sanborn's replacement.
   Hagen, a 31-year railroad veteran known for innovations in
marketing, was plucked from CSX Transportation Inc., the railroad
subsidiary of Richmond, Va.-based CSX Corp.
   He had been Conrail's senior vice president for marketing and
sales from 1977 to 1985 and earlier played a role in Conrail's
formation at the U.S. Railway Association, the agency created to
cope with the threat of losing rail service in the Northeast.
   The background helped as Hagen took the $450,000-a-year job at
Conrail, which operates in 14 Northeastern and Midwestern states
and Quebec.
   ``I knew a lot of the people, I knew the environment, I knew the
system, knew the railroad,'' Hagen said. ``But one of the things
that's changed is that we're out in the marketplace and we're a
publicly held company.''
   In that marketplace, Conrail's stock price ended 1989 at
$47.875, up 41.9 percent from $33.75 at the first of the year. Part
of the reason was speculation that an eventual takeover offer would
emerge.
   One reason Conrail might be attractive is the railroad's small
long-term debt, a lower price than its $60 book value and cash
reserves of about $600 million. That means the stock is potentially
worth more if the company is sold and broken up again.
   But the rumors about a takeover have been offset by an
expectation that Conrail will move to protect itself before
government restrictions end April 2 on how much of Conrail any
single investor can own.
   President Bush recently signed legislation that would enable the
company to buy back significant amounts of its own stock, one
possible anti-takeover defense.
   ``I think they (Conrail executives) have the ability and the
means and probably the desire to move the stock up so they don't
show up on any (computer) screen of undervalued companies,'' said
Anthony Hatch, a railroad analyst in New York for PaineWebber Inc.
   The railroad is reviewing its corporate financial structure and
expects to report the results early this year. Hagen said the
review would focus on how the company can best allocate money for
the future.
   He said he expects Conrail to remain independent and continue
relationships with railroads west of the Mississippi River, rather
than merging with another major carrier to form a transcontinental
railroad.
   The review is separate from what Hagen described as ``a
day-by-day evaluation'' of whether it should cut its labor force
below the 1988 average of 32,595 employees, down from 82,877 in
1978. For the third quarter, the average number of employees was
32,285, down from 34,088 a year earlier.
   Hatch said it is too early to size Hagen up, because he's been
in the job a short time and followed strong leaders in Crane and
Sanborn. Nonetheless, Hatch said, ``I think he looks like the man
for the job. I think Conrail is a company that is very well run and
it's doing some very smart things now.''

<HEAD>Shamrock Broadcasting to Sell Two TV, Three Radio Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Broadcasting Inc. said Wednesday
it would sell two TV stations and three radio stations to cut debt
that it incurred during an aggressive five-year expansion.
   Shamrock, which is privately owned by the Roy E. Disney family,
said it would sell KMGC-FM in Dallas to Cook Inlet Radio Partners
L.P. for $22 million.
   The other stations to be sold are KUDL-FM and WHB-AM in Kansas
City, Mo., KXXV-TV in Waco, Texas, and KTAB-TV in Abilene, Texas.
Shamrock did not identify the investors seeking to buy those four
stations, which are expected to fetch about $30 million.
   ``We're talking with some folks about the Texas properties,''
Shamrock President Bill Clark said in a telephone interview.
``We're just putting Kansas City on the market.''
   In a statement, Clark said ``the increasing maturity of our
stations operating in a more intense competitive environment
together with some uncertainty on the economic front influenced our
decision.''
   During a five-year period that ended in October, Shamrock bought
a number of failed or startup stations for ``stick value'' _ the
rock-bottom price for an antenna and license. It grew from five
stations in four markets to 15 stations in 10 markets during that
time.
   ``So we had some pretty severe cash flow drains during the
startup process,'' Clark said. ``We're not a negative cash flow
company by any means ... (but) now we want to maximize cash flow
from our remaining stations.''
   The sale of the stations will leave Shamrock with just one
television station, WTVQ in Lexington, Ky.
   Clark described Shamrock's recent business as excellent, with
growth in advertising revenue of 24 percent last year compared with
7 percent for the broadcast industry as a whole.
   With the sales, Shamrock will be focusing on larger markets
where it already has radio stations, such as San Francisco,
Seattle, Detroit, Houston, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Denver and Phoenix.
   KMGC was part of Starr Broadcasting, which was purchased for $36
million by Roy Disney, Walt Disney's nephew and vice chairman of
the Walt Disney Co., when he started Shamrock 10 years ago.
   Shamrock also will defer taxes on the sale of KMGC under a
federal law encouraging sales of stations to minority-owned
companies. The Cook Inlet partnership involves Aleuts, Eskimos and
American Indians.

<HEAD>Stock Market Weakness Spurs Rise in Precious Metals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices surged Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange on the heels of an energy rally, the sliding
stock market and concern over the political climate in the Soviet
Union.
   On other markets, energy futures were sharply higher, grain and
soybeans were lower, livestock and pork were mixed, and copper
declined.
   Gold settled $8 to $8.40 higher with the contract for delivery
in February at $414.20 a troy ounce. Silver was 7 cents to 7.2
cents higher with March at $5.368 a troy ounce.
   The surge in gold prices began overnight with rumors that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev had resigned, said analyst Bette
Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The rumors proved
false, but they stepped up demand for gold among Japanese and
European buyers.
   The sharp drop of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in recent days also
spurred gold buying, as did a 15-point drop Wednesday in the Dow
Jones industrial average.
   A violent railroad strike in South Africa, a leading gold
producer, also caused concern in the gold market.
   A secondary factor was a surge in energy prices on New York's
Mercantile Exchange. Analysts say some investors view increased
crude prices as an inflation barometer and the gold market as an
inflation hedge.
   The rise came amid continued concern over supplies following
American Petroleum Institute inventory data, said Jerry Samuels, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The API figures, released Tuesday, showed a drawdown of 6.4
million barrels in gasoline stocks last week, more than was
expected. There also was a decrease in stocks of distillates, which
include heating oil, but a slight increase in crude oil stocks.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 45 cents to 83 cents
higher with February at $22.90 a barrel; heating oil was 1.40 cents
to 2 cents higher with February at 66.88 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.20 cents to 3.45 cents higher with February at 64.33
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   A lack of export business dragged down wheat prices, as traders
showed disappointment over the Soviet Union's failure to make
additional purchases after 480,000 metric ton buy of U.S. wheat
Tuesday.
   Forecasts of rain for the Central Plains, which would aid the
growth of the winter wheat crop, also hampered futures prices. Corn
prices were pressured by increased marketing by farmers, said
analyst Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybeans were pushed down by reports of rain in South America,
which should help the growth of soybean crops, by increased selling
and by the failure of new business to materialize in the soy oil
market.
   Wheat was a { cent to 1} cents lower with March at $4.05{ a
bushel; corn was } cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.38 a
bushel; oats were 3} cents to 4{ cents lower with March at $1.45
cents a bushel; soybeans were 2} cents to 4} cents lower with
January at $5.67\ a bushel.
   Copper prices slipped lower on the Comex, with the sliding stock
market being cited by analysts for the metal's poor performance.
   Copper was 1.15 cents to 2.10 cents lower with January at $1.087
a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .08 cent lower to .65 cent higher with February
at 77.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .38 cent
lower with January at 84.27 cents a pound; hogs were .28 cent lower
to .40 cent higher with February at 51.02 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .27 cent to 1.05 cents higher with February at
55.87 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Prices Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices surged Wednesday in
reaction to news of a big decline in gasoline inventories.
   Unleaded gasoline posted the biggest gains on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for February delivery rising
3.45 cents to 64.33 cents a gallon. Crude and heating oil futures
also made strong gains.
   Prices opened higher and advanced steadily through the day in
response to weekly inventory figures released by the American
Petroleum Institute late Tuesday. The figures showed gasoline
stocks fell by nearly 6.5 million gallons in the week ended Jan. 5,
a much bigger drop than expected.
   ``The APIs brought the market back,'' said Mary L. Haskins,
assistant vice president for institutional energy futures at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``The sharp decline has revived some fears of a shortage heading
into the driving season,'' a dealer at another brokerage said of
the drop in gasoline inventories.
   Futures prices also were boosted by the API's report that
inventories of crude oil rose only slightly in the latest week, he
said.
   Gasoline contracts for March, April and May delivery rose
between 1.90 cents and 2.92 cents a gallon.
   The gains extended a rally that began Tuesday after three days
of sharp declines. Unleaded gasoline for February delivery rose
2.40 cents Tuesday after falling 8.75 cents over the previous three
sessions.
   No. 2 heating oil for February delivery rose 1.83 cents to 66.88
cents a gallon on the New York Merc. Contracts for March, April and
May delivery rose by 1.60 cents to 2.00 cents a gallon.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 83 cents to $22.90 per 42-gallon
barrel. Other delivery months also advanced but remained below $22
a barrel.

<HEAD>MCI Announces Cheaper Rates to Europe, Pacific, Canada</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with AT&amp;T international calling

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. on Wednesday
announced cut-rate calling plans to Western Europe, the Pacific and
Canada.
   The plans _ Call Europe, Call Pacific and Call Canada _ will
provide flat, per-minute rates during weekdays and all weekend for
a $3 monthly fee, MCI said.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. responded to MCI's plan with
a belated announcement of its own international calling program,
AT&amp;T Reach Out World. AT&amp;T said it the plan has been in effect
since July but not announced formally.
   Under MCI's Call Europe plan, callers will be charged 59 cents
per minute to call any of 23 Western European nations on weekdays
from 3 p.m. to 8 a.m., and all weekend.
   In the Call Pacific plan, calls may be made to Australia, New
Zealand and eight Asian nations for 79 cents per minute from 10
p.m. to 2 p.m. the following day, and all weekend.
   Call Canada is priced at 19 cents per minute from 5 p.m. to 8
a.m. weekdays and all weekend.
   The plans are expected to be available Jan. 15, said Wayne
Gattinella, MCI vice president for consumer marketing.
   Gattinella said a 10-minute call at 8 p.m. to the United Kingdom
would cost $5.90 under the new plan, compared with current MCI
prices ranging from $8 to $8.50 for the same 10-minute call.
   An evening 10-minute call to France now costs between $7.75 and
$8.25, Gattinella said. On Saturday morning, it now costs about
$8.50.
   AT&amp;T's plan also provides discounts calling to 25 nations for an
additional fee of $3 a month. Reach Out World customers also
receive a 5 percent discount on direct-dialed interstate calls
within the United States, the company said.
   AT&amp;T has offered discounts for calling to Canada for three
years, and to the United Kingdom and the Philippines for the past
two years.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said AT&amp;T had planned to tie a formal
announcement of its international calling plan with a national
advertising campaign due to begin Thursday.
   MCI estimated that residential international calling represents
a $5 billion market and is growing 25 percent annually. It
estimated that 10 percent of U.S. consumers make monthly overseas
calls, with an average duration of 10 minutes.
   Both MCI and AT&amp;T said they planned to add additional countries
to their plans this year.

<HEAD>Ames Eliminates 85 Jobs, Changes Names of 61 Slumping Zayre Stores</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ames Department Stores Inc. on Wednesday
slashed 85 jobs in its corporate offices and announced plans to
eliminate the Zayre name by renaming the last surviving Zayre
stores as Ames outlets.
   The discount retailer, acknowledging that it had overestimated
customer loyalty to the 392 Zayre stores it bought in 1988, also
announced Wednesday that a sluggish fourth quarter will prevent the
company from showing a profit this year.
   Ames, still adjusting to the acquisition of the Zayre chain,
announced last month that it was closing 18 stores, mostly in the
Northeast. Ames bought Zayre Corp.'s discount store division for
$778 million in October 1988.
   By renaming the last 61 Zayre stores, Ames will eliminate the
expense of separate advertising campaigns and will streamline
delivery systems, the company said.
   Ames President Peter B. Hollis blamed the disappointing fourth
quarter on the stagnant Northeast economy, soft sales at Zayre
stores and an unusually competitive holiday selling season.
   The retailer lost $22.6 million in the first nine months of
1989, but had been predicting a profit for the year.
   The company offered no estimate of its fourth quarter earnings.
L. Wayne Hood, a retail analyst for Prudential Bache Securities,
estimated that Ames would earn $19.5 million in the fourth quarter
to close out the year with a net loss of about $3.1 million.
   ``Our profit shortfall is due entirely to a sales shortfall at
the acquired stores, despite a significant reduction in the Zayre
historic expense level,'' Hollis said in a statement issued from
the company's Rocky Hill, Conn., headquarters. ``The Ames stores
continue to perform well.''
   Citing the uncertain economy, Hollis said the company is taking
the following steps:
   _Elminating 325 positions from its planned total of 2,100 jobs
at corporate offices in Rocky Hill and West Hartford, Conn. About
240 of those jobs were never filled, so 85 people will lose their
jobs immediately, Ames spokesman Bill Roberts said.
   _Reducing the company's capital investment budget for the year
ending Jan. 26, 1991.
   _Renaming the remaining 61 Zayre stores as Ames stores. Ames
closed 74 Zayre stores shortly after buying the chain, renamed 254,
and left 61 as Zayre stores, mostly in Chicago, Miami, and the
Baltimore-Washington areas. The company thought at the time that
the Zayre name was popular with inner-city consumers, especially
minorities.
   ``We thought that there was (customer loyalty),'' Roberts said.
``Our original idea was to use that loyalty as a base to build on.
Quite frankly, the name didn't seem to matter at all. We think that
using the Ames name instead will eliminate all confusion.''
   Ames, with 690 discount stores in 20 states, is the nation's
fourth largest discount retailer.
   Hood, the Prudential Bache analyst, said Ames must remodel many
of its stores, especially former Zayre stores, to stay competitive
in the 1990s. The company plans to remodel 65 stores this year,
replacing long, monotonous racks of clothing with smaller, X-shaped
display racks, wider aisles and brighter, more colorful displays.
   ``In order for them to make this thing work, they need to get a
major portion of the remodeling done,'' Hood said. ``I don't really
see them turning the corner until 1991 or 1992.''
   Ames stock lost 87{ cents in consolidated New York Stock
Exchange trading Wednesday, closing at $8.12{.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which soared to a series
of record highs at the close of 1989, has marked the new year with
a lengthy dive, pushed along by rumors, speculation and general
financial market pessimism.
   Between the opening of 1990 trading on Jan. 4 and the market's
close on Wednesday, the key 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell
1,219 points, or 3.1 percent, from its record close of 38,915.87 at
the end of 1989.
   The drop included a more than 438-point tumble on Jan. 5 _ the
market's biggest daily decline in nearly 3 months.
   Analysts say rumors and speculation _ not fundamental economic
worries _ have sent the market sliding.
   The Jan. 5 selloff was sparked by reports that Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev had cancelled all appointments with foreign
leaders in January, raising concerns about the possible fallout
from ethnic unrest in the Soviet Union and the rapid pace of change
in Eastern Europe.
   Other market-depressing rumors have included talk that a
prominent Japanese politician faced arrest in an insider stock
trading case.
   ``Whenever market players become pessimistic and markets become
weak, they overwhelmingly react to rumors, and they sell more,''
said Yamaichi Securities analyst Kenji Maeshiro.
   The selloff in stocks also has depressed bond prices and
weakened the yen against the U.S. dollar _ ``a triple low.''
   The dollar has gained 1.90 yen since last year's close of 143.40
yen, despite active dollar-selling by the Bank of Japan to support
the yen.
   The futures price for 10-year government bonds has dropped some
4 yen and fell below the 100-yen level for the first time since
September 1988. That drop stemmed from fears that the yen's decline
would mean higher inflation _ a weaker yen raises costs of imported
fuel and raw materials _ and higher interest rates, said Seiki
Inami, a bond analyst with Sanwa Bank.
   ``A little selling by some investors earlier this year
accelerated selling by others, who had kept bonds for too long
waiting for a chance to sell,'' Inami said.
   After Wednesday's session, the stock exchange announced it was
easing regulations on margin trading to encourage buying and
rejuvenate the market. Beginning Thursday, traders could count
securities used as collateral in margin trading at 60 percent of
their real value, up from the previous 50 percent.
   Yamaichi's Maeshiro speculated the stock market could recover
soon, because it has fallen back to the level it held before its
year-ending spurt.
   ``But there is little hope for the recovery unless the foreign
exchange and the bond markets are restabilized,'' he said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference
Wednesday that exchange rates cannot long stay out of line with
economic fundamentals, and that the best response is coordinated
intervention by the Group of Seven countries _ the United States,
Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
   Mieno said he was not worried about the stock market plunge
because the index merely had fallen back to its level of early
December.
   Yoshio Shimoyama, a Nikko Securities dealer, also saw the
downturn as a temporary price adjustment.
   ``The market needed some speed and price adjustments after the
surge, so that it can rise again,'' Shimoyama said.
   Still, analysts expect some nervousness to remain in the market
at least until national elections for the lower house of
Parliament, expected in February.
   The pro-business Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority in
the less powerful upper house last July as voters showed their
dissatisfaction over a new 3 percent sales tax and a series of
money and sex scandals.
   The governing party has rebounded in public opinion polls since
then, and the popularity of the opposition Socialists has declined.
But questions remain over whether the LDP can keep its majority in
the lower house, which has the decisive voice in adopting the
budget and naming the prime minister.

<HEAD>Hewlett-Packard Annouces New Multiprocessor Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. on Wednesday announced 13
new computer systems and 11 computer servers that allow customers
to link personal computers to minicomputers.
   The computers and servers all operate on the cutting-edge
reduced-instrution-set architecture.
   Reducted instruction set, or RISC, computers achieve higher
computing speeds by simplifying computer operations.
Hewlett-Packard said that with its new models, it offers the
broadest line of RISC computers in the industry.
   Hewlett-Packard added models to its low-end, midrange and
high-end computer lines. It said the new models triple the
performance of its computers.
   It added five computers to its 9000 model line, which it said
gives it the industry's largest computer family based on the
increasingly popular Unix operating standard.
   Unix is a computer operating system developed by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. Operating software controls the basic
functions of a computer, such as recognizing keystrokes and
executing commands. Using the same operating system allowers
customers with different brands of computers to plug them into the
same network.
   The new computer servers, also RISC-based, allow customers to
integrate their personal computers and workstations based on the
Unix system into computer networks.
   Computer servers are centralized units that provide access to
software, data bases and electronic mail programs that are shared
by all computers, called clients, hooked into a network.
   Robert Herwick, an industry analyst at the San Francisco
brokerage Hambrecht &amp; Quist, praised the new products.
   ``HP with this announcement shows they are more aggressively
pursuing the newer approaches to computing for the 90s,'' he said.
   ``The client-server model is clearly the model for the '90s,''
he said. ``That is displacing, replacing the old minicomputer.''
   Hewlett-Packard, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., also
announced new software at a news conference here that is for use in
client-server computer networks using personal computers.
   Hewlett-Packard also announced date-storage products, including
new disc drives that reduce the cost of storing information and a
disc drive based on digital audio tape technology.

   Domestic coal production totaled 12.2
million tons during the week ending Dec. 30, down 21 percent from
the 15.5 million tons produced in the previous week, the Energy
Department reported Tuesday.
   The U.S. coal industry produced 13.4 million tons in the same
week last year, according to the department's Energy Information
Administration.
   Wyoming ranked first among the 27 coal-producing states with 3
million tons produced. West Virginia was second at 1.43 million
tons and Kentucky was third at 1.41 million tons, the agency said.
   Domestic coal production in 1989 was 965 million tons, 4.6
percent ahead of 1988 production. The production accounts for
bituminous and lignite coal.
   When sub-bituminous and anthracite coal was added, 1989
production was 975 million tons, 25 million tons more than 1988,
according to the National Coal Association.

<HEAD>Company That Says It Can Rescue Bond Lost Its License in October
1987</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company through which a young
entrepreneur hopes to gain control of Bond Corp. Holdings Inc. lost
its corporate license in 1987 after failing to file its annual list
of officers, according to Nevada state records.
   Weatherby Investments Inc. has never been reinstated as a
corporation, according to documents provided Wednesday to The
Associated Press by the office of the Nevada secretary of state.
   Jeff Reynolds, a 28-year-old Texan who identifies himself as the
chairman of Weatherby, has said he can inject as much as $197
million in new capital in return for control of Bond.
   The huge Australian brewing and media conglomerate is near
collapse under the weight of $6 billion in debt. Reynolds insisted
Wednesday that he had lined up the money, and said he was trying to
negotiate additional financing to service that huge debt load.
   But he refused to reveal even in general terms the sources of
his financing, and he described the lapsed corporate license as a
``screw up'' by his staff or attorneys.
   ``I don't know about it. It's not the kind of thing I deal with.
It's something you should talk to the legals about,'' he said.
``It's something that's embarrassing to me and there's going to be
some heads roll.''
   Asked if one of his attorneys could be made available to discuss
the lapsed license, he said, ``Personally, I don't think it's worth
it.''
   Reynolds, a virtual unknown on the investment scene, made the
offer last week through Weatherby and what he claims is its parent,
Singapore-based California Pacific International Pte Ltd., which he
also said he controls. He spoke in a telephone interview from his
mother's house in Houston.
   Reynolds earlier claimed that shares in Weatherby were publicly
traded, but securities officials said they had no record of that.
In addition, the address he gave for the company in Los Angeles
turned out to be a mail drop.
   Utah records show Weatherby was incorporated in that state in
1984, and as of January 1986 had the stated purpose of investing
and engaging in ``any and all'' other businesses.
   In March 1986 it was reincorporated in Nevada under the same
name, with Reynolds' father, L. George Reynolds of Dallas, as
president.
   The corporation missed its annual re-filing in January 1987, and
was listed as delinquent until September 1987, when its standing
was revoked, according to the Nevada secretary of state.
   Jeff Reynolds said that when his father ran the company, its
assets were Oklahoma oil and gas properties.
   He said he took control in summer 1988, his father stepped down
as a director in December 1988, the company became a ``shell''
company for a time, and it now has his holdings rather than his
father's.
   The company's holdings now include Canadian and U.S. oil, gas
and mining operations, some Texas real estate, and some businesses
in Thailand that are not held by the parent California Pacific
International, he said.
   The last figures released publicly, on March 31, showed
Weatherby with $93 million in shareholders' equity, about $100
million in assets, and little debt, Reynolds said.
   He said that since then, both debt and equity have risen sharply
as he transferred assets into Weatherby. ``We're a $300 million
organization now,'' he contended.

<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
Thursday, while the U.S. dollar moved marginally lower against the
Japanese yen.
   The dollar was changing hands at 145.20 yen at late morning. It
started trading at 145.23 yen, down 0.07 yen from Wednesday's
145.30-yen close here, and moved from 145.20 to 145.50 yen. It
ended at 145.55 yen in New York overnight.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 87.86 points, or 0.23
percent, ending the morning session at 37,608.65. It shed 254.95
points Wednesday.
   The Nikkei index headed higher on broad small-lot buying
earlier, due to relaxed regulations on margin trading, dealers said.
   The stock exchange Thursday began assessing securities used as
collateral in margin trading at 60 percent of their real value
rather than the previous 50 percent in a step to encourage buying
and to rejuvenate the market.
   But the index fell back as institutional investors stepped to
the sidelines, said Kazumasa Iijima, a dealer with Nippon Kangyo
Kakumaru Securities Co.
   ``Market players just are not in a buying mood, mainly because
of uncertainties over the election,'' he said.
   A national election for the lower house of Parliament is
expected in February, and the market is largely concerned with
whether the governing Liberal Democratic Party can retain its
majority in the house.
   The LDP lost its majority in the less powerful upper house last
year as a result of money and sex scandals involving the party's
Cabinet members, and an unpopular consumption tax.
   In currency trading, the dollar-yen rate was moving narrowly
after a surge in the dollar earlier this week. Sentiment for the
dollar remained bullish, but market players were reluctant to push
the U.S. currency higher for fear of another central bank
intervention, said Toaru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New
Japan Securities Co.
   The Bank of Japan has actively sold the dollar in the past two
days to support the yen.
   Market rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board sold the
dollar for yen Wednesday, and news about the resignation of the
executive vice president and chief financial officer of Campeau
Corp., also accelerated the market's wait-and-see mood, Kanai said.
   Campeau, a Canadian real estate company that owns U.S.
department store chains, including Bloomingdale's, has been in
financial trouble and there is speculation its department store
units would file for bankruptcy protection.
   ``But the dollar is basically strong as buying of the (West
German) mark has slowed while the yen isn't attracting anybody,''
Kanai added.

   A federal judge Tuesday dismissed a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit alleging that Ford Motor Co. did not
warn of seat-belt dangers to minors. The lawsuit was settled out of
court.
   The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in May 1987 by
Katherine M. Ward of Eaton, whose 10-year-old daughter was
paralyzed after an accident involving a 1979 Ford Bronco.
   The suit originally asked for $24.5 million. But according to
court documents, portions of the suit were settled earlier,
apparently leaving Ms. Ward asking Ford for $15 million.
   Terms of the settlement were kept secret. Ms. Ward's attorney,
Dwight Brannon, declined to comment.
   ``We believe there was nothing about the Ward vehicle ... that
caused or contributed to the injuries of its occupants,'' Ford
spokesman Mark Miller said.
   The suit alleged that Ford was negligent in failing to warn
users that shoulder harnesses can cause neck injuries to minors
when they are fastened crossing the upper torso near the neck.
   According to the suit, Ms. Ward's daughter, Jessica Wilkin, was
a front-seat passenger in a Bronco owned by her stepfather, Herbert
Ward, when the accident occurred on Aug. 22, 1983.
   The suit alleges that her neck became entangled in the safety
harness after Ward lost control of the vehicle and it left the
road, rolling over several times. The girl suffered neck and spinal
cord injuries and is now a quadriplegic, the suit said.
   The suit also alleges that the Bronco was defective because it
had an improperly high center of gravity that made it unstable and
unsafe for turning corners.
   The suit originally asked for damages for Ward and two other
Ward children who were injured in the accident.
   In court documents, Ford has denied any liability, saying its
product was properly designed and manufactured and contained no
defects. The company also denied that it had any duty to issue a
warning or that any alleged lack of warning caused any injury.

   Hospitals are not entitled to sue states in
federal court seeking higher reimbursements for serving Medicaid
patients, the state of Virginia argued Tuesday in the Supreme Court.
   Such lawsuits belong in state courts, Virginia said.
   The Virginia Hospital Association, suing the state, says 95
acute care hospitals in Virginia will lose $1 million a week by
providing care to Medicaid patients at state-set rates that fail to
cover costs.
   Thirty-five states have filed briefs in support of Virginia.
   A provision approved by Congress in 1981 says a state must pay
for hospital services under rates which ``the state finds, and
makes assurances satisfactory'' to the federal government ``are
reasonable and adequate.'' The rates must ``meet the costs'' of
``efficiently and economically operated hospitals,'' it adds.
   R. Claire Guthrie, deputy attorney general for Virginia, said
the ``labyrinthian language'' of the amendment provides states with
wide latitude in Medicaid rate-making.
   Under questioning by Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia,
Guthrie said medical providers in Virginia may sue in state court
if they want higher reimbursements.
   The amendment ``interjects private enterprise'' into the
Medicaid reimbursement process by promoting efficiency and the law
grants ``no substantive set of rights'' to health care providers,
said Guthrie.
   The U.S. solicitor general's office supported the state of
Virginia, saying in a court brief that Congress ``deliberately
sought to avoid saddling state reimbursement decisions with
cumbersome federal oversight.'' The solicitor general said it isn't
plausible to suggest that Congress expected hospitals to enforce
their own views of Medicaid rate-setting with lawsuits in federal
court.
   Walter Dellinger, representing the hospital association, said
``there is not one word in the legislation'' saying that ``we are
extinguishing the right to sue.''
   ``That is, in this case, the dog that did not bark,'' said
Dellinger, referring to a famous case of the fictional detective
Sherlock Holmes in which the failure of a watchdog to bark provided
the essential clue.
   In Colorado, Dellinger said, officials set up a Medicaid
reimbursement rate structure and then simply cut it in half by
multiplying everything by 0.54.
   ``It's like they multiplied by last Tuesday's Trifecta number,''
Dellinger told court.
   Colorado officials argued that only a Medicaid recipient could
sue. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver rejected their
claim in September.
   The appeals court argued that Colorado's Medicaid system
violates federal law because it reimburses hospitals for less than
the costs of serving Medicaid patients.
   If Virginia's Medicaid reimbursement system cannot be
challenged, hospitals will be forced to raise their charges to
other patients in order to cover costs, argued the state hospital
association.
   At stake is the ``viability of mainstream health care for
America's poor,'' Laurens Sartoris, the Virginia association's
president, told reporters Monday.
   In a brief filed at the Supreme Court, the state of Virginia
said ``the original and sole continuing purpose of the Medicaid Act
is to create a program which is designed to pay for medical care
for the eligible poor.
   ``Nothing in the legislative history of the Act contains even a
suggestion that Congress intended providers to be its beneficiaries
or to have privately enforceable rights.''
   The Virginia case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 26 in U.S.
District Court in Richmond. The Supreme Court rejected a request by
the state to delay the trial pending a decision by the justices.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
proceeding with plans to allow the multiple-exchange listing of new
options later this month, commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden
said Tuesday.
   But Breeden also asked the nation's options exchanges to delay
voluntarily their phase-in of multiple listing of existing options
until June 30, to allow extra time to come up with a system for
linking the various options trading marketplaces.
   The letter was disclosed well after office hours Tuesday and
spokesmen for most of the five exchanges contacted by Breeden were
unreachable for comment.
   But in New York, American Stock Exchange Chairman James R. Jones
issued a statement saying he would ``cooperate fully with Chairman
Breeden and the SEC.''
   An option contract is the right to buy or sell a certain
security at a specified price for a set period of time. Options are
traded on stocks listed on exchanges or traded over-the-counter via
computer.
   Most options on the stocks listed on an exchange now can be
traded only in one marketplace at a time. The privilege for trading
a specific option, assigned by lottery, is not permitted on any
other exchange.
   But a controversial rule passed by the SEC last May would
abolish the limitations on multiple trading of options.
   All new options listed for trading after Jan. 22, 1990 could be
traded on any options exchange.
   The new rule, known as 19c-5, also calls for the phasing in of
options previously traded only on one exchange. By Jan. 22, each
options exchange would be allowed to list up to 10 options already
listed on other exchanges.
   As of January 1991, the rule would allow the multiple trading of
all options, including those now in existence.
   But in a letter to the heads of the American Stock Exchange, the
Chicago Board Options Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the
Pacific Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Breeden
asked them voluntarily not to seek to listing the 10 existing
options they would be allowed ``on or before June 30, 1990.''
   Breeden, in his four-page letter to the exchanges, said the
commission had the authority to require development of a specific
options exchange linkage facility.
   But, he said, ``It would be preferrable for such a system to be
designed by the options markets themselves on a joint basis, rather
than being directed by the commission,''
   Breeden left for Paris shortly after the letter's release to
attend a conference of international securities regulators.
   While asking the exchanges to voluntarily refrain from phasing
in the old options, Breeden said, ``If one or more of the exchanges
indicate an intention to preclude, delay or frustrate development
of a linkage system, the commission will consider appropriate
action.''

   Accounting firms that handle the books of most
publicly traded U.S. companies will be subject to tougher industry
review of their auditing practices under a new industry rule.
   The rule approved Tuesday by members of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants marked the culmination of the
group's four-year effort to mandate quality control in the
profession.
   The measure requires firms that have even one publicly traded
company as a client to submit to review of their methods by other
firms, so-called peer review, every three years.

   Oil production by OPEC nations surged
to an average of 23.7 million barrels a day in the final quarter of
1989, the highest level since early 1981.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report released Tuesday that the 13 nations of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries increased output by about 100,000
barrels a day in December to 23.9 million barrels a day, the

   The UAL board of directors announced Monday it had instructed
its financial adviser, First Boston Corp., to explore the merits of
recapitalizing the company. The company plans to present a proposal
at its next board meeting, set for Jan. 25.
   Such a recapitalization might be used to raise cash for a

   Three years after officials of Time Inc. and

businesses, the two companies are sealing their $14 billion merger
and forming the world's largest media concern.
   Time Warner is expected to have $11.4 billion in revenue this

the world's biggest media company.
   But the new company will be burdened with nearly $11 billion in
debt, mostly as a result of the merger, which supplanted Time and

   The Bush administration still is evaluating
financing methods for its savings and loan industry bailout and
will dodge the crucial issue when it releases its 1991 budget later
this month, administration officials said.
   The choice and timing of bailout financing is potentially
explosive because it could swing the federal budget deficit by tens
of billions of dollars. That could make it nearly impossible to
meet the deficit target under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction
law, set at $64 billion for fiscal 1991.
   Administration officials have narrowed the financing options,
but they will not be able to meet a Jan. 15 deadline set two months
ago, three administration officials said Tuesday.

   America's two most admired corporations are its
biggest maker of pharmaceuticals and its largest producer of
cigarettes, according to a Fortune magazine poll.
   For Merck &amp; Co., it was the fourth consecutive year the drug
maker has topped the magazine's ranking of the most-admired large
companies in the United States.
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's biggest consumer products
company with a stable of brands that includes Marlboro cigarettes
and Kraft foods, improved to the No. 2 position from fourth last
year.
   The two companies stood out in a ranking of 305 companies based
on a survey of more than 8,000 directors, the magazine said
Tuesday. The companies were rated in eight separate categories.
   The biggest casualty on this year's list was Exxon Corp., which
plummeted to No. 110. It was ranked sixth last year, before the
Alaskan oil spill.
   Merck came out on top overall after being voted the best in
terms of its innovativeness, ability to attract and keep talented
people, financial soundness and the quality of its products and
services.
   Philip Morris finished a close second and was cited as the best
company in terms of its quality of management and its value as a
long-term investment. The company's shares gave investors an
average total return of 30.1 percent a year from 1979 to 1989, the
magazine said.
   The rest of the top 10 was rounded out by Rubbermaid Inc.,
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co.,
PepsiCo, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Anheuser-Busch Inc.
and Du Pont.
   The inclusion of the three biggest U.S. beverage companies in
the top 10 was ``a tribute to their ability to gain global market
share without choking off profit growth,'' Fortune said.
   International Business Machines, which was ranked most admired
until Merck displaced it in 1986, fell 11 places to No. 45 in the
latest rankings.
   Not surprisingly in a year when the savings and loan crisis made
headlines, the least admired company in the survey was Gibraltar
Financial Corp. of California. The Beverly Hills, Calif., company's
Gibraltar Savings thrift lost $322 million in the April-June
quarter alone last year and has been taken over by federal
regulators.

   Two major newspapers are fighting a request for
a gag order by Eastern Airlines' creditors, who seek to stop press
leaks in the beleaguered airline's 10-month-old bankruptcy
proceeding.
   The latest tangle in the Eastern saga pits the creditors
committee against The New York Times and Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher
of the Wall Street Journal, and centers on unauthorized disclosure
of creditor opinions.
   If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland grants the creditor
committee request, violators could be held in contempt of court.
The Times and Dow Jones say a gag order would violate First
Amendment guarantees and prevent reporting on a story in which much
of the information has been derived from tips and leaks.
   Attorneys for the Times and Dow Jones have sent letters to
Lifland, who is scheduled to hear the case Jan. 30. The Times has
filed legal briefs. Dow Jones expects to do so by the Jan. 15
deadline, spokesman Roger May said Tuesday.
   Eastern workers struck last March in an emotional walkout that
almost immediately sent the moneylosing airline into bankruptcy
court. Pilots and flight attendants quit the strike in November but
Machinists union members remain out.
   The pilots, Machinists and flight attendants unions, who are
represented on the creditors' committee, plan to support the
panel's position, union attorneys said. Eastern also will support
the creditors' request to the court, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell
said from the airline's headquarters in Miami.
   All creditors committee members agreed last spring to keep
information discussed by the panel confidential.
   In their documents, the Times and Dow Jones said courts must
follow specific guidelines before restraining media access in a
case. Their attorneys argue that the creditors' request doesn't
meet those guidelines.
   ``The proposed order would, without any showing of need,
judicially silence hundreds of potential speakers and would
undoubtedly deprive the public of informed views perhaps at odds
with the `party line' of the (creditors) committee itself,'' the
Times says in its brief. ``It crosses all of the established
barriers to prior restraint.''
   The Times also argues that the creditors' request would be
ineffective and unenforceable, and suggests the news leaks haven't
come from the creditors committee.
   In addition to the Air Line Pilots Association, the Machinists
and the Transport Workers Union, other members of the creditors'
committee include: Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft
consortium; General Electric Co.; Boeing Co.; United Technologies
Credit Corp.; Rolls-Royce Credit Corp.; Marriott Corp.; and AT&amp;T
Communications.

<HEAD>Campeau Mulls Options as Payment Deadline Looms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp., facing a deadline today to pay for merchandise
shipped to its department stores for the Christmas season,
continued to study options to cope with its financial crisis.
   The embattled Canadian company has looked into the possibility
of postponing the deadline by informally asking certain suppliers
if they would be willing to wait for their payments.
   There has been widespread speculation among apparel makers,
cosmetics companies and other suppliers that Campeau would not be
able to pay its bills for goods sent to its U.S. stores between
Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   It is seen as a strong possibility that Campeau will put its
U.S. retail divisions under bankruptcy court protection from
creditors.
   ``We have been unofficially approached to find out if key
vendors would agree to step aside or wait 90 days as a means of
staving off bankruptcy while they wait to restructure,'' a
spokeswoman for the cosmetics company Estee Lauder Inc., who asked
not to be identified, said Tuesday.
   Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman at Campeau's corporate
communications office in Cincinnati, confirmed that conversations
have taken place between the company and certain suppliers.
   But she said the possibility of extending the deadline on its
merchandise bills was among numerous things the company was
considering, but that no decisions had been made.
   Sanger said Campeau's board of directors met again Tuesday at
the company's headquarters in Toronto. The board also met Monday.
   The sole announcement to emerge from the Toronto office by late
Tuesday was word that two new members had been elected to Campeau's
board. Both were nominees of the National Bank of Canada, which
acquired a 29 percent stake in Campeau last week after Chairman
Robert Campeau defaulted on a bank loan to two of his private
investment companies.
   The addition of the two members increased the size of Campeau's
board to 12. The new members are Claude Ducharme, a partner in the
Montreal law firm of Desjardins Ducharme, and Roger Smock, senior
vice president for real estate and corporate banking-U.S. at the
National Bank of Canada.
   Several executives at clothing companies said they had not had
any contact with officials from Campeau or its two U.S. retail
divisions, Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores
Inc., both based in Cincinnati.
   But they indicated they would not agree to a delay in getting
paid.
   ``We would have a very strong negative on that. We expect to get
paid at the proper time and have no reason to extend ourselves any
further than we have,'' said one executive at an apparel
manufacturing company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Clothing manufacturers for the most part have suspended
shipments to Campeau-owned stores while awaiting a clearer picture
on Campeau's financial condition. Federated and Allied have warned
they might be placed under bankruptcy court protection.
   Norman Fryman, president and chief operating officer of the
Greif Cos., an apparel supplier, echoed the sentiment of others
when he said, ``Our feeling right now is probably the best thing
that they could do is to go for a Chapter 11 filing'' under the
federal bankruptcy code.
   Companies that file Chapter 11 can continue to operate and
reorganize while under court supervision and protection from
creditors.
   Today's deadline was the first of two days of reckoning for the
debt-encumbered Canadian retailer and property developer.
   By Monday, Campeau must persuade a group of banks that Federated
and Allied are solvent. The banks, which had threatened to declare
a loan of $2.34 billion in default last week, gave Campeau until
Monday to prove its case.
   Campeau amassed heavy debts in acquiring Federated for $6.6
billion in 1988 and Allied for $3.4 billion in 1986. The two store
groups have more than $7 billion in debt related to the takeovers,
some of it in loans from bank lenders and some in high-interest
``junk'' bonds.
   In September, Campeau disclosed that Federated and Allied were
running short of operating cash. The Canadian real estate company
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. provided a $250 million loan to
keep the stores afloat.
   Campeau's stock edged up 36 Canadian cents to close at $2.96
Tuesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In over-the-counter U.S.
trading, Campeau gained 31\ cents to close at $2.68}.
   Federated's chains include Abraham and Straus, Bloomingdale's _
which has been put up for sale _ Burdines, Lazarus and Rich's.
Allied operates The Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh, Maas Brothers and
Stern's.

<HEAD>Government Looking at Phone Service in the Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has begun an inquiry into
whether basic telephone service in the future should include
technical innovations such as call-forwarding and access to data
and video networks.
   Sure to fuel an intense turf battle among the phone, cable,
broadcast, satellite and newspaper industries going into the next
century, the Bush administration said Tuesday it wants to have a
policy in place a year from now.
   Assistant Commerce Secretary Janice Obuchowski said the key
issues are how, how fast and which various elements of the industry
can best improve U.S. competitiveness and the quality of life in a
growingly information-based world economy.
   ``The one thing Americans don't have enough of is time,'' she
said. ``The one thing they seem to be looking for is a simpler way
of life ... without simply turning back the clock.''
   In a 99-page notice published Tuesday, the policy-advising
National Telecommunications and Information Administration that Ms.
Obuchowski heads said it wants fresh comments within the next 90
days from the industry.
   Among the key questions, she said, is whether an emerging
infrastruture of fiber optics, satellites, cellular phone systems,
fax machines and other technologies is advancing fast enough on its
own or requires, in effect, a government-sponsored
telecommunications ``industrial policy.''
   ``In the United States we have relied on customer pull or demand
to set the pace for technology deployment,'' she said. ``Some of
our strategic competitors worldwide have rather more strongly
relied on government push in setting the pace.''
   Japan, for example, has set a goal of having a fully fiber-optic
nationwide voice and data transmission system in operation within
the next decade.
   And the French telephone system already has electronic directory
services that, for example, allow callers to ring up various
merchants with a home computer and compare prices for a particular
item they want to buy.
   The study will tackle head-on issues that have widely divided
the telecommunications industry since the government-ordered
breakup of the Bell System in 1984.
   Among them are whether the seven regional ``Baby Bell''
companies that were spun off AT&amp;T into separate enterprises should
be allowed to transmit video signals across their lines, a move
that could put them into direct competition with the TV cable
industry.
   Another is a current prohibition that allows regional phone
companies to act as a carrier of data services but not as an
originator. The phone companies are challenging those restrictions
in the U.S. Court of Appeals and legislation is pending in Congress
that would remove them.
   The prohibitions, however, are supported by the newspaper
industry, which has expressed fears that the phone companies would
take advantage of their monopoly position to undercut their
advertising market.
   For example, a person or store wanting to sell a refrigerator
could simply punch that information on a computer in his home or
office for a fee and a potential buyer wanting to compare prices
and features could dial up the data base and do so.
   ``A lot of the issues tend to be polarizing,'' Ms. Obuchowski
acknowledged. ``We're trying to see the forest for the trees. The
people who have to resolve these ultimtely _ the Congress, the
courts, the Federal Communications Commission _ really ought to be
focusing on what's good for the economy. That's what we're trying
to do here.''

   Oil production by OPEC nations surged
to an average of 23.7 million barrels a day in the final quarter of
1989, the highest level since early 1981, according to estimates.
   The International Energy Agency said Tuesday in its Monthly Oil
Market Report that the 13 nations of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries increased output by about 100,000 barrels a day
in December to 23.9 million barrels a day, the highest all year.
   The surge in OPEC output led by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates topped the cartel's self-imposed production
ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day in the October-December
period.
   It also was above the new limit of 22 million barrels a day
which OPEC oil ministers recently set for the first half of this
year. OPEC officials will meet again in March to review market
conditions.
   OPEC's supply to the market in the last three months of 1989 was
the highest since it produced 24.8 million barrels a day in the
first quarter of 1981.
   The producing nations have been able to widen their taps without
sending prices tumbling because of stronger-than-expected demand
among consuming nations. Refinery delays in non-OPEC producing
regions also have reduced world supplies.
   In September, for example, Amerada Hess Corp.'s huge refinery in
St. Croix, Virgin Islands was heavily damaged by Hurricane Hugo and
forced to shut down for several weeks. Last month, an explosion
temporarily stalled operations at Exxon Corp.'s Baton Rouge, La.
refinery.
   Indeed, prices have soared in recent weeks above the cartel's
target of $18 a barrel. The average price for a basket of seven
crudes monitored by OPEC reached $20.46 a barrel last week.
   The futures price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
American crude, has been in the range of $21 to $23 a barrel.
   Nick Antill, an analyst at County NatWest in London, predicted
prices would fall because of warmer weather in the United States
and excess supplies of OPEC oil.
   The energy agency report estimated demand for the cartel's oil
would run slightly more than 21 million barrels a day in the first
half of this year.
   Private analysts expect the cartel to reduce production in
January but not enough to bring it in line with the new supply cap
of 22 million barrels a day.
   Antill predicted output would be just slightly under 23 million
barrels a day this month. Lucy Mullins, an analyst at the
London-based Barclays de Zoete Wedd, also expects production to run
about that level.
   Antill said the cartel's supply would likely stay strong because
of the attractiveness of higher prices to the producing nations.
   Moreover, he said, it appeared Saudi Arabia, the cartel's
biggest producer, was determined to maintain its one-quarter
percent share of OPEC's total production. To do that, the kingdom
would have to increase its output if other countries did.
   The energy agency report estimated that Saudi Arabia produced
5.6 million barrels a day in December. Its output quota was about 5
million barrels a day in the last quarter of the year.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, was quoted recently
by the cartel's OPECNA news agency as saying the country was
producing 5.4 million barrels a day, right at its limit for the
first half of the year.
   The report estimated Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
considered OPEC's troublesome quota-cheaters, produced at about
double their quotas in December.
   The production agreement arranged for the January-June period
set Kuwait's quota at 1.5 million barrels a day, sharply up from
1.1 million barrels late last year. Kuwait got a bigger share of
OPEC's production pie in an effort to curb its overproduction.
   The United Arab Emirates' quota remained the same.
   The energy agency reported December production by Iran and Iraq
at about their caps of 2.9 million barrels a day for the last
quarter of 1989.
   Indonesia produced about 1.3 million barrels a day; Nigeria, 1.8
million barrels; Algeria, 800,000 barrels, and Venezuela, 1.8
million barrels, the report said.
   Others were: Ecuador, 300,000 barrels a day; Gabon, 200,000
barrels; Libya, 1.2 million barrels, and Qatar, 400,000 barrels.
   The energy agency is an arm of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, formed by two-dozen industrial nations.

<HEAD>EC Drops Anti-Competition Case Against Coca-Cola</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RESTORES missing words in 2nd graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EC Commission said Tuesday it had
closed an anti-competition case against the U.S. soft drink
manufacturer Coca-Cola Co., satisfied that the company had ended
anti-competitive practices throughout the European Community.
   The commission said the undertakings by the U.S. company to end
anti-competitive practices would ensure ``that competition in the
soft-drinks market of the EC will be strengthened'' to the
advantage of both Coca-Cola Co.'s competitors and consumers.
   It added that consumers would ``have the choice between a larger
range of drinks.''
   The commission opened the case in 1987 after receiving
complaints from an Italian soft-drinks manufacturer that Coca-Cola,
which already held a dominant position in the Italian beverages
market, was abusing this position by granting ``fidelity rebates''
to large distribution chains as a reward for selling only Coca-Cola.
   The plaintiff said these rebates obstructed market access for
competitors.
   Coca-Cola agreed to modify its contracts with distributors of
its beverages to no longer provide for any kind of rebate. Although
this undertaking was accepted by the commission it did not close
the case when the modified agreements took effect Jan. 1, 1988,
because it wanted to check that the company did not have
anti-competitive contracts in other EC countries.
   The commission said in a statement Tuesday it was satisfied the
company would no longer include any of the following provisions in
contracts with distributors of its beverages in the 12-nation trade
bloc:
   _Grant distributors rebates or other advantages on condition
that they do not purchase other cola flavored beverages.
   _Grant distributors rebates for buying a target quantity of
Coca-Cola within three consecutive months.
   _Grant distributors rebates for buying a target quantity of both
``Coca-Cola'' and other beverages produced by Coca-Cola Co.
   _Grant rebates if the distributor buys one or more other
beverages produced by Coca-Cola Co. along with Coca-Cola.

<HEAD>Consultant Says May Co. Wants to Buy Rich's, Which Says It Isn't

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consultants say May Department Stores Co. wants
to buy the Rich's department store chain of Atlanta, which is owned
by troubled Campeau Corp. But officials of Rich's said the chain
isn't for sale.
   Atlanta real estate consultant Janis E. Martinez said Tuesday
that two executives of St. Louis-based May have discussed the
company's interest in Rich's with her.
   ``What they said was, `We have a very strong interest in Rich's,
and we are actively pursuing the possibilities that exist,'' said
Mrs. Martinez, president of Ashford Management Group Inc.
   A subsidiary of Campeau, Federated Department Stores Inc., owns
Rich's.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported today that a company official
reiterated that Rich's isn't for sale.
   May, one of the nation's largest merchants with sales last year
of $11.53 billion, operates Lord &amp; Taylor and 12 other department
store chains.
   Retail analyst Edward A. Weller said May has expressed an
interest in several chains operated by Campeau's Allied Stores
Corp. and Federated Department Stores.
   ``May has indicated ... that they are interested in buying
Federated and Allied divisions in Florida, Atlanta, the Midwest and
the Pacific Northwest,'' said Weller, an analyst for Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco.
   May spokesman Jim Abrams declined to comment Tuesday on whether
May wants to buy Rich's, but he said the company historically has
expanded by buying ``strong regional department store companies.''
   May bought the Filene's department store division of Federated,
which operates in New England, after Campeau took over Federated in
1988.
   The newspaper also reported that retail anaylsts said Dillard
Department Stores Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp. may, too, consider
bidding for Rich's. The paper said Dillard's officials couldn't be
reached for comment, and a Dayton Hudson spokeswoman said the
company doesn't comment on such speculation.

<HEAD>Shoppers Guide Hopes To Spark a Retail Revolt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social activists have updated their battle plan
for a would-be shoppers' revolt, issuing a half-inch-thick pocket
guide to the environmental and political records of more than 150
U.S. companies.
   The aim is to encourage manufacturers to pursue progressive
policies, authors of the new edition of ``Shopping for a Better
World'' said Tuesday. The payoff they offer: loyalty from concerned
shoppers.
   ``Many consumers want to buy from socially responsible
companies,'' said Alice Tepper Marlin, head of the Council on
Economic Priorities, the book's publisher. ``What does it take for
that to happen? It takes information.''
   Her group's work, released at a Manhattan news conference,
offers data galore. It lists 1,800 consumer products by brand,
rating their makers in 11 policy categories. Supermarket chains and
oil companies also are scored.
   Which toothpaste maker gives the most to charity? Which
shaving-cream company does business in South Africa? Which pasta
purveyor also produces cigarettes? Which companies have women and
minorities in top management? Which recycle, or offer day care? The
guide advises.
   ``The purpose is to provide an incentive for companies to
improve their social performance,'' Marlin said. ``It's also to
provide a way for people to be more comfortable with their
purchases, to integrate their lifestyles so their market behavior
reflects their value system.''
   A growing group of activists is pushing the notion of spending
with a political purpose, from environmentally aware mail-order
houses to socially sensitive investment funds. But experts on
consumer behavior are split on the key issue: whether enough
consumers care to make a real impact.
   ``If all else is equal, people would prefer to make purchases
based on these secondary objectives,'' said Richard Curtin,
consumer survey director for the Institute for Social Research at
the University of Michigan. ``But in most cases all else isn't
equal.''
   Instead, Curtin's research indicates that most consumers rarely
get past their chief criteria: price and quality.
   Others differ. ``Buying products by the company's ethical
position is going to be the absolute direction in the 1990s,'' said
Faith Popcorn, chairwoman of BrainReserve Inc., which forecasts
consumer trends by studying popular culture. ``People are looking
for the soul behind the logo.''
   One gauge may be the shopping guide's success so far. The first
edition sold 350,000 copies last year, many in bulk sales to groups
that offered it as a membership enticement. The Utne Reader
magazine bought more than 100,000 copies for its subscribers. And
Ballantine Books, confident of an even wider market, is
co-publishing the new edition.
   With those sales, ``it's clear that a lot of people are thinking
this way,'' said Roland Rust, a marketing professor at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville. ``You see socially aware mutual funds. You
see people boycotting companies that create ecological disasters.
... It's quite clear there's something going on.''
   There is other evidence of a growth in concerned shopping. Co-Op
America, a catalog company for goods it regards as socially
responsible, added 15,000 members, for a total of 45,000, last
year. Seventh Generation, whose catalog offers environmentally
sound products, says it's filling 1,000 orders per week.
   Still, there is at least one pitfall to socially conscious
shopping: Debate over which policies are appropriate for a company,
and who decides.
   For example, ``Shopping for a Better World'' negatively rates
firms that sell supplies to South African companies. But the U.S.
firms maintain that they're doing good by preserving jobs for
blacks there.
   And there is the case of Eden Foods, a small natural foods
company in Clinton, Mich., that is rated negatively for, among
other things, having no minorities in top management.
   ``The area we live in is very WASP,'' said Martha Johnson,
marketing director for the company. ``We're in a tiny little town
in the country, and there's not much we can do about that.''

<HEAD>MGM-UA Plans To Resume Film Production as Losses Narrow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MGM-UA Communications Co. plans to
re-emphasize film production after its failed efforts to sell
itself to Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch, Australia's Qintex Group and
others.
   The chief interest of most would-be buyers has been the rich
United Artists film library and MGM's lion logo. Many in the
entertainment business had feared the company would be carved up
and movie production end at a studio with two of Hollywood's most
famous names.
   ``We decided it was time to get moving with this company,''
MGM-UA Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow told a shareholders meeting
here Tuesday.
   Barbakow reported that losses in the company's first fiscal
quarter, which ended Nov. 30, narrowed to just more than $2
million. He said the communications giant is now ``100 percent
focused on building our operating entities.''
   Barbakow did not rule out the future sale of all or part of
MGM-UA to Turner or anyone else, but he said, ``At this time we
believe it is not in the shareholders' interest.''
   MGM-UA blamed its first-quarter loss and a $75 million loss for
fiscal 1989 mainly on fewer films in production and release.
Feature film production nearly halted at MGM-UA during the past two
years while billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, the controlling
shareholder, tried to find a buyer.
   The company said it will release at least 15 films this year
beginning in mid-1990, including those produced elsewhere that it
distributes.
   MGM-UA film group President Richard Berger said a production
fund of $170 million to $185 million had been authorized for 1990,
plus a large movie development fund.
   Eight movies with budgets in the $15 million-$25 million range
will be developed, and higher-budget production will begin in the
``Rocky'' and ``James Bond'' series, he said.
   MGM-UA recorded significant gains in operating revenue and
operating income in its first quarter, Barbakow said. But the lack
of new feature films resulted in a net loss for the period.
   The company reported a loss of $2.02 million, or 4 cents a
share, on operating revenue of $211.5 million. For the same period
last year, MGM-UA reported a $39.5 million loss, or 78 cents a
share, against revenue of $170.4 million.
   Turner had been widely reported to be in negotiations for
MGM-UA, and as recently as December the two sides were reported to
be considering a stock swap. Turner was seeking to acquire the
United Artists' film library for his cable television empire, after
having acquired the MGM film library in recent years.
   Barbakow said the company is ``just emerging from a transition
period following the October termination of our merger agreement
with Qintex,'' the Australian company whose $1.5 billion buyout
offer failed for lack of financing. Qintex had outbid Murdoch's
20th Century Fox studio by $100 million.
   MGM-UA's last big releases were ``Rain Man'' and ``Licence to
Kill.''
   The company said the coming releases included ``Stanley and
Iris'' starring Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda; ``Blue Steel,'' a
thriller with Ron Silver and Jamie Lee Curtis; and ``Desperate
Hours,'' a suspense story with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins.
   In addition, MGM-UA said several films are in various stages of
preproduction or development, including Sylvester Stallone's
``Rocky V,'' a comedy starring John Candy called ``Delirious'' and
a film version of Pat Conroy's novel ``Prince of Tides'' starring
and directed by Barbra Streisand.

<HEAD>Accounting Industry Adopts Quality Review Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Accounting firms that handle the books of most
publicly traded U.S. companies will be subject to tougher industry
review of their auditing practices under a rule adopted by a major
professional group.
   The rule approved Tuesday by members of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants marked the culmination of the
group's four-year effort to mandate quality control in the
profession.
   The measure requires firms that have even one publicly traded
company as a client to submit to a review of their methods by other
firms, a so-called peer review, every three years.
   The rule also requires that a report on the reviews be kept in a
public file. The report and the peer review are subject to
oversight from an independent private board, said Charles Kaiser
Jr., this year's chairman of the board of AICPA and chairman of the
accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster.
   Companies that make public offerings of stock or other
securities must register with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and provide accurate and adequate disclosure of certain
facts, including the makeup of the company's management and its
financial condition, a fact that must be certified by independent
public accountants.
   Kaiser said the public oversight board, which consists of
non-accountants, is headed by former SEC Commissioner A.A. Somer.
   The accountants' vote was disclosed at AICPA's 17th annual
conference on Securities and Exchange Commission developments in
Washington. The proposal was approved by two-thirds of the 150,000
members of the AICPA who voted during a 90-day voting period that
ended Monday.
   Officials of the association, which has total membership of some
290,000, say their membership audits 85 percent to 90 percent of
the nation's public companies.
   A similar peer review proposal was submitted to the membership
in 1986. While approved by a simple majority of all those voting,
it did not receive a two-thirds majority as required by the
institute's rules.
   ``It's part of a long effort to improve the self-regulatory
function within the profession,'' said Kaiser.
   The AICPA governs auditing procedures and ethical standards in
the accounting profession. The institute also prepares and grades
the Uniform CPA Examination.
   The rule change requires public accounting firms with AICPA
members to join _ previously it was voluntary _ the institute's SEC
Practice Section if the firm has even one SEC-registered client.
   Individual accountants, not firms, make up the AICPA membership.
But Kaiser said individual accountants could lose their membership
if their firm had a publicly traded client but did not join the SEC
Practice Section.
   One of the requirements for membership in the SEC Practice
Session is submission to review of the firm's accounting methods
every three years.

<TEXT>
   A former printing company employee and an
ex-stockbroker have been charged in a civil complaint with
illegally trading shares based on confidential information from
advance copies of Business Week magazine.
   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $39,000
in alleged profits from the two California men and fines equal to
triple the profit.
   The case was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
and announced by the SEC's New York office.
   The defendants are William N. Jackson, of Long Beach, Calif., a
former employee of a Business Week printer, and Brian J. Callahan,
of Anaheim, Calif., a former broker in the Anaheim office of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The SEC said the case was the fifth civil action _ three of
which have been settled _ that alleged trading based on information
in advance copies of Business Week. Criminal charges also were
filed in some of the earlier cases.
   According to the complaint, Jackson had access to advance copies
of the magazine through his job at R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., which
printed Business Week at a plant in Torrance, Calif.
   Jackson allegedly traded on 49 companies mentioned in the
magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' column between July 1987 and July
1988 and shared the information with his brothers, the SEC said.
Jackson and his brothers allegedly made $19,506 in profits.
   The complaint said Callahan approached Jackson about opening an
account at Prudential-Bache in April 1988, after he learned that
Jackson had advance information from Business Week.
   The SEC said Jackson told Callahan the names of companies
mentioned in upcoming issues of the magazine. Callahan allegedly
purchased securities of seven companies, earning a profit for
himself of $1,148 from April 1988 to July 1988.
   The complaint said he also used the information to place orders
for his customers, who profited by at least $18,535. The SEC
alleged Callahan benefited by his customers' trading because he
earned commissions.
   In August, a former salesman at R.R. Donnelley's Torrance plant,
Shayne A. Walters, pleaded guilty to criminal charges and settled
SEC civil charges that he traded on advance copies of Business
Week. Walters awaits sentencing.
   Also, William Dillon, a former broker for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
Inc., was sentenced to six months in prison for similar charges.
The government charged that he paid various employees at an R.R.
Donnelley plant in Connecticut for advance copies of the magazine.

<HEAD>Justice To File Antitrust Challenge to Gillette-Wilkinson Tie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department plans to file suit to
try to block the Gillette Co.'s attempt to acquire most of
Wilkinson Sword's worldwide razor-blade business.
   The Justice Department on Tuesday said the plans by the nation's
largest manufacturer of razor blades for shaving ``may
substantially lessen competition'' in violation of the Clayton Act
and would pose a ``significant risk'' of higher prices to U.S.
consumers.
   Gillette's acquisition of the non-European operations of
Wilkinson Sword would pose ``a significant threat to competition in
the wet shaving razor blade market in the United States,'' Alison
L. Smith, acting head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division, said in a statement.
   The announcement said the department planned to file its case in
U.S. District Court in Washington.
   ``This acquisition would eliminate one of the only four other
suppliers of blades and would further increase Gillette's dominant
share,'' Ms. Smith said. ``The antitrust laws do not tolerate such
a loss of competition.''
   In Boston, Gillette Senior Vice President and General Counsel
Joseph E. Mullaney said the company was ``very surprised and
disappointed that they are bringing what we consider a precipitous
action.''
   He said competition would not be harmed because other razor
makers such as Shick and Bic would remain in the field.
   ``We're going to tell the court we think this is unnecessary,''
Mullaney said.
   Gillette sold about 65 percent of the nation's blades in 1988;
Wilkinson sold about 3 percent.
   Wilkinson Sword, until recently owned by Stora of Sweden, was
sold to a Dutch corporation in a leveraged buyout partially
financed by Gillette, which is based in Boston.
   The Dutch company in turn has agreed to sell Wilkinson Sword's
business outside the European Common Market to Gillette, the
department said.
   In addition, Gillette will end up with a 22.9 percent non-voting
interest in the newly created Dutch company, Swedish Match BV,
which retained the European business of Wilkinson as well as a
match and lighter business also acquired from Stora.
   The transactions, announced late last month, involved a Gillette
investment of about $155 million, the company said, which includes
$72 million for Wilkinson's non-European business, $14 million for
the stake in Swedish Match and $69 million to help finance the debt
for the transaction.
   The Justice Department announcement came just hours after the
department filed suit in Philadelphia to block the merger of two
industrial razor-blade companies.
   The Justice Department charged in the civil antitrust suit that
American Safety Razor Co.'s acquisition of Ardell Industries Inc.
might lessen competition in industrial blades.
   American Safety Razor, of Verona, Va., and Ardell, based in
Union, N.J., were the nation's largest and second-largest sellers
of industrial single-edge blades for cutting, trimming and scraping.
   ASR bought the outstanding shares of Ardell in April for $12.7
million.

<BYLINE>United's Plans May Be Jeopardized by Recapitalization</BYLINE>

   United Airlines' plans to expand its routes and
buy new aircraft could be jeopardized if UAL Corp. decides to
recapitalize, saddling the parent company with a much larger debt
load, an analyst says.
   The New York Times, meanwhile, citing unidentified sources,
reported in today's editions that UAL's management and unions will
again attempt to assemble a buyout proposal.
   The UAL board of directors announced Monday it had instructed
its financial adviser, First Boston Corp., to explore the merits of
recapitalizing the company.
   Such a recapitalization _ essentially changing the company's
levels of debt and equity _ might be used to raise cash for a
special payment to shareholders.
   UAL plans to present a proposal at its next board meeting, Jan.
25.
   The New York investor group Coniston Partners, which owns 11.8
percent of UAL's stock, has threatened an attempt to oust the
company's board of directors if UAL does not undertake a buyout,
recapitalization or other move to boost its stock value.
   ``I think it (recapitalization) would limit their flexibilty to
finance future expansion and new purchases of airliners,'' said
analyst Robert Decker of the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps
Inc.
   United has about 500 aircraft on order or under option. It
recently announced plans to expand its service to Europe and the
Pacific rim.
   A recapitalization also could add to management-employee
problems. United's pilots have been working without a contract
since 1988 and its contract with flight attendants expired in 1987.
   The New York Times, meantime, said UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf
was scheduled to begin a series of meetings with employees today to
assemble a buyout proposal, which would offer the unions a large
stake in the company.
   But UAL spokesman Rob Doughty said late Tuesday he was not aware
of any new employee buyout plan in the works.
   Meetings of non-union employees were set for today and Thursday,
but these were scheduled earlier as a sounding board for workers to
tell management what they would like to see in an employee stock
ownership plan if one is developed.
   Wolf was not expected to attend the meetings today, Doughty said.
   Unions representing United Airline workers said Tuesday they
continue to favor an employee buyout of the airline and oppose
UAL's decision to explore a recapitalization.
   Diane Robertson, president of the United chapter of the
Association of Flight Attendants, said the union does not believe a
recapitalization ``is in the long-run interests of UAL Corp., its
stockholders or its employees.''
   Added F.C. Dubinsky, chairman of the United chapter of the Air
Line Pilots Association, ``We are strongly opposed to any
restructuring which results in the incurrence of substantial
indebtedness and little or no employee ownership.''
   Officials of the Machinists union did not return telephone calls
to their Washington, D.C., headquarters. The union has said in the
past it opposes any action that would saddle UAL with substantial
debt.
   Ms. Robertson said she expects the flight attendants' advisers
will meet shortly with advisers to the pilots union and the UAL
board to pursue employee ownership.
   Coniston issued a brief statement Tuesday saying its
representatives would closely review the steps taken by UAL's
advisers over the next two weeks to develop a recapitalization plan.
   UAL's board said Monday that among the proposals it wants
studied is a plan that would involve an ``exchange offer of UAL
debt securities for a significant portion of UAL's outstanding
stock.''
   The board did not say how many of its 21 million outstanding
shares might be involved.
   The UAL board said that although no new employee ownership plan
has been put forth, the board remained open to ``any appropriate
acquisition proposal from employees or any other party.''
   A pilot-management plan to buy the company for $6.75 billion, or
$300 a share, failed last fall when banks refused to finance it.
Since then, the company's stock price has fallen sharply.
   UAL shares jumped $7.37{ Tuesday to close at $164 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Paul Tierney, a Coniston principal, said in a telephone
interview Tuesday that the UAL board's decision to study a
recapitalization was what the group wanted.
   If the board fails to adopt a recapitalization plan that is
acceptable to Coniston, its partners would do the next best thing,
Tierney said. He would not elaborate.
   Coniston has said that if there was no sale and if a
recapitalization proposal proved unsatisfactory, it might revive
its threat to seek shareholder consent to oust 13 of UAL's 15
directors and take control of the board.
