   The phone company has introduced
one-way telephones for people who can't pay their bills, in an
apparent show of compassion for the country's record number of
unemployed.
   Unemployment passed 100,000 people last week for the first time
in more than 50 years.
   Due partly to unemployment, the state phone company Televerket
on Wednesday introduced a service that allows slow payers to keep
their phones for incoming calls but not to dial out, said the
national news agency NTB.
   ``In the past, poor payers were exposed to their friends and
family by the phone company's recorded message `this number has
been temporarily disconnected,'' said NTB.
   The state employment directorate said Wednesday that 105,221
Norwegians, or 4.8 percent of the work force, were registered as
unemployed last week. About 50,000 are employed in temporary
government work programs.

<HEAD>State-Funded Company Announces ``Streamlined'' Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company has announced 21
productions for 1990, blaming a cash shortage for its most modest
year since the 1970s.
   ``I regret the reduction in the work, but it will give all our
actors a chance to do their work well,'' artistic director Terry
Hands told a news conference Wednesday.
   He introduced four-theater repertoire ``as streamlined as we can
make it.''
   Hands, 49, is resigning later this year to go freelance. He said
his successor is expected to be named next month and be in place by
April 1.
   Hands attributed the reduced output to a cumulative deficit of
$4.1 million dollars, despite the $1.65 million annually that the
company receives from its internationally successful musical, ``Les
Miserables.'' The company staged 27 productions last year, 32 in
1988, and a record 47 in 1987.
   He said the decision had nothing to do with critics' complaints
that the company has been overextending itself, typically staging
more productions per year than are seen on Broadway all season.
   ``I believe (quantity) is in the RSC's very nature,'' Hands
said. It ``works at its best when going flat out, fizzing on all
cylinders.''
   The company's season opens March 28 with the transfer from
Stratford-upon-Avon of Barry Kyle's staging of Shakespeare's
``All's Well That Ends Well.''
   The production was poorly received in its Stratford opening last
fall. Since then, Hands said, ``It's being refurbished and
retreaded ... People are still working the show to try and improve
it.''
   Then come more transfers from Stratford: ``As You Like It,''
starring Sophie Thompson as Rosalind; ``Coriolanus'' with Charles
Dance in the title role; ``Singer,'' Peter Flannery's controversial
new play, staring Anthony Sher; and John Webster's ``The Duchess of
Malfi,'' with Harriet Walter.
   Two musicals are planned _ a revival of Lionel Bart's 1961
``Blitz,'' directed by Barry Kyle; and ``Children of Eden,'' an
original show with music and lyrics by American composer Stephen
Schwartz (``The Baker's Wife,'' ``Godspell''). John Caird, who
co-directed ``Les Miserables,'' will direct.
   The Stratford season, starting April 10, will include six
Shakespeare plays, beginning with ``Much Ado About Nothing.'' It
will also feature Christopher Marlowe's ``Edward II,'' and a new
play, ``Two Shakespearean Actors,'' by American dramatist Richard
Nelson. His ``Some Americans Abroad'' was a London hit for the
company last summer and opens off-Broadway next month.
   Eagerly awaited is a new ``King Lear,'' starring John Wood as
Lear and directed by Nicholas Hytner, the admired young director of
the musical ``Miss Saigon.'' It opens July 11.
   Hytner and Wood collaborated together last year on an acclaimed
staging of ``The Tempest.''
   Except for John Wood, the new season is noticeably lacking in
stars, fewer of whom can be enticed to work for relatively low pay
over a long period.
   Instead, the company is promoting rising young actors like Ralph
Fiennes, who will play Troilus in ``Troilus and Cressida'' and the
bastard Edmund in ``King Lear,'' among others, and Simon Russell
Beale, the King of Navarre in ``Love's Labours Lost'' and Thersites
in ``Troilus and Cressida.''
   With an 11 percent increase in government funding over last
year, Hands said the level of state subsidy should be 40 percent to
45 percent.
   Taking into account inflation at 7.7 percent, Hands said the
increase gives the company $295,000 in ``new and extra money, about
the cost of one major production on a major stage.''

   The battle to keep Florida's
environment off the terminal list gets a boost this week, as
President Bush plans a visit to the Everglades and leading
conservationists meet to set their agenda.
   Heavily populated South Florida is under mandatory water
restrictions because of its worst drought in three decades, and
state environmentalists say time is running out for ambitious,
expensive efforts to reverse damage caused by runaway growth.
   ``The Everglades is on the critical list. It is the most
threatened ecosystem in the United States,'' said Brien Culhane, a
Wilderness Society official and chairman of the Everglades
Coalition. ``The 1990s will be the decade of decision. The
decisions we make _ and our success in carrying them out _ will
determine whether the Everglades will be saved.''
   The Everglades Coalition, an umbrella group of 25 organizations
that includes the National Audubon Society, Sierra Club and
Wilderness Society, begins its fifth annual meeting Thursday. After
sessions with Florida's top politicians, seminars, and field trips,
the conservationists will announce their agenda for the year.
   Meanwhile, Bush plans a tour and briefing Friday at Everglades
National Park. The main purpose of Bush's six-hour Florida visit is
to keynote a fund-raising dinner in Miami for Republican Gov. Bob
Martinez's November re-election effort, but Martinez likely will
lobby Bush for federal money to help Florida environmental projects.
   The governor is expected here Thursday to endorse an
unprecedented, $276 million backfilling plan to restore the
Kissimmee River to its original, meandering boundaries.
   The Army Corps of Engineers, because of state calls for flood
control, built a 52-mile, 30-feet-deep channel to straighten the
winding 98-mile-long river. But after the channelization was
completed in 1971, pollution of Lake Okeechobee, the major
reservoir of South Florida's freshwater, increased and tens of
thousands of pollution-filtering wetlands were lost along with
substantial numbers of fish and wildlife.
   Estus Whitfield, the governor's chief environmental adviser,
said the state will ask for 80 percent federal funding of the
restoration.
   Bush last month authorized expansion of the Everglades National
Park by 107,600 acres, but state officials want him to push
immediately for funding. Florida will donate 35,000 acres to the
federal park, and has agreed to pay 20 percent of the estimated $40
million cost to acquire the other lands.
   ``When you're talking about getting sizable amounts of federal
funds for any activity, that's tough these days,'' said U.S. Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla.
   Graham and other Florida leaders say the state's projects are
more than environmental idealism.
   Adding wetlands and reversing development not only would protect
the 13 endangered species and dozens of threatened species, but
also could prevent the booming ``Gold Coast'' from Palm Beach to
Miami from becoming a concrete desert.
   About half of South Florida's 4,000 square miles of wetlands
were taken over by urban areas and agriculture after massive
dredging and draining began around the turn of the century.
Florida's population exploded after World War II, more than
quadrupling to nearly 13 million people. Canals and channels were
built for flood control, but changes in natural water flow have
spurred pollution, destroyed wildlife habitats and disrupted
evaporation-and-rainfall cycles.
   South Florida has had its lowest rainfall since 1962 in the past
year, and the water level in Lake Okeechobee, which serves as a
giant reservoir for South Florida, is three feet below normal and
at its lowest on record.
   The dry conditions spur wildfires that push black smoke and ash
over the southeast coast. Choking smoke last spring forced
respiratory alerts and repeated closings of major highways. And the
low water levels can allow ocean saltwater intrusion to underground
aquifers.

   An airline passenger whose unruliness forced an
emergency landing was sent a $2,300 bill for damages, the airline
said.
   Britannia Airways did not identify the man but said Wednesday
that unless he refunded the company's losses by the end of the
month it would take legal action.
   Spokesman Alan Hyde said the man began striking at two women
traveling with him and threatened other people on the charter
flight from the Canary Islands to central England in November.
   The pilot diverted to Lisbon, Portugal, after the crew failed to
calm the man, and police removed him, Hyde said.
   The bill included handling charges incurred at Lisbon and the
extra fuel used to divert the plane, he said.

   The former mayor of this western
Pennsylvania town wonders whether he lost his re-election bid
because voters didn't read the fine print.
   Richard Haddox's name on the November ballot appeared in a
smaller type size than challenger Paul Spickerman's.
   Haddox lost by two votes.
   Haddox wrote to the Beaver County Board of Elections pointing
out the type size difference. He decided not to challenge the
outcome, but he suggested the board investigate the matter and
release its findings.
   `` ... The variation in print size is suspicious and tends to
raise questions about the integrity of the election and the process
of printing the ballots,'' Haddox said.
   Elections board Chairman Chester Szurley said the company that
printed the ballots admitted the varied type size was its decision
because of space constraints.
   Szurley said each candidate must review a sample ballot prior to
an election. He said Haddox apparently did not notice the type size
difference then.

   A commercial for submarine sandwiches ended
with a kicker for 18-year-old Katie Ryan: Will you marry me?
   Chuck Schmitt, the 21-year-old assistant manager for the
Submarine Sandwich Shop in Dubuque, wanted to be a little different
in his proposal to Ms. Ryan, so he chose a radio spot broadcast
Tuesday night.
   Fifty seconds of the spot on KDFX-FM contained all the glories
about submarine sandwiches. In the final seconds, Schmitt said,
``By the way, Katie, I know you're listening, I love you really,
will you marry me?''
   Ms. Ryan had been told to listen, but the question was a
complete surprise.
   KDFX news director Casey Flint said Ms. Ryan called the station
about 30 seconds later, and was put on the air.
   She said yes, she was delighted to accept.
   The couple plans a Sept. 22 wedding.

   Charles R. Pilotte's curiosity was
piqued when he discovered a cache of pre-Prohibition era liquor
stashed behind a wall in his cellar.
   He had to know how the whiskey would go down.
   ``It's smooth, but the aftertaste _ when it hit it knocked me up
against a wall,'' he said.
   Pilotte found 19 bottles of liquor, including Haig &amp; Haig
Scotch, Gordon's gin, Old Crow bourbon, Chevalier brandy and Mount
Vernon whiskey, as he tore down a basement wall Jan. 7 in his
80-year-old home.
   In the wall, between a coal bin and a coal storage room, he
found a wooden fire break about 18 inches from the floor. He found
the liquor bottles wrapped in copies of the Boston Sunday Herald
and the Boston Evening Tribune, all dated from 1919, the year
before Prohibition took effect.
   Pilotte believes the bottles were left there by either Selby
Kidder or William B. Hunter, who lived in the house at that time.
   Pilotte is now trying to determine the value and age of his
discovery. He believes the Haig &amp; Haig might date back to the 1800s.
   Pilotte sampled the Mount Vernon whiskey because five bottles of
that brand were in the wall, and one of the bottle's appeared to
have leaked.
   The leak, Pilotte said, didn't effect the taste.

   Thirty-two wounded guerrillas
who took refuge in a downtown church more than two months ago are
demanding that the rightist government permit their evacuation
abroad.
   The leftist rebels, who made their demand Wednesday, say the
Geneva Accords oblige the government to permit evacuation. The
U.S.-backed government says the accords do not apply in this case.
   Troops have maintained a cordon around the Calvario Roman
Catholic Church since its occupation Nov. 9 by wounded rebels, most
of them amputees. The church, where the rebels sleep on the floor
and on pews, has been closed to worship.
   The International Red Cross has been allowed to deliver food to
the war wounded. But the rebels issued a communique Wednesday
saying they are suffering from lack of food and hygienic facilities.
   In October, the government permitted the evacuation to Cuba of
46 wounded rebels who had spent 43 days in Metropolitan Cathedral.
   The government of President Alfredo Cristiani is fighting a
10-year-old civil war with the rebels in which more than 70,000
people have been killed.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hector Higueras paid $9,000 to come
to the United States, but he ended up in Panama and now he can't
leave.
   Higueras is one of thousands of Cubans who arrived in Panama the
last four years as part of an underground ``human trafficking
ring'' allegedly involving Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and members
of Fidel Castro's government.
   ``Just as everyone knows there's drug trafficking in Colombia,
everybody here knows Noriega was trafficking Cubans,'' said
Higueras, 26, a computer programmer.
   ``Noriega profited financially, and Castro benefited by
provoking illegal migration to the United States'' and getting rid
of malcontents, he said.
   Since the U.S. invasion Dec. 20, Noriega's henchmen have either
been captured or are hiding, and the Cubans who arrived here
illegally are stuck.
   The refugees are asking for visas to the United States but don't
qualify under U.S. ``immediate family'' quotas, which means they
have to have parents or siblings living in the United States.
   Many of the Cubans are young, in their 20s, and have not known
anything but a Communist system. By Cuban standards, they are a
privileged lot, many having worked in the government bureaucracy as
secretaries, accountants and engineers.
   ``We are not Marielitos,'' Higueres said, referring to the 1980
Cuban boatlift off the Miami coast. ``We are not prisoners. There's
a lot of professionals.''
   He said the Cubans left their homeland because of the economic
situation there and events in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``If you live in a cave but see a ray of light far away, you
know there's something else there,'' said Higueras. ``But you don't
know how dark it's been until you get to the light.''
   Higueras, who helped form the new Cuban Refugees Commission,
says the smuggling ring shipped about 40,000 Cubans to Panama.
Although the exact number of Cubans in Panama now is not known, it
is much lower than 40,000, he says.
   The U.S. invasion brought the issue to light because Cuban
refugees say they did not feel free to speak up under Noriega's
military regime.
   The Cubans describe an intricate network that spanned South
America, including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil and the Mexican
border.
   A lawyer familiar with the cases said relatives of the Cubans
would have to give U.S. dollars, in cash, to an attorney in Panama.
   The Panamanian attorney would then contact officers in the
Panamanian Defense Forces to get permission for the Cuban to enter
the country. Sometimes Noriega himself would have to give his
approval.
   Then the Panamanians would bribe contacts in the Cuban
government, who would authorize an exit permit. The total cost
could go as high as $20,000 in a difficult case, said the attorney,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Everybody got a cut,'' said the attorney.
   The final cost varied depending on the passport, papers and
route provided by the ``palanganas,'' or wash basins, as the people
who traffic Cubans are called in Panama.
   The Cuban ambassador in Panama said he didn't know anything
about the smuggling ring.
   ``If it happened, it didn't have anything to do with the embassy
or the consulate,'' Ambassador Lazaro Mora said Wednesday.
   As the Cubans arrived in Panama City, they were led through a
``tunnel'' at the airport where immigration officials would take
their passports; for $20, they would get an identication card
specifying, ``Can't work.''
   ``I wanted to be a free person. But right away you felt like a
slave,'' said Jorge Reyes Barcelo, 23, whose family in Miami paid
$3,500 for him to leave Cuba.
   He said a ``palangana'' told him when arrived in Panama he had
to come up with another $3,500 to get to the United States.
   ``I saw very quickly what price you had to pay for freedom,''
said Reyes. ``I saw we were being moved like animals for a lot of
money. I thought until then everything was legal, because I didn't
know what my family had paid.''
   From the airport, the Cubans were driven to safe houses in
apartments and houses where up to 20 other Cubans were staying.
They said they were charged about $200 a month rent.
   Reyes said he was offered a trip to the Mexican border city of
Ciudad Juarez, where he would swim across to the United States.
   Instead, he left the safe house and joined other disillusioned
Cubans in Panama City.
   Higueras said he had received word he would be leaving for the
United States on Dec. 20, the day of the invasion.
   ``I didn't know how I would be leaving, but I was told to be
ready. I never heard from the man again. I lost all that money,''
said Higueras. ``But I felt happy. I knew it was a historic moment
that was ending something bad.''
   The new government of President Guillermo Endara is conducting a
census and is filing charges against Belgica del Castillo, the
director of immigration under Noriega, for allegedly running the
smuggling operation.
   Ms. Del Castillo sought asylum with Noriega at the Vatican
Embassy after the invasion. She surrendered last week.
   In Miami on Tuesday, a deputy U.S. attorney told a magistrate
the government has evidence of a Noriega-led ring that smuggled
illegal aliens into the United States. That raised the possibility
he could face charges in the United States in addition to the drug
trafficking charges.
   ``We believe we deserve refuge in the United States because of
the conditions we've had to live with and because Panama is
devastated and cannot absorb us,'' said Higueras.

   About 300 people, waving Armenian flags and
chanting ``Gorbachev must stop the killing,'' gathered near a
Soviet embassy Wednesday to protest that country's failure to end
fighting between Armenians and their Azerbaijani neighbors.
   ``We want the United States to put pressure on (Soviet President
Mikhail) Gorbachev to end this war,'' said Arby Coharian, a
spokeswoman for the Armenian National Committee which organized the
rally.
   ``This could be a thousand times worse than the earthquake,''
she said, referring to the 1988 disaster that killed thousands of
Armenians. ``This could lead to the death of the nation.''
   The crowd across the street from the Soviet Mission to the
United Nations kept up a continuous roar of chants like ``No more
genocide'' and ``Stop the killing in Azerbaijan.''
   Some held American flags, others waved the blue, red and orange
Armenian flag. About 15,000 people of Armenian heritage live in New
York City.
   Coharian said her organization was raising money to provide arms
so that Armenians can defend themselves. ``If no other country will
do it, we will do it,'' she said.
   In Moscow, the Kremlin told the thousands of soldiers it sent to
the Caucasus to shoot if need be to halt the fighting in the hills
around the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Thousands of Armenian refugees poured from the southern republic
of Azerbaijan, many beaten or chased from their homes by angry
mobs. Some blamed the attacks on Azerbaijanis who earlier fled
ethnic violence in Armenia.
   The death toll rose to 58, mostly Armenians, and the number of
injured to 169 in five days of civil warfare, said Interior
Ministry spokesman Dmitri Seleznyov.
   A predominantly Armenian enclave ruled by Azerbaijan since 1923,
Nagorno-Karabakh demanded in February 1988 to be annexed by
Armenia, renewing a decades-old feud between the two ethnic groups.
   ``We have had massacres a lot. This time we are protesting
before it happens,'' said demonstrator Lena Sarkissian. ``How much
can we wait and see? Until we are gone and finished?''
   Mrs. Sarkissian was born in 1918, three years after more than a
million Armenians were killed in a wave of persecution in Turkey.
   She said what is happening in the Soviet Union reminds her of
stories her parents told her about the 1915 massacres. ``It's very
sad,'' she said, breaking into tears.

   The United States should ``dare not ignore''
signals that gas emissions may be heating up the Earth, but it's
too early to set limits on carbon dioxide exhaust, the nation's
environmental chief said.
   Environmental Protection Agency administrator William K. Reilly
said Wednesday that although six of the 10 warmest years on record
occurred in the last decade, more study was needed on global
warming.
   Reilly said it would be three to five years before scientific
research ``gets anything conclusive or definitive on greenhouse
gases or climatic change. That should not, however, suggest it
should paralyze policy.''
   Environmentalists and some Senate Democrats have sharply
criticized the United States for refusing to commit to stabilizing
emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by the year 2000.
   In November, at an international conference on ways to slow or
halt dangerous climatic changes, many Europeans called for specific
curbs on ``greenhouse'' gases by the century's end.
   The United States agreed to a compromise declaration at the
conference that says global-warming pollutants should be stabilized
``as soon as possible.''
   Reilly criticized the countries calling for limits on gas
emissions.
   ``Most don't have a clue how they will achieve those cuts,'' he
said in a speech, which was part of an environmental lecture series
sponsored by The New York Botanical Garden.
   He said many countries haven't figured out the economic impact
of improving the fuel efficiency of cars and industrial plants to
meet a freeze in emissions. He said it would cost billions of
dollars.
   Reilly said, however, it was time to step up research on the
issue.
   ``Something important may be happening,'' he said. ``We dare not
ignore it.''
   He strongly supported the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, which is to meet in Washington next month.
   Scientists say the greenhouse effect could eventually turn
subtropical areas into deserts and coastal nations could face
massive flooding.
   Researchers have theorized that certain gases are trapping heat
within the atmosphere, causing temperatures to rise. They say that
carbon dioxide emissions, along with chlorofluorocarbons, methane
and nitrous oxides, may be the major causes.
   In his speech, Reilly encouraged conservation groups to make
more debt-for-nature swaps, deals in which developing countries
preserve ecologically sensitive areas for debt payments.
   He also said environmentalists now have a major opportunity to
protect nature because of heightened awareness of the world's
fragile environment.
   ``We need to seize the moment,'' he said. `` ... We need to do
everything we can personally do to preserve our Earth while there
is still time.''
   Reilly told a story in which Mark Twain was walking with a
friend in a hard rain.
   ``The friend asked, `Think it will stop?'
   ``Twain looked up and said, `Always has.'''
   He said nature, ``broadly defined, is a good deal tougher and
resilient than we give it credit for. ... Nature, I have no doubt,
will make it. It's human beings I'm worried about, whether we can
make it.''

   North Carolina's amnesty period for
residents to repay back taxes brought in millions of dollars and
$600,000 worth of bad checks.
   ``Can you believe that people will send in a bad check to pay
off something like this?'' asked Revenue Secretary Helen Powers.
``That's just adding insult to injury.''
   Ms. Powers told a legislative committee on Tuesday that those
who bounced checks were ineligible for amnesty and will be chased
down by the state.
   Not counting the bad checks, North Carolina received $38.6
million during the 90-day period during which tax evasion penalties
were waived, Ms. Powers said. That total ranked North Carolina
eighth among the 30 states that have conducted amnesty programs.
   There's more bad news ahead for the writers of bad checks: Tax
evasion penalties have increased.

   A former University of South Florida student
has been convicted of stealing two notebooks of his research data
from a laboratory at the school.
   Circuit Judge Richard Lazzara ordered Petr Taborsky to return
the books no later than sentencing Feb. 9, after a jury found him
guilty Tuesday of second-degree grand theft and theft of trade
secrets.
   Taborsky, 27, also was ordered to turn over to prosecutors any
copies made of the notebooks. He could face up to five years in
prison, but state guidelines indicate he might get probation.
   Taborsky was hired to work in USF's engineering laboratory on
research sponsored by Florida Progress Corp. in St. Petersburg. The
company, parent of Florida Power Corp., paid the school $68,000 for
the research it said Taborsky stole.
   Defense attorney Terrance Bostic argued that Taborsky was signed
to work on a biological project that failed, then continued the
work on his own. He said Taborsky maintains he owns the ideas.
   ``It's the story of a young, inquisitive student who returns to
the lab and begins to think back on what went wrong with the
biological portion and asks, What if?'''
   He shared his invention with his professor, Bostic argued, only
to have the corporation steal it.
   But Assistant State Attorney Judy Hoyer read from a series of
monthly Florida Progress reports that showed the company was
working all along on the experiments Taborsky said he conceived on
his own. She said if Taborsky were not convicted sponsored research
would cease to exist at universities.
   Frank Lucarelli, director of sponsored research USF, said it
would be a ``catastrophe'' if Taborsky was not found guilty because
it would destroy the trust that private corporations, which
sponsored $55 million of research last year, place in the school.

<HEAD>Kemp Cancels Reagan-Era Program Blamed for Billion-Dollar Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is killing a
mortgage insurance program that was part of the Reagan
administration's effort to trim the bureaucracy but is now blamed
for costing taxpayers nearly $1 billion.
   Kemp said Wednesday the Department of Housing and Urban
Development will phase out the co-insurance program and all private
lenders will have to get HUD approval before making new loans in
the meantime.
   Kemp, in a statement, said another HUD insurance program will
provide an alternative financing option. He said he would
restructure it by year's end to allow private lenders to process
and service those loans while making sure only HUD can approve the
necessary mortgage insurance.
   The decision to kill the co-insurance program, among the
programs investigated during last year's allegations of favoritism
and mismanagement at HUD in the 1980s, came four months after HUD
officials said it would be reformed and revived.
   Democrats in Congress have warned Kemp not to use agency
problems as excuses to drop programs, but a congressional aide said
he expected no battle over killing co-insurance.
   ``It was a seriously flawed program,'' said Donald Campbell,
staff director of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
subcommittee on housing. Democrats, however, likely would question
whether HUD has enough qualified staffers to oversee the program
Kemp promoted as an alternative, Campbell said.
   The co-insurance program, created in 1983, allowed private
lenders to issue mortgages for multifamily housing developments and
commit HUD to insuring roughly 80 percent of the loans. Audits by
HUD's inspector general have criticized co-insurance lenders for
approving bloated mortgages.
   Those high mortgages led to excessive rents, which in turn were
blamed for high vacancy rates that led to defaults _ leaving HUD
holding most of the bill.
   The General Accounting Office estimates that defaults and other
related HUD program losses have cost taxpayers at least $960
million.
   The most notorious case _ which Kemp cited in announcing the
decision _ was the HUD-backed loan for Colonial House apartments in
Houston.
   The development was co-insured for $47.2 million. HUD was forced
to take over Colonial House after default and recovered just $8.9
million when it auctioned the property.
   In his statement Wednesday, Kemp said extensive reviews by HUD
staff and outside auditors convinced him to kill the program.
   ``Our review of co-insurance, and its mounting losses, has shown
that it cannot be managed or overseen in a way that will serve the
interests of the public at large or the needs of families for
affordable housing,'' Kemp said.
   ``It is clear that co-insurance has been a bad deal for the
American taxpayer,'' he said.
   Kemp said HUD's full insurance program, under which the
government itself issues the mortgage insurance and is 100 percent
liable in the event of default, would help pick up the slack for
homebuyers. Underwriting the mortgage insurance directly would give
HUD greater oversight of loans.
   But Campbell, the Senate aide, said, ``The problem here is that
they are going back to full insurance and there is no evidence that
they have the staff to handle the demand.'' He said co-insurance
was created because of HUD staff reductions and the Bush
administration resisted attempts by Democrats to boost staffing
levels this year.
   Documents released by HUD and testimony at congressional
hearings showed that one company, DRG Funding Corp., had nearly
$600 million of the loans of the $960 million in HUD losses.
   DRG was placed on probation during the Reagan administration by
then-Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and required to submit
all of its proposed co-insurance loans to HUD for approval.
   But Pierce lifted the restrictions after being lobbied by Carla
Hills, a former HUD secretary who was then in private law practice
and now serves as the Bush administration's trade representative.

<HEAD>US Diplomats Worried About Impact of Panama Incidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry State Department officials say U.S.
diplomats overseas could be the target of reprisals following a
series of incidents between U.S. forces in Panama and foreign
envoys there.
   ``We cannot conduct diplomacy on the basis of 25-watt
thinking,'' said one administration official, accusing the U.S.
military of failing to take into account the potential diplomatic
consequences of its actions.
   The incidents ``put in jeopardy American diplomatic missions all
over the world,'' said Perry Shankle, a former president of the
American Foreign Service Association, the union of career
diplomats. He was the only one of several officials interviewed who
was willing to be quoted by name.
   Fearful of the diplomatic fallout as a result of incidents at
the embassies in Panama of the Vatican, Cuba, Peru and Nicaragua,
the association has expressed its concern in a private letter to
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The United States is considered particularly vulnerable to
reprisals against its diplomats because it often pursues unpopular
policies internationally and also has more envoys stationed
overseas than any other country.
   The State Department insists the United States subscribes fully
to rules governing treatment of diplomats spelled out in the Vienna
Convention. On the other hand, it acknowledges that an ``unusual
situation'' has prevailed in Panama.
   A U.S. official, worried about the precedent set in Panama,
said, ``We diplomats have to rely on good faith of foreign
governments to live up to their commitments to protect us.''
   One foreign service officer expressed particular outrage over
the statement by President Bush following the Dec. 29 penetration
of the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama by U.S. forces searching for
weapons.
   Bush acknowledged that a mistake had been made because the U.S.
troops thought the envoy lived elsewhere, but the president sharply
criticized the diplomat for ``having automatic weapons up to his
eyeballs in his house.''
   The U.S. official said Nicaragua is not alone in having weapons
caches stored at its diplomatic sites.
   If a hostile group entered U.S. facilities in some foreign
countries, ``don't you think they would find RPG's
(rocket-propelled grenades)?'' the official asked. ``You don't
think we have TOW (anti-tank) missiles in some compounds?''
   Use of loud music outside the Vatican Embassy, where Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega sought refuge on Dec. 24, drew angry complaints of
``amateurism'' from some State Department officials and expressions
of irritation from the Vatican.
   A few days after the invasion, Cuban officials charged the U.S.
forces were preventing diplomats from entering or leaving their
embassy as part of the effort to bar Noriega from seeking refuge
there. U.S. officials denied the Cuban allegations.
   In an effort to track down Panamanians who served Noriega,
American troops have been checking cars entering and leaving the
Cuban mission even though some experts contend such vehicles
apparently are exempt from such activity under international law.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler has said the
Cuban ambassador's car ``has very dark, tinted windows which
require troops guarding the mission to open the doors to identify
the passengers.''
   But a State Department official said the action by the troops
``exposes every American ambassador to the possibility of an armed
blockade. He would have to agree to be searched. This is appalling.
This is the most appalling thing I've ever seen.''
   The official listed about seven adversary countries which he
said may use the Panama precedents as an excuse to harass U.S.
diplomats as a means of punishing the United States.
   At a time of embittered anti-American feelings in 1979, there
were attacks on three U.S. embassies in the Middle East in less
than a month, and each is believed to have had official
encouragement or acquiescence. The attack on the U.S. embassy in
Tehran produced the Iran hostage crisis, which dragged on for 444
days.
   Some Panamanians being sought by U.S. forces are wanted in the
United States on drug trafficking charges, Ms. Tutwiler said. She
added that the police functions being carried out by the U.S.
troops at various embassies in Panama are being transferred quickly
to Panamanian security forces.

<HEAD>Federal Approval of Generics Fell Sharply After Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is approving
far fewer generic drugs for sale to consumers as a result of the
fraud and bribery scandal that enveloped the agency last year.
   The troubles at the FDA's generic drug division never shut off
the pipeline entirely, but the agency said it approved fewer than
half the generic drugs in 1989 than it had the year before.
   The slowdown, said Jay Molishever of the Generic Pharmaceutical
Industry Association, has caused a ``clogging of the pipeline''
that is hurting consumers and generic drug companies alike.
   ``It hurts the consumer because the drugs aren't getting to
them, and it hurts the innocent generic firms because the
opportunity to market these drugs is delayed by the necessary
diversion of manpower to correct the problem created by a few,''
Molishever said in an interview Wednesday.
   The FDA said it approved 265 generic drugs in 1989, compared
with 684 the previous year.
   Hemant K. Shah of HKS &amp; Co., a pharmaceutical analyst based in
Warren, N.J., said there has been little impact from the approval
slowdown because no patents for widely prescribed drugs expired
last year and none will for the next six months.
   Only when a patent expires on a brand-name drug can a generic
alternative be approved. Such approvals are sometimes granted
within days of a patent expiration.
   ``Even if we had more generic approvals in 1989 there wouldn't
have been an impact in terms of more generic use or less generic
use because almost every important product that is off patent is
facing generic competition,'' Shah said.
   ``In hindsight, this investigation came at the right time for
the generic drug industry because ... it came at a time when more
approvals wouldn't have meant anything to the industry,'' he said.
   Molishever said ``the low point has been reached'' in the
approval process and ``the pipeline is starting to work again,''
but couldn't foresee when the regulatory process would be back to
normal speed.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the system won't be back to full
steam until a permanent director and other top officials are chosen
and ``the office is in place and running.''
   Though he didn't know when that would be, he predicted generic
drug approvals for this year will be off only slightly from 1988
figures.
   The scandal that became public last spring led to the bribery
convictions of three generic drug company executives and
bribe-taking convictions of three FDA employees, including Charles
Chang, former branch chief in the generic drug division.
   The investigation also uncovered evidence that some drug
companies cheated on FDA safety tests and prompted recalls of
dozens of generic drugs, including the lower-priced clones of some
popular drugs.
   One of the most widely prescribed drugs affected was Dyazide, a
high blood pressure medication made by SmithKline Beecham.
   Last summer, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield
Gardens, N.Y., withdrew its version of Dyazide from the market
after admitting company employees substituted samples of the
brand-name drug for Vitarine's product in tests required for FDA
approval.
   The only other generic version of the drug on the market is made
by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. of Copiague, N.Y. The FDA is
trying to remove it because of allegations Bolar misrepresented
data to the agency.

   Nine stowaways from the Dominican Republic
and another from Panama were being held aboard a freighter
Wednesday following a failed attempt to enter the United States,
officials said.
   Eight of the Dominicans were discovered Sunday after the
Tramarco Trader docked in Gulfport, Miss., and two who got off the
ship were caught later that day, said Dave Mandel, head agent of
the Border Patrol's office there.
   The ship left that port on the central Gulf Coast, reaching
Mobile on Wednesday.
   The Dominicans were scheduled to fly to their Caribbean island
home Thursday, but the Panamanian was to remain aboard because of
governmental problems in Panama, said Jeff Mynatt, operations
manager for Strachan Shipping Co.
   The company must have permission from the Panamanian Consulate
to remove him from the ship, Mynatt said.
   ``We don't really know why he got on board,'' he said. ``He said
he was just trying to get out of Panama.''
   The United States invaded Panama, ousting dictator Manuel
Noriega, and installing a new government.
   Mandel said the stowaways were economic refugees ``looking for a
good place to live and work.''

<HEAD>New Technique Superior in Blocking Rejection of Transplants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have prevented the rejection of
transplanted organs by altering the immune system so that the
organs don't appear to be foreign, according to a new study.
   The technique has been used only in laboratory animals so far,
but it promises to be a vast improvement over current methods of
preventing organ rejection in humans, says one of the study's
participants, Dr. C. Garrison Fathman of Stanford University in
California.
   The success of heart, kidney and liver transplants is limited by
the ability of researchers to suppress the body's defenses _ so
they don't reject the organ _ while leaving enough of those
defenses intact to prevent infections and cancer.
   ``It's trading one disease for another,'' Fathman said Wednesday
at the American Heart Association's annual science writers' forum.
   A heart transplant, for example, cures heart disease, but the
immune system suppression leads to infections that often require
hospitalization, Fathman said. Sometimes the organ is rejected
despite efforts to suppress the immune system.
   In the new technique, treatment is given before the transplant,
rather than after.
   A specially developed antibody is used to wipe out the white
blood cells called helper T cells. These are the master control
cells of the immune system. (They are also the cells attacked by
the AIDS virus.)
   The organ transplant surgery is then performed. In the ensuing
weeks and months, the helper T cells return, but in the course of
their return they are ``educated'' not to destroy any of the body's
own tissue.
   In the course of that ``education,'' the cells learn to
recognize the newly transplanted organ as the body's own tissue,
not as foreign tissue.
   Otherwise the immune system is perfectly normal and can protect
against infections as well as it could before the transplant. The
immune system is not suppressed.
   One of the technique's peculiar advantages is that even though
the new cells are changed to recognize the transplanted organ as
the body's own, they retain the ability to protect against
infections that they have already fought off.
   The technique would not, for example, destroy the lifelong
immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or chicken pox,
Fathman said.
   He and his Stanford colleagues have done heart transplants on 25
rats and only two have rejected the transplants, he said.
   Research is under way to find human versions of the antibodies
so that trials of the technique can begin in humans, Fathman said.
   So far, none of the antibodies tested has shown the same effects
on human cells, but the researchers are confident that effective
human antibodies will be found, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is being roasted by
Iowa members of Congress over its handling of a $3.7 million
program that is supposed to curb outbreaks of pseudorabies in swine.
   Also called PRV, Ajuesky's disease and mad itch, the virus can
be deadly to swine _ especially newborn pigs _ and can be
transmitted to most other warmblooded animals, except humans and
horses.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said Wednesday that too much of the
money meant for eradicating pseudorabies appears lost in ``a black
hole'' of administrative costs.
   ``It's my intention to work with the inspector general and the
GAO (General Accounting Office) to get some accounting breakouts,''
Harkin said at a hearing on where money for the 2-year-old program
are going.
   ``Where's the black hole?'' he asked.
   More than 20 percent of Iowa swine herds are infected with
pseudorabies and nearly 47 percent of the nation's infected herds
are located in Iowa, said Harkin.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, who says he represents the leading
pork-producing district in the nation, also has blasted USDA for
spending so much on paperwork instead of testing, vaccination and
other efforts directly related to getting rid of the virus.
   ``This vital federal program dedicated to eradicating deadly
swine disease has been rendered virtually useless by bureaucratic
red tape,'' said Tauke in a press release Monday.
   Two USDA officials admitted at the hearing that a greater
percentage of the appropriated funds was going to administration
than Congress intended.
   But they defended the use as necessary and said there still was
enough money to make progress in the eradication program.
   The 10-year federal effort to rid the nation's swine population
of pseudorabies began last January with $3.1 million for 1989. The
amount was increased for fiscal 1990. The program also calls for
state and pork industry contributions.
   Harkin and Tauke are miffed because Iowa is getting only $6,000
more this year, despite the $600,000 overall increase in federal
funds. Some states are actually being cut back.
   Lonnie King, deputy administrator at USDA's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said that in 1989 other agency programs
helped support the administrative costs of running the pseudorabies
program.
   ``Because pseudorabies will pay its fair share of expenses and
because of the consolidation of purchases to save money, some state
allocations will be reduced,'' said King ``We are confident that
the funds allocated to the states are adequate to further the
progress of the national eradication program.''
   But Harkin wasn't satisfied.
   ``This confirms everyone's worst fears about government,'' he
said.
   Pseudorabies develops from a herpes virus that is completely
different from rabies. However, its name was derived because of the
mouth frothing, teeth grinding and other signs that also are
characteristic of rabies.
   Even when swine recover from the disease, they continue to be
carriers of the virus, according to USDA animal health authorities.

   The Soviet Union is buying more U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices under a long-term grain agreement, says the
Agriculture Department.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday an additional 525,000
metric tons of wheat was sold by four private companies. The
exporters will receive subsidies under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said 511,650 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation of 2 million tons announced on Dec.
19. Only wheat has been approved for sale to the Soviets under the
price subsidy program.
   The seventh year of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement began on
Oct. 1. With the latest sales, the Soviet Union has bought about
2.3 million tons of wheat for 1989-90 delivery and more than 11
million tons of corn, plus some soybeans and soybean meal. All of
the wheat was sold under EEP arrangements.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced the next round of negotiations
with the Soviets on a new agreement will be in Vienna on March
21-22. The current pact will expire on Dec. 31.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement, the Soviet Union
bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3 million
tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain sorghums. All
but about 700,000 tons of the wheat was bought under EEP.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 525,000 tons are equal to 19.3 million bushels worth
around $73 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $18.73 per
ton, or about 51 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by J. Aron &amp; Co.,
250,000 tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 150,000; Harvest States
Cooperatives, 100,000; and Cargill Inc., 25,000.

   Unseasonably high temperatures and dry soil
conditions in much of nation are adding to worries about the 1990
winter wheat crop, says the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility.
   The facility, an operation of the Commerce and Agriculture
departments, reported Wednesday on crop and weather conditions for
the week of Jan. 8-14.
   ``Warmer-than-normal temperatures during the week in most winter
wheat states created concerns of wheat breaking dormancy too early,
making (the crop) vulnerable to a freeze,'' the report said.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and normally is dormant
during midwinter cold before starting to grow again when warmer
weather returns. The crop is harvested in the summer.

``Hitlerian'' liar Wednesday, and declared he would seek and win
re-election to the U.S. Senate in 1992.
   The Democratic whip, facing the worst political crisis of his 21
years in the U.S. Senate, refused again in a statewide series of
news conferences to take any more than the most limited amount of
responsibility for the billions lost by taxpayers and savers in the
Lincoln collapse.
   He added that he is still not certain it was wise for the
government to seize Lincoln,'' and refused to criticize Charles
Keating, the Phoenix millionaire who was chief executive officer of
Lincoln Savings, saying the courts will pass judgment on whether
Keating did anything wrong.
   But Cranston lashed out angrily at Edwin Gray, the former
chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and Cranston's
principal accuser.
   Cranston used the words ``lie'' or ``lies'' 20 times in prepared
remarks to describe Gray's charges, and accused Gray of being a
``self-incriminating liar'' and practicioner of ``the `Hitlerian'
technique of the big lie.''
   Gray was vacationing in Europe and could not be reached for
comment.
   Cranston said he was not aware that Gray would be unavailable to
respond to his charges when he scheduled his series of news
conferences in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento to attack
him.
   ``I come before you bloodied but unbowed,'' Cranston told a
crowd of reporters. ``I assure you I've only now begun to fight,''
he added, scoffing over ``ghouls'' he said want to succeed him in
1992.
   ``I have news for Mr. Gray and his right-wing friends. I shall
run for re-election in 1992 and I will win,'' the Democrat said in
the concluding line of a six-page statement attacking Gray.
   In his three-city media blitz, Cranston denied repeatedly that
he did anything improper in the Lincoln scandal, which could end up
costing $2 billion in a tax-funded bailout, plus losses of $200
million for 23,000 Lincoln investors.
   Cranston acknowledged that by taking $850,000 in contributions
from Keating, then intervening with regulators on Keating's behalf
that he created ``the appearance of impropriety and did myself
political damage, but I repeat there was no impropriety.''
   Three separate polls in recent weeks have reported Cranston's
popularity falling to its lowest level in his long Senate tenure.
   The senator accused Gray of being the ``key source'' of
accusations that Cranston and other senators met with Gray in April
1987 to delay action against Lincoln.
   Questioned by reporters, Cranston said it wasn't unusual that
he, fellow senators Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, John McCain of
Arizona and John Glenn of Ohio, met with Gray. A second meeting, a
few days later with San Francisco bank examiners, included Sen. Don
Riegle of Michigan.
   The meetings are the subject of a Senate Ethics Committee
inquiry.
   ``Each senator had his own reason for going to that meeting; I
went solely to get a speedier decision on the audit, one way or the
other.... I (have) said I made a political mistake.... I do not
think it was a moral or ethical mistake.''

<HEAD>'Tis the Season to Save the Wetlands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mistletoe and holly no longer deck the halls,
and everyone has stopped singing carols, but the interest in
Christmas trees here is almost as high as it was a month ago.
   The trees are being hauled into the marshes and swamps in a
battle to slow erosion of the region's wetlands, which are
disappearing at the rate of about 50 square miles a year.
   ``Everybody wants to take part. It's great. Instead of just
throwing out your Christmas tree, you can send it to save a
marsh,'' said Bob Thomas of the Louisiana Nature and Science Center.
   Environmentalists hope the trees will collect sediment and form
barriers to waves, protecting the shoreline. The project, in its
third year, also has a side benefit: It saves space in dumps.
   The program was started by John Day of the Coastal Ecology
Institute of Louisiana State University.
   Day and some graduate students built a line of fences across an
eroded marsh and filled it with tree limbs and native bamboo. The
project, which had to be done by hand, was impractical, Thomas said.
   ``It was not something that was going to catch on. It had to be
done in January and February when the vegetation had died down. It
was cold and you'd sink into the water and ooze up to your waist,''
he said.
   Day believed Christmas trees would do the job, but he didn't
think he could get enough of them. The Nature and Science Center
put out the word, however, and the trees came pouring in.
   There was so much interest, the project was expanded this year.
Instead of making people haul their shedding trees to the Nature
Center, curbside pickups were organized.
   ``We get more than we can use,'' Thomas said. ``We only have
funding to put in 12,000 trees and a lot of people are disappointed
when their tree just gets left for the trash.''
   Contractors sank posts into the marsh, and the trees, some still
twinkling with strands of tinsel, are laid between the posts. A
fence is placed on top of the trees, said Gretchen Binet, the St.
Charles Parish official who oversees the swamp work.
   ``It will affect 6,000 acres of marsh when it's done. We can see
results already,'' Binet said. ``It's damping the wave action,
protecting the shoreline. You can see the sediment around the
fences already. Instead of washing away it's growing there.''
   The state spent $35,800 to stack the trees into the fences that
were set up last year. Other costs are minimal, said William
Conner, an assistant at the Coastal Ecology Institute.
   Landfill owners have helped collect the trees, and duck hunters
help place the trees in the swamps, Conner said.
   Preliminary studies are being compiled, he said. So far, they
think the trees help, but they're still unsure how much.
   ``You can see the sediment around the fences. Mud flats are
being created. It looks very hopeful. You can see the buildup, but
we don't know how fast it will work,'' Conner said.
   He hopes that sediment will cover the trees completely before
they decompose, making a long-term barrier.
   ``The areas we're working in were once marsh, but are now open
water,'' Conner said. ``We hope to see grass take root and a marsh
established again. It could be one of the best presents ever left
by a Christmas tree if it works.''

<HEAD>Regulators Selling Bonds for $5 Billion for Thrift Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators are raising another $5 billion for
President Bush's S&amp;L bailout and putting another 43 institutions up
for sale.
   The Resolution Funding Corp. (Refcorp) said Wednesday it will
raise the $5 billion next Tuesday by selling 40-year bonds, a
maturity 10 years longer than any current government issue.
   Meanwhile, the Resolution Trust Corp. (RTC) said the S&amp;Ls for
sale are located in 16 states and have assets totaling $5.2 billion.
   Some securities analysts have been skeptical about whether
Refcorp bonds will appeal to investors. The Treasury last sold
40-year bonds in 1955.
   But the Treasury Department official in charge of debt sales
said the government believes it can save money on the interest rate
paid on the bonds, compared with 30-year debt. That's because of
the lack of competition from comparable bond issues.
   ``Experts in the market are telling us we can sell 40-year paper
cheaper than we can sell 30-year,'' said Michael Basham, deputy
assistant secretary for federal finance. ``Obviously we'll find out
pretty soon.''
   The longer maturity also benefits the industry-owned Federal
Home Loan Bank system, which through a complex mechanism is
providing the money to pay off the principal of the bonds.
   The bank system must put up roughly $230 million to
collateralize $5 billion borrowed for 40 years, versus $500 million
to back that amount for 30 years.
   However, the bank system could end up paying a greater share of
interest costs because the money is being borrowed for 10 years
longer. Early on, the interest on the Refcorp bonds is being paid
primarily by the Treasury, but later the industry will assume a
greater share.
   All told, after the latest bond sale, the government will have
borrowed $29.5 billion for S&amp;L rescues, with $20.5 billion left to
borrow through Sept. 30, 1991, bringing the total to $50 billion.
   Regulators, in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee,
also said they need to borrow another $40 billion to $100 billion
in short term ``working capital,'' which will be repaid by selling
assets from failed S&amp;Ls.
   The letter, released Wednesday, said regulators hoped to come up
with a plan for the additional borrowing by mid-February. The
administration and Democrats in Congress have been struggling over
whether the additional borrowing should be counted toward the
budget deficit.
   The letter outlined three ways of raising the money, one
on-budget and two outside the budget. Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
a member of the Banking and Budget committees, said the two
off-budget plans were ``unrealistic.'' He warned the on-budget plan
could be structured to actually make it easier to meet Gramm-Rudman
deficit reduction targets.
   ``It is designed to manipulate the crisis in the thrift industry
to mask the size of the deficit and cover up a glaring inability to
achieve real reduction,'' Schumer said in a statement.
   Meanwhile, the RTC said the latest batch of S&amp;Ls offered for
sale brings the total available to 70 institutions out of 293 in
its portfolio. Each of the 43 has assets of less than $300 million.
The RTC has already sold or closed 40 institutions.
   Institutions in the latest offering are located in Florida,
Connecticut, Virginia, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama,
Arkansas, Kansas, Illinois, Michigan, Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico,
California and Colorado.
   In another development, the Office of Thrift Supervision said
Southmark Corp., the parent company of San Jacinto Savings
Association, Bellaire, Texas, agreed to inject $210 million in
capital into the S&amp;L.
   San Jacinto is among a number of S&amp;Ls, including Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., and Silverado Banking,
Savings and Loan Association, of Denver, that are under
investigation for disguising losses by trading junk bonds to each
other at inflated prices.

   A senior Justice Department official, blamed
by Democratic congressional aides for many of Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's troubles on Capitol Hill, is resigning.
   Assistant Attorney General Carol Crawford says she doesn't enjoy
serving as the Justice Department's representative on Capitol Hill
and considers herself ill-suited for the job.
   ``There is no eloquent way of saying this. This is not the right
job for me,'' Ms. Crawford said Wednesday night. ``The functions of
this position are not really funjoy or I am
particularly well-suited for.''
   Ms. Crawford, the wife of management consultant and Republican
donor Ron Crawford, said she ictions that I ennformed Thornburgh last week
of her
decision to resign.
   Although she has been criticized within the department and on
Capitol Hill for an antagonistic style, Ms. Crawford said her
departure was her own idea.
   Ms. Crawford said she had no immediate plans, adding, ``Right
now I am going to take some time off.''
   She also expressed surprise at criticism of her performance.
   ``I can't think of anybody I've had unpleasant relations with,''
she said. Any adversave never been publicly disclosed.

<HEAD>Court Says Police Can't Make Random Drug Searches on Buses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says the war on drugs ``seems
to have gone too far'' with random searches of young people riding
interstate buses.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled Wednesday that the
searches, a key part of the District of Columbia police battle to
stop drugs from coming into the city, violate basic constitutional
rights to privacy.
   Sporkin threw out as evidence 20 grams of cocaine and 50 packets
of heroin police said they seized from a suspect, Dennis S. Lewis,
who was arrested in Washington last October on a bus from New York.
   ``The random, indiscriminate stopping and questioning of
individuals on interstate buses seems to have gone too far,''
Sporkin wrote. ``In this `anything goes' war on drugs, random
knocks on doors of our citizens' seeking `consent' to search for
illegal drugs cannot be far away. This is not America.''
   Sporkin said he was ``deeply troubled'' by ruling so that the
case against Lewis might allow him to escape prosecution.
   But he wrote, ``We cannot become so obsessed with this drug
scourge to permit it to dismember the Constitution.''
   Lewis was on a bus at Washington's Union Station when he
consented to a patdown search by a plainclothes detective, who
found a packet of cocaine stuffed in one of Lewis' socks. Marijuana
was found in Lewis' jacket pocket and heroin was found in a bag on
the floor at Lewis' seat on the bus.
   The detective testified at a hearing that he had no particular
reason for questioning Lewis and that ``sometimes I'll just walk up
to anyone who may be on the bus and ask to talk to them.''
   The judge said in his ruling, ``Even in our drug-infested
society it is clear that our legal system demands the existence of
some cause before a police officer will approach a citizen to
determine whether that individual may be engaged in some illicit
activity.''

   Convicted killer Gerald Smith was executed by
lethal injection early Thursday, becoming the the 121st nationwide
since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restore the death
penalty in 1976.
   Smith, 31, of St. Louis, who had asked that his death sentence
be carried out, was pronounced dead at 12:09 by a physician, said
Dick Moore, director of the state Department of Corrections.
   Smith had no last words and refused an opportunity to write a
last statement, prison spokesman Dale Riley said.
   Among the witnesses in the death chamber: Smith's wife, Lynn;
his court-appointed attorney, C. John Pleban; and an unidentified
female acquaintance.
   Smith was given separate lethal doses of sodium pentathol,
pavulon and potassium chloride. The process took about five
minutes, and Smith was unconscious within minutes, Riley said.
   After the injection, Smith looked at his wife, who mouthed ``I
love you.'' He appeared to respond, but then he closed his eyes.
   Smith had asked for a sedative about 8:30 p.m. and fell asleep
about 10:30 p.m., Riley said. Prison officials awakened Smith at 11
p.m. to begin procedures for the execution.
   Death-penalty opponents made a last-ditch effort to save Smith's
life by filing a motion Wednesday afternoon with the U.S. Supreme
Court, but the court voted 7-2 to reject the appeal by the Missouri
Capital Punishment Resource Center in Kansas City.
   Another group asked Gov. John Ashcroft for a reprieve to block
the execution, but Ashcroft declined, his spokesman said.
   It was Missouri's second execution since 1965.
   Smith met Wednesday evening with his court-appointed attorney,
C. John Pleban, said prison spokesman Dale Riley.
   ``Whether he had known that this appeal was going to be made, I
don't know,'' Riley said of Pleban, who was unavailable for
comment. Smith was told the appeal had been rejected.
   Smith, said as he ate breakfast in an isolation cell Wednesday
that he was ready for the execution, Riley said.
   Earlier, Pleban conceded that few, if any, legal angles remained
to spare his client, who has wavered in the past on his claim that
he wanted to die.
   Smith's wife, Lynn, and an unidentified woman spent several
hours visiting him in his cell, Riley said.
   Smith was sentenced to be executed for the beating death of
Karen Roberts in St. Louis. Another death sentence was imposed for
the slaying in 1985 of a fellow death-row inmate.
   The Missouri Coalition Against the Death Penalty petitioned
Ashcroft to grant Smith a reprieve, but the governor's spokesman,
Bob Ferguson, said his boss ``will not interfere with the judicial
process.''
   Smith had been sentenced to die a week ago, but Pleban got a
stay from Associate Justice Harry Blackmun until the U.S. Supreme
Court could review more arguments.
   The nation's highest court lifted the stay by a 6-3 vote Tuesday
and the Missouri Supreme Court moved quickly to set the new
execution date.
   Smith said in a letter to a newspaper that he chased and killed
Miss Roberts because she gave him a venereal disease.
   ``I wanted her to feel some pain so I beat her little lousy head
in. If she were living now I would do it all over to her again.''
   He signed the letter: ``Gerald Smith, the cold blooded killer.''

<HEAD>Eight Dead In Three-Day Crime Wave</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with Navy saying man had been
sought in sailors' slayings, had gun taken in pawnshop shooting;
picks up 13th graf, `No money ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man found dead Wednesday at a motel had been
sought in the slayings of two fellow sailors at a submarine base
and had a gun stolen from a pawnshop where a clerk was killed, the
Navy said.
   The two sailors and the clerk were victims in a deadly three-day
crime wave. Five other people died in three other apparently
unrelated shootings.
   The rash of killings left investigators searching for motives
and for an explanation to the sudden jump in Seattle-area homicides.
   ``I can't remember ever having this many in a three-day
period,'' said Cecil Ray, a police spokesman for King County, which
includes Seattle. The county had only one slaying this year before
the latest spree.
   Navy officials said the sailors were found shot to death Tuesday
in the bachelor enlisted quarters at Naval Submarine Base, Bangor,
which is about 25 miles west of Seattle on the Hood Canal.
   The officials said little about the killings, which occurred at
the base for the Navy's West Coast fleet of Trident submarines.
   The shooting at the Bremerton pawnshop about 10 miles from the
naval base occurred about a half hour after the sailors' bodies
were found.
   The Navy said in a statement late Wednesday that the sailor
found dead in a motel room 180 miles south in Vancouver, Wash.,
apparently died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
   The man had been sought in the slayings, and was found with the
9mm pistol stolen from the pawnshop, the Havy said. Except for
those used by security guards, guns are banned on the base.
   The sailor's name was withheld pending notification of
relatives, said Navy spokesman Gene Romano.
   The slain sailors were identified as David Allen Parker, 21, of
San Diego, and Scott Anthony Seely, 18, of North Ridgeville, Ohio,
west of Cleveland.
   Parker was a radioman and Seely a fireman on the submarine USS
Michigan.
   Romano had earlier said the Navy killings were not connected to
the pawnshop shooting in which clerk Julie Michaels, 32, was killed
and her 35-year-old brother critically wounded.
   No money was taken and the only thing believed missing was a
handgun, said Bremerton Police Capt. Dennis Plumb, who said police
have few leads and no suspects.
   The pawnshop shootings brought to eight the number of deaths in
shootings in the area during the past three days.
   On Monday, two Seattle lawyers were found shot to death in a
house they were fixing up just south of the city.
   Capt. T. Michael Nault, King County police major crimes
commander, said the lawyers were not killed at random and that at
least one of the victims might have known the assailant or
assailants.
   The county medical examiner's office said the two, Eric A.
Hoyer, 34, and Steven M. Dorobis, about 36, were killed sometime
Sunday.
   ``There's no obvious motive. We're trying to figure out why and
who,'' said Ray, the King County police spokesman.
   A Seattle homeowner killed a man and wounded another in a
shootout with intruders who broke into his home Sunday, police
said. The homeowner was wounded in the hand.
   Two brothers were killed, a third brother was injured and a
fourth man held for investigation of homicide and assault in a
shooting spree Sunday outside an apartment complex in Des Moines,
south of Seattle.
   Police said they believe the shootings may have been the work of
a jealous boyfriend.

<TEXT>
   As protests gathered strength last fall, East
Germany's longtime orthodox leader Erich Honecker ``lost touch with
reality,'' according to the man who succeeded him as Communist
leader only to be ousted later.
   Egon Krenz, the successor, and former Politburo member Guenter
Schabowski on Wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality
that engulfed the hard-liners toward the end.
   ``There was the notion in the former party leadership that
everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by
the Communist youth group was an action organized by enemy
forces,'' Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin.
   The testimony was broadcast on East German television.
   Schabowski said Honecker had personally ordered police attacks
against demonstrators in early October, working closely with his
then-secret police chief, Erich Mielke.
   ``Honecker took things into his own hands,'' Schabowski said.
``All decisions and orders that led to the police actions against
demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through
Honecker and Mielke.''
   Like Krenz, Schabowski denied any personal responsibility for
the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital.
   The attempts at suppression were engineered by Honecker and
Mielke, bypassing the other 19 members of the ruling Politburo,
Krenz insisted.
   ``Then-general secretary Erich Honecker and the internal
security chief Erich Mielke immediately after each session of the
Politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of
the German Democratic Republic,'' Krenz said.
   Honecker and Mielke are now targeted for an indictment for high
treason.
   The East Berlin city government commission is probing possible
criminal charges stemming from police brutality during the October
attacks in the capital.
   Club-swinging riot police brutally beat demonstrators on Oct. 7
and 8, when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was in town to
commemorate the country's 40th anniversary. The uprising was a
turning point that speeded Honecker's downfall 10 days later.
   Krenz, who had responsibility for many internal security
functions before Honecker's ouster, criticized the use of force
during his testimony Wednesday.
   ``The excessive action of law enforcement authorities was
neither politically nor morally justifiable,'' he told the panel,
speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit.
   Krenz, who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding Honecker on
Oct. 18, insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot
demonstrators. Numerous news media accounts have said Honecker
either planned or issued such orders.
   Krenz said he accepted ``joint responsibility for misjudging
dissident citizens and dissident groups for years.''
   ``From today's viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was
no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments
then taking place in society,'' said Krenz, an influential
Politburo member even before Honecker's fall.
   Krenz added that he and other then-members of the Politburo
failed to realize that the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches
were ``not working against but rather for the German Democratic
Republic.''
   ``Honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic
perspectives,'' Krenz said of his one-time patron, who for years
treated him like a son.
   Honecker has been in ill health following gallbladder surgery
last summer. He was recently operated on for a malignant kidney
tumor.
   Krenz's current occupation has not been publicized, following
his fall as party chief on Dec. 3.

<HEAD>Study: Maybe Oat Bran Doesn't Lower Cholesterol After All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ballyhooed powers of oat bran are challenged
by a study today concluding this faddish food fails to lower
cholesterol after all.
   The idea that oat bran lowers the level of dangerous cholesterol
in the blood has been widely accepted in recent years. Some health
experts have recommended starting the day with a bowl of oatmeal,
and oat bran has become a common ingredient in muffins, cookies,
bagels, even doughnuts and potato chips.
   The new study found that people's cholesterol levels indeed go
down when they eat lots of oat bran, but it's only because they
also eat less saturated fat and cholesterol than usual.
   ``There really isn't any cholesterol-lowering property in oat
bran,'' said Dr. Frank M. Sacks, a co-author of the study.
   Some researchers were skeptical of the findings.
   ``There is a clear cholesterol-lowering effect when you use
oatmeal or oat bran,'' said Fred Shinnick, a research scientist at
Quaker Oats Co., which stresses oat bran's benefits in its cereal
ads. ``We don't think one small study disproves the weight of the
evidence that has been published over the past 25 years.''
   Oat bran is promoted as a health food largely because it is rich
in soluble fiber. Several studies have suggested that this kind of
fiber somehow removes cholesterol from the body.
   High amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol in the diet can
raise blood cholesterol levels, leading to heart disease. But when
people eat lots of grain products, they're too full to eat their
usual amounts of fatty food, according to the new study.
   In the latest study, volunteers' cholesterol levels fell
significantly both while eating lots of oat bran and while eating
equivalent amounts of low-fiber white flour and Cream of Wheat. But
they also cut their intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.
   ``They were meeting their caloric requirements, and they didn't
feel hungry,'' said Sacks. ``If they were eating Cream of Wheat in
the morning, they didn't have any room for bacon and eggs. If they
had high-fiber dinners, they weren't out eating pepperoni pizzas.
   ``That's probably what happens in real life.''
   The study, conducted on 20 volunteers, most of them hospital
dietitians, was directed by dietitian Janis F. Swain at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. It was published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   The volunteers ate seemingly identical muffins, meatloaf and
casseroles for two six-week periods. During one period, the foods
contained 100 grams, or 3{ ounces, of oat bran, while during the
other it contained that much white flour or Cream of Wheat.
   The volunteers could eat whatever else they wanted.
   On both the oat and non-oat regimens, their cholesterol levels
were about 7 percent lower than before they went on the diets.
   Before the diets, they were eating 12 percent of their daily
calories in the form of saturated fat. This fell to 10 percent
while on the high-fiber diet and 9 percent on the low-fiber diet.
Consumption of cholesterol dropped by one-third.
   Among the reports most widely cited in favor of oat bran was a
study conducted by dietitian Linda Van Horn at Northwestern
University. It found that substituting oat bran for other
carbohydrates in the diet lowered blood cholesterol levels by 3
percent.
   Her study attempted to keep fat consumption constant, and she
said the latest work does not shake her conviction that oat bran
and other forms of soluble fiber can lower cholesterol.
   ``With their small sample size and without the dietary control
necessary to monitor the situation, I don't know what this means,''
she said of the latest study.
   Bonny Lieberman, director of nutrition at the Washington-based
Center for Science in the Public Interest, said it may take five
more years of research to be certain if Sack's assertion is true.
   In the meantime, she said, it's clear that ``oat bran is not the
magic bullet that the food industry has led us to believe.''

   Nagasaki Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima, who has received
death threats since he said the late Emperor Hirohito bore some
responsibility for World War II, was shot Thursday outside City
Hall, a Nagasaki official said.
   City spokesman Megumi Nobeta said by telephone that the
67-year-old mayor was taken to Nagasaki Public Hospital immediately
after being shot at the entrance to City Hall as he was about to
get into a car.
   Nagasaki prefectural (state) police spokesman Hiroharu Naoe said
a single gunman shot Motoshima, hitting the mayor in the left side
of his chest, then fled in a white sedan. Police were searching for
him, Naoe said.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) said the mayor was conscious
after being shot and it quoted ambulance and fire department
officials as saying the bullet had not hit vital organs.
   The mayor was rushed into surgery within 45 minutes after he was
shot, NHK said doctors had stopped the bleeding and had not found
any bullets, indicating the bullet had passed through his body.
   Motoshima has been receiving threats from ultra-nationalists and
others since December 1988, when he said at a city assembly session
that he believed Hirohito, then on his deathbed, ``shares
responsibility for the war, as well as all of us who lived in that
period.''
   Motoshima also said Hirohito could have ended World War II
sooner and perhaps spared Nagasaki from the atomic bomb. Nagasaki
was hit by an atomic bomb on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after
Hiroshima became the first city to be hit by a nuclear weapon.
   The mayor's comments enraged fringe groups that reject any
criticism of the imperial family, and Motoshima continued to
receive threats even after Hirohito's death one year ago.
   In December, a right-wing doctor, 62-year-old Shigeru Kajiyama,
was sentenced to two years in prison for threatening to kill the
mayor. Testimony at his trial said he had sent three anonymous
letters containing live bullets to the mayor.
   In January 1989, a rightist was arrested after breaking into
City Hall with a knife intending to force Motoshima into retracting
his statement.
   Early last year, rightists mobilized about 100 sound trucks to
circle City Hall and blare slogans denouncing the mayor. Police at
one time had about 1,200 officers deployed to prevent trouble in
the city.
   Though the rightists made a great deal of noise, supporters of
the mayor's position sent him a petition with some 286,000
signatures in April calling for more freedom to express opinions,
even on taboo sugjects like the late emperor's war responsiblity.

<HEAD>International Group of Lawyers Plans to Challenge Screening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international group of lawyers is planning a
court challenge to the government screening process that determines
which Vietnamese boat people are to be forcibly repatriated, a
spokesman said today.
   ``We think that there are cases of persons who are genuine
refugees who have fallen through the cracks in the process'' and
were mistakenly classified as illegal immigrants, said David Clark,
senior lecturer in political science at Hong Kong University.
   This British colony once considered all Vietnamese who arrived
by boat to seek asylum as refugees eligible for resettlement
overseas.
   But the government, facing a mounting influx of Vietnamese,
decided in June 1988 to classify arriving boat people as illegal
immigrants subject to repatriation unless they could prove they
fled persecution in their Communist homeland.
   About 85 percent of the approximately 44,000 boat people who
have arrived under the new policy are expected to face forced
repatriation. The current screening process involves an interview
with an immigration officer and gives the opportunity for one
appeal.
   So far, 51 boat people have been forcibly repatriated and about
1,000 have gone back voluntarily.
   The London-based human rights organization Amnesty International
earlier this week criticized the program, saying immigration
officers often have scant knowledge of the situation in Vietnam and
that translating services need improvement.
   The group of lawyers, which includes members from the United
States and Britain, has selected nine boat people who were screened
out by immigration officials and had their appeals denied.
   ``We have evidence in those cases that there were various
defects'' in the process, said Clark. He added that the Vietnamese
chosen for the case appear to have a good claim to being classified
as refugees.
   The lawyers plan to go to the colony's High Court with their
complaints in a few weeks to seek the overturn of the screening
results, said Clark, who has taught administrative law in Hong Kong
for 11 years.
   ``It will be a tough case to win,'' he said. ``The government
will fight it tooth and nail.'
   If the High Court rules against the challenge, the lawyers'
group can take the case to the Court of Appeal in Hong Kong and
then the Privy Council in London.
   If that fails, the group may take action against the screening
process through the European Commission of Human Rights.
   The impetus for the legal challenge came largely from Americans
Arthur Helton, of the Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights; Janelle
Diller, of the Indochina Resource Action Center, and Briton David
Burgess.

<TEXT>
   A judge prepared to unseal verdicts today on
52 counts in a molestation case at a once prestigious nursery
school after jurors said they were deadlocked on the remaining 13
charges.
   Unless jurors indicate further deliberations might break their
deadlock, Superior Court Judge William Pounders was planning to
unseal the 52 verdicts that have already been returned by the panel
in the nation's longest and costliest criminal trial.
   ``Most likely we'll take the verdicts,'' Jim Gilpin, the bailiff
in Pounders' court, said Wednesday, after jurors sent the judge a
note at day's end announcing the deadlock.
   Pounders called a hearing for today to discuss the deadlock and
possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts.
   No alternate jurors remain in the case and the judge has worried
that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.
   Jurors have spent nine weeks deliberating on the molestation and
conspiracy charges against Raymond Buckey, 31, and his mother,
Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63. They are accused of molesting 11
children during a five-year period at their family-owned McMartin
Preschool in Manhattan Beach.
   The trial has run nearly three years at a cost of $15 million.
   If the impasse cannot be broken, the judge would declare a
mistrial on undecided counts and the prosecution would have the
option to refile those charges at a later time.
   Buckey and his mother were required to stand trial after an
18-month preliminary hearing.
   Five female teachers who worked at the McMartin Preschool had
charges against them dismissed. Among those were Buckey's sister,
Peggy Ann, and his grandmother, Virginia McMartin, who founded the
now defunct nursery school.
   Deliberations had been bogged down since Tuesday when one juror
became ill. On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m.
because another juror's child was ill.
   The judge, who will be the first to see the jury's verdict
forms, said he's been rehearsing maintaining a deadpan expression _
by biting his tongue if necessary _ when he first sees the verdicts.
   ``You will try to read the verdicts on my face,'' he told
lawyers. ``But I will wind up with a bloody tongue before I show
you (what the verdicts are). If there's any reaction on my face, it
will be, `Thank God it's over and we've got all the verdicts.' Then
you will see me beaming.''

<HEAD>Somalia Accused of Killing 50,000 Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major human rights group says Somalia's
government has in the past 19 months killed 50,000 to 60,000
civilians _ many shot in their homes _ whom it suspected of
supporting or sympathizing with insurgents.
   Somalia also has driven about a half-million others into exile,
said Africa Watch, a New York-based group.
   The group said Wednesday that most of the victims were members
of the Isaak clan. The army suspects the clan of supporting or
sympathizing with the Somali National Movement, a northern
insurgent organization.
   The movement, which draws its membership mostly from the Isaak
clan, is the largest in northern Somalia. It was formed in 1981 but
did not begin waging all-out war against the government until May
1988, when it attacked two main cities, Burao and Hargeisa.
   There was no immediate reaction to the allegations from the
socialist government of President Mohamed Siad Barre. Alleged
rights abuses have prompted Western donors to severely cut aid to
the Horn of Africa nation.
   Following the rebel attacks on the two provincial capitals,
Africa Watch said, ``the army turned its firepower, including its
air force and artillery, against the civilian population, causing
predictably high casualties.
   ``On the claim of looking for SNM fighters and weapons,
systematic house-to-house searches were carried out and thousands
were shot in their homes,'' Africa Watch said. ``Residential areas
were targets of artillery shelling.''
   Africa Watch said it estimated the casualty toll on the basis of
extensive interiews with refugees in neighboring Djibouti and the
United Kingdom, where a large Somali community lives in Cardiff,
Wales.
   Robert Gersony, a U.S. State Department consultant, conducted a
similar study last year and ``conservatively estimated that at
least 5,000 unarmed civilian Isaaks were purposefully murdered by
the Somali armed forces between May 1988 and March 1989.''
   The government has consistently denied that civilians have been
killed deliberately, saying any civilians deaths were the result of
``exceptional episodes'' or the unavoidable consequences of war.
   Africa Watch said the government is taking similar harsh
measures against civilians in central and southern Somali, where
two new rebel groups, the Somali Patriotic Movement and the United
Somali Congress, emerged in early 1989.
   But the organization acknowledged it had ``not been able to
gather sufficient information based on its own research'' to detail
alleged atrocities in those regions.
   Siad Barre, a major general said to be in his 80s, seized power
in a bloodless coup in October 1968 to prevent the election to the
presidency of a civilian opposed by the army.
   In recent years he has ruled a deteriorating nation beset by
tribal rebellions in the north and south, clan warfare, and a
bankrupt economy.
   Somalia became independent in 1960 after the unification of the
north and south, colonized by Britain and Italy respectively.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is advising
contact lens wearers who use Wet Cote lens solution to check the
numbers on their bottles to make sure they do not contain a
bacteria that could cause serious eye infections.
   The contaminated batch carries the lot number W3028 and the
expiration date 6-91 on the label, the FDA said Wednesday. It was
distributed in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
Ohio, North Carolina, Maryland, Tennessee and Illinois.
   Wet Cote, made by Occumed Inc. in Sarasota, Fla., is a wetting
solution designed for use with hard contact lenses.
   Seven of 20 bottles of Wet Cote from the batch that were
analyzed were found to be contaminated with a bacteria called
Pseudomonas cepecia, which can cause serious eye infections that
are difficult to treat and in rare cases lead to blindness, the FDA
said.
   The manufacturer recalled the product, but only about a third of
the 1,500 bottles produced were recovered, the agency said.
   The FDA advised consumers who have bottles of Wet Cote to check
the label and if the lot number shows it was from the contaminated
batch, not to use it but return the product to the place of
purchase.

<HEAD>Stronger Sanctions May Be Needed, Lawmakers Say</HEAD>

   The United States should consider tougher
sanctions against South Africa, which continues to drag its feet on
genuine reform of its racial policies, three members of Congress
say.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., leader of a delegation that visited
South Africa this month, said Americans shouldn't be fooled by
gestures such as the release of a few political prisoners.
   ``There's a tremendous yearning in this country to hope for the
best,'' he said. ``There's a real danger that we will end up
substituting the wish for the reality.''
   Anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa are demanding concessions
before endorsing President F.W. de Klerk's call for negotiations to
bring blacks into the government. ``If those preconditions are not
met, I don't doubt that there will be a growing movement in the
Congress and internationally to intensify sanctions,'' said Rep.
Alan Wheat, D-Mo.
   Wolpe, Wheat and Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., said at a news
conference Wednesday they were disappointed after their Jan. 4-9
trip that included meetings with de Klerk and other leaders in the
government and the opposition.
   ``The government seems to be clinging to the fantasy that
somehow conflict in South Africa can be reduced and the pressures
from without will be eased while the white minority continues to
hold to power and privilege,'' said Wolpe, chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa.
   The panel will begin hearings next month on proposals to further
restrict U.S.-South African economic ties, Wolpe said.

<HEAD>Gramm, Gingrich To Sponsor Tough New Anti-Crime Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Phil Gramm is promising to get tough on
drug thugs with a series of stiff anti-crime proposals that would
require most inmates to work and could deprive them of such prison
amenities as air-conditioning.
   But an official of the American Civil Liberties Union says the
plan is an election-year ploy that fails to address the causes of
drug abuse and drug dealing and ignores such issues as education,
treatment and prevention.
   ``Every election year we see these new, get-tough approaches to
the drug problem, and they're offered as though we haven't gotten
tough on the drug problem,'' said Gene Guerrero, a legislative
representative for the ACLU.
   Guerrero said drug use is actually down, prisoners are serving
longer sentences and prison populations have tripled since 1970.
The military is involved in the fight against drugs, yet more
potent drugs are more readily available at cheaper prices than ever.
   Gramm, R-Texas, and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
are proposing legislation that would declare a five-year national
drug and crime emergency act to ``deal with the problems of our
bleeding nation.''
   ``What I think we need to do is string some of these people
(criminals) up,'' Gramm told a Capitol news conference Wednesday.
   Gramm's bill would require mandatory sentences, without parole,
for federal drug and violent crime convictions. It also imposes
stiff penalties for drug users; allows states, local governments
and businesses to conduct random drug testing; and restricts the
courts' right to limit prison overcrowding.
   Under Gramm's proposed state of emergency, prisoners could be
housed in temporary space, including military bases or in tents,
while costs for building new prisons could be cut by eliminating
such non-essentials as air-conditioning.

   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov ordered a
partial mobilization of reserve troops, including young men
recently discharged, to cope with the bloody ethnic turmoil raging
in the Caucasus, Radio Moscow reported Thursday.
   Interior Ministry, KGB and Soviet Army units trying to put down
the Armenian-Azerbaijani violence that has left at least 66 people
dead and more than 200 people wounded have been authorized to fire
on gunmen who attack them or people who are trying to steal weapons.
   The Kremlin on Tuesday poured more than 11,000 additional troops
into the troubled mountain region 1,250 miles southeast of Moscow
in a bid to quell the deadliest round of violence in the most
protracted ethnic conflict facing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   To compensate for the depletion in the ranks caused by the
airlifts, Radio Moscow, quoting Yazov, said a partial mobilization
of reserves has been ordered in some areas of the Soviet Union to
make it easier to send reinforcements to the Caucasus.
   ``Recently demobilized young men are being recalled,'' the
state-run radio said. It did not give figures.
   It was unclear whether the mobilization would mean a freeze or
reversal in Gorbachev's plan, announced in December 1988 at the
United Nations, to slash the nation's armed forces by 500,000 men
as part of a campaign to reduce East-West tensions.

<HEAD>Gov't Won't Give Traffickers Amnesty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco's government
has refused to give Colombian drug traffickers the amnesty they are
now requesting, saying they will have to take their chances in the
courts if they surrender.
   Traffickers from the Medellin cocaine cartel said in a
communique Wednesday that the government has won its war against
drugs traffickers, and offered to dismantle their empire in
exchange for a pardon.
   They released two kidnap victims to back up the offer, which was
similar to previous proposals rejected by the government except for
its acceptance of defeat.
   Also Wednesday, a Colombian brother and sister were flown to the
United States to face cocaine-trafficking charges, bringing to 13
the number of Colombians extradited to the United States since
Barco launched the crackdown in August.
   In the 11-point communique, which was carried by one of the
freed kidnap victims, the traffickers said: ``We accept the triumph
of the state ... Thus we will lay down our arms and abandon our
objectives for the benefit of the highest interests of the
fatherland.''
   The communique, like others from the traffickers, was signed by
The Extraditables, the name of the Medellin cartel's armed wing.
   The drug cartel's communique followed Barco's comment, in
response to reporters' questions Tuesday night, that his government
is not ``inflexible'' regarding a negotiated settlement with drug
lords.
   Previously, Barco ruled out talks.
   But Wednesday night, Minister of Government Carlos Lemos
Simmonds said in a television interview that the government's
position of not negotiating with the traffickers stands.
   ``I don't see why we have to change our position when our own
enemies have declared that that position has won out,'' Lemos
Simmonds told Channel 7 News, a nationwide program.
   Barco, President Bush and the leaders of the cocaine-producing
countries of Peru and Bolivia have joined forces to fight drug
traffickers. They are expected to sign an accord to that effect at
a drug summit in Cartagena, Colombia, on Feb. 15.
   Patricia Echavarria, who was kidnapped Dec. 16 in Medellin along
with her daughter, carried the communique when the two were freed
Wednesday in Medellin.
   ``We submit to the existing legal establishment in the hope of
obtaining from the government and from society respect for our
rights and our return to our families and communities,'' the
communique said.
   That has been the traffickers' way in the past of saying they
want pardons and to not be extradited to the United States.
   ``We have decided to suspend the shipment of drugs and surrender
the weapons, explosives, laboratories, hostages, the clandestine
landing strips and other effects related to our activities at such
a time as we are granted constitutional and legal guarantees,'' it
continued, reiterating previous offers.
   Presumably, government pardons would mean none of the
traffickers would be prosecuted for the murders of scores of people
in Colombia, including governmment officials, judges, journalists,
and members of security forces.
   The communique said Mrs. Echavarria and her daughter, Dina, had
been freed as proof of the cartels' desire to make peace.
   Barco began his crackdown on drug dealers five months ago after
drug lords assassinated leading presidential candidate Sen. Carlos
Galan, who demanded more action against drug trafficking. By law,
Barco can't run for re-election.
   As part of the crackdown, Barco revived Colombia's extradition
treaty with the United States, something feared by Colombian
traffickers.
   In the latest extradition, Diana Maria Caballero Rangel Gamber,
29, and Roberto Caballero Rangel, 32, were turned over to U.S.
marshals by Colombian authorities, the Marshals Service said.
   The two were arrested Oct. 20 by Colombian authorities in
Bucaramanga on trafficking charges stemming from a 1988 indictment
in the United States.
   Drug traffickers have responded to the government crackdown with
a terror campaign that has killed 209 people, including 107 who
died when a bombed jet crashed outside Bogota in November.
   More than 1,200 people have been injured in the attacks.
   In the last 45 days, 85 people have been kidnapped, and police
believe most of them were abducted by the traffickers.
   In the communique, the traffickers offered to act as
intermediaries to end violence by groups fighting for control of
Colombia's emerald mines and to stop activities of right-wing death
squads.
   In the last four years, death squads have killed more than 1,000
people suspected of being sympathizers with Marxist guerrilla
groups.

   Among the refugees milling around the Armenian
republic's office in Moscow was a 49-year-old music teacher, her
face swollen and blackened from a fractured jaw, her broken left
wrist and two fingers encased in plaster.
   ``They are killing us,'' said Alisa Arakelova.
   Along with dozens of other Armenian refugees from the ethnic
strife in the southern Caucasus, she had gravitated to the Armenian
mission Wednesday in search of help.
   Armenian media say some 1,500 refugees from Azerbaijan are
arriving daily in Yerevan, capital of the bordering republic of
Armenia.
   In all, more than 7,000 Armenians have been evacuated from the
Azerbaijani capital of Baku, the reports say.
   No matter what, Arakelova said, she will never go back to Baku.
   Authorities say dozens of people have been killed since
anti-Armenian riots in the city Saturday night touched off
Armenian-Azerbaijani battles in the hills around the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Most of the victims have been Armenians, attacked by mobs in
Baku.
   Arakelova fled for Moscow days before the outbreak, but not
before falling victim to an ethnically motivated attack.
   She said some Azerbaijani men broke into her apartment a week
ago and ``they began beating me with everything they could find,''
including a brick and a heavy wooden pole.
   She fled that night, and, along with her two children and
mother, left her hometown a few days later, not even stopping to
find the identity papers she must produce to check into a Soviet
hotel. ``They took all my property, and there is somebody living in
my apartment already,'' she said.
   She said the police had lost control of the city and advised
them to leave.
   Armenian refugees gathered at the Armenian mission traded
horrendous stories of atrocities, but none claimed to be direct
witnesses.
   The official Tass news agency reported that people were set on
fire in Baku and a Russian resident said she saw women dangled and
dropped from balconies.
   Many of the Armenians vilified Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, blaming him for failing to halt the violence that has
torn the two southern republics for nearly two years.
   They yelled that Gorbachev was an oppressor, and a poor learner
who had yet to understand the blooy history of the Caucasus.
   The refugees at the mission and government newspaper Izvestia
said much of the violence in Baku involves Azerbaijani refugees
from Armenia forcing Armenians from their apartments so they will
have a place to live.
   Izvestia said tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis who fled ethnic
violence in Armenia in late 1988 remain without homes or jobs in
Baku.
   There have been no reports of new waves of Azerbaijani refugees.
   The Armenians in the Moscow mission did not seem to be getting
any help. There were no officials in sight, and many simply left
after doing no more than exchanging their bitterness with others in
the same plight.

<HEAD>Swaggart: Tax Ruling Breaches Constitutional Protections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
California can tax religious items sold by Jimmy Swaggart
Ministries could lead to selective taxation of unpopular religious
groups, the evangelist said.
   ``Now it is clear that all taxes, including income taxes, put on
business can now be put on churches,'' Swaggart said. ``Now we have
the real threat of intrusion of government into the religious
ministry of churches and synagogues.''
   Wednesday's unanimous ruling upheld lower court rulings that
California could collect $183,000 in back taxes on books, records,
tapes and other items produced and sold by the Baton Rouge-based
ministry between 1974 and 1981.
   Mail-order sales from Swaggart's Louisiana base to California
consumers during those years totaled $1.7 million. Sales of
merchandise at California crusades totaled $240,000.
   The evangelist did not challenge California's taxing of
T-shirts, mugs, bowls and crown-of-thorns replicas sold by his
ministry during the period.
   His challenge of the California tax had been supported by an
array of religious groups _ including Hare Krishnas and mainline
Protestants.
   Lawyers for the National Council of Churches, representing most
Protestant denominations, called the California tax ``a serious
threat ... a tax on the dissemination of religious messages, and
thus a forbidden tax on the exercise of religion.''
   Swaggart, whose ministry was damaged by a 1987 scandal arising
from his alleged dalliances with a New Orleans prostitute, said the
court's decision could have ominous consequences.
   ``Unpopular religions, small religions that don't please one
particular state government could conceivably be taxed out of
business because many churches derive a great part of their incomes
from the sale of tapes, records, Bibles, et cetera,'' he said.
   Most states tax the proceeds of at least some mail order sales
to their residents, but California and Virginia appear to be the
only states that do not exempt religious organizations.
   Other states searching for additional tax revenues now could
follow California's lead.
   The Supreme Court said the California taxes do not violate
religious freedom.
   ``California's non-discriminatory sales and use tax law ...
imposes no constitutionally significant burden on (Swaggart's)
religious practices or beliefs,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote
for the court.
   Swaggart's lawyers had relied on a 1943 high court ruling that
overturned the convictions of Jehovah's Witnesses who violated a
city ordinance requiring all people engaged in door-to-door
canvassing to get licenses and pay fees.
   But Wednesday's decision drew a distinction between those fees
and the California tax.
   ``Our concern (in the 1943 ruling) that a flat license tax would
act as a precondition to the free exercise of religious beliefs is
simply not present where a tax applies to all sales and uses of
tangible personal property in the state,'' O'Connor wrote.

<HEAD>Rivera Says The 1990 `Geraldo' Is a Return To His Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kinder, gentler ``Geraldo''?
   Perish the thought, say producers of the troubled, daytime
television talk show who nonetheless are trying to veer away from
such topics as battered lesbian lovers and topless doughnut shops.
   ``This is a return to my roots,'' Geraldo Rivera said Wednesday
at the National Association of Television Program Executives
convention, where he and his producers are gamely making the best
of the worst thing to hit Geraldo since a skinhead's chair in 1988.
   The show, straining for more viewers during the November 1989
ratings period when it went up against ``The Oprah Winfrey Show''
in 125 markets, ``went a little wild,'' said executive producer
Martin M. Berman.
   They also irritated a number of big, important sponsors, which
irritated a number of big, important TV stations, eliciting what
Berman called ``station concerns, advertiser concerns.''
   The producers reacted quickly to the criticism and commissioned
surveys of stations, advertisers and viewers.
   ``They did not want to see a less provocative show. They did not
want to see a `kinder, gentler' Geraldo,'' Berman said. ``But at
the same they didn't want to see Geraldo doing the kind of subjects
that they believed were not subjects that Geraldo was comfortable
with.
   ``And Geraldo said, `Well, they're right, I'm not comfortable
with this. It's not what I want to do. It's not the legacy I want
to leave.'''
   The fine-tuning began around Thanksgiving, Berman said, and for
the past seven weeks there has been no decrease in the ratings.
   ``The fact is that for the last seven weeks we've done no shows
that would fit into that exploitive, sensational category,'' he
said.
   Next week, the show will announce the formation of an
investigative unit to ``do some serious investigative stuff as part
of the mix.''
   ``We're not changing, we're just shifting the profile of our
repertoire away from the bottom end of it,'' he said.
   Berman said ``Geraldo'' would leave the convention with
virtually its full lineup of stations, and has struck deals with
some stations to use the show through September 1993.
   Ads for the show promise that in 1990, ``you'll experience a
better balance of personal and public topics and information, a
wider range of important issues in the social, moral and political
arenas, more responsiveness to local stations and a more sensitive,
more concerned, more humanitarian Geraldo.''
   The show has its work cut out for it, said John Rohr, a senior
marketing executive for Blair Television, which is the sales
representative for about 145 TV stations.
   ```Geraldo' probably will be renewed for next fall, but the
preponderance of time periods he will get will be morning time
periods,'' Rohr said.
   Morning is a lot less expensive in terms of the licensing fees
that TV stations pay for their programs. Conversely, it's a lot
less lucrative for the program than, say, ``early fringe time,'' 4
to 6 p.m. EST, when there are many more viewers at the tube and
advertisers pay more to run their commercials.
   ``Even if he doesn't change, he is less of a liability than he
is in the afternoon,'' Rohr said.
   Rivera says he's enjoying the fine-tuning of his show.
   ``For better or worse, I've been singing the same words for 20
years,'' Rivera said. ``This is a return to my roots. I want to go
back to busting crooked doctors.''

<HEAD>Stocks Down In Tokyo, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yet another rumor, this time about interest rates,
stopped an upturn by the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index today,
and a rumor about oil helped the dollar edge up against the
Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 91.68 points, or 0.25
percent, closing at 36,729.46.
   It had gained more than 170 points in early trading, but market
players were selling in the afternoon on a rumor that the Bank of
Japan soon would raise the nation's official discount rate.
   The central bank had raised the key rate for lending to
commercial banks three times last year to the current 4.25 percent.
Although monetary officials have ruled out another increase soon,
economists say there is inflationary pressure in Japan. The market
is speculating that another rate increase would be considered the
most effective monetary policy to stem inflation.
   After falls of more than 650 points in the Nikkei for two
consecutive trading days, the market started turning up on
Wednesday, only to start down again on a rumor that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would resign.
   ``The market has been very sensitive to rumors lately, partly
because it is pessimistic and lacking energy,'' said Tadahiro
Makita, a dealer with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   Rumors about Gorbachev affect shares in companies thought likely
to profit from increased trade with reforming East bloc countries.
   Declining Japanese goverment bond prices also have been
discouraging the stock market, and the price of bond futures was
down 0.87 today to 96.42, bringing the yield as high as 6.85
percent, the highest level in five years.
   The discount rate rumor contributed to sell-offs in the bond
market, dealers said.
   Stock trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at
530 million shares, down from Wednesday's 550 million.
   The dollar closed at 145.66 yen, up 0.14 yen from Wednesday's
145.52-yen close. It opened at 145.48 yen, its low for the day, and
went as high as 145.75 yen.
   Investors were selling yen in the afternoon when some market
players spread a rumor that petroleum supplies from Saudi Arabia
would decline, said Naozumi Tsusumi, a trader with Daiwa Bank.
   ``Somebody spread the rumor to move the market because it was
inactive due to a lack of fresh market-affecting news,'' he said.
   A larger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit in November, announced
Wednesday in Washington, did not help the yen recover, he said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported the nation's trade deficit
in November rose to $10.50 billion from a revised $10.25 billion in
October. Some economists had predicted a deficit of around $9.4
billion.
   The Bank of Japan sold an estimated $200 million to check the
dollar's rise. The central bank does not comment on its exchange
market activity.

<HEAD>Government Camp Indicates Forming New Conservative Party</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to reshape South Korea's
faction-ridden politics took a new turn today when President Roh
Tae-woo's governing party indicated it would dissolve itself to
form a new ``grand'' conservative party.
   The move by the governing Democratic Justice Party, coupled with
strenuous efforts by the two centrist opposition parties to merge,
made the country's political picture complex.
   ``We will actively respond to moves by the two opposition
parties to merge,'' said the governing party's secretary general,
Park Jun-byung.
   Another Democratic Justice official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``It is possible that we would consider forming a
new pan-national, centrist party representing all democratic
groups.''
   If the new conservative party is formed, the governing party
could be folded and its leader, Roh, would give up party membership
and stay neutral, the same official said.
   Kim Young-sam, head of the No. 2 opposition group, said today
that he would firm up plans next month to merge his Reunification
Democratic Party with the No. 3 opposition group, the New
Democratic Republican Party, led by former premier Kim Jong-pil.
   The two opposition leaders earlier agreed in principle to merge
their parties possibly before local elections, scheduled in the
first half of this year.
   ``It would not be a simple merger of two parties. The new party
to be born would be a central force comprising all conservative
groups,'' Kim Young-sam told reporters.
   Kim said his ultimate goal is to make the present four-party
system into a bipartisan setup.
   If the two parties merge, it would become the largest opposition
group, replacing Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy.
   The emergence of a centrist opposition party would be welcome
news for the governing party, which has been trying to isolate and
discredit Kim Dae-jung's liberal, pro-reform party.
   Kim Dae-jung, holding a news conference today, vehemently
opposed the planned merger by his opposition rivals, contending an
artificial restructuring of the present four-party system would
only benefit Roh's governing party.
   He said the government camp would try to use the planned
opposition merger to seek a conservative alliance, through which it
would try to remain in power beyond 1993, when Roh steps down at
the end of a single five-year term.
   Many politicians believe the government camp also favors a
political realignment that would enable it to hold onto power as
Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party does.
   If its plan to merge or seek alliance with opposition moderates
is successful, the government camp, assured of enough votes in the
Assembly, would propose a constitutional amendemnt to change the
present presidential system into a Cabinet setup headed by a prime
minister, they said.
   The governing party, with 127 seats in the Assembly, is
currently far short of a two-third majority required for a
constitutional amendment.
   South Korea's politics are currently controlled by four main
parties, neither of which has a controling majority in the
299-member National Assembly. The three main opposition parties
have a combined majority in the single house but intense rivalry
makes it difficult for them to cooperate.
   At his news conference, Kim Dae-jung said he would try to rally
support from ``centrist democratic forces'' to counter moves by his
rivals to merge or seek alliance. However, his proposal lacked
details.
   He also reiterated that his party would, if the government
endorses the plan, send delegates to communist North Korea in the
first half of this year to discuss national unification.
   If the dispatch of the party delegation is proven successful,
Kim said he would visit Pyongyang with government approval to meet
with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung
   He said President Roh responded favorably when he raised the
issue last week. But presidential and government officials said the
opposition plan to send delegates to the north was premature.

<HEAD>Group Finds Anti-Semitic Incidents Rose in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of anti-Semitic incidents attributed
to neo-Nazi skinheads jumped nearly 200 percent last year, the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith reported.
   The total number of incidents rose almost 12 percent to 1,432 _
the highest number recorded in the 11 years the ADL has conducted
an audit on the subject.
   The ADL said incidents of anti-Jewish vandalism and desecrations
rose 3 percent, to 845, in 1989. They included cases of arson,
bombings, cemetery desecrations and swastika-daubings against
Jewish institutions, Jewish-owned property and public property.
   There were five bombings, four in California, and eight arson
attacks, according to Wednesday's audit.
   Last year also saw 587 episodes of harassment, assault or
threats against Jews or Jewish institutions, a 28 percent jump over
1988, the study found. The total includes the June killing of Max
Kowalski, a 72-year-old Holocaust survivor who police said was
beaten and stabbed after confronting a man he accused of scrawling
a swastika on his door in a Brooklyn boarding house.
   Abraham H. Foxman, ADL national director, said in a statement
that the record numbers were disturbing, but not surprising
considering ``the rise in hate-inspired violence generally around
the country.''
   The audit reflects incidents in 44 states and the District of
Columbia, as reported to the ADL's regional offices and law
enforcement officials.
   Among 1989's findings:
   _ A record 116 incidents of anti-Semitism in 24 states were
attributed to neo-Nazi skinheads, 180 percent more than in 1988. Of
the 144 people arrested in connection with anti-Semitic incidents
in 14 states last year, 21 were identified as skinheads; 125 were
under 21 years old.
   _ Anti-Semitic incidents on college campuses rose 30 percent in
1989, to 69 reported on 51 campuses; among the most serious was the
October beating of two Jewish students at Brooklyn College on the
eve of Yom Kippur.
   The ADL called for increased efforts by law-enforcement
authorities to apprehend perpetrators; strict enforcement of
anti-bias crime statutes; and community information and action
programs.

   Boston University President John Silber's entry
into the Massachusetts governor's race is only the latest in a
lifetime of audacious acts.
   The 63-year-old transplanted Texan, who voted for presidents
Reagan and Bush and has described himself as elitist and populist,
announced Wednesday that he will seek the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination.
   He said he can turn the crumbling Massachusetts economy around
with a little old-fashioned grit and conservatism.
   ``In recent years, I have become increasingly dissatisfied with
the direction of the Democratic Party,'' he said. ``It has become
increasingly a party of very narrow special interests and
single-issue politics.''
   The governorship became a wide-open race a year ago when Michael
S. Dukakis announced he would not seek another term when his third
term expires at the end of 1990.
   Silber joins three others seeking the Democratic nomination: Lt.
Gov. Evelyn Murphy, former state Attorney General Francis Bellotti
and state House Taxation Committee Chairman John Flood.
   Former federal prosecutor William Weld, state House Minority
Leader Steven Pierce, former U.S. Rep. Paul Cronin and former
Metropolitan District Commissioner Guy Carbone are among those
seeking the Republican nomination.
   Silber, a man with no previous political experience, relishes
change _ but his way.
   He can count among his admirers Henry Kissinger, who served with
him on the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America.
   Kissinger said of Silber last year: ``When he first started, my
only question was if I killed him, would it be considered murder or
justifiable homicide? He is very fierce in his convictions. He
takes no prisoners. I swore I'd kill him and then, as the weeks
went by, I grew extremely fond of him.''
   Silber has long defied the pigeonholers.
   He said that at the age of 10 he defended FDR to his father. But
he also is fiercely anti-communist and favors U.S. intervention
abroad.
   ``His views have been consistently arch-conservative on almost
every single issue,'' Arnold Offner, a BU historian said recently
of Silber, with whom he has had differences. ``His views are much
more congenial with the Reagan part of the world than the
Democratic Party on foreign policy.''
   Silber's 95-year-old mother, who joined him at Wednesday's
announcement, was a schoolteacher; his father, an architect who had
emmigrated from Germany.
   They raised their son as a Christian; when Silber went to the
University of Bonn on a Fulbright scholarship and after his father
had died, he discovered his father was Jewish and a sister of his
father's had died at Auschwitz.
   Silber, the father of seven children, was 44 when he took over
Boston University 19 years ago after being fired as dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin.
   He steadily transformed an academically uneven school burdened
by a projected deficit of $8.8 million into one of the country's
more respected private institutions.
   Last year, the 26,000-student school across the Charles River
from MIT and Harvard boasted revenues of $464.8 million, an
endowment of $183 million and a budget approaching $500 million.
   Silber did much of it through hard work. His office is open from
8 a.m. to 8 p.m., with a staff that works in shifts to keep up with
his 80-hour to 100-hour workweek.
   Silber has appointed nearly 90 percent of the current faculty,
he has been faithful to those he has supported. He is disdainful of
professors he believes are incompetent or lazy, and openly refers
to them as ``third-raters.''
   He was 5 years old before realizing his right arm was withered,
he has said. Soon enough he also discovered the hard bone of the
stub was useful in boyhood fights.
   He is an active Kant scholar, a frequent public speaker, and the
author of a book published last year that is characteristically
bold.
   Its title: ``Straight Shooting: What's Wrong With America and
How to Fix It.''

   Adam West, the Caped Crusader in the
``Batman'' TV show, lost his dynamic duel against advertising
agencies that produced a commercial using an actor who had his Bat
moves down well.
   West, who still dresses up as Batman for public appearances,
sought $900,000 in damages for invasion of privacy, unfair
competition and unauthorized use of an endorsement.
   But Burbank Superior Court Judge Stephen O'Neil ruled Wednesday
that the central issue was a contractual one that had nothing to do
with West's portrayal of Batman.
   ``Adam West is a talented actor, but he was an actor, not the
creator of Batman,'' O'Neil said.
   West, 59, said the actor in the commercial ``whirled as Adam
West would whirl to go to the bat poles.''
   The 30-second commercial was produced for Zayre, a
Massachusetts-based discount store chain.
   Defendants were North Hollywood producers Ian Leech and
Associates; Ingalls, Quinn and Johnson of Boston and the
advertising agency BBDO New York.
   The defendants have said West holds no rights to his portrayal
of Batman; DC Comics owns the rights. O'Neil said the advertising
agencies involved in the commercial had paid DC Comics for the
right to use the likeness of the Batman character.
   West had insisted the imposter trampled on his artistic
expression.
   ``When you look at the Mona Lisa, you don't think of identifying
the copy with the original,'' he said.

   A videotape showing a young man
writhing in pain after being shot three times in the chest is a key
piece of evidence against a man charged with two murders and the
attempted slaying of his wife.
   Konstantinos Fotopoulos, 30, is charged with hiring two men to
kill his wife, Lisa, 29, the daughter of a wealthy Greek immigrant.
Court records show six mostly bungled attempts to kill her over
five days.
   Mrs. Fotopoulos suffered a gunshot wound to the head in the
final attempt on Nov. 4, but says she has recovered.
   Bryan Chase, the man allegedly hired to kill Mrs. Fotopoulos for
$5,000, is dead, shot by Fotopoulos, who told police Chase was
burglarizing his home and had shot his wife.
   Fotopoulos now is charged with the murder of Chase, of plotting
his wife's killing and in the killing of 19-year-old Mark Kevin
Ramsey, whose death was captured on videotape.
   Also charged is Deidre Michelle Hunt, who told authorities that
she killed Ramsey while Fotopoulos videotaped the slaying.
   All involved in the case are barred from discussing it because
of a gag order imposed by a judge who became incensed when he
learned of re-enactments of parts of the case on the syndicated
television shows, ``A Current Affair'' and ``Inside Edition.''
   But search warrants, police affidavits and arrest reports
unsealed Tuesday help complete a portrait of Fotopoulos.
   Daytona Beach police Lt. Charles Evens described the 57-second
videotape of Ramsey's grisly killing in one of the court documents.
   ``The camera then pans to the face of Kevin Ramsey and then back
to Deidre. She says, `Ready?' The male voice says, `OK.' With that,
Deidre draws the gun from her right side, aims at the chest of
Kevin Ramsey and fires three times into the chest. Kevin grunts
with pain and says, `God.' He then says, `Ahhhh' and lifts his left
leg in pain. With that, Deidre walks to him, grabs his hair, raises
his head up and puts the gun to his left temple area and fires once
more. Kevin falls forward and is silent. His hands can be seen tied
behind him with rope. Video ends.''
   The male voice was identified as Fotopoulos, who Evens said shot
Ramsey in the head with a rifle.
   Ramsey was an employee of Fotopoulos, but the unsealed court
documents give no motive for his killing.
   An indictment alleges that Fotopoulos hired Chase, 18, to break
into his house and kill his wife. Then, thinking his wife had been
shot to death, Fotopoulos allegedly killed Chase to silence him.
   Police initially thought Fotopoulos was a husband protecting his
home and wife.
   But detectives noticed that Chase had entered the house through
one of the few windows not hooked to an alarm system, had walked
past bedrooms occupied by Mrs. Fotopoulos' mother and brother,
ignored expensive stereo equipment and other property, and had gone
straight to the couple's bedroom where he shot Mrs. Fotopoulos.
   The indictment says Ms. Hunt, 20, worked for Fotopoulos at Top
Shots, a billiard hall he owned on Daytona Beach's boardwalk,
arranged for the hiring of Chase and served as the contact between
Fotopoulos and the hit men.
   She and Fotopoulos are charged with first-degree murder in the
deaths of Ramsey and Chase; conspiracy to commit murder in planning
the death of Mrs. Fotopoulos, Ramsey, and Chase; attempted
first-degree murder, and solicitation to commit murder.
   Also arrested were Teja Mzimmia James, 22, and Yvonne Lori
Henderson. They are charged with conspiracy to commit first-degree
murder in the shooting of Ms. Fotopoulos; attempted first-degree
murder, and solicitation to commit murder.
   All four are being held without bail.

   A judge set an early March date for ousted
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega's drug trafficking trial to open,
but he expressed doubt that the timetable would be met.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler set a March 5 date only
when pressed Wednesday for a speedy trial by attorneys for one of
Noriega's co-defendants, Luis del Cid.
   But Hoeveler, indicating the case's complexity, made it clear
postponements were likely.
   ``We will set the date for that week,'' he said, ``but of
course, there will be further motions and we will just have to see
what will happen.''
   On Tuesday, Noriega attorney Steven Kollin said that he and
co-counsel Frank Rubino might need up to two years to prepare
Noriega's defense.
   Rubino and Kollin refused to comment on the judge's ruling.
   ``Sam wants to try his case,'' was Rubino's only comment,
referring to del Cid's attorney, Samuel Burstyn.
   Noriega, del Cid, and 14 others were named in a February 1988
federal grand jury indictment returned in Miami on drug,
racketeering and money-laundering charges.
   Burstyn reminded Hoeveler that the judge still hadn't ruled on
motions calling for separate trials for del Cid and several other
co-defendants.
   Also Wednesday, Noriega's sole co-defendant in a separate Tampa
marijuana trafficking indictment was extradited to the United
States after surrendering to FBI agents in Panama.
   Enrique Pretelt, 47, a Panamanian businessman, was scheduled to
appear today in a Tampa courtroom, according to Justice Department
spokesman Michael W. Robinson in Washington. Pretelt is charged
with trying to smuggle more than 1 million pounds of marijuana into
the United States.
   In a separate development Wednesday, convicted Colombian cocaine
kingpin Carlos Lehder said in an interview broadcast by NBC-TV that
he and his associates paid Noriega millions of dollars for
protection for about 10 years.
   In the interview, videotaped in November at the federal prison
in Marion, Ill., for the West German magazine Stern, Lehder said
Noriega took all drugs and drug paraphernalia seized in Panama and
sold them to drug dealers in Colombia, Panama and the United States.
   Rubino refused to comment later Wednesday on Lehder's
statements, saying he hadn't seen the broadcast.
   Hoeveler continued del Cid's bond hearing, giving Burstyn and
co-counsel Kenneth Swartz, an assistant federal public defender, 10
days to respond to new evidence presented at the hearing by
Assistant U.S. Attorney Myles Malman.
   The judge set no date for the bond hearing to be reconvened, and
del Cid, 46, remained in custody without bond.
   Del Cid has pleaded innocent to charges he collected bribes and
acted as a liaison between Noriega and drug traffickers. If
convicted on all counts, del Cid faces up to 70 years in prison and
fines of up to $550,000.

earlier this week. Rain was expected along a front extending from
Texas to Maine.
   Arctic air and flurries were forecast near Lake Superior, while
cooler air crept into the Northeast.

conditions were expected to improve for Friday's planned space
shuttle landing.
   Advisories for frost were posted over parts of southwestern
California.
   A high wind watch was posted today in Utah's Cache Valley and
Wasatch Front.
   Snowfall from Wednesday's western winter storm included 5 inches

<HEAD>Jury Finds That Philadelphia Police Department Discriminated
Against Woman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury has awarded $2.44 million to
the city's first female homicide detective and the four officers
who supported her sex-discrimination complaint.
   Carol Keenan, 38, alleged she was the victim of a pattern of
discrimination, and her colleagues argued they were transferred out
of the homicide unit merely because they supported her.
   After two months of testimony, the U.S. District Court jury
Wednesday awarded the five officers $640,000 in compensatory
damages and $1.8 million in punitive damages.
   The largest part went to Keenan, now a detective in South
Philadelphia. The jury awarded her $220,000 in compensatory damages
and $600,000 in punitive damages.
   Keenan, who joined the police force in 1976, predicted the
verdict will help other women in the department.
   ``The next woman who makes this kind of complaint won't be
ignored _ they'll listen,'' she said.
   Keenan contended throughout the trial that she repeatedly tried
to resolve the problem informally, but officials refused to take
her complaints seriously.
   She filed the lawsuit in 1988, saying she was subjected to
unusual scrutiny by Robert Grasso after he became commander of
homicide. She also alleged discrimination led to her transfer from
the unit in 1987.
   She was joined in the lawsuit by Lawrence Gerrard, Walter Smith,
Ernest Gilbert and Daniel Rosenstein.
   The city planned to appeal.
   ``The verdict is totally out of proportion to justice, law and
reality and will be appealed from now to infinity,'' said Deputy
City Solicitor Richard G. Freeman.
   Jurors said they hoped their decision sends a message to the
city.
   ``I would say there was simply little, if any, defense,'' said
jury foreman Thomas Gilbert.
   Juror Harry Wilson Jr. said he hoped the verdict showed city
police officials ``that they have to be fair in their treatment of
all their employees, flat and simple.''

buying dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.66 yen, up 0.14 yen from
Wednesday's 145.52-yen close. Later in London, the dollar traded at
145.72 yen.

   Convicted killer Gerald Smith, who had said
he wanted to die, was executed by lethal injection early today,
becoming the second Missouri prisoner put to death in a
quarter-century.
   Smith, 31, of St. Louis, was pronounced dead at 12:09 a.m., said
Dick Moore, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections.
   Smith was executed for the 1980 beating death of Karen Roberts,
his former girlfriend in St. Louis. In a letter to a newspaper,
Smith said he murdered Ms. Roberts because he believed she gave him
a venereal disease.
   Smith's wife, Lynn, watched the execution along with
court-appointed defense attorney C. John Pleban.
   As the first lethal drug was administerred, Mrs. Smith raised
her left hand and made a ``V'' sign. She mouthed, ``I love you.''
   Smith became the 121st prisoner executed since the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed states to resume carryuing out the death penalty in
1976.
   Death-penalty opponents made a last-ditch effort to save Smith's
life by filing a motion Wednesday afternoon with the U.S. Supreme
Court, but the court voted 7-2 to reject the appeal by the Missouri
Capital Punishment Resource Center in Kansas City.
   Smith came close to execution several times before, but stays
were issued as he changed his mind about whether he wanted to die.
   Last week, Associate Justice Harry Blackmun stayed an execution
for Smith that was scheduled last Thursday to allow the court to
consider motions by Pleban.
   But the full court lifted that stay on Tuesday, and the Missouri
Supreme Court acted swiftly to schedule the execution.
   Smith also was under a death sentence for the 1985 slaying of
fellow death-row inmate Robert Baker.
   Opponents of capital punishment gathered for prayer services at
churches in St. Louis and Jefferson City.
   Gov. John Ashcroft was asked to reprieve Smith on Wednesday by
the Missouri Coalition Against The Death Penalty. The governor's
spokesman, Bob Ferguson, said Ashcroft would not interfere with the
judicial process.

   Zhivkov was ousted Nov. 10 after 35 years in power and as this
Balkan country was swept up by a peaceful popular revolt. He was
replaced by more moderate Communists who are promising a transition
to democracy.
   According to the announcement, a warrant was isued to ``remand
in custody'' the ousted dictator and that a team of prosecutors has
been assigned to conduct the investigation.
   The ousted leader is reportedly under government protection at a
house near the capital of Sofia.
   While BTA said the prosecutor general had initiated preliminary
investigative proceedings against Zhivkov, it also reported that he
was charged with ``incitement of ethnic hostility and hatred, with
unwarranted receiving of excessive amounts of public property and
with gross malfeasance.''
   BTA said the investigation was launched on the basis of
materials supplied by a parliamentary commission of inquiry into
the ``abuses and breaches of the law committed in the state, public
and economic life by the previous regime.''

   Zhivkov has been accused of abusing power by enriching himself
at the people's expense, damaging the economy through cumbersome
central planning and enforced discrimination against the country's
ethnic Turkish minority.
   Under his forced assimilation policy, the ethnic Turks were
forced to adopted ethnic Slavic names and their language and
religious rites were banned. The new government overturned that
policy on Dec. 29.
   Petar Mladenov, who took over from Zhivkov as Communist Party
leader, has promised reforms and free elections this year.
   On Monday Parliament repealed the Communist's guaranteed
monopoly on power, making Bulgaria the last Warsaw Pact country to
formally do so.
   The party is still powerful, however, and opposition groups
complain that it is not moving swiftly enough on reform.

   Paul Simon said he and Art Garfunkel would feel
at home in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, noting that their
relationship was rocky.
   ``We can join those other happy couples,'' he said at Wednesday
night's induction ceremony. ``Ike and Tina Turner, the Everly
Brothers, Mick (Jagger) and Keith (Richards), Paul (McCartney) and
all of the other Beatles.
   ``Maybe they'll have a separate wing for all of us, probably
completed in time for the Eagles to be in.''
   Despite their breakups, Simon called Garfunkel ``my oldest and
best friend'' more than once during his speech at the annual
black-tie dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
   While Simon and others celebrated, one inductee cried.
   Hank Ballard, who wrote ``The Twist,'' said he felt alone in
accepting his award. He said his wife, who also served as his
manager, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in New York three
months ago.
   ``When she took me on four years ago, she swore she was going to
take me back to the stars where I used to be,'' he said. ``It's
tragic she's not here tonight with me.''
   Besides Ballard, and Simon and Garfunkel, the acts inducted were
the Four Tops; the Who; Bobby Darin, who died in 1973, best known
for ``Splish Splash'' and ``Mack the Knife''; the Four Seasons; the
Kinks; and the Platters.
   One of the songwriting teams honored, Gerry Goffin and Carole
King, created their first hit ``Will You Love Me Tomorrow?'' for
the Shirelles, and followed it with ``Up on the Roof,''
``Loco-motion'' and ``Go Away Little Girl.''
   Brothers Brian and Eddie Holland and Lamont Dozier, a creative
cornerstone of the Motown sound of the 1960s, were honored for
writing more than 70 Top 10 hits. Three of their 20 No. 1 hits were
``(Reach Out) I'll Be There,'' ``You Keep Me Hangin' on'' and
``Stop in the Name of Love.''
   Three performers inducted for their early influences on rock 'n'
roll were Louis Armstrong, Charlie Christian and Ma Rainey.
   Armstrong, who died in 1971, was a trumpeter and singer, and
considered by some the greatest jazz musician of all time.
Christian, who died in 1942, was a jazz guitarist, the first to
play hornlike, single-string solos on electric guitar. Rainey, who
died in 1939, recorded nearly 100 blues songs after 1923 and
toured, popularizing the music.
   Stevie Wonder, inducting the Four Tops, said: ``If we could
imagine ourselves as being the Four Tops and be able to come
together with a sense of harmony and unity and make our own hits by
doing the right thing for 36 years, this country would truly be
written in the sands of time forever.
   ``Obie, Lawrence, Duke, Levi _ you truly are the sunshine of my
life.''
   The irreverent Kinks wore tuxedos to be inducted.
   ``Seeing everybody makes me realize rock 'n' roll has become
respectable,'' Ray Davies said. ``What a bummer.''
   Dodd Darin, only child of the late Bobby Darin, accepted the
induction of his father from Paul Anka.
   ``He was very much into rock 'n' roll,'' Anka said of Bobby
Darin. ``Because of him that form of music became much more
acceptable to the listening public.''
   Groundbreaking for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland
is planned for this year with a projected 1992 opening.
   After the ceremony, about 60 musicians, including Bruce
Springsteen, Roger Daltry and Peter Townshend of the Who, hopped up
on stage for a jam session.
   Those considered for induction had recordings released by the
end of 1964. Some 200 performers, producers, writers, record
executives and broadcasters selected by the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame Foundation made the choices.

   The murder of a star high school athlete, one
of 18 killings since Friday in the nation's capital, is prompting
President Bush to dub January ``the month of murder'' in the
District of Columbia.
   As Bush was decrying the carnage in the district, students,
coaches and faculty at McKinley High School on Wednesday mourned
the killing of 18-year-old Samuel Unger, a basketball and football
captain who was shot to death on Saturday.
   ``It's a very empty feeling, a horrible sensation,'' said Steve
Milam, Unger's basketball coach. ``He was a well-rounded student
and had the world ahead of him ... I hope that my son can grow up
to be like him.''
   Unger was one of 29 people killed in the nation's capital so far
in 1990, including a woman whose body, bearing multiple stab
wounds, was found in a parking lot early today. That rate is ahead
of the pace that led to a record 438 murders in 1989. In 1988, 369
were killed in the district.
   ``We have seen great progress where it counts, in the streets,
where record amounts of cocaine have been seized ... yet we have
yet to turn the corner,'' Bush told a luncheon with the heads of
federal law enforcement agencies.
   ``In this very city, January has been the month of murder, the
deadliest month in the history of the District of Columbia,'' the
president said.
   Last January, 52 people were killed in the nation's capital,
including 18 in the first two and one-half weeks.
   Police blame more than 60 percent of the killings on
drug-related violence.
   Police believe that Unger, who died after being shot in the head
Saturday night, was the victim of a robbery attempt. He was killed
less than a block from his home and one of the city's open-air drug
markets. Police said he was not selling drugs.
   However, WRC-TV, citing law enforcement sources, reported that
Unger had been arrested in December and charged with possessing
cocaine with the intent to distribute. Unger was charged as a
juvenile, the station noted in explaining why court records on the
case remained under seal.
   Mayor Marion Barry said he and Police Chief Isaac Fulwood were
working to come up with ways to help cut the surging homicide rate.
   ``We're going to do something different, I don't know what, but
we're going to do it,'' Barry said Wednesday. ``We cannot continue
to have people be killed on the streets of Washington, D.C.''

   President Bush hailed the ``superb
job'' of Columbia's astronauts today as they headed for Friday's
homecoming after taking control of their ship when a bad navigation
signal from the ground sent it into a slow spin.
   In a radio-phone call from the White House, the president termed
their rescue of a huge science satellite ``a very exciting grab,''
and he invited the five crew members to meet with him at the White
House after the mission.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein said the retrieval of the satellite
was a highlight among several important accomplishments of the
space journey.
   ``Well done _ we're proud of you,''' Bush said.
   The president also mentioned the erratic spin imparted to
Columbia by the faulty signal when he said, ``I'm calling to
congratulate you and the crew _ after all those somersaults _ for
doing this superb job up there.''
   Brandenstein had been roused from sleep during the night to
manually override the shuttle's navigation system. He stabilized
the craft until Mission Control transmitted correct guidance
signals.
   There was no danger to the five astronauts, but ``we had a
little excitement tonight,'' said flight director Bob Castle.
   After analyzing data, controllers reported that Columbia had
made four rotations in yaw (side-to-side), one rotation in pitch
(up-and-down of the nose and tail) and three-fourths of a rotation
in roll.
   At times, they said, all movements were taking place
simultaneously. Each rotation took two minutes, too slow for the
astronauts to sense while asleep.
   Another flight director, Lee Briscoe, said it appeared that ``a
couple of words got dropped'' in the navigation program, ``so the
vehicle thought it was around the center of the Earth'' instead of
repeatedly passing back and forth across the equator at a 28-degree
angle.
   The incident happened Wednesday night, about 2{ hours before
their scheduled wakeup. A false fire alarm also got them out of
their beds Wednesday.
   A third wakeup, at the planned time, was music to their ears: a
rendition of Washington and Lee University's fight song. One of the
astronauts, David Low, is a graduate of the school.
   ``Good morning, Columbia, after what must have been a restful,
or restless, night,'' the control center radioed.
   Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee successfully tested
Columbia's flight control systems to make sure they were in good
shape for returning home. During the 10-day mission the astronauts
have deployed a Navy communications satellite and retrieved an
11-ton science laboratory that had orbited for six years.
   Snow was falling this morning at the landing site at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., and about an inch had covered the desert before
dawn.
   Briscoe said forecasters were watching the weather closely, but
``it still looks good for tomorrow.'' The pre-dawn landing is
scheduled at 2:54 a.m. PST.
   Recent heavy rains have closed the public viewing area, and the
space agency discouraged citizens from driving to the base to watch
the touchdown.
   While Brandenstein and Wetherbee checked the shuttle's systems,
mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and Low completed a
series of medical and science experiments and began stowing them
away.
   Castle said Columbia began its slow spin after an errant
navigation signal from the ground caused six small steering jets in
the shuttle's nose to fire on and off, the longest for two minutes.
   That sent the shuttle into an unwanted spin of about 3 degrees a
second, or about one rotation every two minutes, Castle said.
   He said the navigation data had suffered radio interference
during the transmission, but that an operator on the ground failed
to catch it.
   Castle said that if nothing had been done, Columbia would have
continued to rotate at that rate, but there would be no threat to
the astronauts.
   ``I'm concerned about what happened because we have to find out
what happened and correct it,'' Castle said. ``But I'm not real
concerned. It was an error on the ground. Columbia did exactly what
Columbia should have done.''
   NASA spokesman Jack Kroehnke said the astronauts would not have
felt the spin imparted by the six thrusters, part of a system of 44
steering jets on the shuttle.
   ``If we had not awakened the crew, they'd eventually have
awakened themselves, I'm sure, and looked out to see the Earth view
changing in the windows,'' Kroehnke said.

   Older couples who drink coffee appear to
be more sexually active than elderly non-coffee drinkers, according
to a new study.
   In response to a survey, 62 percent of married women 60 and
older who drank coffee said they were sexually active. Forty
percent of women older than 60 who do not drink coffee said they
were active.
   Among married men the same ages, 36 percent of coffee drinkers
said they sometimes were impotent, compared with 59 percent of
those who don't drink coffee.
   The study in the January issue of the Archives of Internal
Medicine did not give a margin of error or date for the survey of
744 Michigan residents done by Dr. Ananias Diokno of William
Beaumont Hospital in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak.
   Diokno, attempting to explain the results, said coffee
stimulates the central nervous system and relaxes certain muscles.
But he said it also was possible that people who drink coffee also
happen to be ``more liberal in their sexual behavior.''
   ``We want to pursue this and find out why there is this
connection between sex and coffee,'' he said.
   The study team did not ask participants whether they drank
regular or decaffeinated coffee or how much they drank, Diokno said.
   Some researchers were skeptical of the findings.
   ``Oh, Lord help us, now they've linked coffee and sex,'' said
Gail Kershner Riggs, associate director of restorative medicine at
the University of Arizona's College of Medicine, who has done her
own research on sex among elderly women.
   ``Dr. Diokno is a respected researcher,'' said Dr. Tom Stanisic,
a professor of surgery and urology at the University of Arizona
College of Medicine in Tucson. ``But before anyone starts drinking
coffee to boost their sex life, it would be wise if other people
looked into this a little more.
   ``It's not something I would act on immediately.''
   Coffee and caffeine are popular research topics; more than 500
studies on their effects have been published in medical journals
since 1983. Some studies have linked coffee to heart disease, high
cholesterol levels and pancreatic cancer, while others found no
such relationship.
   Diokno's survey also found that about 75 percent of married
elderly men and 56 percent of married elderly women remain sexually
active, compared with 31 percent of unmarried elderly men and 5
percent of unmarried elderly women.

<HEAD>Woman Seeks to Force Father of Bone Disease Victim to Donate
Marrow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROANOKE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose 4-month-old son has a rare
bone disease is suing the child's father to force him to donate
bone marrow to save the boy's life.
   The boy has osteopetrosis, which affects bone growth. The
lawsuit filed Wednesday in Roanoke Circuit Court says the boy is
expected to live six to 12 months if he does not receive a bone
marrow transplant.
   Sue Argabright asked the court to force Sanford Andrew Moore to
undergo tests to determine if can donate bone marrow to the
couple's son, Andy.
   The lawsuit argues that Andy's biological father has ``a duty
and obligation'' to undergo ``minimally intrusive tests'' and, if
eligible, to donate bone marrow to his son.
   John Fletcher, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Virginia, said forcing the father to donate bone
marrow would set a bad precedent.
   ``Once you start to compromise donation by using force, then you
have opened the door for a lot of other things, including selling
organs,'' said Fletcher.
   ``The tradition in the United States for organ donation _
including donation between relatives _ is that it is a gift of
life,'' said Fletcher.
   University of Virginia officials said they are searching bone
marrow registries to find potential donors.
   The lawsuit says a biological parent is much more likely to be a
suitable bone marrow donor than a stranger. However, Ms. Argabright
was tested and was found to be an unsuitable donor, the lawsuit
said.
   Ms. Argabright issued a public appeal for donations earlier this
week, saying she could not afford to pay for the transplant, which
doctors have told her could cost as much as $180,000.
   She said she gets no support money from Moore and has no private
health insurance. It was not clear if Ms. Argabright and Moore have
ever been married.
   Moore could not be located for comment. Someone answering his
phone Wednesday said he would be out of town until Friday.
   Most of Andy's medical expenses so far have been covered by
Medicaid, Ms. Argabright said, but the Virginia Medicaid program
does not pay for transplants for children.
   Osteopetrosis prevents the body from breaking down and reforming
bone. Bones become increasingly brittle and deposits build up,
putting pressure on the optic and auditory nerves.
   Doctors say Andy probably will be blind and deaf by his first
birthday.

<DATELINE>PRAVEC, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two months after hard-line
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted, signs of change are few
in his hometown, a sleepy lakeside resort nestled among mountains
northeast of Sofia.
   Like many Bulgarians, people in Pravec still harbor serious
doubts that after more than 40 years of authoritarian rule the
sweeping democratic reforms promised by Zhivkov's Communist
successors will materialize in the near future. Skepticism appears
to run deeper in the countryside than in the capital, Sofia.
   On a narrow, fir tree-lined lane, Zhivkov's family house _ one
of over 30 luxurious residences he kept nationwide _ is shuttered
up, the white-walled garden decked in snow untrodden for weeks.
   Hefty stone street signs that until recently bore the name of
Zhivkov's mother, Marutsa Zhivkova, have been replaced by new
plaques dubbing the road Vassil Levsky _ after Bulgaria's most
revered national hero.
   In Sofia, tens of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators have
taken to the streets regularly since the former leader's overthrow
Nov. 10, demanding quicker steps toward democracy from former
foreign minister-turned-reformist leader Petar Mladenov.
   But Pravec, only 19 miles away, is another world.
   ``In principle there has been no change whatsoever,'' said Velin
Ogledalov, chief cook at the pagoda-roofed Shatra restaurant, where
Zhivkov often held state dinners for visitors that included former
Romanian dictator _ and honorary Pravec citizen _ Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``The Bulgarians are thinking: `We have taken a load off our
shoulders,' but there is still fear,'' said Ogledalov.
   ``Department Six (secret police) used to be everywhere. And
they're still there, only now they're smiling,'' he added.
   In early January, the burly 34-year-old set up Pravec's first
independent trade union, which is campaigning for multiparty
democracy, private enterprise and free-market economics.
   He claims he is not afraid, but often checks the restaurant
dining room around him for eavesdroppers.
   ``The old leaders are all still there. Only the moment they
start falling, can we begin making real changes,'' he said.
   The state news agency BTA reported today that Zhivkov was
arrested and charged with malfeasance in office, among other
charges.
   According to leading opposition figure Petar Beron, Zhivkov's
family and cronies also will likely be tried. But he said a
parliament-led commission investigating abuses of power during the
clique's 35-year rule would probably stop short of unearthing
evidence of corruption by other leading Communists who are ``very
much still at large.''
   Beron said Zhivkov was at his Boyana residence near Sofia, being
``protected from the wrath of the people.''
   Parliament on Monday struck the Communists' guaranteed leading
role in society from the constitution. East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary already have done so.
   But for the time being, the Balkan country still remains, at
least constitutionally, ``a socialist state ... headed by the
working class.'' Major steps toward democracy look far away in
Bulgaria.
   ``All our neighbor countries are ahead of us now,'' said Emil
Angelov, 21, a medical student fom Pravec. But he said he was
optimistic that ``time will take its course _ if we really have
free elections, (the Communists) will lose.''
   Opposition leaders are not so sure. Zhelio Zhelev, president of
the opposition Union of Democratic Forces, says his group might not
be prepared in time for the general elections Mladenov has pledged
for May.
   Claiming the state-controlled media is still biased toward the
Communists, Zhelev has called for two-stage elections, with a vote
in May to eject close Zhivkov associates from Parliament followed
by a full election in November.
   ``People feel freer, and we're trying for change, but all we've
had up to now is the nationalities problem,'' said Angelov.
   Tensions flared between Bulgarian nationalists and the country's
estimated 1.5 million ethnic Turks and Moslems after the country's
new leaders on Dec. 29 reversed Zhivkov's harsh ethnic assimilation
policy, which banned the use of Turkish names and language and
Moslem religious rites.
   The decision sparked protests and strikes and brought about a
national debate that distracted attention from calls for swifter
political reform.
   Some opposition figures even have accused veteran local party
officials of inciting hatred among the nationalists in an attempt
to cling to power.
   ``It basically put our struggle for more democracy on ice and I
can't see the process speeding up that much in the near future,''
said Zhelev.
   Both Ogledalov and Angelov said the tensions have been used to
postpone painful decisions on Bulgaria's real problems _ its
one-party system and its tattered, centrally-planned economy.
   In Pravec, a few inhabitants laugh and joke about Zhivkov now.
But most are reluctant to talk about the man known familiarly as
``Toshko,'' whom Ogledalov remembers as ``jovial and hearty with a
good sense of humor and a good network of bodyguards.''
   Zhivkov made Pravec a Socialist showpiece, and its inhabitants
were often resented for their pretty homes, clean air and
well-stocked stores _ rarities in many Bulgarian towns.
   ``But we weren't privileged,'' said Ogledalov, ``Every month we
had to scrub every inch of the town with our own hands before
(Zhivkov) arrived.''

<BYLINE>Mazowiecki Urges Early Democratic Local Goverment Elections
^By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki asked
parliament today to move up this year's democratic elections for
local governments, the last bastion of Communist power in Poland.
   The radical economic and political reforms of the East bloc's
first government led by a non-Communist are being slowed by
resistance on the provincial and municipal level, and Mazowiecki
said the voting should be held in April.
   The elections had been expected in June or November, but
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Monday urged earlier balloting,
saying reforms were not being carried out quickly enough.
   ``The government's most important task next to leading the
nation out of economic collapse is the building of a strong and
stable democratic foundation for a democratic system,'' Mazowiecki
told the Sejm, the lower house of parliament.
   ``Until we create a real `self-government,' we will not defeat
the resistance that we meet while introducing reforms,'' he said.
   The lawmakers showed their approval of Mazowiecki's views with a
standing ovation.
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist president, looked on
from a gallery during Mazowiecki's 40-minute speech. Jaruzelski
agrees with the new election timetable, the pro-Solidrity Gazeta
Wyborcza newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Non-Communist candidates are expected to do well in the local
and provincial elections.
   Solidarity candidates won an overwhelming victory in the
partially free parliament elections in June, 1989 leading to
creation of the Solidarity-dominated government that ended four
decades of Communist control of Poland.
   On Jan. 1, the government began implementing reforms to create a
market-oriented economy and curb inflation.
   Mazowiecki praised Poland as a leader of East bloc reform and
``a stabile point on the European map.''
   ``Our society accepting with dignity and calmness the
difficulties connected with the repairing of the economy arouses
respect in many countries,'' he said.
   ``The course of our reform is giving stimulation to the changes
in other countries of the region. The failure of our efforts could
make more difficult the evolution occurring in Central and Eastern
Europe,'' he said.
   East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovkia, Bulgaria and Romania also
are carrying out political reforms following popular uprisings of
their own.
   Mazowiecki is to visit Czechoslovakia next week, and he urged
closer alliance with the new Prague government. ``In close
cooperation, our significance in Europe could be greater,'' he said.
   Polands' economic reforms include a tight wage policy as part of
the attack on inflation. Prices are soaring, however, because they
are no longer controlled by the government or kept artificially low
by budget subsidies.
   Finance Ministry officials say it will take at least six months
for prices to stabilize, and that the interim period will be
difficult for workers.
   More than 6,000 miners demanding higher pay struck for a third
day today at five mines in southern Poland, the official PAP news
agency reported.
   The strikes are the first significant labor protest since the
government began implementing the reforms.
   None of the mines currently on strike participated in the August
1988 protests that pushed then former Communist government to begin
talks on political reform with the Solidarity-led opposition.
   The Solidarity trade union will open a six-day national congress
on April 19, its first since before the 1981 martial law crackdown.
   Debate over the government's economic policy and possibly even
Walesa's leadership can be expected during the congress, to be held
in Gdansk where the union was born during an August 1980 Lenin
shipyard strike.
   The Communist Party, which is struggling to maintain a role in
Poland, will open a congress Jan. 27 and is expected to vote to
form a new party based on the social democratic model, with a new
name and a redefined program.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's top opposition group met with
government officials today for the first time since demonstrators
stormed secret police headquarters and said the nation's revolution
must remain peaceful.
   The negotiators backed a resolution calling for all guns,
grenades and other weapons belonging to the secret police to be
turned over to the Interior Ministry by Jan. 31.
   They also proposed that the government nullify former Communist
Party chief Egon Krenz's oath of secrecy, thus requiring him to
give a complete account of secret police functions when he appears
before the next session of talks Monday.
   Krenz cited the oath during earlier testimony before a
commission investigating police brutality during demonstrations in
October in East Berlin.
   At the start of today's session, the eighth between opposition
groups and the government, New Forum issued a statement repeating
the organization's ``insistence on a peaceful revolution.''
   The government blamed New Forum, the largest opposition
organization, for the rampage Monday of secret police headquarters
in East Berlin. New Forum organized the protest outside the
building but said it was to be peaceful, and it denied
responsibility for the rampage.
   ``Even one hour of property damage is too much,'' it said.
   New Forum demanded to know who had opened the door to the
complex to allow protesters inside. Many East Germans have said
they suspect government infiltrators instigated the rampage to
weaken the opposition before elections May 6.
   The 16 opposition groups, political parties and the Communists
represented at the negotiations joined in a call for protesters to
reject any violence in future protests.
   The demonstration Monday was to oppose the ``Stasi,'' or secret
police, who under former hard-line leaders used strong-arm methods
to suppress dissent. Premier Hans Modrow has promised the secret
police agency will be completely dismantled by June.
   Krenz, who resigned in early December, on Wednesday faced a
commission of the East Berlin city government that is investigating
police violence during massive street protests Oct. 6 and 7.
   The protests coincided with the visit of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and were a turning point that led to the
ouster of hard-line leader Erich Honecker 10 days later.
   Krenz said he accepted ``joint responsibility for falsely
estimating dissident citizens and dissident groups for years.''
   ``From today's viewpoint, that is incomprehensible,'' said
Krenz, who succeeded Honecker and was himself ousted six weeks
later.
   Krenz, whose appearance before the commission was broadcast on
East German television, also said that the former ruling Politburo
had failed to consider ``negative developments in society.''
   Beginning last summer, tens of thousands of East Germans began
to flee the country, while at the same time pressure built from
those staying at home.
   Another former Politburo member, Guenter Schabowski, told the
commission that Honecker, working closely with then secret police
chief Erich Mielke, had personally ordered the attacks on the
protesters.
   ``Honecker took things into his own hands,'' Schabowski told the
panel.
   The panel members are investigating possible criminal charges
against the ousted leaders. Honecker and Mielke are targeted for an
indictment for high treason. No formal criminal investigation of
Krenz has been announced.

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev faces an
unstable situation in his country, but he will likely remain in
power because few of his colleagues have an alternative program,
says veteran diplomat George F. Kennan.
   Kennan, 86, said economic difficulties in the Soviet Union along
with ethnic unheaval have ``created a situation of great difficulty
and danger for Gorbachev, who is viewed as personally responsible
for all these crises and difficulties.''
   Kennan, a former ambassador to the Soviet Union and a professor
emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, N.J.,
made his comments Wednesday in an appearance before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.
   So great are Gorbachev's problems that it is unlikely he could
have remained in office for so long had he not attained such
international prestige, an important asset for the Soviet Union,
Kennan said.
   Moreover, Kennan said, none of Gorbachev's senior colleagues has
``any program to offer as an alternative to the one he has created
and carried forward.''
   Kennan said it is in the interests of the United States to see
that Gorbachev stays in power as he moves to ease Cold War tensions.
   To that end, Washington should consider suspending trade
restrictions such as the Jackson-Vanik amendment that denies Most
Favored Nation trade status and export credits to the Soviet Union
and most other communist nations that restricted the right of their
citizens to emigrate, he said.
   On a related issue, The Washington Post reported that President
Bush plans to lift the Jackson-Vanik restrictions from
Czechoslovakia.
   Kennan also said the United States could take a ``more
forthcoming attitude'' on negotiations to reduce conventional arms
in Europe, and should consult regularly with Moscow about questions
arising from the ``momentous changes'' in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Hungary Steps Up Demand for Soviet Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary today stepped up its demand for a
quick withdrawal of Soviet troops from its soil and made a surprise
proposal for sharp cuts in all foreign troops stationed in Europe.
   Ferenc Somogyi, state secretary of the Hungarian Foreign
Ministry, made the proposals as part of East-West talks on reducing
conventional armed forces in Europe.
   His plan goes well beyond the manpower limits suggested by
President Bush in the negotiations between the 16 nations of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven countries of the
Warsaw Pact.
   Hungary has previously called for the Kremlin to remove its
troops, but Somogyi modified the demand by saying his nation wanted
the soldiers out this year or next year at the latest.
   ``There are no reasons be it of political, military security or
arms-control character that would justify the stationing of foreign
troops on the territory of Hungary,'' he told a news conference.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth recently met with Soviet Premier
Nikolai Ryzhkov to arrange talks on the issue.
   Nemeth had stressed that withdrawal depended on an agreement at
the Vienna talks on cutting conventional, or non-nuclear, forces in
Europe.
   Czechoslovakia also wants all Soviet soldiers out this year.
   About 10,000 Soviet troops already have left Hungary and
Czechoslovakia under the phased withdrawal of 50,000 men from
Eastern Europe. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced
that withdrawal in December 1988.
   An additional 6,000 of the 52,000 Soviet troops said to remain
in Hungary are due to leave this year, and an undisclosed number
are scheduled to leave Czechoslovakia, where officials say there
are 70,000 Soviet forces.
   Somogyi told reporters that his proposal for East-West troop
cuts does not set a ceiling on the number of foreign soldiers that
could be stationed in another country in Europe.
   But, he said, the overall foreign troop deployment in Europe
should be much lower than Bush's proposal calling for the United
States and the Soviet Union to pare their forces in Europe to no
more than 275,000 each.
   To meet the Bush proposal, the Soviets would have to pull out
300,000 troops and the United States 30,000.
   Somogyi said his plan would apply to troops of all countries,
not just the superpowers. The Soviet Union has been talking about a
limit of 300,000 to 350,000 troops stationed abroad by each
alliance.
   As Somogyi spoke, top military officers from 35 nations met for
a third day to discuss East-West military strategies. The
three-week meeting is part of negotiations designed to reduce
military tensions in Europe.
   On Wednesday, military officers of Czechoslovakia, Poland and
East Germany who are attending that meeting emphasized their
governments' defense concerns rather than those of the Warsaw Pact.
   The shift reflects the political changes that have swept the
East bloc and the emerging individuality of nations.
   ``We proceed from the fact that our national interests are
fundamental,'' said Gen. Anton Slimak, chief of Czechoslovakia's
general staff.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said some East-bloc governments seemed to be making ``unilateral
judgments'' on the structure of their armed forces.
   ``Yet they continue to say they are part of an alliance. So I
think the Warsaw Pact alliance is shifting in its character to a
more political institution,'' he told a news conference.
   No country gave any indication in private talks that it was
thinking of leaving the alliance, Powell said.

   Three men with alleged mob ties were charged
with running a $335 million-a-year sports betting network that used
a nationwide toll-free number and fax machines to accept wagers,
police said.
   Alleged kingpin Alfred Mart, 72, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and
40 other people were arrested on felony gambling charges during
raids Tuesday and over the weekend in New York City, Point
Pleasant, N.J., and Florida. Mart also was charged with
racketeering, said New York police Inspector Frank Biehler.
   Biehler gave details of the case at a news conference Wednesday
where investigators displayed a duffle bag containing gambling
records and $1 million in $100 bills. Investigators also seized
$700,000 in cash from three safe-deposit boxes, and froze $300,000
in deposits at New York City banks.
   The raids were timed for the heightened gambling during the
National Football League playoff games, which took place last
weekend, Biehler said.
   Mart's alleged chief lieutenants in New York were identified as
Joseph Yedbovnick, 70, and Martin McDarby, 65, both of the New York
borough of Queens. They were charged with felony gambling.
   All three were identified as associates with the Genovese crime
family, Biehler said.
   ``We believe Yedbovnick and McDarby are `bookmaker's
bookmakers.' They would not in our opinion accept anything that
would be termed a small wager,'' Biehler said.
   Gambling records seized during the raids revealed numerous
wagers of $25,000 to $50,000 and indicated the ring was doing $335
million worth of business a year, the inspector said.
   He said the ring laundered money through a check-cashing service
in Florida, and instructed losing bettors to wire their money in
amounts smaller than $10,000, to circumvent a federal law that
requires information about checks over that amount.
   Biehler said the ring passed itself off as a legitimate business
to obtain the toll-free number.
   ``Fax machines and WATS lines and toll-free numbers are not
unknown in a lot of forms of criminality. As technology increases,
the criminals certainly take advantage of it too,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Plans to Mothball Battleships Iowa and New Jersey, Official
Says</HEAD>

   The Navy plans to mothball the battleships
Iowa and New Jersey in a money-saving move that would leave only
two active battleships, a Defense Department official says.
   The Iowa, which was damaged in the April 19 explosion that
killed 47 sailors, would be repaired before being mothballed, the
official said Wednesday night.
   ``It's as good as done,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But he conceded that political pressure from New York City,
where the Navy had planned to base the Iowa, could cause another
ship to ``be thrown into the pot'' to replace that one at that new
base, now about 70 percent complete.
   It had been known previously the Navy would seek to mothball two
battleships, but it was not known which two would be chosen. If the
mothball plan is carried out, the Navy would retain one battleship,
the Wisconsin, in the Atlantic Fleet, and one in the Pacific Fleet,
the Missouri.
   Figures on how much the Navy expects to save by mothballing the
ships were not immediately available.
   The Iowa explosion occurred when the middle 16-inch gun in the
battleship's three-gun No. 2 turret exploded during firing practice
in the Atlantic.
   The Navy has said the explosion was most probably the work of a
member of the gun crew trying to commit suicide, a conclusion
strongly opposed as unsupported by many members of Congress.
   Meanwhile, the Iowa's commanding officer, Capt. Fred J.
Moosally, on Wednesday announced plans to retire after 24 years of
Navy service. Moosally had received a non-punitive letter of
caution last fall for ``administrative deficiencies'' aboard the
ship but it was not made part of his permanent file.
   Moosally said of his reason for retiring: ``There's a lot of
things, but I'm not going to get into specifics. I thought about
staying in. That was an option.''
   The Iowa entered the Norfolk, Va., Navy Yard earlier in the week
for a 14-week refit that will cost $26 million and restore the
crippled turret to full operation.
   In addition to the structural, electrical and equipment repairs
needed in the turret, the Navy also plans to overhaul pumps,
freshwater and saltwater piping, gunfire-control equipment,
electronic equipment and steam, fuel and water valves.
   Under a plan to disperse the battleships, attacked by critics as
pure pork-barrel politics, the Navy planned to base the Iowa and
its four or five smaller escorting frigates and destroyers at a new
base on Staten Island in New York City, and the New Jersey at Long
Beach, Calif.
   The official gave no indication what would happen to the
facilities lined up for the home ports. Commenting earlier this
week on the possibility that the Iowa would be mothballed, Guy
Molinari, borough president of Staten Island who has just resigned
as the area's Republican congressman, said, ``It is my educated
guess ... that we probably will not have the Iowa but we will have
a surface action group coming to Staten Island and it will be a
different configuration of vessels.''
   Current plans call for the Wisconsin to be based at Corpus
Christi, Texas, and the Missouri's group of ships to be split
between Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and Long Beach.
   The New Jersey and the Iowa are the two older ships, launched
during World War II in 1942 and entering service the following
year. All four ships saw action in that war, served through the
Korean War years and were mothballed in the 1950s.
   The four ships were brought out of mothballs starting in 1982,
despite criticisms that they would be extravagantly expensive to
operate because of the large crews needed _ 65 officers and 1,453
enlisted men each.
   If the New Jersey, which fired at targets in Lebanon in 1982, is
returned to the inactive fleet, it will be for the third time. The
ship also was used and deactivated during the Vietnam war.
   The ships are 887 feet long and displace 58,000 tons. In
addition to 16-inch guns, they carry Tomahawk cruise missiles,
Harpoon anti-ship missiles, 12 5-inch guns and four rapid-firing
20mm anti-aircraft guns for close-in defense.

   After two kids and 12 years together, Jerry Hall
said today that she and Rolling Stone Mick Jagger will get married.
   She didn't say when _ but neither did Jagger when he announced,
in 1983, that they would be tying the knot ``any day now.''
   ``For the first time, we both think marriage is a good thing,''
Ms. Hall told reporters at the Lyric Theater, where she will be
starring in ``Bus Stop,'' with singer Shaun Cassidy.
   The Texas-born model and actress refused to confirm that her
large diamond ring was an engagement present from the rock singer,
who is in the Caribbean.
   ``He gives me a ring like this about once a year,'' she said.
   Hall and Jagger have two children: Elizabeth Scarlett, 5, and
Leroy Augustine, 3.
   Ms. Hall appeared in ``Bus Stop'' in 1988 in New Jersey, and the
British production will open next week in suburban Watford before
moving to London in February.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Defends Statement on Settling Occupied Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today defended
his statement that Israel must hold onto the occupied territories
to settle large numbers of Soviet Jewish immigrants.
   The United States criticized the statement Sunday, but Shamir
said it overreacted.
   Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, said the statement
was in line with his belief that Israel should never return the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange for peace with Arab
neighbors.
   ``Everyone knows what my positions and the positions of the
Likud are concerning the future of Israel,'' he said in an
interview with Israel radio.
   A peace settlement with the Arabs should not contain a
territorial compromise, Shamir said. ``The country is very small.
No new division can solve problems. It will just create problems,''
he said.
   In a speech Sunday, Shamir said Israel needs the occupied lands
to settle an influx of Soviet Jews.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler termed
Shamir's suggestion ``not helpful.''
   ``We do not think that building settlements or putting even more
settlers in the territories promotes the cause of peace,'' Mrs.
Tutwiler said in Washington.
   Asked whether his statement provided ammunition to Arab leaders
seeking to pressure the Soviet Union to halt Jewish emigration,
Shamir said: ``Arabs oppose all immigration, regardless of what has
been said or not been said. For them, the immigration of Soviet
Jews to Israel in large numbers is a sign of defeat ... in their
war against the state of Israel and Zionism.''
   Moslem fundamentalists in the occupied lands today distributed
leaflets urging Palestinians to increase resistance to Israeli rule
to protest the arrival of Soviet Jews.
   ``Palestine is screaming,'' said the leaflet circulated by the
Hamas, or Zeal, movement. ``America supports the Jewish state with
money and weapons, and Russia is feeding Israel with people and
experts. So where are the Moslems?''
   Fewer than 100,000 Israelis have settled among some 1.7 million
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   As many as 100,000 Soviet Jews are expected to come to Israel
this year.
   Jordan's King Hussein expressed alarm over Shamir's statement in
an interview published today.
   ``Who will these thousands of immigrants replace, and what will
happen to those who will be replaced by these new arrivals?''
Hussein told the Jordan Times newspaper.
   He indicated the settlement of immigrants could lead to mass
expulsions of Palestinians to Jordan, which Israeli extremists
argue is already a Palestinian state.
   Shamir today also criticized as ``very harmful'' a proposal by
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who said a 5 percent cut in U.S.
aid to big recipients such as Israel would free funds to help
fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe and Latin America.
   Israel receives $3 billion a year from the United States, more
than any other country.
   Shamir said the Dole proposal comes at a time when Israel is
seeking more aid from the United States to help in the absorption
of Soviet immigrants.
   He said he did not believe the Dole statement was intended to
press Israel to make concessions in Middle East peace efforts. The
process is deadlocked because of Israel's insistence on written
U.S. guarantees that the PLO be kept out of peace talks.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has threatened to resign if the
U.S.-brokered peace efforts fail.
   In an interview published today, he said the problem is a result
of Washington coddling Israel, and he said Arabs should use oil as
a weapon to force concessions from the United States.
   Arafat told the magazine Al-Mussawar he will announce his
resignation if the peace efforts reach a dead end.

   Harlem should be declared a health disaster
area, according to a doctor whose study found that a man in Harlem
has a worse chance of living past age 40 than one in
poverty-stricken Bangladesh.
   ``We have a chronic disaster area right in front of our eyes
that most people are not aware of,'' said Dr. Harold P. Freeman,
director of surgery at Harlem Hospital.
   The report published in today's New England Journal of Medicine
was compiled by Freeman, 56, and Dr. Colin McCord, 61, who worked
in Bangladesh between 1972 and 1980 and noticed after returning to
the United States that the mortality rates were worse in Harlem.
   The doctors reviewed records from 1979 to 1981 and found that
the death rate among men under 65 in Harlem was the highest in New
York and almost three times that of white U.S. men under 65.
   ``It's a national disaster and a national disgrace,'' said
McCord, attending surgeon at Harlem Hospital.
   McCord said no formal study has been done through the 1980s, but
a review of records from 1980 to 1987 shows deaths continued to
increase with the onset of AIDS, crack, homelessness and increased
use of illegal drugs.
   He said that during the seven-year stretch, deaths among those
25 to 45 years old rose 35 percent in Harlem.
   The findings of the formal study based on 1979 to 1981 figures
stem from an analysis of New York's central Harlem health district,
where 96 percent of the population is black and 41 percent live
below the poverty line.
   The researchers found that 2,095 men under 65 died in Harlem
from 1979 to 1981. If the death rate in Harlem had been the same as
for white men under 65 across the United States, the number of
deaths would have been only a little more than one-third as high _
720. Among all Harlem residents, the death rate was more than 50
percent higher than the death rate for all U.S. whites, the
researchers found.
   To dramatize their figures, the researchers compared them with
Bangladesh. By age 40, the life expectancy of men in Bangladesh
begins to exceed that of Harlem men. In Bangladesh, 55 percent of
men and 50 percent of women live to age 65. In Harlem, 40 percent
of men and 65 percent of women live that long.
   Freeman said the five-year survival rate of women who learn they
have cancer in Harlem is 32 percent, but it is 75 percent for white
women elsewhere in America.
   He blamed the results on lack of education, poor access to
health care, substandard housing, isolation, alienation, a tendency
to live day to day and malnutrition.
   Reacting to the study, a spokeman for Mayor David Dinkins said
the city, already financially strapped, needs federal help after
years of reduced health care during President Reagan's
administration.
   ``Our hope would be in a kindler, gentler world that there'd be
a greater federal involvement in financing the health system,'' Lee
Jones said.

   Someone apparently bent on taking the
wind out of a police crackdown on speeders has been puncturing
tires on patrol cars and motorcycles by sprinkling the officers'
highway hideaways with roofing nails.
   Since May, more than 40 tires on patrol cars and motorcycles
have been flattened by the roofing nails, authorities said
Wednesday.
   After it happened more than once, Westminster police figured
they were targets of booby-traps placed by someone who knew just
where officers would park while looking for speeders.
   ``It was just too coincidental,'' said police spokesman Rick
Kempsell.
   The latest incident occurred Wednesday on a ramp leading to
westbound U.S. 36. Two tires on a police car were punctured. Police
estimated 300 to 500 of the small nails were scattered along the
ramp's shoulder, less than a quarter mile from police headquarters.
   Roofing nails also have been found scattered near emergency
vehicle turnaround areas along the turnpike and Interstate 25.
   The three-quarter-inch mails have flattened at least 30 patrol
car tires and ruined at least a dozen police motorcycle tires since
May. Car tires can be repaired, but the motorcycle tires must be
replaced at a cost of $127 apiece.
   Police said there's no way to know how many passing motorists
also have had tires flattened by the nails.

   The mayor of Nagasaki, the target of death threats
since he said Emperor Hirohito bore some responsibility for World
War II, was shot and wounded today. Police said they arrested the
leader of a rightist group.
   The 67-year-old mayor, Hitoshi Motoshima, was rushed to surgery
at Nagasaki Public Hospital after being shot in the back outside
Nagasaki's City Hall. Doctors told Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK)
television a bullet pierced his left lung, but he was not in
serious condition.
   About five hours after the attack, police said they had arrested
a man who confessed to shooting the mayor. Police identified him as
Kazumi Tajiri, 40, of Tokyo, and said he was arrested at a hotel in
Nagasaki, a city 600 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   A police spokesman described Tajiri as the leader of a rightist
group called Sane Thinkers' School.
   Rightist groups in Japan venerate the imperial family and are
strongly anti-Communist. They draw much of their inspiration from
the militarism that prevailed before World War II.
   The police official said the Sane Thinkers' School has about 30
members in Nagasaki, more than any other rightist group in the
city. It was established nine years ago, and some members have been
arrested in the past for shooting at a district court judge and for
other crimes, said the police official.
   City spokesman Megumi Nobeta said the mayor was shot as he was
about to get into his car. The attack left a pool of blood in the
street beside the car.
   The Kyodo News Service quoted witnesses as saying the gunman, a
slim man wearing a dark brown suit, came out of City Hall and shot
Motoshima at close range.
   Television showed Tajiri after he was arrested, and then
broadcast a video of a 1987 interview in which Tajiri condoned
terrorism.
   Asked in the 1987 interview if he would kill somebody he hated,
Tajiri responded, ``Yes, because after all, right-wingers are
terrorists.'' The comments were made after a 1987 shooting in which
a reporter for a liberal-leaning newspaper was killed.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama said today's shooting
was ``an extremely cruel crime, and it will have a strong impact on
society.''
   It was the first time a politician had been shot in Japan since
World War II, National Police Agency records showed. But the
records showed 25 previous attacks on key politicians by rightists
using knives, swords, explosives or fists, the agency said.
   Such attacks, while not common, give credence to threats by
rightist groups. The most dramatic was in 1960 when a right-wing
student, in an assault at a Socialist Party rally that was being
televised, stabbed party chairman Inejiro Asanuma to death on stage.
   Motoshima has been receiving threats from ultra-nationalists and
others since December 1988, when he said at a city assembly session
he believed Hirohito, then on his deathbed, ``shares responsibility
for the war, as well as all of us who lived in that period.''
   Motoshima said Hirohito could have ended World War II sooner and
perhaps spared Nagasaki from the atomic bomb. Nagasaki was hit by
an atomic bomb Aug. 9, 1945, three days after Hiroshima became the
first city to be hit by a nuclear weapon.
   The mayor's comments enraged fringe groups that reject any
criticism of the imperial family, and Motoshima continued to
receive threats even after Hirohito's death one year ago.
   In December, a right-wing doctor, 62-year-old Shigeru Kajiyama,
was sentenced to two years in prison for threatening to kill the
mayor. Testimony at his trial said he had sent three anonymous
letters containing live bullets to the mayor.
   In January 1989, a rightist was arrested after breaking into
City Hall with a knife intending to force Motoshima into retracting
his statement.
   Early last year, rightists mobilized about 100 sound trucks to
circle City Hall and blare slogans denouncing the mayor. Police at
one time had about 1,200 officers deployed to prevent trouble in
the city.
   NHK reported that police had relaxed their special guard on
Motoshima at the end of 1989 and no longer had officers following
him when he was outside his office or home.
   Though the rightists made a great deal of noise, supporters of
the mayor's position sent him a petition with some 286,000
signatures in April calling for more freedom to express opinions,
even on taboo subjects such as the late emperor's war responsiblity.
   While many scholars believe Hirohito was a figurehead and the
militarists made all important decisions during the war, the
emperor was the nominal commander in chief and approved key
decisions. Critics say Hirohito could have ended the war sooner,
but during his life the late emperor never gave much detail on his
role during the war.
   Motoshima was an independent supported by the long-governing
Liberal Democratic Party, but his remarks on the emperor estranged
him from the Liberal Democrats, who sent a delegation demanding he
retract his opinion. He refused.

<HEAD>Judge Drops Defamation Countersuit in Cincinnati Wiretap Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed a lawsuit against the phone
company by two former installers who say they were ordered to
perform 1,200 wiretaps, but also made it tougher for the company to
win its defamation case against the two men.
   Hamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Fred J. Cartolano on
Wednesday declared all the participants in the case public figures,
which raises the standard of proof necessary for the jury to find
defamation occurred.
   Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co., its parent, Cincinnati Bell Inc.,
and phone company managers James West and Peter Gabor accused
Leonard Gates and Robert Draise of defamation for saying they were
ordered to perform 1,200 wiretaps between 1972 and 1984.
   Gates and Draise, claiming they were injured because Bell
officials called them liars, countersued. The judge dismissed the
countersuit, ruling Wednesday that Gates and Draise failed to prove
they were injured based on their status as public figures.
   The trial on the suit and countersuit has been going on for
seven weeks. Closing arguments on the remaining issues were
expected to begin today.
   The law says a public figure must prove he was libeled through a
reckless or malicious disregard of the truth. A private figure must
show only that an allegation was untrue, and that the person making
it was careless in finding out whether it was the truth.
   Draise and Gates became public figures ``by injecting themselves
into a public controversy,'' Cartolano said. ``They said they
intentionally used the press to get their story out.''
   Bell also qualifies as a public figure, Cartolano said. To rule
otherwise ``would have a chilling effect on the community,''
because people would be afraid to criticize the company, he said.
   West and Gabor are public figures ``as agents of their
employer'' and because they participated in a news conference Bell
held last year in an attempt to refute Gates' and Draise's charges,
Cartolano said.
   Bell contends Gates and Draise lied to get revenge against the
company because they were fired for other reasons. Gates was fired
in 1986, and Draise in 1979.
   Gates and Draise said they started doing the wiretaps for
members of the Cincinnati police intelligence squad about 1972 and
a few years later began getting their orders from West and Gabor.
   The taps originally were done on suspected criminals, but later
included judges, lawyers, business and political leaders, police
and journalists, according to Gates and Draise.
   Several former members of the police intelligence squad have
admitted using Gates and Draise to do illegal taps in the early
1970s. But Bell, West and Gabor deny any knowledge of the activity.

   A man accused of trying to hijack an
America West airplane to Cuba told a federal magistrate that he
wanted to apologize to passengers and to the stewardess he's
charged with assaulting.
   ``They were never in any danger,'' Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez
told U.S. Magistrate Stephen Capelle at his arraignment Wednesday.
``I took this course out of desperation.''
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 39, of New Orleans, was charged with aircraft
piracy and assaulting stewardess Stacey Wood in Tuesday night's
incident aboard Flight 727 from Houston to Las Vegas, carrying 34
passengers and five crew members.
   Passengers said he grabbed Ms. Wood, announced he had a bomb and
demanded to go to Cuba. The pilot landed the Boeing 737 in Austin,
saying he had to refuel to make it to Cuba.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez, a native of Cuba, said he came to the United
States when he was 11 years old. He said he was not a U.S. citizen.
   After the plain landed at Austin's Robert Mueller Municipal
Airport, Gonzalez-Gonzalez allowed the passengers and three of the
crew members to leave the plane. He was apprehended by a police
officer who climbed up an emergency chute and overpowered him,
police said. No bomb was found.
   ``The facts speak for themselves. I'm guilty as charged,''
Gonzalez-Gonzalez told Capelle. ``My intention was to leave this
country. I was being chased with constant threat of being
murdered.''
   He said someone wanted to silence him for things he knew, but
did not elaborate. A criminal complaint, signed by FBI agent James
Echols, said Gonzalez-Gonzalez told another FBI agent he thought
U.S. authorities were hunting him.
   If convicted of the air piracy charge, he faces 20 years to life
in prison. The assault charge carries a maximum 10-year prison
term, Echols said.
   Capelle said he would appoint an attorney for Gonzalez-Gonzalez
and ordered him held pending a Jan. 25 detention and bond hearing.

   A fugitive convicted of sex abuse charges
was tripped up after police in another state arrested him on
charges of failing to pay child support and found a clipping
mentioning his ``most-wanted'' status in his pocket.
   Michigan state police arrested Curtis L. Howard, 45, in Detroit
on Jan. 8 on charges of not paying child support. When they
searched his pockets, they found he had been convicted for sexually
attacking a 12-year-old girl and was on the Onondaga County
Sheriff's Department list of 10 most wanted felons.
   Detective Ed Carravallah of the Wayne County Sheriff's
Department in Michigan said he isn't sure why Howard carried a
clipping indicating he was a fugitive.
   ``Maybe that was his 15 minutes of fame,'' Carravallah said.
   He said they didn't bother to file the child support charges.
   Howard was brought to Syracuse from Michigan on Wednesday by
investigators with the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department,
according to department spokesman Robert Burns.
   Burns said Howard would appear before County Judge William Burke
for sentencing on his April 1988 conviction of two counts of
first-degree sexual abuse and three counts of endangering the
welfare of a child. Howard fled before he could be sentenced, Burns
said.
   Each of the first-degree counts is punishable by a maximum term
of seven years in prison, Burns said.
   Howard carried a New York state driver's license, but told
police he was a Detroit resident.

<HEAD>Aoun Bans West Beirut Papers in Christian Enclave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maverick Gen. Michel Aoun today stepped
up his drive to gag the press by banning papers published in Moslem
west Beirut from newsstands in the Christian enclave after they
defied his orders.
   Aoun's troops prevented a truck carrying copies of the
French-language L'Orient-Le Jour from entering the Christian sector.
   The daily did not heed a directive Aoun issued Tuesday banning
the media from referring to Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi as
head of state.
   An official of the Lebanese Distribution Co., which delivers the
newspaper to newsstands in the Christian enclave, said a captain of
Aoun's army told the truck driver, ``L'Orient-Le Jour is banned for
not abiding by the general's directives.''
   The distribution official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
quoted the captain as saying: ``You call Hrawi president, so go and
sell the paper in Hrawi's territory.''
   L'Orient-Le Jour and An-Nahar, the nation's most prestigious
daily, were the only two papers based in west Beirut that Aoun had
allowed to be sold in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
northeast of the capital.
   An-Nahar has not been publishing since Wednesday morning in
protest of Aoun's order.
   Aoun's directive said Hrawi should only be referred to as a
former parliamentary deputy, noting that Aoun had declared
parliament dissolved to prevent the election of a Syrian-backed
head of state in November. He also ordered the media to stop
referring to Salim Hoss as prime minister.
   Hrawi was elected president under an Arab League peace plan to
end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, which has killed more than
150,000.
   Hrawi immediately dismissed Aoun as prime minister and army
commander, but the defiant general held out in the Christian
enclave, refusing to leave the presidential palace.
   Aoun opposes the peace plan because it does not call for the
immediate withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   The Phalangist Voice of Lebanon radio and the Voice of Free
Lebanon, owned by the Lebanese Forces Christian militia, maintained
a newscast strike for a third day to protest Aoun's directive. The
Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., the television station of the Lebanese
Forces, did not broadcast news Wednesday evening for a second day.
   The conservative newspaper Ad-Diyar, the leading daily in the
Christian enclave, has been the only publication to defy Aoun. It
was missing from newsstands today, a day after the prosecutor
general in Aoun's area of influence ordered it to stop publishing
for a week.
   Police ringed Ad-Diyar's offices in Beirut's Christian district
of Hazmiyeh Wednesday evening, delivered a subpoena to
publisher-editor Charles Ayoub. The police then withdrew.
   Prosecutor-General George Ghanem said he has started legal
proceedings against Ayoub on a charge of ``infringement on national
sovereignty,'' punishable by up to five years in prison.
   Ayoub told The Associated Press by telephone Wednesday that he
was subpoenaed to appear before a military examining magistrate
within 48 hours.
   An editorial that appeared Wednesday on Ad-Diyar's front page
said that following Aoun's directive would mean ``suffocation ...
it is a serious beginning to limiting the freedom of the press.''
   The leftist newspaper As-Safir, which operates from west Beirut,
said Aoun's news ban was the ``first step in a series of measures
that the general wants to apply. He'll partition the unions, the
economy and everything in Lebanon.''
   The Syndicate of Newspaper Publishers under Mohammed Baalbaki, a
Sunni Moslem, called for a day of solidarity with the press in
Lebanon on Saturday and urged all Lebanese to express their
rejection of ``police rules.''

   An increase in respiratory diseases,
particularly the flu, has forced the brief closings of emergency
rooms at three District of Columbia hospitals in the past week,
officials say.
   ``This is a problem that we are having throughout the city that
for reasons that are related to the flu, to pneumonia, to an
increased number of persons who are asthmatic and perhaps other
factors which we are not completely aware of yet,'' Dr. Reed
Tuckson, the District health commissioner, said Wednesday. The
outbreak is the worst in several years, he added.
   Providence Hospital closed its emergency rooms Wednesday night
and remained closed today because the 358-bed facility was swamped
with patients, particularly the elderly, complaining of respiratory
ailments, officials there said.
   ``We're almost always very crowded, especially January and
February because people are generally sicker,'' said Terry Harnett,
spokeswoman for Providence Hospital. ``Plus we are in a
neighborhood with a high concentration of elderly.''
   The emergency room of D.C. General Hospital, the city's public
hospital, shut down from Tuesday evening until about 8 a.m.
Wednesday morning because of shortage of beds for additional
patients, Tuckson said.
   Over the weekend, Providence Hospital and Capitol Hill Hospital
emergency rooms were closed for short periods.
   Tuckson said Washington hospital officials agreed Saturday on
joint action to deal with the influx of patients. The health
commissioner maintained that patients are being treated and the
brief closings are not leaving ``the city in trouble.''

   A postman who injured his shoulder when he
knocked down a door and rescued two children from a burning
building was reprimanded for a lapse in ``safe work practices'' _
but his boss says it was all a mistake.
   ``I got a letter chewing me out for getting hurt on the job,''
said Lodi postman Raymond Kaulfers, 49.
   But the reprimand was a mistake, Postmaster William B. Thomas
acknowledged today. He said the wrong form letter had been sent to
Kaulfers after the Dec. 26 rescue.
   Thomas, who oversees most post offices in Bergen and Passaic
counties, said the U.S. Postal Service sent Kaulfers a letter of
apology Wednesday.
   ``We begged his forgiveness and sent him an achievers' pin
indicating he behaved in the highest standard of the Postal
Service,'' Thomas said.
   The original letter said: ``It is my responsibility to provide
safe working conditions and to develop a safe work force. It is
your responsibility to adhere to safe work practices.''
   Kaulfers said he did ``what everybody else would have done'' in
rescuing the children.

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin boosted military units to wartime
strength in several regions and called up reservists in its
struggle to end ethnic strife in two southern republics, the
defense minister said today.
   The minister, Dmitri Yazov, called the Armenian-Azerbaijani
warfare, which has left at least 66 people dead and more than 200
wounded, ``a great disaster.''
   Most of the victims have been Armenians attacked by mobs in the
Azerbaijani capital, Baku. Terrorized Armenians were said to still
be fleeing by the thousands.
   Soviet troops ordered in Tuesday to enforce a state of emergency
have become caught up in the fighting, their efforts hampered by
defiant nationalists who set up blockades.
   Yazov told Soviet radio that ``in order to ensure order, we are
compelled to bring up to wartime strength'' some units in
neighboring regions. He did not say how many troops were being
called up or from where.
   The republic of Georgia, which has its own ethnic quarrels, and
the Russian federation are the areas nearest to Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   Moscow radio said some young men who recently completed
compulsory military service were being recalled.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today made his first public
comments on the civil strife between the Armenians, who are mainly
Christians, and the neighboring Azerbaijanis, who are predominately
Moslem.
   ``The problems which have been accumulating for tens, no, for
hundreds of years have erupted,'' he told a meeting in Moscow.
   ``We are now busy trying to halt this process, to prevent it
from going deeper and getting more acute,'' Gorbachev said in
comments broadcast on state-run radio. ``We have resorted to the
use of force against criminals, against this vandalism.''
   The Kremlin on Tuesday poured more than 11,000 additional troops
into the troubled region in a bid to quell the violence, the worst
since a decades-old feud over the land of Nagorno-Karabakh began
anew two years ago.
   The land is inside Azerbaijan but populated mainly by Armenians.
The Armenian republic wants to annex it.
   Soldiers were authorized Wednesday to fire on gunmen who attack
them or people who are trying to steal weapons. Yazov said their
numbers were still insufficient to bring the situation under
control.
   He said he understood reservists would be unhappy about being
called up to maintain order in another Soviet republic, but
emphasized that ``no one is setting them the task of killing,
shooting, going onto some offensive. It is principally to protect
public order.''
   However, soldiers' lives have been endangered. An Interior
Ministry lieutenant was shot and killed in Nagorno-Karabakh, and a
private was mortally wounded, according to official reports.
   Radio Moscow, detailing the difficulties facing units sent to
the Caucasus region, said Armenians seized one transport plane that
arrived with troops and demanded to be flown to safety.
   The capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, Stepanakert, lost two-thirds of
its water supply when saboteurs blew up parts of its water supply
pipe, Tass said today.
   The reservist call-up was needed in part because recent cuts
under Gorbachev's plan to slash the nation's armed forces have
depleted the pool of units that can be moved to the Caucasus, Yazov
said.
   He did not say how many of the newly mobilized troops would be
sent to the area of fighting.
   Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, in an interview printed today,
said internal security forces were already feeling the pinch of
trying to cope with the unrest while fulfilling their usual duties,
which include guarding prisons and fighting crime.
   In comments to the youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, Bakatin
referred to the strife as ``civil war,'' becoming the first
high-level member of the Soviet government to use those terms.
   Radio Moscow said anti-Armenian attacks continued in Baku, the
Azerbaijan capital. No new killings were reported in the city over
the past 24 hours, and 30 hostages held in one neighborhood were
set free.
   The latest violence exploded Saturday with bloody anti-Armenian
riots in Baku. That led to battles by bands of heavily armed
Armenians and Azerbaijanis in and near Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In Moscow, Interior Ministry spokesman Dmitri Seleznev said the
death toll was up to 66 and that 220 people had been wounded.
   He said 4,658 more Armenians had been evacuated from Baku since
Wednesday, adding to the 7,000 evacuated earlier in the week.
   There were 45 ``pogroms,'' or ethnically motivated attacks, in
the oil-producing center during the same period, and 26 people were
detained, said Seleznev, speaking in a telephone interview.
   He said pickets were up at two military airfields in Azerbaijan
and that attempts were made in Baku to block streets to obstruct
the progress of troops trying to restore order in the city of 1.7
million.
   Members of the Azerbaijani People's Front said today they warned
Moscow that if a curfew or martial law were imposed on Baku, they
would launch a general strike in the strategic oil center.
   In Armenia, Seleznev said, people continued attacks on armories
to steal firearms. Since Wednesday, 198 more weapons were seized
including four armored cars and one World War II-vintage T-34 tank,
which he said was towed away although it is not in working order.
   According to Soviet press reports and officials, the warring
sides have helicopters, armored vehicles, machine guns and other
arms seized from government arsenals or offered by compatriots.
   Many Armenian refugees streaming into Moscow blamed Gorbachev
personally for failing to halt the violence.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said much of the violence in
Baku involved Azerbaijani refugees from Armenia, who needed a place
to live and were forcing Armenians to leave their apartments.
Izvestia said tens of thousands of Azerbaijanis who fled ethnic
violence in Armenia in late 1988 remain without homes or jobs in
Baku.
   An Azerbaijani government spokesman today deplored the Baku
killings at a news conference in Moscow but cited the Azerbaijani
refugees' situation as a one cause.
   Zaur Rustam-Zade also said Armenian aggression against
Azerbaijani villages in Nagorno-Karabakh led to ``response
actions'' from Azerbaijanis, Tass said.
   In the Azerbaijani region of Nakhichevan, about 3,000 Armenians
blockaded the village of Kerki, defended by 30 residents who were
aided by 50 soldiers, Seleznev said. He said there had been
shooting but no deaths.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev dispelled
rumors that the borders with Iran and Turkey had been sealed.
   Iran's official Tehran radio said dozens of Azerbaijanis crossed
into Iran today from the Soviet Union, chanting Islamic slogans as
they arrived. The Soviet Azerbaijanis share the Moslem religion and
language with Iranians in that country's region of the same name.

   A moderate earthquake jolted the northern
California coastline early today, but no injuries or damage was
reported.
   The epicenter of the quake, which registered 5.1 on the Richter
scale, was at the juncture of the San Andreas and Mendocino faults,
about 30 miles northeast of Eureka, said Pat Jorgenson, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.
   She said the quake struck at 3:45 a.m.
   ``We didn't get any reports of injuries or damage,'' said a
dispatcher for the Eureka Police Department who declined to give
his name. ``We did feel it here. It was a big, strong jolt, not a
long, rumbling quake.''
   The temblor was the second quake of greater than 5.0 magnitude
to shake the region in less than 48 hours. A 5.3 quake struck about
50 miles south of Eureka Tuesday afternoon.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A quake with a reading of 5 can cause considerable
damage if it is centered in a populated area.

   Thousands of Filipinos today
protested a government plan to suspend a provincial governor linked
to last month's coup attempt, but the official later agreed to step
down.
   In Manila, a senior U.S. presidential adviser expressed strong
support today for President Corazon Aquino amid rumors of another
impending attempt to topple her government.
   The rumors have been sweeping Manila for weeks because many
leaders of the failed coup Dec. 1-9 remain at large.
   Late today, Rodolfo Aguinaldo, governor of the Cagayan province,
agreed to give up his post for 60 days while he is being
investigated for his alleged role in the failed coup.
   Aguinaldo will turn over his post Friday to his vice governor,
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said.
   Local Governments Secretary Luis Santos tried to serve the
suspension order to Aguinaldo earlier today in the provincial
capital of Tuguegarao, 200 miles north of Manila. But 5,000 people
confronted Santos' party, demanding that Aguinaldo be retained in
office.
   Aguinaldo, a former lieutenant colonel, said in a radio
interview Dec. 1 that he was sending tanks and artillery to Manila
to support the insurgents. The National Bureau of Investigation
says Aguinaldo's troops were turned back by loyal soldiers in
northern Luzon island.
   The government's ability to enforce the suspension is widely
seen here as an indicator of administration resolve to punish
participants in coup attempts.
   Aguinaldo was implicated but never charged in an August 1987
coup attempt. Afterward, he resigned from the military and raised
his own private army, ostensibly to fight Communist rebels.
   He was elected governor of Cagayan province by a landslide in
the January 1988 regional balloting.
   In Manila, Robert Gates, deputy U.S. national security adviser,
said President Bush sent him ``to express his personal support for
democracy and the constitutional process in the Philippines.''
   ``He authorized me to be able to give him a first-hand report on
developments here, and after I had a very good meeting with
President Aquino, I can do that,'' Gates told reporters. ``Among
other things, I would tell him that she is very confident.''
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Gates' visit indicated the United States ``very strongly'' supports
the Aquino government and noted that Bush ordered air support to
help put down the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt.
   At least 113 people were killed and more than 500 wounded in the
failed December coup, the sixth and bloodiest attempt to oust Mrs.
Aquino since she took power in the February 1986 uprising that
toppled the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   In announcing Gates' trip Wednesday, Fitzwater acknowledged
reports that military dissidents would try again to oust Mrs.
Aquino.
   ``There, of course, are continuing reports of problems in terms
of security forces and so forth,'' Fitzwater said. ``She is taking
measures to deal with those, to prevent future coups. We simply
want to consult with her on those efforts.''
   Gates, onetime deputy CIA director, is the chief deputy to Brent
Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser.
   During the December coup attempt, Gates was a key figure in
convening and running all-night meetings at the White House to
monitor developments and plan the U.S. response while Bush was
flying to Malta for talks with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov has
been placed under house arrest on charges of inciting ethnic
hostility, misuse of state property and malfeasance in office, the
state news agency reported today.
   The announcement came more than two months after the hard-line
party chief, who had ruled for 35 years, was ousted by a peaceful,
pro-democracy revolution and replaced by more moderate Communists
who have promised free elections and democratic reforms.
   Also today, sources said talks between the governing Communists
and the fledgling opposition on the transition to democracy were
suspended until at least Monday because of disagreements over
opposition demands for a voice on state radio and television. The
two delegations agreed to work out a compromise on the issue, said
Western diplomats on condition of anonymity.
   The leader of the Communist Party delegation, Andrei Loukanov,
said ``the revival of anti-Commmunism would be dangerous for the
transition to democracy,'' the official BTA news agency reported.
He did not elaborate but appeared to be referring to the
anti-Communist slogans at a rally Sunday by more than 50,000
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Zhivkov, 78, was charged with ``incitement of ethnic hostility
and hatred, with unwarranted receiving of excessive amounts of
public property and with gross malfeasance,'' the official BTA news
agency reported.
   It said a team of prosecutors has been assigned to conduct the
investigation and a warrant has been issued by the
prosecutor-general's office to ``remand'' Zhivkov in custody.
   BTA said Zhivkov was not jailed but ``remained under guard'' at
one of his residences, prevented from moving from the house.
Zhivkov reportedly had been under government protection at a house
near the capital, Sofia.
   It was unclear how far the proceedings against Zhivkov have
gone, and the date of the arrest warrant was not known.
   Immediately after his ouster, Zhivkov was accused of corrupt
practices in maintaining at least 30 holiday and hunting retreats
throughout the country.
   BTA said the investigation was launched on the basis of
materials supplied by a parliamentary commission of inquiry into
the ``abuses and breaches of the law committed in the state, public
and economic life by the previous regime.''
   Like other ousted hard-line leaders in Eastern Europe, Zhivkov
has been accused of abusing power by enriching himself at the
people's expense and damaging the economy through cumbersome
central planning.
   Zhivkov also has been accused of enforcing discrimination
against the country's ethnic Turkish minority.
   Today's announcement made clear Zhivkov is now officially held
responsible for the forced assimilation of the 1.2 million ethnic
Turks, who are mainly Moslem. Under the forced assimilation policy,
the ethnic Turks were forced to adopt ethnic Slavic names and their
language and religious rites were banned.
   Last summer, 320,000 ethnic Turks emigrated to Turkey, citing
unbearable living conditions under Zhivkov's harsh rule, but 80,000
later returned for lack of jobs and proper housing in Turkey.
   The new government overturned Zhivkov's assimilation policy on
Dec. 29.
   Petar Mladenov, a former minister under Zhivkov, replaced him as
Communist Party leader and promised reforms and free elections this
year.
   On Monday, Parliament repealed the Communist's guaranteed
monopoly on power, making Bulgaria the last Warsaw Pact country to
formally do so.
   The party is still powerful, however, and opposition groups
complain that it is not moving swiftly enough on reform.
   A wave of democratic reforms also has swept Poland, Hungary,
East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania, forcing out their
hard-line Communist leaders.
   Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania was convicted of ``grave crimes''
under his 24-year rule and executed Dec. 25, three days after his
ouster.
   The former East German leader, Erich Honecker, is under
investigation for high treason, abuse of power and corruption.
   In Czechoslovakia, former Communist Party chief Milos Jakes was
ousted on Nov. 24 and his fate is still unclear. A Communist Party
commission investigating abuse of political power ordered Jakes to
resign from the party.
   In Hungary, Janos Kadar was removed as party leader in 1988. He
died in July.
   Only Poland's Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski has managed to remain as
president under a government now controlled by non-Communists.

   Several rockets fired from south Lebanon
exploded today near the Israeli border but caused no damage or
injuries, the army said. It was the second such incident this week.
   The army said the Katyusha rockets landed in Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone, a strip of land in south Lebanon
that Israel carved out as a buffer against Palestinian and Shiite
Moslem guerrilla attacks.
   The army said artillery salvos were fired at the source of the
rockets, but it did not elaborate.
   The security zone is patrolled jointly by Israeli troops and
about 3,000 militiamen from the mostly Christian, Israeli-trained
South Lebanon Army.
   A number of Katyusha rockets landed in northern Israel on Sunday
but also caused no damage or injuries.

   Yasser Arafat today was quoted as saying he
will resign as the leader of the PLO if U.S.-brokered Middle East
peace efforts fail.
   Arafat blamed the current deadlock on U.S. ``pampering'' of
Israel and said the Arabs should use oil as a weapon to win
concessions from Washington.
   His comments appeared in the state-owned magazine Al-Mussawar.
``I have told the Arab League this week that if current peace
efforts reach a dead end and fail to solve our problem, I will call
a meeting of the Palestine National Council that elected me,''
Arafat was quoted as saying.
   ``I will tell them: `I am hereby returning the mandate you gave
me. Fend for yourselves, and the United States also should fend for
itself.' I will immediately announce my resignation.
   ``I will never be a toy in American hands.''
   The 450-member Palestine National Council, the Palestine
Liberation Organization's parliament-in-exile and its highest
policy-making body, named Arafat chairman in 1968. When it declared
a Palestinian state in 1988 on Arab land occupied by Israel, the
council proclaimed Arafat its president.
   Arafat said Washington's support of Israel is ``primarily
responsible for Israel's intransigence.''
   Israel currently is demanding U.S. guarantees that the PLO would
be excluded from Palestinian-Israeli talks that have been planned
for Cairo as a prelude to peace negotiations.
   Israel also wants to limit the agenda of the Cairo dialogue.
   The PLO insists on choosing Palestinian delegates to the
dialogue and said the agenda should be open.
   Arafat cited U.S. vetoes of anti-Israeli measures at the United
Nations and Washington's $3 billion annual aid to Israel, among
other things.
   ``All these positions encourage Israel,'' Arafat told
Al-Mussawar. ``With this American pampering, Israel has every right
to take a hard line.''
   Oil holds the key to forging U.S. neutrality, he said.
   ``In 1991, the United States will need Arab oil after depletion
of the North (Sea) oil and America's own oil. ... So we want
greater Arab pressure on the United States. We must be angry,
angry, angry,'' he said.
   An Arab oil boycott against the United States and other Western
countries after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war pushed the United States
into initiating Arab-Israeli military disengagement the following
year.
   Arafat said he is having difficulty restraining hard-liners
because of the lack of progress in the peace effort.
   ``I'm facing Palestinian extremists, Arab extremists and Moslem
extremists. Why don't they (Americans and Israelis) take all this
opposition into account?'' Arafat said.

   A Senate committee chairman and Colombia's
ambassador today joined President Bush in rejecting an offer by
Colombian drug lords to quit their smuggling in exchange for
immunity from prosecution.
   ``You, like us, are highly skeptical,'' Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., told Colombian Ambassador Victor Mosquera Chaux at a joint
hearing of his Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Caucus on
International Narcotics Control.
   Mosquera, in response to a question, said the government will
not negotiate with the Medellin cartel despite the overture this
week.
   ``The government has indicated that it will not negotiate with
the traffickers and that even if they were to turn themselves over,
they would be brought to justice,'' Mosquera said in Spanish
through an interpreter.
   ``Even though I don't think that the war has been won, I think
the Colombian government is very close to obtaining a total
victory,'' he said. ``Otherwise this change in attitude of The
Extraditables would be very hard to explain since it's very
different from their past activities.''
   The communique allegedly sent by The Extraditables, the armed
wing of Colombia's powerful drug leaders, offered to declare
Colombia's government the winner in its war on narcotics
traffickers. It said the drug lords would halt illegal activities
in exchange for ``constitutional guarantees.''
   The drug cartel released two kidnap victims to back up its
offer, which was similar to previous proposals that have been
rejected by the government.
   The communique followed Colombian President Virgilio Barco's
statement Tuesday night that his government is not ``inflexible''
regarding a negotiated settlement with drug lords. Previously,
Barco ruled out talks.
   Asked Wednesday about the offer by the drug lords, Bush said,
``They've got a credibility problem with me.''
   Biden said he was holding today's hearing with the ambassadors
of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia primarily to discuss long-term plans
to combat the cocaine problem.
   The envoys testified that drug trafficking was linked to
problems of foreign trade, especially the lack of an international
coffee pricing agreement, foreign debt and internal poverty,
particularly among farmers.
   Mosquera proposed a one-time $1 billion economic support program
to Colombia to ``mitigate the costs associated with the drug war,
as well as the negative effects from the breakdown of the
International Coffee Agreement.''
   The breakdown of the agreement has cost hundreds of millions of
dollars in losses to the Colombian economy, he said.
   Ambassador Cesar Atala-Nazal of Peru attended the hearing even
though he had been recalled as a result of the U.S. invasion of
Panama Dec. 20 to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``I am now back in Washington to participate in this hearing,''
he said, saying it was a gesture of ``respect and appreciation.''
   ``Otherwise, the position of Peru in regard to Panamanian events
remains unchanged,'' he said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., also asked that the events in
Panama not interfere with the Andean drug summit scheduled for Feb.
15 in Cartagena, Colombia.
   Bush and the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia had been
scheduled to attend the summit. Peruvian President Alan Garcia has
since said he would send a minister in his stead unless U.S.
invasion troops are out of Panama before then.
   Bush said Wednesday, however, that the summit schedule would not
force him to speed the troop withdrawal.
   ``We want (the troops) out of there as soon as possible,'' he
said. ``It's my objective to get the troops out and get back to the
levels before this military action. It has nothing to do with the
summit in Cartagena at all. ... I'm not driven by the summit.''
   ``Whatever our differences on that issue, all of us hope that
the summit will be helpful, and that it will generate a new spirit
of cooperation,'' Kennedy said.
   He added that ``we also regret the unfortunate controversy over
the administration's proposal to locate U.S. warships off the coast
of Colombia.''
   Defense Department sources said last week that the aircraft
carrier John F. Kennedy has been chosen to lead an interdiction
effort off Colombia but that no final decision had been made on
deployment.
   Word of the proposed deployment off the Colombian coast touched
off rumors around the hemisphere, denied here, that the United
States might try to blockade Colombia or perhaps even invade it as
a followup to the Panama invasion.

<HEAD>Latvian Exile Goes on Trial Charged with Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUENSTER, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Latvian immigrant who fled the
United States to avoid possible deportation went on trial in West
Germany today for his alleged role in the killing of 171 people
during World War II.
   Boleslavs Maikovskis, 86, is charged with complicity in the
shooting deaths of 170 residents in the village of Audrini in the
Soviet republic of Latvia in January 1942.
   He also is charged with murder for allegedly ordering the
hanging of a Jewish man from Audrini in May 1942 while acting as a
commander of a pro-Nazi police force.
   Maikovskis, a former resident of Mineola, N.Y., fled the United
States in 1987. He was facing proceedings that could have led to
his deportation to the Soviet Union for alleged war crimes.
   The Soviet Union sentenced Maikovskis to death in absentia in
1965.
   Maikovskis applied for asylum in West Germany after leaving the
United States, but was arrested at his home in Muenster in October
1988. He is in poor health and has been held in a prison hospital.
   Maikovskis today was questioned about his life in Latvia but not
about his alleged crimes.
   Speaking through an interpreter, he described himself as a
fighter for Latvia's independence and said he had joined a
pro-German organization long before Latvia was occupied by Nazi
troops.
   The organization later became an auxiliary police force that
started wearing German uniforms in 1942. He said he joined the
police force to help achieve Latvia's independence.
   Maikovskis told the court he withdrew with German troops to
Germany in 1944. At the end of the war, he spent six years as a
displaced person before receiving permission to emigrate to the
United States in 1951.
   The United States began deportation proceedings against
Maikovskis in 1976, but they were delayed by several appeals, the
last of which was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986.
   The trial adjourned until Monday. It is expected to last until
June.

   Some stops Vice President Dan Quayle wanted to
make in Central and South America ``may have to be scheduled for a
later time,'' the White House said today, as Latin countries
continue to voice resentment over the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   ``It's not `don't come,'' Quayle acknowledged today in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``It's a matter of timing on
when you will come,'' he said, expressing the reaction he has
gotten from nations he wanted to visit.
   Quayle said his trip will be important both symbolically, to
show the administration's interest in keeping good relations with
its neighbors, and diplomatically, to try and smooth any feelings
injured by last month's invasion.
   The itinerary announced Wednesday by Quayle's office for his
trip next week, with stops in Panama, Honduras and Jamaica, falls
short of the journey indicated by President Bush's announcement
Jan. 5.
   ``Some of the trips may have to be scheduled for a later time,''
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today. He
declined to comment on the reported resistance from Latin countries.
   ``When you're scheduling these kinds of things some can be
scheduled earlier than others,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   ``The question of when the meetings take place is not nearly as
important to us as simply that the message is delivered'' that Bush
wants to restore good relations with the Latin nations, Fitzwater
said.
   Asked whether the countries were snubbing Bush in requesting
that Quayle not visit at this time, Fitzwater said, ``Obviously
there were concerns in Latin America following the Panama
situation. Obviously there were reasons why the president felt it
was necessary to reiterate our support and our interest in working
with them.''
   Quayle's trip to the Jan. 27 Honduran presidential inauguration
has long been planned. On that trip, aides said Wednesday, he will
stop in Panama, where he is expected to voice support for the
U.S.-installed government of Guillermo Endara.
   He also is to visit Jamaica, which joined the 20-1 vote on Dec.
22 deploring the U.S. military invasion of Panama.
   Other than those stops, Quayle's office has been unable to set
up any specific visits except the previously scheduled trips to
Chile and Brazil for their mid-March inaugurations, said one
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Quayle's office said
he would make stops yet to be determined as part of that trip.
   It is anticipated that he will use the three inaugural trips to
meet with other presidents who attend.
   Venezuelan officials in Washington have told reporters they
would prefer that Quayle not visit.
   In Caracas today, Venezuela's foreign minister, Reinaldo
Figueredo, said, ``We understand he's not coming,'' but refused to
say why.
   Figueredo said in a television interview Wednesday, however,
``Maybe his visit is not the most adequate step to be taken given
the conditions that exist with respect to the U.S. invasion of
Panama.''
   In addition, the head of Venezuela's main opposition party,
Eduardo Fernandez, said Wednesday that a visit ``would not be
convenient.''
   Quayle aides Wednesday night declined to confirm or deny a
report in today's editions of The New York Times that Quayle had
dropped plans to stop in Venezuela and Mexico because of objections
from those countries.
   Quayle said Wednesday that ``diplomatic sensitivities'' have
held up scheduling of his trip. But he denied any lingering ``deep
resentment'' among Latin leaders after the Dec. 20 invasion of
Panama.
   ``No country has said, `We don't want the vice president,
period','' he told a luncheon gathering of the Hoover Institution.
   He later told The Associated Press, however, ``There are
diplomatic sensitivities. There's a matter of timing on when you
go. There's a matter of coordination. And these things have all got
to be worked out.''
   The Jamaica stop is another signal of the much friendlier
relations between Washington and the government of Prime Minister
Michael Manley, a onetime strident opponent of the United States.
   Latin officials have said this is not a good time for Quayle to
visit their countries because of strong sentiment against the
continued presence of U.S. troops in Panama.
   An official who spoke anonymously said all have indicated they
will welcome Quayle eventually, but not this soon after the
invasion. Subsequent reports that Bush was planning to use U.S.
ships to intercept drugs off Colombia _ which surprised the
Colombian government _ added further to the anti-American feelings,
the official said.
   Bush, in assigning Quayle to visit the region, said he
understood the sensitivities of the Latin Americans to the U.S.
military action in their region and was sending Quayle to explain
the action was not taken lightly or without rationale.
   Quayle told the lunch group he was not going to the region to
apologize, but to consult with the leaders ``on how we make Panama
a successful democracy.''
   He told a reporter later, ``I do not believe that the heads of
state are unhappy or resentful of our actions in Panama. I think
they understand it. That's one of the reasons I'm going down, to
find out what their true feelings are.''
   Bush said Wednesday he wants to withdraw the invasion force from
Panama ``as soon as possible,'' but he feels no pressure to get
them out before the Feb. 15 drug summit.
   Peru's president, Alan Garcia, is refusing to attend the drug
summit while the troops remain, but he plans to send a minister.
   Bush congratulated Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the commander of the
U.S. invasion, at the White House on Wednesday for an ``outstanding
job.''
   The president denied difficulties in finding countries willing
to host Quayle in the region.

   Antonio Cipollone, whose lawsuit against
three cigarette makers in the death of his first wife resulted in
the first jury damage award for a smoker's death, has died, his
wife said today.
   Cipollone was admitted to Community Memorial Hospital in Toms
River Jan. 4 and died Jan. 10 of pneumonia and heart failure, said
Dorothy Cipollone. He was 66.
   A day after he entered the hospital, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals overturned a $400,000 judgment against Liggett Group
Inc. But the court ordered a new trial and opened the door for
other issues.
   The June 1988 award after a four-month trial was the first
granted by a jury in a lawsuit brought by a smoker or relatives
against the tobacco industry.
   Cipollone had carried on the suit brought by him and his first
wife, Rose, who died at 58 of lung cancer in 1984. The suit named
Liggett, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc., which made the
cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone smoked.
   Cipollone knew about the reversal, but ``it didn't seem to
concern him in the least,'' said Dorothy Cipollone.
   ``He was happy that he had gone through with whatever his wife,
Rose, had started. He never had regrets.''
   Cipollone's attorney, Marc Z. Edell, said the family was still
deciding whether to continue the case. No other family members were
parties to the original suit.
   Cipollone was born in Italy and came to the United States at age
15, living first in New York City. He worked in construction and as
a cable splicer for U.S. Steel and in his own business before
retiring in 1986.
   He and Rose lived for years in Little Ferry, and he spent the
last years of his life in Lakehurst.

   King Fahd will ship 1.6 million
copies of the Koran, the Moslem holy book, to the Soviet Union, it
was reported Thursday.
   ``This is the largest operation in history for transportation
and distribution of the Koran,'' said Abdullah Omar Naseef,
secretary-general of the Mecca-based Moslem World League.
   The weekly newspaper Al-Muslimoon quoted Naseef as saying that
if Aeroflot quotes a competitive price, it will be allowed to fly
to Saudi Arabia to airlift the consignment. The ultra-religious
kingdom has no diplomatic relations with any Communist nation.
   Naseef said it was the first consignment of Islamic books to the
Soviet Union since the country lifted a long-standing ban on
Islamic and Christian literature last summer.
   According to Al-Muslimoon, 600,000 of the Korans are in a
variant of Turkish and the rest are in Arabic, the original
language of the holy book.
   A three-man delegation will go to Moscow to arrange for the
transport and distribution of the books, as well as explore the
possibility of establishing a printing press in the Soviet Union
for the Koran and other Islamic books, Naseef said.
   He said there are only 30,000 copies of Koran in the Soviet
Union, where Moslems number 70 million.
   The Moslem World League is a non-governmental pan-Islamic
organization funded mainly by Saudi Arabia.

   The government has canceled a national
referendum on whether to ban the Communist Party and reimpose the
death penalty because the decision to hold it was not carefully
thought out, a spokesman said today.
   Siviu Brucan of the governing National Salvation Front said the
decision was made Wednesday night during a meeting of the Front's
executive council. At the same meeting, the council ruled that the
Communist Party's assets will be confiscated.
   ``The referendum will no longer take place,'' Brucan told a news
conference.
   It was the second major turnaround by the revolutionary
government in less than a week.
   On Saturday, President Ion Iliescu retracted a ban on the
Communist Party that he had announced the previous day and instead
said it would be on the referendum Jan. 28, along with the
previously scheduled question of whether to reimpose the death
penalty.
   Like Brucan today, Iliescu said he backed off his decision
because it had been made too hastily.
   Brucan said leaders were guilty of ``almost panicky
decision-making'' Friday when they promised the referendum to end
huge protests by people demanding legalization of the death penalty
and a ban on the Communist Party.
   Earlier today, government spokesman Dan Radulescu said the Front
was considering either calling off or postponing the referendum
because of time constraints.
   ``It is very difficult to organize a referendum in only 10
days,'' he said.
   The cancellation was the latest sign of the government's
indecision over crucial issues and its difficulty coping with the
public's lingering distrust of the government, which includes
several former Communists.
   During the past week, several visting West European officials
who have come to discuss aid to Romania have spoken out against
renewal of the death penalty, which was outlawed after the
executions Dec. 25 of ousted leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena.
   Also today, two daughters of exiled King Michael flew from
Geneva to Bucharest for their first visit to the country. The king,
who went into exile in 1948, has offered to return as head of a
constitutional moncharchy.
   Princesses Margarita and Sophie were expected to stay at least
five days, but sources close to the family gave no further details
on their trip.
   The minister of petroleum, Victor Murea, said in an interview
that the country cannot produce enough natural gas to meet all its
needs and will be forced to limit some energy supplies to
non-essential industries.
   Murea told the newspaper Adevarul that the country can only
produce natural gas to meet 60 percent of its needs and that
production is dropping as resources are depleted.
   ``Daily production today is only 79 percent of what it was three
years ago,'' he said.
   To conserve natural gas, some industrial users will have to
switch to oil and others will have to be shut down at least
temporarily, he said. ``Only those economic units that produce
strictly necessary goods can be allowed to function,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, officials in the domestic food ministry said the
country was also being forced to reimpose food rationing in some
areas because of shortages.
   During Ceausescu's rule, heating and food supplies were strictly
limited as an austerity measure to help Romania pay off a $10.5
billion foreign debt.
   After the otherthrow of Ceausescu on Dec. 22, the government
immediately increased heat in apartments and offices and stopped
rationing.

   Twenty sick or disabled Iranian soldiers
captured by Iraq in their eight-year war arrived in Tehran on
Thursday, a day after Iran repatriated 50 similar Iraqi prisoners,
Tehran radio reported.
   The prisoners were welcomed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport by
Mahmoud Aqamiri, an official in charge of Iraqi prisoners-of-war in
Iran.
   Aqamiri deplored the lopsided exchange, saying that ``the fact
that the Iraqi regime had released only 20 Iranian prisoners in
exchange for 50 released by us the previous day, limits the
possibility for other such exchanges,'' according to the broadcast,
monitored in Cyprus.
   Aqamiri said that 53 Iraqi prisoners had been freed by Tehran
Wednesday, but that three had requested asylum in Iran.
   The Iranians were flown to Iran aboard the same International
Red Cross-chartered plane that carried the Iraqis.
   An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said the release of the
Iranian prisoners was made ``in confirmation of Iraq's humanitarian
policy and its commitment to international conventions.''
   The Red Cross had mediated an agreement between Iran and Iraq to
repatriate the ailing and disabled POWs immediately after the
cease-fire, which took effect in August 1988.
   According to Red Cross estimates, more than 900 ailing and
disabled POWs remain held by both sides, with a total of 50,000
other prisoners held by Iran and 19,200 by Iraq.
   United Nations officials and diplomats put the total number of
POWs held by both sides at about 100,000.

   A car bomb exploded in the parking
lot of Islamabad's International Airport on Thursday, hours after a
smaller bomb exploded outside the airport in the frontier city of
Peshawar, police said.
   No one was injured in either incident. Police said seven people
have been arrested in connection with the Islamabad bombing.
   The Islamabad airport was closed for several hours and three
flights were delayed. The car in which the bomb was hidden was
parked in a remote corner of the sprawling parking lot, police said.
   The bomb in Peshawar, the headquarters for Afghanistan's
anti-Communist guerrilla leadership, startled residents who lived
near the airport but caused no damage.
   U.S. Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt had arrived in
Peshawar to meet with guerrilla leaders about an hour before the
explosion. He is the highest ranking State Department official to
visit Pakistan since Soviet combat troops left Afghanistan in
February 1989.
   Scores of bombs have exploded in Peshawar in the past two years,
with police blaming agents of Afghanistan's Communist government.
Police have refused to speculate who was behind Thursday's bombing.

   President Bush today denounced as ``a
charade'' a Democratic proposal to cut the Social Security payroll
tax and said it was really an attempt to force him to raise other
taxes.
   Bush also promised that he will not acquiesce in any move that
would raise taxes or lead to lower Social Security benefits for
older Americans.
   Reporters asked the president about the proposal by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., at the start of a meeting between Bush
and visiting Turkish President Turgut Ozal.
   Bush pointed to his foreign visitor and replied, ``We have the
same feeling about it. We both draw a blank when we hear about it.''
   ``It's an effort to get me to raise taxes on the American people
by the charade of cutting them, or cut benefits, and I am not going
to do it to the older people of this country,'' he said.
   It was Bush's first public comments on the sensitive Moynihan
proposal, which has drawn support from Democrats and Republicans
alike despite warnings from the White House that it was a trap for
the GOP.
   Moynihan has suggested rolling back the recent Social Security
payroll tax hike, saving workers $7 billion this year and $55
billion in fiscal 1991.
   Another Democrat, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, has
proposed a 5 percent value-added tax _ a national sales levy _ to
raise $53 billion in 1991 and cover the revenues lost both by the
Social Security tax cut and Bush's proposal to lower the tax on
capital gains.
   ``First we had the tax cut and now we have the tax increase. Can
cuts in benefits be far behind? Look out older Americans,'' White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said earlier today.
   Fitzwater boasted that he was a prophet on Monday when he called
the politically popular Moynihan proposal ``a wolf in sheep's
clothing'' and just a ruse to force an increase in other taxes.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, in an interview Wednesday with The
Associated Press, also labeled Moynihan's proposal ``a political
trap'' that would lead to higher overall taxes later.
   The payroll tax, paid by both employers and employees, jumped to
7.65 percent on Jan. 1 from 7.51 percent, and it is now levied on
wages up to $51,300 instead of $48,000. Self-employed people pay
15.3 percent.
   Moynihan contends the payroll tax should be scaled back now
because of mounting surpluses in the Social Security trust funds.
Under a plan endorsed by a Social Security rescue commission that
Moynihan was part of in 1983, the trust funds are supposed to build
up annual surpluses of tens and eventually hundreds of billions of
dollars each year to help pay for baby boomers' retirement in the
next century.
   But the excess now is being lent to the government, which uses
the funds to pay for other federal programs and hold down the
overall deficit.
   Hollings wants to impose a value added tax on sales of
everything except food, health care and housing. It would be levied
at each stage of production.
   Asked if he felt there was a conspiracy between Hollings and
Moynihan, Fitzwater said:
   ``They're all part of the same party that has this interest in
this proposal. But it's been clear from the beginning that if you
cut the Social Security taxes at some point you got to raise taxes
to get the money back or you got to cut benefits. We don't want to
be associated with either one of those outcomes.''

   Premier Marian Calfa has quit the
Communist Party, reducing the number of Communists in the 21-member
federal government to seven, a government spokesman said today.
   Calfa is the third minister in the coalition government to leave
the Communist Party in the last two weeks.
   Zbynek Fiala, head of the government's press department, made
the announcement at a news conference. When asked by a reporter
whether Calfa had in fact left the party, he replied, ``Yes, it is
true.''
   He did not say when or why Calfa had given up his party
membership.
   First Deputy Premier Valtr Komarek, who is in charge of economic
affairs, quit the party at the beginning of last week. He followed
Vladimir Dlouhy, the head of the State Planning Commission, who
took the same step.
   The Communist Party's troubles began Nov. 17, when police beat
pro-democracy student demonstrators. The confrontation ignited
Czechoslovakia's anti-Communist revolution, and hard-line party
chief Milos Jakes and the rest of the leadership resigned a week
later.
   The government headed by Calfa was sworn in in mid-December by
former President Gustav Husak, who resigned afterward.
   Husak was replaced by Vaclav Havel, who had been
Czechoslovakia's most prominent human rights activist before the
revolution.
   Calfa, 44, participated in the negotiations the led to the
current government, the first not dominated by Communists in 41
years, and was the first Communist official to publicly endorse
Havel for president.
   Calfa is expected to make an official visit to neighboring
Austria Jan. 30.

   Cam Ranh Bay, a former American base during the Vietnam War, is
the Soviets' largest foreign base, according to U.S. military

   A tractor-trailer rig carrying 2-foot-long
rocket motors for the military burst into flames after being struck
by a car early today, killing the car's driver and forcing the
evacuation of 100 people, authorities said.
   A car slammed into the side of the 18-wheeler at an intersection
on U.S. 431 about 12:15 a.m., said state trooper Sgt. Ronnie
Stinson. The car became lodged under the trailer and was dragged
about 200 yards.
   The car caught fire, and the truck's cargo of several solid-fuel
rocket motors began exploding, he said. Officials had to briefly
evacuate about 100 people from nearby trailer homes and a store
before calling Army explosive experts from Fort McClellan.
   The trooper said the driver of the car was killed, but
authorities had not made a positive identification.
   However, officials at Wellborn High School identified the victim
as a student there, Chris Corzine, 18. Principal Howard Waldrep
said he already had informed Corzine's classmates of his death.
   Neither the truck driver, Larry Eller, 27, nor an assistant,
Mike Ryan, 28, was injured. Stinson said the two men drove the
tractor away from the trailer section of the rig as the explosions
began.
   ``I wouldn't have wanted to do what they did,'' he said.
   Stinson said the truck, owned by Peninsula Trucking Co., was
hauling rocket motors from Atlantic Research Corp. in Gainesville,
Va., to the Huntsville offices of Wyle Laboratories, a government
contractor. The truck had made a stop in Georgia, he said.
   Bill Meyer, manufacturing director for Atlantic Research, said
the motors were for classified military use. Meyer said the company
believed there may not have been any explosions, only the flashes
of quick-burning rocket fuel.
   ``Their burn time is one second,'' he said.
   Gary Johnson, a spokesman with Atlantic Research, said six of
the seven rocket motors on the truck contained fuel. The motors are
about two feet long and two feet in diameter, and each contains
20-25 pounds of solid rocket fuel, he said.
   He described the engines as shroud motors, used to pull the nose
cone cover off a missile during the flight, that were being sent to
Lyle Labs for testing for the Air Force. But he wouldn't say which
program these motors are used in.
   Johnson said Atlantic Research makes both the motor and the fuel.

   Shootings such as that of Nagasaki's Mayor Hitoshi
Nagashima are rare in Japan, where weapons control has been strict
since the samurai were forbidden to carry swords in 1868.
   About 315 gun battles between rival gangs during a 1985-88
underworld power struggle accounted for the bulk of the nation's
shooting incidents in that period. Twenty-five people died in those
shootings.
   Overall, murder has been declining in Japan, from about 1,650
cases in 1980 to about 1,450 in 1988. Of these, only a tiny
fraction were committed with guns.
   In the United States, with twice the population, there were more
than 20,000 murders in the same year, about half of them committed
with firearms. Japan's overall crime rate has been estimated at
about one-fifth that of the U.S. rate.
   Strict gun control under Japan's Firearms and Sword Control Law
and a tradition of obedience are among reasons cited for the
difference.
   Illegal possession of hand guns can result in prison sentences
of up to 10 years. The maximum penalty for murder is death, carried
out by hanging.
   In recent years, however, gunrunning from Southeast Asia,
especially the Philippines, has been on the rise. The National
Police Agency says it seizes about 1,500 firearms, mainly pistols,
each year.
   The smugglers are mostly ``yakuza'' gangsters arming themselves
for gang skirmishes. Some of the gangs reputedly have close ties to
right-wing groups.
   Since the end of World War II, political assassinations have
been rare. The shooting of Motoshima was the first attack on a
major political figure with a gun since the war, police records
show.
   But rightists have carried out 25 other attacks on key
politicians using knives, swords, explosives or fists, the agency
said.
   In the most famous case, on Oct. 12, 1960, Socialist Party
leader Inejiro Asanuma was stabbed to death with a sword by a
right-wing assailant during a televised rally.
   Assassinations were frequent in Japan during the 1930s, a period
in which right-wing nationalism eventually led to de facto military
rule. Prime Minister Osachi Hamaguchi was killed by right-wingers
in 1930.
   In May 1932, Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai was assassinated,
and democratic government collapsed in Japan until its revival
under the Allied occupation in 1945.

   The Boeing Co. said today it expects to lay off
1,700 workers in the Puget Sound area by April and anticipates
reducing its work force in the area by as much as 5,000 people this
year.
   Attrition should account for about half the total reduction, the
company said in a news release.
   Boeing, by far the largest private employer in Washington state,
said about 1,400 of the 1,700 hourly employees expected to be laid
off are at the company's Everett plant, where production startup
for the new 747-400 jumbo jet has been completed.
   The announcement made no mention of layoffs at Boeing plants in
other parts of the country. It had been rumored since late last
year.
   ``Because the new 777 airplane program is still not formally
approved and with uncertainties in the defense budget, Boeing will
continue to review and revise its workforce requirements throughout
the year,'' the company said.
   Layoff notices will be issued Friday to about 1,900 employees
who might be among the 1,700 workers laid off starting March 20,
the company said. It said it will provide counseling and help the
laid-off workers find new jobs.
   At the end of 1989, Boeing had just under 106,700 employees in
Washington state, and increase of almost 10,000 from the beginning
of the year.
   Nationwide, Boeing employment had grown to 145,200, up 10,800
from the beginning of the year.

   Billy Crystal will be host for the ceremonies, which will be

producer Gil Cates said.
   Noting the Oscar telecast had developed into a ``monster variety
show,'' Cates said, ``This year's strategy is to move it over to
more of a social event and news program.''
   Some announcements of winners may be made in the satellite
cities, but the presentation of the Oscar statuettes will still be
made at the Los Angeles Music Center.
   Last year's Oscar telecast was critically panned and opening
ceremonies featuring Snow White brought a lawsuit from the Disney

   A prison counselor held hostage by an
inmate for more than 30 hours was freed after officers stormed the
office where the standoff was taking place.
   The hostage, Nancy Boyd, 49, was not hurt in the assault that
occurred near midnight Wednesday, prison spokeswoman Lee Mann said.
Another counselor at the Mack Alford Correctional Center had been
released earlier.
   The inmate, Otis Ray Vann, a convicted robber, was taken into
custody and transferred to another prison. Corrections spokesman
Jerry Massie said preliminary reports were that he suffered some
internal and pelvic injuries, but did not require hospitalization.
   Vann, 39, took Ms. Boyd and another counselor, Paul Williams,
hostage about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday, officials said. Vann reportedly
was armed with a razor blade stuck in the end of an ink pen.
   A team of 11 rescuers armed with riot batons subdued Vann and
rescued Ms. Boyd, authorities said. One of the rescuers, Derk
McCarty, suffered an injured shoulder.
   Vann had released Williams, 50, early Wednesday morning in
exchange for food after speaking with two state representatives,
prison officials said. Williams was described afterward as shaken
but unhurt.
   Rep. Tommy Thomas said Vann was rational and calm, and had
``made some comment that he hadn't been treated with as much
respect as he should have been.''
   Ms. Mann said that Wednesday afternoon, Vann made eight requests
involving 11 issues, which were not disclosed.
   Massie said Vann took the counselors captive on the second floor
of the prison's west dorm. He said the inmates normally housed in
the west dorm were taken to the prison gymnasium for the night.
   Massie said Vann began serving a 15-year sentence for robbery
with a dangerous weapon on Oct. 1, 1989, and also is serving a
concurrent seven-year sentence for forgery and a concurrent
five-year sentence for possession of stolen property. He also faces
parole violation charges in Texas, officials said.

   The European Parliament on Thursday
urged the European Community to grant emergency aid to Armenia and
the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, but did not specify how much.
   It also suggested a fact-finding mission be sent to the troubled
region in the southern Soviet Union.
   In a resolution backed by almost all political groups in the
518-seat assembly, the parliament called on the Soviet government
to order an end to the blockade of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and
to guarantee the safety of people there.
   Parliamentarians said they were concerned that the ``repeated
threats of secession'' would have dire consequences on the
``budding process of democratization in the Soviet Union.''
   The largely Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh wants to be
under the control of the republic of Armenia, not the republic of
Azerbaijan.
   The parliament urged the European Community to ``make
representations to the Soviet authorities ... (to order) the full
and immediate lifting of the blockade imposed on Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh.''
   The EC should also call on the Soviets to guarantee the
``freedom of movement and the safety of goods and persons'' between
Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, the parliament said.
   Noting that ``according to some sources, arms from Iran have
been delivered'' to the Azerbaijanis, the parliament called on all
nations, especially those bordering Armenia, ``to avoid all
interference.''

   It's still dangerous to exercise the right of free
speech in Japan, especially in criticizing an imperial family that
is held sacrosanct by a violence-prone rightist fringe.
   The shooting Thursday of Nagasaki Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima was a
vivid demonstration that rightist death threats can become real.
   Motoshima, who provoked controversy for saying the late Emperor
Hirohito bore some responsibility for World War II, was shot in the
back and seriously wounded. Five hours later, police arrested the
leader of a rightist group on suspicion of attempted murder and
said he had admitted the shooting.
   The government and some who have been targets of rightist
attacks, including reporters, quickly condemned the attack.
   ``These sorts of attacks, using violence to curb freedom of
speech, are unforgivable,'' said Osamu Asano, deputy secretary
general of the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association.
   The attack shows the lingering threat from anti-Communist
extremists, who have intimidated government officials and
businessmen for years.
   The arrested leader of the Sane Thinkers' Group, Kazumi Tajiri,
was on record saying he was willing to kill.
   Asked in 1987 if he would kill somebody he hated, Tajiri
responded, ``Yes, because after all, right-wingers are
terrorists.'' TV Asahi broadcast a tape of the interview after
Tajiri was arrested.
   Rightists prowl the streets of Tokyo and other cities in huge
black trucks decorated with the rising sun flag of the militaristic
past, using powerful loudspeakers to harass their targets _
newspapers, embassies, government offices and companies _ with
ear-splitting military music and epithets.
   The groups have scant public support, but the threat of a visit
from them is enough to prevent many Japanese from speaking their
minds.
   Executives doing business in socialist countries generally
refuse to be quoted. Government officials responsible for relations
with the socialist bloc are also reticent.
   ``If I allowed you to use my name, the trucks would be right
outside the doors of our company and maybe even outside my home,''
said one businessman. ``They already give us enough trouble.''
   Motoshima violated the rightists' most sensitive taboo in
December 1988 when he said that Hirohito, on his deathbed at the
time, was partly responsible for the war. Hirohito died Jan. 7,
1989, at age 87.
   More than 70,000 people died in Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, when a
U.S. plane dropped an atomic bomb on the city. Three days earlier,
about 140,000 died in Hiroshima, the first city ever to suffer an
atomic bomb attack. Japan surrendered six days after the Nagasaki
bombing.
   Hirohito was worshiped as a living god before renouncing his
divine status after the war, and the rightists still venerate the
royal family.
   Motoshima received strong public support _ a group of Nagasaki
residents sent him petitions with more than 286,000 signatures
backing him. But he also got death threats and a procession of
rightist sound trucks outside his office.
   ``Death to Motoshima!'' was a constant chant. The mayor received
threatening letters containing bullets. City Hall was fired upon in
March.
   Motoshima, an independent, is the 26th major politician in
postwar Japan to be assaulted, police say.
   The most shocking case came in 1960, when a right-wing student
fatally stabbed Japan Socialist Party chairman Inejiro Asanuma at a
televised party rally.
   In May, two rightists slightly injured Socialist Secretary
General Tsuruo Yamaguchi and another Socialist politician at a
party gathering.
   In December, a rightist group reportedly sent a severed finger
to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's residence to protest the
government debate over funding inaugeration ceremonies for
Hirohito's son, Emperor Akihito.
   Another rightist fired a pistol and barricaded himself inside a
tax office near the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo in July to
protest the inheritance tax levied on the emperor's $12.9 million
estate. Nobody was injured.
   Left-wing extremists have launched attacks on the imperial
family. Leftists recently fired projectiles at the home of Prince
Hitachi, Akihito's younger brother, causing some damage but no
injuries.
   Journalists also have been casualties of rightist attacks.
   In May 1987, a masked gunman walked into a bureau of Japan's
second-largest newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, and killed one
reporter and wounded another.
   Other newspapers also have experienced attacks, and the Asahi
Shimbun headquarters has been fired upon and harassed by rightist
sound trucks.
   ``The people who attacked the Asahi Shimbun still haven't been
caught,'' said Asano of the publishers' association. ``Violence of
this sort threatens our freedom of speech and of the press.''
   Author Sae Sawachi agreed. ``Using terror to threaten people who
hold different opinions is the greatest threat to democracy,''
Sawachi said.

   Inga Lourey says she's never met a drug
trafficker, but for seven months she and other business owners
unwittingly paid rent to one.
   Now they're paying the federal government, which seized the
property.
   Ms. Lourey and her husband, Carl, own a supermarket in the Park
II Alto Mesa shopping center on El Paso's upscale west side.
Unbeknown to them, the $4.3 million center was owned by Rafael
Munoz Talavera, considered the ``premier godfather'' of cocaine
smuggling from Mexico into the United States, government officials
say.
   Federal investigators say he headed a smuggling ring that moved
at least 60 tons of cocaine into the United States during 1989,
including the 21.4 tons discovered last September in a warehouse in
Sylmar, Calif.
   Munoz Talavera was arrested shortly after the warehouse was
seized and now is jailed just a few miles from Ms. Lourey's store,
across the border in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico.
   In November, the U.S. Marshals Service seized the shopping
center and told the Loureys and other merchants who their landlord
had been.
   Ms. Lourey said she had no idea who owned the shopping center.
``We just had an address we sent the rent to,'' she said.
   ``There are a lot of people doing business with criminals who do
not have any way of being aware of it at the time,'' said Steven T.
Boyle, spokesman for Marshals Service headquarters in Arlington, Va.
   The shopping center is one of more than 26,300 properties seized
by the Marshals Service in 1989 _ from real estate to cars and
personal belongings _ as the result of drug investigations, Boyle
said.
   There is little anyone can do to avoid doing business with a
drug dealer, Boyle said, since usually the first information
linking someone with the illegal trade comes out when they're
indicted or arrested.
   And by then, it probably is too late for the innocent business
person to avoid feeling the consequences, as the Loureys found out.
   When the public learned of the shopping center seizure, some of
Ms. Lourey's customers believed merchants there might be fronts for
drug dealers.
   ``We had some snide remarks from customers. Some were saying:
`If you're involved in laundering money, we're not coming to the
store anymore.' Others said they would boycott the store,'' she
said.
   Merchants became so worried that they got the U.S. Marshals
Service to issue a statement saying their businesses are legitimate.
   But Ms. Lourey worries that something similar will happen again,
and she doubts she could do anything to prevent it.
   ``Shopping centers change hands. If this happens again, are you
going to ask (the landlord) are you OK? Is your money all right?''
she asked.
   Boyle said about the only tip-off to a drug connection is
someone trying to buy something with a briefcase full of cash.
   The man who sold the shopping center said he, too, was a victim.
He said he sold the property to, and did business only with, Rafael
Munoz Tellez, the father of Munoz Talavera, not knowing the link.
   ``It hurt my business tremendously. I lost clients. A lot of
people in town talk,'' said the property seller, who spoke only on
the condition that his name not be used. He said more publicity
would further erode his business, which is just beginning to
recover.
   The shopping center was one of about a dozen residential and
commercials properties seized in El Paso and Ruidoso, N.M., as a
result of the September cocaine seizure in California. The federal
government will maintain them until a court rules whether the
suspects must forfeit the properties.
   The number of properties seized by the Marshals Service has been
escalating with the drug war. Seven times as many properties were
seized last year than were just three years ago _ 3,645 in 1986.
Last year's seizures were valued at $1.09 billion.

<HEAD>Iowa Captain to Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the USS Iowa has decided to
retire from the Navy and someday may write about the turret
explosion last April that killed 47 sailors aboard the battleship.
   ``Down the road, I might have a lot to say. But I've decided to
save all that,'' Capt. Fred P. Moosally said Wednesday.
   A Navy investigation into the explosion concluded the blast
probably was caused by sabotage by a disgruntled gunner's mate who
died in the explosion. That conclusion has been challenged by some
of the victims' families and members of Congress.
   In October, Moosally was faulted for ``administrative
deficiencies'' in training and ordnance safety found during the
investigation. Navy officials said the deficiencies had nothing to
do with the explosion.
   Moosally, 45, may be the final captain of the Iowa. The Navy
said Wednesday that the Iowa, now at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for
repairs to the turret and other maintenance work, will be
mothballed afterward to save money.
   The Iowa's sister ship, the New Jersey, also will be taken out
of service, leaving the Navy with two of its four active
battleships.
   Moosally's request to retire is being processed and is subject
to approval by the secretary of the Navy, a spokesman for the
Atlantic Fleet's Surface Force said Wednesday.
   Saying Moosally had ``24 years of distinguished service,'' Lt.
Cmdr. John Lloyd said no pressure was placed on him to retire.
   Moosally, a 1966 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, said his
decision to retire was made last weekend after discussions with his
wife and his three children.

<TEXT>
   The government will reassess
the need for bans on the African National Congress, the South
African Communist Party and other militant opposition groups, the
justice minister said Thursday.
   A ``comprehensive review'' of the legal status of all restricted
and banned organizations was beginning, said Justice Minister Kobie
Coetsee.
   The ANC, outlawed since 1960, has listed the lifting of such
bans as one of its preconditions for halting its guerrilla campaign
and joining negotiations on a new political system that would
include the black majority.
   Murphy Morobe, spokesman for the United Democratic Front, a
national anti-apartheid coalition aligned with the ANC, said, ``If
Mr. Coetsee really means what he says, it can only be welcomed.''
   Coetsee's statement followed a defiant announcement Wednesday by
the United Democratic Front that it would resume full-scale, overt
operations. The front has been forced to operate clandestinely
since February 1988, when it was among 17 groups prohibited from
conducting any activities.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, in response, invited the
United Democratic Front to apply for the restrictions to be lifted
but said its leaders could face prosecution of they resumed
operations without getting permission.
   Morobe called Vlok's comment ``disturbing.' Morobe said, ``The
government needs to learn that freedom of expression and
association should never be dished out like an act of benevolence.
It is a human right which we in the UDF strongly believe the
government has no legitimate right to deny.''
   The pro-government newspaper Beeld said in an editorial that the
government should lift the bans that prohibit South African news
media from quotiing designated opposition leaders, including many
officials of the ANC and Communist Party.
   In the same edition, Beeld quoted banned Communist leader Joe
Slovo as saying his party no longer endorsed the goal of a
one-party system for South Africa.
   Business Day, a liberal daily, carried similar remarks by Slovo
in its editions Thursday. There has been no indication either
newspaper faces legal action.

   More than 50 protesters rallied at a
downtown hotel today, disrupting and forcing recess of a meeting
sponsored by a Wisconsin lobbying group opposed to some Indian
treaty provisions.
   The three days of meetings are sponsored by the Wisconsin
Counties Association, a group of elected county officials in
Wisconsin. Gov. Norm Bangerter has said Utah officials would shun
the meeting.
   About 20 of the protesters, including Indians and their local
supporters, picketed outside the hotel. Inside, 30 others lined up
at the meeting room door, trying to gain entrance to the meeting
from which most Indian tribal leaders were denied entry.
   Mark Rogacki, executive director of the association, said
representatives of county governments in more than a dozen states
planned to attend the conference. He said the conference would
center on issues surrounding the exercise of rights within treaties
and application of Indian governments on non-Indians.
   WCA Director Mark Rogacki recessed the session following an
angry confrontation with David Hill, a Choctaw Indian from Konawa,
Okla., who entered the room and refused to leave.
   When Rogacki told Hill he could not attend the meeting, Hill
called Rogacki a ``cockroach,'' and said he would not voluntarily
leave. Rogacki recessed the meeting.
   About a dozen police officers were called to the hotel and began
clearing the meeting area. There was no violence.
   Critics say members of the association are trying to curtail
Indians' off-reservation access to natural resources.
   ``They're out there to find reasons to abolish the treaties,''
Chippewa spokesman Michael Allen said in Wisconsin.
   Chippewa in Wisconsin have off-reservation rights to timber,
wild grain, fish and game under 19th century treaties upheld by a
federal court in 1983. Treaty opponents say the ruling
discriminates against non-Chippewa businessmen, fishermen and
hunters.
   Rogacki said the issues are complex, concerning water rights,
mineral rights, gambling, the judicial process and tax exemptions.
He said Wisconsin county governments have jurisdictional disputes
with the Chippewa tribe.
   The treaties were signed originally with the federal government
but federal officials refuse to help, he said, adding, ``the feds
have taken a walk on this.''
   Loretta Metoxen, recording secretary for the National Congress
of American Indians, said the group seeks to abrogate the treaties
and take away Indians' rights.
   ``I think the fact that the counties are meeting out there and
not inviting Indians suggests something might be amiss,'' said Sue
Erickson, a spokeswoman for the Great Lakes Indian Fish and
Wildlife Commission, which oversees off-reservation fishing and
hunting regulations for Wisconsin's Chippewa.
   Utah's governor is avoiding the conference and hopes to improve
relations with Utah Indian tribes. Francine Giani, a spokeswoman
for Bangerter, said Wednesday that he wants to avoid ``the
appearance of anything that would threaten treaties.''
   Giani said the governor has worked hard to improve relationships
with Utah's various tribes and wants to continue to work with them.
Conference organizers failed to make the meeting a cooperative
affair between Indians and local governments, she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of House Armed Services Committee
called on the Bush administration Thursday to delay production of
some high-tech weapons in light of budget pressures and a lessening
Soviet threat.
   ``What we might do is pursue a real research and development
system, rather than a develop and buy system,'' Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., said in a speech delivered to the National Strategy Forum
in Chicago.
   A text of the address to the private group interested in
national security issues was released in Washington.
   The Wisconsin Democrat said the Warsaw Pact can no longer be
perceived as a cohesive military alliance ready to respond blindly
to orders from Moscow. In response to areas where the threat has
diminished, the United States should reduce its spending on defense.
   If an agreement is reached creating numerical parity among
Warsaw Pact and NATO, the United States ``might not need to pursue
expensive, risky, high-tech weapons designed to attack them. We
have been pursuing such weapons,'' he said.
   Specifically, Aspin said full production of the Advanced
Tactical Fighter, a top secret, stealth-like aircraft, might be
delayed until it is determined whether a Soviet threat exists that
requires a fighter plane of the future.
   ``For the budget year 1991, the House Armed Services Committee
might hold up ATF and buy the current generation of fighters _ F-15
and F-16,'' the congressman said.
   But Aspin stressed the need for a new class of U.S. submarines,
the SSN-21 or Seawolf class, in response to the greatly improved
Soviet subs. Present day U.S. submarines cannot physically
accomodate the necessary improvements, he said.
   Aspin said the Bush administration has made consideration of the
1991 military budget difficult because it failed to supply
sufficient information about changes in the Soviet threat and began
discussing budget cuts before presenting a strategy.
   ``The budget that comes to us in 10 days will undoubtedly be
cut. The question is how wisely,'' Aspin said. ``What we hope to do
with the strategy ... is give our colleagues a new way of dealing
with the budget. Without such a strategy, the strongest guiding
force may be the aroma of pork.''

<HEAD>International Trade Ban Officially Enters into Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An international treaty to protect the dwindling
herds of African elephants by banning trade in ivory went into
force Thursday but leading producing and consuming nations refused
to be bound by it.
   Five southern African nations that regularly cull their elephant
populations have filed for exemption, while China has declared it
will continue importing the prized tusks.
   Britain has asked for a six-month trading extension for Hong
Kong to allow the colony to sell off its ivory stockpile of 670
tons, the world's largest.
   The trade ban was agreed after bitter debate at an October
meeting of the 103-nation Convention on Trade in Endangered
Species. Countries had until Thursday to file for an exemption to
enable them to continue trade with those members who also filed
reservations or with the 60 countries outside the convention.
   South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Malawi submitted
reservations by the deadline, said Jean-Patrick Le Duc, spokesman
for the Swiss-based convention secretariat.
   South Africa and Zimbabwe, which both have large, well-managed
elephant populations, have argued they need revenue from ivory
sales to continue protecting the majestic beast successfully.
   At last year's conference, the southern African countries
clashed with the pro-ban lobby, led by Kenya and Tanzania, which
have seen their once thriving herds drastically reduced by poaching.
   Conservationists estimate there are between 400,000 and 700,000
elephants still roaming the African continent, compared with 1.5
million in 1978.
   The World Wide Fund for Nature, which says that 125,000
elephants were killed in 1988, warns that the largest land animal
may become extinct in 10 years if the rate of slaughter increases.
   The world's biggest consumer of ivory, Japan, bowed to
international public opinion and announced at the end of October it
would respect the ban. In previous years the country had purchased
about 40 percent of world ivory exports, buying about 106 tons in
1988.
   Britain had declared it would abide by the ban, but only hours
before the deadline filed a six-month reservation for Hong Kong.
The colony has no separate voting rights in the convention.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the extension to the
trading period was designed to give traders time to dispose of the
legally acquired stocks.
   A Greenpeace spokesman in London said the organization was
``horrified by this government's sacrifice of the African elephant
to appease the greed of the Hong Kong ivory barons.''
   News of agreement on the ban in October prompted demonstrations
last year in Hong Kong, where about 4,000 people, many of them
elderly craftsmen, earn their livelihood from carving ivory.
   Beijing has imported on average 50 tons of ivory each year and
will be an important market for the African nations now that
markets in the United States, Europe and Japan are closed.
   But an official from the international group said there was
concern that despite government prohibitions, residual demand in
Western countries will still be met by smuggled ivory, be if from
poached or legally killed beasts.
   Bans on trade in a number of other animal and plant species
placed on the endangered list at the October meeting also entered
into force Thursday. These include the salmon-crested cockatoo,
Pacific Island flying foxes and 60 types of orchid.

   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki asked
parliament Thursday to move up the date for democratic elections
for local governments, saying Communist holdouts are resisting
reform.
   ``The government's most important task next to leading the
nation out of economic collapse is the building of a strong and
stable democratic foundation for a democratic system,'' Mazowiecki
told the Sejm, the lower house of parliament.
   ``Until we create a real `self-government,' we will not defeat
the resistance that we meet while introducing reforms.''
   Parliament members rose to their feet and applauded his call for
earlier elections, despite concern that Poles may blame the East
bloc's first non-Communist government for suffering caused by the
radical economic and political reforms it imposed.
   As a sign of that discontent, more than 6,000 miners demanding
higher pay were on strike for a third day at five southern mines,
the official PAP news agency reported. The strikes are the first
significant labor protest since the government began implementing
the reforms.
   The local elections had been expected in June or November, but
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Monday urged earlier balloting.
   Mazowiecki said the reforms are being implemented too slowly at
the provincial and municipal levels, where the Communist officials
remain in power.
   During the 40-minute speech, Mazowiecki also announced that
legislation abolishing censorship will be submitted next week.
   A law lifting restrictions on free speech and gatherings will be
ready in February, he said.
   Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, who watched
Mazowiecki's speech from a gallery, agrees with the new election
timetable, the pro-Solidrity Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper reported
Wednesday.
   With a non-Communist prime minister and the Communists' power
waning as economic reform sweeps state-run industries, the
provincial and municipal governments are a last area of control for
the party apparatus.
   ``The government elected in free and autonomous elections is
executing its power in the name of the people and answers directly
to them,'' Mazowiecki said. ``We have never had such a
self-government since World War II.''
   The law has allowed the prime minister to approve candidates for
mayor before they are elected by municipal councils. In that way,
all local governments were ultimately controlled by the
Communist-dominated central government.
   The Communist-run municipal governments, in turn, allowed the
party apparatus to run local affairs, including commerce,
allocation of scarce raw materials and distribution of a wide range
of privileges.
   Solidarity candidates won an overwhelming victory in free
parliamentary elections in June, leading to creation of the
Solidarity-dominated government that ended four decades of
Communist control of Poland.
   Mazowiecki said Polish-Soviet relations are now normal and no
longer guided by ``ideology and relations between Communist
parties.''
   The prime minister praised Poland as a leader of East bloc
reform and ``a stable point on the European map.''
   ``Our society accepting with dignity and calmness the
difficulties connecting with the repairing of the economy arouses
respect in many countries,'' he said.
   ``The course of our reform stimulates changes in other countries
of the region. The failure of our efforts could make more difficult
the evolution occurring in Central and Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   The prime minister also assured Poles that price increases will
lessen as the economy moves toward capitalism. He appealed to the
increasingly restive agricultural sector to understand that the
market must replace guaranteed prices for farm products.

   If a revival of ``Annie'' rises out of the ashes
of ``Annie 2,'' it will be without Dorothy Loudon as the evil Miss
Hannigan.
   ``Dorothy loves `Annie' but has decided not to do the revival,''
her agent, Lionel Larner, said. But director Martin Charnin
confirmed Wednesday he was proceeding with the revival and would
hold auditions here next week.
   Loudon, who won a Tony Award in 1977 for her performance in the
original musical, reprised the role in ``Annie 2,'' a $7 million
sequel which was subtitled ``Miss Hannigan's Revenge.'' It folds
Saturday at the Kennedy Center in Washington.
   ``Annie 2'' was supposed to open in New York on March 1 after
the Washington tryout, but its producers decided to close the show
after overwhelmingly negative reviews.
   Producers Lewis Allen and Roger Berlind had announced Monday
they were hoping to retain the stars of ``Annie 2,'' including
Loudon, Harve Presnell who plays Daddy Warbucks and Danielle
Findley who plays Annie, for the revival. It would use much of the
sets and costumes from the sequel. No opening date and theater were
announced.
   The producers of ``Annie 2'' are negotiating with the Goodspeed
Opera House to rework the show later this year either at its
theater in East Haddam, Conn., or at its second home in Chester,
Conn., which has been used as a showcase for new musicals.

<HEAD>Boyer: College Campus Life Should Be Improved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   College and university leaders should treat
students as individuals and integrate academic life with the
non-academic as a way to combat apathy, alcohol abuse and racial
and ethnic conflicts, an educator said Thursday.
   ``What higher education needs today is not more rules, but a new
post-in-loco-parentis theory of campus governance, a set of
agreed-upon standards to guide the conduct of all members of the
community and give direction to the institution overall,'' said
Ernest L. Boyer, president of The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching.
   Boyer, addressing more than 1,200 higher education leaders at an
American Council on Education meeting, suggested five principles
that can ``serve as a framework within which a vital community of
learning can be built.''
   Colleges and universities must integrate the academic life with
the non-academic, honor the ``sacredness of the individual'' and
vigorously affirm equality of opportunity, he said. Freedom of
speech must be uncompromisingly protected and civility ``powerfully
affirmed,'' he said.
   Colleges and universities must have well-defined procedures that
``guide behavior for the common good,'' as well as promote service
and show support.
   Boyer said he was troubled by a 1989 Carnegie survey that found
student apathy, alcohol abuse and racial and ethnic divisions.
Those things, he said, ``weaken the vitality of many institutions.''
   ``Administrators are understandably concerned about these
problems. But they also are, we found, ambivalent about how they
should respond,'' Boyer said.
   The study found two-thirds of the professors interviewed believe
their students are not academically well-prepared; more than 60
percent said they are teaching undergraduates what the students
should have learned in high school; and 55 percent said
undergraduates were ``doing just enough to get by.''
   A separate study found 77 percent of students spent fewer than
16 hours every week in out-of-class study.
   ``This is hardly surprising since, according to the latest ACE
data, three-fourths of today's students have a job and work, on
average, 37 hours every week,'' Boyer said.
   The survey, Boyer said, found a ``growing inclination among some
students to use words ... as weapons of assault.''
   More than 60 percent of the presidents at research and doctoral
institutions say sexual harassment is a problem and about half
listed racial harassment as a problem, he said.
   Boyer said two-thirds of all college presidents rate alcohol
abuse a serious problem, while the figure is 82 precent at research
and doctoral institutions.
   ``When we asked all presidents to name their greatest concerns,
substance abuse, especially alcohol, was listed number one,'' he
said.
   Boyer, a former U.S. education commissioner, said his proposals
were a preview of an upcoming Carnegie special report called
``Campus Life: In Search of Community.''
   The year-long study was launched in cooperation with the ACE,
the coordinating body for higher education.
   The Carnegie Foundation, headquartered at Princeton University,
was founded in 1905 as a policy center to strengthen American
education.

   Some U.S. diplomatic missions boast an
impressive array of weapons, including anti-tank missiles, to
protect America's envoys from armed attacks, according to a Bush
administration official.
   The White House complained loudly after recently finding such
weapons at the Nicaraguan ambassador's residence in Panama City and
said the practice may violate international laws governing embassy
activities.
   The residence was supposed to be off limits to outsiders but the
U.S. forces had been led to believe that the ambassador lived
elsewhere.
   President Bush called the incident a ``screw-up'' but criticized
the Nicaraguan ambassador, Atenor Ferrey, for having ``weapons up
to his eyeballs'' at the residence.
   The remark angered an administration official who said the
United States' own efforts to rotect its diplomats sometimes
include stashing large quantities of weapons at its missions.
   If a hostile group entered U.S. facilities in these countries,
``don't you think they would find RPG's (rocket-propelled
grenades)?'' the official asked. ``You don't think we have TOW
(anti-tank) missiles in some compounds?''
   Several officials, all requesting anonymity, said the incident
at the Nicaraguan embassy and others in Panama involving U.S.
troops may make American diplomats the targets of reprisals.
   One administration official, accusing the U.S. military of
failing to consider the possible fallout of its actions, said, ``We
cannot conduct diplomacy on the basis of 25-watt thinking.''
   Over the last decade, the State Department has been working to
enhance security at posts where U.S. policies are highly
controversial.
   The potential vulnerability of diplomatic missions was
underscored by the 1979 Iran hostage crisis and the 1983 attack on
the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, which claimed 47 lives.
   The discovery of the weapons cache at the Nicaraguan Embassy in
Panama prompted an administration statement Jan. 8 questioning the
legality of the Nicaraguan actions.
   The U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States,
Luigi Einaudi, said in a speech to the OAS that international law
requires diplomatic missions to be used solely for diplomacy.
   ``It would appear that the existence of a substantial arms cache
in the ambassador's residence in Panama is inconsistent with the
diplomatic functions protected by the Vienna Convention,'' Einaudi
said.
   But the union of career U.S. diplomats, the American Foreign
Service Association, said the incident at the Nicaraguan Embassy
and others at the Panamanian missions of the Vatican, Cuba and Peru
may pose threats for U.S. envoys.
   The incidents ``put in jeopardy American diplomatic missions all
over the world,'' said Perry Shankle, a former president of the
association. He was the only official interviewed who was willing
to be quoted by name.
   The association has expressed its concerns in a letter to
Defense Secretary Dick Chaney.
   The State Department insists the United States subscribes fully
to rules spelled out in the Vienna Convention of 1963, which set
rules covering the rights and privileges of embassies.
   On the other hand, the department acknowledges that an ``unusual
situation'' has prevailed in Panama.
   In an effort to track down Panamanians who had served deposed
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, American troops have been
checking cars entering and leaving the Cuban mission. Some experts
contend such vehicles apparently are exempt from such examination
under international law.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler has said the
Cuban ambassador's car ``has very dark, tinted windows which
require troops guarding the mission to open the doors to identify
the passengers.''
   But one State Department official who asked not to be named said
the action ``exposes every American ambassador to the possibility
of an armed blockade. He would have to agree to be searched. This
is appalling. This is the most appalling thing I've ever seen.''

   China has released 573 people arrested for their
part in pro-democracy protests last spring and held for six months
or more without being formally charged, it was reported Thursday.
   The ``lawbreakers'' were released after ``they pleaded guilty

Chinese sources familiar with those being let go say it does not

democracy movement are among the freed.
   Chinese sources reported recently that significant numbers of
people were being released, including students, but none was a
leader of the movement.
   The releases, like the lifting of martial law in Beijing last
week, seemed directed at foreign governments that are considering
whether to resume soft loans to China.
   The martial law decision did little to ease political repression
in the capital, still guarded by larger-than-usual troop and police
forces.
   Western nations have urged China to lift martial law and release
political prisoners as measures needed to restore relations
strained by the Beijing government's bloody suppression of the
democracy movement.
   Thousands of students and their supporters were detained
nationwide after the military attack of June 3-4 that killed
hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people.
   The official media have reported the executions of 20 people,
none of whom were students, for rioting during the nationwide
turmoil.
   Chinese sources say others have been executed secretly or
sentenced to lengthy jail terms, but an official news blackout has
left it unclear how many remain in prison and whether charges have
been brought against the detainees.
   Chinese law says prosecutors must file formal charges in court
within 45 days after a person is detained, but authorities may
extend that period in serious cases, and the law is widely ignored.
Also ignored is the legal requirement to notify families, many of
whom received the first word on their relatives' fate when they
were released.
   The ministry official said public security departments ``always
strictly observed the law and proceeded from facts in dealing with
these lawbreakers who took part in the counterrevolutionary riots.''
   He said: ``Our policy is to educate anyone who can be educated
and temper punishment with leniency.''
   He said he hoped others who ``broke the law and obstinately
stuck to the wrong course'' would repent and plead guilty for
leniency.
   Chinese sources say that many of those released still must
report to police once a week for further investigation and
confession writing. Some have had their academic degrees withheld
or are unable to get jobs.

   The issue Raymond Buckey and his mother,
Peggy McMartin Buckey, wanted the jury to consider was not whether
they were perfect people, but whether they were guilty people.
   The Buckeys spoke openly at the McMartin preschool mass
molestation trial about Buckey's problems with alcohol, his
collection of pornographic photos and Mrs. Buckey's own molestation
as a child.
   But they strongly argued that such dirty laundry, as they
characterized it, fell far short of proving them to be child
molesters.
   ``I never in my life have harmed a child, nor could I comprehend
how anyone could harm a child,'' Buckey testified in a 1986 bail
hearing in his first statements to the court.
   The Buckeys were the last remaining defendants in wha started
out in 1983 as the largest and most sensational child molestation
case ever, seven defendants accused of molesting as many as 125
children.
   Charges were dropped against five defendants, leaving the mother
and son to face 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of
conspiracy involving the alleged molestations of 11 children at
their family-owned school.
   During a 2{-year trial, some of the former students testified in
detail of being molested by the Buckeys and spoke of being
photographed, playing games like ``Naked Movie Star'' and watching
Buckey mutilate small animals.
   The Buckeys were jailed through much of the case.
   ``I've been isolated in a nightmare,'' Buckey said after his
release in February on $1.5 million bail. His mother eventually was
released on $295,000 bail.
   ``We are all innocent and have not done one thing wrong,'' Mrs.
Buckey said in May.
   Mrs. Buckey, 63, was director of the preschool, which closed in
1984.
   She became involved in the 1960s, running one of two
family-owned preschools. She took charge of both several years
later when her mother and school founder Virginia McMartin began
having health problems. In 1976, the schools merged.
   Fond of loud muumuus and flashy jewelry, Mrs. Buckey was
described by parents as flamboyant, almost to the point of being
tactless. She surprised many parents, for instance, when she
admitted that as a girl she was molested by a neighbor.
   She also said she kept a close eye on her son, who started
working at the school in 1981 after dropping out of San Diego State
University. Among his duties were watching children as they napped
or checking on children who stayed awake to play during the lunch
hour.
   Mrs. Buckey watched her son so closely that, to allay the fears
of a parent worried about a man working at the school, she checked
to see if he became aroused when students climbed onto his lap. She
said he did not.
   Mrs. Buckey characterized her son as a good teacher, except for
a problem with maintaining classroom discipline. She said her son
loved children and became a better teacher as he gained experience.
   ``He told me he felt very comfortable, that he enjoyed working
with children and felt children accepted him,'' she said. ``He did
not always feel that way about adults. The children liked him for
what he was.''
   Other witnesses, including Buckey himself, testified about his
drinking problem, his use of marijuana and his habit of wearing
shorts without underwear. Once, a student grabbed his genitals in a
classroom, Mrs. Buckey testified.
   Buckey also said he collected adult photos which he used to
sexually gratify himself.
   But Buckey denied he was guilty of child molestation.
   ``I have no sexual desire for children,'' he testified in
August. ``I never have and never will.''

<HEAD>Military Rulers Warn Against Disruption of Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government warned political parties
Thursday not to disrupt the May 27 elections after the most popular
opposition figure was disqualified from running.
   A spokesman for the ruling military junta accused a foreign
embassy and a political party of distributing anti-government
pamphlets to other embassies and parties.
   Col. Than Tun did not identify the embassy or the party but said
the pamphlets included U.S. State Department condemnations of the
detention of opposition leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo.
   Other pamphlets contained the texts of Voice of America radio
broadcasts critical of the government, he said.
   Than Tun said distribution of the pamphlets could be ``construed
as a move to create unrest.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, leaders of the popular National League
for Democracy, were put under house arrest in July and accused of
subversion. Tin Oo was sentenced last month to three years in
prison at hard labor.
   Ms. Suu Kyi has not been formally charged but a regional office
of the government-appointed Election Commission on Tuesday
disqualified her from running in the election, the first multiparty
balloting in three decades.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon said the capital was calm Thursday.
They were contacted by telephone from Bangkok, Thailand, and spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, an outspoken critic of alleged abuses by the
military government, had applied to run for a parliamentary seat in
Rangoon. She was barred partly because of alleged links to a banned
student rebel group.
   Representatives of the National League have appealed to the
central Election Commission.
   Ruling with the aid of tough martial law, Gen. Saw Maung's
government has arrested thousands of dissidents and harassed
politicians such as Ms. Suu Kyi, diplomats said.
   The junta seized power in a September 1988 coup when it crushed
a national uprising for democracy. Troops killed several thousand
dissidents that year in a series of crackdowns.
   U Nu, the country's last democratically elected prime minister,
was put under house arrest in December and banned from the election
after he refused to dissolve a parallel government he formed at the
height of the 1988 uprising.
   The 83-year-old U Nu was elected in 1960 and ousted in 1962, the
beginning of one-party military rule.
   More than a dozen ethnic groups are fighting the Burmese
government for greater autonomy.
   One group, the Karen rebels, have been fighting for four decades
along the border with Thailand.
   A Thai police officer said Thursday that Burmese troops rained
mortar fire on sawmills run by the rebels, sending more than 1,000
civilians fleeing into Thailand.
   About 1,500 troops attacked the timber sawmills, just opposite
Phob Phra district in Thailand's Tak province early Tuesday, the
officer said on condition of anonymity. He said about 1,000 rebels
and students were guarding the mills at the time.
   The Karens have financed their insurgency by controlling the
black market trade in timber and other goods between Thailand and
Burma.

<HEAD>White House to Fed: Lower Interest Rates `Are Justified'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House broke with its usual practice
of not commenting on Federal Reserve policy Thursday by suggesting
that cuts in interest rates ``are justified'' by current economic
conditions.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Jan. 8
reduction in the prime rate by banks, to 10 percent from 10.5
percent, ``hasn't been totally passed through'' and that the
administration hoped it would be.
   Although it has engaged in more subtle forms of credit easing,
the Fed has not changed its bellwether discount rate _ the rate for
short-term loans it charges to banks and other financial
institutions _ for nearly a year.
   The discount rate stands at 7 percent. Usually changes in that
rate by the Fed result in changes in other interest rates
throughout the economy.
   Asked whether the administration was intentionally sending a
message to the independent central bank from the White House
briefing room, Fitzwater said: ``This is not a new message. But
it's important occasionally to point out that lower interest rates
are normally good for the economy.''
   His comments came amid reports that momentum for easing interest
rates at the Fed may have ended.
   Fitzwater said recent economic reports argue for an easier
credit policy.
   Fitzwater, in particular, said Thursday's report by the Commerce
Department that housing starts fell by 8 percent in December was
``not good news'' and was ``well below market expectations.''
   ``That's the best indicator we have. I mean, housing starts are
more responsive to interest rates than anything else,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Bush will tell the National Association of
Homebuilders in Atlanta on Friday that ``interest rates are going
down.''
   The president will also tell his audience ``we hope'' lower
rates ``will be translated into increased market sales and that we
have always favored lower interest rates and we still do.''
   Fitzwater also reacted to an article in Thursday's editions of
The Wall Street Journal quoting two Fed members, Vice Chairman
Manuel Johnson and Wayne Angell, as indicating that lower interest
rates were not likely in the near future.
   ``We're hopeful that they (the Fed) will take a look at this
morning's indicators and understand that these numbers are low and
indicate that inflation has remained very steady over the last
seven or eight years and that lower interest rates are justified,''
the spokesman said.
   The article said the comments of the two Fed members _ who have
led the move for lower interest rates in recent months _ made
further easing by the Fed unlikely for now.
   Although the Fed has not lowered the discount rate since last
February, it has engaged in financial fine-tuning since last June
that has relieved pressure on interest rates.
   The most recent was action last Dec. 20 in supplying extra
reserves to the banking system that enabled banks to lower the rate
they charge each other for overnight loans _ the so-called federal
funds rate _ to 8.25 percent from 9.25 percent.
   To further bolster the administration's case that interest rates
should be further lowered, Fitzwater cited the Labor Department's
Thursday report that showed inflation had grown a moderate 0.4
percent in December, and had increased by 4.6 percent for all of
1989.
   Although it was the highest annual increase since 1981, Bush
said the CPI report showed in general that ``inflation is low and
under control.''
   Asked whether Bush had spoken to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan recently on the subject of interest rates, Fitzwater
said: ``He has spoken to him so often, I'm not sure that's
relevant.''
   David Berson, an economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said White House jawboning of the Fed is to be
expected.
   ``Every administration wants lower interest rates,'' he said.
``I don't think the current administration is different from any
administraion.''
   Furthermore, he said he did not think the low housing start
figure was evidence of any basic weakness in housing. ``It's
evidence only that we had very bad weather in December,'' he said.

   Undersea explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau said
Thursday the six children he took along on his recent mission to
Antarctica sometimes had a sweet view of what constitutes a good
time.
   During one jampacked day when the group went to see colonies of
penguins, seals and other creatures from the ice continent, they
stopped at a Polish research station on the way back to their ship.
   Cousteau said when he asked one of the children if he'd had a
good day, the child replied: ``Oh, it was great. They gave us
cookies at the Polish station.''
   Cousteau left Jan. 3 from Chile for Antarctica with one child
from each of the six other continents. The children, ages 11 and
12, returned to Chile on Sunday.
   The mission was meant to symbolize that ``Antarctica belongs to
future generations, not to us,'' he said.
   The Cousteau Society has joined an international initiative
sponsored by the French and Australian governments to declare
Antarctica a ``natural reserve and land of science'' and ban mining
or other industrial activities.
   Cousteau said they built an igloo _ ``a symbolic home'' _ while
there and some group members slept one night in it.
   ``The next morning we brought them a big thermos of hot
chocolate and cakes,'' he said. ``They were happy like clams.''

   Mick Jagger said ``any day now'' he'd marry Jerry
Hall. That was back in 1983, but Hall said Thursday she and the
Rolling Stone now both think it's a fine idea after two kids and 12
years together.
   ``For the first time, we both think marriage is a good thing,''
Ms. Hall told reporters at the Lyric Theater, where she will be
starring in ``Bus Stop,'' with singer Shaun Cassidy.
   The Texas-born model and actress refused to confirm that her
large diamond ring was an engagement present from the rock singer,
who is in the Caribbean.
   ``He gives me a ring like this about once a year,'' she said.
   Hall and Jagger have two children: Elizabeth Scarlett, 5, and
Leroy Augustine, 3.
   Ms. Hall appeared in ``Bus Stop'' in 1988 in New Jersey, and the
British production will open next week in suburban Watford before
moving to London in February.

   Jane Goodall, who pioneered the study of
primates in the wild, is joining the University of Southern
California faculty.
   The British ethnologist will give occasional lectures and
seminars as Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Anthropology and
Occupational Science, the university said Thursday.
   She also will take graduate students into her various programs
worldwide. Ms. Goodall, 56, who gained international acclaim during
30 years of research in Tanzania and for her close-contact studies
of wild chimpanzees, will bring the university the most
comprehensive records of animal behavior ever compiled.
   The materials represent ``really one of the most important
ethnographic resources in the world,'' USC anthropologist Gary
Seaman said.
   The facilities offered to organize her research materials was an
important factor in her decision to join USC, Ms. Goodall said.
   She was born in London and lives in Tanzania. In the early 1970s
she was a visiting professor at Stanford and served as curator of
mammals at the California Academy of Sciences from 1985 to 1987.

   Dethroned hotel queen Leona Helmsley is
free pending appeal of a four-year sentence for tax evasion, but
that didn't stop reporters from touring a prison she might get sent
to if she does have to serve time.
   Khaki-clad inmates waved at cameras and shouted advice Wednesday
for the woman who could end up their neighbor in the low- to
medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury.
   ``You're going to get a new life here,'' shouted one of the 165
female inmates. There are also about 1,100 men in the prison.
   ``It's a nice camp. No bars, no guns and she would have her
privacy and be treated as all other inmates,'' said Sylvia Jenkins,
52.
   Another inmate, Cora Cressey, 65, said the place was more like
boot camp.
   Prison officials stressed that no final decision has been made
on where Helmsley would be imprisoned if her appeal fails.
   Helmsley, convicted on 33 counts of income tax evasion, was
sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million.

   Actress Loretta Swit will help raise money for a
new play area for five ``talking'' chimpanzees, which researchers
at Central Washington University say are the first non-humans to
learn sign language.
   Swit and Gov. Booth Gardner were scheduled hosts for a $150 per
plate fund-raiser Thursday night, which was to include wild
chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall.
   The effort is for the Washoe Project at the campus in
Ellensburg, about 125 miles to the east.
   Washoe is the pioneering chimp who was the first animal ever to
learn a human language, said researcher Roger Fouts.
   The Legislature approved $1.5 million to build the chimpanzees a
new home. They had been living on the third floor of a university
building. But lawmakers didn't include money for a recreation area.
   ``Washoe hasn't seen the sun in 10 years,'' Fouts said.

<HEAD>Kohl Promise on Borders Signals Compromise to Appease Neighbors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, long vague
about the eastern border of an eventually reunified Germany,
appears to be abandoning claims to what is now Polish territory as
a means of easing European fears of German revanchism.
   A day after Kohl assured Poles that Germans do not covet
territory lost after World War II, the leader of the Free Democrats
who share power with Kohl's party called Thursday for formal
recognition of the current Polish borders.
   Kohl made his most convincing promise to date about the security
of the Polish-German border during a speech in Paris on Wednesday
before the French Institute of Foreign Relations.
   ``We want a durable reconciliation with Poland, and to that
belongs the certainty that those in Poland know that they live
within secure borders,'' Kohl said. ``No one wants a second
exiling, as the first one was horrible enough.''
   After the Nazi defeat in World War II, millions of Germans were
driven from their homelands when the territory was deeded to
Poland. About 2 million of the impoverished and defeated Germans
died during the forced exile.
   Kohl has been criticized for failing to assure Poland that its
current western border would be respected by a reunified Germany.
   Calls by some Bonn government figures for reunification within
the 1937 borders have made European neighbors fearful of a
revanchist Germany _ one that would seek to recover territory lost
with the war.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel, leader of the arch-conservative
Christian Social Union of Bavaria, is most prominent among those
West German officials to have openly coveted the lost German
territories.
   Waigel's CSU and the liberal Free Democrats under Otto Graf
Lambsdorff are the junior partners in Bonn's three-party governing
coalition.
   Lambsdorff fanned the border issue during a parliamentary debate
Thursday when he proposed that the Bundestag and the East German
parliament jointly declare recognition of the border between
Germany and Poland to be the Oder and Neisse rivers, the current
delineation.
   Kohl has contended only a formal peace treaty between Poland and
Germany could establish permanent boundaries. But he made no effort
to contradict his coalition partner during the Bundestag session he
attended.
   The chancellor said in his speech on the 50th anniversary of the
Sept. 1, 1939, Nazi invasion of Poland that West Germany holds no
claims to territory in Poland.
   But then, and again before his November visit to Warsaw, Kohl
argued he could not commit an eventually reunified Germany to the
border policies of the western state.
   Prospects for return to a single Germany have brightened
considerably over the past two months, since the Berlin Wall and
other borders were thrown open and East Germans began welcoming
closer ties with their western brothers.
   Poles and other Europeans have grown increasingly uneasy during
that time, fearing that those in East Germany and West Germany
could seek to recover the former German territories now part of
Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Kohl's speech in Paris offered no concrete promises. But its
tone and references to the horrors of exile appeared aimed at
assuring Poles and others that the border would not be tampered
with.
   ``The Germans _ and no one should doubt it _ have no intention
of starting in tomorrow's Europe a discussion about frontiers which
would necessarily compromise the order of European peace to which
we all aspire together,'' he said.
   West German newspapers on Thursday hailed the Paris speech as
Kohl's clearest signal on the unsettling border issue.
   ``Kohl gives political guarantee for the Oder-Neisse line,'' the
respected Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich heralded across the top of
its front page.
   The more conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Kohl
``stood without ifs or buts for European responsibility,'' and
correctly predicted a definitive statement on the border issue
would be avoided at the parliamentary session.

   They were evenly matched, two against two,
veteran prosecutors and defense attorneys equally obsessed with the
McMartin preschool molestation case that consumed their careers for
years.
   In the prosecution corner sat Lael Rubin, 47, English teacher
turned prosecutor whose belief in the guilt of the defendants
propelled her to push on in a case many said was unwinnable.
   Ms. Rubin, a 1978 graduate of the University of West Los Angeles
School of Law, spent nearly six years on this crusade and for half
of that time was assisted by Roger Gunson, 50, a taciturn
prosecutor who once saw his most famous defendant _ Roman Polanski
_ slip out of the country to avoid sentencing. Gunson, a graduate
of UCLA Law School, stepped in when two prosecutors bowed out in a
storm of controversy.
   On the defense side of the courtroom sat two lawyers as
different as opposite sides of a coin. Danny Davis, 43, a
Texas-born advocate with a smooth voice and an inexhaustible supply
of verbiage, represented Raymond Buckey with a zeal that bordered
on excess. He argued Buckey's innocence with the fervor of a
revival preacher and personally attacked those who opposed him.
   Davis is a former Marine Corps captain and a graduate of the
University of Texas at Austin. He handled corporate and civil
litigation but few criminal cases before he took on Raymond
Buckey's defense.
   His co-counsel, Dean Gits, 45, a Los Angeles defense attorney
since 1972, was so soft spoken that sometimes he could not be heard
in court. Gits always gave polite deference to his client, Peggy
McMartin Buckey. He fought hard in his quiet way to defend a woman
he believed was innocent.
   Overseeing the combatants was the stern Superior Court Judge
William Pounders, a legal scholar who often seemed pushed beyond
his endurance by the McMartin case.
   Once, he told participants he felt that everyone who ever
touched the case was ``poisoned'' by it. And he spoke of his own
attraction to it as ``a moth to a flame.''
   To his chagrin, the case stretched over 2{ years, becoming the
longest and costliest in U.S. history with a price tag over $15
million.
   Buckey, 31, and his mother, 63, were charged with 65 counts of
conspiracy and molestation at their family owned preschool in
Manhattan Beach. Five other defendants originally charged had their
charges dismissed after a preliminary hearing.
   Pounders' nemesis in the long trial was Davis, and he often
denounced the defense attorney's tactics. He used a computer to
keep track of how long Davis spent on each cross-examination and
scolded him for prolonging the trial.
   Once, after listening to Davis question a burly ex-felon for
five days about Buckey's purported jailhouse confession, Pounders
declared he was ending Davis' inquiry.
   ``At some point, you've got to sit down and shut up, and I'm
saying that time is now,'' he told Davis.
   ``I trust the court is not angry with counsel,'' Davis replied,
unflustered.
   ``Yes, I am,'' Pounders snapped. ``I don't want to spend the
rest of my life sitting here being bored to death.''
   Pounders, 50, was appointed to the Los Angeles County Superior
Court in April 1985 after serving almost 13 years as a deputy
attorney general and two years as a Los Angeles municipal judge.
   A Loyola Law School graduate, Pounders is regarded as a highly
intelligent jurist who has compiled a meticulously organized file
of more than 20,000 notations on index cards as references for his
rulings.

   The Alabama Senate is sometimes called
``a circus,'' and its members got into some serious clowning around
Thursday while voting to honor a real star of the big top.
   State Sen. Larry Dixon got the Senate to pass a resolution
honoring animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams, who is on his final
tour with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus after 20 years
as a star of the center ring.
   Dixon said the Senate would present the resolution to
Gebel-Williams at the Statehouse on Feb. 1 and then lawmakers would
go to a luncheon hosted by the circus, which will be appearing in
Montgomery. He said circus clowns would be at the luncheon.
   State Sen. Ann Bedsole jokingly questioned the resolution,
saying: ``An awful lot of people around the state already call us
the Alabama state circus.''
   She also questioned the propriety of having professional clowns

   Park the latest General Motors Corp. concept
truck near Waikiki Beach and someone may toss a worn-out lei in the
back. Or say ``you're welcome.''
   In a linguistic gaffe, the world's largest automaker tagged its
latest show pickup the Mahalo. In the recently ended North American
International Auto Show, GM said the word meant ``hang loose.''
   Nope. Nohea Lani Wallace, who teaches at the Center for Hawaiian
Studies at the University of Hawaii, said ``mahalo'' means ``thank
you.'' He said it often appears on trash cans in the Aloha State to
thank people for not littering.
   Now, how many guys would be willing to take their buddies
hunting in a pickup called a ``thank you.''
   ``Basically, what we found out is that we were wrong,'' a GMC
spokesman said Wednesday. He said the mistranslation originated in
the division's marketing department.
   GMC will continue to use the name when the truck makes the
rounds of future auto shows.

<HEAD>Aoun's Closes Second Newspaper, Bars Another from Christian Area</HEAD>

   Christian Gen. Michel Aoun escalated his
drive to muzzle dissent in the media Thursday by suspending the
operations of one newspaper and barring another from the Christian
enclave he controls.
   The Al-Bayrak newspaper was ordered to stop publishing for seven
days. It was the second such order by Aoun this week.
   Aoun also started legal proceedings against the newspaper for
defying a directive he issued Tuesday, which barred the media from
referring to Elias Hrawi as the president of Lebanon.
   Aoun refused to accept Hrawi's government because it was formed
as part of a peace accord that Aoun opposed.
   Until now, Lebanon's press, the freest in the Arab world, had
remained unfettered throughout the 14-year-old civil war.
   The latest measures left only the conservative newspaper
An-Anwar functioning in the Christian enclave.
   An-Anwar has adhered to Aoun's rules, calling Hrawi ``Mr. Elias
Hrawi'' and referring to the prime minister, whom Aoun also refuses
to recognize, as ``Professor Salim Hoss.'' Hoss holds a doctorate
in economics.
   The Christian region's leading daily, Ad-Diyar, was ordered
Wednesday to cease publication for a week because it defied Aoun.
   Al-Bayrak followed Aoun's order Wednesday, but on Thursday,
publisher Milhem Karam published a front-page editorial in which he
vowed to defend press freedom.
   Radio and TV stations in the Israeli-controlled zone in south
Lebanon, usually sympathetic to the Christian army commander, also
ignored Aoun.
   So did Middle East television, a branch of the Rev. Pat
Robertson's fundamentalist Christian Broadcasting Corp., which
broadcasts from the southern zone.
   Three radio stations maintained a news strike for a third day to
protest Aoun's measures.
   The army general's troops stopped a truck carrying copies of the
French-language L'Orient-Le Jour from entering east Beirut from the
Moslem sector in the west.
   An official from the distribution company said an army captain
told the truck driver, ``L'Orient-Le Jour is banned for not abiding
by the general's directives.''
   The An-Nahar newspaper, the nation's most prestigious
Arabic-language daily, did not publish for a second straight day to
protest Aoun's orders. It is published in west Beirut, but most of
its editorial staff live in the Christian enclave and commute daily.
   L'Orient-Le Jour and An-Nahar had been the only west
Beirut-based papers allowed by Aoun to sell in the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave.
   The remaining four dailies operating in west Beirut have not
been allowed into the Christian enclave for more than a year
because of their strong opposition to Aoun's policies.
   The leftist newspaper As-Safir, which operates from west Beirut,
said Aoun was ``isolating the media in east Beirut in preparation
for declaring his own state of free Lebanon in the enclave.''
   The ban, the paper said, was the ``first step in a series of
measures that the general wants to apply. He'll partition the
unions, the economy and everything in Lebanon.''
   Aoun's directive said Hrawi should only be referred to as a
former parliament deputy.
   Hrawi was elected president under a peace plan worked out by
Lebanese legislators in October. Aoun opposed the peace plan
because it did not include a deadline for the withdrawal of Syrian
troops who were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 to quell civil war
fighting.
   Aoun said the Syrians abrogated their mandate by siding with the
Moslems in the war, and he has vowed to drive them out.

   A leading Palestinian activist was accused in
court papers Thursday of giving money to a PLO-backed underground
group and supporting its plans for guerrilla attacks in Israel,
army radio said.
   In another court case, the army filed charges against Col.
Yehuda Meir, the highest-ranking officer to face trial during the
25-month-old Palestinian revolt in the occupied West Bank and the
Gaza Strip.
   Soldiers shot and wounded 17 Palestinians during stone-throwing
clashes in in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officials said. The
army said it was checking the reports.
   Palestinian Feisal Husseini was listed as an unindicted
co-conspirator in documents filed at the start of a trial of five
other Palestinians.
   A military court in Lod has charged the five, ages 19 to 35,
with forming a PLO-supported ``popular army'' unit to carry out the
orders of the underground leadership of the uprising.
   According to court documents, Husseini gave the men $450 to buy
uniforms in October.
   Military prosecutor Capt. Roni Shapira told the court that a
member of the group informed Husseini of its plans to carry out
attacks in Israel, the army radio said. Husseini voiced support for
the idea and agreed to discuss guerrilla action, but the suspects
were arrested before they could meet, court papers say.
   Husseini denied the claims. ``There is no truth to that story,''
he said in an interview.
   Husseini, 49, heads the now-closed Arab Studies Society in east
Jerusalem. He spent 18 months in Israeli prisons at the start of
the uprising but was never charged or tried.
   In recent weeks Israel has issued two orders banning him from
traveling to the occupied lands and abroad. The bans also applied
to six other Palestinians and drew a strong protest from the United
States, which said the move could hurt the Middle East peace
process.
   Husseini, scion of a large and influential Palestinian family,
is expected to play a leading role if Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks are held.
   He has said that the uprising's most pressing aim this year is
to win the confidence of Israelis who deeply distrust Palestinian
declarations of peaceful intentions.
   Earlier this week, Attorney General Yosef Harish said he will
investigate remarks Husseini made at a news conference that
allegedly supported collaborator killings.
   During the uprising, Palestinians have killed at least 170
fellow Arabs, accusing them of helping Israeli authorities.
   Another 648 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis; 43
Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Meir, who served as military commander of Nablus, the largest
town in the West Bank, is charged with ordering soldiers to beat
and break the limbs of 20 bound and gagged Arabs in January 1988,
Israel radio said.
   Troops under Meir's command left beaten and bound Palestinians
in a field until other Arabs arrived and rushed them to a hospital.
   The army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, reprimanded
Meir and gave him the choice of leaving the army or facing trial.
Meir resigned but the Supreme Court last month overturned the
military's decision not to prosecute him.
   Meir is charged with improper conduct, abuse and causing
grievous bodily harm. If convicted, he faces a prison sentence of
up to 20 years, Israel radio said.

   For the second year in a
row, tragedy in the Armenian community in the Soviet Union has
muted Christmas festivites for Armenian Christians here.
   The small Armenian community in Israel canceled some Christmas
Eve festivities Thursday because of the ethnic fighting in two
southern Soviet republics that has left dozens of Armenians dead
and thousands homeless.
   Jerusalem's Armenian patriarch, Yeghishe Derderian, accused
Moscow of not doing enough to stop the violence, in which Moslem
Azeri Turks are battling Christian Armenians in the latest round of
a protracted ethnic conflict.
   ``We condemn the negligent attitude of the Soviet authorities in
the past,'' Derderian said. He appealed to world leaders ``to act
with the utmost speed to stop the continuing bloodbath.''
   The Soviet Union sent thousands of troops to the area, but
scores of people have been killed since Saturday, many of them
Armenians who were attacked by mobs in the Azerbaijani capital,
Baku. Terrorized Armenians were fleeing the region by the thousands.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, who met with Derderian this week,
said Thursday that he offered his assistance to bring Armenian
refugees to Jerusalem. Kollek said he also sent messages to the
mayors of cities with large Armenian populations, including New
York, San Francisco and St. Louis, asking them to ``speak up and
protest the bloodshed.''
   Armenian Christians in Israel said they would mark Christmas
with religious services but not exchange gifts or hold parties. ``I
don't see any reason why we should be celebrating,'' said Nassri
Nasser, 43, a municipal employee in Bethlehem. ``It's even worse
than last year.''
   On Dec. 7, 1988, 25,000 Soviet Armenians were killed in an
earthquake, casting a pall over Christmas festivities for Armenians
in Bethlehem.
   ``We are going through a tough time,'' said George Hintlian, an
aide to the patriarch. ``We decided there will be no festivities,
only religious services.''
   The highlight of the Armenian Christmas is the midnight Mass
celebrated by Derderian in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem.
The patriarch arrived at Manger Square on Thursday, escorted by
Israeli troops and police.
   About 4,000 Armenian Christians live in Israel and the occupied
West Bank.
   The Armenian Church is one of the Eastern rite churches that are
organized along ethnic lines and accept the authority of the pope
but have considerable autonomy in ritual and questions of
discipline. Armenian Christians celebrate Christmas on Dec. 25,
Jan. 6 or Jan. 18, depending on the sect they belong to.

<HEAD>Felons' Right to Bear Arms Debated Before Maine Supreme Court</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGOR, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine voters never intended to give felons
the right to carry guns in amending the state constitution two
years ago, a state attorney told the Maine Supreme Judicial Court
on Thursday.
   But a lawyer whose client escaped prosecution on a charge of
possession of a firearm by a felon on the basis of the
constitutional amendment said its wording leaves little room for
any other interpretation.
   ``You would have to call black white,'' Daniel Bates said during
an hourlong hearing dominated by spirited exchanges between the
justices and the lawyers.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles K. Leadbetter said the trial
judge committed a fundamental error in dismissing the charge
against Edward Brown of Cumberland.
   Leadbetter said that state lawmakers, in sending the amendment
out to the voters, made clear in their statements that it was
intended simply to clarify the right to bear arms, not to supplant
any existing restrictions on who may carry guns.
   ``The Legislature expressly addressed itself to that,''
Leadbetter said, asserting that ``it makes absolutely no sense,
from logic or law'' to ignore the legislative history.
   ``What you're saying is that nothing changed'' with the passage
of the amendment, said Justice David G. Roberts.
   Leadbetter said nothing changed in the voters' perception.
   Some of the justices questioned how comments made by legislators
prior to the referendum could override its clear wording.
   ``The enactors were the people, not the Legislature,'' said
Justice Caroline D. Glassman. ``The Legislature gave its opinion.''
   Bates said Maine lawmakers could have included language stating
that certain restrictions are allowed, as about 40 other states
have done.
   The Brown case fostered an unusual alliance among the National
Rifle Association, the national Center to Prevent Handgun Violence,
the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine and the Maine Chiefs of Police
Association, all of which supported the state's appeal.
   Last July, a lower court judge dismissed a charge of possession
of a firearm by a felon against Brown, who previously had been
convicted under the state's habitual offender law for operating a
motor vehicle after his driver's license had been revoked.
   Superior Court Justice Stephen L. Perkins cited the
constitutional amendment that voters approved in November 1987 and
also found ``no rational connection'' between Brown's earlier
conviction and his possession of a firearm.
   Perkins' ruling did not affect the portion of the law
restricting the possession of guns by people convicted of crimes
involving the use of dangerous weapons.
   The amended state constitution reads: ``Every citizen has the
right to keep and bear arms, and this right shall never be
questioned.'' The amendment deleted wording that said the right was
``for the common defense.''

<HEAD>Quayle May Settle for Visiting Latin Leaders Outside Their

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, facing resistance
to proposed visits to several Latin American nations, may have to
settle for talks with some leaders outside their home countries,
administration officials indicated Thursday.
   Without going into detail, Quayle said that by the end of a
March trip to presidential inaugurations in Brazil and Chile _
following a Jan. 27 trip to the inauguration in Honduras _ he
believed ``we will have personally communicated with almost every
leader in the hemisphere.''
   However, several countries have signaled that it is too soon for
Quayle visits because of simmering resentment over the U.S.
military invasion of Panama, officials said.
   Quayle, speaking Thursday of his scheduled trip to the
inauguration in Tegucigalpa, said, ``There'll be a lot of leaders
there if we are able to work in the schedule and meet most of them.
It's not necessary just to go and pay a courtesy call'' in each
individual nation, he said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
   He is expected to carry President Bush's explanations regarding
the Dec. 20 Panama invasion, which rankled the Latin world.
   Aides said other, as yet undetermined stops are expected on the
mid-March trip to Brazil and Chile.
   Quayle said he will not meet with the leaders of Peru, Colombia
and Bolivia because Bush will see them Feb. 15 at the Colombia
summit meeting on how to fight illicit drugs.
   The vice president's aides are scheduling at least four
bilateral sessions with heads of state who attend the Honduras
inauguration, said his press secretary, David Beckwith.
   He did not specify the countries.
   Aides have said scheduling of the trip has been bogged down by
reaction from countries such as Venezuela where some officials have
said it would not be good for Quayle to come while troops remain in
Panama.
   In Caracas, Venezuela's foreign minister, Reinaldo Figueredo,
said Thursday, ``We understand he's not coming,'' but refused to
say why.
   Figueredo had said a day earlier, however, ``Maybe his visit is
not the most adequate step to be taken given the conditions that
exist with respect to the U.S. invasion of Panama.''
   Quayle on Thursday characterized the Latin response as: ``It's
not `don't come.' It's a matter of timing, when you would come.'' A
day earlier he acknowledged that ``diplomatic sensitivities'' had
come into play in planning the trip.
   The administration on Thursday tried to play down those problems
at the same time it acknowledged inability to schedule visits to
some capitals.
   ``Some of the trips ... may have to be scheduled for a later
time, but we'll continue to work on that,'' said White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``Obviously there were concerns in Latin America following the
Panama situation. Obviously there were reasons why the president
felt it was necessary to reiterate our support and our interest in
working with them,'' he said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler sought to
deflect reports that Quayle is unwelcome at this time by stating
that Bush in announcing Quayle's trip, ``did not list a specific
time; he did not list specific dates. He very clearly said how
important this region is to us.''
   Bush announced Jan. 5 he would dispatch Quayle to explain to the
Latins that he had not unleashed the U.S. military in Panama
without a rationale.
   But Quayle said his goal is not to ``go down on any
fence-mending mission, or going down to apologize, but essentially
create an understanding of how do we go about establishing a
democratic government in Panama.''
   He said he would push for countries to recognized the
U.S.-installed government of Guillermo Endara.

   A judge on Thursday denied requests for a
gag order and for questioning of grand jurors about their
objectivity in the case of a man authorities say killed 11 women.
   Attorney David Murante sought the gag order to prevent police
and other officials from commenting further on the case of Arthur
J. Shawcross. A grand jury is to begin hearing evidence Friday in
the case.
   Murante said many comments made by police and the district
attorney to the press about Shawcross have appeared to convict his
client before he is tried.
   ``I don't know how my client can ever hope to receive a fair
trial,'' he said. ``I don't see how any grand jury can hear this
case fairly.''
   But Monroe County Judge Charles T. Maloy said a gag order would
be impractical. ``There always will be sources and news leaks,'' he
said.
   Shawcross was at the hearing but did not speak.
   Murante also asked that the grand jury investigation be
postponed 45 days and that jurors be questioned individually to
determine if publicity about the case had influenced them. Maloy
denied both requests, but said he will remind jurors to base
decisions solely on the evidence.
   Prosecutor Charles Siragusa said a gag order is an extreme
measure that would have been impossible to enforce over the eight
months to a year it could take before the case comes to trial.
   Shawcross, 44, was arrested Jan. 3. He has been charged with
nine counts of murder in the deaths of nine women. The grand jury
is to review those charges as well as two other killings police
believe he committed.
   He was paroled to Rochester in 1987 after serving 15 years in
prison for the 1972 strangulation of an 8-year-old girl in
Watertown.

<TEXT>
   The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission
said Thursday it will make a decision within three weeks on
licensing the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant.
   The announcement by NRC Chairman Kenneth Carr came after the
commission listened for three hours as plant operators and the NRC
staff reported that the long embattled plant is ready to begin
producing electricity at full power. In a victory for plant
opponents, the NRC agreed to rule on several contested issues,
including emergency evacuation plans, before deciding on the
license.
   Under the schedule outlined Thursday, a decision to grant a
full-power license could mean that Seabrook would be producing
enough electricity to power a million New England homes by May.
   ``There is reasonable assurance that the plant can and will be
operated without endangering the health and safety of the public,''
the NRC staff concluded in its report to the commission. ``The
staff recommends commission approval to issue a full-power
license.''
   Thomas Murley, the NRC's director of nuclear reactor regulation,
told the commission that ``emergency preparedness at Seabrook is
adequate to support full-power operations.''
   Conceived more than two decades ago, the plant built near a salt
marsh two miles north of the Massachusetts border cost $6.4 billion
and the price tag is still rising. Seabrook has generated mass
protests by environmentalists, lawsuits by Massachusetts officials
and bankruptcy protection for its beleaguered principal owner,
Public Service Company of New Hampshire.
   According to opponents, there are three crucial issues under
dispute which the NRC must consider: whether evacuation plans are
adequate; what is the definition of ``adequate;'' and how to
resolve a disagreement between to lower-level NRC boards over
aspects of the New Hampshire evacuation plans _ aspects that
include the availability of shelter for beach crowds and the role
of school teachers in an emergency.

   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin wound
up talks with Bush administration officials Thursday saying he had
``reason to believe'' U.S. assistance to his country would hold
steady at $3 billion a year through 1991.
   But Rabin registered concern beyond next year, saying Israel's
budget is strained by a rising influx of Soviet Jews and increased
Soviet weapons shipments to Syria, Iraq and Libya.
   He also indicated that Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
unable to resolve a diplomatic impasse that is delaying Mideast
negotiations on the future of the Israeli-held West Bank and Gaza.
   ``There are still gaps that remain between the Palestinians and
Israelis,'' Rabin told Israeli reporters.
   The key question is whether the Palestine Liberation
Organization will have even an indirect role in the negotiations
that Baker hopes to launch.
   Rabin stressed Israel's budget problems, and concerns about U.S.
aid, after he saw Baker.
   ``When it comes to the Middle East the glasnost is not seen
there,'' Rabin said.
   He referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
openness, which has lowered barriers to Jews seeking to emigrate.
At the same time, Rabin said, the Soviets had increased both the
flow and quality of arms to the three Arab countries.
   ``In view of all this, we believe that we deserve the
continuation of the level of support that we get,'' Rabin said.
   Israel is the largest recipient of American foreign assistance,
receiving $1.8 billion in military aid and $1.2 billion in economic
aid out of a worldwide budget of $14.6 billion.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, apparently with the
support of the administration, proposed this week diverting about
$400 million from current recipients to Eastern Europe and Panama.
   But congressional sources said Thursday that President Bush
planned to ask Congress to boost spending on foreign aid and other
international operations by about $1.8 billion in 1991, forgoing
cuts in assistance to Israel,
   Meanwhile, it was learned the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, in an
assessment for the State Department, concluded Israel could get
along with less than the $1.2 billion it receives in economic aid.
   A U.S. official, who declined to be identified, said Ambassador
William Brown's assessment, first reported in The Washington Times,
was the sort American embassies make periodically throughout the
world.
   Still, Dole's proposal, and assertions Tuesday by the State
Department it seeks ``flexibility'' in distributing foreign aid,
has raised concerns in Israel.
   The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said
Baker had told Rabin that ``the United States has always supported
Israel and will continue to support Israel.''
   Asked if U.S. aid would be trimmed, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``I have
never heard Secretary Baker discuss any cuts for Israel or for any
other country specifically, for this year.''
   Israel's concerns go beyond 1991, however, and while there seems
little doubt U.S. aid will go to the country, the question is
whether it will be less than $3 billion.
   Rabin did not say who assured him that Israel could count on
current levels, at least through fiscal year 1991, which ends Sept.
30, 1991. But he made the statement in discussing a meeting he held
Wednesday evening with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``I believe that for this fiscal year the budget is approved,
and unless there will be cuts, which I hope will not take place,
there will be continuation,'' Rabin said. ``When it comes to fiscal
year 1991, I have the reasons to believe there will be no reduction
in the support to Israel.''
   Asked if he meant both military and economic aid, Rabin replied:
``The answer is yes.''
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, asked if it were
true that foreign aid to Israel would not be cut, responded:
``That's fundamentally correct.''
   Rabin met alone with Baker for 40 minutes. The discussion
continued in the presence of U.S. and Israeli aides for another 20
minutes.
   Asked if there was a breakthrough on the diplomatic front,
spokeswoman Tutwiler said: ``We're still working.''
   Baker has been trying for three months to arrange a meeting in
Washington with Foreign Ministers Moshe Arens of Israel of Esmat
Abdel-Meguid of Egypt.
   The main obstacle is disagreement over the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Israel seeks to preclude any PLO role in the session and future
negotiations leading up to elections on the West Bank and Gaza.
   Baker is due to meet on Friday with Abdel-Meguid, their third
session this week.

   The government Thursday called off a
national referendum on outlawing the Communist Party and reimposing
the death penalty, saying it promised the vote in a fit of near
panic and had made a mistake.
   The leadership made clear it will stick to its earlier decisions
to ban capital punishment and allow the Communist Party to be legal
_ moves that prompted huge protests one week ago.
   The governing National Salvation Front tried to appease the
angry demonstrators by scheduling a referendum Jan. 28 to decide
the death penalty issue, and by announcing a ban on the Communist
Party.
   The following day, President Ion Iliescu revoked the ban, saying
it had been a hasty decision. He said the party's fate also would
be put on the referendum.
   During a news conference announcing the cancellation, spokesman
Silviu Brucan also disclosed more abuses of deposed dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu. He said officials learned that Ceausescu had
access to dozens of ``palaces'' and villas and ran agricultural
enterprises that provided hard-to-get food items to the Communist
elite.
   The decision to call off the vote was made Wednesday night
during a meeting of front leaders.
   At that meeting, Iliescu, vice president Dumitru Mazilu and
premier Petre Roman admitted the decision to hold the referendum
was ``a political mistake,'' Brucan said.
   He said the leadership was guilty of ``almost panicky
decision-making'' under the pressure of the demonstrators Jan. 12
and added it would be impossible to arrange such a vote in such a
short amount of time.
   Brucan bristled when asked whether the decision meant the
government does not view public demonstrations as a form of
dialogue.
   Countries in the West put limits on demonstrations, he
responded, and added: ``Don't ask us to be more democratic than the
British or Americans.''
   The council agreed Wednesday that future decrees on political
matters will be discussed by the entire council before being
announced, he said.
   ``The Romanian people are learning democracy and we are learning
to govern democratically,'' he said. ``Learning presupposes (that
you) make mistakes. My hope is we will not make too big ones.''
   The front outlawed the death penalty after the Dec. 25
executions of Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who were found guilty
by a military court of genocide and of ruining Romania's economy.
   After the executions, Brucan said, ``we joined the civilized
world by abolishing the death penalty maintained by Nicolae
Ceausescu against the spirit of the Romanian people.''
   Brucan said those who led Ceausescu's regime ``will be punished
very severely ... for life.''
   The decision follows statements against the death penalty by
several European leaders who have visited Romania recently to
discuss foreign aid.
   The ban on the Communist Party was reversed because it was
``anti-democratic and against the principles of the National
Salvation Front,'' Brucan said.
   ``In the world, there is no democracy that forbids by law the
existence of the Communist Party,'' he said.
   Brucan quoted Iliescu as saying that all those who served in
high places in the Communist Party and the state under Ceausescu
``should gradually be removed.''
   But Brucan also said this policy should take into account their
``professional competence and moral character.''
   Romanian newspapers and opposition figures have complained that
several of leading members of the National Salvation Front also
were leaders under Ceausescu.
   They include Brucan and the vice president, Mazilu, who led
anti-Communist chants at the Jan. 12 demonstration. Brucan said
Mazilu apologized Wednesday night for allowing himself to be
pressured by the crowd.
   Brucan said the assets of the Communist Party ``will become the
property of the entire Romanian people and will belong to the
state.''
   These include Ceausescu's former residences in Bucharest, the
nearby resort of Snagov and the mountain resorts of Sinaia and
Predeal, which were among what Brucan termed 21 ``palaces'' the
dictator used.
   In addition, he said Ceausescu had a villa available for his use
anytime in each of Romania's 41 counties, and 20 hunting lodges.
   The ``Carpati'' trust run by the party managed 60 enterprises
with a yearly profit of $420 million, including $220 million in
hard currency, Brucan said.
   The Communist Party also controlled 45 agro-industrial
enterprises employing 80,000 people who produced 40 million tons of
meat, 20 million tons of milk and 40 million eggs each year to feed
the Communist elite, he said, besides exporting produce at a profit
of $15 million a year.
   Under Ceausescu's 24-year rule, many of Romania's ordinary
citizens endured severe hardships, incuding shortages of heat and
food, while the dictator focused on paying off the country's
foreign debt.
   A military-civilian uprising drove Ceausescu from office Dec. 22.
   Brucan said the government will now focus on organizing national
elections. The National Salvation Front proposed the election for
April, but opposition leaders want it put off at least until June
so they have more time to organize.
   A key dispute in planning the election will be whether the army,
which made Ceausescu's overthrow possible by backing the revolt,
will be allowed to sit in Parliament, Brucan said.
   He noted that Romanians have had no experience with free
elections since World War II and that the government may accept
international supervision of the vote.

<HEAD>Morris Says Error Caused Worm To Go Berserk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The worm program that disabled thousands
of computers nationwide was intended simply to enter computers, but
an error caused it to go haywire, the graduate student who designed
it testified Thursday.
   ``My purpose was to see if I could write a program that would
spread as widely as possible,'' Robert T. Morris told jurors in his
federal computer tampering trial.
   ``The worm spread on the network far faster than I expected,''
said Morris, 25, who spoke publicly for the first time about the
November 1988 attack that paralyzed an estimated 6,000 computers
linked to the Internet network.
   The suspended Cornell University student said he designed the
worm to break into Internet when questioned by federal prosecutor
Mark Rasch.
   Morris said he gathered passwords from various universities and
without permission decoded them to ensure the worm would spread
widely. He also said he took steps to make the worm harmless and
protect it from easy eradication.
   During questioning by defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni, Morris
said he included mechanisms to limit the worm's growth and
programmed the worm so it would not cause permanent damage to
existing files in computers it attacked.
   Morris said it was difficult to limit the worm's growth, and
safeguard against easy detection of the worm to stop it from
entering their systems.
   Morris thought the worm would duplicate a few times a day or
every few hours, but he made a programming error that caused the
worm to replicate wildly.
   ``Once I released it I had essentially no contacts at all (with
it). I couldn't control it,'' he said.
   Morris said he let the worm enter the Internet network through
computers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
   After releasing the worm from Cornell at about 8 p.m. on Nov. 2,
1988, he went out for dinner. When he returned about three hours
later, he said, he noticed Cornell's own computer was slow to
respond to commands.
   On finding copies of the worm in the Cornell system, he said he
knew it was spreading and was not working right. He said he started
to get scared.
   Morris said he considered sending out a second worm to track
down and destroy the first one, but decided against that after
seeing the unpredictable nature of the first worm. He also was
unsure he could get into the computer system once the worm had
begun to cripple it, he said.
   Instead, he said he called Andrew Sudduth, a friend at Harvard
University, and asked him to send a message on an electronic
bulletin board read mainly by Internet users. Morris said he wanted
to apologize for unleashing the worm and tell users how to
eliminate it.
   Sudduth testified at Morris' trial Wednesday that he eventually
did send a warning message. But it didn't show up on the computer
system for two days because the route he picked to keep his
identity a secret already was backed up with mail, Sudduth said.
   Lawyers said they expected to give closing statements Monday.
   If convicted, Morris, of Arnold, Md., faces up to five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.

<HEAD>Navy: Trident 2 Missile Problems Solved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy declared its newest and deadliest
missile program ``on track'' Thursday for a March deployment,
announcing that the problems that caused submarine-launched Trident
2 missiles to spin out of control have been cured.
   ``My confidence is fully restored that we've solved the problem
beyond a shadow of a doubt,'' Rear Adm. Kenneth Malley told
reporters at a Pentagon briefing.
   Two of the first three submarine tests of the 44-foot, $26.5
million missile, formally known as the D-5, failed when the
missiles self-destructed.
   Following two successful undersea launches earlier this week,
Malley predicted the missiles will be deployed aboard the submarine
Tennessee on schedule.
   The Navy has touted the Trident submarines and their new
missiles as the ``the most effective strategic platform in the
world today.''
   ``The Trident 2 program is now on track. ... It still looks like
it's very solid for the end of March,'' the admiral said of plans
to have the submarine armed and ready for patrols.
   The USS Tennessee will be the first of 24 subs to go to sea,
each with 24 of the weapons. The Trident 2 is capable of hurling as
many as 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more than 4,600
miles away.
   Malley said that the missile's motor nozzle system, blamed for
two test failures of the Trident 2 missile earlier this year, has
been redesigned.
   The admiral said that ``five separate fixes'' had been developed
to solve the complex problem on the 130,000 pound weapon, which
involved water entering the missile's nozzle system and a build-up
of pressure that caused elements of the direction system to fail.
That made the missile go into a pinwheel and self-destruct.
   The overall cost of the missile weapon program is $35.5 billion,
a figure that includes the planning and procurement of 871 missiles
through fiscal year 2001. Eventually, the missiles will be deployed
aboard 21 Ohio-class submarines, the Navy said.
   Greenpeace protesters tried to halt a Trident 2 launch Dec. 4 by
sending the 190-foot vessel MV Greenpeace, with 25 people aboard,
into the Tennessee's launch safety zone.
   A Navy ship intercepted the intruding vessel and damaged it by
repeatedly bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the
smokestacks, stopping the engines. Navy sailors in swift boats
corraled two Greenpeace high-speed rafts that tried to approach the
Tennessee, cut their fuel lines and towed them out of the safety
zone.
   Greenpeace had halted a Trident 2 test with the same tactics in
July.

   Opposition candidates in Nicaragua have been
subjected to intimidation and violence, the State Department said
Thursday.
   The incidents raise ``grave questions as to whether there can
truly be free and fair elections in Nicaragua'' next month,
department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   The ruling Sandinistas, she said, have violated pledges to
refrain from using state resources, including the
government-controlled media, to further their own candidacies.
   Ms. Tutwiler issued the statement after the release Wednesday of
an Organization of American States report that raised some of the
same concerns.
   OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares said in a statement that
he believes ``the electoral process in Nicaragua is coming along
normally.''
   ``This does not mean, however, that I fail to recognize that
there had been some occurrences, such as violence, the use of
television and acts of intimidation, which are reflected in the
report,'' he said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said media reports this week indicated that
Sandinista police tried to arrest the media adviser of the leading
opposition group on the grounds that his car resembled one that had
been stolen.
   Later, two Sandinista thugs threw rocks at his house, she said.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the insurance, banking and
thrift industries on Thursday promised a ``social compact'' with
the nation's distressed neighborhoods to expand by billions of
dollars the available loans and investment capital needed to
produce affordable housing.
   ``Commercial banks, thrifts and insurance companies are
committing to increase their conventional lending _ their
market-rate lending _ to low- and moderate-income borrowers and in
low- and moderate-income neighborhoods,'' said William A.
Whiteside, executive director of the Neighborhood Reinvestment
Corp. at a news conference.
   The additional private financing would be combined with
below-market rate capital from local, state and federal
governments, foundations and the NRC over the next 10 years for
single-family home purchases, Whiteside told reporters.
   The new funds would be used to expand a 17-year-old loan-buying
program administered by the NRC through Neighborhood Housing
Services of America.
   ``The savings and loans have been and are America's primary
housing financer,'' said Robert B. O'Brien Jr., vice chairman of
the League of Savings Associations and chairman of the New
Jersey-based Carteret Savings Bank.
   The thrifts have helped NHSA purchase more than $40 million in
loans in 300 low-income neighborhoods with few defaults nationwide,
O'Brien said.
   Area residents whose income equal 80 percent of a neighborhood's
median income _ about $15,000 to $25,000 in most low-income
neighborhoods _ would qualify for loans, he said.
   ``We think we can provide billions of dollars to rehabilitating
the urban neighborhoods with market-rate investments,'' said Wayne
E. Hedien, chairman of Allstate Insurance Co.
   ``This is a demonstrable coming together of private,
neighborhood and public entities to accomplish a major goal and
that's what we mean by the social compact,'' said Preston Martin,
chairman of the California-based WSGP Financial Management Co.
   The expansion program amounts to a commitment in the financial
community to help save older sections of the country's urban and
rural areas, said Martin, a former vice chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Thursday's speakers offered few specifics on how soon or how
much money would be budgeted for the program.
   However, an annual $50 million interest rate subsidy mandated by
last year's federal savings and loan bailout legislation would be
included in any final figures, O'Brien said.
   A written statement promised that a group of 20 industry
representatives, the ``Social Compact Leadership Group,'' shortly
would announce ``goals for both direct and indirect increased
lending and investment in such neighborhoods all across America
throughout the '90s.'' The group is recruiting additional program
sponsors.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some students at a Roman Catholic elementary
school are reporting to a hospital to give urine samples in what
may be the nation's first primary school drug testing program,
school officials said Thursday.
   The first of the 25 students chosen at random from the sixth
through eighth grade at St. Sabina Academy were taken by their
parents Wednesday night to Little Company of Mary Hospital for the
test, Principal Linda Bond said.
   Testing is to continue through Friday evening. A lottery to
choose a different group of students for testing will be held each
quarter of the school year.
   ``Then we wait for the results and if any kids are tested
positive they are going to be going through counseling,'' Bond said.
   Jay Miller, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Illinois, called the testing ``outrageous,'' but said it
couldn't be challenged on constitutional grounds in court because
it had been adopted by a private school.
   ``It's the first case I've heard of in this country of any
testing being done on children in this age group,'' Miller said.
``I think it's a terrible overreaction.''
   But many youngsters at the all-black school and their parents
are proud that the school may be the nation's first to test pupils
for drugs.
   ``I care about the lives of these children,'' says the Rev.
Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina's Church. ``When you talk
about rights, if a child dies on drugs, he has no rights.''
   Pfleger, who has gained a national reputation as an anti-drug
crusader, said officials doubt a drug problem exists at the school,
``but we're doing the preventative stuff to make sure we don't.''
   The Chicago Archdiocese's Office of Catholic Education rejected
a proposal by Pfleger that drug testing be introduced in all local
parochial schools, but said it wouldn't block individual schools
from introducing such programs.
   St. Sabina's school board approved the random drug test program
in November after a survey found that 210 parents favored it and
only five opposed it, Pfleger said.
   ``The overwhelming majority of parents are behind the program,
although we've encountered opposition from some parents who feel
strongly about the psychological effects and invasion of privacy,''
said parent Sheila Grace.
   Grace's 13-year-old son, Sherman, an eighth-grader at the
school, said he was glad to participate in the program.
   ``I'm proud to be a part of it because we are making history in
showing that our school wants to be drug-free,'' said Sherman, who
was to be tested Thursday.
   The school held a lottery this week in which the names of 25
students were pulled out of a container holding the names of the
school's 200 or so sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders. About 500
students attend St. Sabina, which offers classes from preschool to
eighth grade.
   Pfleger, Bond and three teachers also volunteered to be tested.
   Pfleger said the testing is only one component in the school's
comprehensive anti-drug program which also includes classroom
teaching, faculty and staff training, parent education and
community outreach.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of coal miners continued their
strikes for a third day Thursday at five mines in southern Poland,
demanding higher pay and reforms in the industry, the official PAP
news agency reported.
   The strikes are the first significant labor protest since the
Jan. 1 implementation of radical economic reforms that have sharply
raised prices but checked wage increases while trying to create a
market-oriented economy and curb inflation.
   About 6,000 workers went on strike Tuesday at the Czerwone
Zaglebie mine and another 40 at the Niwka Modrzejow mine, both in
the city of Sosnowiec outside Katowice, a major industrial center
about 185 miles south of Warsaw.
   Strikes also continued at Thorez, Walbrzych and Victoria, three
mines in Walbrzych, a city 12 miles from the Czechoslovak border,
PAP said.
   The agency reported the strike committee ``sharpened
discipline'' when some of the 130 miners began to leave the
occupation strike at the Thorez mine.
   ``To prevent this, the miners have been practically barred from
entering or leaving the mine and resuming coal mining,'' PAP
reported without elaboration.
   The miners at the Czerwone Zaglebie mine are demanding a $26
supplement to their wages for December. The miners in Walbrzych
have similar demands for higher pay, PAP said.
   All the striking miners are calling for retention of special
shopping privileges for miners, a reduction in administrative
workers in offices and no repercussions against strikers.
   The negotiations resulted in the April 17 legalization of
Solidarity after a seven-year ban and free elections in June.
Solidarity's overwhelming victory led to formation of the East
bloc's first non-Communist government.

<HEAD>Chuck Berry Sues Magazine Over Nude Photos</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with denial from publisher.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock 'n' roll pioneer Chuck Berry says
pictures of him in the altogether with female companions were
stolen, and he is suing the magazine for $10 million that published
them.
   But the publisher of the magazine, High Society, said in New
York Thursday that the pictures were purchased and the magazine has
a signed release from the seller.
   Berry considered the photos his private property, attorney
Melvin Belli said Wednesday after he filed the lawsuit in San
Francisco Superior Court.
   Berry, 63, said he had the photos taken because, ``I've seen too
many times when girls misused their relationship with fellas. I
wanted something to show everything was merry-merry.''
   Berry and his companion are posing side by side in most of the
photos. No sexual acts are depicted. Berry said the photos were
stolen in September from his business office in St. Louis and he
does not know who turned them over to High Society.
   The photos were printed without Berry's permission and the
magazine ignored requests not to print them, said Paul Monzione,
the attorney handling the lawsuit for the Belli firm.
   High Society Publisher Gloria Leonard said that the magazine
hadn't yet been served with the lawsuit documents Thursday.
   ``We legitimately purchased those photos and we have a signed
release from the party from whom we purchased it,'' she said
referring to the package of photos. Leonard refused to identify the
seller.
   High Society runs many celebrity photos, and the magazine's
attorneys are very scrupulous to ensure everything is checked out
before publication, she said.
   ``We felt that he was certainly an interesting character, an
icon of American culture, and we never (meant) to hurt him in any
way. We have great respect for him,'' she said.

   Here are some facts and figures about AZT, the drug used to
treat AIDS:
   _ AZT, or zidovudine, does not cure AIDS. It does reduce the
severity of symptoms and can prolong the lives of AIDS patients. It
also delays the onset of symptoms in those infected with the virus
who are not yet sick.
   _ It works by inhibiting reproduction of the AIDS virus.
   _ It has strong side effects including nausea, headaches and
injury to bone marrow that can make transfusions necessary during
treatment.
   _ It was the first anti-AIDS drug certified by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, which approved its use for seriously ill AIDS
patients in March 1987.
   _ It is marketed by Burroughs Wellcome Co. under the name
Retrovir.
   _ It costs between $2,700 and $6,500 per year, depending on the
dose.
   _ It is derived from herring sperm and was originally
synthesized by Dr. Jerome Horowitz in the 1960's in a search for an
anti-cancer drug. AZT failed those tests, but was revived when it
demonstrated success against the AIDS virus.
   _ The first AZT tests against the AIDS virus occurred in
February 1985, and tests on AIDS patients were performed in July
1985.
   _ AZT is now available in a new strawberry-flavored syrup that
is easier for children to swallow than capsules and allows dosages
to be adjusted for body size.

<TEXT>
   A woman described by her father as a
``poster child for compulsive gambling'' was fined $750 Thursday
for underage gambling in a pattern that stretches back four years.
   Debra Kim Cohen, who turns the legal gambling age of 21 on Feb.
8, also received a suspended 30-day sentence and a year's
unsupervised probation as part of her agreement to plead guilty to
charges of violating her probation and playing blackjack Dec. 13 in
Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino while underage.
   Municipal Prosecutor Steve Smoger said Ms. Cohen, of Ventnor,
failed to follow terms of her original probation. He said he didn't
know what more could be done for her since she will soon turn the
legal gambling age.
   Her original probation included counseling and attendance at
Gamblers Anonymous sessions, neither of which she did, Smoger said.
   ``She's now making the transition from underage gambler to
possibly compulsive gambler,'' Smoger told Municipal Judge Bruce
Weekes. ``She will have to deal with the problem as she sees fit.''
   Smoger said later that the fines are the largest ever imposed on
an underage gambler in Atlantic City.
   When Ms. Cohen was a 17-year-old high school student, she
received complimentary dinners and limousine rides from casinos in
a series of incidents in 1987. A complaint was filed in October of
that year and five casinos later paid $18,000 in fines and made
donations of $162,000 to compulsive gambling programs.
   Ms. Cohen denied outside the courtroom that she gambles
compulsively. Her father disagreed.
   ``I pray that when she turns 21 ... the excitement of the game
no longer exists,'' said Leonard Cohen, an Atlantic City police
detective. ``Kim has pretty much become a poster child for
compulsive gambling.''
   Cohen, who wrote letters to the casinos long before his daughter
was first caught, also blamed the gaming halls for weaving an
illusion they are the ``way to wealth.''
   Smoger said his investigation showed the casino acted properly.
Wayne G. Marlin, a spokesman for the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement, said the agency's investigation is continuing.
   Weekes said in sentencing Ms. Cohen that she can no longer blame
others for her problems.
   Smoger said he grew tired of hearing Ms. Cohen's reasons why she
could not attend counseling, one of which was that she felt
uncomfortable at Gamblers Anonymous meetings because she was
surrounded by older men.

<TEXT>
   The United States is considering extending
trade benefits to Czechoslovakia to help smooth the transition
there from communism to a free market economy, the State Department
said Friday.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the administration
is considering a waiver of an amendment which bars Czechoslovak
exports from entering U.S. markets at the lowest possible rates.
   The amendment, applied mostly to the Soviet bloc since its
adoption 15 years ago, is aimed at countries which restrict
emigration. It has made most of the products of these countries
uncompetitive in U.S. markets.
   One of the co-authors of the amendment, former Rep. Charles
Vanik, D-Ohio, wrote to President Bush last month and called
Czechoslovakia ``a revitalized nation'' that has ``clearly met all
the conditions'' of the legislation.
   ``The most important thing America can do (to help
Czechoslovakia) is provide an immediate, fair and equal access to
our markets,'' Vanik wrote, according to an account in Thursday's
editions of The Washington Post.
   Czechoslovakia has moved toward the establishment of a free
market economy since the collapse of the hard-line communist
government at the end of November.

<HEAD>British Move on Elephant Ivory Seen as Threat to Ban on Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British refusal to join a ban on trade in
ivory threatens the international effort to save the African
elephant from poachers, the World Wildlife Fund said Thursday.
   The United States and most other countries have joined in the
ban. Illegal slaughter of elephants has greatly reduced their
numbers in recent years.
   ``We're afraid Britain's action will collapse the whole
international agreement,'' said Dana Lauren West, a press officer
for the organization.
   ``It's a shock, a complete reversal of the British position.
They did it to protect Hong Kong's trade,'' Ms. West said.
   China is due to take Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997, but
Britain still acts for the colony in world affairs. Hong Kong is
among the leading processors of ivory.
   ``They're sitting on 600 tons of it now,'' Ms. West said.
   China opposed the trade ban from the start.
   It was to go into effect on Thursday as a result of a vote last
Oct. 17 by representatives of 103 governments meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland. All are members of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species.
   South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia also submitted
``reservations'' _ in effect exempting themselves from the ban.
They supply both raw and carved ivory. Ms. West said there was an
unconfirmed report that they are now being joined by Botswana as
well as Britain. Member countries have until midnight Thursday to
make their decisions.
   After that, environmentalists will have to get together, review
the effects of the defections amd decide what to do next, she added.
   Japan and Singapore, which had been mainstays of the ivory
trade, have so far said they are ready to go along with the ban,
Ms. West reported. The fund said in an earlier statement that
Singapore has several tons of stockpiled ivory and a flourshing
industry in carving it into goods for export.
   Ms. West said that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Wednesday transferred authority on the issue from her Environment
Ministry to the Foreign Ministry, which submitted the British
reservation.
   ``Because Britain belongs to the European Economic Community,
we're afraid it may serve as a funnel to the other countries,'' she
added.
   Goods flow with few restrictions among the 12 members of the
community, which include the main countries of Western Europe.
   ``It's appalling,'' said Ginette Hemley, head of the fund's unit
that monitors trade in wildlife.
   ``England's and China's decision ... is a green light to ivory
poachers. ... It's ironic that Great Britain, one of the first
European countries to ban ivory, is the only Western nation to
oppose the ... decision. While Japan, one of the largest consumer
countries of ivory, has remained steadfast in its promise to uphold
the ban.''

   What looked like a good buy wound up
as a good bust after police arrested two men who had advertised
stolen property at cut-rate prices on a TV shopping program, police
said Thursday.
   Dino Blanco, 18, and Frederick Hallock, 20, both of Hampton
Bays, were each charged with two counts of burglary after their
arrest, said Southampton police Detective Richard Loos.
   According to Loos, the pair called WLNG's ``Swap and Shop
Program'' on Wednesday and offered a television and microwave for a
low price. But a buyer became suspicious when the sellers insisted
on meeting in a parking lot instead of a home, the detective said.
   The buyer called police, who sent two plain clothes detectives
to meet Blanco and Hallock. The detectives determined that property
had been swiped from two homes, Loos said.

<HEAD>FAA, Airlines Huddle Over Bomb Threats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is
appealing to the nation's airlines not to go public when they
receive terrorist threats against passenger flights, an FAA
spokesman said Thursday.
   The agency plans to make its case during a meeting Friday with
industry representatives in the hope a consensus will emerge.
   The FAA called the meeting in the aftermath of the decision by
Delta and Northwest airlines to publicize recent threats against
some of their flights. The disclosures ran counter to traditional
policy in the airline industry to take threats seriously but not to
publicize them.
   FAA officials believe such publicity is counterproductive,
disruptive and serves only to boost the number of false threats, a
spokesman said.
   But Bert Ammerman, the head of an organization formed after the
bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, strongly
disagreed, arguing that airlines should tell passengers _ but not
the press _ of any threats against their flights.
   ``It is unconscionable that the FAA would be meeting with the
airlines to suppress information that is the right of every
traveling person to have, based on the circumstances that presently
exist,'' said Ammerman, a New Jersey school administrator who is
president of ``Victims of Pan Am Flight 103.'' His brother, Tom,
was among 270 people killed in the December 1988 bombing.
   Ammerman contends that telling passengers of threats is
essential because airlines cannot now provide adequate security to
protect their flights.
   ``Right now, their attitude is, ``We can't protect you, we are
not going to tell you, so therefore, passengers, please continue to
play Russian roulette,'' Ammerman said.
   Ammerman and his organization are calling for the creation of an
independent agency to increase security at airports, train security
personnel and evaluate performance.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said that in a typical year some 200
to 300 bomb threats are received of which only a tiny fraction,
perhaps ``less than half a threat,'' are genuine.
   ``Our position up to now is that such threats should not be
publicized,'' Farrar said. ``We are going to be talking with the
airline representatives about whether it is a good idea.''
   ``We know from experience that in excess of 99 percent of the
threats that are received are hoaxes,'' Farrar said. ``When
terrorists are involved they do not advertise their intentions.''
   Publicizing a threat serves only to ``gratify some kind of
urge'' and will likely lead to further threats, he said.
   Additionally, he said, making a threat public causes people to
disrupt travel plans out of what is in most cases ``needless
concern.''
   ``That is not to say that we take these threats lightly,''
Farrar said. ``They are all checked out and any measures that need
to be taken are taken.''
   Ammerman said he is not advocating that the airlines give
threats wide publicity but rather convey them privately to
passengers holding tickets on the flights involved.
   ``I'm not saying it should be given to The Associated Press and
United Press International and sent out around the world,'' he said
in an interview. ``You would be telling a lot of people that making
a threat is a fun thing to do.''
   ``I am saying that passengers should be told of the threat when
they come to the counter in the terminal, that they should be told
that measures have been taken, and then the offer should be made to
make other travel arrangements if they are not comfortable,'' he
said.
   ``You have to allow the traveling public to make a decision,''
Ammerman said.
   Doug Miller, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, said its policy
is similar to the one Ammerman suggests.
   ``We have a policy not to make any bomb threats public unless we
feel there is a specific and credible threat to a specific flight,
and then we will tell only the passengers,'' Miller said.
   ``The passengers are the only ones that are impacted by the bomb
threat and we feel they are the only ones with an absolute right to
know about the threat,'' he said.
   Miller said Northwest had planned to follow that policy in the
case of a threat to a recent specific ight between Paris and
Detroit.
   But he said news organizations learned of the threat, prompting
the airline to confirm it because ``we felt it would be naive of us
to deny it.''

   The unseasonably warm weather that washed across the eastern
half of the nation this week has been a blast for outdoor vendors
and others who have to be outside, but it put a crimp in some
winter recreation.
   ``It's such a great day,'' JoAnn Melonie said as she rushed back
from her lunch break in Camden, N.J. ``It's too nice to be inside.''
   The nice weather even forced postponement of a golf tournament.
   The 20th annual Polar Ice Cap Golf Tournament on Spring Lake at
Grand Haven, Mich., scheduled for Saturday, was postponed because
ice on the lake was getting too thin. It got into the 50s Wednesday.
   ``We're supposed to have winter and here we have spring,''
complained Crystal Shipe, a staff member with the Grand Haven
Chamber of Commerce, which co-sponsors the event. ``People are
confused by this. We should be able to play golf.''
   The week started with record highs in the Mississippi Valley,
but as cooler air moved in the record highs Thursday were confined
to the East. They included 62 at Boston and Newark, N.J.; 70 at
Baltimore; 57 at Concord, N.H.; 64 at Philadelphia, 58 at Portland,
Maine; 71 at Roanoke, Va.; and 68 at Washington.
   But as a reminder of what time of year this is, Thursday's low
in Yellowstone National Park was 22 degrees below zero.
   Catherine Geiger said The Boardwalk Peanut Shoppe where she
works on the Boardwalk in Atlantic City, N.J., benefited from extra
foot traffic drawn out of the casinos and down to the shore.
   ``Business has been great,'' she said. ``It hasn't exactly
doubled, but it's better by far.''
   The balmy temperatures also are good for the hot dog business.
   ``It's incredible, at this time,'' said Gladys Mendes, who has
been selling franks outside Newark City Hall for five years. ``Two
weeks ago: cold. No business. The people, too cold, keep in the
office.''
   The warmer air formed an inversion over parts of northern New
Jersey and New York City, trapping pollutants and creating
unhealthy conditions Thursday,for the elderly and the sick,
officials said. The New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection said there were high levels of smoke and particulates.
   Buffalo, N.Y., got 3 feet of snow during December's record cold
wave, but it was nearly all gone by Thursday because of the warm
weather. Wednesday's high was 55. But the heat wave did not disrupt
the city's Winterfest _ city officials decided in September to
cancel it because warm weather played havoc with it the last three
years.
   Out West, Denver doesn't have any snow and that concerns the
producers of the new movie ``Die Hard II,'' starring Bruce Willis,
who planned 10 days of filming in the city starting Monday.
   ``It can't be 70 degrees,'' said ``Die Hard II'' publicist Marcy
Bolotin. ``The film happens at Christmas, when it's cold and dark.
We need snow. It all depends on your weather.''
   In Minnesota, the warm spell was not enough to thaw a 42-inch
layer of frost in the soil that could prevent much moisture from
soaking into the ground during the spring thaw, weather officials
say. That deep a layer of frozen soil is as much as usually
develops during an entire winter, officials say.
   ``When spring arrives, the snow will all run off,'' said Jim
Campbell of the National Weather Service in Minneapolis.
   That's a problem because parts of the state are 40 months into a
drought.
   Thanks to modern snow-making equipment and the December cold
snap that allowed production of very thick layers of man-made snow,
many ski resorts were able to weather the warmth and keep at least
parts of their slopes open.
   Even in Georgia, Sky Valley at Dillard had three of its five
slopes open this week. The temperature hit 58 Wednesday and 500
skiers turned out, said Janie Yearwood, the resort's director of
recreational activities.
   ``We're still doing extremely well, although some people are
disappointed when they come to find out how we make snow and we
can't do it because it's not cold enough,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Turkish President Turgut
Ozal discussed Thursday the implications for NATO of the changes in
Eastern Europe and reaffirmed close U.S.-Turkish security ties.
   An administration official, who asked not to be identified, said
Bush also assured his guest that he will ```vigorously oppose'' a
pending Senate resolution to designate April 24 as a day of
remembrance for Armenians allegedly massacred by Ottoman Turks
decades ago.
   Bush, at the outset of his Oval Office meeting with Ozal,
expressed to reporters his ``delight'' with a Sen. Bob Dole
proposal to shake up U.S. foreign aid allocations and give the
White House, not Congress, more say over where the money goes.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that in the
Oval Office meeting and a private lunch, Bush and Ozal talked at
length about ``the Middle East and the sweeping changes in Eastern
Europe, with special reference to the Balkans.''
   They also discussed the conventional force reduction talks in
Vienna and ``NATO's vital role in a changing Europe,'' Fitzwater
said. Turkey plays a major defense role on NATO's southern flank
and is home to strategically important U.S. bases.
   ``The president and President Ozal agreed to continue their
pattern of close consultations and stressed the importance of
U.S.-Turkish security cooperation at this time of rapid change in
Europe and in East-West relations,'' he said.
   The two leaders also reaffirmed their support for United
Nations-sponsored negotiations to solve the Cyprus question.
   Turkey hotly disputes charges that Ottoman Turks massacred 1.5
million Armenians between 1915-23. Ozal said in a speech at the
International Club of Washington Wednesday night that, ``This is a
matter for historians, not political people'' to decide.
   A resolution designating April 24, 1990, as a day of remembrance
for the Armenians passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
last fall despite strenuous lobbying by Turkey and strong White
House objections.
   The White House source said Bush assured Ozal his administration
will ``vigorously oppose'' the resolution in its current form when
it comes before the Senate, which returns next week from a holiday
recess. Bush also indicated a willingness to work with Congress
``on a balanced resolution,'' the source said.
   Ozal met earlier Thursday with Dole, the Senate minority leader
from Kansas and author of the Armenian resolution.
   Asked if he planned to discuss Dole's proposed foreign aid cut,
Bush replied, ``I won't be talking about that. I'll be talking
about my delight that somebody understands that it's the president
that ought to set these priorities and that's why I'm very pleased
about it.''
   ``I want to see it put the power where it should be on this
matter, and not mastermind foreign policy through 138 subcommittees
allocating funds,'' Bush told reporters at the outset of the Oval
Office meeting with Ozal.
   Dole has said he will propose legislation cutting allocations to
Turkey and the four other biggest recipients of U.S. foreign aid by
5 percent to free $330 million to help the emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe.
   Dole's proposal would seek to curtail the common congressional
practice of ``earmarking'' chunks of the $14 billion in U.S.
foreign aid for specific countries and projects.
   ``I'd like to see it done the way I think the founding fathers
intended for it to be done. And don't worry about our friends,
Turkey. We will take care of that,'' said Bush.
   Ozal said Wednesday that his country would refrain from
interfering in the conflict raging in the Soviet Caucuses, and he
took pains to distance Turkey from its ethnic ties to the
Azerbaijani people.
   Ozal is on a 10-day visit to the United States that includes
meetings with the heads of the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and American investors.

civil war.
   Kimmitt hinted that the two superpowers have embraced a more
conciliatory approach to Afghan peace talks.
   While Washington still insists that Marxist President Najib be
removed, his departure is no longer seen as a prerequisite to
opening peace talks.
   Moscow has resurrected a year-old offer of a ``transitional''
government, which Washington believes means Najib's eventual
removal, Kimmitt said.
   A senior U.S. administration official said Eastern Europe's
rejection of single-party Communist rule coupled with unrest in the
Soviet Union's own republics increased pressure on Moscow to
stabilize its relations with Washington.
   Washington plans to capitalize on this to find a political end
to Afghanistan's brutal war, but one that does not include Najib,
said the official, who spoke on condition he was not identified,
   He said, however, U.S.-backed rebel fighters would likely be
willing to ``talk to elements within Kabul.'' This is seen as a
concession to Moscow, which has demanded the ruling Communist Party
take part in a postwar settlement.
   ``The resistance has indicated it is prepared to talk to
elements within Kabul,'' those they euphemistically refer to as
``good Moslems,'' he said.
   ``Their greatest hatred has been Najib and criminal elements
around him.''
   Kimmitt's three-day visit to Pakistan was part of U.S.
preparations for next month's meeting between Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Kimmitt was the highest-ranking State Department official to
visit Pakistan since last year's withdrawal of Soviet combat troops
from Afghanistan.
   He told a news conference the Soviet Union, which has sent huge
arms shipments to its communist allies in Kabul, ``is prepared to
discuss in good faith'' an end to the 11-year-old war.
   More than 1.5 million people have reportedly died in
Afghanistan's guerrilla war, which was launched in 1979 to rout
Soviet combat troops sent by Moscow to crush a burgeoning Moslem
insurgency and replace one communist government with another.
   The Red Army left Afghanistan after only managing to fight
U.S.-backed rebels to a stalemate. Najib's government was expected
to collapse within weeks of the withdrawal of more than 103,000
Soviet soldiers last Feb. 15.
   But almost a year later, Najib controls all of Afghanistan's
major cities and the rebels control most of the countryside.
   Washington has shipped millions of dollars worth of weapons to
the anti-Marxist rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic
holy warriors.
   But bitter internal feuding among rebel leaders, headquartered
in Pakistan, has paralyzed a so-called guerrilla government. Many
Afghans and Western observers say the rebels have failed miserably
on the political front, unable to attract minority groups or rebels
living in Iran to their self-styled government.
   But the senior U.S. official noted that Moscow dug up its offer
of a transitional government while Kabul's ruling communists had
the upperhand in the civil war. He said this may mean Moscow is
ready to talk, despite the rebels' shortcomings.
   Western diplomats say the Soviet Union spends about $300 million
a month supplying Afghanistan with arms and humanitarian aid.
   On Wednesday the guerrillas unveiled a complicated formula to
select a new leadership. The announcement, made to coincide with
Kimmitt's visit, fails to unite the fractious rebel leadership, or
include those living in Iran.
   Hard-line Islamist Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, leader of Hezb-i-Islami
rebel group, dismissed the formula, demanding elections instead.
   Kimmitt refused to comment on the proposal but was expected to
meet with guerrilla leaders in the border city of Peshawar before
leaving for New Delhi.

   A national retailer is recalling more than
1,000 electric garment steamers that present a possible burn hazard
to users, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.
   The agency said the J.C. Penney Co, Inc., voluntarily recalled
the steamers after consumers reported that the locking mechanism on
the fill plug can be broken during use.
   Breaking the locking mechanism can cause the fill plug to pop
out, releasing hot water and steam onto the user, the commission
said.
   At least five people have suffered first and second degree burns
to their hands, arms, face or other parts of the body in incidents
involving the steamers, the commission said.
   Consumers can return the approximately 1,100 steamers sold since
August 1988 and marked JCP Lot No. 784-1008 to any J.C. Penney
store for a full refund.

<HEAD>U.S. Would Buy Coca Crop Under Peruvian Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States would provide aid to help
buy Peru's coca leaf crop under a plan proposed Thursday by the
Peruvian ambassador.
   Cesar Atala Nazal said Peruvian farmers ``would dream to be on
the side of the law'' even if it meant earning slightly less by
growing other crops. The coca leaf is used to make cocaine.
   Growers in the Upper Huallaga Valley face continual harassment
from both police and drug traffickers, Atala said, adding that the
growers' share of the huge profits from the drug trade is very
small.
   Atala said the Upper Huallaga Valley produces 180,000 metric
tons of leaves with an average price of $1,300 a ton. The average
farmer in Peru, he said, does not make more than $1,000 a year.
   The purchase plan would last only a few years, until crops could
be substituted and other economic improvements are made.
   Payments to the farmers _ about $234 million for one year's
worth of crops _ would find their way into the economy as well,
Atala said, noting that last year's drug-fighting aid totaled $254
million.
   ``I am absolutely convinced that the farmers themselves would
profit by getting this money but working within the law rather than
continue being the victims of traffickers, the terrorists and the
Peruvian police,'' he said at a news conference.
   Atala offered the proposal at a joint hearing of the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the Senate Caucus on International
Narcotics Control.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, said the proposal sounded feasible but doubted many
would favor it. He said it would have to be done in conjunction
with operations against traffickers and producers.
   Ambassador Jorge Crespo Velasco of Bolivia also supported the
proposal.
   Most of the cocaine that enters the United States comes from
Peru, Bolivia and Colombia. Representatives of those three
countries will meet with President Bush at a Feb. 15 drug summit in
Cartagena, Colombia.
   Also at the hearing, Atala reiterated criticism of last month's
U.S. invasion of Panama. Atala and Colombian Ambassador Victor
Mosquera Chaux said at a news conference that participation by U.S.
warships in drug interdiction efforts off the Andean nations'
waters is unwelcome and unnecessary.
   ``What your armed forces could do, we could do if necessary,''
Atala said.
   Mosquera Chaux said ``U.S. naval forces could begin by trying to
control the entry of narcotics within their own waters.''
   Biden called Thursday's hearing to gather comment on his
proposed debt-for-drugs legislation, under which the United States
would exchange debt relief for anti-drug efforts by drug-producing
countries.
   The proposal is modeled after similar notions of exchanging debt
for equity or debt for protection of natural resources. Biden
acknowledged that the administration was cool to the idea, but said
he hoped it would be included on the summit agenda next month.
   The three ambassadors told the panel that the drug trade was
inextricably bound with other economic problems, some of which they
blamed on the United States.
   Mosquera Chaux proposed a one-time grant of $1 billion to offset
the economic consequences of the war on drugs and the breakdown of
an international coffee agreement he said will cost Colombian
growers $600 million this year.

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three U.S. technicians working for
Lockheed Aircraft Corp. hope to leave Chad early Sunday after being
detained for two weeks, a negotiator for the company said.
   Len R. Webb, Lockheed's regional manager for Africa and the
Middle East, said Thursday it was possible the three will leave
N'Djamena for Paris early Sunday on an Air Afrique flight.
   The three _ Irving Thrash, Marvin Gambill and Ernest Ruse, all
from the Atlanta area _ refused comment other than to say they
would be glad to leave the North African country.
   They remained under house arrest Thursday at N'Djamena's largest
hotel, the Hotel Tchadienne, part of the French-owned Novotel hotel
chain.
   Police took the men into custody Jan. 5, releasing them only
last Monday on condition they not leave the hotel while Lockheed
negotiated their freedom with the Chadian government. Their
passports also were confiscated.
   Webb has termed the detention a ``misunderstanding'' that
involved the destruction of a manual for a Lockheed C-130 military
transport aircraft purchased for the Chadian air force.
   It was the first Lockheed plane _ of several in use in Chad _
that was purchased new by President Hissene Habre's government.
   The contract called for a team of three technicians from the
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems-Georgia subsidiary to be stationed in
Chad for a year to teach the Chadians how to maintain the plane.
The year ended in December.
   Webb said the dispute was over a single ``high-level technical
overhaul document'' not needed for day-to-day maintenance. The
technicians destroyed the document as they prepared to leave Chad,
but the Chadians thought it was sold with the plane.
   Lockheed did not have the State Department's export permit for
the document, Webb said, but authorization now has been obtained
and the Chadians provided with a new copy.
   Chadian authorities are believed to have since made maintenance
arrangements with another company.
   Webb, who is based in Amman, Jordan, says the three technicians
were not held hostage and have not been mistreated or harassed.
   Lockheed headquarters are in Calabasas, Calif.

<TEXT>
   The Republican Party's internal debate over
abortion boiled into the open Thursday, with a party committee
refusing to consider a resolution affirming the GOP's fervent
anti-abortion stance.
   The action came on the opening day of the Republican National
Committee's winter meeting, a session dominated by public and
private discussions about whether the party should moderate its
official stand on abortion as 1990 elections approach.
   The session also included a complaint from the leader of a black
GOP group, who said despite minority outreach commitments from
party chief Lee Atwater some state chapters ``overlook'' blacks.
   Fred Brown, head of the National Black Republican Committee,
also said that while he has been unable to organize a presidential
dinner as an organization fund-raiser, Jesse Jackson and other
prominent black Democrats ``constantly meet with the president.''
   But abortion overshadowed other topics as the RNC convened in a
hotel blocks from the White House.
   One RNC member, Idaho state GOP Chairman Randy Ayre, sought to
offer a resolution endorsing the party's 1988 platform recognition
of the ``sanctity of life.''
   Ayre was told that his request would not be considered because
he had not submitted a formal resolution in advance of the
gathering and that perhaps the issue would be discussed at the next
RNC meeting in June.
   ``But we have elections coming up,'' he said, to no avail,
during a meeting of the RNC's resolutions committee.
   Ayre said after the session, taking a stance similar to that of
Atwater, that he personally opposes abortion and believes the party
should, too, but that the GOP should not use a candidate's position
on abortion as a litmus test for party support.
   Still, he said: ``I just feel that we should reaffirm the
party's longstanding position on the issue.''
   Ayre appeared uncomfortable speaking to reporters about his
attempt, and an impromptu session with several ended abruptly when
an Atwater deputy summoned him out of the room with a message that
he had a telephone call.
   Atwater and other prominent Republicans _ including Bush and
Vice President Quayle _ have sought in recent months to portray the
GOP as an umbrella organization that welcomes candidates with
varying views on abortion. And, mindful of the role abortion played
in several major elections won by Democrats last year, Atwater has
been urging Republican candidates to state their position on the
issue early and firmly to attempt to diminish abortion's campaign
role.
   The party chairman has been criticized by some in the GOP's
conservative wing who believe the party should hold firmly to its
anti-abortion stance. Atwater aides said he would dedicate a good
portion of his Friday speech to the issue, giving what one called
``a better version'' of how he feels candidates should deal with
the topic. He also participated in a lengthy discussion about
abortion politics at a private luncheon with RNC members, sticking
to his theme that the party is a ``big tent'' with room for
differing opinions.
   Even some staunchly anti-abortion RNC members said privately
they would have difficulty supporting a resolution such as Ayre's
because of the problems such a stance might cause some GOP
candidates.
   ``Those who are pro-life can point to the 1988 platform and
those pro-choice can point to the president's remarks about
inclusion,'' said one RNC member privately. ``It does us no good to
stir this thing up.''
   Ayre, in his brief session with reporters, disagreed, saying he
proposed his resolution ``because of the timeliness of the issue.''
   Another member of the resolutions committee, Iowa national
committeeman Stephen Roberts, said the decision to quash Ayre's
request would only delay an inevitable _ and difficult _ decision
by the party.
   ``It's clearly an issue,'' he said.
   Roberts said he wanted to speak to other members before deciding
what tack he would encourage the party to take. He and others said
abortion was a major topic in conversation and private sessions of
the meeting.
   He also joined Ayre in saying RNC rules need to be improved so
that resolutions considered at party meetings are meaningful.
   ``God, motherhood and the flag'' was how he summed up the
committee's business, which included passage of resolutions
praising the Bush administration, pro-democracy movements in
Eastern Europe and the invasion of Panama. ``If you're going to
have any meaning to it you've got to deal with the issues of the
day,'' he said.
   Other members, however, were more comfortable leaving the
abortion debate off the public agenda except at presidential
nominating conventions _ and perhaps even then.
   ``This is an issue of conscience,'' said Haley Barbour, an
anti-abortion RNC member from Mississippi and a key GOP strategist
in the South. ``Not everyone has to agree with me.''
   A sign of the party's reluctance to debate abortion publicly
came when the resolution committee considered suspending its rules
to consider a resolution from the RNC's Puerto Rico delegation that
was not submitted by the deadline. The resolution was virtually
identical to a GOP platform plank endorsing statehood for Puerto
Rico if its residents voted in favor of such a move.
   RNC member Elsie Hillman of Pennsylvania, at Barbour's
suggestion, ruled the motion out of order after saying agreeing to
consider it ``would make it harder to deny any other resolutions
brought to us at the last minute.''

   A group representing the nation's largest
corporations criticized congressional proposals to clean up air
pollution Thursday as being too expensive and said some of the most
stringent provisions could force plants to shut down.
   The Business Roundtable, an association of 200 major
corporations, presented a study it commissioned that maintained
that legislation before Congress to tighten the federal Clean Air
Act could cost business $54 billion to $104 billion a year.
   The cost figures were sharply higher than any that have surfaced
so far in the debate over the legislation, which has been given a
high priority by congressional leaders and the White House. Senate
floor debate on a clear-air bill was to begin next week.
   Administration officials called the business group's cost
predictions too high. Environmentalists said the estimates were
inflated.
   ``This is part of an industry ritual on the eve of any pollution
control debate in Congess. They release inflated figures,'' said
Richard Ayres of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
   Earlier Thursday, President Bush renewed his call for Congress
to ``break the stalemate'' and pass clean-air legislation as soon
as possible. Aides have said privately for weeks that Bush would
like to have a toughtened air pollution bill in hand to sign as
part of Earth Day celebrations in April.
   Bush, speaking to administration officials, urged Congress to
``preserve the careful balance'' of legislation he proposed last
summer ``to clean up the air and preserve jobs.''
   The administration has estimated the cost of the Bush proposal
as between $14 billion and $19 billion a year. The cost to industry
of a similar version advancing in the House has been put at about
the same level, but administration officials have opposed parts of
a Senate bill because they claim it would be more expensive and
possibly threaten economic growth.
   Earlier this week, staff members of the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee disputed claims that the Senate bill would
add significantly to the cost of legislation proposed by the
president.
   A spokesman for Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chief sponsor of the
Senate bill, called the Business Roundtable cost estimates far too
high and said the Senate bill's costs ``are comparable to the
president's proposal.''
   According to the Commerce Department, air pollution control
measures currently cost business and industry an estimated $32
billion a year.
   But the study presented by the Business Roundtable said a ``best
estimate'' of complying with provisions of the Senate bill would be
an additional $54 billion a year and could soar as high as $104
billion if businesses were required to meet the toughest
health-based standards suggested by the legislation for toxic
chemical emissions.
   Dale Denny, author of the report, said compliance with stringent
health-based toxic emission controls from industrial plants could
add from $25 billion to $62 billion onto the cost of compliance if
companies were required to curb emissions to levels that pose no
more than a 1 in 1 million cancer risk.
   The Senate legislation calls for such risk levels to be a
``goal'' but would allow regulators to issue exemptions and set
less stringent limits if economic or technological conditions
warrant.
   Philip Masciantonio, vice president for environmental affairs
for U.S. Steel Corp., said, however, that the toxic chemical
controls in the Senate bill could result in ``reduced industrial
production, job losses, employment dislocations and possibly
shutdowns of industries.''
   The steel industry's coke oven operations are threatened by the
Senate bill because they would be unable to meet some of the
standards envisioned by that bill, he said.

<TEXT>
   The Shiite Moslem Amal militia
on Thursday displayed an underground prison where it said U.S.
Marine Col. William Higgins was briefly held before his reported
death.
   Melhim Qanso, Amal's spokesman in south Lebanon, said the
seven-cell prison, dug behind a car painting shop in this southern
village, was used by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah ``to hold innocent
victims, including foreign hostages.''
   ``Higgins was held here for three days shortly after his
abduction,'' Qanso told reporters.
   He said Amal has arrested an underground Hezbollah network in
Kawthariet Assiad, 11 miles southeast of the port of Sidon.
   ``Its members confessed that Higgins was here,'' Qanso said.
   Higgins, who headed a U.N. observer team in south Lebanon, was
kidnapped near the southern port of Tyre Feb. 17, 1988. The
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed it killed him last
July after Israel kidnapped a Hezbollah sheik.
   U.S. intelligence officials believe Higgins, of Danville, Ky.,
was killed a year earlier in retaliation for the downing by an
American warship of an Iranian Airbus in the Persian Gulf, killing
260 people.
   Hezbollah is the umbrella group for several pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem factions holding most of the 18 Western hostages _ including
eight Americans _ in Lebanon.
   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped off a Beirut street on
March 16, 1985.
   Qanso said blood stains littered the cells upon discovery of the
dusty prison by Amal's security apparatus last week.
   The two-foot-thick concrete door is concealed behind shelves,
where a few paint canisters were lying.
   Qanso led journalists through the narrow corridor to a series of
air-conditioned cells equipped with iron doors that had a small
opening with shutters Amal said were used to pass food.
   Weapons, including Israeli-made silencer-equipped Uzi submachine
guns and mortars, as well as mines, were displayed in an Amal
ammunition depot in the adjacent village of Insariyeh. Qanso said
the weapons, which belong to Hezbollah, were found in the prison.
   He also showed torture equipment including ropes, chains and
whips that he said were discovered in the jail.
   Qanso said two members of the network were executed for plotting
to assassinate Amal's chieftain Nabih Berri recently. He refused to
disclose further details.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting each other intermittently
since 1987 for mastery of the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's
largest sect. By police count, 929 people have been killed and
2,744 wounded in the confrontation.

   Some tour packages being offered for the Super
Bowl don't include a ticket to the game, the Transportation
Department warned Thursday.
   The department's consumer affairs office said that if a ticket
to the National Football League's Denver-San Francisco extravaganza
in New Orleans on Jan. 28 is not specifically mentioned in an
advertisement for the package, or is not listed as a feature of a
tour package, it probably is not included.
   Fans should read promotional material carefully, the department
said.
   And it advised paying by credit card, ``which provides some
degree of protection under fair credit practice laws.''
   The department said that Super Bowl packages involving public
charter flights offer some clear advantages.
   ``If the charter tour is supposed to include a game ticket and
you do not receive one, you are entitled to a full refund of the
entire package price when you return,'' it said.
   Customers may also cancel travel arrangements and receive a full
refund if there is a change in the cities where flights originate,
if a hotel not named in the brochure is substituted or if a price
increase of more than 10 percent is imposed, it said.
   In order to avoid being turned away at the loading gate because
of check-in time limits imposed by both scheduled and charter
airlines, the department advised Super Bowl fans to get to the
airport well ahead of time.

   Former leader Todor Zhivkov was put under

reported Thursday.
   The state agency also said opposition talks with the ruling
Communists broke down Thursday over access to Bulgaria's
broadcasting networks.
   The prosecutor-general's office issued a warrant for the deposed
dictator, who was toppled in a November uprising, charging Zhivkov
with malfeasance in office, inciting ethnic hostility and misuse of
state property.
   The 78-year-old Stalinist was not jailed, according to BTA, but
was instead put under guard at an undisclosed location.
   That makes him the second East Bloc leader now under official
investigation for abuses disclosed by the upheavals that have
convulsed Eastern Europe. Former East German party leader Erich
Honecker, now hospitalized, faces a charge of high treason.
   The charges against Zhivkov indicate he is being personally
blamed by his reformist Communist successors for the nation's
severe ethnic and economic problems.
   Zhivkov was the author of so-called ``Bulgarization,'' the
persecution and forced assimilation of the nation's 1.5 million
ethnic Turks and other native Bulgarian Muslims, known as Pomaks.
   After his ouster, Zhivkov was accused of corruption when it was
revealed he had maintained at least 30 holiday and hunting retreats
throughout this poor Balkan nation.
   Zhivkov's often-violent forced assimilation policy banned Moslem
religious practices and required ethnic Turks and Moslems to
forsake their own names and take Bulgarian ones.
   Most of Bulgaria's 9 million people belong to the Bulgarian
Orthodox Church.
   More than 300,000 ethnic Turks emigrated to Turkey to escape the
harsh Bulgarization campaign, but about 80,000 later returned,
citing lack of jobs and housing in Turkey.
   The talks with the reformist government of party chief Petar
Mladenov have foundered over the government's refusal to allow the
opposition to use the electronic media to spread its democratic
message throughout this mostly rural nation in advance of promised
national elections.
   ``We are left with the impression that the delegation of the
official authorities has no intention to carry (out) serious
negotiations,'' said the Union of Democratic Forces, the umbrella
grouping of opposition organizations, according to a statement
carried by BTA.
   Western diplomats said if the opposition and government liaison
groups come to agreement on their differences, another negotiating
session is likely Jan. 22.
   Earlier this week, the Communist Party agreed to allow the
opposition to publish its own newspaper and promised it office
space.
   Faced with the plummeting fortunes of the Communist Party in
other Eastern European states, Bulgaria's Communists appear to be
trying to preserve as much power as possible, and their total
control of radio and television is key to that power.
   The government-run media continues to attack opposition leaders
in a clear attempt to discredit them with any potential electorate.
   The government has proposed two-stage legislative elections in
May and November. However, opposition figures claim May is too soon
for them to organize an effective election campaign.
   During Thursday's session of the talks, the Communist delegation
leader, Andrei Loukanov, issued a thinly-veiled warning against
anti-Communist activities, saying, ``the revival of anti-Communism
would be dangerous for the transition to democracy,'' according to
BTA.
   Loukanov was referring to anti-Communist slogans at Sunday's
pro-democracy demonstration in the capital Sofia by more than
50,000 people, one of the largest demonstrations in recent
Bulgarian history.
   The demonstration testified to the fast-growing popularity of
the opposition, which had been banned until Zhivkov's ouster.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: No More Plea Bargaining in Marcos Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lead prosecutor in the racketeering case
against Imelda Marcos said Thursday that plea-bargain discussions
with her lawyers have been suspended.
   ``We're going to trial,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles
LaBella told reporters at federal court in Manhattan, where the
trial of the widow of former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
is scheduled to begin March 13.
   Last month, Mrs. Marcos's lawyers said that during
plea-bargaining talks held in California it was recommended that
Mrs. Marcos plead guilty to mail fraud and obstruction of justice
and agree to return millions of dollars to the Philippine
government. In return, she would receive a suspended jail sentence.
   But the prosecutor said Thursday that no discussions about a
plea bargain for Mrs. Marcos were currently being held.
   LaBella declined to comment on statements by Philippine
government officials that he had told them that Mrs. Marcos's
lawyers had failed to respond to the plea offer by the government's
deadline on Monday.
   Calls to lawyers for Mrs. Marcos were not immediately returned.
   Mrs. Marcos and her husband, who died last September, were
indicted in 1988 on charges of embezzling $106 million from the
Philippine treasury and fraudulently borrowing $165 million from
American banks.
   Mrs. Marcos, who is living in Hawaii, pleaded innocent to the
criminal charges and has been free on $5 million bond. Her husband
was ousted in the February 1986 uprising that propelled Corazon
Aquino into the presidency.

<HEAD>British Move on Elephant Ivory Seen as Threat to Ban on Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British refusal to join a ban on trade in
ivory threatens the international effort to save the African
elephant from poachers, the World Wildlife Fund said Thursday.
   The United States and most other countries have joined in the
ban. Illegal slaughter of elephants has greatly reduced their
numbers in recent years.
   ``We're afraid Britain's action will collapse the whole
international agreement,'' said Dana Lauren West, a press officer
for the organization.
   ``It's a shock, a complete reversal of the British position.
They did it to protect Hong Kong's trade,'' Ms. West said.
   China is due to take Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997, but
Britain still acts for the colony in world affairs. Hong Kong is
among the leading processors of ivory.
   ``They're sitting on 600 tons of it now,'' Ms. West said.
   China opposed the trade ban from the start.
   It was to go into effect on Thursday as a result of a vote last
Oct. 17 by representatives of 103 governments meeting in Lausanne,
Switzerland. All are members of the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species.
   South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia also submitted
``reservations'' _ in effect exempting themselves from the ban.
They supply both raw and carved ivory. Ms. West said there was an
unconfirmed report that they are now being joined by Botswana as
well as Britain. Member countries have until midnight Thursday to
make their decisions.
   After that, environmentalists will have to get together, review
the effects of the defections amd decide what to do next, she added.
   Japan and Singapore, which had been mainstays of the ivory
trade, have so far said they are ready to go along with the ban,
Ms. West reported. The fund said in an earlier statement that
Singapore has several tons of stockpiled ivory and a flourshing
industry in carving it into goods for export.
   Ms. West said that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
Wednesday transferred authority on the issue from her Environment
Ministry to the Foreign Ministry, which submitted the British
reservation.
   ``Because Britain belongs to the European Economic Community,
we're afraid it may serve as a funnel to the other countries,'' she
added.
   Goods flow with few restrictions among the 12 members of the
community, which include the main countries of Western Europe.
   ``It's appalling,'' said Ginette Hemley, head of the fund's unit
that monitors trade in wildlife.
   ``England's and China's decision ... is a green light to ivory
poachers. ... It's ironic that Great Britain, one of the first
European countries to ban ivory, is the only Western nation to
oppose the ... decision. While Japan, one of the largest consumer
countries of ivory, has remained steadfast in its promise to uphold
the ban.''

<HEAD>Few Soviet Citizens May Be Classified Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Only 5,000 to 10,000 people from among 400,000
or more Soviet citizens wishing to leave the Soviet Union for the
United States will be accorded refugee status this fiscal year, the
nation's top immigration official said Thursday.
   Gene McNary, Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, also said he expects an increase in the number of
Armenians seeking refugee status or asylum in the United States as
a result of the violence against them in the Soviet republic of
Azerbaijan.
   Dozens of Armenians have been killed in the fighting which has
escalated in recent days to civil war proportions.
   ``My guess is, it'll increase the numbers'' of Armenians seeking
to come to the United States, McNary said at a news conference.
   As many as 2,000 Armenians could be allowed into the United
States each month under a category known as humanitarian parole,
which entitles them to some federal assistance but not to automatic
citizenship. About 12,000 Armenians came here last year.
   McNary said 40,000 to 45,000 of the 50,000 refugee slots
allocated by Congress for Soviet refugees in the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1 will be reserved for applicants already waiting in
Italy. These applicants left the Soviet Union last year and applied
in Rome for permission to enter the United States as refugees.
   The Rome channel was shut off by the Bush administration as of
Oct. 1 under a new system which only allows Soviets to apply in
Moscow. But Attorney General Richard Thornburgh pledged to clear up
the backlog in Rome before closing down the transit facility there
this year.
   Classification as a refugee is desirable because admission to
the United States is done outside the regular immigration quotas
and the U.S. government pays for travel and resettlement, and the
refugees may become citizens.
   The new system does not automatically assume, as previous policy
did, that Jews leaving the Soviet Union are entitled to refugee
status, which the United States grants people with a ``well-founded
fear of persecution'' on religious grounds. Instead, consular
officers have to investigate individual cases.
   The shortage of slots for Soviet refugee applicants, the vast
majority of whom are Jews, has become acute over the past year with
a lifting of many previous restrictions on the emigration of Jews,
Armenians and Evangelical Christians.
   After years of demanding the Kremlin allow more Soviets to
leave, the United States is now faced with exit permits far
outstripping U.S. budget ability to take in the emigres.
   More than 71,000 Jews left the Soviet Union last year, the
highest annual rate ever, and 36,147 of them came to the United
States as refugees.
   Jewish community officials say at least 100,000 additional
Soviet Jews have applied to leave and are waiting to be processed
by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. McNary said as many as 300,000 more
could apply in the coming months.
   McNary said the INS was increased its staff in Moscow to 24, and
had begun operating an office in suburban Washington to help in the
processing of the Soviet applications.
   On another matter, McNary said the INS had received 3,720
applications from Chinese studying or working in the United States
for permission to stay here in light of the repression against
pro-democracy movements in China. Of these, more than 2,800 have
been approved, he said.

<HEAD>Discount Chain's Founder Undergoes Cancer Therapy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Walton, the 71-year-old founder of
the Wal-Mart discount chain empire, has undergone treatment for
bone-marrow cancer, a company spokesman said Thursday.
   Walton, once the richest person in America, has received two
sessions of chemotherapy and some radiation therapy since Sunday
for multiple myeloma, said Don Shinkle, a Wal-mart spokesman.
   Myeloma is a malignant tumor in the bone marrow. It is generally
made up of abnormal plasma cells.
   A Wal-Mart statement said Walton was expected to recover fully
from treatment he underwent in Houston at M.D. Anderson Hospital.
   It is the second time Walton has faced cancer. In 1982, he was
diagnosed as having leukemia and also was treated at M.D. Anderson.
The leukemia has been in remission for several years.
   ``Along with Mr. Sam's doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the statement said.
   ``His doctors have advised him that they have had good success
treating this type of cancer if it's detected in time,'' Shinkle
said. ``He's in very good spirits.''
   Shinkle said Walton probably would spend another couple of weeks
in Houston. ``The bottom line, we hear from the doctors, is that
they caught this in time, in the early stages,'' he said.
   Walton had experienced aches and pains for several months, but
felt better after the therapy, Shinkle said.
   ``I feel so much better already,'' Walton said in a two-page
memo to Wal-Mart employees.
   Shinkle said the memo was issued because Walton wanted employees
to hear news of his illness from him, ``rather than have them to
hear a lot of rumors, because many might be exaggerated or untrue.''
   Shinkle said Walton may be initially slowed down, but that he
expects to resume visiting outlets in a few weeks, a common Walton
practice. After this week's treatments, Walton visited a Sam's
Wholesale Club in Houston.
   Walton has been known to drop in on local Wal-Mart managers with
little advance notice to stay in touch with the retail business at
the customer level.
   The memo also described Wal-Mart accomplishments during the
1980s, which Walton credited to the employees of the chain's 1,300
stores. It said Walton looked forward to more success.
   Based on his holdings of Wal-Mart stock, Walton has been listed
for the past several years by Forbes magazine as one of the
wealthiest men in the nation. He was the wealthiest until he split
his stock among family members.
   Walton stepped down as chief executive officer of the retail
chain in 1988, and chose David Glass to oversee the chain.
   The chain blossomed under Walton's philosophy of tight
management and general marketing principles that the customer is
always right.
   Born in Kingfisher, Okla., Walton grew up as the son of a
farm-mortgage banker. He graduated from the University of Missouri
with an economics degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a
management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa. After serving three years
in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin
five-and-dime. In 1962, Sam and his brother James L. Walton, opened
the first Wal-Mart Discount City.
   Three of his four grown children are involved with the company
in various capacities.

<HEAD>Battleships Iowa and New Jersey Candidates for Mothballs</HEAD>

   The Navy will propose that the U.S.S. Iowa and
New Jersey, two of its four battleships, be mothballed as a
cost-cutting maneuver in the next Pentagon budget, Defense
Department sources said Thursday.
   All four warships have become targets of budget-cutters on
Capitol Hill and elsewhere, but Navy brass _ and the lawmakers from
some states where the ships were to be based _ have been fighting
to retain the decades-old vessels.
   ``It's going to be proposed,'' one military source said
Thursday. ``It's going to be the Iowa and the New Jersey.''
   Another Pentagon official, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that while political pressure could result in a
reversal of the decision the action ``seems to be a fait accompli.''
   ``I haven't seen the final paperwork on it, but it's as good as
done,'' the official said.ck Cheney that it must trim programs in its
1991 spending plan.
   President Bush is slated to send the budget to Congress on Jan.
29.
   Under a plan attacked by critics as pure pork-barrel politics,
the Navy planned to place the battleships at four bases around the
country.
   The Iowa was slated to be at a new, $300 million base on Staten
Island in New York City, while the New Jersey is at Long Beach,
Calif. Plans call for the Wisconsin to be based at Corpus Christi,
Texas, and the Missouri at a West Coast base, as yet undecided.
   The officials said they had no indication what would happen to
the facilities lined up for the homeports, although the second
official indicated that other ships might be sent to placate local
officials concerned about job cutbacks or economic impact.
   Some New York politicians continued to voice hope that the
Staten Island base would survive, even in a stripped-down state.
   ``My gut feeling is the homeport is going to survive,'' said
Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense,
disagreed.
   ``I think it's dead,'' said Korb, director of the Brookings
Institution's Center for Public Policy and Education.
   The New Jersey and the Iowa are the older ships, launched in
1942 during World War II and entering service the next year. All
four ships saw action in that war, served through the Korean War
years and were mothballed in the 1950s.
   The four ships were reactivated starting in 1982, despite
criticism they would be extravagantly expensive to operate because
of the large crews needed _ 65 officers and 1,453 enlisted men each.
   If the New Jersey, which fired at targets in Lebanon in 1983, is
returned to the inactive fleet, it will be for the third time. The
ship also was used and deactivated during the Vietnam War.
   The ships carry 16-inch guns, Tomahawk cruise missiles, Harpoon
anti-ship missiles, 12 5-inch guns and four rapid-firing 20mm
anti-aircraft guns for close-in defense.
   The Iowa, which was damaged in the April 19 explosion that
killed 47 sailors, is undergoing repairs in Norfolk, Va.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, called the prospect of the Iowa and New
Jersey being mothballed ``a grave disappointment.''
   Warner said future U.S. operations may require amphibious
assaults and the battleships are key to that type of work.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The struggle for union democracy that has
closed a Ford Motor Co. plant for 11 days and left one worker dead
is the latest example of the rank-and-file dissent after years of
close union-management cooperation.
   Workers occupying the Cuautitlan plant 15 miles north of Mexico
City accuse union leader Hector Uriarte of being pro-management and
say the Mexican Labor Federation put him in office after a
fraudulent election.
   The dissidents want Uriarte booted and refused an offer of a
referendum because union officials wouldn't agree to provisions for
ensuring a fair vote, said dissident leader Salvador Fuentes Reyes.
Other demands are secondary, said Fuentes.
   ``Now it's not a question of profits,'' Fuentes said. ``The
basic problem is democratic life in the union.''
   The refrain is a common one as organized labor searches for its
footing in a changed Mexican political and economic environment.
   Dominated for decades by government-allied leaders known for
manipulating funds and using their posts as springboards to public
office, rank-and-filers lack leaders and experience in fighting for
better conditions.
   Seven years of economic crises have eroded raises and the
once-bountiful fringe benefits old-school leaders were able to hand
out to pacify workers and turn out the vote for the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Many of the entrenched bosses under attack are close to Fidel
Velazquez, who is 89. For 45 years he has ruled the 2.5 million
member Mexican Workers' Federation, known as CTM for its Spanish
initials.
   In his drive to restore prosperity, President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari has kept labor off balance. He opened the door to new
boldness by cracking down on corruption and jailing the boss of the
powerful oil workers' union.
   But deposed bosses have been replaced by leaders also aligned
with the government, and Salinas has left no doubt his priority is
streamlining production. Privatization of government-owned industry
has cost thousands of jobs.
   Last year, a monthlong strike by dissidents in the 1.1
million-strong national teachers' union forced the removal of their
boss of 17 years. His replacement, though pro-government, has
allowed the dissidents a greater voice in union affairs.
   In a months-long battle that began with a gunbattle between
rival union groups at a luxury hotel, dissident members of the
musicians' union managed to get rid of Venustiano Reyes, a
Velazquez crony.
   But the dissidents are still barred from union offices and
continue to press their cause in concerts from a makeshift
bandstand at one of the busiest corners in town.
   At the Ford plant, workers and newspaper accounts said 150 to
250 thugs inside the plant began firing guns and beating workers as
they arrived for the morning shift Jan. 8. Ten workers were
injured; one died two days later.
   Workers accused Uriarte and the company of being in cahoots,
saying the attackers arrived in Labor Federation buses.
   ``The company let them in,'' said Jose Antonio Galindo
Hernandez, a dissident who has been fired. Galindo and other
workers said the attackers wore company uniforms and identification
badges.
   ``Ford has filed a criminal complaint with authorities to
clarify this situation and fix responsibilities,'' said company
spokesman Carlos Bandala when asked about the accusations.
   About 1,500 workers occupied the plant in around-the-clock
shifts. Workers have accused armed Uriarte hirelings of going to
dissident employees' homes and threatening them.
   In newspaper ads, Ford said it would not reopen until there was
security for the plant's 3,800 workers.
   ``Anyone who says (Ford) wants to close the plant is not
right,'' Bandala said. He said production had been increased from
360 to 450 units a day the past six months and 800 to 900 new
workers were hired.
   He did not have an estimate of how much the shutdown was costing
the company.

   The Soviet Union, which has been buying U.S.
wheat lately, has added soybean meal to its shopping list, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Officials said private exporters sold 100,000 metric tons of
meal to the Soviets for delivery by Sept. 30 under a long-term
grain agreement between the two countries.
   The current pact began its seventh year on Oct. 1 and will
expire on Dec. 31. Negotiations on a new agreement are scheduled to
resume March 21-22 in Vienna.
   Most sales have been grain, including about 11 million tons of
corn and more than 2.2 million tons of wheat for delivery during
the seventh year. Sales of soybean meal now total 895,000 tons for
1989-90 delivery; soybeans, 217,900 tons; and barley, 7,300 tons.
   All of the wheat, including 525,000 tons announced earlier in
the week, has been sold at prices subsidized under the department's
Export Enhancement Program. Only wheat is approved for sale to
Moscow under the subsidy program.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Meal prices at Midwest processors have been around $180 per ton
of 2,000 pounds each, according to USDA market reports. A metric
ton is about 2,205 pounds, indicating a value of about $198 per
metric ton, or a total estimate of around $19.8 million.

<HEAD>Government Offers Incentives for Crackdowns on Drunken Drivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Transportation offered
financial incentives Thursday to states and cities that take tough
new steps to crack down on drunken drivers.
   ``Real success in the fight against drunk drivers calls for
action at the state and local levels,'' Transporation Secretary
Samuel K. Skinner said in a statement. ``These grants will help to
get strong, tough laws implemented across the board.''
   Jerry Ralph Curry of the department's National Highway Safety
Administration said cooperating states will share $4 million in the
fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.
   States will be eligible for grants if they provide for the
suspension of offenders' drivers licenses and maintain an
anti-drinking program that includes ``aggressive enforcement,
prosecution, sentencing, education and public information
activities,'' the department said.
   The basic grant may be increased if the state can complete the
suspending of a license within 15 days of an arrest.
   Curry said 10 percent bonuses will be awarded to states that:
   _Prohibit the consumption of alcohol or the possession of an
open alcohol bottle or can in the passenger compartment of a motor
vehicle. Rigorous enforcement and stiff penalties could increase
the bonus to 25 percent.
   _Require a blood-alcohol test after crashes involving serious
injury and in which alcohol is suspected as a cause.
   _Prevent drivers under age 21 from buying alcoholic beverages by
providing an easily distinguishable license.
   _Cancel vehicle registration and recall license plates of
drivers convicted more than once of an alcohol-related offense or
who drive after their license has been suspended for such an
offense.

   Two daughters of exiled King Michael of Romania
flew to Bucharest Thursday on their first visit to the country.
Their father has offered to return as head of a constitutional
moncharchy.
   A source close to the family said Princesses Margarita and
Sophie planned to stay at least five days. Their program was not
disclosed and phone calls to the family's residence near Geneva
were unanswered.
   Both daughters were born after Michael went into exile in
January 1948. He has never renounced the throne, saying he was
under coercion when he signed an act of abdication shortly before
he left the country.
   He told a news conference Dec. 22 after the overthrow of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu that he was ready to return to his
country as head of a constitutional monarchy ``if the people want
me to come back.'' Michael, who holds now a British passport, moved
to Switzerland more than 30 years ago.
   Margarita is his oldest daughter and is the first in line to
succeed him as head of the royal house. She has been an official
with the Rome-based United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization but joined her father after the first reports of
turmoil in Romania. She is fluent in French and English but does
not speak Romanian.

   Federal health officials said Thursday that nine
preventable chronic diseases are responsible for more than half the
deaths in this country _ but get only 2 percent of the public
health dollars spent by the states.
   Meanwhile, another preventable cause, injuries, remains the
leading cause of ``premature loss of life'' with suicide and
homicide and AIDS also ranking high.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported that nine
chronic diseases _ diseases with long periods of onset or suffering
_ by themselves accounted for 1.1 million deaths in 1986, 52
percent of the deaths nationwide.
   They are stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obstructive lung
disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal
cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
   ``They're all largely preventable _ or preventable to some
extent,'' said Dr. Robert Hahn, a CDC epidemiologist.
   The preventable risk factors for those nine chronic diseases
include cigarette smoking, overweight, high blood pressure,
drinking and lack of exercise.
   ``We know what the risk factors are,'' Hahn said. ``We know less
about how you get people to act on them.''
   According to a report from 45 states and the District of
Columbia, less than 2 percent of state public health expenditures
are allocated to prevent and control chronic disease, the CDC said.
   ``That's low,'' Hahn said, noting that other chronic diseases
not included in the CDC's dangerous nine also could be targets of
increased public health efforts.
   The average state expenditure on chronic disease control and
prevention is 66 cents per person per year, Hahn said.
   That amount includes money spent on efforts such as disease
screening programs, but does not include education or direct
doctors' camparable figures on federal public health spending for chronic
disease were not available, Hahn said. Many of the federal
government's health programs concentrate on research, epidemiology
and education, not the traditional screening and prevention efforts
of state-funded health clinics.
   Dr. Robert Blendon, chairman of the Department of Health Policy
and Management at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the
bulk of state health expenditures in this country are tied up in
Medicaid, and the situation has grown worse with the mounting
federal deficit in the 1980s.
   ``Most public health activities at the state level were always
paid for by federal grants,'' Blendon said, noting that those
grants are now gone, and states are left scrambling to fund
Medicaid care of their sickest citizens.
   ``Prevention of chronic disease became the residual that
disappeared,'' he said.
   `It's very frustrating; we just don't have the early-warning
prevention systems, the minimal stuff that anybody who looks
sensibly at this would want to do,'' Blendon said.
   The tne chronic diseases included
593,000 deaths from heart disease, 149,000 from stroke, 125,000
from lung cancer, 71,000 from obstructive lung disease, such as
emphysema, and 55,000 from colorectal cancer.
   Four others caused fewer deaths, but made the CDC's list of nine
because they can be prevented or controlled: breast cancer, 40,000
deaths; diabetes, 37,000; cirrhosis, 26,000; and cervical cancer,
4,500.
   The total of 1.1 million deaths is down about 10 percent from
1979, Hahn said, largely becaus of decreases in heart disease and
stroke.
   Leading causes of death not on the chronic disease list include
unintentional injuries, which killed some 95,000 people, according
to 1987 reports, and pneumonia and flu, which killed about 69,000.
   Death rates from the nine preventable chronic diseases listed by
the CDC were generally lower in the West, the agency reported. The
highest 1986 death rate was in Michigan, 518 such deaths per
100,000 people; lowest was in Hawaii, 327 per 100,000.
   Meanwhile, the CDC said Thursday, unintentional injuries take
the greatest toll when age is factored into death statistics to
measure years of potential life lost.
   The CDC routinely studies the leading killers of young people by
measuring years not lived by people who die before 65; 65 is an
arbitrary cutoff, since the nation's life expectancy is somewhat
higher.
   In 1988, the latest year for which analysis is available, deaths
from unintentional injuries robbed their under-65 victims of an
estimated 2.3 million years of life, the CDC said. Such injuries
kill about 28,000 Americans under 65 every year.
   Cancer took 1.8 million years of potential life, heart disease
accounted for 1.5 million years, and suicide and homicide together
accounted for 1.4 million years.
   The numbers of actual premature deaths in 1988 were not
available. However, 1987 totals were: unintentional injuries, about
28,000 victims under 65; cancer, 160,000; heart disease, 141,000;
and 24,000 suicides and 20,000 homicides.
   AIDS was the sixth leading cause of lost years of life in 1988,
after birth defects, and robbed its victims of an estimated 472,000
years of life. It was seventh in 1987, when 13,000 deaths accounted
for 363,000 years of life lost, or 30 percent less than in 1988.

   Authorities on Thursday arrested a former
Politburo member under investigation for corruption and abuse of
power and put him in prison to await trial, along with seven other
ex-leaders.
   Communists and opposition groups held their eighth round of
talks, with the opposition demanding a role in dismantling the
hated secret police force.
   The opposition also demanded the right to speak in Parliament.
   Negotiators unanimously approved a resolution calling on
Communist Premier Hans Modrow to give them periodic written updates
on the dissolution of the secret police force, which is to be
dissolved by June 30.
   The negotiators also called on the secret police to turn in
their guns, grenades and other weapons by the end of this month.
   The imprisoned ex-official was identified as Hermann Axen, who
was once the Communist Party's top foreign policy representative.
   Axen, 73, was jailed after returning from an eye operation in
Moscow, the official ADN news agency said, quoting government
authorities.
   Seven other members of the disgraced regime of Erich Honecker
also are in prison awaiting trial on charges they abused their
positions of power.
   ADN said authorities found additional evidence against Honecker,
who was forced from office Oct. 18, and against former Politburo
members Guenter Mittag and Erich Mielke.
   Mittag, the former economics czar, is blamed for the nation's
industrial slump, while Mielke headed the secret police. They are
in prison.
   Honecker is hospitalized after undergoing an operation last week
to remove a kidney tumor. He and Mielke are expected to be tried
for high treason.
   The latest threat to Modrow's coalition government appeared to
have been defused, at least temporarily. Christian Democratic
leader Lothar de Maiziere said his threat on Wednesday to quit the
government was ``premature.'' A final decision is expected soon.
   De Maiziere had complained the Communists held too much power.
   Modrow has appealed to his coalition partners to hold the
government together until the nation's first free elections less
than four months from now, spokesman Wolfgang Meyer told a news
conference in East Berlin.
   ``The government is standing firm in its responsibilities,''
Meyer said.
   Strikes and demonstrations have kept up the pressure on the
government, while boosting opposition forces before the May 6
balloting.
   The New Forum opposition group opened Thursday's negotiations
with a call to maintain the ``peaceful revolution'' that has swept
the country since October.
   It also demanded full access to documents regarding the secret
police. Government officials say the number of agents and
informants was nearly 200,000.
   In presenting the resolution, New Forum representative Reinhard
Scult called the secret police ``a danger to development of
society, and a danger to internal peace.''
   The secret police force, known as the ``Stasi,'' used strong-arm
methods to suppress dissent during the Honecker era.
   Negotiators Thursday asked that former Communist Party leader
Egon Krenz be forced to reveal comprehensive information about the
secret police when he appears before the panel next week.
   On Wednesday, Krenz cited an oath of secrecy in refusing to
divulge such information to a commission investigating the brutal
tactics used by police to disperse pro-democracy protests Oct. 7-8.
   Honecker has denied responsibility for the brutality, but on
Wednesday ousted Politburo member Guenter Schabowski said Honecker
was to blame.
   ``Honecker took things into his own hands,'' Schabowski said.
``All decisions and orders that led to the police actions against
demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through
Honecker and Mielke.''

<HEAD>Mistrial On White House Drug Sale; Convictions on Other Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A judge declared a mistrial again Thursday on
a charge that an 18-year-old supplied the cocaine that President
Bush used as a prop in a speech last September.
   A jury convicted the young man, Keith Jackson, on three other
drug counts.
   After two days of deliberations, the jury was unable to reach
verdicts on two charges against Jackson _ selling crack cocaine to
an undercover federal agent in Lafayette Park across the street
from the White House last Sept. 1, and using a telephone to arrange
the sale. U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin declared a mistrial
on those two counts.
   The jury convicted Jackson of distributing crack cocaine at a
shopping mall and twice near a high school in the District of
Columbia between last April 24 and July 27.
   Jackson was retried on the five charges after another jury
failed to reach verdicts on any counts in December.
   Sentencing was set for March 16. Under federal sentencing
guidelines, he faces a minimum of 12 years in prison and a maximum
of more than 15 years, according to the U.S. attorney's office.
Judges may depart from the guidelines, but substantial departures
can be appealed.
   Much of the testimony at Jackson's two trials focused on events
surrounding the president's speech.
   White House aides decided to have the president hold up a bag of
crack for the camera. Drug Enforcement Administration officials
changed the location of a pending undercover purchase to
accommodate a White House request to get the drugs near the White
House. The president noted the location of the purchase in his
speech.
   DEA officials have said they had difficulty getting Jackson to
come to Lafayette Park because he didn't know where the White House
was.
   Jackson's lawyer, Charles Stow, brought out in court that a DEA
agent in the Lafayette Park transaction wore a body microphone that
didn't work. A cameraman who was supposed to videotape the
transaction was unable to do so because he was assaulted by a
homeless person.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A popular radio satirist who was
shot twice by an unidentified assailant while walking home from
work died Thursday, Radio Metropole said.
   Jean-Andre Destin, 33, had finished a late-night broadcast at
the capital's Radio Cacique when someone in a passing car shot him
in the chest about 1 a.m. Wednesday, private Radio Metropole said.
   After lying unattended on the sidewalk for about three hours,
Destin was taken to General Hospital where he underwent two
operations. He died before dawn Thursday.
   ``In past months, journalists have been targeted by the verbal
attacks of the government, and now the attacks have ended in
bloodshed,'' Dischler Marcelin, general secretary of the Haitian
Association of Journalists, said Thursday.
   Marcelin said his group demanded an immediate police
investigation. In the past Haitian police have ignored calls to
investigate killings.
   In recent months the state-run daily L'Union has accused the
journalists' association of ``acting above the law,'' while
military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril has accused the press of
``disinformation.''
   Destin, who regularly lampooned public figures on his program,
had a wide following among the Creole-speaking masses of the
capital.

   All else being equal, a married, pro-choice
Democratic woman would easily defeat a married, anti-abortion
Republican man in a hypothetical election held today, according to
a survey released Thursday by a woman's political organization.
   The poll conducted for EMILY's List shows a 12-point margin
between two such candidates in a hypothetical election. It was the
widest spread among the combinations of candidates presented to
poll respondents.
   The results are ``a key to electing more Democratic women, which
is not an easy task,'' said Ellen Malcolm, president of the
organization, which raises money and identifies political
opportunities for female Democratic officeseekers.
   The poll said that when marital status and sex were not
specified, ``pro-choice'' Democrats would have a 10-point advantage
over ``pro-life'' Republicans. EMILY's List said it used the terms
``pro-choice'' and ``pro-life'' because of the strong images they
present and because of the likelihood that candidates would use one
of the terms to describe themselves.
   Malcolm said the survey was designed to single out the affects
of being ``pro-choice'' or ``pro-life'' and therefore did not offer
respondents any other information about the hypothetical candidate
besides that, party affiliation, sex and marital status.
   The release of the survey coincided with a meeting of the
National Republican Committee, which was expected to focus on how
GOP candidates should deal with abortion in elections this year.
   After Democrats demonstrated in Virginia and New Jersey in 1989
that a pro-choice stand was key to winning statewide offices,
Republican leaders began saying the GOP was ``a big tent'' with
room for both views, despite opposition to abortion from President
Bush and the party platform.
   The pitfalls of that position were reflected in the EMILY's List
poll, which had hypothetical pro-choice Republicans doing ``less
well overall'' than hypothetical pro-choice Democrats because the
Republicans were not supported by conservatives.
   ``We wish the Republicans luck in trying to find a place in
their tent for all the members of their party,'' said Malcolm.
   The only bright spot for Republicans in the poll's findings was
for those running as pro-choice against anti-abortion Democrats.
   ``Republican candidates who are pro-choice have a 5-point
advantage over Democratic candidates who are `pro-life,''' said
Celinda Lake of Greenberg-Lake The Analysis Group Inc., which
conducted the poll.
   Her telephone survey was conducted from Dec. 12-16, 1989, among
810 randomly selected registered voters. Each state was represented
in proportion to its share of the nation's population.
   The responses should be within 3.5 percentage points of those
that would have been obtained if all registered voters had been
questioned, said Lake.
   The survey also included a sample of 200 Hispanic voters who
proved to be ``remarkably pro-choice,'' according to Lake.
   She said 37 percent of Hispanic voters supported keeping
abortion legal under all circumstances, 51 percent under certain
circumstances. Twelve percent were against legalized abortion.
   A difficult issue for pro-choice candidates is whether minors
should have to secure a parent's approval to have an abortion.
   ``As in other surveys, voters overwhelmingly support parental
consent,'' Lake said, with ``68 percent in favor to 27 percent
opposed'' in this survey.
   Malcolm said pro-choice candidates must show great concern and
sensitivity about the question of parental consent.
   She said her organization had no pat strategy for pro-choice
candidates in states where parental consent is in the legislative
forefront.
   ``What we will say is, `You need to look at the landscape in
your district,''' she said.
   EMILY's List was founded in 1985, principally to raise seed
money for candidates. Its name is an acronym for ``early money is
like yeast'' _ it makes the dough rise.
   The group in 1986 helped make Barbara Mikulski of Maryland the
first Democratic woman elected to the Senate.

   Hungary on Thursday demanded that the
estimated 52,000 Soviet troops in its country go home in 1991 at
the latest, accelerating its timetable for a pullout.
   At East-West arms control talks, it also broke ranks with the
Soviet Union and proposed dramatic cuts in foreign troops,
including U.S. soldiers, stationed in Europe.
   The surprise announcements by Ferenc Somogyi, state secretary of
the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, were another sign of the growing
independence of members of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Czechoslovakia said this week wants the 75,000 Soviet troops
within its borders out by the end of 1990. In Poland, Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa made a similar demand Thursday in talks with
Soviet Ambassador Wladimir Browikow.
   Walesa said he told Browikow the Soviet troops should have been
withdrawn ``a long time ago because a situation may occur when it
will be hot and people start to protest.''
   In the drive toward democracy, the Budapest government has told
Moscow it wants its troops withdrawn but gave no deadline. Somogyi
insisted Thursday that they must leave this year or 1991 at the
latest.
   ``There is no political or military reason which would justify
or call for the foreign troops ... in Hungary,'' he told a news
conference.
   He said the Hungarian armed forces was capable of defending its
own territory.
   In 1956, the Soviets sent troops and tanks into Hungary to
silence a popular uprising against Stalinism. Reformist Premier
Imre Nagy was later convicted of treason in a show trial and
executed.
   Hungary's cuurent premier, Miklos Nemeth, recently met Soviet
Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov to arrange talks on a pullout. Nemeth had
stressed that withdrawal depended on an East-West agreement to
reduce conventional, or non-nuclear, forces in Europe.
   About 10,000 Soviet troops already have left both Hungary and
Czechoslovakia under a gradual withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers from
Eastern Europe, announced in December 1988 by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   An additional 6,000 of the 52,000 Soviet troops said to be left
in Hungary are due to leave this year. An undisclosed number are to
leave Czechoslovakia, where officials say there are 75,000 Soviet
troops.
   Somogyi also said he formally proposed greater cuts in foreign
troops than previous U.S. or Soviet proposals at the 23-nation
negotiations on reducing conventional arms in Europe.
   President Bush has suggested the United States and the Soviet
Union trim their forces stationed in Europe, outside their home
territory, to 275,000 on each side. That would require the Soviets
to pull out 300,000 troops and the United States 30,000.
   The Soviet Union has talked about a limit of 300,000 to 350,000
troops stationed abroad in each alliance. That would cover not only
American, but also British, French and other Western forces
stationed in West Germany.
   Somogyi said his plan would go farther.
   The ceiling, he said, should cover all foreign forces and ``be
brought much below the currently negotiated level of 275,000
troops.''
   He gave no number.
   He said Hungary believes there would be no need of foreign
troops in Europe were the current political developments to
continue. But he said it would be unrealistic now to push for total
withdrawal.
   The arms negotiations is between the 16 nations of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven of the Warsaw Pact. NATO
wants to reach an agreement this year troops, tanks, artillery and
other conventional arms.
   Senior military officers from 35 nations also were meeting in
Vienna for a third day to discuss East-West military strategies.
   Romania's military chief, Gen. Vasile Ionel, said the new
government was working to create a democratic society. He said the
government wanted a military budget that provided the minimum
amount necessary for national defense.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the
arrest of former President Leon Febres Cordero, who is accused of
embezzling public funds in a case arising from charges against his
son-in-law.
   ``I'm indignant,'' Febres Cordero said later in a TV interview.
``I have a clean conscience because I am a clean man.''
   The court order was provisional. It said Febres Cordero must be
held in prison in Quito but also said the decision can be appealed.
   The court also ratified an arrest order against Miguel Orellana,
Febres Cordero's son-in-law and his private secretary while he was
president.
   Orellana is a fugitive from justice on the earlier arrest order.
   The warrant against Febres Cordero involves the alleged payment
of $150,000 to an Israeli antiterrorism expert in 1987 while Febres
Cordero was president.
   When asked by the Channel 10 TV reporter whether he would resist
arrest, Febres Cordero replied, ``Arrest me? Arrest me? Why would
they?''
   Febres Cordero, a wealthy industrialist, returned to his
hometown of Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city and its commercial
hub 165 miles southwest of Quito, when his four-year term of office
ended in 1988. He continues to enjoy wide popularity there.
   According to Radio Sucre in Guayaquil, after the court's
decision became known, hundreds of people gathered outside Febres
Cordero's home. A caravan of 60 to 80 cars followed him to his
private office, where he gave the TV interview.
   ``The people are my judge,'' he said. ``If the people want to
support the one who has defended them, that's fine with me. Let
them come forth so that the country can begin the restitution of an
honest, uncorrupted judicial system.''
   Late Thursday, riot police used tear gas to break up a crowd of
hundreds of pro-Febres Cordero supporters who assembled on central
9th of October Avenue because the rally had not been authorized by
the authorities. Radio reports from Guayaquil said there were no
reports of injuries or detentions.
   Febres Cordero's former interior minister, Heinz Moeller, called
the court's decision ``political.''
   Febres Cordero, an archconservative, was president from 1984 to
1988.
   In 1987, his son-in-law Orellana received $150,000 in cash from
the Central Bank, which Orellana says was used to pay Israel
security adviser Ram Gazit for advice in fighting a small leftist
guerrilla group then active in Ecuador.
   Before Orellana vanished, he said he could not present proof of
how the money was spent because Gazit, for security reasons, could
not appear in his defense.
   After moderate leftist Rodrigo Borja was elected president in
1988, the Central Bank revealed the $150,000 was withdrawn in cash
and no accounting for it was given.
   Febres Cordero charged at the time that the case was meant to
embarrass him politically and said he assumed responsibility for
the spending of the money.
   Febres Cordero had a stormy term of office. He was kidnapped in
1987 by paratroopers loyal to an air force commander who had
rebelled against the government in 1986. After Febres Cordero won
his release by pardoning the jailed general, the leftist-controlled
Congress sought to impeach him.

<HEAD>Prince of Wales Named Author of Year in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Prince of Wales, who penned a bestselling book
that criticized much of modern architecture as lacking character,
was named author of the year Thursday at a British awards ceremony.
   ``A Vision of Britain'' by Prince Charles has been among the top
selling books since it was published last year.
   American and Canadian editions of the book have sold well and it
has also been translated into Italian.
   In the book, the prince said some modern architects replaced the
traditions and harmonies of the past with ``Frankenstein monsters,
devoid of character, alien and largely unloved except by the
professors who have been concocting these horrors in their
laboratories.''
   Charles, 41-year-old heir to the British throne, won the first
Author of the Year award. It was accepted on his behalf by
Christopher Martin, who produced a British Broadcasting Corp.
documentary in which the prince guided viewers around some
buildings he liked and many he didn't.
   The program was seen by 4{ million British viewers when it was
first shown more than a year ago, and by 3.7 million when it was
repeated. It was shown this month on public television in the
United States.
   The book also led to an exhibition at London's Victoria and
Albert Museum that attracted 45,000 visitors _ the museum's most
popular event in 1989.
   In a videotaped acceptance speech to 500 authors and publishers,
Charles said: ``I couldn't have been more amazed that my name was
included because when I entered this venture I had considerable

<HEAD>Break-In Shows Military Computer Vulnerable _ Prosecutor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Silicon Valley computer workers
have been charged with breaking into government and telephone
company computers in a case that prosecutors said Thursday
demonstrates the vulnerability of those systems.
   The three are accused of committing what may be the first
electronic invasion of a military computer network, according to
one expert. A federal indictment charges them with obtaining flight
orders for a military training exercise, of eavesdropping on
private telephone conversations and getting FBI information on
associates of the late Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos.
   The case ``does signal a vulnerability'' in the Pentagon's
computers, U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said Thursday at a news
conference in San Francisco.
   The indictment, unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San
Jose, is one of the first in the nation to use federal criminal
statutes directed at computer crime, said assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert K. Crowe in a news release.
   The charges, Crowe said, reveal ``the extreme vulnerability of
the phone network.''
   Charged were Kevin L. Poulsen, 24, a former employee of SRI
International, a Menlo Park computer consulting company; Mark K.
Lottor, 25, a current SRI employee; and Robert E. Gilligan, 31, who
worked for computer-maker Sun Microsystems.
   ``Poulsen could do whatever he wanted to do with the telephone
system as well as with government computers,'' Crowe said Wednesday.
   The three are charged with 19 counts of conspiracy; computer
fraud; fraud involving computer access devices; using fictitious
names or addresses; possession of electronic wiretapping devices;
falsely repesenting a social security number; interception of
electronic communications; embezzlement and theft of public
property.
   Poulsen is named in 17 counts involving all of the offenses;
Lottor is named in five counts and Gilligan named in seven counts.
   If convicted, Lottor and Gilligan face 20 years in prison and
fines of $30,000. Poulsen could be sentenced to 37 years in prison
and a $50,000 fine.
   According to the indictment, Poulsen used common burglary tools
including surgical gloves, powdered graphite and lock picks, and
forged a Pacific Bell employee card to steal the telecommunications
equipment and access codes from the regional phone company's
offices.
   Gilligan and Poulsen are accused of trafficking in codes that
allow access to government computers through electronic mail.
   The pair got access to the Army's Masnet Computer Network, the
indictment said without detailing uses of the computer.
   In late 1987 and early 1988, Poulsen got air tasking orders for
a military exercise at Fort Bragg, N.C., called CPX Caber Dragon,
the indictment said. The information, secret at the time, has been
declassified because the event has already taken place, Russoniello
said.
   The Marcos information was a computer list of phone numbers and
cable assignments of Marcos and others that related to an FBI
investigation, the indictment said.
   Peter G. Neumann, a computer security expert at SRI, said this
was the first case he knew in which classified information was
allegedly obtained by computer break-ins.
   The indictment accuses Poulsen of using his computer knowledge
to obstruct the investigation into his alleged activities.
   Gilligan and Lottor were expected to surrender voluntarily.
Poulsen, who called federal authorities but manipulated the
computer so the call couldn't be traced, remained at large.
   Poulsen quit SRI in 1988 and took a job at Sun but later moved
back to Los Angeles to live with his parents, said Donn Parker,
security expert and senior management consultant with SRI.
   Poulsen was hired by SRI despite company officials' belief he
once broke into a computer at the University of California, Los
Angeles, Parker said.
   ``The people who hired him did know he had some hacker
experience in his background, but he was a very bright guy,''
Parker said. They considered the earlier incident youthful excess,
he said.
   The indictment doesn't indicate what authorities believe the men
intended to do with the military secrets, but Parker said Poulsen
told him several years ago that his youthful exploits were
motivated by curiosity.
   ``I knew him as a typical young hacker. At least in past
conversations he told me he was motivated by curiosity and the
challenge to get into systems,'' Parker said.

<HEAD>ANC says Group Unable to Intensify Guerrilla Fight, May Negotiate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress on Thursday
conceded it could not step up insurgent actions inside South
Africa, and said it may have to prepare for negotiations with the
white-led government in Pretoria.
   ``The armed struggle must continue but looking at our situation
realistically we must admit that we do not have the capacity within
our country to intensify the struggle in any meaningful way,'' said
ANC secretary-general Alfred Nzo.
   Addressing the first session of a three-day gathering of the ANC
national executive committee, Nzo said the black guerrilla group
risked being ``caught off balance'' by political reforms introduced
by President F.W. De Klerk.
   South Africa's government was pushing ahead with reforms at a
speed designed to outmaneuver the ANC and activists campaigning
against the apartheid system of racial separation, Nzo said.
   Nzo urged guerrilla leaders not to ``trail behind events with
our feet shackled by old perceptions and a fear to confront a new
reality.''
   ``We must break new ground and keep the initiative firmly in our
hands,'' he said. ``Unless we act quickly we will surrender the
initiative to Pretoria.''
   The movement began a campaign of bombing and sabotage attacks in
1961.
   Outlawed in South Africa, the ANC has repeatedly said it will
not negotiate with De Klerk until its jailed leader Nelson Mandela
is released, the organization is legalized, political trials are
halted and troops are withdrawn from black townships.
   Nzo said the Lusaka meeting will review developments in South
Africa and focus on the expected release within weeks of Mandela
and his future role in the organization.
   Among the eight freed activists visiting the ANC external
headquarters in Lusaka for the talks with exiled leaders are Walter
Sisulu, 77, one-time ANC secretary-general, and five others
released by De Klerk in October after serving more than 25 years in
prison.
   The eight are scheduled to travel to Tanzania, where the ANC has
several guerrilla training camps, on Jan. 23. Later, they will fly
to Europe where they are expected to visit ailing ANC president
Oliver Tambo.
   Tambo suffered a heart seizure last August and is under medical
care in Sweden.
   Nzo said the stroke paralyzed Tambo's right side but he was
regaining strength and was now able to walk without assistance. It
was the first confirmation by the ANC that Tambo had been
immobilized by the stroke.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa accepted an invitation to
visit Moscow formally delivered Thursday by the Soviet ambassador,
and seized the chance to tell him all Soviet troops should be
withdrawn from Poland by year's end.
   During Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov's visit to the headquarters
of the once outlawed opposition movement, Solidarity's Walesa
assailed the last 50 years of Polish-Soviet relations as ``based on
political domination by one side.''
   In a communique after the meeting, the state news agency PAP
reported, Walesa said normalizing Soviet-Polish relations also
requires:
   _An explanation of what went on behind the scenes in the Soviet
invasion of Poland as World War II began in September 1939;
   _The location of graves of Polish soldiers Walesa said were
murdered on Soviet soil in April 1940;
   _A full explanation of the imprisonment of 16 Polish leaders
summoned to postwar Moscow, and
   _Compensation for those Polish citizens who were expelled from
territory annexed by the Soviet Union after the war.
   The Katyn massacre of thousands of Polish army officers on
Soviet territory early in World War II is one of the emotional
issues still tainting Soviet-Polish relations.
   Walesa told Brovikov Soviet troops should have left ``a long
time ago because a situation may occur when it will be hot and
people start to protest.''
   ``It should be at your initiative. ... We do not want emotions
concerning (the troops) to influence relations between neighbors. .
.. You are the empire and we know that waving sabers at the Soviet
Union would be stupid.''
   The envoy replied that the troops may be ``an anachronism from
Europe's past'' but a Warsaw Pact agreement exists and the two
governments will have to decide the issue.
   Walesa's Moscow visit will be at the official invitation of
Soviet trade unions and likely include a meeting with President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   No date was announced, but the trip probably will be scheduled
for late March or April, Brovikov said.
   He said he would like Walesa to ``advocate more mutual trust and
respect. ... I would also like you to speak against all
demonstrations of anti-Sovietism, in a more decisive way.''
   ``I am going to do this, but we have to clear up the foreground
first,'' Walesa responded, referring to issues still straining
relations.
   ``We are doomed to be neighbors, so we have to make sure that it
should be good and friendly,'' Walesa said after the session.
   Brovikov called the meeting a ``breakthrough.''
   ``It was the meeting of the representative of a state that is
reforming itself and a reformer,'' he said.
   The two men discussed the need to structure relations ``on a
partnership basis,'' PAP said, as well as to ``explain matters that
put a shadow on contacts between the two nations.''
   Brovikov said, ``For the sake of a better future, we do not have
to pretend there was no past.
   ``We are supporting the Polish government because it was formed
in a democratic way. We are aware that it is an authentic
government and that this is something permanent.
   ``We are realists, too, and you have to look at us through the
new glasses, too. Give us time,'' the ambassador said.
   Walesa traveled to Moscow for the first time on Dec. 18 for the
funeral of fellow human rights activist and Nobel Peace laureate
Andrei D. Sakharow.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Solidarity editor who
became the East bloc's first non-communist government leader in
August, visited the Soviet Union in late November.

<HEAD>Racial Conflict on Rise, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIE AICHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal report Thursday concluded that
racial animosities between Indians and non-Indians have escalated
in northern Wisconsin during the past five years of tribal
spearfishing.
   The report said the rise in hostilities centered on Indian
treaty rights, and was most noticeable because of increased racist
attacks on Chippewa spearfishers.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said he hopes the report, released by the
Wisconsin Advisory Committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission,
will spur Congress to address the conflicts.
   ``It's about time the federal government said, `You know what,
we should do something,''' Thompson said. ``They're the ones who
set policy.''
   But Thompson said despite attempts at negotiations among treaty
rights factions, the issue ultimately would be decided in the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Wisconsin's six Chippewa Indian tribes retain the right to
spearfish, hunt, cut timber and gather food on off-reservation
lands under 19th century court-affirmed treaties that ceded
northern Wisconsin to the U.S. government.
   In recent years, opponents to those rights have staged large and
sometimes hostile protests at boat landings and lakes where the
Chippewa spearfish each spring. Protesters contend it's unfair to
allow only the Chippewa to legally spearfish, since the method is
very efficient.
   Last year, the protests escalated into rock-throwing and
name-calling incidents and large police forces were called in to
keep the peace. Some 200 protesters were arrested during the
demonstrations.
   James L. Baughman, committee chairman of the report, said,
``Overall, the information received indicated that little has
changed since the committee's last review of Indian treaty rights
in 1984, except for an increase in racial polarization.''
   The committee members said confrontations where the Indians
spearfish have the potential to become even more violent in future
years.
   ``The increased hostility has been particularly provoked by
spearfishing,'' Baughman said.
   The seven-member committee sent the report to the Civil Rights
Commission after it was unanimously endorsed.
   Efforts to negotiate settlements that would pay the tribes
millions of dollars to curtail its treaty rights have been rejected
during the past year by tribal members.
   The report contained no recommendations on how to deal with the
conflicts, but detailed incidents of increased racism since the
1984 study.
   The report said racism was reflected in slogans such as ``Save a
Walleye, Spear an Indian'' and ``Save a Deer, Shoot an Indian''
found on hats, handguns and bumper stickers sold in northern
Wisconsin.
   Baughman said the creation of organized anti-treaty rights
groups in recent years also has fostered racism.
   ``They've served as a catalyst,'' Baughman said. ``They've made
it a more emotional, more spirited issue than it needs to be.''
   But Chuck Valliere, vice chairman of Protect American's Rights
and Resources, which was formed about four years ago, said his
group doesn't promote racist attitudes, despite the presence of
racism in northern Wisconsin.
   ``I think our role is more to promote education about treaty
rights issues,'' he said. ``I think that it's (racism) just
something that comes out on the side. And it comes from both
sides.''
   The committee reported complaints about lack of public
information available about Indian treaty rights and the need for
Indian culture and history in curriculum.
   It also said lack of complete, accurate news media coverage was
a complaint lodged by many people.
   Willie Nunnery, a Madison attorney and committee member, said
the state government cannot wash its hands of the issue.
   ``Shifting all of this to the federal government is like
shifting the buck,'' he said.

<HEAD>Portugal Requests Int'l Aid to Fight Oil Slick</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VILA BALEIRA, Madeira Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portugal asked for help
Thursday to combat an oil slick that has devastated wildlife and
coated the beaches of one of its islands with foul-smelling slime,
officials said.
   The government requested aid from the European Community's
anti-pollution task force in Brussels, Belgium, to coordinate
international assistance to the Madeira island of Porto Santo, a
navy spokesman said.
   Cmdr. Antonio Monteiro Coelho said Portugal asked for floating
barriers, pumps and solvents from the European Community to protect
nearby islands in case a change in the wind put them in the path of
the oil spill, whose origin remains a mystery.
   Monteiro Coelho said 200 tons of crude oil had already been
removed from the tiny island where oil from the 12-mile-long slick
first washed ashore Sunday.
   However, pollution experts in Porto Santo said the clean-up may
take three months.
   The slick covered Porto Santo's rocky north and east coasts and
hit the white sands of a famous six-mile beach that is the island's
main tourist attraction.
   Porto Santo, part of Portugal's Madeira achipelago, is about 625
miles southwest of Lisbon, the mainland capital, and 435 miles west
of Morocco.
   Environmentalists said the deaths of dozens of rare loggerhead
turtles, gulls and fish constituted an ecological disaster and
accused local and central authorities of responding slowly to the
slick.
   In a telephone interview, Monteiro Coelho said if the slick
continued its course it would avoid a nature reserve on the
uninhabited Desertas islands 35 miles to the south and the volcanic
cliffs of the main Madeira island, a major winter destination.
   The Desertas are home to a variety of rare maritime animals,
including one of the world's last breeding colonies of the
Mediterranean monk seal, an endangered marine mammal.
   Patches of oil washed up on Madeira's north coast Wednesday but
were described as ``insignificant'' by a Madeira-based naval
officer.
   Still, islanders on Porto Santo were using reserves of drinking
water after desalination plants providing 80 percent of the water
supply were closed after oil contamination of the seawater supply.
   The island's fish market was also closed because of fears of oil
contamination.

   Thursday's acquittals in the McMartin
Pre-School molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors
botched it, while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of
justice over hysteria and hype.
   Mother-and-son defendants Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, and Raymond
Buckey, 31, wept as the verdicts were announced. Jurors found the
pair innocent of 52 charges and couldn't reach a verdict on 13
other counts. Prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges
in a new trial.
   ``I just said, `I told you Ray,''' Mrs. Buckey said. Asked if
her son was surprised, she said. ``He had fear, definitely.''
Buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his
lawyer.
   ``If it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to
you, too. If it had not been in my faith in God I wouldn't be here
today,'' she said.
   But several parents of former students at the school said the
Buckeys won because the system lost.
   ``It was never done properly,'' said parent Alan Lagunoff, who
moved to Central California from suburban Manhattan Beach. ``I have
to sit back and figure out what to do with my son. I fear that
because of this verdict, no child will be seen as a credible
witness from now on.''
   His son, now 10, attended the school for 1{ years but wasn't a
witness at the trial.
   ``I don't think it's worth it to bring this thing back into the
courts. It will just be another six-year travesty,'' Lagunoff said.
   ``The system is not going to protect children,'' said Jackie
McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but
didn't testify in the case. ``I don't know what the message is that
the jury wanted to get out. I'm anxious to hear that.''
   Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and husband of Mrs. Buckey,
suggested Deputy District Attorney Lael Rubin, who prosecuted the
case for its entire six years, was motivated by personal ambition.
   ``My concern primarily was Lael Rubin, who is `anything goes' in
order to secure a conviction. ... If you don't win, you don't get
promoted,'' he said.
   Juror Brenda Williams said the evidence failed to convince the
jury beyond a reasonable doubt in 52 of the charges.
   ``Even if you accept that the children were molested, it didn't
necessarily mean they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School,''
Ms. Williams told reporters.
   Raymond Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail
during the case, which defense attorneys said was the result of
community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic
mother of one child at the preschool.
   Some observers accused then-District Attorney Robert Philibosian
of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing re-election
campaign against Ira Reiner, who beat him and now runs the district
attorney's office.
   Philibosian, however, insisted he would not have handled the
matter differently.
   ``Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am not
going to take any public criticism directed at me. Let him respond
to the criticism,'' said Philibosian, now in private law practice.
   Also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a
private child therapy group, Children's Institute International, to
conduct the original interviews with the children. Defense
attorneys maintained that questions by the institute's researchers
were leading and prejudicial.
   Jurors agreed.
   ``We never got the children's stories in their own words,'' said
juror John Breese.
   Children's Institute officials didn't immediately return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   Originally, there were seven defendants, including Raymond
Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann Buckey, and Virginia McMartin, the
founder of the school, mother of Mrs. Buckey and grandmother of
Raymond Buckey.
   Hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the
case, which gained worldwide attention with its tales of
underground tunnels at the school and Satanic rituals.
   The focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as
Reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants
after reviewing the case. The underground tunnels were never found.
No proof was ever produced of Satanic rituals.
   Reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long,
expensive prosecution.
   ``It took far too long and cost far too much money to have what
has been called perfect justice. We need reform,'' Reiner said,
adding that in trying to describe the case, ``Insane is the word
that comes to mind.''
   The case was the longest and the costliest in American judicial
history, at 2{ years and $15 million. Superior Court Judge William
Pounders said he did what he could to limit its length, cutting 50
witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case.
   For parents and others, there was more to ponder than legal
questions.
   ``Life is not fair. I tell my children all the time ... there is
no such thing as fair,'' said Robert Currie, whose son attended
McMartin but didn't testify at the trial.
   ``It's really a travesty for a case to take this long,'' said
Ms. Rubin, the prosecutor. ``...Not only for the families, the
children in this case, but also for the defendants as well.''

<HEAD>President Appeals for U.S. Aid to Panama; Seen in Public with
Girlfriend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Guillermo Endara on
Thursday appealed to the United States and other countries for help
in rebuilding the economy, where he said a third of the work force
is unemployed.
   ``But the most important ingredient,'' Endara told nearly 400
business leaders and members of the Civic Crusade, ``will be our
own work and the adjustments needed to make out economy competitive
again.''
   The organization is an umbrella group for opponents of ousted
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Also Thursday, Endara said he has a 24-year-old girlfriend but
has no plans to marry soon.
   ``We are getting to know each other,'' Endara, who is 54, told
reporters.
   Endara, whose wife, Marcela Cambra, died shortly after the May
elections, appeared in public Monday with girlfriend Ana Mai Diaz
for the first time and journalists saw them holding hands.
   ``I am going out with her but I have not yet thought of getting
married,'' he said.
   Government sources said Endara will travel Sunday to San Jose,
Costa Rica, to meet with President Oscar Arias and would make an
official visit to Washington late this month.
   Endara said unemployment is the most pressing problem facing the
government. Without giving any figures, he said 33 percent of the
labor force was unemployed.
   The Panamanian president said he had written to President Bush
outlining Panama's economic needs.
   ``The U.S. assistance is important to complement our own
economic efforts and to strengthen democracy and freedom and to
make sure that the sacrifices of Panamanians and Americans were not
in vain,'' he added referring to the dead during the U.S. invasion
that was launched Dec. 20.
   The U.S. action ousted Noriega, who awaits trial in Florida on
drug charges, and resulted in Endara taking office. Endara was
leading by a 3-1 margin in last year's presidential elections when
Noriega canceled the vote count.
   Endara asked for ``the generous and timely help of the United
States and other friendly countries'' to help rebuild Panama's
economy. Officials say Panama sustained more than $2 billion damage
from the invasion.
   A Panamanian commission is in the United States meeting with
U.S. officials to speed up the flow of economic assistance to
Panama. The United States has expressed a willingness to help
Panama but declined to give figures on how much aid money will be
forthcoming.
   The U.S. government froze more than $400 million in Panamanian
government assets during Noriega's last 20 months in power. The
United States has released nearly $100 million in frozen funds.

   Preschool operators Raymond Buckey and his
mother were acquitted Thursday of 52 child molestation charges in
the nation's longest and costliest criminal trial, inciting outrage
among parents whose children attended the nursery school.
   Jurors deadlocked on 12 sex abuse counts against Buckey and a
single conspiracy count against him and his 63-year-old mother,
Peggy McMartin Buckey.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders declared a mistrial on
those counts and dismissed the deadlocked conspiracy charge against
Mrs. Buckey. He set a Jan. 31 hearing to determine whether the 13
unresolved counts will be dismissed against Buckey.
   Announcement of the innocent verdicts brought gasps and sobs in
the packed courtroom.
   Buckey, 31, who spent nearly five years in jail because of the
charges, and his mother, who was jailed for almost two years, cried
as the verdicts were read.
   ``I've gone through hell and now we've lost everything,'' Mrs.
Buckey said outside court. ``My concern was for my son and what
they've done to him ... because my son would never harm a child.''
   ``I feel wonderful,'' said Charles Buckey, father of Raymond and
husband of Mrs. Buckey. Raymond Buckey avoided reporters and
slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer.
   Jurors said they didn't believe the molestation stories told by
nine children who testified in the case because they had been
manipulated by the suggestions of parents and therapists.
   ``I tried to believe the children,'' said juror Daryl Hutchins.
But, he said, the children had been so ``contaminated'' by leading
questions from adults that he couldn't.
   About an hour after the verdicts were announced, parent Jackie
McGauley said: ``I'm still in shock. ... When I first heard it, I
didn't believe it. I thought someone had made a mistake.'' Her
child wasn't among those testifying as victims.
   Mary Mae Cioffi, another parent who is vocal about the case
through her children didn't testify, added: ``I am really
disappointed. The anger is beginning to rise. We have programs all
over the country that tell children to run and tell when somebody
hurts them, and our children told. Some of them spent 35 days on
the stand and they get a `not guilty.' It shows that our justice
system needs a revamp for kids.''
   ``I know my children were molested. I had my daughter sleep
between my husband and I for a whole year because she was so afraid
somebody would come and get her, that they would kill her, because
she told,'' she said.
   The investigation of alleged mass molestation at the suburban
McMartin Pre-School ignited a nationwide wave of worry about child
abuse when it came to light in 1983. It produced widespread fear
among working parents that their children might be at risk at
school.
   The trial lasted nearly three years and cost $15 million, making
it the longest and most expensive criminal proceeding in U.S.
history.
   ``I was not surprised by the verdicts,'' the judge said at a
news conference afterward. ``I would not have been surprised at any
decision the jury made.'' He also said legislation was needed to
prevent such lengthy proceedings in the future.
   Asked if the state owes the defendants an apology, Pounders said
no. He calculated that only 30 percent of the time consumed in the
case was devoted to the prosecution.
   ``The length of the trial was due primarily to the defense
rather than the prosecution,'' he said.
   Prosecutor Lael Rubin said, ``We ultimately must respect the
jury's decision even though I personally disagree with it. ... I
believe that the families involved in this case and the children
involved in this case ... cannot be forgotten or overlooked in
terms of what they have had to endure in the kind of system we
presently have.''
   District Attorney Ira Reiner also said judicial reform was
needed.
   ``Insane is the word that comes to mind. ... We need two things
_ move cases to trial much more rapidly and through the court more
rapidly,'' he said.
   Rubin said she would consult with parents in the case before
deciding whether to refile charges against Buckey on the 13
deadlocked counts.
   Mrs. Buckey's attorney, Dean Gits, said his client would now try
to get on with her life.
   ``She wants to piece her life back together, that's all. She
really has lost everything and what she hopes to do is to move away
and eventually build a house, settle down and be left alone with
her family,'' said Gits.
   Another defense attorney, Danny Davis, said several members of
the Buckey and McMartin family planned to file a federal lawsuit
Friday, naming the city of Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles County and
others as defendants.

   Pounders was the first to see the 52 sealed verdicts, which
absolved the defendants of an array of child sexual abuse
allegations involving rape, sodomy and fondling.
   The conspiracy count alleged that Buckey and his mother
conspired to commit an assortment of lewd and lascivious acts on
children under 14 years old.
   ``This is somebody else's system,'' complained parent Bob Curry,
whose child didn't testify. ``In baseball, it's never over till
it's over. In child molestation, and this is a good example of it,
it's never over when it's over.''
   The jury spent nine weeks deliberating on the charges against
the Buckeys, who were accused of molesting 11 children over five
years at the family-owned school in suburban Manhattan Beach.
   ``You have endured where all else has failed,'' the judge told
jurors. ``There is really no way I can thank you for your service.''
   When he announced, ``You are excused from further jury
service,'' the panelists broke into shouts and applause.
   In interviews in the courtroom afterward, the jurors said they
believed some of the children were molested, but the prosecution
never established that the defendants were responsible.
   They also said parents' fears and the techniques of
psychologists who interviewed the students may have planted ideas
in the children's heads.
   ``I believe that the children believed what they were saying was
true in the courtroom,'' said juror Brenda Williams. At the
Children's Institute International, where psychologists conducted
taped interviews with the children, she said, ``I could not tell
from watching the tape that the children were telling what actually
happened to them or if they were repeating what their parents told
them.''
   As for the pressures on the jury, Ms. Williams said, ``There
were days when I didn't know if I could stand it anymore. ... I
think it's going to be very hard getting back into the real world.''
   A single scream was heard in the crowded courthouse hallway when
the verdicts were read. An unidentified woman wept into her hands
and another looked distressed. Friends or relatives shielded the
women from TV cameras.
   ``They're making a big mistake,'' said Chris Collins, 18, who as
a child was a student at McMartin Pre-School, but wasn't one of the
children involved in the abuse allegations. ``When I woke up this
morning I thought they would be going to jail the next day. The
justice system has let us down.''
   Buckey, who was released on $1.5 million bail in February, and
his mother, free on $295,000 bail, were required to stand trial
after an 18-month preliminary hearing. But five teachers who worked
at the preschool had charges against them dismissed. Among those
were Buckey's sister, Peggy Ann, and his grandmother, Virginia
McMartin, who founded the once prestigious but now defunct nursery
school.
   A jury of 12, plus six alternates, began the trial in April
1987. As months and years passed, job problems and illness left
just a dozen panelists, all necessary to deliberate and avoid a
mistrial on all 65 counts.
   More than 1,000 pieces of evidence were introduced, and 124
witnesses testified.
   The case began in August 1983 when Judy Johnson, mother of a
child at the school, told the Manhattan Beach police department's
sex abuse and juvenile investigator that her son's bottom was red
and that he had spoken of a man named Ray who worked at the school.
Letters were sent alerting parents to check their children for
signs of molestation.
   Mrs. Johnson, suffering from alcohol and mental problems, died
at age 44 a few months before trial began. Defense attorneys
contended she was unbalanced and that the case that emerged was
largely the result of her increasingly bizarre allegations.
   On the basis of her complaint, Buckey was arrested, released and
later re-arrested. By 1984, when indictments were handed up,
prosecutors accused Buckey, his mother, sister, grandmother and
three other teachers of molesting hundreds of tots at the school.
   Children gave investigators accounts of satanic rites and
animals tortured to frighten youngsters into silence.
   When Buckey and his mother finally came to trial in 1987, the
focus of the prosecution had narrowed. What had originally been
hundreds of counts of child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and
a shared count of conspiracy. The 41 children once said to have
been abused came down to 11 alleged victims.

<HEAD>Moves to Enhance U.N. Role in Cambodia Come Amid Financial Woes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY CHENAULT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. spokesman said Thursday that
peacekeeping operations face severe limitations because of overdue
payments, a key concern as diplomats work to enhance the world
body's role in Cambodia peace efforts.
   ``The financial situation has been ominous and now it's the
worst it has ever been,'' said Matthew Nerzig, a spokesman for
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Nerzig said that as of the end of 1989, overdue payments
assessed for the U.N. peacekeeping budget came to $447.3 million.
The cost of U.N. peacekeeping for 1989 was roughly $700 million, he
said.
   The United States owes the most in overdue payments, including
$152 million for peacekeeping. The Soviet Union owes $125 million
to the peacekeeping budget.
   After two days of meetings this week in Paris, the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members issued a statement calling for the
United Nations to supervise elections while international
peacekeepers guarantee security in Cambodia.
   Representatives from the five countries _ the United States,
Soviet Union, China, France and Britain _ plan to meet again in
about two weeks in New York to push the Cambodian peace plan ahead.
   The Vietnamese-backed Communist government of Cambodian Premier
Hun Sen and the three guerrilla factions allied in an uneasy
coalition all have given at least cautious support for a major U.N.
role. Some of the guerrillas are U.S.-supported.
   Perez de Cuellar called the actions in Paris ``another sign of
growing confidence'' in the world body's ability to settle
conflicts, but made it clear that money will be a major factor in
whether a peace agreement can be reached and supervised by U.N.
forces.
   In recent years the United Nations has heightened its
involvement in mediating regional conflicts, clearing the way for
an end to the Iran-Iraq war and overseeing moves toward
independence in Namibia.
   Arthur Zegelbone, a spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United
Nations, said Washington is committed to seeing a peace plan
implemented in Cambodia. But he said it is too early to estimate
the level of funding the United States can make available.
   ``When you talk about an enhanced role such as that referred to
by the representatives meeting in Paris, you're talking about a lot
of money,'' Zegelbone said.
   President Reagan ordered the withholding of U.S. dues to the
United Nations in 1985, saying the organization was spendthrift and
had a bloated bureaucracy. U.S. arrears rose to well in excess of
$500 million by late 1988.
   In September 1988, Reagan announced he was satisfied with U.N.
efforts toward fiscal reform and ordered payment of all back dues.
However, the U.S. Congress has not authorized full payment, citing
the U.S. budget deficit as a reason for not paying the arrears.

   Seven Aborigines _ four children and
three adults _ died of thirst on a desert road after their truck
broke down in 120-degree heat in the Australian Outback, police
said Friday.
   As each victim perished, those remaining in the group of 11
buried them along the road, officials said. Police found three
survivors in the Great Australian Sandy Desert on Thursday, which
led to the recovery of four of the bodies in shallow graves.
   Police officers and the Royal Flying Doctor Service searched the
harsh Outback in helicopters, light planes and four-wheel drives in
hopes of finding another man who left the band to get help. He was
feared dead.
   ``I think it just reinforces our constant warnings to people
traveling in the Outback to be careful out there,'' said police
spokesman John Skeffington. ``These people are well versed in
bushcraft and survival techniques and yet they perished.''
   The survivors were picked up by a passing motorist and were
reported in stable condition in Port Hedland Regional Hospital.
   A police spokesman said the group left Port Hedland in far
Western Australia state last Friday to return to their remote
aboriginal home at Punma, 680 miles to the east.
   Police said the flat-top vehicle was stranded about 75 miles
from the settlement in Rudall River National Park of Western
Australia.

   An Eastern Airlines 727 landing at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport collided with a twin-engine aircraft

   Barker said the smaller plane was flying from DeKalb Peachtree

when the Eastern plane landed behind it and struck it.
   Conflicting accounts gave the time of the collision at 6:30 p.m

   Jurors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation
case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a
police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case.
   Seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference
after acquitting Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin
Buckey, on 52 molestation charges Thursday said they felt some
children who testified may have been molested _ but not at the
family-run McMartin Pre-School.
   And they said some children may have merely repeated stories
told them by their parents and interviewers at Children's Institute
International.
   The private child therapy center, which specializes in abused
children, videotaped interviews with children from the McMartin
school after reports of molestations surfaced. Jurors saw the tapes
in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and
leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from
children.
   Asked what led to acquittals, juror Brenda Williams focused on
the taped interviews from the center jurors call CII.
   ``The CII interviews _ I could not accept them,'' Mrs. Williams
said. ``I believe the children believe what they were saying was
true. But at CII, I could not tell if the children were saying what
was told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating what
their parents had told them.
   ``If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had
not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more,'''
Mrs. Williams said.
   ``The CII tapes did not help me. They gave me a lot of
reasonable doubt,'' agreed juror Julie Peters, 47, a supermarket
meat wrapper.
   ``The children were never allowed to say in their own words what
happened to them. All the questions were leading. They never had a
chance to tell their stories,'' said juror John Breese, 51, a
medical technician and grandfather of five.
   ``I tried to believe the children,'' said juror Daryl Hutchins
28, an oil company lease operator. ``But if the child was so
contaminated (by the interviews) I couldn't.''
   Equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in 1983 by the
Manhattan Beach Police Department to parents of McMartin school
children. The letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation at
the school and to Buckey's arrest.
   ``The police letter should never have been sent,'' said juror
Sally Cordova, 27, a supermarket checker. ``It put the information
out there too early. The whole city knew.''
   At that point, jurors said, they felt parents had been
programmed to believe their children had been molested.
   ``One child said his parents told him that he was molested even
before he went to CII,'' Mrs. Williams recalled.
   The panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic
allegations, including some children's accounts of being molested
in a car wash. ``We just dismissed those,'' said Mrs. Williams.
   They said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact
because they weren't sure what they were seeing in the photos of
children's genitals.
   Although they acquitted defendants of most charges, the jurors
deadlocked on 13 counts. Some said they were unsure whether Buckey
was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove
its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
   Jurors said they didn't rule out that some children in the case
were molested _ but not by these defendants.
   ``Even if you accept that the children were molested,'' said
juror Mark Bassett, ``the evidence didn't establish that they were
molested at the McMartin Pre-School.''
   The panelists said they were aware of the trial's enormous toll
on defendants as well as children and parents.
   ``I think everybody is a victim,'' said Ms. Peters. ``I don't
think anybody came out of this case a winner. I think it's sad
because everybody lost something. The defendants _ their lives have
been ruined. They lost their business, their reputation. It's sad.''
   Mrs. Williams added, ``The children have to live with this. The
parents have to live with this. There's nothing I can say that will
make it better.''
   As for themselves, the jurors said their lives were ``put on
hold'' for nearly three years. Bassett lost his job as a research
computer scientist when his company folded. Mrs. Williams got
married. Breese said his wife died during the trial and he has
since remarried.
   ``It's been very hard,'' said Mrs. Williams, a telephone company
service representative. ``There were days when I thought I couldn't
stand it anymore.
   ``I don't really know my job anymore,'' she said. ``It's going
to be hard getting back into the real world.''
   The jury foreman and four other jurors declined interviews.

   A prominent Panamanian businessman indicted
with Manuel Noriega pleaded innocent Thursday to charges he schemed
with the former dictator to smuggle 1.4 million pounds of marijuana
into the United States.
   Enrique A. Pretelt was charged along with Noriega in a
three-count indictment with conspiracy and trying to smuggle the
marijuana from Colombia through Panama in 1983-84.
   After hearing the innocent plea, U.S. Magistrate Thomas G.
Wilson set the trial tentatively for April before U.S. District
Judge George C. Carr.
   During a brief arraignment, the government asked that bond be
denied. The magistrate set a detention hearing for Monday.
   Pretelt could hold the key to the government's case against
Noriega if he decided to cooperate and testify against his close
friend.
   The 47-year-old jeweler, who is Noriega's sole co-defendant, is
accused of taking bribes from Tampa-based smugglers to help ferry
millions of dollars worth of Colombian marijuana safely through
Panama.
   Prosecutors said Noriega and Pretelt took payoffs and laundered
drug profits through banks and businesses in Panama.
   More than $1 million was paid to Noriega, Pretelt and Cesar
Rodriguez-Contreras for Noriega's authorization and approval of
drug smuggling and money laundering activities in Panama, according
to the indictment. Rodriguez-Contreras has since been assassinated
in Medellin, Colombia.
   The Tampa indictment was returned Feb. 4, 1988, the same day
Noriega was charged in a separate cocaine racketeering indictment
in Miami. Noriega's Miami trial has been set for March 5.
   Defense Attorney George Tragos said outside the courtroom
Thursday that he hopes Pretelt goes to trial in Tampa before
Noriega's trial ends in Miami. If they attempt to try Noriega with
Pretelt, he said, he'll seek a severance.
   If the government tries to call Pretelt as a witness in the
Noriega case in Miami, Tragos said his client would exercize his
Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify.
   Pretelt surrendered to U.S. agents in Panama Wednesday and was
flown to Tampa for the court appearance.
   ``He's a legitimate, successful businessman. People like that
can't live on the run. He realized that,'' Tragos said of Pretelt,
who faces a maximum penalty of 35 years in prison and fines
totaling $265,000.
   Noriega is accused of authorizing shipment through Panama of
400,000 pounds of marijuana in a legitimate load of banana-like
fruit called plantains.
   Convicted Tampa smugglers Steven Michael Kalish and Leight Bruce
Ritch have testified they paid $750,000 of a promised $4 million to
Noriega, Pretelt and Rodriguez to guarantee the shipment.

   Most Panamanians questioned in a poll
consider the U.S. invasion a ``liberation'' and want the troops to
stay as long as needed to establish order, according to results
released Thursday.
   Consultoria Interdisciplinaria en Desarrollo, a Gallup
associate, conducted the poll Jan. 5-13 among 1,304 Panamanians in
urban and rural areas.
   U.S. troops invaded Dec. 20 and smashed the regime of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who took refuge in the Vatican Embassy four
days later. He surrendered Jan. 3 and was flown to Florida, where
he is jailed pending trial on drug trafficking charges.
   ``The results of the poll show a Panamanian people that agree
with the military action of the United States in their country,
consider it a liberating act and accept with pleasure the
government of President Guillermo Endarsa,'' CID said.
   The organization said the poll was conducted in both rural and
urban areas to reach a cross-section of the population, but no
further details were given on polling methods, nor was any margin
of error specified.
   Of those asked, 89 percent said they felt the U.S. action was
necessary; in answer to another question, 86 percent said they
considered it a liberation; 88 percent said they saw it as
beneficial to Panama; and a similar proportion said they wanted the
U.S. forces to remain in Panama.
   Asked if U.S. bases should remain in Panama after the year 2000,
57 percent said they should and 18 percent said they probably
should.
   Under the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, Panama assumes full
control of the waterway on Dec. 31, 1999, and U.S. military
installations providing security for the canal must be closed.
   Of those polled, 87 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion
of Noriega; 10 percent said they had no opinion and 3 percent had a
favorable opinion.
   Ninety-one percent said they had unfavorable opinion of the
Panamanian Defense Forces and saw them as repressive.

   President Bush is winning near-record approval
ratings in polls as his first year in office draws to a close.
   Here are highlights of polls conducted by the three major
television networks in affiliation with major newspapers and
reported Wednesday and Thursday:
   _ABC-Washington Post: Of 1,518 adults, 79 percent approve of
Bush's handling of his job, six points better than President
Reagan's peak in the same poll.
   _CBS-New York Times: 76 percent of 1,557 people approve.
   _NBC-Wall Street Journal: 71 percent of 1,500 approve.
   A Gallup Poll earlier this month gave Bush an approval rating of
80 percent, the highest for any president at any time since World
War II. President Kennedy recorded a 77 percent rating at one point
in 1962.
   In November, an Associated Press-Media General poll of 1,117
adults found that 70 percent had a favorable opinion of Bush.
   The margin of error of all polls was about three percentage
points either way.

   Several hundred Contra guerrillas have
crossed into Nicaragua in recent days, raising fears they will
attempt to disrupt the electoral process leading up to the Feb. 25
elections, Nicaragua's vice foreign minister said Thursday.
   ``They're hoping to spoil the electoral process,'' said Vice
Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco at a press conference here.
``There are indications they're hoping to create irregularities,
prevent voting, create a series of problems.''
   Nicaragua's general elections are a key part of the Central
American peace process; the ruling Sandinistas promised a fair vote
in return for disbandment of U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas based in
Honduras.
   Tinoco also said President Daniel Ortega was not planning to
attend the Jan. 27 inauguration of Rafael Leonardo Callejas as
Honduran president.
   When asked if Ortega had bowed out to avoid a confrontation with
Vice President Dan Quayle, Tinoco said Ortega declined an
invitation because the Nicaraguan campaign is entering its final
month.
   Ortega is running for re-election at the head of the Sandinista
ticket; his major opponent is Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
candidate of a coalition of 14 opposition parties.
   Tinoco said the challenge facing the Sandinistas is to win
despite the terrible economic problems of the last 10 years,
problems the Sandinistas blame on U.S. hostility, including
sanctions and support for the Contras.
   With U.S. support, the Nicaraguan rebels refused to disband
pending the outcome of the elections. Both Contra and Sandinista
officials said Contra fighters infiltrated into the country in
October and November.
   Contra leaders said they were going to await the outcome of the
elections and did not plan to take an aggressive posture, but the
Sandinistas called off a cease-fire and fighting flared for a time
last November.
   Tinoco said the Contras were infiltrating the countryside and
would probably be able to affect or frustrate voting in isolated
areas, but he was confident the elections would be judged fair and
thought the United States would have no choice but to end its
support of the Contras.
   ``The presence of international observers will make it very
difficult for the government of the United States to say the
opposite of the truth,'' said Tinoco. ``The United States will have
no alternative but to recognize the result,'' even if the
Sandinistas win.
   Tinoco noted Nicaragua had played host to observers from the
United Nations and the Organization of American States for months.
   He emphasized the role of former President Carter, saying last
May's Panamanian elections lost their credibility when Carter said
supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega were commiting fraud.
   Tinoco said that even if the majority of Contra fighters wait
until after the elections, they will be allowed to return

   The Medellin cocaine cartel freed a
kidnap victim on Thursday who bore a memorized message for
President Bush repeating the drug lords' pledge to release all
their hostages and abandon their illicit trade.
   The cartel said Wednesday it had been defeated by Colombia's
antidrug offensive and would stop its activities in exchange for
amnesty. Bush, whose administration enthusiastically backs the drug
war here, retorted in Washington that drug traffickers' promises
should not be believed.
   ``We are going to release all of our hostages,'' the
Extraditables, an armed group representing the cartel, promised in
their message to Bush. The message was repeated from memory by
Roberto Toro Gonzalez, who was kidnapped on Dec. 14.
   In Washington, spokesman Sean Walsh said Thursday night that the
White House would have no comment on the cartel message to Bush.
   The 23-year-old merchant, son of a wealthy family that owns a
chain of stores, said in a radio interview that the Extraditables
made him memorize the message before chaining him to window grating
of a house in Medellin.
   Journalists from Colombia's two major radio networks, Caracol
and RCN, were tipped off by anonymous phone callers and arrived at
the scene shortly after Toro Gonzalez's captors drove off.
   Authorities estimate at least 18 people remain in the hands of
the cartel.
   The Extraditables' message indicated that Bush should view
cartel leaders as any other suspected traffickers willing to cut a
deal with authorities.
   ``If President Bush and the men of the ... (Drug Enforcement
Administration) do not believe the word of drug traffickers, why do
they negotiate with them and why do they let them testify against
other suspects?'' the message asked.
   The cartel apparently was referring to plea bargaining
agreements often made between drug suspects and U.S. authorities.
   Toro Gonzalez is the third Medellin cartel hostage to be
released since Wednesday, when the cartel freed Patricia
Echavarria, the sister of President Virgilio Barco's son-in-law,
and her daughter.
   The two, kidnapped in Medellin on Dec. 16, carried a communique
from the Extraditables conceding defeat by the cartel.
   Leading politicians said Thursday it meant the struggle was
almost over, but the press said the government must fight on.
   The government says the drug traffickers will have to surrender
to authorities and face the judicial system.
   Police using helicopters raided a new cocaine laboratory near
Santander, in Cauca state, 200 miles southwest of Bogota, and
captured one suspect, the national TV news program ``24 Hours''
reported late Thursday.
   It said the lab was capable of processing 6,600 pounds of
cocaine a month and that police seized more than 7,000 gallons of
chemicals used to process the drug in Wednesday's raid.
   The program showed videotape of the laboratory.
   Before the cartel's Thursday message was sent, Interior Minister
Carlos Lemos Simmonds said the government would not be tricked into
ending its antidrug offensive; and that under no circumstances
would the government negotiate with the traffickers or drop its
policy of extraditing suspects to the United States to face charges.
   Two Liberal Party presidential candidates, Ernesto Samper and
William Jaramillo, said in declarations published by El Tiempo
newspaper Thursday that the offensive had pushed traffickers into
an ``unconditional surrender.''
   Their optimism was shared by Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez, who has
repeatedly called for negotiations with the Medellin cartel.
   El Tiempo quoted Gomez as saying the Extraditables' Wednesday
communique was ``an important step toward peace.''
   But El Tiempo said in its lead editorial the drug war had not
ended and the concession proved only that the government offensive
was working.
   Thursday's headline on another Bogota daily, La Prensa, said:
``The war will continue.''
   El Espectador, the Bogota paper whose offices were bombed by
traffickers in September, called the concession another episode in
the traffickers' efforts to extort peace talks.
   The cartel has repeatedly promised to down arms and abandon the
cocaine business in exchange for a government pardon.
   Since Barco ordered the crackdown in mid-August, authorities
have extradited 13 drug suspects to the United States and killed a
leader of the Medellin cartel, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, in a
gunfight.
   The drug traffickers responded with a terror campaign that
killed 209 people, including 107 who died when a bombed jet crashed
outside Bogota in November.
   The Extraditables said earlier they would end their bombing and
assassination campaign and free a number of hostages. In the last
45 days, 85 people were kidnapped, and authorities said many were
held by the cartel.

   President Bush, boasting that ``all America
has triumphed'' in his first year in office, defended the Panama
invasion against critics and again prodded Congress to act on his
unfinished domestic agenda.
   Bush, who starts his second year in office on Saturday, spoke at
Constitution Hall at what amounted to a pep rally with Vice
President Dan Quayle, the Cabinet and more than 2,000 other top
officials who hold presidential appointments.
   Later, at a reunion of Bush campaign workers, he invoked
humourous memories of his 1988 drive for the presidency against
Democrat Michael Dukakis.
   ``Tonight, I really came over to thank you for one thing you did
not ask me to do: You never asked me to make a video riding in a
tank,'' he said, recalling a much ridiculed Dukakis campaign pose.
   ``The toughest part for me was the debates. Some time has passed
so I want to recognize my opponent,'' Bush said with a straight
face. ``He was strong, tough, tenacious and a real fighter, and I
gained a newfound respect for Dan Rather.''
   Bush also praised his vice president, saying, ``Nobody took more
heat and did a better job for our ticket and our election than
you.''
   Quayle, for his part, quipped to the crowd, ``It's hard to
believe that it's been over a year since George Bush rode to
victory on my coattails.''
   Earlier, in the Constitution Hall speech, Bush said that during
his first 12 months in office, ``all America has triumphed. ...
Looking back, it's been quite a year.''
   ``Just wait till the second-guessers see our second year,'' he
said.
   The Panama invasion that toppled Manuel Antonio Noriega was ``a
tremendous success,'' he said.
   ``Yes, there's going to be some second-guessing, Monday-morning
quarterbacks at work. But let's not forget, 92 percent of the
people in Panama supported `Operation Just Cause,''' said Bush,
using the Pentagon's catchy code name for the Dec. 20 operation and
referring to a CBS poll in Panama.
   Calling the Panamanian people ``our bothers and our sisters,''
he said, ``they deserve our help, and so do all our friends in
Latin America and the Caribbean. And they'll receive it.''
   While pledging that the United States will support democracy in
Eastern Europe, ``I will not neglect this hemisphere,'' Bush said.
   Bush said America was enjoying ``the longest peacetime boom in
our history,'' with low unemployment and moderate inflation.
   As he has in recent weeks, Bush prodded Congress to reduce
capital gains tax rates and enact his proposals on child-care,
clean air, public education and fighting crime. He called for
passage of the death penalty for cop killers ``not at some point,
not sometime, but now.'' In the past, the president has called for
such legislation both at the federal level and by the states.
   ``The agenda is unfinished. The public awaits,'' said the
president.
   Quayle, often a target of criticism from Democrats as an alleged
intellectual lightweight, received a prolonged standing ovation
including cheers and whistles when he preceded Bush on stage. White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu introduced Quayle as ``a key, if
not the key member of the Bush administration.''
   ``It's been a great year,'' said Quayle.
   ``President Bush has kept his promises to the American people:
no new taxes, peace through strength and the day of the dictator is
over,'' said the vice president, sounding three themes from Bush's
inaugural address.
   Bush cut short his own standing ovation from the crowd in the
Daughters of the American Revolution auditorium, quipping, ``I
wanted to stop the applause so you could get back to work.''

   Police arrested an avowed right-wing terrorist
Thursday in the shooting of Nagasaki's mayor, who had endured a
year of death threats after saying Emperor Hirohito bore some
responsibility for World War II.
   The shooting, said to be the first of an important politician in
this country since the war, outraged many Japanese and brought
calls to heighten respect for freedom of speech.
   Hitoshi Motoshima, 67, was shot in the back Thursday as he left
City Hall. He was reported in serious but not life-threatening
condition after surgery to repair damage from a single bullet that
pierced his left lung.
   The gunman escaped alone in a white car, but within five hours
police said they had arrested Kazumi Tajiri, 40, of Tokyo, in a
Nagasaki hotel. Tajiri admitted to shooting Motoshima and was held
on suspicion of attempted murder, said a Nagasaki police spokesman
who refused to have his name used.
   Tajiri was the leader of a rightist group with a record of
violence, Nagasaki police said, and the group had been active in
the campaign of intimidation that erupted in December 1988 after
the mayor spoke out on the late emperor's wartime role.
   In 1987, Tajiri appeared in a TV Asahi interview where he was
asked if he was willing to kill somebody he hated.
   ``Yes, because after all, right-wingers are terrorists,''
replied Tajiri.
   His group, called the Sane Thinkers' School, was the largest
rightist organization in Nagasaki, with about 30 members, police
said. It also had branches in Tokyo and Osaka. People who answered
the phone or the door intercom at its offices refused to speak to
reporters.
   Rightists have denounced the Nagasaki mayor since December 1988,
when he said that Emperor Hirohito ``shares responsibility for the
war, as well as all of us who lived in that period.''
   He said the emperor could have ended the war sooner and spared
Nagasaki from becoming the second city to be atomic-bombed.
Nagasaki was struck on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after Hiroshima,
and Japan surrended on Aug. 15.
   The comments came as the 87-year-old Hirohito was on his
deathbed. He died of cancer Jan. 7, 1989.
   Though the mayor's opinion is shared by many Japanese _ and
286,000 people signed petitions backing his statement _ it outraged
the fiercely anti-Communist fringe, which also venerates the
imperial family.
   Rightist groups mounted a public campaign of intimidation, by
convoys of sound trucks circling Nagasaki City Hall blaring ``Death
to Motoshima!''
   The mayor received three anonymous letters with bullets. A
Nagasaki doctor was convicted of sending those letters and
sentenced to two years in prison. A young rightist was arrested in
City Hall carrying a knife, saying he intended to force Motoshima
to recant.
   Soon after the controversy erupted, Motoshima said in an
interview that he hadn't thought there would be such an uproar over
his opinion.
   ``I guess the real mistake was I waited to say it until now,''
he said.
   Motoshima, a Roman Catholic, said he had been bullied in school
and in the wartime army, in which he was a military instructor,
because he could not accept the doctrine then that the emperor was
divine.
   ``When I was asked by my superior in the army about which is
more to be respected, the emperor or Jesus, I answered `both' and
was punched badly,'' he said.
   Hirohito renounced his divinity after the war. During it, most
historians say, he was a figurehead, with militarists in the
government making the decisions. But some critics claim he played a
more active role, and the emperor himself declined to shed much
light on the issue.
   Motoshima is an independent conservative. Formerly supported by
the long-governing Liberal Democrats, he has been estranged from
the party since the controversy arose.
   After he was shot, the government and other Japanese decried the
clear threat to freedom of speech.
   ``It's an extremely cruel crime, and it will have a strong
impact on society,'' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Mayumi Moriyama,
speaking for the government.
   Newspapers have been hit repeatedly by the rightists. An attack
on an Asahi Shimbun office in 1987 killed one reporter and wounded
another.
   ``Coupled with the fact that culprits responsible for a series
of attacks on offices of the Asahi Shimbun have yet to be uncovered
by police, (the shooting) reminds us that our society still remains
vulnerable to a nightmare of terrorism against freedom of speech,''
the Asahi said in an editorial in Friday's edition.
   Free speech is guaranteed in Japan's postwar constitution, but
those who exercise it in ways that arouse the rightist fringe must
be braced for intimidation by threats and the convoys of extremist
sound trucks.
   National police said its records showed 25 attacks on prominent
politicians since World War II, but all were by knives, swords,
explosives or fists _ not guns. Japanese law bans possession of
handguns, though the criminal world and rightists seem to have them.

   Veronique Le Guen, a cave explorer who set a world
record after living in underground isolation for 111 days, died of
an overdose of barbiturates, police said Thursday. She was 33.
   Her body was discovered late Thursday in a car in northeastern
Paris, said police, who called the death a suicide. There was no
indication how long Ms. Le Guen had been in the car.
   Ms. Le Guen descended into a cavern 260 feet underground on Aug.
10, 1988, near Millau in southern France, equipped with 264 gallons
of water, 900 books and crates of canned and frozen foods.
   She wore no watch and bore no other instrument to determine what
time or day it was or what was taking place above ground.
   A pale but healthy Ms. Le Guen returned to the surface on Nov.
29, 1988, eclipsing a 20-year-old record set by Josie Laures, who
stayed underground for 88 days.
   Ms. Le Guen had said her fondest memory during the ordeal was
reading ``One Hundred Years of Solitude,'' a bestselling book by
the Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
   She said she grew to like her damp surroundings and talked to
stalactites. The only sound around her was that of dripping water,
and her only contact with the outside world was a telephone.
   ``The calls put into my ears the sounds of people living without
me, in the free air,'' she said. ``I missed that and felt bad about
it.''
   Upon leaving the cave she said she felt the joy of being
reunited with her family and ``a poignant sadness at leaving this
cave which I'd become attached to after all.''
   In a book on her experiences that was published last summer,
``Alone at The Bottom of The Pit,'' she described the stress
brought about by the long isolation and her fear of sleeping and
``staying in hibernation.''
   No funeral service was immediately announced.

   Gov. Rose Mofford announced Thursday that she
won't be a candidate this fall to extend the term in the office she
inherited after the impeachment of former Gov. Evan Mecham.
   The 67-year-old Democratic governor made the announcement on her
first day back at work after undergoing surgery Dec. 18 for removal
of her gallbladder, but she said her health was not a factor in her
decision not to run.
   Mrs. Mofford, a government employee for almost 48 years when her
elected predecessor's impeachment elevated her from secretary of
state to governor in 1988, said she realized while lying in her
hospital bed that there were many things she could do only after
retiring.
   ``There are so many things I want to do that I don't think there
is time left in my life to do all off them,'' she said. ``I feel
this one I have to call for Rosie.''
   Mrs. Mofford has been plagued by medical problems as well as by
political critics since she became governor.
   ``I've served Arizona long and hard and I think I have done an
outstanding job for 50 years,'' Mrs. Mofford said.
   ``I'm not tired,'' she said. ``I wish I had 50 years to go.''
   She said she decided to make her announcement now ``to end all
of the speculation.''
   Mecham and several other Republicans have already announced
their intention to run for governor this fall, but other Democrats
have steered clear of the contest, deferring to Mrs. Mofford.
   Two Democrats often mentioned as possible candidates if Mrs.
Mofford decided not run have been Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard and
Chief Justice Frank Gordon Jr. of the Arizona Supreme Court.
   Gordon presided at the Senate impeachment trial where Mecham was
ousted, elevating Mrs. Mofford from her elected but largely
ceremonial post as secretary of state.
   Soon after becoming governor, Mrs. Mofford suffered a concussion
in a fall from a platform. She also underwent treatment for
cataracts and headaches, and was hospitalized for gallbladder
surgery Dec. 18.
   Doctors predicted she could be back at work quickly, and Mrs.
Mofford gave an abbreviated State of State address Jan. 8. But she
has not been in the office since.
   She has been criticized for a hands-off style of government and
lack of leadership. Particularly damaging was a recent instance in
which she commuted prison sentences of two murderers and later
rescinded the commutations, saying she didn't realize that victims'
families had not been notified.
   Mrs. Mofford went to work in 1941 as a secretary in the state
treasurer's office and never left state government. She was
appointed assistant secretary of state in 1955, and 22 years later,
when then-Gov. Raul Castro was named U.S. Ambassador to Argentina,
she was chosen to succeed her boss, Wesley Bolin, who became
governor.
   She went on to win election to the office in 1978, 1982 and
1986, winning each time by large margins.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Macbeth' with Raul Julia Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any production of ``Macbeth'' with as
interesting an actor as Raul Julia in the title role should be home
free. The New York Shakespeare Festival's revival, now on view at
the Public Theater, is about halfway there.
   The best thing about it is Julia, who plays the renegade
Scottish king as a fearful monarch driven by a desire to be found
out, rather than as a symbol of pure evil.
   Watch his eyes. And you can in the small, tightly enclosed
playing area in the Public's Anspacher Theater. They are forever
darting, never resting on one person or another. But the looks get
more steely, more crazed as the killings go on, and Macbeth tries
to consolidate his power.
   Julia negotiates the big soliloquies _ and this play is chock
full of them _ with skill. His voice is strong, resonant; his
manner thoughtful. There's even a hint of dark humor as he
gradually gets caught up in the bloodletting and accepts it as
inevitable.
   But he has little rapport with Melinda Mullins, a disappointment
as Lady Macbeth. She's supposed to be the instigator, the cheering
section leading Macbeth on to those terrible deeds. But her support
and cajoling is more shrewish than savage. And she has a tendency
to become strident in the play's most emotional moments.
   Richard Jordan's straightforward direction is workman-like,
almost tentative. Still, there are some striking moments. Banquo's
ghost is a quite literal apparition _ a walking zombie doused in
blood. And when Macduff learns about the death of his wife and
children, he pulls a hood over his head in grief.
   But other moments don't quite work. The three witches are
reduced to a cackling Greek chorus which sporadically watches the
action from behind a long wooden fence. The battle scenes are
strenuously athletic. In fact, they are so exuberant and
freewheeling that you fear for theatergoers sitting in the front
rows.
   Most of the supporting cast is strong, particularly Larry
Bryggman as the doomed Banquo, Thomas Gibson as a boyish, eager
Malcolm and William Converse-Roberts as the passionate Macduff.
   ``Macbeth'' is Shakespeare's most desolate play, a bleak
rumination on the nature of evil. You won't be surprised or
startled by the production. But there's always Julia's intelligence
at work to keep you absorbed. He makes that evil seem very human
indeed.

   Playwright Charles Fuller has staked a claim to a large segment
of black history in ``We,'' the collective title for his ambitious
five-play project set in the last half of 19th-century America.
   Fuller's third effort in the series, entitled ``Jonquil,''
arrived over the weekend under the auspices of the Negro Ensemble
Company at off-Broadway's Theater Four. ``Jonquil'' is the best so
far, more dramatic and coherent than its predecessors, although it
retains their episodic nature. Still, one longs for more character
development.
   In the play, set in South Carolina right after the Civil War,
Fuller deals with efforts by former slaves to exercise their
hard-earned right to vote. The title character is a blind black
woman who still works for a white family. But most of the action
concerns Calvin, a fledgling black politician who preaches a policy
of passivity, and his wife Sally.
   You don't need to have seen the first two plays in the series,
``Sally'' and ``Prince,'' to fully appreciate ``Jonquil,'' but it
helps. This third play is riddled with references to people in the
earlier works.
   The direction by Douglas Turner Ward is equally sketchy. The
actors try to fill in the blanks but have little material to work
with. Only Iris Little as Sally manages to create a flesh and blood
character during this bare bones evening.

Caucasus that has killed at least 66 people and wounded more than
220.
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said the additional troops were
necessary to maintain order and possibly enforce a curfew _ a
measure authorities in the republic of Azerbaijan have refused to
impose despite reports of vicious attacks by Azerbaijani extremists
on Armenian residents.
   At least 10,500 Armenians reportedly have been evacuated from
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, where rampaging Azerbaijani mobs
began the violence Saturday.
   Extremists have obtained heavy weaponry, including helicopters,
tanks and ground-to-ground missiles in what Interior Minster Vadim
Bakatin on Thursday called a ``civil war.''
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov told ABC-TV's ``Prime Time Live''
early Friday that ``the number of people killed as compared to
Saturday and Sunday is now decreasing, in fact almost none.
However, the mood among a certain part of the population is still
very tense.''
   In his first public comments since the Baku riots, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev defended the Kremlin's decision Monday to
declare a state of emergency but said the ethnic problems date back
centuries.
   ``The problems, which have been accumulating for tens, no, for
hundreds of years, have erupted and acquired the character we are
now confronted with in the Baltics, Moldavia and now in such forms
this interethnic strife are going on in Transcaucasia, in
Azerbaijan and Armenia,'' he told a meeting in Moscow.
   ``We are now busy trying to halt this process, to prevent it
from going deeper and getting more acute,'' Gorbachev said in
comments broadcast on state radio. ``We have resorted to the use of
force against criminals, against this vandalism.''
   It was not clear whether the Kremlin intended to impose the
curfew in Baku and other parts of Azerbaijan, or if Yazov expected
the Azerbaijani authorities to do it.
   Members of the Azerbaijani People's Front said Thursday they had
warned Moscow that if a curfew or martial law were imposed on Baku
they would launch a general strike in the strategic oil center.
   On Wednesday, the 29,000 troops already in Azerbaijan and the
republic of Armenia were authorized to shoot if necessary to stop
the bitter fighting in the hills around the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh, according to Soviet media.
   Foreign reporters were barred from travel to the republics.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian enclave inside
Azerbaijan, officials expanded an existing curfew by two hours
Thursday, said Tass, the official Soviet news agency.
   The military commandant in Nagorno-Karabakh also ordered
unregistered organizations dissolved, Tass said.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a top-ranking Soviet legislator, confronted a
mass anti-government demonstration outside the Azerbaijani
Communist Party headquarters in Baku and said the riots had to
stop. The demonstrators called for the liquidation of Soviet power
in Azerbaijan and the resignation of the Azerbaijani leadership,
reported Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow.
   Soviet authorities sent 5,000 army troops into Azerbaijan
Tuesday. Interfax said Thursday there are also 24,000 Interior
Ministry troops in the two southern republics 1,250 miles southeast
of Moscow.
   Extremists in Azerbaijan have blockaded highways, interrupting
the movement of troops and halted 136 freight trains, including
three carrying military equipment, Interfax said.
   Yerevan, the Armenian capital, was reported to be running out of
fuel because of the Azerbaijani blockade. Armenians countered with
a blockade of Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave inside Armenia,
Interfax said.
   Yazov said more troops were needed because the area was so large
and ``the people in literally all towns and all populated areas
have been roused by these events,'' according to Radio Moscow.
   Yazov did not specify how many reserve soldiers had been called
up. He said men were being called up from ``neighboring regions,''
but did not specify. Tass said the men had recently completed their
compulsory military service.
   Yazov said he understood reservists would be unhappy about his
move but emphasized that they are not going with ``the task of
killing, shooting, going onto some offensive. It is principally to
protect public order.''
   He said the reservist call-up was needed in part because recent
cuts under Gorbachev's plan to slash the nation's armed forces by
500,000 men have depleted the forces that can be moved to the
Caucasus.
   Extremists besieged the Interior Ministry department in the town
of Masali for two hours, Interfax reported.
   ``Hundreds of trucks with Armenian militants patrol the border''
with the Lachin and Kubaltin regions of Azerbaijan, Interfax said,
and troops have been reinforced.
   Interfax also said thousands also rallied in Nakhichevan on
Wednesday to protest plans to rebuild border defenses and string
barbed wire along the middle of the Araks River, the border with
Iran.
   Hundreds of Azerbaijanis have crossed the river illegally in
recent weeks to visit relatives and demand removal of the border
barriers.
   Detailing the difficulties facing units sent to the Caucasus,
Radio Moscow said one transport plane arriving with troops had been
immediately seized by Armenians fleeing the fighting who demanded
to be flown to safety.
   Pickets continued at two military airfields in Azerbaijan and
attempts were made in Baku to block streets, Interior Ministry
spokesman Dmitri Seleznev said.
   He said the death toll in the ethnic bloodshed was up to 66 from
the 58 reported Wednesday, and that 220 people had been wounded.
   In the past 24 hours, he said, 4,658 more Armenians had been
evacuated from Baku and 45 ethnically motivated attacks were
reported there.
   In the Azerbaijani enclave of Nakhichevan, 3,000 Armenians
blockaded the village of Kerki, defended by 30 residents who were
aided by 50 soldiers, Seleznev said. He said there had been
shooting but no deaths.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev dispelled rumors the
Soviet borders with Iran and Turkey had been sealed, saying that as
far as he knew the border zone but had not been totally shut.
Tehran media reported that hundreds of people were crossing into
Soviet territory from Iran.
   In Armenia, the Interior Ministry official said, people
continued attacks on armories to steal weapons. During the 24-hour
period, 198 more weapons were seized including four armored cars
and a T-34 tank.

   The McMartin Pre-school molestation case was
the longest criminal trial in U.S. history. Here is a chronology of
the case:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Aug. 12, 1983: Judy Johnson makes a phone call to Manhattan
Beach Police Department and tells Detective Jane Hoag that she
believes her 2{-year-old son was molested by Raymond Buckey at the
McMartin Pre-School.
   _Sept. 7, 1983: Ms. Hoag arrests Buckey, but he is released
later that day for lack of evidence. Police continue the
investigation and stir controversy by sending letters to 200
parents naming Buckey as a child molestation suspect and asking
them to interrogate their children about oral sex, fondling of
genitals and sodomy.
   _Fall of 1983 to spring of 1984: Nearly 400 children are
interviewed by Children's Institute International, and 41 are
listed as victims in a complaint filed by the state.
   _Feb. 2, 1984: KABC-TV reporter Wayne Satz, in a newscast,
describes dozens of alleged acts of oral copulation and sodomy with
children.
   _March 22, 1984: Public outcry prompts Los Angeles District
Attorney Robert Philibosian to send the case to grand jurors, who
indict Buckey; his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey; his sister, Peggy
Ann Buckey; his grandmother Virginia McMartin, and three employees,
Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty Raidor, on 115 charges
of child molestation.
   _March 24, 1984: All seven defendants are arrested and jailed.
Buckey and his mother are held without bail. Bail for he others
ranges from $50,000 to $350,000. Lael Rubin, Christine Johnston and
Glenn Stevens are assigned to the prosecution team. Stevens is
later removed for expressing doubts about evidence, and Ms.
Johnston asks for reassignment.
   _April 20, 1984: The seven defendants plead innocent at an
arraignment, during which they are charged with sexually abusing 18
children over 10 years and using death threats to silence them.
   _June 6, 1984: A preliminary hearing starts with Municipal Judge
Aviva K. Bobb presiding. Thirteen of the 41 alleged victims chosen
from CII interviews take the stand during the 18-month hearing.
   _Jan. 22, 1985: The first child witness in the preliminary
hearing testifies that he and other pupils played ``naked games''
and that he had been touched on his genitals by some of the
defendants.
   _Jan. 9, 1986: Judge Bobb orders all seven defendants to stand
trial in Superior Court on 135 counts of molestation and
conspiracy, ending the longest preliminary hearing in California
history. The cost of the hearing was estimated at $4 million.
   _Jan. 17, 1986: District Attorney Ira Reiner says there is
insufficient evidence to warrant a trial for five of the seven
defendants and asks dismissal of charges against Virginia McMartin,
Peggy Ann Buckey, Mary Ann Jackson, Babette Spitler and Betty
Raidor. The remaining defendants, Buckey and his mother, still face
100 counts of molestation and conspiracy.
   _Jan. 23, 1986: Mrs. Buckey is released on $295,000 bail,
reduced from $495,000.
   _Dec. 19, 1986: Judy Johnson, the mother who made the first
allegations against Buckey, is found dead, naked and face down in
her home, at age 44. The coroner says she died of fatty
metamorphosis of the liver, an ailment commonly found in alcoholics.
   _April 20, 1987: The trial begins with jury selection. By July
1, 12 jurors and six alternates are chosen from 500 prospective
panelists.
   _July 13, 1987: Opening statements begin after efforts to move
the case elsewhere are quashed by Superior Court Judge William R.
Pounders.
   _July 29, 1987: The first parent to testify says his daughter's
behavior indicates she may have been abused at the school, but he
didn't recognize the warning signs at the time.
   _Dec. 10, 1987: Paul Bynum, 39, a former police officer who once
served as a defense investigator in the case, is found dead from an
apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
   _Oct. 17, 1988: The judge dismisses eight molestation counts
against Buckey and his mother. They now face a combined 65 counts
of molestation and conspiracy involving 11 former McMartin pupils.
   _Feb. 15, 1989: Buckey is released on $1.5 million bail after
being jailed nearly five years.
   _April 27, 1989: The trial, hitting the 2-year, 4-day mark,
becomes the longest criminal hearing in U.S. history when it
surpasses by one day the Hillside Strangler trial of Angelo Buono
in 1982-83.
   _May 16, 1989: Peggy McMartin Buckey takes the stand for the
first time and strongly denies she ever sexually assaulted her
students.
   _July 26, 1989: Buckey takes the stand and denies he has ever
molested children.
   _Nov. 2, 1989: Jurors adjourn to select a foreman and begin
deliberations. The eight-men, four-women panel must sift through
volumes of testimony from 124 witnesses.
   _Jan. 18, 1990: The jury acquits Buckey and his mother of 52
counts. The judge declares a mistrial on 13 other counts _ 12
against Buckey and one against both Buckey and his mother.

   The Navy plans to mothball the battleships
Iowa and New Jersey in a money-saving move that would leave only
two active battleships, a Defense Department official says.
   The Iowa, which was damaged in the April 19 explosion that
killed 47 sailors, would be repaired before being mothballed, the
official said Wednesday night.
   ``It's as good as done,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But he conceded that political pressure from New York City,
where the Navy had planned to base the Iowa, could cause another
ship to ``be thrown into the pot'' to replace that one at that new
base, now about 70 percent complete.

   The ballyhooed powers of oat bran are challenged
by a study today concluding this faddish food fails to lower
cholesterol after all.
   The idea that oat bran lowers the level of dangerous cholesterol
in the blood has been widely accepted in recent years. Some health
experts have recommended starting the day with a bowl of oatmeal,
and oat bran has become a common ingredient in muffins, cookies,
bagels, even doughnuts and potato chips.
   The new study found that people's cholesterol levels indeed go
down when they eat lots of oat bran, but it's only because they
also eat less saturated fat and cholesterol than usual.
   ``There really isn't any cholesterol-lowering property in oat
bran,'' said Dr. Frank M. Sacks, a co-author of the study.

   Older couples who drink coffee appear to
be more sexually active than elderly non-coffee drinkers, according
to a new study.
   In response to a survey, 62 percent of married women age 60 and
older who drank coffee said they were sexually active. Forty
percent of women older than 60 who do not drink coffee said they
were active.
   Among married men the same ages, 36 percent of coffee drinkers
said they sometimes were impotent, compared with 59 percent of
those who don't drink coffee.
   The study published in the January issue of the Archives of
Internal Medicine did not give a margin of error or date for the
survey of 744 Michigan residents done by Dr. Ananias Diokno of
William Beaumont Hospital in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak.

   The American Civil Liberties Union calls the
policy outrageous, but many youngsters at St. Sabina Academy and
their parents are proud the elementary school may be the nation's
first to test pupils for drugs.
   ``I care about the lives of these children,'' says the Rev.
Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina's Church. ``When you talk
about rights, if a child dies on drugs, he has no rights.''
   Twenty-five students in the sixth through eighth grades at the
all-black Roman Catholic elementary school on Chicago's South Side
are scheduled to take a drug test this week under the school's new
random drug-testing program.
   St. Sabina's school board approved the drug test program in
November after a survey showed that 210 parents favored it and only
five opposed it, Pfleger said.

   The Kremlin Wednesday authorized the thousands of
soldiers it sent to the Caucasus to open fire if necessary on
Armenians and Azerbaijanis fighting in the hills near the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Thousands of Armenian refugees poured from the southern republic
of Azerbaijan, many beaten or chased from their homes by angry
mobs. Some blamed the attacks on Azerbaijanis who earlier fled
ethnic violence in Armenia.
   The death toll rose to 58, mostly Armenians, and the number of
injured to 169 in five days of civil warfare, an Interior Ministry
official said.
   Four burned bodies were found in Baku, the capital of
Azerbaijan, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday. Eighteen
Armenian residents were injured in Azerbaijan in the past 24 hours.

   The Medellin cocaine cartel said
Wednesday the government has won the war on drugs, and it said it
would halt its terror campaign and stop dealing drugs in exchange
for a pardon.
   The cartel released two kidnap victims to back up its offer,
which was similar to previous proposals that have been rejected by
the government. The difference in this proposal was the cartel's
statement that it accepted defeat.
   The communique followed President Virgilio Barco's statement
Tuesday night that his government is not ``inflexible'' in regards
to a negotiated settlement with drug lords. Previously, Barco ruled
out talks.
   Barco, President Bush and the leaders of the cocaine-producing
countries of Peru and Bolivia have joined forces to fight drug
traffickers. They are expected to sign an accord to that effect at
a drug summit in Colombia next month.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will visit Panama,
Honduras and Jamaica this month, aides said Wednesday, but one
official said privately that other countries feeling resentment
about the U.S. invasion of Panama were discouraging Quayle visits
at this time.
   Quayle himself said that ``diplomatic sensitivities'' have held
up scheduling his trip to Central and South America. But he denied
any lingering ``deep resentment'' among Latin leaders after
President Bush's Dec. 20 invasion of Panama.
   ``No country has said, `We don't want the vice president,
period,''' he told a luncheon gathering of the Hoover Institution.
   However, Quayle later told a reporter, ``There are diplomatic
sensitivities. There's a matter of timing on when you go. There's a
matter of coordination. And these things have all got to be worked
out.''

   A tiny generator placed in the body to
deliver life-saving electrical shocks to the heart has dramatically
cut the death rate in people with heart rhythm disorders, a study
shows.
   Patients who have been given the device faced a 25 percent
chance of dying each year without it, and practically none would
have survived five years.
   With the device, 94 percent survive five years and 85 percent
survive 10 years, said Dr. Levi Watkins Jr. of Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
   Each year, 600,000 Americans die suddenly from heart attacks
that trigger abnormal heart rhythms, the American Heart Association

   Already meager meat supplies have
become critical and some communities have imposed short-term
rationing to fight hoarding by consumers long denied the bare
necessities, a top food official said Wednesday.
   Romanian Radio and government officials announced, meanwhile,
that trials would begin next week for six top henchmen of ousted
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, including the No. 3 man in
his government. Officials say the trials will be public and
nationally televised.
   Food shortages were widespread in the last years of Ceausescu's
24-year tenure because of a forced export drive aimed at paying off
Romania's multibillion-dollar foreign debt.
   Before Ceausescu's downfall Dec. 22, each Romanian was
restricted to 1.1 pounds of meat a week, and sugar, oil, eggs and
butter also were either rationed or unavailable.

<HEAD>Michael Caine Stars in ABC`s `Jekyll &amp; Hyde'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you like a good horror story, lavish
Victorian costumes, misty London streets with dark wet
cobblestones, and fine British acting, proceed Sunday to ABC's
``Jekyll &amp; Hyde,'' starring Michael Caine as both.
   A TV version of ``The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,''
Robert Louis Stevenson's novella about good and chemically induced
evil, it's a crisp, enjoyable bundle from Britain. It has but one
Yank in it _ Cheryl Ladd.
   She essays Sara, the lovely sister-in-law who becomes the object
of the widowed Dr. Jekyll's affections and Mr. Hyde's horrible
attentions. The former ``Charlie's Angels'' member speaks in a
passable British accent, but seems a tad old for the part. No harm,
though. She manages to fit in.
   While ABC's movie retells a familiar tale, it tells it well,
with writer David Wickes' burnished antique dialogue a joy to the
ears in this age of film-school graduate scripts that mainly
consist of burps, obscenities, and scenes stolen from
``Casablanca.''
   It's hard not to like a show where:
   _A powerful old doctor (Joss Ackland) hates Jekyll, suspects his
married daughter (Ladd) has taken him as a lover, and sternly asks
her, ``Has he seduced you, is that it?'' He later bellows
``Adulteress!,'' and orders her from his house, out, out, out into
the rain.
   _The crusty editor of the London Record who tells sleazy ace
reporter Ted Snape (David Schofield): ``Stay with it. I smell a
scandal brewing.''
   _Caine, as Jekyll teaching a class of medical students, calmly
tells them: ``Evil'' _ a short pause for effect _ ``is not a
scientific word.''
   None of this is camped up, by the way. While such dialogue could
collapse the show if done by actors of lesser skill, this cast
plays things straightforwardly and with care.
   It's sheer pleasure to watch them work, even those in the
smaller roles, such as Joan Heal as Jekyll's disapproving
housekeeper, and Lionel Jeffries as the doctor's irreverent father.
   Tautly directed by Wickes, who earlier teamed with Caine on a
not-so-good TV version of ``Jack the Ripper,'' Sunday's exercise
starts with an auction _ suddenly halted _ of the late Dr. Jekyll's
goods.
   We then learn of the plight of poor Sara, who has borne a son of
her Jekyll-Hyde days. She works as a stablehand and just wants to
be left alone. Of course there ensues a flashback to the whole
story.
   The tale is of the benevolent Jekyll's relentless
experimentation in drugs which, although he hopes it will prove for
the betterment of mankind, keeps turning him into Hyde, his
loathsome, grotesque, violent, murderous alter ego.
   Not only is Hyde (Jekyll rents a room for him in a seedy
brothel) the dark side of humanity, he also is, in his screaming
moments of transformation, a fine example of why we all should
``Just Say No'' to drugs.
   The doctor mixes and downs his terrible potion. In moments, his
hands thicken, his body contorts, his face swells and pulsates and
his features _ well, neighbors, this is Mr. Hyde, and he is plumb
gnarly.
   Back and forth from Jekyll to Hyde he goes, with Hyde nearly
killing a child here, savagely beating a prostitute there, setting
fire to a pub and finally killing a Scotland Yard detective who,
with a colleague, had joined th police search for him.
   The ring starts closing after Mr. Hyde assails the lovely Sara _
temporarily, then permanently, ensconsed in Dr. Jekyll's townhouse.
The good doctor tells her his bad secret and they fall in love.
   Worse, she remains mum when the constables come to investigate
her attack. The work of reporter Snape proves a catalyst in all
this, as does Jekyll's tormented bid to rid himself of Hyde.
   Caine may seem to appear in movies and TV shows at the rate of
one a day, but he rarely turns in a dull performance. He's in top
form throughout here, highly believable and showing no waste motion.
   His screaming, face-bubbling Hyde transformations may strike
some as old hat, but don't blame Caine. Blame Fox's old
``Werewolf'' series. Its weekly man-to-beast changes took the edge
off the normal-to-grotesque racket.
   Be that as it may, be sure to inspect ABC's two-hour ``Jekyll &amp;
Hyde'' on Sunday. It is horror, the good, old-fashioned, English
way.

   Elsewhere in television:
   DEBORAH DOES SECOND _ After her first full week as the new
co-host of NBC's ``Today,'' Deborah Norville and co-host Bryant
Gumble got bad news. For the second week in a row, their show was
second to ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   In the week ending last Friday, ABC's morning effort averaged a
4.5 rating and ``Today'' a 3.9. ``CBS This Morning'' was third with
a 2.6. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. The new ratings
came out Thursday.
   An NBC spokeswoman, alluding to the much-publicized exit of
longtime ``Today'' star Jane Pauley and Pauley's succesion by
Norville, said that ``any change like this takes a period of
adjustment.'' She said a similar ratings dip occurred in January
1982 when Gumbel succeeded Tom Brokaw on ``Today.''

   You spell it easy, he spells it eezi. You want
quick results, he wants kwik rezults.
   If you want to call the whole thing off, language buff and
activist Ted W. Culp probably would tell you to wait becuz victori
is inevitabel in this linggwistic endevor.
   Culp is the president and founder of the Internasional Union for
the Canadian Langwaje, which campaigns for reforming English into
Canadian _ he says Canadean _ as an international language.
   ``Half the battle is already won because people know that
reformation needs to be done,'' he said. ``There's a universal
recognition that there's a problem with the English language.''
   Culp declined to say exactly how many people belong to his
admittedly small organization, but he insisted that he has members
and contacts scattered around the world.
   And, if you're wondering why a reformed English should be called
``Canadean'' _ well, why not?
   ``All the other languages of the world are linked to a nation,''
Culp said. ``When they're linked to a nation, it removes any sense
of fear. The world needs an international language, but it needs
one that's rational.''
   Talking over coffee at a neighborhood fast-food restaurant, Culp
detailed why he thinks the soft ``c'' in English should be changed
to ``s'' as in ``sentense,'' why Czechoslovakia should have been
changed long ago to Checkoslovakia, why ``Fast as Flite'' on
trucking slogans reads just fine to him and why the large American
toy-store chain should change its name to ``Tois Ar We.''
   He puts out regular nuzeletters and has started a small
nuzepaper, The Times Ov Toronto, that has made it through three
four-page issues.
   ``We urj all owr reeders tu abandon the obsolete, anoying
english langwaje, and tu adopt the emerjing, rasional canadean
langwaje,'' an editorial calling for linggwistic chanj said. ``It
iz so eezi. ...''
   Culp, a gray-haired secondary schoolteacher, said he always was
interested in language and created his Canadian in 1987, the
centenary of the artifical language Esperanto that had been touted
as the way to an international communication.
   ``There's no sense creating a language that no one speaks,'' he
said of Esperanto and its late founder, the Polish philologist
Ludwig Zamenhof. ``That's the fatal weakness from which it will
never recover. ... It was just the wrong strategy.''
   ``Canadean,'' on the other hand, would take advantage of the
prominence of English as an international language but make it
easier for foreigners learning English who often are confused by
its spelling and grammar.
   ``Using the world's No. 1 language, you can read and understand
this,'' he said. ``In `Canadean' you must say what's there.''
   Culp said the rules for Canadian appeal to those who have
problems spelling as well as those with scientifically educated
minds who prefer their systems to be rational. The increasing use
of computers and computer languages can only help the move to
develop a more rational language, he said.
   Among the rules for ``Canadean'' are an alphabet with 25
letters, eliminating ``q'' from the current Latin-English alphabet;
the addition of a verb ``tu must'' as in ``yu must tu work,'' and
the elimination of all silent and extra letters.
   Culp conceded that his language work would have to be developed
over the long term.
   ``There's a tendency to linguistic conservatism,'' he said of
those reluctant to change. ``People say it's the richness of the
language, but it's very rich nonsense.''

   When Martin Galvin walked into the Irish
Northern Aid office one Saturday morning six months ago, it
basically was gone; the files, the telephones, the checkbooks, the
fax machine.
   All that was left were some rusty old desks. On his own desk,
Galvin found a message: ``Free State Traitor.''
   The office, he realized, had not been hijacked by British agents
or Protestant terrorists. It had been taken by other members of
Irish Northern Aid, or NORAID, an American group which supports the
Irish Republican Army's guerrilla war against British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   For two decades, NORAID has been the heart of the insular world
of American Irish nationalism, where ``Free State traitor'' _ a
phrase meaningless to most Irish Americans since the Irish Free
State hasn't existed for more than 40 years _ is a choice insult.
   The NORAID office's disappearance in July was the beginning of a
rift that has divided the IRA's American supporters into at least
three groups, cut its flow of dollars to Ireland and raised doubts
that Irish nationalism can ever win much support in the United
States.
   ``How can unity be brought about if the major victims continue
to snipe at each other?'' asked former New York City Council
President Paul O'Dwyer, who has long defended the IRA.
   NORAID was formed in 1970 by Michael Flannery, an old IRA
soldier who moved to New York in the 1920s. The IRA had been
dormant for years, but in the late '60s Protestant mobs attacked
Catholic civil rights demonstrators in Northern Ireland. When
Britain sent troops to keep order they quickly came to blows with a
revived IRA, which didn't want Britain in Ulster under any
circumstances.
   NORAID contributed millions to the effort. Although the money
ostensibly went to IRA soldiers' families, NORAID was widely
suspected of diverting funds for weapons. British politicians and
tabloids made NORAID a whipping boy.
   But NORAID never transcended its narrow base of Irish-born
Americans living in big Northeastern cities, and Sinn Fein _ the
IRA's political party and the conduit for NORAID funds _ began to
want more than money.
   The United States was a critical diplomatic and propaganda
battlefield, where the nationalist message had to reach a broader
audience. It had to focus on the present rather than the past.
Instead of lamenting the formation of the Irish Free State in 1921
_ a first step in Irish independence that nevertheless preserved
British rule in the North _ NORAID needed to emphasize British
human rights abuses and the material misery of the province's
Catholic minority.
   NORAID, however, remained little more than a loose federation of
groups with no regular meetings, dues or membership roll. It
centered on fund-raising events _ rallies, dances, testimonials,
pub socials _ and sales of T-shirts and raffle tickets. At the end
of 1988, NORAID agreed to try to broaden its appeal. Its executive
committee was expanded; Sinn Fein sent an organizer to the United
States; and more time and money was devoted to lobbying and
propaganda.
   The new emphasis suited Galvin, an articulate young lawyer, far
more than it did Pat O'Connell, its president. O'Connell, who
emigrated in 1961, is as uncomfortable with politics as he is
dedicated to fund raising.
   Americans, he says, ``are fed up with their own nation's
politics. They sure as hell don't want to get involved in Irish
politics. They only want to give money for the prisoners and their
families, not for political lobbying.''
   O'Connell and the Sinn Fein organizer clashed repeatedly, but
O'Connell no longer had the support of a newly expanded NORAID
board. So, one night in July, he and several supporters cleaned out
NORAID's Manhattan office. They opened a new one in the Bronx,
disconnected the NORAID telephone and replaced its listing with the
number at the new Bronx location.
   For a while, there were two NORAIDS. Galvin and NORAID's
executive committee took out a newspaper ad that denied a split yet
``reaffirmed'' that NORAID's address and phone number were the same
as ever.
   Finally, after prodding from Sinn Fein, O'Connell returned the
files and agreed to stop using the NORAID name.
   But the split widened in October, when a letter in New York's
two Irish weeklies charged that under Galvin and company, NORAID
``is being steered in a direction toward politics and away from its
original humanitarian objectives.''
   The 41 signers included leading dissidents, but the big surprise
was the first one: Michael Flannery, at 88 still the most respected
Irish nationalist in America. Flannery, it turned out, had quietly
resigned from NORAID in 1986 after Sinn Fein declared itself
willing to take seats in the Irish parliament, which he regards as
the equivalent of the illegitimate Free State parliament.
   A few days after the letter appeared, a meeting was called. But
Flannery angered some young, Irish-born participants by calling
Sinn Fein leaders ``Free Staters.'' They in turn yelled ``Up the
IRA!'' at Flannery, who had served in the IRA before his hecklers'
parents were born. Nothing was settled.
   Then IRA soldier Joe Doherty, who has become a hero to many
Irish Americans during five years in a federal jail in Manhattan,
in a statement denounced Flannery's ``misleading and reactionary
attack'' on Sinn Fein.
   Since then, the combatants have gone their own ways. Galvin and
NORAID have tried to regroup, O'Connell formed the Friends of Irish
Freedom, and Flannery formed the Irish Freedom Committee. He and
O'Connell are raising money, but it is unclear who in Ireland will
accept it since the IRA is aligned with NORAID.
   Everyone claims publicly to harbor no animosity, a facade that
cracks easily.
   O'Connell says NORAID is crippled by the defection of most of
its most zealous workers, ``the people who will stand at a table
each Sunday selling T-shirts.'' Galvin ``loves publicity,'' says
O'Connell. ``He doesn't care if its good or bad; he just loves to
be on TV. But he can't raise money.''
   Paul Murray, an Albany businessman who is NORAID's new chairman,
calls O'Connell ``a pathological liar.''
   The squabble over who really leads the movement get a little
silly. For instance, O'Connell claims a NORAID fund-raiser in Lynn,
Mass., attracted only 92 people, while a Friends of Irish Freedom
function in nearby Malden attracted 400. NORAID says it was the the
other way around.
   The IRA, meanwhile, apparently got lost in the shuffle. Because
of the interruption in fund raising, Murray says, less money and
food was sent to Ireland last Christmas than at any time since
NORAID was founded.
   To Flannery, it all seems familiar. ``We've had so many breaks
and splits, and every time it's harmful. That's the tragedy of
Irish history.''

<TEXT>
   The anti-communist revolutions in Eastern
Europe have yielded a bonanza for Israel in renewed diplomatic ties
and the Israelis hope it also means the end of training and weapons
support for Arab radicals.
   New openings toward Israel by countries that once firmly backed
the Arab cause ends a two-decade Soviet-bloc boycott of the Jewish
state imposed by Moscow after the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``We are now opening a new page in our relations with Eastern
Europe,'' said Yossi Ben-Aharon, a top aide to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary, who recently visited
Jerusalem, described the changes as ``irreversible.''
   ``The old order cannot be restored,'' the Jerusalem Post quoted
him as saying in an interview.
   But it remains unclear whether the renewal of ties will
translate into long-term diplomatic support for Israel in the
Middle East conflict.
   Horn indicated Hungary was more interested in flourishing
economic ties than the Middle East conflict. However, he said he
supported an international Middle East peace conference, a proposal
accepted by the Arabs but staunchly rejected by Shamir.
   ``The Eastern Europe of today is not as pro-Palestinian as
before, but if Israel continues its hard line toward the
Palestinians, we cannot expect to win the support of these
countries,'' said Moshe Zimmermann, a historian at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem.
   Palestinian analysts, meanwhile, acknowledged the Palestine
Liberation Organization suffered a diplomatic setback in Eastern
Europe because of its association with the overthrown communist
dictators. They said the PLO faced an uphill struggle to win the
support of the new leadership.
   ``The atmosphere is, to a certain extent, hostile to the
Palestinians,'' said Ghassan Katib, a prominent Palestinian
communist and West Bank university lecturer. ``We must establish a
dialogue with the these new forces.''
   Anti-Arab sentiment is especially strong in Romania where Arabs
were identified in revolutionary quarters as fighting in the ranks
of the hated Securitate secret police who sought to crush the
popular uprising against dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   In the meantime, the new Eastern European leaders are knocking
on Israel's door to renew ties cut in 1967. Hungary was first in
September, while Poland and Czechoslovakia are expected to follow
this spring. Romania never severed ties, although it supported and
trained Arab guerrillas.
   Israel never had relations with East Germany, but a senior
Israeli official said such ties were expected if, as seems likely,
the East Germans drop their refusal to accept moral responsibility
for the Holocaust.
   In light of East Germany's economic problems, Israel would be
satisfied with a token payment of reparations, the official said.
   Eastern European leaders are mainly driven by the need to rescue
their crippled economies, and Israel, a close ally of the United
States, is seen as an important mediator.
   ``They believe Israel can pave the way for improved economic
relations with the Western world,'' said Mark Heller, an analyst at
Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   But Israel is also seen as an economic partner in its own right.
Israeli exports to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union jumped to
$100 million last year, up 70 percent from 1988.
   The new Eastern European leaders, whose political survival
depends in part on their ability to end food shortages at home, are
especially interested in Israel's agricultural know-how.
   In December, the government-owned Israeli company Agridev signed
a cooperation agreement with Bulgaria under which Israel will
provide experts and equipment to run Bulgarian farms. A similar
agreement is expected to be signed with Poland.
   ``In the past year, many doors have been opened, due to the
changes in the political situation and the desire to supply enough
food,'' said Amram Olmert, managing director of Agridev.
   In addition to the diplomatic and economic windfalls, Israeli
officials cite a third beneficial development: an end to state
sponsorship of Palestinian terror squads.
   In the past, the PLO and other Palestinian groups maintained
close ties with Eastern Europe, especially Romania, Czechoslovakia
and East Germany which trained and armed hundreds of Palestinian
guerrillas, according to Israeli intelligence sources.
   ``These countries provided training, weapons, served as host
facilities for terrorist organizations and sometimes provided
sabotage materials,'' said Heller.
   Israeli intelligence officials noted that Eastern European
support for Palestinian guerrilla groups has considerably dropped
in the past year, a trend they expected to continue.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if that activity stopped completely,''
Heller said.

   James Crotty and Michael Lane don't wait to
return home to spin tales of their latest travels. In fact, they
don't return home at all.
   Crotty, Lane and their two cats have been on the road for four
years and 85,000 miles publishing a totally mobile magazine: Monk.
   They eat, sleep, travel and work in a 26-foot 1986 Fleetwood
motorhome. A solar-powered Macintosh computer is mounted on the
dashboard; ads are sold by Lane, 39, and Crotty, 30, from phone
booths. A mailing address described as a ``suite'' is actually a
5-inch by 10-inch postage box in Santa Fe, N.M.
   What started as a newsletter has turned into a magazine with a
circulation of about 30,000 and a cover price of $2.95 ($3.75
abroad).
   ``Monk is about life on the road. In each issue we describe the
latest segment of our travels and encounters with the lucky victims
of our latest pit stop. Everyone from dogs to dancers, vision
queens to country singers and occasionally, even real live monks,''
the two Monks wrote in their seventh issue, July 28. ``We are a
gentle tickle in the side of the earnest seeker, the frazzled
housewife and the corporate climber, though we can also be quite
useful. In fact, thousands of readers use our quarterly rag to
teach dogs how to fetch.''
   Lyrical, philosophical, kind of zany _ that's the kind of thing
readers expect from Monk and its founder-editors, New Age hippies
who held down a series of jobs in San Francisco before they
answered the call of the open road.
   ``We represent a new style of spiritual nomad who is not bound
by religious norms,'' they say, a kind of ``traveling soap opera,
flop house and nunnery all rolled into one.''
   Originally, they were fed up with rising rents. But Crotty said
the Monks' odyssey was also a quest for simplicity in their lives
and resulted from a ``burning desire to create a lifestyle that was
completely mobile.''
   ``That's obviously a dream of a lot of people or mobile homes
wouldn't be so popular. We were just a little more passionate about
that than most.''
   The magazine describes their adventures, in a
stream-of-consciousness, chatty, gonzo style. Occasionally, people
they encounter contribute articles.
   ``It's like Charles Kuralt with Jack Kerouac and they pick up
Laurel and Hardy hitchhiking and then go on an adventure,'' Crotty
said.
   Follow the Monks to New Mexico, where ``it's high, it's clear,
it's desert and it's peyote land.'' Follow them to the ``scene of
the crime'' _ White Sands Missile Range, where one of the first
nuclear test blasts occurred on July 6, 1945.
   Listen as the Monks expound on turbans, China Cola, the benefits
of geese in weeding farms, how Arkansas got its name and ``What You
Won't Learn Through The Arkansas Department of Tourism.''
   The magazine's advertisements offer all-natural sunscreens,
herbal toothpaste, the secret to instant memory, massage tables,
Indian-style ceremonial drums and ``The X-rated Bible.''
   With advertiser and reader support, the Monks break even.
Eventually, Lane hopes to distribute Monk in Europe and to travel
overseas. For now, they explore the United States, changing
directions on a whim.
   Last winter, they were in Minnesota and chose to go to Mardi
Gras in New Orleans. But the van slid off an icy road, and about 30
residents of the tiny village of Calico Rock, Ark. to emerge with
shovels. ``We almost lost the van and ourselves,'' Lane said.
``These people all came out and rescued us and helped us get
started. It was touching.
   ``Being on the road you have to open up to all people. There're
a lot of people traveling like us in vans but they would never have
these chance encounters because they will just stick to certain
tourist centers, or what's expected.''
   As a result, stereotypes crumble along the way.
   ``In the South we thought they were going to be a bunch of
bigoted racist rednecks, and though that exists, everyone you run
into is really open-minded. Most people everywhere are incredibly
friendly,'' Lane said.
   ``This is a simple journey that many people have carried out. We
just got very complex about it,'' Crotty said. ``We go to places
that are unheralded or to places that you dare not go with a motor
home, and Manhattan fits into the latter category. Absolutely no
motor home magazine will recommend that you go to Manhattan.''
   There is a reason, of course. While in Manhattan, the van was
parked in a garage. But that didn't prevent thieves from stealing a
bicycle from the Monks, who were last reported more safely
ensconced in North Bergen, N.J.

<HEAD>Rare Siberian Cranes Feared Shot Down over Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIJAY JOSHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BHARATPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fewer Siberian cranes are migrating to
their favorite wintering ground in the marshes of western India,
and some bird watchers fear they are being shot down over
Afghanistan.
   Only 17 cranes arrived this winter in the Keoladeo National Park
at Bharatpur, once a duck-shooting preserve of maharajahs and now a
sanctuary for more than 400 bird species.
   The small number cannot be ``taken lightly,'' since 24 cranes
came in the winter of 1988-89 and 31 the winter before that, said
V.S. Vijayan, a scientist with the Bombay Natural History Society
who has been working at Bharatpur.
   Indian wildlife officials and environmentalists agree with Jim
Harris, an orthnologist with the International Crane Foundation
based i Baraboo, Wis., that the birds may be falling victim to
gunners in Afghanistan's war.
   A Soviet scientist rejected the theory and other Indian
officials said recurring drought in Bharatpur may be contributing
to the declining number of arrivals at the sanctuary.
   The group gathered recently to discuss the cranes at the Bombay
Natural History Society office in Bharatpur.
   Ornitholgists know little about the red-beaked white birds that
fly more than 3,100 miles in about one month from their breeding
ground in the tundras of western Siberia to Bharatpur in Rajasthan
state in western India.
   A smaller flock migrates to Iran. The two flocks, perhaps
totaling fewer than 50 birds, leave the Ob River Valley in Soviet
Siberia in September or October, just as it is starts snowing. They
return in late February or early March.
   The India-bound flock probably makes only two stopovers _ in
Soviet Kazhakistan and in Afghanistan, according to Vladimir Flint,
head of the Soviet Union's Animal Protection Department at the
All-Union Research Institute of Nature Conservation and Reserves in
Moscow.
   No precise estimates are available of the number of western
Siberian cranes. Harris put the figure at fewer than 50, but other
estimates place it as high as 200.
   ``There is very little data about the birds,'' Flint said during
the session. ``We hardly know anything about them except that they
fly over Iran and Afghanistan to the marshes here.''
   Said Harris: ``And there are a lot of people with guns in
Afghanistan who are waiting to pull the trigger.''
   Since the birds are safe from humans in the inaccessible
Siberian tundras and in the sanctuary at Bharatpur, Harris added,
it is likely they are being killed during migration.
   ``I do not agree that the birds are being killed over
Afghanistan,'' said Flint. ``Our next goal is to know the whole
migration route and the dangers they face.''
   Prakash Gole, head of the Ecological Society based in Poona,
India, agreed with Harris that Siberian cranes may have been killed
in Afghanistan. He said other kinds of cranes were shot and sold
for meat in Afghanistan even before the war between the
Soviet-backed government and U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas
started in 1978.
   Harris also said a dead Siberian crane turned up last year at a
local meat market in Pakistan.
   The freshwater wasteland at Bharatpur, about 30 miles west of
the Taj Mahal in Agra, was declared a shooting preserve for local
maharajas and British colonial rulers in 1902.
   Bird shooting was outlawed here in 1972, and the marsh was
declared a national park in 1981.
   The park's director, K.L. Saini, said in an interview later that
the Afghanistan theory is ``an interesting one.''
   ``But it is highly likely that the frequent droughts in the area
may be the main reason for their decreasing number,'' he added.
``Until about eight years ago we used to have regular floods which
kept the marsh alive and produced enough food for the birds.''
   Another set of cranes, apparently no different from the western
Siberian crane, breeds in eastern Siberia and migrates to China in
winter. The eastern Siberian cranes are believed to number at least
1,400. Like the western cranes, they are considered endangered
species.
   Flint said the Soviets have initiated studies to genetically
compare the two species.
   ``But my guess is there will be no difference.''
   The declining crane migration is also worrying naturalists who
earn their living by conducting tours of the sanctuary.
   ``Everyone comes to Bharatpur to see the Siberian cranes,'' said
Udai Singh, who conducts tours. ``And when they stop coming here
even the tourists will stop and I guess we will have to close
shop.''
   Singh's one-day tours cost $100 for a Western tour group and
$7.35 each for Indian groups.

   A series of Associated Press stories that has prompted federal
reassessment of the $3.9 billion drought relief program of 1988
involved analysis of thousands of drought aid reports over the
course of seven months.
   Using a computer database, three AP reporters matched rainfall
data and drought payments in every county in 14 states selected
because of their 1988 weather conditions or the amount of aid
received. After picking 120 counties to study further, the AP then
used the Freedom of Information Act to request those counties' Farm
Entitlement Reports, summaries of all farms' participation in the
program.
   These reports from the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, more than 12,000 in all, showed what crops
were involved, how large the losses were, which farmers or
corporations were paid and how much relief aid was paid.
   ASCS records are not centralized, so reporters traveled to 22
county offices in eight states to examine the more detailed drought
program files of 346 farmers, also available under the Freedom of
Information Act. Most of the data never leaves the county office,
where payment checks are written.
   In addition, the AP interviewed 93 farmers who participated in
the program and agriculture experts from 21 states.

<HEAD>Bush's Cabinet Still Intact as Administration Begins Second Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The moderate, pragmatic Cabinet members
brought into office by President Bush are still at their desks as
the administration begins its second year, but if history is any
guide one or more of them will be leaving soon.
   Critics have targeted Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos as the
weakest link in the Bush Cabinet, and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh as probably its biggest disappointment.
   Yet, such criticism is no barometer of staying power.
   The surest bet at the start of Bush's second year is that his
administration will not follow the pattern of the Reagan presidency
when the first Cabinet official to depart was the secretary of
state, Alexander M. Haig Jr.
   Bush's secretary of state, James A. Baker III, is a long-time
ally.
   ``There is no doubt that James Baker is the strong man of the
Cabinet,'' said presidential scholar Stephen Hess of the Brookings
Institution.
   Year Two of an administration generally sees the first
departures from the Cabinet.
   Martin Durkin resigned as secretary of labor during President
Eisenhower's second year. Both John Kennedy and Richard Nixon lost
their secretaries of health, education and welfare in the second
year: Abraham Ribicoff for Kennedy and Robert H. Finch for Nixon.
   Jimmy Carter's original appointees, on the other hand, lasted
from his inauguration in January 1977 to July 1979, when he shook
up his Cabinet in a whirlwind game of musical chairs.
   Thornburgh has been in his position longer than any of the
others. He was named attorney general by Reagan in August 1988, and
was kept on by Bush. He had been governor of Pennsylvania and,
before that, an assistant attorney general.
   ``When he was appointed, I rejoiced,'' said Norman Ornstein, a
scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ``I
thought at that time that he had the potential to be a great
attorney general. He still has that potential.''
   But Ornstein and others said Thornburgh has not lived up to
expectations.
   ``He had a good reputation as a really broad-minded person, but
he has taken the narrowest perspective on national security,'' said
Landis Jones, a professor of political science at the University of
Louisville and former director of the White House Fellows program.
``I am a former Pennsylvanian and I would have thought he might
have been much better.''
   The attorney general has drawn criticism, particularly from
liberals, for steps to tighten control on public information from
his department and for legal moves he says are needed to protect
state secrets in Iran-Contra cases. He also was accused of
heavy-handed dealings with Congress in the unsuccessful fight to
have William Lucas confirmed as his civil rights chief.
   On the other hand, Gary Bauer, White House domestic policy
adviser under Reagan and now head of the Family Research Council,
said that ``basically conservatives, and certainly our group, feel
very good about him.'' And Amy Moritz, executive director of the
National Center for Public Policy Research, told the Heritage
Foundation in a recent survey, ``It's good to have an attorney
general with guts.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel dismissed criticism of
his boss as ``a lot of inside the Beltway chatter by people who
haven't taken the time to find out what's going on in the
Department of Justice.''
   Runkel called assertions that Thornburgh has difficult relations
with Congress ``absolute nonsense.''
   ``We got the biggest budget increase in the history of the
department out of Congress,'' he said. ``Congress doesn't give that
kind of money to people they don't have respect for.''
   However, the budget increase for the Justice Department could be
attributed to the congressional rush to support efforts to combat
drugs rather than a particular endorsement of the attorney general.
   Hess, a White House aide in the Eisenhower administration, said,
``One would have thought that Thornburgh, not only as a person who
has been an assistant attorney general in a previous administration
but been a very successful governor who had the usual fine antenna
of the politician, would have had a far less rocky first year than
he has had.''
   While Thornburgh is one of the most politically experienced of
the Cabinet, Cavazos, a former university president and medical
school dean, is one of the least.
   The Washington Post recently carried a front-page article headed
``Cavazos Gets Low Marks'' that quoted critical remarks by
educators about the education secretary's effectiveness.
   Cavazos responded by saying he remained ``committed to helping
George Bush be the education president,'' and White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, ``He has the job as long as he
wants it.''
   Still, there have been suggestions that he could be the first to
go.
   ``It is quite clear that Cavazos is the weakest in terms of
political support,'' said Ornstein.
   The low-key Cavazos suffers in some eyes by comparison with his
flamboyant predecessor, William J. Bennett, now director of the
federal drug control program.
   Hess described the Education Department as ``in many ways a very
modest agency'' but said, ``You can, as Bill Bennett proved, turn
it into a bully pulpit ... It just strikes me that this fellow
doesn't have those sort of skills.''
   Bauer said, ``The jury is still out on whether you are going to
get the kind of attention that I think you need to get if you are
going to put education on the front burner.''
   Bush's Cabinet consists of the heads of the 14 departments plus
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
and Carla Hills, U.S. trade representative.
   Bauer said conservatives, many of them skeptical of Darman
because of his long association with Baker, ``have been pleasantly
surprised that he has held the line on things like taxes.''
   As for Baker, many conservatives have never liked him, and they
still don't. In the Heritage Foundation survey, which asked five
conservative leaders to give report card grades to the Cabinet
members, Baker's marks ranged from C to D-minus.
   But then, conservative political consultant Craig Shirley said
in an interview, ``It may be one of those situations where, whoever
is secretary of state, conservatives aren't particularly satisfied,
because they don't like the State Department anyway.''
   Most observers interviewed expressed no strong views one way or
another on the remaining Cabinet members.
   ``Most of the Cabinet members have been out of sight most of the
time,'' said Robert Roberts, an associate professor of political
science at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va.
   David Caputo, professor of political science and dean of
humanities at Purdue University, said, ``Jack Kemp (secretary of
housing and urban development) has been fairly visible, but I think
some of the Cabinet members have taken a low profile.''
   Hess, a long-time student of presidential performance, said Bush
differs from Reagan and some of his other predecessors in how he
handles his Cabinet.
   ``He gives the Cabinet officer his head, a proper authority to
come up with the right solutions and the right management if he or
she is capable of it,'' he said. ``Very often the weight of the
White House staff under Reagan was the heavier one.''

<HEAD>Farming in City Shadow May Be One Way To Survive, Says Advocate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the cold light of statistics, a farm that
sells less than $40,000 worth of products a year is pretty small
potatoes. The big outfits are the ones that really count.
   It depends whose statistics are being looked at, and by whom.
Millions of city families depend on nearby ``small'' farmers for
much of their food, says Bud Kerr, director of the Agriculture
Department's Office for Small-Scale Agriculture.
   But despite his missionary zeal to convert mind-locked
bureaucrats and others about the growing worth of small farmers,
Kerr admits he is fighting some mighty impressive statistics.
   For example, in the 1988 calendar year farmers sold more than
$151.4 billion worth of crops and livestock, a record level of cash
receipts from farming operations in the United States. Livestock
accounted for nearly $78.8 billion, crops for $72.6 billion.
   Cash receipts are one of the most useful indicators of farm
production, in an overall sense. Big farms produce more and have
big receipts, small farms produce less and have small receipts.
   The latest analysis by the department's Economic Research
Service says that the largest farms _ those with annual sales of
$500,000 or more _ accounted for 36.6 percent of the 1988 cash
sales.
   A middle group of farms in the sales class of $100,000 to
$499,999 collectively accounted for 40 percent of the sales. Those
in the $40,000 to $99,999 category sold 13.6 percent.
   Thus, the larger farms _ those with sales of at least $40,000 a
year _ produced 90.2 percent of the crops and livestock that
Americans consume, plus huge quantities that are sold abroad.
   That leaves the smallest category, the ones with sales of less
than $40,000 a year, producing only 9.8 percent of the nation's
food and fiber.
   But Kerr and other USDA experts note that the smallest sales
category accounted for 1,554,000, or 70.7 percent, of the nation's
2.2 million farms in 1988.
   The ``commercial'' farms of more than $40,000 annual sales
represented only 643,000 farms, or 29.3 percent. The very largest
category _ those with $500,000 or more each year _ included only
about 30,000 farms, or 1.4 percent of the total.
   The largest farms produced 36.6 percent of the total farm
products sold in 1988, according to the figures.
   Kerr said it is sometimes easy to overlook the real structure
and impact of small farms when such statistics are recited. So he
recites some of his own.
   Small farms control one-third of all agricultural resources,
such as land, buildings, machinery and equipment, he said.
Small-farm families are major buyers of agricultural ``inputs''
such as fertilizer and other supplies, consumer goods and services.
   ``They contribute to the well-being of their rural communities
and are likely to be an integral part of the community where they
farm, supporting community schools, churches and other social and
civic activities,'' he said.
   One of Kerr's recent publications, ``Small-Scale Agriculture
Today,'' said that even in areas designated as metropolitan by the
Census Bureau, 90 percent of the land is actually rural and 40
percent of it is in farms.
   ``While farmers in the city's shadow face their share of
problems, they also can exploit opportunities that their country
counterparts might relish,'' the report said.
   By being close to city consumers, these metro farmers have
direct access to ready-made markets for high-value produce.
Overall, they account for 76 percent of the nursery and
horticultural crops sold; 67 percent of the vegetables, sweet corn
and melons; and 65 percent of the fruit, nut and berries.
   ``Ten percent of metro farmers sell directly to the consumer,
accounting for 60 percent of U.S. direct-marketing sales, and that
doesn't include direct sales of nursery and horticultural
products,'' the report said.
   The average metro farm, at 247 acres, is half the size of the
518 acres of non-metro farms, and about 60 percent are less than
100 acres. The number of metro farms increased 4 percent between
1974 and 1982, while non-metro farms declined 6 percent.
   Kerr said in his report it is important to remember that ``as
urbanization encroaches on rural areas, the appropriate response is
to adapt, not surrender.''
   One way to cope with city sprawl and development is to sell off
unproductive land and abandon ``land-extensive enterprises'' such
as grass pastures for livestock and then focus on high-value,
intensive production.
   ``It is better to make money on a small farm meeting consumers'
demands than to lose money on a big one growing `conventional'
crops,'' he said.

<HEAD>Timing of Social Security Tax Cut Proposal Turns Old Idea Into an
Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan shouted tax cut
in an empty theater and then left town. Nobody noticed at first,
but now his proposal to scale back Social Security taxes has become
the issue of the hour.
   It has the administration nervous, and it could give the
Democrats a tax cut to boast about _ even if they don't pass it _
as Congress reconvenes for its election-year session.
   And it isn't even new business.
   Indeed, when Moynihan, a New York Democrat, addressed the matter
months ago, it was in partnership with a Republican senator. Even
then he was repeating an old refrain of his.
   That went largely unnoticed, too.
   The revival, and the punch the issue carries these days, is a
lesson in the way the Washington echo chamber works, especially
during a holiday recess. Moynihan proposed the Social Security tax
cut at a news conference on Dec. 29, as the New Year's weekend
began. His was about the only show in town that day. He went abroad
soon afterward, and was traveling in Africa and the Middle East
while the proposal took hold as an issue.
   That happened during the quiet days of early January, with
Congress in the recess that ends Tuesday. The administration was at
work on the budget President Bush will present at the end of the
month, and the tax cut Moynihan proposed would have a major impact
on the deficit projected in that spending plan.
   The conservative Heritage Foundation issued a paper praising the
Moynihan tax cut. The liberal Institute of Policy Studies praised
it, too, as a boon to middle and lower income working people. So
did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It played well with business
interests because employers match the Social Security taxes paid by
their workers.
   The White House rejected the idea. ``Democrats seem to want to
fiddle around with the Social Security system,'' said Marlin
Fitzwater, Bush's press secretary. ``We do not.''
   Nice try, but it didn't settle the matter. Democrats started
talking about the Moynihan measure as a counterattack on Bush's
renewed bid for a cut in the capital gains tax, an alternative they
could press as a tax cut for the average American.
   There were signs of some Republican support for the tax cut, too.
   Off-balance, the administration finally figured out its own
counter-offensive Thursday, arguing that the Moynihan measure would
force an increase in other taxes and would lead inevitably to
future cuts in benefits.
   ``It's an effort to get me to raise taxes on the American people
by the charade of cutting them, or cut benefits, and I am not going
to do it to the older people of this country,'' Bush said.
   ``Let me tell you something,'' Vice President Dan Quayle said in
an interview. ``Cut these taxes the way that Moynihan is talking
about, you have got to cut benefits at some time.''
   The new Bush budget is to include plans to prevent the use of
Social Security reserve funds to offset other spending and thus
mask deficits _ the practice that got Moynihan started on the
subject. That would be done gradually, over at least two budget
years.
   Moynihan's tax surgery would force the issue by reducing the
reserves. The bill he is introducing would roll back a Social
Security tax increase that took effect Jan. 1, and lower the rate
in 1991. He said that would put the system on a pay-as-you-go
basis, limiting reserves and using the tax to pay benefits due now.
   In the process, it would undo measures adopted in 1983 to build
up the Social Security trust fund now in order to meet soaring
benefit costs that will come when the baby boom generation begins
reaching retirement age in about 20 years.
   Moynihan served on the commission that recommended that plan,
but he said it has been subverted by the use of the Social Security
reserves to underwrite spending and conceal the real size of
federal deficits. That's done by investing the reserves in Treasury
securities, which produces funds for other programs.
   And without the trust fund reserves, which offset $52 billion in
deficit spending in the last budget year, the government wouldn't
have come close to meeting its mandated deficit reduction timetable.
   Moynihan, chairman of a Senate subcommittee on Social Security,
said the way the reserves are being used now amounts to thievery.
His tax reductions would reduce Social Security revenues by $7
billion this year and by $55 billion in 1991.
   The General Accounting Office already had suggested a possible
tax reduction to ``eliminate the illusory buildup of reserves that
now represents little more than a mechanism for using the payroll
tax to finance the general operations of government.''
   Nearly nine months ago, Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., and Moynihan
joined in pressing that argument as the Senate adopted their
resolution saying that the trust fund reserves should not be
counted in deficit reduction calculations. The measure was approved
without dissent on May 3, but it was not binding and it was ignored.
   So, for all the stir, the Moynihan proposal is hardly a secret
weapon. The senator said last spring that if the indirect use of
Social Security reserves to finance current deficit spending wasn't
stopped, the alternative would be to cut the tax ``so the money is
not there to be diverted to inappropriate and, indeed, immoral
purposes.''
   He got yawns then. Now he's got an issue.

   It's been 20 years since transplant surgeons
gave a little boy's liver to Kim Hudson, unsure how long the
3{-year-old girl would last beyond the operation, indeed whether
she would last at all.
   Kim Hudson is now Kim Rasmussen, wife of an Air Force sergeant
and mother to three cats, three dogs and any other animal that
strays her way. Being the world's longest-surviving recipient of a
liver transplant is a distinction she'd just as soon forget.
   ``I don't like to talk about it,'' she said. ``I hate hospitals.
I do not like doctors that well _ I associate them with
transplants. It's all scary. I shake when I go in to get my blood
work. They thought I was going to pass out a couple months ago. I
hate it, and it doesn't get any better.''
   Every so often, when she's back in Polo, Ill., visiting her
parents, she's approached by well-wishing, curious folks. ``When
they start mentioning it, you know they want to start talking about
it. I just want to run.''
   Kim fears her luck will run out if she brags about her Jan. 22,
1970, transplant and how well she has done. Nevertheless, thoughts
of the transplant _ and the ever-present risks _ follow her
everywhere.
   ``I think about my health all the time. I pray every day I stay
healthy. I pray that it all keeps working.''
   Her family is used to her constant anxiety and refusal to
discuss anything even remotely connected to transplantation.
   ``She does so well, she feels it will somehow jinx her,'' said
Ethel Hudson, her mother. ``She knows a lot of other ones who have
died after getting back from it,'' said her father, Bob.
   Even Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the transplant at the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, can't explain Kim's
``uninterrupted good health for practically all the time since we
did her.''
   ``You could call it providential if you were inclined that
way,'' said Starzl, who is now at the University of Pittsburgh.
   Starzl performed the world's first liver transplant, in 1963, as
well as the 31 other liver transplants in Denver that preceded
Kim's. Only a handful of medical centers were transplanting livers
at the time.
   During that first decade, children had a 30 percent to 35
percent chance of living one year beyond surgery. For adults, it
was 10 percent.
   ``They were successful if they didn't die on the table ... and
got out of the hospital,'' said Paul Taylor, a transplant
coordinator who worked with Starzl at the University of Colorado.
   The Hudsons learned of those early efforts from an article in a
medical journal. Their daughter had been born with biliary atresia,
a blockage of the bile ducts, and time quickly was running out.
Family doctors advised against the risky, experimental procedure.
Relatives said they'd be killing the child.
   Undaunted, the Hudsons persuaded their doctors to send Kim's
medical records and blood samples to Denver. Ten months after her
name was placed on the waiting list in 1969, a matching liver was
found.
   By the time Kim received the liver and gall bladder of a
7-year-old boy killed in a car accident on Jan. 22, 1970, only four
of the 32 previous recipients still were alive. By mid-1975, all
four were dead.
   Kim lived on, though, followed by more and more survivors.
Twenty-eight of the 170 patients transplanted by Starzl through
February 1980, in fact, still are alive. For Starzl, each one was a
``moon walker.''
   ``Up until then, people with those diagnoses and those
conditions, really, they had no hope. This at least provided some
hope. As it turned out tangible hope,'' he said. ``Kim Hudson, I
think, was the symbol of all that.''
   The real breakthrough came in 1980, when Starzl began testing an
anti-rejection drug known as cyclosporine on liver transplant
patients. One-year survival rates soared, eventually settling at
today's 70 percent to 80 percent.
   As the number of transplants grew _ a record 1,680 nationwide in
1988 _ so did the number of those seeking treatment. As of Jan. 15,
834 Americans were awaiting livers, according to the United Network
for Organ Sharing.
   Cyclosporine, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for general use in 1983, now is being surpassed by an even stronger
drug. Known as FK-506, the Japanese drug is believed 50 to 100
times more powerful than cyclosporine. Starzl has conducted the
U.S. clinical trials since February 1989.
   Doctors hestitate to change Kim's medication, though, since she
has yet to experience organ rejection. As a result, she takes drugs
prescribed long before the advent of cyclosporine. As with any
anti-rejection drug, she must swallow her pills every day for the
rest of her life.
   There are side effects to all the drugs, which help prevent
rejection by suppressing the immune system and thereby increase the
risk of infection. So far, Kim's only major side effect has been
cataracts. ``It's nothing to worry about,'' she said. ``I'm not
going to get myself all worked up.''
   Kim goes out of her way to avoid germs and sick people. She was
particularly careful in Okinawa, where her husband, Curt, 24, was
stationed for three years. He was transferred to McConnell Air
Force Base, Kan., last summer, and the couple just bought a house
in nearby Derby. She works part time at the base commissary. The
rest of the time she spends with her animals.
   ``I enjoy life,'' she said. ``But ... it gets scary like when
people get around me and they're sick. I've been real lucky.''
   She plans to celebrate the 20th anniversary quietly by going out
to dinner with her husband, and has but one wish: ``I hope I live
to be an old lady.''

<TEXT>
   Students _ not scientists _ will harvest
whatever discoveries are yielded by 12.5 million tomato seeds the
space shuttle Columbia returned to Earth aboard the rescued Long
Duration Exposure Facility.
   The seeds contributed by Park Seed Co. of Greenwood were sent
into space in 1984 aboard the LDEF, a 21,400-pound satellite
intended to study how materials, systems and products withstand
long exposure to conditions in space.
   The satellite was to have been retrieved after 10 months, but
scheduling problems and the 1986 Challenger disaster delayed
retrieval. Atmospheric drag had been pulling the satellite toward
Earth about a half-mile a day; if it had not been retrieved Jan. 12
by Columbia astronauts, it was expected to fall to earth about
March 9, destroying the 58 scientific experiments.
   ``You can imagine that the scientific community would like to
get their hands on the material,'' said Jim Alston, Park's research
director. Instead, it will package the surviving seeds into 150,000
experiment kits for schools. ``We don't want professional
scientists pre-empting what the kids will find.''
   Researchers expect some mutations, Alston said, but ``We really
don't know what to expect as results. The question always comes up,
`Are we going to have killer tomatoes or anything like that?' No,
that's not going to happen.
   ``There's 12.5 million seeds; there can be any number of
mutations. There's also the possibility a very desirable plant or
characteristic will pop up that can be developed for a commercial
release, or a new tomato type or something.''
   The seeds will be delivered to elementary and secondary schools
and colleges chosen by NASA. The schools will be asked to submit
experiment results to Oklahoma State University, which will publish
a report on the findings.
   ``If our dreams come true, we'll have about 4 million school
kids participating in this project towards the end of this
semester,'' Alston said. ``The (schools) that do send in the report
will get a certificate from NASA. The more that do report, the
better our database will be.''
   Park Seed also placed aboard the LDEF an additional 1.9 million
seeds of 106 varieties for its own experiments. It will study
growth rates, percentage that failed to survive and the fruits,
vegetables and plants the seeds produce.
   The produce from the seeds will be edible because they're ``not
picking up enough residual radiation to be any problem,'' Alston
said. ``In fact, there probably will be no more than here on Earth
right now.''
   It is not the first time Park Seed has been involved with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. One of the nation's
largest mail-order seed companies, Park Seed participated in a 1983
shuttle experiment, prompting the chief scientist for this mission
to ask the company to devise a project involving a large number of
students.

   America's trade deficit widened to $10.5
billion in November, its worst showing in 11 months, as U.S.
exports took a tumble caused in part by a strike at Boeing Co.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that while imports dipped
slightly from an all-time high set in October, U.S. exports sales
declined even more, falling to their lowest level since last March.
   As a result, the trade deficit, the difference between imports
and exports, rose 2.4 percent.

   Industrial production rose a strong 0.4

in late November returned production there to normal the following

<HEAD>Groupe Bull Announces Plans for Zenith Acquisition, New Model</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Groupe Bull, the French computer company that
bought the computer business of Zenith Electronics Corp. in late
December, says it plans to keep the Zenith operation a separate
division with its own identity.
   ``Zenith Data Systems will be our PC arm, with responsibility
for microcomputer product marketing and development on a worldwide
basis,'' said Francis Lorentz, Groupe Bull's chairman and chief
executive.
   Groupe Bull also announced Wednesday a series of management
changes. Under them, Roland Pampel, president and chief executive
of Bull HN Information Systems Inc., was named chairman of Zenith
Data Systems as well as senior executive vice president of Groupe
Bull.
   Pampel, 54, previously was president and chief operating officer
of the former Apollo Computer Inc. Bull HN Information Systems is
Bull's other U.S. computer division, which consists primarily of
the former Honeywell computer line.
   In addition, the French company unveiled a new logo for the
Zenith division that incorporates the Zenith name _ but not the
zigzag ``Z'' used by Zenith Electronics Corp. _ with Bull's
stylized tree logo.
   Bull said it would keep Zenith Data Systems' headquarters in
suburban Chicago and its manufacturing plants in that area and in
St. Joseph, Mich.
   With the addition of Zenith Data Systems, Bull says it now has a
complete product line, ranging from Zenith's popular portable and
desktop computers to Bull's existing powerful mainframes.
   Analysts have generally praised Bull's purchase of Zenith's
well-regarded computer division, which was announced in October and
completed last month. They say it was a savvy move by Bull to
extend its product line.
   ``I think if Bull manages it right they're going to have a
winner here,'' said Bob Tasker, an analyst for the research firm
International Data Corp.
   Tasker said that before the purchase, Bull was weak in the
desktop market. In addition, he said, the Zenith acquisition should
help Bull tackle its poor name recognition in this country.
   Another benefit to Bull is that the Zenith acquisition opens up
a wide variety of software to use on a combination of Zenith and
Bull computers, Tasker said. The existing Bull machines can use
only a narrow range of software, while the Zenith machines can run
on a huge number of software packages, he said.
   By linking the Zenith machines with Bull computers, Bull can
sell computer systems compatible with ``huge horizons'' of
programs, he said.
   Also Wednesday, the Zenith division unveiled its first desktop
machine that conforms with an industry standard Zenith helped
establish in 1988.
   The standard, called Extended Industry Standard Architecture,
was proposed by nine computer makers as a competitor to the
microchannel computer architecture developed by International
Business Machines Corp.
   In addition to being based on the new architecture, Zenith says
the new machine offers greatly increased access to its computer
disc, which would be useful in applications where 30 users or more
are hooked up to the computer system.

   The judge who will oversee the bankruptcy
reorganization of Campeau Corp.'s department store empire has a
reputation as a quietly efficient jurist _ but in this mammoth case
he also may want to fall back on his reputation for humor.
   Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr., who has been a U.S. bankruptcy judge
for 14 months, also is an amateur poet who two years ago presented
to the City Council a tongue-in-cheek ode on the merits of a
proposal to include bronze, winged pigs in a sculpture marking
Cincinnati's 1988 bicentennial.
   Critics said the pigs _ a reference to Cincinnati's 19th century
prominence in hog butchering _ made the city look silly.
   Part of Aug's 18-line verse read: ``I've heard a recent nasty
rumor; Cincinnati has no sense of humor; Now the question's grown
so big; Shall we adopt the flying pig?''
   The pigs eventually were retained.
   Aug, 43, faces a more arduous task in guiding the
reorganizations of Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. Six thousand pages articulating the largest
Chapter 11 filing in U.S. retailing history was filed with Aug's
court Monday.
   Riding on the fates of the Cincinnati-based divisions of Campeau
are 100,000 employees and 258 department stores nationwide,
including the locally based, 14,000-employee Lazarus chain.
   Aug, who also has worked as a private attorney and newspaperman
during his career, is no stranger to the federal bench or
bankruptcy cases.
   He was appointed in 1976 to an eight-year term as a U.S.
magistrate in Cincinnati and was reappointed in 1984. Magistrates
handle arraignments and certain cases under supervision of federal
district court judges.
   Aug became one of Cincinnati's two federal bankruptcy judges on
Dec. 1, 1988, when he filled a vacancy created when Judge Randall
J. Newsome transferred to a similar job in San Francisco.
   Aug handled some bankruptcy cases as a Cincinnati lawyer from
1974 to 1976 as an attorney in private practice, and before then
was a staff attorney with the federal courts in Washington. His
father, J. Vincent Aug Sr., is a Cincinnati lawyer.
   Aug declined a request by The Associated Press for an interview
because he did not wish to comment on the Federated-Allied case, an
aide said.
   Martha Perin, executive director of the Cincinnati Bar
Foundation and former director of the Cincinati Bar Association,
described Aug as low-key but efficient.
   ``He's very capable, quiet, very unassuming but very diligent,''
she said.
   Aug was born in Indianapolis and educated in Cincinnati schools.
   After graduating from St. Xavier High School, he went to
Georgetown University, where he received a bachelor's degree in
1968. He served two years with the Peace Corps in Kenya, then was a
newspaper reporter in 1970 for The Cincinnati Post.
   He received his law degree in 1973 from the University of
Cincinnati and took a job that year as a staff attorney with the
Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation in the federal court
system's Washington administrative office.
   Aug served as a columnist for The Cincinnati Enquirer from 1978
to 1983, was an adjunct faculty member at the University of
Cincinnati College of Law from 1982 to 1985, and was president of
the Cincinnati chapter of the Federal Bar Association in 1982.

<TEXT>
   The financial house listed as the biggest
unsecured creditor in bankruptcy filings by Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. says it's owed about half of
what the documents indicate.
   First Boston Corp. issued a statement Wednesday saying that the
filings accurately list Federated's and Allied's combined unsecured
obligations to First Boston Corp. as $526 million.
   But the New York-based firm said other factors limit First
Boston's total exposure to $293 million, including exchange notes
resulting from a temporary loan it made to Federated.
   The filings value securities at face, or par, value, but First
Boston acquired many of those bonds at substantial discounts, the
company said. The filing also includes custodial holdings for the
firm's customers, First Boston said.
   In addition, the filing accounts for zero-coupon bonds at their
full value at maturity, even though the bonds do not mature until
2004 and their value today is significantly less, First Boston said.
   Troubled Campeau Corp. put its Federated and Allied divisions,
which operate 258 department stores, under federal bankruptcy court
protection Monday to allow the companies to operate while they work
out a plan to satisfy creditors.
   The U.S. retail units now operate under the corporate umbrella
Federated Stores Inc. G. William Miller, the former treasury
secretary and Federal Reserve Board chairman named Tuesday as
chairman of Federated, met Wednesday in Cincinnati with the heads
of the Campeau's nine U.S. department store chains.
   The company would not comment on how Federated and Allied would
reorganize and pay their creditors, but retail analysts continued
to speculate that sales of store groups are imminent.
   ``I think they'll be selling off some assets. They have some
great names there and some wonderful stores they could sell,'' said
Karen Sack, an analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in New York.
``There are a lot of other retail chains around that would like to
pick up the retail chains they have.''
   Federated's stores are Abraham and Straus and Bloomingdale's of
New York, Lazarus of Cincinnati, Burdine's of Miami and Rich's of
Atlanta. Allied's stores are The Bon Marche of Seattle, Jordan
Marsh of Boston, Maas Brothers of Tampa and Stern's of Paramus, N.J.
   In their Chapter 11 filing the companies listed assets of $9.1
billion and liabilities of $7.7 billion, much of it debt used to
finance Toronto-based Campeau's purchases of Allied in 1986 and
Federated in 1988.
   ``The debt must be significantly reduced. That was the cause of
the problem, and that is the only cure,'' said Monroe Greenstein of
Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. ``The operating company is basically a good
sound company, until this huge overhang of debt hit it.''
   James M. Zimmerman, president of Federated and Allied, has said
that executives want to resist selling divisions of the company to
pay creditors. The only exception is Federated's 17-store
Bloomingdale's chain, which it put up for sale last year.
   The chains, whose operations had been profitable before the
Chapter 11 filing, should be able to operate normally now that they
are temporarily relieved of their debt burden, said Jack Seibald of
Salomon Brothers Inc.
   ``The thing that got to them was not the operations, it was the
debt,'' Seibald said.
   Joseph Chervin, a New York bankruptcy lawyer who is representing
some of Federated's and Allied's creditors, said those at greatest
risk during the bankruptcy court proceedings are investors who
bought bonds Campeau sold to finance its venture into American
retailing.
   ``Everybody's getting paid except the bond holders,'' Chervin
said. ``The banks that put money in (after Monday's filing) are
getting taken care of, the suppliers are getting taken care of.''
   Creditors from before the filing will have a chance to vote on
acceptance of the retailers' reorganization plan, which must be
approved by the federal bankruptcy court, said Neal Colton, a
Philadelphia bankruptcy lawyer.
   Colton said bond holders could be asked to accept reduced
interest payments or longer repayment periods.
   ``The difference in a reorganization of this magnitude is that
it is unclear whether there will be enough money to pay off
everyone who holds debts,'' Colton said.
   Documents Campeau filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission earlier this month warned that even the sale of all its
store groups might not raise enough money under certain conditions
to pay off all the debts.

   The aura of invincibility that AT&amp;T managed
to create with heavy advertising and dependable service has
unraveled a bit with Monday's network outage, but the company will
not be abandoned by its customers, analysts say.
   A more likely result will be a hard-sell by American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.'s competitors to get companies to add a backup
carrier to their service.
   ``They can now go to large customers and say, `See, this is what
can happen. You need us as a backup,''' said Audrey Stevoff, an
analyst with the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
   ``AT&amp;T is up there with motherhood and apple pie and
perfection,'' Ms. Stevoff said Wednesday. ``It shook everybody up,
including the company. It really did tarnish their image. It showed
that they reallyaren't perfect.''
   No. 2 MCI Communications Corp. and No. 3 US Sprint wasted no
time in capitalizing on AT&amp;T's embarrassing misfortune.
   ``This is a competitive business and beating up on the
competition is the name of the game,'' said Geoffrey Johnson, a
telecommunications analyst at Argus Research Corp. in New York.
``MCI and Sprint were both just handed a giant club.''
   Sprint came out swinging.
   Sprint, which controls about 8 percent of the long-distance
market, placed a full-page ad in several newspapers Wednesday
informing customers how to access its service if they have problems
with other carriers: dial 10333, then 1, the area code and the
number.
   The procedure is the same for MCI except the access code is
10222.
   ``We don't want to rub salt in anybody's wounds,'' said Sprint
spokesman Sid Courson. But, he added: ``AT&amp;T has been heralding its
system and its history of utter reliablity and it just ain't so.
   ``We have never lost the whole network,'' he said. ``They did.''
   AT&amp;T, which has 70 percent of the long-distance market, was
planning to offer a day of reduced-rate calling or another customer
benefit to help atone for the inconvenience Monday, when half its
calls didn't go through, said spokesman Harry Baumgartner. The plan
could be announced today, the company said.
   It was possible AT&amp;T would ask its competitors to agree to
temporarily transfer customers to each other should any of them run
into similar problems, Baumgartner said.
   On Monday, AT&amp;T operators at first refused to provide access
codes for customers to reach MCI or Sprint. The policy was
abandoned when the seriousnes of AT&amp;T's problem became apparent,
the company said.
   Baumgartner said: ``We have focused on quality like no other.
That's why this is so painful for AT&amp;T.''
   He said the computer software glitch that knocked out service
was an aberration and most of the company's customers will
understand that and not jump to other carriers.
   Courson said Sprint's Dallas office, which concentrates on
medium and large businesses, averaged 20 unsolicited calls an hour
Tuesday and Wednesday from companies asking about the service. He
said that prior to Monday's outage, the company averaged about 11
unsolicited calls per day.
   Many large corporations already have backup carriers, but many
others do not, probably because they never experienced such
problems with AT&amp;T and did not expect to, Ms. Stevoff said.
   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Sue Fleming said virtually all of the company's
large business customers have the capability of adding a backup
service with little expense. But adding a backup carrier usually
reduces the number of lines for the primary carrier, she said.
   Figures on the percentage of AT&amp;T customers that also use a
second carrier were not available from AT&amp;T, MCI or Sprint.
   The inconvenience of this week's problems may push those with a
single carrier _ regardless of which company it is _ to sign up a
second carrier.
   John Hauser, an MCI spokesman, said his company's strategy was
similar to Sprint's.
   ``We're not going to have to do anything more than we have been
doing,'' he said. ``We just have to announce louder that we're
around and that businesses probably shouldn't put all their eggs in
one basket.''
   A spokesman for Du Pont Co., one of AT&amp;T's largest customers,
said AT&amp;T's failure affected all of his company's communications
because none of its long-distance traffic moves on private,
dedicated lines.
   The spokesman, John Wheeler, said Du Pont is constantly
evaluating its communications system because the network is vital
to its business. Du Pont does about 40 percent of its business
overseas.
   ``Let's just say there was a very long pause in our business
day,'' he said. ``But I've heard no suggestions here that Du Pont
is either backing up or getting rid of AT&amp;T.''

<HEAD>British Airways Chief Calls for Global Task Force on Airline
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief executive of British Airways PLC has
called for the creation of a special international task force to
help solve the airline industry's lack of capacity worldwide.
   Colin Marshall, chief executive and joint deputy chairman of the
British airline, said Wednesday an ``action group'' should be set
up under the International Air Transport Association to deal with
crowded airports, runways and air traffic corridors.
   ``What we need is an action group under the aegis of IATA, one
which can approach the problems bluntly and directly, operating
from a basis of self-interest and at the same time of overall
industry concern,'' Marshall said in a speech to the Wings Club, an
aviation industry group.
   ``If we cannot create something like this, then I suspect the
constantly growing `airweed,' a cousin to that which can eventually
stop even the largest oceangoing ships, will bring us to a moribund
halt,'' he said.
   Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles said he agrees with
Marshall about the capacity problems but isn't sure an
international task force is the solution.
   ``It's an interesting idea but I don't know how necessary it
is,'' he said in an interview following the speech.
   Nobles is a member of the Partnership for Improved Air Travel, a
U.S. lobbying group seeking to have money in the Airport and Airway
Trust Fund earmarked for system improvement. Because of pressure to
reduce the federal budget deficit, neither the White House nor
Congress has been willing to dip into the aviation trust fund,
which is supplied by an 8 percent tax that is included in air fares.
   The Air Transport Association, a U.S. industry group in
Washington, D.C., also said it found Marshall's proposal
interesting.
   ``The U.S. airlines would certainly be willing to consider any
measure that would have a realistic prospect of improving the
world's airports-airways capacity problem,'' said ATA spokeswoman
Kathleen Rosenauer. She declined to elaborate.
   In his speech, Marshall suggested that six or seven ``capable''
senior airline executives should get together with IATA to
determine how to set up an international task force.
   ``British Airways would be willing to offer the services of one
of its best managers,'' he said, adding that ``we ... should not
have any greater part in it than anyone else.''
   Asked whether he was offering himself as a potential
participant, Marshall replied, ``I'm not accustomed to hiding my
light under the bushes, so why not?''

   All Christine M. Weakley wants to do as head of
Paces Bank &amp; Trust is run a successful business.
   But as one of the few female chief executive officers of a bank,
she finds herself in the position of having to knock down
misconceptions that Paces is a ``women's'' bank.
   Though the majority of the bank's stockholders, directors and
senior managers are women, ``our interest first and foremost is to
be a good bank,'' Ms. Weakley said.
   Stressing highly personalized service, Paces caters mainly to
small businesses. The Atlanta bank opened last month and had, as of
Dec. 31, $1.5 million in deposits and $500,000 in loans.
   Because of the attention she has received as CEO and president,
several misconceptions have arisen about the bank, Ms. Weakley said.
   ``There are always various and sundry comments, that we're all
feminists out to right the wrongs of the world, that we only bank
with women. We've even been called a pro-choice bank,'' Ms. Weakley
said.
   ``One man who came in was real uncomfortable and said he had to
talk to a man,'' Ms. Weakley recalled during an interview at her
office Wednesday. ``He said, `No offense, but women in banking to
me is like men selling Avon.'''
   Ms. Weakley is no newcomer to banking. She worked for nine years
at the First National Bank of Cobb County before deciding to open
her own bank.
   The preponderance of women in the organization helped Paces
qualify for the federal government's minority banks program. The
program helps open the door to accounts for such banks by making
them eligible for deposits from government agencies and certain
corporations.
   ``The government still considers women a minority,'' Ms. Weakley
said. ``I've never been a rabid feminist and don't plan to be. I
simply saw it (the program) as a way to get started quicker.''
   The minority status has been a mixed blessing for Paces and Ms.
Weakley. It has helped the bank get a foothold in the competitive
Atlanta market, but also has given it a label that makes some
potential customers wary.
   ``Unfortunately, it has been turned around that we're
automatically making a social statement,'' Ms. Weakley said. ``When
the publicity first started, that was the angle the media used _ a
women's bank opens in Atlanta.''
   Ms. Weakley's experiences with people uneasy about her position
are not uncommon among women in high-ranking executive jobs, said
Patricia McDougall, an associate professor of management at Georgia
State University who specializes in issues involving women.
   ``It's very common for female executives to face the problem of
being stereotyped and their sex being reacted to rather than their
expertise,'' Ms. McDougall said.
   She said the problems occur especially at the higher levels of
the corporate world because women in middle management positions
now are not considered unusual.
   Ms. McDougall said negative reactions have accompanied most
instances where women have done things that previously were taboo.
   ``It goes back to when the first female walked out and filled
your car with gas. It was a shock,'' she said. ``Now we think
nothing of seeing women stand at self-service pumps.''
   Ms. Weakley said she and her bank have been accepted by those in
the banking business, but the misconceptions remain largely among
the public, which she said is not accustomed to seeing women run
banks.
   Indeed, Ms. Weakley said that in most cases when she has been
given the chance to talk to a wary potential customer, she has
overcome their hesitance.
   ``A lot of people, if they sit down long enough to talk to you,
they get over a lot of the preconceptions,'' she said.
   A Treasury Department roster of banks qualifying under the
federal minority program lists 98 institutions across the country,
but does not distinguish between those that qualified because they
are run by ethnic minorities and those run by women.
   A Treasury official in Washington, who asked not to be
identified, said most of the banks in the program are run by ethnic
minorities.
   ``The fact of the matter is there were more women banks in the
country and more in our program. But for whatever reason, many of
them folded. It seemed to be an idea whose time hadn't come,'' the
official said.

<HEAD>Conrail Announces $1.3 Billion Buyback of Stock In Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail's restructuring plan met with praise
from a railroad analyst who said the $1 billion stock repurchase
and $300 million employee stock plan will help ward off any
takeover attempts.
   ``They probably couldn't come up with a better plan,'' said
analyst Anthony B. Hatch of PaineWebber Inc. ``This is a prudent
way to help them in the short- and long-term.''
   Officials of Consolidated Rail Corp. said Wednesday they would
launch today a $1 billion tender offer for up to 21 million of the
railroad's 67.1 million common shares, with the price range for the
``Dutch auction'' at $43 to $53 per share.
   Conrail's shares closed Wednesday at $46.12{ in New York Stock
Exchange trading, down 37{ cents. The restructuring was announced
after the market closed.
   Although company officials would not comment on their motive,
analysts noted that Conrail, the nation's fifth-largest railroad in
terms of revenue, loses its government protection against takeovers
April 2.
   Hatch speculated the restructuring was a move to head off any
takeover attempts by ensuring that its stock was fairly valued.
   Conrail could attract a corporate raider because of the
railroad's small long-term debt and cash reserves of about $600
million, analysts said. They say Conrail could be worth more broken
up and sold off than the cost of all its stock.
   Conrail's move was made possible in part by recent legislation
that allows the freight railroad to buy back significant amounts of
its own stock.
   The Philadelphia-based company, created by federal legislation
to rescue the Penn Central and five other bankrupt railroads in
1976, was sold by the government to the public in 1987. However,
the government retained some power over the company, such as
limiting its repurchase of stock.
   Also Wednesday, Conrail, which operates in 14 Northeastern and
Midwestern states and Quebec, reported 1989 earnings of $148
million, or $2.17 per share, down from $306 million, or $4.44 per
share, in 1988.
   The 1989 earnings reflected a special charge of $234 million, or
$2.16 per share, related to layoffs, consolidation of operating and
administrative functions and a larger reserve fund for expenses
related to accidents.
   The special charge was taken in the fourth quarter, which showed
a loss of $81 million, or $1.20 per share, compared with earnings
of $78 million, or $1.13 per share, for the same quarter in 1988.
   Hagen said the company's board of directors undertook the
restructuring ``to improve performance and structure and thereby
enhance shareholder value.''
   Under the repurchase plan, which expires Feb. 14, the company
will conduct a Dutch auction, meaning stock owners will offer their
shares to the company for a price that falls within the range
Conrail specified. The company, in turn, will select a share price
within the range that will enable it to buy the number of shares it
set out to buy.
   As part of its repurchase plan, Conrail said it will spend $200
million to $400 million to buy additional shares on the open market
after the Dutch auction is completed. The amount of the repurchase
will depend in part of the results of the Dutch auction, it said.
   Conrail spokesman Saul Resnick said the railroad established the
$300 million employee stock ownership plan for non-union employees
but is still considering a similar plan for union employees.
   For the fourth quarter, Conrail's revenue totaled $823 million,
compared with $904 million in the same quarter of 1988. Revenue for
all of 1989 was $3.41 billion, compared with $3.49 billion in 1988.
   Hagen said fourth quarter revenue was affected by a 4.7 percent
drop in traffic volume, with the largest declines in metals and
related product shipments, down 23.6 percent, and in automotive
shipments, down 15.2 percent.
   He predicted a further downturn in traffic in 1990, due to
projected declines in auto and steel shipments.
   Meanwhile, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a credit-rating agency,
lowered its rating of Conrail's debt in response to the
restructuring, which it said would weaken the company's credit
standing somewhat.
   S&amp;P lowered its rating of Conrail senior debt to A from AA- and
its equipment trust certificates to AA from AAA, its highest rating.

   Britain's unemployment rate fell to 5.8 percent in
December, its lowest level in more than nine years, the government
said Thursday.
   The seasonally adjusted rate compared with a revised rate of 5.9
percent in November, and a rate of 7.2 percent a year ago, the
Department of Employment said.
   The number of jobless fell by 17,100 in the latest month,
compared with declines of 22,900 in November and 67,800 a year
earlier.
   Without seasonal adjustment, the number of unemployed was 1.64
million in December, compared with 1.61 million in November and
2.05 million in December 1988.
   Employment Secretary Michael Howard said unemployment is now at
the lowest rate since October 1980.

   The 1986 Chevrolet Camaro topped a list of the
nation's most-stolen vehicles, thanks in part to the
interchangeability of its parts with other General Motors Corp.
cars, an insurance valuation company said.
   A list compiled by CCC Information Services Inc. of Chicago
showed the 1986 Camaro again in first. It was followed by the 1987,
'84 and '85 models of the Camaro. Camaros also held the top four
spots on the most-stolen list for 1988.
   The 1988 Hyundai Excel GL, at No. 10, was the only car not made
by GM in the top 10.
   Car thieves, for the most part, are parts suppliers, CCC Vice
President William Geen said Wednesday. And interchangeability of
parts, such as between the Firebird and Camaro, makes those cars
more likely candidates for theft.
   ``If the belief is that the No. 1 reason that people steal cars
is for the parts, it would seem to be common sense that they would
always appear on top,'' Geen said.
   The 1988 Ford Mustang, No. 43 among stolen cars, was the first
non-GM, domestic car on the list compiled by CCC and used by the
insurance industry to provide theft data.
   GM is banking that in later reports, newer Camaros will drop in
rankings.
   ``We're confident that our new `PASS-Key' system will greatly
reduce the number of thefts,'' said GM spokeswoman Ruth Bouldes.
   The system, which shuts down the fuel system if someone tampers
with the ignition system, originally was introduced on the 1986
Corvette and the 1989 Camaro.
   The annual report also reflected the growing popularity of light
trucks, especially pickups, not only among buyers but among thieves.
   The 1986 and 1985 Chevrolet full-size pickup trucks zoomed to
13th and 14th places, respectively, on last year's list. Neither
vehicle was in the top 100 in 1988.
   ``The number of light duty trucks sold in the last two to three
years is just off the charts,'' Geen said.
   Sales of domestic and foreign light trucks jumped to 4.7 million
in 1989, up 9.3 percent from the 1985 level.
   The increased popularity, he said, increases the likelihood of
them becoming theft targets for parts suppliers.

   U.S. airlines had their most fatal air crashes
last year since 1968 but the government says the overall accident
rate for commercial air carriers and commuters declined.
   In all, 278 people were killed in 11 crashes in 1989 involving
scheduled and non-scheduled air carriers, down slightly from the
285 in 1988, the National Transportation Safety Board said
Wednesday.
   The most deadly year of the decade was 1985 when 526 people were
killed in seven fatal commercial aviation accidents. The least
destructive year was 1980 when only one fatal accident took place,
killing just one person.
   Also last year, 763 people died in accidents involving private
or general aircraft, the safety board said, the lowest figure for
that category since it began keeping statistics. There were 781
deaths involving general aviation accidents in 1988.
   The board said the fatal accident rate for general or private
aviation continued ``an improving trend that lasted most of the
decade.''
   Despite the high number of airline accidents involving
fatalities last year, the overall accident rate for commercial air
carriers and commuters declined, the safety board said.
   There were 28 accidents involving U.S. scheduled and charter
airlines last year, a decrease from the 32 accidents recorded in
1988. The 11 involving fatalities were the most since the 15 of
1968.
   The fatal accident rate was 0.144 for every 100,000 scheduled
and charter departures, up from 0.026 in 1988.
   The major scheduled U.S. airlines had 24 accidents last year,
down from 31 the previous year. Of those two dozen accidents, eight
involved fatalities, the most since 1973.
   Accidents involving scheduled airlines took 131 lives last year,
111 of them when a United Airlines DC-10 crashed in Sioux City,
Iowa on July 19. The safety board noted a passenger who died 31
days after the accident was not registered in its statistics.
   The scheduled-airline accident rate for each 100,000 departures
was 0.328, down from 0.412 in 1988. The fatal accident rate rose
from 0.027 to 0.109.
   Charter airlines experienced four accidents during the year,
three of them involving fatalities. A total of 147 people died, all
but three of them in the Feb. 8 crash of an Independent Air B-707.
   There were no fatal accidents involving chartered aircraft in
1988.
   Here are other aviation accident statistics for 1989:
   _Commuter flights: There were 18 accidents, one fewer then in
1988. Five fatal accidents, up from 2 in 1988, took 31 lives. That
was 10 more than in 1988. The accident rate: 0.621 for each 100,000
departures compared to a rate of 0.654 in 1988. The fatal accident
rate rose from 0.069 to 0.172.
   _Air taxis: Accidents rose from 98 in 1988 to 110. The number of
fatal accidents declined from 27 to 23. But fatalities increased
from 58 to 80. The accident rate rose from 3.45 to 3.83 for every
100,000 aircraft hours. But the fatal accident rate dropped from
0.95 to 0.80.
   _General aviation: The accident rate dropped for the seventh
year in a row from 7.97 for each 100,000 aircraft hours in 1988 to
7.25. The last increase in the accident rate took place in 1982
when it was 10,06. The fatal accident rate declined to 1.40 for
each 100,000 hours from 1.52 in 1988.

   The federal government should close the 14
percent pay gap between Hispanic employees and other civil servants
to improve its ``disturbing'' Hispanic employment rate, according
to an advocacy group.
   The average salary for Hispanic white collar civil servants in
1988 was $3,918 less than for the their counterparts, according to
a report released Wednesday by the National Association of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials.
   The pay gap damages the government's efforts to hire Hispanics,
said Harry Pachon, the group's national director.
   Richard McGowan, a spokesman for the Office of Personnel
Management, said several factors affect white collar workers'
salaries, including experience, education and seniority.
   Hispanics made up 5.2 percent of executive branch employees and
accounted for 7.3 percent of the private sector workforce in 1988,
the most recent year for which the information was available,
according to the study.
   ``It's a disturbing thing, because if anybody should be
exhibiting fair employment practices that represent the ethnic
makeup of the country, it should be the federal government,'' said
Robert Paral, a researcher for the association.
   Only one of 13 federal agencies _ the Justice Department with a
9.3 percent Hispanic employment rate _ exceeded the private sector
average, said the report, which reviewed 1988 affirmative action
information.
   Of 1,227 civil servants working at executive office agencies
such as the Office of Management and Budget, only 13, or 1.1
percent, are Hispanic, the report said.
   ``The lack of Hispanics in those jobs is especially bothersome
because these are the people who have the president's ear,'' Paral
said.
   In a speech last month to Hispanics, OPM Director Constance
Newman acknowledged that Hispanics remain under-represented in the
government's 2.1 million civilian workforce. She said the
government has programs to recruit Hispanics.
   The report showed five of the agencies have Hispanic employment
rates of less than half the national average. For instance,
Hispanics make up 3.2 percent of the Department of Education's
workforce.
   The government's hiring rate for Hispanics has steadily
increased over the past 15 years, growing from 3.7 percent in 1976
to 5.3 percent as of March 1989, McGowan said. The number should
increase as minorities and women make up a larger portion of the
workforce, he said.
   Hispanics account for about 9 percent of the nation's
population, Paral said. Since 1980, the number of adult Hispanics
who are citizens and therefore eligible for federal government jobs
has increased by more than 45 percent, he said.

<HEAD>Plans Fall Through For Heiress to Buy Shipyard, But New Plan In
Works</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Plans for a Polish-born heiress to buy the
shipyard where Solidarity was born fell through this month after
her representatives demanded a five-year strike ban and wages of 50
cents an hour.
   A newspaper says a portrait of Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, the New
Jersey heiress who last year offered to invest up to $100 million
in the shipyard, has now been replaced at the complex by one of
Polish-born Pope John Paul II.
   Ms. Johnson had been hailed as a savior for offering the cash to
keep the Lenin Shipyard afloat. Now, officials say they're drawing
up a plan to sell shares in the yard to workers and investors alike.
   The shipyard's future has been uncertain since October 1988,
when Poland's government _ then run by Communists _ announced plans
to close the sprawling facility in the spirit of economic reform.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who took charge of the
independent movement that transformed the Communist bloc during a
1980 strike at the shipyard, called the government move a
provocation.
   The Communist authorities said the shipyard was unprofitable,
and closing it was just the sort of hardship workers would have to
endure if Poland's economic slide was to be reversed.
   Mrs. Johnson, who married the head of the Johnson and Johnson
pharmaceutical firm and inherited his fortune, signed a letter of
intent to take a controlling interest in the shipyard. During
visits to Poland from her New Jersey home, she appeared frequently
smiling and joking at Walesa's side.
   But terms were never reached and the letter of intent expired
Jan. 1, although Mrs. Johnson offered to continue the talks.
   James Whisenand, a Miami attorney who represents Mrs. Johnson,
was not immediately available for comment Wednesday.
   Zbigniew Lis, who negotiated for the Solidarity local during
talks with the government on the yard's future, told the Communist
Youth daily Sztandar Mlodych that Mrs. Johnson's conditions made it
difficult for the workers to accept what she proposed.
   He said her business representatives wanted a five-year ban on
strikes and a 50-cent hourly wage for the same period. Other joint
ventures pay double that amount, he said.
   A new proposal to save the shipyard has been put forth by the
Solidarity-led government. It would allow the yard to reorganize as
a joint stock company, with workers being allowed to buy shares.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska told a Jan. 5
news conference that foreigners, including Mrs. Johnson, would be
allowed to buy into the joint stock company.
   There have been no indications if Mrs. Johnson intends to
participate.
   However, before the actual transformation of the shipyard into a
joint stock company, Parliament must pass legislation on
privatization of government-owned industries. That is expected to
take six months, the newspaper said.
   Meanwhile, counting on Mrs. Johnson's offer, the shipyard may
have passed up other potential offers from various foreign
investors, Sztandar Mlodych reported Jan. 8.
   The newspaper said that workers had taken down a portrait of
Mrs. Johnson, replacing it with one of the pope in the showcase at
the main Gate 2 entrance to the shipyard.

<HEAD>Southmark Offers Reorganization Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp., once a high-flying real estate
company built with junk bonds, would be left with only a weak Texas
thrift controlled by creditors under a reorganization plan filed
with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   The plan filed Wednesday envisions selling off all Southmark
assets except San Jacinto Savings and Loan, paying off most secured
creditors and giving junk bond holders pennies on the dollar.
   When Southmark filed for protection from its creditors in July,
it had assets of $9.1 billion. Since then, losses, revaluations and
asset sales have left it with $5 billion, most of which is tied up
in San Jacinto, Texas's ninth largest thrift.
   Officials said San Jacinto, based in Bellaire, is losing an
average of $10 million a month.
   Under the plan, which must be approved by creditors and the
bankruptcy court, Southmark would inject $100 million into San
Jacinto, bringing it into compliance with some, but not all,
government regulations.
   All other assets _ insurance, oil and nursing home companies,
interest in casinos in Atlantic City and San Juan, numerous real
estate partnerships _ would be sold.
   Southmark acquired the assets mainly through financing provided
by high-risk, high-yield junk bonds sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   The high-cost debt, together with the collapse of the Southwest
real estate market, led to Southmark's demise, said William G.
Forster, a managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. who has
advised Southmark since it filed for bankruptcy.
   Southmark Chairman Arthur G. Weiss, hired a year ago, said the
speedy liquidation was the only way to leave even a small amount of
money for creditors, who also will retain ownership in a
reorganized Southmark under a new management and board of directors
they will select.
   ``The object was to take the assets that are here and to
preserve the pie,'' Weiss told reporters Wednesday. He estimated
the bankruptcy was costing Southmark and the creditors about $3
million a month in legal and administrative fees.
   In addition, federal claims against San Jacinto, estimated to be
potentially $2 billion, would have wiped out any assets otherwise
available to debtholders, he said.
   ``We've got slices of the pie that have to be divided up,''
Forster said. ``But the basic theory is that if we don't pull the
pie out of the oven, it will burn to a crisp.''
   Under the plan, holders of about $600 million in Southmark junk
bonds would get the first $200 million from sales of assets.
Anything above that would go to other debtholders, but Forster
estimated that they would receive less than 10 cents for every
dollar owed.
   Southmark officials admit creditors may initially balk because
of the low payback, but Weiss said, ``We think that we have put
forward a plan that ought to be appealing,'' and ``at the end of
the day,'' creditors will vote to go along.
   The plan envisions emerging from bankruptcy by mid-1994 and
foresees San Jacinto as a much smaller thrift engaged in more
traditional savings and loan businesses.

   Housing starts, slowed by record cold weather
over much of the nation last month, declined 8 percent in December
and ended the year at the lowest level since the recession year of
1982, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the December decline helped slow
construction of new homes and apartments to 1.37 million units in
1989, compared to 1.49 million units the previous year, a 7.6
percent drop.
   The 1.37 million starts last year were the lowest since 1982
when 1.06 million units were built. Both the Federal National
Mortgage Association and the National Association of Home Builders
are forecasting about 1.37 million starts in 1990.
   Before the abnormally cold weather hit last month, the housing
industry had been held back through much of this year by high
interest rates, which have moderated recently.
   Starts dropped from a high of 1.68 million units last January to
1.26 million units in September before rebounding to 1.43 million
units in October. Starts fell again in November, to 1.34 million
units, pulled down by a 15.3 percent decline in multi-family
projects.
   According to a survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.,
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.78 percent at the end of December
after peaking over 11 percent last March.
   The department said new homes and apartments were built at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million units in December,
down from a revised 1.34 million units in November.
   Construction of single-family homes in December fell 10 percent
to an annual rate of 904,000 units after falling 2 percent in
November. That was the lowest since 862,000 units were started in
December 1982.
   Apartment construction declined 2.4 percent to an annual rate of
331,000 units, compared to a 15.3 percent decline in November.
   The Northeast posted the steepest decline, down 23.3 percent to
138,000 units. That was followed by a 10 percent drop in the South
to 439,000 units and a 9.8 percent decline in the Midwest to
268,000 units.
   Starts rose only in the West, where they gained 3.4 percent to
39,000.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, bore potentially bad news for the New Year. They were
down 0.4 percent from the previous month.
   During all of 1989, 1.34 million permits were issued, the lowest
amount since 1 million in 1982.

   The stock market declined broadly today,
extending its early-1990 slide amid uneasiness over weak corporate
earnings and rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.37 points to
2,646.76 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 194 up, 862
down and 388 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.82 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market was unsettled by a series of adverse
corporate earnings reports over the past couple of days.
   The latest came this morning when Digital Equipment posted
earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 30 of $1.25 a share,
against $2.20 a share in the like period a year earlier.
   Digital's shares tumbled 5&rsqb; to 82{ after a delayed opening.
   Selling continued, meanwhile in Aluminum Co. of America, down ~
at 66, and International Business Machines, down } at 98&lsqb;, after
the two companies reported lower quarterly profits on Wednesday.
   At the same time, brokers said fears of a developing recession
were intensified by recent upward pressure on interest rates in
this country and in other leading industrialized countries.
   Rising rates in Japan, Germany and England are seen as a
deterrant to any move soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its
credit policy.
   Fed policymakers are believed to be concerned that lower rates
in the United States would prompt a flow of money out of American
credit markets into foreign securities with increasingly attractive
yields.
   That perception has helped push U.S. interest rates higher in
the past several days.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.09 to 185.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.96 at 366.10.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 33.49 to
2,659.13, its lowest close since it stood at 2,656.78 on Nov. 22.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 633 up, 867 down and 464 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 170.47 million shares, against 186.07
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The New York Times today published information
from secret Ernst &amp; Young documents detailing partner profits at
the accounting giant, which won a court order preventing their
publication in a newsletter last week.
   The Times said the material showed partners at Ernst &amp; Whinney
will take home roughly 65 percent of all profits they earn jointly
with Arthur Young for the next three years, while Arthur Young's
partners will share the rest.
   The firms merged last year, creating one of the largest
accounting agencies in the world. The merged company has sought to
squelch the release of the secret information, contending it was an
invasion of privacy.
   The Times account said the confidential documents showed Ernst &amp;
Whinney was by far the stronger of the two firms and its partners
historically out-earned their peers at Arthur Young.
   Senior Ernst &amp; Young officials did not return telephone calls to
The Associated Press this morning for comment on the Times story. A
secretary at the company's New York headquarters said they were in
a meeting.
   The Times didn't explain how it got a copy of the documents,
which also were leaked to Bowman's Accounting Report and Accounting
Today, two trade publications. Ernst &amp; Young won a court order Jan.
8 stopping publication of the documents by Bowman's and has asked
Accounting Today to return them.
   A hearing on the court order against Bowman's by New York
Supreme Court Judge Beatrice Shainswit was scheduled for this
morning.
   Editor Robert Crane of Accounting Today, a twice-monthly
newsletter based in New York, said Wednesday that it planned to
publish the material in its Feb. 5 edition, mailed to subscribers
Jan. 30.
   Crane said he did not believe the content to be very significant
outside of the accounting profession. Crane said he believed Ernst
&amp; Young was reacting more to what it felt was a violation of its
internal affairs.
   ``You have to keep in mind that accountants take confidentiality
very seriously,'' Crane said. ``In this instance, one of their own
leaked proprietary information.''
   The court order won by Ernst &amp; Toung has attracted enormous
attention from news organizations, which claim it violated the
constitutional guarantee of press freedom.
   The Associated Press, New York Times, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Wall Street Journal and other media groups
have joined Bowman's in charging that the order was
unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
   Nisshin Steel Co. Chairman Yuzuru Abe, who led
Japanese steelmakers in investing in the United States, has died,
the company said Thursday. He was 73.
   Nisshin said Abe died Sunday at his home in Tokyo of liver
disease.
   Abe, a native of Tokushima in southwestern Japan, joined Nihon
Seitetsu, then Japan's leading steelmaker, in 1938 after graduating
from Tokyo University.
   In 1970, he became an executive director of Nippon Steel Corp.,
which became the nation's largest steelmaker when it was formed in
a merger between Yahata Seitetsu and Fuji Seitesu.
   Abe became an executive vice president of Nippon Steel in 1977.
He moved to Nisshin Steel in 1980 as president and had been
chairman of the company since 1985.
   Under Abe's leadership, Nisshin Steel became the first of
Japan's leading steelmakers to enter a joint venture in the United
States.
   In 1984, Nisshin joined with Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp.,
the eighth-largest U.S. steelmaker, to produce and sell aluminum
and galvanized steel sheets in the United States.
   The Japanese government decorated Abe with the Order of the
Rising Sun for his contribution to the development of the nation's
steel industry.

<HEAD>Digital Quarterly Earnings Decline 44 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., citing a slow U.S.
computer market, Thursday reported a 44 percent drop in second
quarter earnings, but the company said investments in new
technology should help boost future sales.
   Digital, the world's second-largest computer company, said
earnings totaled $155.4 million, or $1.25 per share, for the fiscal
quarter that Dec. 30. That compared with earnings of $279.6
million, or $2.20 per share, for the year-ago period.
   Operating revenues for the second quarter were relatively flat
at $3.18 billion, less than a 1 percent increase from the second
quarter of the previous fiscal year.
   ``Depressed earnings come as no surprise,'' said Terry Shannon,
an analyst with Framingham, Mass.-based International Data Corp.,
computer market researcher. But while he said the magnitude of the
drop was surprising, Digital should rebound in the next 12 months
once customers become more acquainted with products the company has
introduced within the last year.
   Digital's announcement followed similar news Wednesday by
industry leader International Business Machines Corp., which
reported a 75 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings and 35
percent drop the year.
   ``It appears that the overall market for computers in Europe and
Japan is good, but in the U.S. the market is still slow,'' Kenneth
Olsen, president of Maynard-based Digital, said in a statement.
   ``Uncertain economic conditions are affecting customer
purchasing intentions and slowing down the computer industry,'' he
said. ``Consequently, we expect continued pressure on operating
results.''
   Digital, plagued by slumping sales, saw earnings decline 22
percent for the fiscal year ended July 1, 1989. The company last
year froze salaries and transferred hundreds of employees from
manufacturing to sales jobs.
   Olsen said Digital has invested heavily in products that will
allow customers to work on a variety of computers.
   ``This means major investments, and in the first six months of
this fiscal year alone we have invested $796 million on research
and development,'' he said. ``But it is, we believe, the cost of
success in this industry.''
   For the six-month period, Digital reported net income of $306.2
million, or $2.44 a share, down 39 percent from $502.9 million, or
$3.90 a share in the year-ago period. Operating revenues were $6.3
billion, up 3 percent from $6.1 billion the previous year.

<TEXT>
   The White House, breaking with its usual
no-comment stance on activities of the Federal Reserve Board, said
today that ``lower interest rates are justified.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said recent economic
reports show that the economy could benefit from an easier monetary
policy.
   ``We had a recent drop in the prime (rate). That hasn't been
totally passed through. But we nevertheless remain hopeful that it
will be,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Major banks lowered the prime interest rate on Jan. 8 to 10
percent, down from 10.5 percent. The independent Federal Reserve,
however, has not lowered its bellwether discount rate, the rate it
charges to other banks, for nearly a year. It stands at 7 percent.
   Asked whether sending a message to the central bank from the
White House briefing room ran counter to the administration's
general policy of not commenting on matters before the Fed,
Fitzwater said:
   ``This is not a new message. But it's important occasionally to
point out that lower interest rates are normally good for the
economy.''
   Fitzwater, in particular, said today's report by the Commerce
Department that housing starts fell by 8 percent in December was
``not good news'' and was ``well below market expectations.''
   ``Housing starts are more responsive to interest rate than
anything else,'' he said.
   He said that, when Bush addresses the National Association of
Homebuilders in Atlanta on Friday, he will tell his audience that
``interest rates are going down.''
   Fitzwater was asked about a story in today's edition of The Wall
Street Journal quoting two Fed members, Vice Chairman Manuel
Johnson and Wayne Angell, as indicating that lower interest rates
were not likely in the near future.
   ``We're hopeful that they will take a look at this morning's
indicators and understand that these numbers are low and indicate
that inflation has remained very steady over the last seven or
eight years and that lower interest rates are justified,'' the
spokesman said.
   In addition to the weak housing starts report, Fitzwater cited
the Labor Department report that showed inflation had grown a
moderate 0.4 percent in December, and had increased by 4.6 percent
for all of 1989, the highest annual increase since 1981.
   Asked whether Bush had spoken to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan recently on the subject of interest rates, Fitzwater
said: ``They speak so often, I'm not sure that's relevant.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. said Thursday its
second-quarter earnings tumbled 54 percent because of the
continuing turbulence on Wall Street.
   The investment firm said it earned $29.1 million, or 29 cents a
share, down from $63.3 million, or 63 cents a share, in the same
period a year earlier.
   Bear Stearns reported second-quarter revenue of $578 million,
down 9 percent from $632.6 million.
   The company attributed the downturn to unfavorable conditions in
the financial markets, including a lack of risk arbitrage
opportunities and a drop in mergers and acquisitions.
   The last three months of 1989 saw heightened uncertainty among
investors and volatility in the financial markets _ including Wall
Street's plunge on Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrial average
fell 190 points.
   Bear Stearns said the results also reflected an increase in its
common stock dividend.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, Bear Stearns said it
earned $51.2 million, or 51 cents per share, down 39 percent from
$83.8 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue totaled $1.16 billion, up 5 percent from
$1.11 billion the previous year.

   Hobbyhorses date back to ancient Greece but
remain a favorite toy for space-age tots. Ask Chuck Sakolsky, who
was in charge of making and selling nearly $5.5 million worth last
year.
   ``The funny thing is that even though it is a rocket-ship world,
kids' interest in horses has never gone away. The hobbyhorse is as
basic to the toy business as anything there is,'' said Sakolsky,
general manager of the Wonder Products Inc. factory in northwest
Louisiana's Bossier City, near Shreveport.
   The Wonder horse _ a heavy-duty plastic horse molded in
mid-gallop and held up by strong steel springs _ is a 20th century
descendant of the hobbyhorse, a stick with a horse's head at one
end.
   Toy historians have traced hobbyhorses to the time of Socrates
and to illustrations in a French book of Hours in the 15th Century.
No references to rocking horses are known before the 17th century,
but whenever they were invented, they had become immensely popular
by the 1800s.
   Wonder introduced the spring-mounted horse in 1939, Sakolsky
said, and bouncing horses had all but eliminated American-made
molded rocking horses from toy departments by the middle 1970s.
   ``Mostly what's out there are flat pieces of wood put together
to look like a horse,'' he said, adding that most of today's molded
horses on rockers are imported and are either expensive or cheap.
   The Wonder company plans to reintroduce its rocking horse this
year, capitalizing on growing nostalgia among parents and older
people.
   Like the rocking horse, Wonder is coming back from almost
nothing.
   The company was founded in Memphis; the move to Bossier City
came after it had been sold twice. CBS Inc., the broadcasting and
entertainment concern that owned a Louisiana swingset company
called Gym Dandy, put the two together.
   ``CBS got out of the toy business a couple years back.... They
sold the company to some of its managers. They really didn't have
the wherewithal to keep it going,'' he said.
   Basic or not, the company went under. Rotocast Plastic Products
Inc. of Miami bought it for $2.5 million last year at a sheriff's
sale and brought in Sakolsky to run it.
   ``We've doubled our business since 1987 and we'll double it
again in 1990,'' he said.
   Sakolsky estimated that Wonder sold about $3 million worth of
toys in 1988, $5.5 million in 1989 and will probably sell nearly
$10 million worth in 1990. He declined to give the number of toys
sold but said the company has relationships with retailers ranging
from large toy chains to small shops.
   ``At one time, we had close to 70 percent of the market,'' he
said. ``In 1988, I think we had around 30 percent. I believe we'll
have 50 percent of the market by 1990.''
   The company's mainstay remains the spring-mounted horse, which
retails anywhere from $40 _ for a 28-inch model suitable for a 2-or
3-year-old _ to more than $100.
   ``We have palominos, roans, pintos ... we're coming out with a
dapple gray,'' he said.
   Sakolsky also has gone back through 40 years of catalogs to find
products worth bringing back, and has created a couple of his own.
   Last year the company introduced a horse of a brighter color _ a
hand-painted replica of a 1914 carousel horse, painted in vivid
merry-go-round hues, priced at $150. The same horse, mounted on a
brass pole and sold as furniture, retails for up to $500.
   ``It is the Rolls Royce of the ride-on horses,'' said Sakolsky.
``I sort of think of these as grandmother horses, because it's the
sort of thing a grandmother looks at and says, `Gee _ that's what
my grandchild has to have.'''

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in
December, despite a cold-weather jump in fuel oil costs, bringing
inflation for 1989 to an eight-year high of 4.6 percent, the
government said today.
   The rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index marked a
modest acceleration over the 4.4 percent rates posted in 1988 and
1987. Still, it was the steepest increase since 1981, when prices
shot up 8.9 percent in a lingering aftershock from the double-digit
inflation of 1979 and 1980.
   The seasonally adjusted increase in December was a bit lower
than many analysts predicted, but financial markets declined anyway.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2.77 points
in the first 90 minutes of trading to 2,656.36. Traders cited
concern over lackluster corporate earnings and rising interest
rates.
   Worry over higher rates was fueled by comments from two Federal
Reserve Board members, who were quoted in The Wall Street Journal
today. Their remarks are being interpreted as suggesting the
central bank won't reduce short-term interest rates, at least for
now.
   Countering that, the Bush administration broke with its usual
no-comment stance on Fed policy. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said ``lower rates are justified'' and expressed concern
over a sharp decline in housing starts last month.
   The Commerce Department said housing starts dropped 8 percent in
December as the cold weather slowed construction and ended down 7.6
percent for the year, the lowest level since the recession year of
1982.
   It said 1.37 million units of new homes and apartments were
started last year, compared with 1.49 million units in 1988. Most
analysts predicted starts would rebound in January.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said in another report that
Americans' inflation-adjusted earnings were unchanged in December
after falling 0.6 percent in November. Average weekly earnings were
$340.81 in December, up 3.2 percent from a year earlier _ not
enough to keep up with inflation.
   Food prices jumped 5.6 percent in 1989, their steepest rise in
nine years, beating the drought-induced increase of 5.2 percent in
1988.
   For December, food costs were up 0.4 percent, the same as
November. Many analysts had expected the unseasonably cold weather
near the end of the month to drive up fruit and vegetable prices.
However, those prices actually fell 1.3 percent. The full force of
the freeze, which dipped as far south as Florida and Texas, likely
will show up in January prices.
   Dairy products rose a sharp 2.2 percent in December, bringing
the increase for the year to 10.3 percent. Economists say dairy
prices in 1989 were still reacting to increased slaughtering of
herds during the previous summer's drought.
   The price of meat, poultry fish and eggs jumped 1.0 percent in
December.
   Much of that was attributed to a 3.7 percent advance in egg
prices, which climbed 35.4 for the year.
   Energy prices gained 5.1 percent last year, driven up by a 19.5
percent rise in fuel oil prices. Fuel oil increased 3.8 percent in
December and a congressional committee is investigating allegations
that oil companies used the cold weather as an excuse to grab
profits.
   Gasoline prices, which soared early in the year, fell in six of
the last seven months of 1989, including a 2.0 percent drop in
December. For the year, they were up 6.5 percent.
   Natural gas prices increased 2.1 percent last month, while
electricity rose 0.8 percent.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose 0.4
percent in December and 4.4 percent for the year, a drop from 4.7
percent in 1988.
   Analysts often look to this figure as a better indicator of
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. They attribute
the slowing in 1989 to economic sluggishness induced by the Federal
Rserve Board, which fought inflation in the first half of the year
by boosting interest rates.
   Most economists are expecting a modest improvement in overall
inflation this year but some warn that inflation will be stubborn,
largely because the low unemployment rate is keeping wages rising.
   The cost of services, the catagory most heavily influenced by
wages, rose 0.4 percent in December and 5.1 percent for the year.
   In other details:
   _New car prices jumped 1.0 percent in December, but for the year
were up only 2.3 percent, held back by repeated discounting as
dealers faced sluggish sales.
   _The cost of medical care rose 0.5 percent last month and 8.5
percent for the year. Medical care costs have consistently risen
faster than the general inflation rate.
   _Clothing costs fell 0.7 percent in December, the result of
pre-Christmas reductions. For the year, they rose only 1.0 percent.
Analysts say the relatively strong dollar has held down the price
of clothing imports.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer
Price Index stood at 126.1 percent in December. That meant a
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the
1982-84 base period would have cost $126.10 last month, up from
$120.50 a year earlier.

<HEAD>Soviet Rumors Lift Soybean Futures; Grains Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices opened slightly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid talk of Soviet buying
interest. Wheat and corn futures were narrowly mixed.
   Traders said exporters reported indications that the Soviets
bought about 150,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans in recent days.
   But others said the early rally was technically inspired after
four days of lower prices.
   The dull opening in the wheat and corn markets reflected a lack
of significant new supply-and-demand developments. Traders
discounted a rumor that China had bought 200,000 metric tons of
U.S. corn.
   The Soviet Union was said to be bidding for 500,000 metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, but that business has been
largely factored into the market already.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $4.01\ a bushel;
corn futures were unchanged to { cent higher with March at $2.42 a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with March at $1.37{ a
bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1{ cents higher with January at
$5.58{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .08 cent to .33 cent higher with
February at 78.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with January at 83.77 cents a pound; live hogs
were .05 cent to .43 cent higher with February at 50.20 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to .90 cent higher with
February at 57.05 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures made strong gains on Wednesday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. today
proposed to offer its residential, business and international
customers special Valentine's Day discounts on long-distance calls
to try to make amends for the near collapse of its network earlier
this week.
   In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission, the
company said it was seeking approval to declare Feb. 14 as an
additional day of holiday calling.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen said: ``We are making this gesture
to underscore how much we value our relationship with our
customers, knowing there is no way to make up for the inconvenience
they may have experienced.''
   AT&amp;T's special holiday prices, discounted by an average 33
percent from regular weekday prices, will apply on all
out-of-state, direct-dialed calls made by customers on AT&amp;T's
public network.
   In addition, AT&amp;T said price discounts also would apply for
customers of its 800 services.
   AT&amp;T suffered a nine-hour outage to long-distance service
nationwide on Monday that was traced to a bug in a new software
program.
   Allen on Tuesday said he believed the outage in a call-switching
network was a ``one-time hit'' against a network that serves 80
million long-distance customers. AT&amp;T handles about 70 percent of
the nation's interstate calling.
   Until the problem was contained, more than half of the calls
placed on AT&amp;T's nationwide network did not go through, the company
said.
   The company had said that billings would be adjusted to reflect
the outage, but details were not given in today's statement.
   AT&amp;T said said the problem stemmed from a bug, or ``logic''
problem, inadvertently written into the software in a New York
computer that helps direct calls through the vast network. The
problem spread to more than 100 switching centers.
   Allen said he could not estimate losses to AT&amp;T or its customers.
   AT&amp;T has insurance to cover customers' losses stemming from the
trouble with its 800-number toll-free service but does not have
coverage for business customers using regular long-distance
circuits.
   Some analysts said the disruption could be a boon to AT&amp;T's
rivals.

<HEAD>National Australia Bank To Buy Yorkshire Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yorkshire Bank PLC shareholders announced Thursday
they agreed to sell the regional bank to National Australia Bank
for the equivalent of $1.65 billion.
   Under terms of the deal, which must be approved by British
regulators, National Australia Bank, one of Australia's big four
commercial banks, will pay $1.6 billion in cash plus interest.
   Yorkshire Bank is owned by National Westminster Bank PLC, which
has a 40 percent stake; Barclays PLC, with 32 percent; Lloyds Bank
PLC, with 20 percent; and the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, with 8
percent.
   The banks, which put the Yorkshire bank up for sale in October,
said the proceeds would be used to strengthen their individual
reserves.
   Natwest Chairman Lord Alexander said shareholders decided to
sell Yorkshire because it was now fully competitive, and the price
represented a good return on their investment.
   National Australia Bank, which bought Clydesdale Bank, Northern
Bank and National Irish Bank in 1987, said it intends to preserve
Yorkshire's separate identity and build on the existing management
team.
   National Australia Bank Chairman Sir Rupert Clarke said he
believes in a hands-off approach to its subsidiaries and would
allow Yorkshire a good deal of independence to develop.
   Yorkshire, market leader in the number of personal accounts in
its northeast region, operates 250 branches.
   It had after-tax profit of $117 million in 1989, up from $104
million in 1988.

<TEXT>
   World crude steel output rose to a
record of 783.5 million metric tons in 1989, up 0.5 percent from
1988, the International Iron and Steel Institute said Thursday.
   The rise was led by developing countries, which increased output
by 3.7 percent to a record 100.9 million tons, from 97.3 million
tons in 1988, the institute said.
   In the Western nations, production stood at 495.9 million tons
in 1989, up 1.4 percent from 488.9 million tons in 1988, the survey
of 33 steel producing countries showed.
   Japanese steel producers lifted output by 2.1 percent in 1989 to
107.9 million tons, from 105.7 million tons a year earlier, while
the 12-nation European Community increased production 1.5 percent
to 139.8 million tons, from 137.7 million tons.
   Steel production in other countries showed small decreases, the
institute said. In the Soviet Union and other East bloc nations,
steel output dipped 2.4 percent to 219.5 million tons, from 224.8
million tons in 1988.

   The student charged with creating a
``worm'' that crippled about 6,000 computers testified today that
he intended to make it controllable but it grew to be unstoppable
in the time it took him to go out to dinner.
   Under questioning from his defense attorney in federal court,
Robert Morris said he thought the computer worm would duplicate a
few times a day or every few hours. Instead, the worm spread ``far
faster than I expected,'' he said.
   ``My intention was that it should not grow,'' Morris said.
``Once I released it ... I couldn't control it.''
   The Cornell University graduate student said he released the
worm into the Internet computer network about 8 p.m. on Dec. 2,
1988, then went out for dinner. When he returned about three hours
later, he said, he noticed Cornell's own computer was slow to
respond to commands.
   Morris testified that he released the worm into the national
network through computers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge, Mass. In computer terminology, a worm is a
variant of so-called ``virus'' programs that can cause damage when
they duplicate in computers.
   Morris said that when he found copies of the worm in the Cornell
system in Ithaca, N.Y., where he was working from, he knew it was
spreading and he realized it wasn't working right. He said he
started to get scared.
   Morris said he considered sending out a second worm designed to
track down and destroy the first worm. But he decided it wouldn't
work because of the unpredictable nature of the first worm and the
way it curtailed his own access to the computer system.
   Instead, he said he called Andrew Sudduth, a friend at Harvard
University, and asked him to send a message on an electronic
bulletin board read primarily by Internet users apologizing for
unleashing the worm and explaining how to eliminate it.
   Sudduth testified at Morris' trial Wednesday that he eventually
did send a warning message, but that it didn't show up on the
computer system for two days because the route he picked to keep
his identity a secret was backed up with electronic mail.
   Defense attorney Thomas Guidoboni has argued that Morris had no
criminal intent in designing the worm because he never realized it
would cripple the computer network. If convicted, Morris, 25, of
Arnold, Md., faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   A government witness testifying Wednesday, Harvard graduate
student Paul Graham, said Morris frantically called him for help.
   ``He sounded like he had a final the next day that he hadn't
studied for. He sounded miserable. He sounded in a state of shock
and horror,'' Graham told the jury.
   Morris stressed in testimony today that he had no intention to
read anyone else's private computer files, or cause damage or leave
any permanent files on the computers that were attacked.

<HEAD>Texaco Posts Lower Fourth-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc.'s profit slipped in the fourth quarter due mainly to
a $355 million charge for environmental improvement programs, while
annual earnings nearly doubled, the oil company reported Thursday.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, Texaco's after-tax
earnings were $287 million, or 99 cents a share, down 3 percent
from $296 million, or $1.21 a share in the comparable 1988 period.
Revenue rose 9 percent to $9.2 billion from $8.5 billion.
   Texaco, the nation's third largest petroleum company behind
Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., said it established financial reserves
totaling $355 million for environmental improvement programs
planned at its manufacturing, marketing and production facilities.
   ``The company is committed to its role in safeguarding and
maintaining the environment in which it operates,'' said James W.
Kinnear, president and chief executive officer of the White Plains,
N.Y.-based company.
   Texaco officials would not elaborate on the company's decision
to set aside the reserves. It comes nearly a year after Exxon's
image was tarnished by the nation's worst oil spill in Alaska last
March. More recently, Exxon has come under scrutiny for an
underwater oil pipeline leak that fouled a New York City waterway.
Exxon originally blamed the mishap on a faulty leak-detection alarm.
   Texaco said fourth-quarter earnings also reflected the
devaluation of an investment in an offshore California oil
production facility.
   For all of 1989, Texaco's earnings soared 85 percent to $2.4
billion or $9.12 a share, from $1.3 billion or $5.35 a share the
previous year. Revenue edged up about 2 percent to $35.7 billion
from $35 billion.
   Included in the yearly figures was a net restructuring gain of
$1.6 billion, or $6.02 a share, mainly from the sale of its
lucrative Texaco Canada Inc. subsidiary to Exxon's Imperial Oil
Ltd. of Canada for about $3.24 billion.
   Texaco said the latest results showed gains in exploration and
production earnings. Earnings from downstream, or marketing and
refining, businesses suffered due to rising crude oil costs, while
its petrochemicals earnings also declined, Texaco said.

<HEAD>Continental Cuts Managers' Merit Raises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines has frozen merit raises for
its managers in the latest of a series of employee cutbacks.
   Continental managers said they were told last week not to expect
the merit raises normally available every six months until later
this year.
   ``Merit increases are being postponed until sometime in the
fall,'' Continental spokesman Art Kent said Wednesday.
   A week ago, Houston-based Continental laid off about 150
employees nationwide, mostly middle-level managers. But company
officials said the group represented a small fraction of its 35,000
workers, some 11,000 of which are in Houston.
   Kent said managers were told about the raises when they met in
Houston last week to discuss the airline's performance.
   ``Every so often during the year we bring all the management
people into Houston,'' Kent said. ``We brought everybody up to date
on 1989, what our plans were for 1990.''
   Continental, reacting to skyrocketing jet fuel costs in recent
weeks, led an industrywide effort to increase fares by 4 percent to
help offset the costs.
   Jet fuel prices rose from a low of 49.4 cents a gallon in
November 1988 to 65.9 cents in November 1989. In December, prices
hit $1.10 a gallon and many airlines this week were still paying
more than 90 cents a gallon.
   At the same time, Continental launched new fares _ some as low
as $9 one way _ to help boost weak winter passenger traffic in 11
cities in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
   Continental's sister carrier, Eastern Airlines, has been
restructured as a smaller airline in the wake of a crippling strike
that started last March 4. Eastern has about 20,000 employees,
mostly non-union replacement workers, down from 32,000 before the
strike.
   Continental and Eastern are the main subsidiaries of
Houston-based Texas Air Corp., the nation's largest airline company.

after mid-summer and transfer the manufacturing operation to its
Wellston, Ohio, facility.
   In addition, a coupon redemption processing operation in Golden
Valley will be transferred to an outside company.
   Most of the expected 1,300 job eliminations will take place in
1991. However, about 800 new jobs will be created during the next
18 months of the investment program's implementation, the company
said.
   Among other key changes:
   _Grocery product lines in its Springfield, Ill., plant, and dry
grocery activities in Terre Haute, Ind., would be transferred to a
facility in Murfreesboro, Tenn.
   _A distribution center in Chattanooga, Tenn., will be closed and
the activity taken over by the Murfreesboro distribution center.
   _In the pizza and frozen vegetable division, the Wellston, Ohio,
plant will be expanded and a 160,000-square-foot frozen
distribution center will be created. Wellston also will receive new
pizza capability for its Jeno's and Totino's brands, plus new
vegetable processing lines for its Green Giant brands. Frozen
distribution capability in Belvidere, Ill., also will be created.
   _Vegetable processing at the Watsonville, Calif., plant will
shift to Wellston and other existing facilities over the next year.
The long-term status of Watsonville is reviewed.
   Paul S. Walsh, Pillsbury's chief operating officer, said the
investment program is ``a continuation of efforts to make Pillsbury
even better equipped to compete successfully in the fast-changing
global food industry. These actions will create a stronger company
for the 1990s...''
   Walsh said the plans were announced ``as early as possible to
allow our employees to take full advantage of outplacement
counseling, skills assessment, benefits counseling and educational
workshops.'' He said the programs would be included in extensive
job transition assistance available at all affected locations.

   Lufthansa German Airlines said Thursday it is
buying enough General Electric engines to power up to 56 planes,
but is not ready to announce any aircraft purchases.
   Spokeswoman Lucille Hoshabjian in New York said the airline may
convert options for 15 Boeing Co. planes to firm orders but has no
announcement planned.
   Reports on Wednesday had indicated the airline would order as
many as 41 747-400s from Boeing.
   The airline has an outstanding firm order for 15 747-400s, five
of which have been delivered.
   The 747-400 is the world's largest passenger jet, with advanced
technology that a crew of two instead of the three required for
comparable aircraft. It carries up to 509 passengers depending on
its configuration.

   The top securities regulators of the United States
and Japan agreed Thursday to take steps to ensure instant
communications during sudden market plunges.
   Officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Japanese Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau said they had
designated facsimile lines and bilingual contact people for
emergency communications in times of turmoil.
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden also
requested greater access to information on insider trading, which
his Japanese counterpart, Masahiko Kadotani, promised to consider.
   Breeden said a 700 percent growth in Japanese participation in
the U.S. securities market and a 500 percent increase in U.S.
trading in Japanese equities since 1985 required greater
cooperation on investor protection.
   ``Just as capital flows across borders, so does fraud,'' Breeden
said.
   Kadotani said he requested information about computerized
program trading from the U.S. delegation because the method of
trading stocks and stock-index futures simultaneously is new in
Japan.
   Program trading, in which millions of shares can be traded
rapid-fire, has been blamed for accelerating sudden swings in the
market. Breeden said his data showed program trading made up 30
percent of market volume at times during a 190-point plunge on the
New York Stock Exchange last Oct. 13.
   Asked whether program trading was responsible for recent sharp
declines in the Tokyo market, Kadotani said its role was not
significant but could become so in the future.
   At the fourth annual meeting between the sides, the countries'
top financial regulators also nudged each other to open each
other's markets.
   ``Among our objectives is moving toward a system where
securities offerings can occur simultaneously in the U.S. and
Japan,'' Breeden said.
   But he admitted this would not occur soon and added, ``It is an
objective that will enhance the efficiency of capital flows around
the world.''
   Kadotani, director general of the Japan's Securities Bureau,
said he had requested that Japanese firms be allowed to operate
investment trusts, such as mutual funds, in the United States.
   Breeden said the SEC had recommended introducing such
legislation in 1984, but that Congress had not passed it.
   But in a climate in the United States demanding more access to
Japanese markets, he said, ``congressional willingness to pass such
legislation will be affected by progress in Japan'' on allowing
similar foreign activity.

   Stock prices finished a volatile session sharply
lower Thursday as nervousness over the outlook for global markets
continued to undermine trading.'
   Early weakness on Wall Street sent investors running for cover,
abandoning equity positions, dealers said.
   At the London session drew to a close, the Dow Jones industrial
average was off more than 23 points following a 33-point decline
Wednesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended the
session down 37.0 points, or 1.6 percent, at 2,336.9.
   In the last two weeks, the index has lost roughly 150 points,
confounding market watchers who had generally predicted a sharp
January rally.
   ``It's been very volatile but volume is poor which tends to
exaggerate things all the more,'' a dealer said.
   Market watchers said investors were jittery over declines in
world bond markets and rising concern about interest rates. In
addition, instability in the Soviet Union, domestic worries over
wage inflation and upcoming strikes also soured any interest in
equities, dealers said.
   The Financial Times 30-share index lost 30.9 points to close at
1,864.4. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 18.99 points to
1,275.64 at the close.
   Volume was a modest 450.2 million shares, compared with 429
million shares Wednesday.

   Housing starts slumped in 1989 to their lowest
level since the 1982 recession, the government said Thursday, but
many analysts looked for further drops in mortgage rates to improve
the situation in 1990.
   ``The drop in December housing starts is primarily due to severe
weather in most of the nation last month,'' said John A. Tuccillo,
chief economist for the National Association of Realtors.
   The frigid weather pushed December starts to their lowest
monthly level since October 1982, which in turn contributed to the
year's downturn.
   The Commerce Department said construction of new homes and
apartments tumbled 8 percent in December and helped drop total 1989
starts to 1.37 million units _ the lowest since 1982's 1.06 million
units. Starts totaled 1.49 million in 1988.
   The housing industry had been sluggish through much of the year
as the Federal Reserve pushed up interest rates by keeping a tight
rein on credit as it sought to slow the economy and curtail
inflation.
   But as concerns grew that the economy might be slowing too much,
the Fed allowed interest rates to fall gradually in recent months.
   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, which looks for 1.45 million starts this year, said
the forecast ``is predicated on our belief that rates are headed
down.''
   David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, also is counting on a ``moderate decline in interest
rates in the first half of the year'' to sustain his organization's
forecast for 1.38 million starts in 1990.
   On the other hand, David Berson, chief economist for the Federal
National Mortgage Association, looks for interest rates to edge up
for much of the year and for starts to edge down.
   Commerce said new homes and apartments were built at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.24 million in December, down
from a revised 1.34 million in November and 1.42 million in October.
   Construction of single-family homes plummeted 10 percent to an
annual rate of 904,000 units after a 2 percent drop in November.
That was the lowest since 862,000 units in December 1982 as the
economy began emerging from the recession.
   But Fannie Mae's Berson said conditions were such that, if it
had not been for the weather, single-family starts would have gone
up. And if January's improved weather continues, he said starts
might rebound and even steal some that otherwise would take place
in February.
   Apartment construction fell 2.4 percent to an annual rate of
331,000 units, compared with a 15.3 percent decline in November,
and analysts said overbuilding in recent years will keep this
sector weak.
   The severe weather was widespread east of the Rockies, and
starts in those regions posted the biggest declines. Starts were
down 23.3 percent in the Northeast to 138,000 units, down 10
percent in the South to 439,000 units and down 9.8 percent in the
Midwest to 268,000 units.
   Starts rose only in the West, where they gained 3.4 percent to
390,000 units.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, edged down 0.4 percent in December. During all of 1989,
1.34 million permits were issued, the lowest number since 1 million
in 1982.

<HEAD>Union Pacific Earnings Drop 11 Percent in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. said Thursday
fourth-quarter net earnings fell 11 percent from a year ago, when
results included gains from the sale of refinery operations.
   The Bethlehem, Pa.-based company, whose assets include railroad,
energy, trucking, waste management and real estate, said it earned
$166.8 million, or $1.64 a share, down from $187.4 million, or
$1.65 a share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   Revenue totaled $1.74 billion, up 10 percent from $1.6 billion.
   Union Pacific Railroad, the nation's third-largest in freight
revenue, earned $143 million in the quarter, up $700,000 from a
year earlier. The railroad operates in 19 states, primarily in the
West and Southwest.
   For the year, Union Pacific's profit dropped 8 percent to $594.5
million, or $5.62 a share, on revenues of $6.5 billion. That
compares with net income of $643.9 million, or $5.65 a share, on
revenues of $6.1 billion in 1988.
   The railroad reported a record annual profit of $547.3 million,
up 6 percent from $516.1 million in 1988, despite tough market
conditions and a 20 percent increase in fuel costs. Carloadings
increased 1 percent, including traffic added by the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, commonly known as the Katy, which
Union Pacific bought in 1988.
   Traffic was hampered by severe winter weather, slow auto sales,
a sluggish grain market and a decline in housing starts.
   ``Our financial results for 1989 were very encouraging in light
of the highly competitive marketplace,'' said Drew Lewis, chief
executive officer. ``If the economy does not take a serious
downturn and energy prices remain strong, we should have a solid
earnings performance in 1990.''
   Separately, Union Pacific told industry analysts Thursday it is
exploring the possibility of a joint venture with its energy and
minerals subsidiary, Union Pacific Resources Co., which had
earnings of $51 million, up 18 percent after discounting the sale
of the refineries. The company said in a statement it is also
considering the sale of less than 20 percent of the subsidiaries'
shares.
   Union Pacific Resources also announced it had made four offshore
discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico that could produce up to 100
million cubic feet of natural gas per day.

   Stock prices fell again today, extending their
early-1990 slide amid uneasiness over weak corporate earnings and
rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 33.49 on
Wednesday, dropped 14.29 points to 2,644.84 by 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 404 up, 1,048 down
and 461 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market was unsettled by a series of adverse
corporate earnings reports over the past couple of days.
   The latest came this morning when Digital Equipment posted
earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 30 of $1.25 a share,
against $2.20 a share in the like period a year earlier.
   Digital's shares tumbled 6&lsqb; to 81} after a delayed opening.
   Selling continued, meanwhile in Aluminum Co. of America, down 1\
at 65|, and International Business Machines, down \ at 98|, after
the two companies reported lower quarterly profits on Wednesday.
   Alcan Aluminium, which also posted a quarterly earnings decline,
dropped &rsqb; to 20~.
   At the same time, brokers said fears of a developing recession
were intensified by recent upward pressure on interest rates in
this country and in other leading industrialized countries.
   Rising rates in Japan, Germany and England are seen as a
deterrant to any move soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its
credit policy.
   Fed policymakers are believed to be concerned that lower rates
in the United States would prompt a flow of money out of American
credit markets into foreign securities with increasingly attractive
yields.
   That perception has helped push U.S. interest rates higher in
the past several days.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.04 to 185.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.36 at 365.70.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 133.80 million shares with two
hours to go.

   PPG Industries Inc., a producer of glass,
coatings and chemicals, said Thursday its earnings dropped 0.8
percent in the final three months of 1989, partly because of weak
construction activity.
   PPG said other reasons for the decline were the cost of product
development and plant operation and reduced demand for fiber glass
textile.
   For the fourth quarter, earnings totaled $101.4 million or 93
cents per share on sales of $1.4 billion. That compared with $102.3
million or 94 cents per share on sales of $1.4 billion in the same
period a year earlier.
   PPG said its coatings business benefited during the quarter from
strong automotive refinish activity. Reduced coatings sales to U.S.
automakers were offset somewhat by increased sales to transplant
automakers, the company said.
   Earnings for all of 1989 fell 0.5 percent to $465.2 million or
$4.18 per share on sales of $5.7 billion, from $467.6 million or
$4.26 per share on sales of $5.6 billion in 1988.

<TEXT>
   In a stock market driven up partly by ``red chip''
shares, is it any surprise that rumors about Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev contribute to nervous moves in share prices?
   No, say watchers of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where capitalists
have been placing some of their gambles on the Communists.
   This turn of events, unthinkable a few years ago, has its own
internal logic.
   Peace is good for business, especially in Japan, where the
defense industry is a small sector of the economy. Gorbachev and
President Bush made progress toward better relations at their Malta
summit.
   Eastern European countries are opening their doors to outside
business, and Japanese firms with possible deals in Poland, Hungary
or the Soviet Union _ the ``red chip'' stocks _ could be winners.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange rode these two trends in the East bloc
to a record high at the end of 1989. But since then the key Nikkei
stock index has been moving almost exclusively downward.
   Since the Soviet Union internal situation appears increasingly
chaotic, doing business in the old East bloc may not be simple. If
Gorbachev were to leave office for any reason or if he is forced to
abandon plans for a more open economy, business prospects could dim.
   So rumors hinting at the Soviet leader's resignation or
diminution of power tend to lower confidence, and recent rumors in
part explain the market's downtick.
   If such events occur, investors may unload ``red chip'' shares
in trading companies and firms dealing in consumer electronic goods
and environmental equipment, thought most likely to be able to do
well in Eastern Europe.
   ``Some market participants here are not so interested in
fundamentals,'' such as the price of the dollar or movement of
interest rates, said Jan VanDenBerg, senior economist at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. in Tokyo.
   Sales people, she said, ``have a tendency to couch something in
terms of a rumor rather than in terms of a fundamental.''
   On Jan. 5, the second day of trading this year, the Tokyo Nikkei
225-share index plunged 438 points, more than 1 percent, on rumors
that Gorbachev had canceled all meetings with foreign visitors to
deal with domestic problems.
   The Soviet president had put off a meeting with British Labor
Party leader Neil Kinnock, but former Japanese Foreign Minister
Shintaro Abe soon after announced a trip to Moscow to talk with
Gorbachev.
   When the Tokyo exchange closed Wednesday, the Nikkei 225-share
index was at 36,821.14, about 5 percent below the record quote of
38,915.87 at the end of 1989. Again, rumors that Gorbachev was on
his way out were part of the reason, analysts said.
   ``Gorbachev will probably have to die a thousand times in such
rumors this year,'' Yamaichi Securities analyst Kenji Maeshiro said.
   The ``peace dividend'' feeling that pulled the market up in
December _ a belief that U.S.-Soviet tensions would be reduced by
Eastern Europe's democracy movement _ was buttressed by a consensus
that Japan's central bank would not raise interest rates until
after a national election in February.
   But the bank confounded that consensus by raising the discount
rate on Dec. 25, contributing to a loss of momentum. The dollar
also has been strong against the yen, which could boost inflation
in Japan, another confidence-cutter.
   Lately, though, rumors have been center stage, not a new
phenomenon for stock exchanges. Several years ago, the London
markets took shock dips over rumors that President Reagan had died.
   A broker at a foreign securities firm who asked not to be named
said Wednesday's rumor about Gorbachev ``losing his power base''
probably came from ``a bored investor'' in the foreign exchange
market.
   He said a Gorbachev resignation story last week started when
someone misread a news item.
   The broker then passed on something that may or may not be as
true as a Gorbachev rumor _ his guess that ``the market is now
oversold and shouldn't go down any more.''

1,009 down and 461 unchanged.
   Analysts said the market was unsettled by a series of adverse
corporate earnings reports over the past couple of days.
   The latest came this morning when Digital Equipment posted
earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 30 of $1.25 a share,
against $2.20 a share in the like period a year earlier.
   Digital's shares tumbled 5~ to 82 after a delayed opening.
   Selling continued, meanwhile in Aluminum Co. of America, down 1&lsqb;
at 65|, after the company reported lower quarterly profits on
Wednesday.
   Alcan Aluminium, which also posted a quarterly earnings decline,
dropped \ to 21 in active trading.
   At the same time, brokers said fears of a developing recession
were intensified by recent upward pressure on interest rates in
this country and in other leading industrialized countries.
   Rising rates in Japan, Germany and England are seen as a
deterrant to any move soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its
credit policy.
   Fed policymakers are believed to be concerned that lower rates
in the United States would prompt a flow of money out of American
credit markets into foreign securities with increasingly attractive
yields.
   That perception has helped push U.S. interest rates higher in
the past several days.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.50 to 186.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.22 at 365.84.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 150.78 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Fall On Heavy Precip Forecast</HEAD>

   Wheat futures prices closed at 3{-month lows
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade after tumbling late in the
session on forecasts for heavy snow and rain in the heart of the
U.S. winter wheat country.
   Oat futures also retreated while corn and soybeans advanced.
   The heavy precipitation predicted for Thursday night and Friday
in the winter wheat fields of the Southern Plains would help
relieve the unusally dry conditions that have prevailed there since
late autumn.
   ``They are likely to get as much snow today, tonight and
tomorrow as they usually get in January or February,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   ``This is the biggest rain event since September,'' she said.
   The soybean market was supported by indications that the Soviet
Union bought about 150,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans in recent
days.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1} cents to 3{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.97{ a bushel, its lowest
close since Sept. 28.

<HEAD>More Mixed Results from Leading Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Five major U.S. banks reported mixed 1989 results Thursday, with
problem Third World debt and a depressed real estate market
plaguing some while others benefited from expansion and profitable
financial operations.
   BankAmerica Corp. enjoyed the best year in its history, but
precautions taken to cover potentially bad Third World debt put
Chemical Banking Corp. in the red and pushed Bank of New York Co.'s
earnings sharply lower for the year.
   Bank of Boston was adversely affected by a depressed real estate
market in New England, but super-regional NCNB Corp. continued to
plug away at developing new markets and reported a highly
profitable year.
   San Francisco-based BankAmerica, the nation's second-largest
bank holding concern behind New York's Citicorp, said earnings for
the quarter ended Dec. 31 totaled $270 million, or $1.21 per share,
a slight increase from the $265 million, or $1.36 per share, from
the year-ago period.
   Earnings for the full year soared 52 percent to $1.1 billion, or
$5.19 a share, the highest annual profit in its history. In 1988
the bank earned $726 million, $3.79 per share.
   The performance marks a dramatic comeback for BankAmerica,
parent of Bank of America, that included a nearly $1 billion loss
in 1987.
   Chemical Banking Corp., the sixth-largest banking concern, said
fourth-quarter earnings fell to $95.9 million or $1.04 a share,
down 67 percent from $288.5 million or $4.66 a share in the final
quarter of 1988.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, Chemical reported a net loss of
$482.2 million, or the equivalent of $8.29 a share, compared with a
profit of $753.6 million, or $12.02 a share in 1988.
   The loss resulted partly from a $600 million increase in
Chemical's reserves for problem loans to less developed countries,
which was taken in the third quarter.
   Chemical joined a long list of major U.S. banks that moved to
bolster their reserves to cover possibly bad debt.
   No. 10-ranked Bank of New York Co., bolstered by its acquisition
of Irving Trust Co., reported fourth-quarter earnings nearly
doubled to $106.6 million, or $1.43 a share, from $54.7 million, or
$1.10 a share in the final quarter of 1988.
   For the full year, however, a $600 million increase in Bank of
New York's allowance for loan losses, which was recorded in the
third quarter, pushed earnings down 76 percent, to $50.7 million,
or 27 cents a share. In 1988 the bank reported earnings of $213
million, or $5.21 a share.
   No. 14-ranked Bank of Boston Corp. was hit by the depressed New
England real estate market. The region's largest bank holding
company said earnings plummeted 89 percent in the fourth quarter to
$9 million, or 8 cents a share, from $83 million, or $1.13 a share
in the final quarter of 1988.
   For the full year, earnings plunged 78 percent to $70 million,
or 80 cents a share, from $322 million, or $4.43 a share a year
earlier.
   Bank of Boston increased its reserves to cover bad real estate
loans to $923 million, from $690 million a year earlier. The
company said its portfolio of troubled U.S. commercial real estate
assets had climbed to $1.1 billion as of Dec. 31, compared with
$618 million the previous year.
   Many New England banks have been hurt by the real estate slump,
as developers have had trouble making loan payments on projects
that were approved during a building boom earlier in the 1980s.
   No. 16-ranked NCNB Corp., the fast-growing bank holding company
based in Charlotte, N.C., reported fourth-quarter earnings
catapulted 112 percent to $136.2 million, or $1.30 a share, from
$64.3 million, or 69 cents a share in the period a year earlier.
   For the full year, NCNB said earnings rose 77 percent to $447.1
million, or $4.62 a share, compared with profits of $252.5 million,
or $2.90 a share in 1988.
   Bank officials attributed the performance in part to the
acquisition of NCNB Texas, which NCNB Chairman Hugh McColl noted
was completed four years ahead of schedule.

   Stock prices were mixed today at the close of a

   Analysts said blue chips benefited late in the day from buying
by professional traders engaged in multiple computer-program
strategies. But they described the overall news background as bleak.
   The market has been unsettled lately by a series of weak
corporate earnings reports for the last three months of 1989.

were intensified by recent upward pressure on interest rates in

<HEAD>Japanese Legislator Says He Wrote Book to Spur Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese legislator who created a firestorm
with a book attacking America said Thursday he is simply trying to
spur a more honest debate between the world's two economic
superpowers.
   Shintaro Ishihara's book, entitled ``The Japan That Can Say
`No,''' is a runaway best seller in Japan, with 500,000 copies
sold. While no authorized version exists in English, bootleg copies
translated by the Defense Department are creating quite a stir in
Washington.
   In the book, Ishihara argues that Japan needs to be more
assertive in standing up to America in policy disputes. He boasts
about Japan's technological superiority, calls America's military
shield for Japan an illusion and complains that ``Americans behave
more like mad dogs than watch dogs.''
   He dismisses American criticism of Japan as racially motivated
and suggests that unless America changes its tune, Tokyo might stop
supplying the microchips the Pentagon needs for accurate targeting
of U.S. nuclear missiles and sell them to the Soviets instead.
   Such a decision, Ishihara speculates in his book, ``would
instantly change the balance of military power.''
   In an interview Thursday, Ishihara did not recant any of his
comments although he contended that the ``pirated'' version now in
circulation in Washington leaves out certai clarifying comments.
   With Japan accounting for almost half of America's $111 billion
annual trade deficit, efforts to stem the flow of Japanese imports
and boost U.S. export sales are a prime topic on Capitol Hill.
Ishihara's book is being cited by critics of Japan as a prime
example of Japanese intransigence in dealing with trade problems.
   During an interview, Ishihara said that relations between the
United States and Japan were in a transition phase in which Japan
needed to play a more assertive role.
   ``We have come to a new era where a redefinition of the
U.S.-Japan relationship is called for,'' he said, adding that he
hoped his book would contribute to a franker discussion of the real
issues between the two countries.
   Ishihara, a member of the Japanese parliament and one of the
front-runners for prime minister last year, disputed contentions
that his views were out of the mainstream, citing the popularity of
his book as proof that many Japanese agree with his thoughts.
   Ishihara's book comes at a time when public opinion polls in
both the United States and Japan reflect a growing uneasiness.
Americans now rank Japan's economic prowess as a greater threat to
the United States than the Soviet's military might while a majority
of Japanese in a recent poll complained that the United States was
unfairly pressuring Japan on trade issues.
   During his Washington visit, Ishihara, 57, a member of Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu's conservative Liberal-Democratic Party, was
meeting with members of Congress and journalists, promoting the
idea of debates between Japanese and American lawmakers.
   He said he hoped to return to the United States after the
Japanese elections in February to hold the first of these debates.
He also plans to bring out the authorized English version of his
book in April, absent the portions in the Japanese version written
by Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita.
   Morita, who wrote several less inflamatory chapters of the
original book, has said he regretted his collaboration and is
refusing to participate in the English-language edition.
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., was one of the lawmakers who met
with Ishihara during his visit.
   After the session, Levin, whose district includes Detroit, said
he was not optimistic that there will be any quick resolution to
the trade problems separating the two countries.
   He called Ishihara's views ``a minority point of view'' but one
which American policy-makers ``need to take seriously and respond
to it.''

<HEAD>Analysts: Banking Regulators Closing on CenTrust</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About the only bright spot for troubled CenTrust
Savings Bank in recent days has been the spotlights illuminating
its 47-story downtown Miami tower.
   Just one day after announcing a $119 million fiscal year loss,
Florida's biggest thrift on Wednesday abandoned a proposal to merge
with Ensign Bank, a financially troubled institution led by cruise
ship magnate Ted Arison.
   Now, CenTrust is left with unbalanced books, a $1 billion
portfolio of high-risk junk bonds and the cost of operating 63
branches it hopes to sell to a California thrift.
   Some analysts speculated Thursday that federal regulators may be
close to taking over the institution.
   ``It looks to me that the time is growing nigh for federal
regulators to take over the show,'' said Henry Peltz, a banking
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in New York.
   Meanwhile, state officials are preparing a hearing to seek the
ouster of CenTrust Chairman David Paul, who is blamed for
encouraging the bank's lavish and unorthodox spending, which has
included a $30 million museum-quality painting collection, a
company yacht and huge salaries.
   Terrence McElroy, a spokesman for the Florida Office of
Comptroller, said a hearing date has not been set. CenTrust is
appealing a Dec. 20 state order to remove Paul, who had a $4.8
million salary from January 1988 to September 1989.
   The proposed merger with New York-based Ensign, announced two
weeks ago, was seen as one of few options left by CenTrust to avoid
federal takeover. Arison, estimated to be worth $2.86 billion by
Forbes magazine, was the deep pocket the thrift needed.
   Miami-based banking consultant Kenneth Thomas estimated CenTrust
would need at least $200 million from Arison or from privately held
Hamilton Holding Co., Ensign's parent, before it could be
considered solvent under current federal standards.
   Paul and Arison have worked together on several arts projects in
Miami.
   But the proposed deal was dropped following a chilly reception
from federal regulators, according to a statement from CenTrust and
Ensign.
   Analysts said federal banking regulators are discouraging
mergers of troubled thrifts.
   ``Their theory is putting two troubled institutions together
doesn't solve problems, it just multiplies them,'' said Richard
Freeman, at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
   Ensign, which has 27 branches in metropolitan New York and
Florida, was more than $140 million insolvent, according to figures
by Sheshunoff Information Services in Austin, Texas.
   Arison, majority owner of Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.
and 50 percent of the National Basketball Association's Miami Heat,
could not be reached for comment Thursday.
   Paul did not return telephone calls to his Miami office, but New
York-based CenTrust spokesman Roy Winnick said no new plans are
expected ``in the immediate future.''
   Thomas said officials from the Office of Thrift Supervision had
enough evidence to take over CenTrust in December, when regulators
seized control of First American Bank and Trust in Lake Worth and
City Federal Savings Bank of Bedminster, N.J., which had extensive
Florida real estate holdings.
   He estimates CenTrust could be spending more than $100,000 a
week on legal fees to fight the state order to remove Paul and
other federal court action concerning CenTrust spending.
   In addition, Thomas predicts CenTrust could take another $100
million loss this year from defaults and cut-rate sales of its junk
bond holdings.
   CenTrust is seeking federal approval for a $150 million sale of
63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank of Beverly Hills.
Calif. But some analysts say it is doubtful regulators will allow
CenTrust to lose most of its relatively healthy, consumer-oriented
operations.
   ``If CenTrust is valuable at all, it will be whole, not in
pieces,'' said Thomas.
   Moody's Investors Service in December downgraded CenTrust's
bonds and long-term deposits to among its lowest ratings, and
predicted federal intervention.
   ``It's a pretty negative situation,'' said Moody's analyst Mara
Hilderman.

   The dollar rose sharply Thursday against key
foreign currencies in active trading as the market appeared more
confident the Federal Reserve wouldn't cut interest rates any time
soon.
   Gold prices declined after gaining overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $410.20 a troy ounce, down $2.30 from Wednesday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$410.880 an ounce, off $2.10.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was bolstered by a report in
Thursday's Wall Street Journal quoting two Fed officials as saying
they wouldn't support a cut in short-term interest rates unless
economic conditions changed.
   Firm interest rates tend to support the dollar.
   Both the officials, Manuel Johnson, a Fed vice chairman, and
Wayne Angell, a Fed governor, had led a move toward lower interest
rates in recent months.
   Those statements were in contrast with sentiment from the White
House, which on Thursday broke with its usual practice of not
commenting on Fed policy by suggesting current economic conditions
justified rate cuts.
   Still, Ronald H. Holzer, a vice president at Harris Trust &amp; Co.
in Chicago, said, ``With the inflation picture looking as bad as it
does, the market was anticipating that the Fed had stopped easing.
These statements (by Johnson and Angell) confirmed it and brought
out good buying for the dollar.''
   Some dealers said the Fed had tried to thwart the dollar's rise
Thursday by selling dollars for yen, but the market ignored that
intervention.
   Also boosting dollar-buying interest Thursday was the continued
unrest in the Soviet Caucasus. The dollar is often seen as a safe
haven in times of political turmoil.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 145.66 Japanese yen, up from late
Wednesday's 145.52. The dollar traded at 146.05 yen in London, and
at 146.35 yen in New York, up from 145.395 yen.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound, too. Sterling
bought $1.6445 in London, down from Wednesday's $1.6525, and
$1.6435 in New York, down from $1.65235.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.7150 West German marks, up from
1.6873; 1.5245 Swiss francs, up from 1.5055; 5.8275 French francs,
up from 5.7325; 1,276.75 Italian lire, up from 1,256.50; and
1.17135 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16515.
   Late European rates for the dollar compared with Wednesday:
1.7095 marks, up from 1.6905; 1.5185 Swiss francs, up from 1.5023;
5.8090 French francs, up from 5.7250; 1.9130 Dutch guildrs, up from
1.8990; 1,272.00 Italian lire, up from 1,254.75; and 1.1713
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1640
   Gold rose in London to $413.75 an ounce from $409.75 Wednesday.
The late bid in Zurich was $413 an ounce, up from $409.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $413.95 an ounce, up from
$410.35.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.190 a troy ounce, down 6.6
cents. Silver rose in London to $5.26 an ounce from $5.23.

<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices ended mixed in volatile
trading Thursday, as crude and heating oil bounced back from
Wednesday's losses.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil rallied after
Wednesday's steep declines. The February contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 66 cents to
$22.76 a barrel after a 68-cent drop on Wednesday.
   March crude closed 33 cents higher at $21.59 a barrel while
April advanced 27 cents to $20.97.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heating
oil for February delivery climbed 1.32 cents to close at 61.84
cents a gallon. The contract lost 3.51 cents Wednesday.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for delivery in February slipped
0.71 cent to 60.71 cents a gallon, continuing its slide from the
previous session, when it lost 2.88 cents. Traders said gasoline
was under pressure after excessive gains in recent sessions.
   Heating oil appeared to be stabilizing after recent losses,
analysts said. Heating oil futures had rallied sharply after
December's unseasonably frigid weather that delayed shipments and
slowed refinery output in normally warm-weather areas like Texas
and Louisiana. Prices had receded in recent days as spring-like
temperatures knocked the punch out of the rally.
   ``The warm weather is already built into the market so prices
have stabilized,'' said Richard Redoglio, energy broker with
Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Futures prices fell broadly on Wednesday largely in response to
an industry report that showed a sharp rise in stocks of crude oil
and refined products in the nation's storage tanks.
   Analysts said Thursday's rise in crude oil resulted from a
combination of factors.
   ``It might be motivated by the tight situation on good-quality
crudes because of delays in Brent loadings in the North Sea,'' said
Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``But it
just might be a follow-up to the declines earlier this week.''

   Inflation increased modestly in 1989 to an
eight-year high of 4.6 percent, boosted by double-digit price
increases for dairy food, eggs, tobacco and fuel oil, the
government said Thursday.
   Construction of new housing, meanwhile, plunged 7.6 percent last
year to 1.37 million units, the lowest level since the recession
year of 1982.
   In December, consumer prices climbed a moderate 0.4 percent
despite a sharp rise in fuel oil costs during the holiday cold
snap. The weather also prompted a seasonally adjusted 8 percent
decline in housing starts from November to December, the steepest
in 10 months.
   Economists attributed both the relative stability of consumer
price increases and a weak housing industry to the Federal Reserve
Board's tight money policy.
   Although the central bank has eased its grip on credit in recent
months, the Bush administration quickly blasted a suggestion from
Federal Reserve policy-makers that interest rates will not fall
again anytime soon.
   ``These numbers ... indicate that inflation has remained very
steady over the last seven or eight years and that lower interest
rates are justified,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
in rare public criticism of the central bank.
   The administration is counting on strong economic growth to
bolster tax revenues and help it meet budget deficit targets.
   But Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson and board member Wayne
Angell, in remarks published in Thursday editions of The Wall
Street Journal, suggested little prospect of another interest-rate
cut in the near future.
   Financial markets, which have been spooked in recent weeks by
inflation fears, were mixed in volatile trading. Bond prices
plunged, while the Dow Jones industrial average, after a
roller-coaster ride, closed at 2,666.38, up 7.25. Traders said the
market was reacting more to disappointing corporate earnings
reports and worry over interest rates than to the slightly
better-than-expected inflation news.
   The 1989 rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
marked a modest acceleration over the 4.4 percent rates posted in
1988 and 1987. Still, it was the steepest increase since 1981, when
prices shot up 8.9 percent in a lingering aftershock from the
double-digit inflation of 1979 and 1980.
   Most economists expect inflation to hold steady or decline
slightly in 1990. The relatively low unemployment rate, at 5.3
percent in December, will keep wages rising and prevent a dramatic
improvement, they said.
   ``What it boils down to, ultimately, is a political judgment,''
said economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group, a Washington
consulting company. ``It's a trade-off between the degree of
inflation and the degree of unemployment.''
   The Labor Department said in another report that Americans'
inflation-adjusted earnings were unchanged in December after
falling 0.6 percent in November. Average weekly earnings were
$340.81 in December, up 3.2 percent from a year earlier but not
enough to keep up with the rise in prices.
   Food prices jumped 5.6 percent in 1989, the steepest in nine
years; December food costs were up a moderate 0.4 percent.
   Dairy products rose a sharp 2.2 percent in December, bringing
the increase for the year to 10.3 percent. The price of meat,
poultry fish and eggs rose 1 percent in December, with much of that
attributed to a 3.7 percent advance in egg prices, which climbed
35.4 percent for the year.
   Energy prices gained 5.1 percent last year, driven up by a 19.5
percent rise in fuel oil. Fuel oil increased 3.8 percent in
December and a congressional committee is investigating allegations
that oil companies used the cold weather as an excuse to grab
profits.
   Gasoline prices, which soared early in the year, fell in six of
the last seven months of 1989, including a 2 percent drop in
December. For the year, they were up 6.5 percent.
   Natural gas prices increased 2.1 percent last month, while
electricity rose 0.8 percent.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors,
considered by many analysts to be the best indicator of underlying
inflationary pressures in the economy, rose 0.4 percent in December
and 4.4 percent for the year, a drop from 4.7 percent in 1988.
   The cost of services, the category most heavily influenced by
wages, rose 0.4 percent in December and 5.1 percent for the year.
   New car prices rose 1 percent in December, but for the year were
up only 2.3 percent. The cost of medical care rose 0.5 percent last
month and 8.5 percent for the year.
   Clothing costs fell 0.7 percent in December, the result of
pre-Christmas reductions. For the year, they rose only 1 percent.
Tobacco prices were up 2 percent last month and 14.7 percent for
the year.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer
Price Index stood at 126.1 in December. That meant a hypothetical
selection of goods and services costing $100 in the 1982-84 base
period would have cost $126.10 last month, up from $120.50 a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Announces Lower Profits, Layoffs in Two States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. Thursday announced layoffs
affecting 1,200 workers in two states, citing a 34 percent decline
in fourth-quarter profits and a 19 percent decline for the year.
   Industry analysts said the announcement was not worrisome and
that Caterpillar remains in strong financial condition.
   ``Caterpillar competitively is in better shape than it's been in
in the last 15 years,'' said John Mackin, a machinery analyst for
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   For the fourth quarter, Caterpillar reported net earnings of
$107 million or $1.05 a share, down from $163 million or $1.61 per
share in the year-earlier period.
   The company blamed higher costs and smaller profits among its
affiliates for the dip in profits.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.76 billion from about $2.66
billion a year ago, due to higher prices and a $16 million rise in
its financial subsidiaries' revenues, the company said.
   Caterpillar, which had difficult times in the early 1980s but
made a strong comeback in the second half of the decade, makes and
markets large construction and earthmoving machinery.
   For the year, Caterpillar's after-tax profit fell to $497
million, from $616 million in 1988. Revenue rose 7 percent to
$11.13 billion from about $10.44 billion.
   Caterpillar, which employs more than 60,000 worldwide, said it
would place 200 employees in Aurora, Ill., and York, Pa., on
indefinite layoff.
   Another 1,000 workers, at Illinois facilities in Mapleton and
Mossville, would be idled by temporary shutdowns, the company said.
   ``Two-hundred (indefinite) layoffs is peanuts,'' said Alex
Blanton, a machinery analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in
New York. ``Frankly, they might be laying people off because
they're getting more efficient.''
   Caterpillar predicted Federal Reserve policy would ``push the
U.S. economy into a recession,'' which in turn would diminish sales
of some durable goods and equipment, but said it remained positive
about its outlook.
   ``We remain very optimistic overall about Caterpillar
opportunities in the '90s,'' said Caterpillar Chairman George
Schaefer.
   Merrill Lynch's Blanton said the company has not raised prices
sufficiently.
   ``The reason they aren't raising prices ... is that they are
scared to death there is going to be a recession. ... Therefore,
they are forecasting profits will remain under considerable
pressure for the rest of the year.''
   ``My feeling is, things are going to turn out a lot better than
they expect,'' Blanton said.

   Stock prices were widely mixed Thursday in a
volatile session marked by uneasiness over weak corporate earnings
and rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down nearly 20 points
at midsession, closed with a 7.25 gain at 2,666.38.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances, however, by about 3 to 2
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 584 up, 899 down and 495 unchanged.
   Analysts said blue chips benefited late in the day from buying
by professional traders engaged in multiple computer-program
strategies. But they described the overall news background as bleak.
   The market has been unsettled lately by a series of adverse
corporate earnings reports for the last three months of 1989.
   The latest came Thursday morning when Digital Equipment posted
earnings for its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 30 of $1.25 a share,
against $2.20 a share in the like period a year earlier.
   Digital's shares tumbled 5~ to 82 after a delayed opening.
   Selling continued, meanwhile in Aluminum Co. of America, down &rsqb;
at 66{ after the company reported lower quarterly profits on
Wednesday.
   At the same time, brokers said fears of a developing recession
were intensified by recent upward pressure on interest rates in
this country and in other leading industrialized countries.
   Rising rates in Japan, Germany and England are seen as a
deterrant to any move soon by the Federal Reserve to relax its
credit policy.
   Fed policymakers are believed to be concerned that lower rates
in the United States would prompt a flow of money out of American
credit markets into foreign securities with increasingly attractive
yields.
   That perception has helped push U.S. interest rates higher in
the past several days.
   U.S. Air fell 2 to 28}. The company described its operating
results for the fourth quarter as extremely disappointing, and said
it expected to post a loss for all of 1989.
   Gainers in the blue-chip sector included Philip Morris, up ~ at
39&rsqb;; General Electric, up | at 63|; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1 at 69{,
and DuPont, up ~ at 122{.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 178.59 million
shares, against 170.47 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 210.01 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.68 billion, or 0.05
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .21 to 187.07.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .83 to 388.82, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .79 at 338.19.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.16 to 437.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 366.17, down 1.89.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Jan 8., the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,214.8 billion from a revised $3,222.1 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,042.2 billion from a revised $4,046.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $793.5 billion from a revised $805.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.6 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.3 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,199.7 billion, a 7.5
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,029.9 billion, up 3.1 percent, while M1
rose 0.6 percent to an average of $792.4 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $197 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$136 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $299.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Jan. 10, up from $295.7 billion two weeks earlier.

   Assets of the nation's 488 money-market mutual
funds rose $5.29 billion in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to an all-time high of $381.11 billion in the
seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a $6.82 billion increase
in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 243 general purpose funds rose $1.85 billion to $126.66
billion, assets of 98 broker-dealer funds increased $1.41 billion
to $161.81 billion, and assets of 147 institutional funds rose
$2.03 billion to $92.65 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.74 percent from 7.80 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.88 percent from 7.92 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
38 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.32 percent as of Wednesday from 6.33 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.07 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.87
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.90
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.92 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.93 percent; 7.89 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and
7.91 percent on 5-year CDs, also unchanged.

<HEAD>Raytheon 4Q Earnings Climb 8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raytheon Co. said Thursday net profit
rose 8 percent in the fourth quarter, and a backlog of government
orders should protect it from looming cuts in defense spending.
   For the final three months of 1989, Raytheon earned $137
million, or $2.07 a share, compared with $127 million, or $1.92 a
share, a year ago. Sales edged up to $2.24 billion from $2.21
billion.
   Larry McCracken, a Raytheon spokesman, said the company was
encouraged by its backlog of orders, which will help ensure steady
earnings and sales gains.
   At year's end, the company's total backlog was a record $9.59
billion, including U.S. government orders of $6.97 billion.
   ``Entering the '90s, when defense budgets are under question,
it's comfortable to enter the year with record backlogs,''
McCracken said.
   For the year, Raytheon, which designs, engineers and
manufactures advanced electronic devices for both commercial and
government customers, earned $528.8 million, or $8.01 a share, up 8
percent from $489.6 million, or $7.35 a share, in 1988.
   Sales for the year totaled $8.79 billion, compared with $8.19
billion in 1988.
   Thomas Phillips, Raytheon chairman and chief executive, said in
a statement the company demonstrated its strength through diversity.
   The company had particularly strong growth in its aircraft
products segment, as pre-tax profits climbed 58 percent to $43.9
million.
   Raytheon said it had a decline in government aircraft sales, but
strong results from corporate and commuter airline customers.
   The company also recorded growth in its largest segment,
electronics, from $4.9 billion in sales in 1988 to $5.3 billion.
   That included a $274 million Navy contract for surveillance
radar systems and $231 million from the Air Force for satellite
communications terminals.
   Raytheon had 9 percent growth in its appliance sales, which
totaled $1.07 billion, thanks to improved profits from the
company's Amana and Speed Queen products.
   The company also said it had acquired 1.2 million of its own
shares under an ongoing plan authorized by the board of directors.
Raytheon has acquired 21.3 million company shares toward a goal of
25 million shares, and has about 66 million shares outstanding.

<TEXT>
   General Instrument Corp. on Thursday
introduced an updated descrambling device aimed at helping
satellite TV programmers protect their signals from pirates while
giving viewers the chance to receive more channels.
   Piracy has been a major problem for the backyard satellite dish
industry. General Instrument said its unit, called VideoCipher II
Plus, was designed to make it more difficult for electronic tinkers
to alter descramblers and receive signals from such services as
Home Box Office, ESPN, the Disney Channel, MTV and Showtime.
   The new descrambler also will make it possible to increase the
number of satellite channels offered to viewers, by raising from 56
to 256 the number of ``tier bits'' the devices can unscramble,
General Instrument said. Tier bits are the encrypted data codes
programmers use to secure their signals.
   The new system also expands to 50 million households the
potential satellite TV subscriber capacity, the company said after
showing the unit at a news conference in Alexandria, Va.
   Company spokesman Rick Griffin said the new unit will not add to
the cost of satellite dish systems, and existing dish owners still
may use their older descramblers.
   But Bob Phillips, chief executive officer of the
Washington-based National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative,
said the older models will become obsolete if and when programmers
decide to go beyond the current 56-bit capacity, which currently is
filled with signals.
   However, Phillips added that no programmers have announced plans
to expand to the higher tier-bit capacity.
   The unit is a second generation of the VideoCipher II
descrambling system, which is virtually the only descrambler
legally available to the nation's 2.7 million backyard satellite
dish owners.
   The older unit, which is being used by 50 satellite programmers,
has been criticized for being easily defeated by video pirates.
   ``There were too many pirates out there that were compromising
the system,'' Griffin said in a telephone interview. ``Now we have
an improved, more secure type of scrambling technology.''
   Phillips said General Instrument has sold 1.4 million to 1.6
million VideoCipher II units, but General Instrument has activated
only about 641,000 of them. The remainder of those sold presumably
have been altered to steal signals, Phillips said.
   ``There's a huge discrepancy there,'' he noted.
   The Federal Communications Commission, under orders from
Congress, is considering establishing an universal encryption
standard that would formally establish one type of descrambling
device.
   Phillips said his organization, which represents 550 rural
electric and rural telephone systems, thinks the FCC should
regulate General Instrument's VideoCipher technology since it is
the de facto standard in the industry.

<HEAD>Winter Storm Drives Wheat Futures Down, Cattle Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices dropped and cattle futures climbed Thursday
as an intense winter storm system muscled into the Southern Plains,
bringing badly needed moisture to the winter wheat crop and slowing
livestock marketings.
   On other commodity markets Thursday, orange juice futures fell
sharply; most energy futures rose; and precious metals retreated.
   Meteorologist Harvey Freese of Freese-Notis Weather Inc. in Des
Moines, Iowa, said the winter storm was likely to bring the largest
snowfall amounts in two years to the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles.
   Snow amounts of up to five inches were already reported in Texas
on Thursday afternoon and the precipitation was expected to
continue into Saturday, Freese said.
   Snow and rain was expected to spread over a wide area, including
western Kansas and western Nebraska, before the system pushes north
and east into the Midwest.
   The heavy downfall will help relieve the unusally dry conditions
that have prevailed in winter wheat country since late autumn.
   ``This is the biggest rain event since September,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   ``They are likely to get as much snow today, tonight and
tomorrow as they usually get in January or February,''
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 3\ cents lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade with the contract for delivery in March at $3.97} a
bushel, its lowest close since Sept. 28.
   Corn futures finished { cent to 1} cents higher with March at
$2.42 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1{ cents lower with March at
$1.38\ a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 3{ cents higher with
January at $5.60} a bushel.
   Expectations for a storm-related slowdown in cattle marketings
helped to boost live cattle futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where contracts for February and April delivery posted
new life-of-contract highs.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent to .58 cent higher with February at
78.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with January at 83.77 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with February at 49.60 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies finished 1.35 cents lower to .08 cent higher
with February at 55.52 cents a pound.
   Orange juice futures plunged on the New York Cotton Exchange
amid profit-taking by speculators who participated in the market's
spectacular 60 percent runup following the Christmas freeze in
Florida's citrus belt.
   ``It's about time we have a correction after a 75-cent move'' to
$2 a pound, said analyst Celeste Georkakis of Cargill Investor
Services Inc.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures finished 1.7 cents to
5.5 cents lower with January at $1.907 a pound.
   Petroleum futures ended mixed in volatile trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as crude and heating oil bounced back from
Wednesday's losses.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 66 cents
higher with February at $22.76 a barrel; heating oil was .56 cent
to 1.32 cents higher with February at 61.84 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .71 cent lower to .91 cent higher with
February at 60.71 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures sank on selling that analysts attributed
to abundant silver supplies and perceptions of an industrial
slowdown, which would reduce demand for silver in industrial
applications.
   Gold settled $1.80 to $2.50 lower with February at $411.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 5.4 cents to 6.8 cents lower with March at
$5.24 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Pfizer Blames 6 Percent Drop in 4th Qtr Net on Strong Dollar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer Inc. said Thursday the strength of the
dollar helped depress its net income by 5.9 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1989 despite a 9.2 percent increase in sales.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the pharmaceutical company's
net income fell to $133.3 million, or 79 cents a share, from $141.6
million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter sales rose to $1.49 billion from $1.37 billion.
   The dollar's strength against foreign currencies, increased
marketing expenses for new products and continued high research
spending contributed to an 8.1 percent decline in net income for
all of 1989, even though sales increased 5.3 percent, Pfizer said.
   ``Although these investment expenses will again be high in 1990,
the sales momentum of our new products is increasing,'' Chairman
Edmund T. Pratt Jr. said in a statement.
   Pratt said a new extended release version of Pfizer's Procardia
prescription drug for angina and hypertension tallied $40 million
in sales in just three months on the U.S. market. The company
expects to win U.S. regulatory approval this year to sell another
angina and hypertension drug, Norvasc, which it currently sells in
Britain and Ireland, he said.
   The dollar's strength reduced sales by two percentage points and
turned what would have been a modest growth in profits into a
decline, the company said.
   A strong dollar makes U.S. products more expensive, and
therefore less attractive, overseas.
   For the full year, net income fell to $727.3 million, or $4.31 a
share, from $791.3 million, or $4.70 a share.
   Full-year sales rose to $5.67 billion from $5.39 billion. If the
dollar hadn't risen in value last year, sales would have been three
percentage points higher and the profit decline would have been cut
in half, Pfizer said.
   The company's sales of pharmaceuticals increased 11 percent in
the latest year while sales of hospital products rose 3 percent.
Consumer products sales rose 12 percent, specialty chemicals sales
gained 6 percent and sales of animal health care products were up 9
percent.

   A state appellate judge ruled Thursday that
previously confidential material on the merger of two accounting
firms could be published.
   Judge George Bundy Smith invalidated the action earlier in the
day of state Supreme Court Justice Beatrice Shainswit who had
refused to lift her temporary restraining order forbidding Bowman's
Accounting Report from publishing how Ernst &amp; Young partners will
share profits and on other operations.
   Shainswit had said she would decide ``within a couple of days''
whether to allow Bowman's to publish. Lawyers for several media
immediately went to Smith's court and successfully sought repeal of
the order.
   The appellate judge's decision permits publication of the
material and allows other news organizations access to sealed
material, said Richard Winfield of Rogers &amp; Wells, representing The
Associated Press and other media.
   Ernst &amp; Young was formed last year after Ernst &amp; Whinney merged
with Arthur Young to become one of the largest accounting agencies
in the world. The merged company has sought to prevent the release
of the profit information, contending it contained trade secrets.
   The New York Times published some of the confidential
information Thursday. The Times said the material shows Ernst &amp;
Whinney partners take home roughly 65 percent of profits earned
jointly with Arthur Young for the next three years, while Arthur
Young's partners share the rest.
   Carl Liggio, lawyer for Ernst &amp; Young, conceded ``the cat is out
of the bag,'' but said the Times did not publish all of the
material, so continuing the restraining order was not meaningless.
   But Winfield and other media lawyers cited the Pentagon Papers
case as an example of a decision prohibiting prior restraint on
publication of a news story.
   ``The Times yesterday got a copy and yet there was this anomaly
of the Atlanta newsletter that was enjoined by an absolutely
invalid order,'' Winfield said.
   Keegan Federal, a lawyer for Bowman's, argued earlier in
Shainswit's court that such prior restraint is prohibited by the
First Amendment.
   Liggio admitted that the merger was a newsworthy event that
should be covered, but he said one could glean from the 30-odd
pages of leaked information trade secrets about how the firm
operates and makes decisions.
   The lawyer compared the accounting firm's material to Coca-Cola
Co.'s closely guarded soft-drink formula and Shainswit's personal
income tax returns. He argued that these were things that could be
restrained prior to publication.
   Liggio complained that Bowman's had started a media ``feeding
frenzy'' by passing word that it had been censored by Shainswit on
Jan. 8. The judge issued the order without letting Bowman's know
until after she had done it.
   Liggio asserted that Ernst &amp; Young was entitled to ``recapture''
that material, which he said had been prepared for the eyes of
partners only and which he suggested had been obtained illegally by
news media.
   ``How are you going to recapture it from The Times,'' Shainswit
asked.
   Liggio acknowledged there was nothing preventing the Times from
publishing the rest of the material, which would make the court
order moot.
   Federal, who also referred to the newsworthiness of the merger,
noted that Ernst &amp; Young, which has thousands of clients and
operates worldwide, issued numerous press releases containing
revenue information.
   ``The public has an interest in knowing whether those press
releases were true or false,'' Federal said.
   Winfield of Rogers &amp; Wells submitted briefs and asked Shainswit
to unseal court records in the case.
   ``The news organizations represented before you this morning
have more than a general interest that there be no order upholding
prior restraint in New York state,'' Winfield said.
   Shainswit had said she would rule on unsealing the records when
she rules on the temporary restraining order.
   The Times account said the confidential documents showed Ernst &amp;
Whinney was by far the stronger of the two firms and its partners
historically out-earned their peers at Arthur Young.
   The Times did not explain how it got a copy of the documents,
which also were leaked to Accounting Today, a twice-monthly
newsletter based in New York. Bowman's Accounting Report is barred
from talking about the case.
   Editor Robert Crane of Accounting Today said Wednesday he plans
to publish the material in its Feb. 5 edition, which is to mailed
to subscribers Jan. 30.
   The news organizations, who joined Bowman's in charging that
Shainswit's order was an unconstitutional abridgement of press
freedom, include:
   The Associated Press, New York Times, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Wall Street Journal, the Newsletter
Association, the New York Daily News, Newsday, American Lawyer, the
Society of Professional Journalists.
   Also submitting a friend of the court brief on behalf of
Bowman's was the New York Civil Liberties Union.

<HEAD>New Real Estate Appraisals Guidelines Issued</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Thursday issued new
guidelines designed to raise the quality of real estate appraisals,
a factor often cited as one of the causes of the savings and loan
crisis.
   Under the S&amp;L law passed last summer, states must license and
certify their appraisers by July 1, 1991. If the states do not come
up with a satisfactory plan, their appraisers can be frozen out of
working on many transactions financed by federally insured banks,
savings institutions and credit unions.
   Faulty appraisals that overvalued commercial properties are
viewed as one of the chief contributors to bad loans that caused
billions of dollars of S&amp;L losses. Appraisers are supposed to
independently value a property being sold, but can be influenced by
lenders and real estate agents, on whom they depend for business,
critics say.
   A subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council, which coordinates standards among five federal regulatory
agencies, issued guidelines, effective in 60 days, which tell the
states how to set up their certification process.
   The rules encourage states to establish an independent
regulatory agency, answerable to the governor or a cabinet-level
officer, to regulate appraisals. The agency should be insulated
from the banking and real estate industries, which may have
conflicting interests.
   If budget constraints force a state to put appraisal regulation
in the same office that governs real estate brokers, different
officials should make the decisions on whether to license,
de-license or discipline an appraiser, the council said.
   Appraisers in states that have systems already meeting the new
standards will not have to undergo recertification, but appraisers
in other states will.
   ``What we're trying to do is gain some consistency and integrity
in the system,'' said Kevin Blakely, a deputy director of the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and chairman of the
appraisal subcommittee.
   Norman Flynn, president of the National Association of Realtors,
praised the guidelines but said they should have been issued four
or five months ago. He said states will be hard-pressed to get
their systems ready to certify appraisers in time to meet the
deadline.
   ``We're afraid the consumer is going to be standing in long
lines trying to get an appraisal done. That's not good business,''
he said.
   Blakely said the deadline provides ``quite a bit of leadtime''
and said the law gives regulators power to extend the deadline to
the end of 1991 if a state is making progress.

<HEAD>CIGNA Agrees to Pay $777 Million For EQUICOR</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial services giant CIGNA Corp. said
Thursday it has agreed to pay $777 million in cash for
EQUICOR-Equitable HCA Corp. in a deal that may make it the nation's
largest group indemnity insurance company.
   EQUICOR, based in Nashville, Tenn., is a group insurance and
managed health care joint venture owned by The Equitable Life
Assurance Society of the United States and Hospital Corporation of
America.
   Wilson H. Taylor, chairman and chief executive of
Philadelphia-based CIGNA, announced the agreement, which is subject
to federal review.
   As a result of the review, Taylor said he does not expect the
deal to be finalized for several months. He said the purchase price
would come from ``within corporate resources.''
   Taylor, speaking in a conference call with reporters, said
EQUICOR has a ``strong group insurance presence'' and a client list
which includes a ``number of large Fortune 500-type accounts.''
   Based on 1988 figures, EQUICOR ranks sixth in the nation and
CIGNA ranks fifth in terms of premiums and premium equivalents, or
revenue, in life and health insurance, Taylor said. Together, he
said, the companies would be the largest in the country with more
than 12 million participants.
   Taylor said EQUICOR's strength in the Health Maintenance
Organization market was also a significant factor in the deal. Its
450,000 enrollees in 19 cities combines with CIGNA's 1.5 million
enrollees in 31 cities to bring the total to almost two million, he
said. Ten of the 19 cities covered by EQUICOR are not currently
served by CIGNA, according to Taylor.
   He said ``size and scale are critical'' for success in the
insurance business. The merger of these two companies, according to
Taylor, will benefit both customers and shareholders.
   There will be ``some reduction in the workforce,'' Taylor said,
but he refused to speculate on locations or numbers.
   Michael J. Monroe, CIGNA vice president, said antitrust laws
prevent those types of decisions until the deal is closed.
   In 1988, CIGNA's Employee Life and Health Benefits segment had
premium and premium equivalents of $8 billion and after tax profits
of $43 million, while EQUICOR had more than $5 billion of premium
and premium equivalents and $16 million of after-tax profits, CIGNA
said.
   For the first nine months of 1989, CIGNA's EL&amp;HB segment
reported $120 million of after-tax profits and EQUICOR had
approximately $30 million, both representing significant
improvement from the first nine months of 1988, according to CIGNA.
   The CIGNA companies, with 1988 net income of $458 million and
assets of $56 billion, are worldwide providers of insurance and
related financial services products, including health care,
pension-retirement benefits, investment management,
property-casualty and life insurance.

<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. said Thursday its
net income fell 11 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 29, 1989,
largely because of expenses stemming from cost-reduction programs
and damages from the Bay area earthquake.
   Net income fell 11 percent to $124.8 million in the company's
fiscal first quarter from $140.5 million a year earlier. Earnings
per share fell 13 percent to 96 cents from $1.10.
   The cost-reduction programs and earthquake expenses reduced net
income by $20.5 million or 16 cents a share.
   Revenues rose 6 percent to $1.49 billion from $1.41 billion.
   ``The modest year-over-year growth in revenues reflects diverse
growth rates of our various products,'' said John Sculley, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Sales to consumers of the Macintosh Plus and Apple II computers
declined in the latest quarter, he said, but sales to the business
market of new products, including the Macintosh IIcx and SE@30,
``increased significantly.''
   Recent cost-cutting measures announced by the company, including
some job reductions and the elimination of company cars, ``will
bring expense growth in better line with revenue growth as we
progress through this fiscal year,'' Scully said.
   International sales accounted for 36 percent of total revenues,
compared to 32 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 1989.

   Motorola Inc. reported Thursday that its
fourth-quarter profit jumped 21 percent, while both sales and
earnings posted records for all of last year.
   The electronics company said it earned $132 million, or $1.01 a
share, for the fourth quarter of 1989, compared with $124 million,
or 95 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
   Fourth-quarter sales totaled $2.65 billion, up 21 percent from
$2.19 billion in the final quarter of 1988.
   For the year, earnings rose to $498 million, or $3.83 a share,
from $445 million, or $3.43 a share, a year earlier, Motorola said.
   Sales for 1989 increased 17 percent to $9.6 billion from $8.3
billion in 1988.
   ``The cellular telephone market continues to expand rapidly,''
said George Fisher, chairman and chief excutive officer.
   ``Overall, the communications arena promises to be one of the
major growth opportunities of the 1990s, as we develop new ways to
serrve the needs of our customers on the move.''
   In addition to mobile phones, Motorola makes computer chips,
two-way radio systems and other computer-related products.

<TEXT>
   Bankruptcy court filings by Campeau Corp.'s
retailers threaten pensions worth as much as $10 million for
retired executives, the company says.
   The 525 affected executives make up less than 2 percent of the
25,000 retirees from Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. Many of them worked for Federated before 1953, when
current pension plans were established.
   Another 25 signed individual employment agreements, according to
court filings. Retirees who signed such agreements typically earned
$100,000 to $1 million annually.
   ``Those things are not protected in a trust because they were
individually negotiated and payments stop in a Chapter 11,'' said
Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Allied and Federated.
   Federated and Allied filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Monday, citing $7.7 billion in debts, much of it
stemming from Robert Campeau's purchase of the chains.
   ``It seems somehow wrong that people who worked hard for many
years are now victims of Mr. Campeau's takeover,'' said former
Federated vice president James Selonick, who said he stands to lose
tens of thousands of dollars.
   ``Our money, which is a good many million dollars, is being used
to bail out Federated, and I think that's unreasonable,'' he said.
   Ms. Sanger said other pensions, life insurance and medical
benefits paid by Federated are protected in the bankruptcy
proceedings.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains, Stocks Fall in Tokyo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Nikkei morning close, comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen
Friday morning while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
continued to decline moderately.
   The dollar was quoted late in the morning at 146.42 yen, near
the top of the morning's range and up from 145.66 at the Tokyo
close Thursday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which slipped
91.68 yen on Thursday, fell another 154.74 yen, or 0.42 percent, to
finish the morning session at 36,574.72.
   A currency dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said market sentiment
for the dollar remains bullish following its overnight rise in New
York after two officials from the U.S. Federal Reserve were quoted
as saying the central bank would not cut interest rates any time
soon.
   Manuel Johnson, a Fed vice chairman, and Wayne Angell, a Fed
governor, told The Wall Street Journal they would not support
easier short-term U.S. interest rates unless economic conditions
changed. Higher interest rates tend to support a country's currency.
   There were reports that the Bank of Japan sold dollars in the
Sydney market earlier in the morning, but the central bank hadn't
been spotted in Tokyo.
   ``The Bank of Japan will intervene, but they won't have much
impact on the market. It'll be difficult to push the dollar down
when market sentiment is so bullish,'' said one trader at a major
Japanese trust bank.
   Securities dealers said the yen's decline depressed the Nikkei
index.
   The sudden surge of selling had an exaggerated effect on the
market indices because trading was thin, said a dealer at Nikko
Securities Co, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>First Boston Reportedly Removes Chief Executive; Link to Campeau</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Boston Corp. has removed William E. Mayer
as its chief executive and named him head of a new subsidiary that
will monitor the firm's investment in Campeau Corp.'s troubled
retailing divisions, according to a newspaper report.
   The investment bank was listed as the largest unsecured creditor
of Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp. in the companies' Chapter 11 filing for bankruptcy court
protection Monday.
   First Boston's exposure to the store groups was listed at $526
million. But the firm says its actual investment is more than $100
million below that figure, and that because it has taken some
losses on its books already, the maximum amount it has at risk is
$293 million, The New York Times reported in Friday's editions.
   Mayer will head a new subsidiary called CS First Boston Merchant
Bank, the Times reported. The unit will manage the firm's
investments in 29 companies as well as the Federated and Allied
exposure, which was largely the result of a temporary loan the firm
made to Campeau to help fund its takeover of Federated, the
newspaper said.
   John M. Hennessy, chief executive of First Boston's holding
company, CS First Boston, will replace Mayer as head of the
investment bank.
   ``There is no question that Campeau needs a lot of attention,''
the Times quoted an unidentified First Boston spokesman as saying.
   But the spokesman said Hennessy and Mayer had found no need to
have a different chief executive for the holding company and the
operating subsidiary. ``They were falling over each other,'' the
spokesman was quoted as saying.
   The Times quoted unidentified former First Boston executives as
saying Mayer was being made a scapegoat because the firm's problems
with Campeau went beyond the Federated and Allied situation.
Hennessy had been wanting to tighten his control over the firm for
some time, the newspaper quoted the executives as saying.
   First Boston could not be reached for comment on the Times
report. A call to its main number after business hours went
unanswered.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumors on Wall Street that heavily indebted
publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. would file for bankruptcy
sent HBJ stock plummeting Thursday and prompted a rare company
denial.
   HBJ ``is not a candidate for Chapter 11'' bankruptcy protection,
William Jovanovich, the company's reclusive chairman, said in a
statement released after the market closed.
   Jovanovich made his statement to the Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report, a New York news service, after the Orlando-based
company sought to calm market jitters with another statement early
in the afternoon.
   The bankruptcy rumors, Jovanovich said, came in response to the
publicized problems of other indebted companies, an apparent
reference to bankruptcy filings Monday by Campeau Corp.'s Allied
Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Huge sales of HBJ stock early in the day fueled speculation
surrounding the publisher.
   HBJ stock, which traded at nearly $10 a share just three months
ago, traded as low as $2 before finishing 12{ cents down at $2.875,
a record low.
   Volume totalled 4.8 million shares, making it the most active
issue on the New York Stock Exchange.
   After the stock hit its low point, the company issued its first
statement saying that operating income and cash flow in 1990 would
be ``significantly higher'' than what HBJ will post for 1989.
   HBJ is not due to release 1989 earnings until February or March.
In 1988, the company posted a loss of $126.5 million because of
high interest payments associated with its debt.
   On Monday, Allied and Federated filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act, largely because of
billions of dollars of debt stemming from the acquisition of the
companies by Canada's Campeau Corp. in recent years.
   HBJ has about $1.6 billion of junk bonds outstanding. The
company borrowed nearly $3 billion as part of a frantic
recapitalization 2{ years ago to repell a hostile takeover bid by
British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   Last year, HBJ sold its six theme parks to Anheuser-Busch Cos.
Inc. for $1.1 billion in an effort to pare its debt. The
attractions included the Sea World parks in Orlando; San Antonio,
Texas; San Diego; and Aurora, Ohio; Boardwalk and Baseball near
Haines City and Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven.
   Ivan Obolensky, an analyst who follows HBJ for the Josephthal &amp;
Co. brokerage, told the Sentinel he didn't believe the publisher
was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy.
   Neither did Douglas Evan Schimmel, a New York money manager.
   ``Things would have to get a lot worse for the company to file
bankruptcy,'' Schimmel said.

<HEAD>PNC Earnings Drop 98 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profit at PNC Financial Corp., the country's
13th largest bank holding company, dropped 98 percent in the fourth
quarter last year as the bank set aside more money to cover
potentially bad loans to Third World countries, the company said
Wednesday.
   Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial, which owns banks in Kentucky,
New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania, posted net income of $1.47
million in the final three months of 1989. For the same period in
1988, the bank earned $119.11 million, or $1.28 per share.
   Earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 1989 were
nearly zero because the dividend paid to holders of preferred stock
totaled $1.1 million, or nearly all the bank's profit, said Walter
Gregg, executive vice president for finance.
   The bank normally sets aside about $40 million each quarter to
cover potentially bad loans, but it increased that amount to
$217.67 million in the fourth quarter.
   About $100 million of the money will go toward protecting the
bank from medium- and long-term loans to less-developed countries,
the bank said.
   With the move, the bank has set aside enough money to cover
$191.2 million in medium- and long-term loans and half the $56
million it has made in short-term loans to less developed
countries, it said.
   The bank also set aside $80 million for potentially bad domestic
loans. Gregg said the move was designed to bring PNC back in line
with reserving more than 100 percent of outstanding loans. The bank
has set aside about 126 percent of the total amount it is owed, he
said.
   For the year, PNC's profits dropped 18 percent to $377.44
million, or $3.98 per share, from $460.43 million, or $4.98 per
share, in 1988.

   Sam Walton, founder of the Wal-Mart
discount chain, has undergone chemotherapy and radiation treatment
for a malignant bone marrow disease, Walton said in a memo
distributed Wednesday to Wal-Mart employees.
   In the two-page memo, Walton, 71, said he had been undergoing
treatment at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston for multiple
myeloma, which he described as a bone disease. Myeloma is a
malignant tumor of the bone marrow, consisting generally of
abnormal plasma cells.
   Since Sunday, Walton said, he had undergone two chemotherapy
treatments and radiation treatment. Don Shinkle, a Wal-Mart Stores
spokesman, said Walton wrote in the memo that he feels much better
after experiencing aches and pains the past several months.
   Shortly after noon Wednesday, Walton visited one of the
company's stores, a Sam's Wholesale Club, in Houston, Shinkle said.
   According to Shinkle, Walton said in the memo that he may be
slowed down for a few weeks, but that he expects to resume visiting
other stores in a few weeks.
   ``Along with Mr. Sam's doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the company said in a statement released by Shinkle
from corporate headquarters here.
   Walton's memo outlined Wal-Mart accomplishments during the
1980s, said the employees were responsible for those
accomplishments and that he looked forward to more success.
   Shinkle declined to provide a copy of the memo, saying it was
personal.
