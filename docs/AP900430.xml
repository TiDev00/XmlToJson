   Thirteen people were hospitalized in
this seaside resort after getting caught in the crush of thousands
of young fans trying to get into a sold-out concert by the U.S. pop
group New Kids on the Block.
   More than 8,500 people had arrived for Sunday night's concert,
which was held in a 5,100-seat hall.
   East Sussex ambulance service in Brighton, 50 miles south of
London, said it treated more than 350 people, mostly teen-age
girls, for hysteria and hyperventilation.
   Thirteen were taken to a hospital with breathing difficulties,
abdominal pains, back injuries or heat exhaustion, officials said.
   Fans began collapsing as they stood in line hours before the
start of the concert. Ambulance crews and Red Cross volunteers set
up temporary first aid stations the hall.
   A similar scene occurred Saturday night at a concert by the
group in coastal Whitley Bay, 280 miles north of London, with first
aid being administered to more than 400 fans.

   Thousands of pelicans have died of
starvation as an oasis in Australia's harsh outback country begins
to dry up, killing fish the birds feed on, officials say.
   It is unclear how many birds have died, but the carcasses of
thousands of adult birds and their chicks can be seen covering two
islands in Lake Eyre in the northern part of South Australia state.
   The area is also dotted with unhatched eggs.
   Scientist say adult pelicans have been spotted flying up to 220
miles a day in search of food.
   An estimated 200,000 pelicans made their homes at Lake Eyre, a
more than 100-mile-long body of water, after the oasis' waters
swelled following heavy rains in October.
   But drought followed the heavy rainfall, increasing the salinity
of the lake. That killed large numbers of fish the pelicans eat,
causing starvation among the birds.
   Many pelicans have already left the area, but few of the chicks
were expected to survive, said Kim Lowe, national co-ordinator of
the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service's
bird-monitoring unit.
   Lowe said he was could not explain why the pelicans chose to
nest at Lake Eyre, 500 miles north of their nearest breeding ground.
   ``It is an amazing phenomenon,'' he said. ``It is very humbling
to think we haven't got a basic idea why they would do this sort of
thing.''

<HEAD>Police Say Tree Thieves Coming out of Woodwork</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In this caper, a bark won't scare intruders away
but actually encourages them to commit crimes. Police say tree
thieves are coming out of the woodwork.
   Thefts from private lawns and nurseries this year include 230
rosebushes, four Japanese yews and four bonsai trees, and dozens of
evergreens, especially small, ornamental ones, police said.
   The thieves even steal lawns, rolling up the sod.
   The stolen property can crop up anywhere _ in the thief's
manicured garden, for example, or in fly-by-night nurseries. Some
of it might be going to chop shops that graft and sell stolen
trees, shrubs and plants.
   The perennial problem appears rooted in Chicago, particularly on
the South Side, and sprouts on spring nights when yards have been
freshly landscaped and the ground is soft. Apart from Christmas
tree heists, nothing like it occurs in New York, Los Angeles and
Detroit, authorities there said.
   ``I don't think we've got the lawns or trees worth stealing
here,'' joked Detroit police Sgt. William Pendergast.
   But Jim Hirst, a Chicago property crimes detective, isn't
laughing. About 80 trees, plants and lawns vanished overnight in
the city last year.
   Dorothy Hicks said her husband, William, woke one morning to
find a hole where their beloved 2-year-old juniper tree once stood.
   ``I went outside, and sure enough it was gone,'' she said last
week. The thieves ``must have kept shaking and shaking it and
pulling and pulling. I could see track marks where it had been
(dragged) across my sidewalk.''
   The little tree, trimmed to appear as if it had four pompons,
was worth almost $80, she said. She doesn't think she'll ever see
it again.
   Another juniper almost met a similar fate.
   ``One more pull, and they would have gotten it. They just left
it ... slumping over,'' she said.
   Aside from putting lead on the trees to hold them down, Mrs.
Hicks doesn't know what to do to protect her garden. ``I paid
enough putting a burglar alarm in the house,'' she said.
   Hirst said it is almost impossible to catch the thieves.
   One break came April 1 when a witness spotted a van parked in an
alley shortly after a tree theft occurred at Long's Garden Center.
Police searched the van and found $2,100 in evergreens.
   The driver was charged with ``grand theft tree,'' and the
passenger with simple theft.
   The thieves probably use the trees in their own lawns or sell
them to unwitting buyers or to fly-by-night nurseries, Hirst said.
Hirst said he ``wouldn't put it past'' them to set up chop shops to
sell the parts.
   The prospects of ending this crime, Hirst said, are not good.
   ``You put up a fence, they steal the fence,'' he said. ``After
the fence thief comes and steals your fence, then your tree thief
steals the tree.''

   Women will saddle up in June to
participate for the first time in a horseback ride from California
to Missouri that is held each year to commemorate the Pony Express.
   The trip along the route of the Old West mail service is
organized by the National Pony Express Association, which refused
to allow women to ride until female enthusiasts threatened a
lawsuit.
   ``The reason was that we are an historical organization,'' said
Ken Martin, national president of the group founded in the 1970s in
California.
   ``Young, skinny wiry fellows carried the mail for the Pony
Express back in 1860 and 1861, and we try to be as authentic as
possible. There were no women Pony Express riders,'' he said last
week.
   Wome who paid the association's annual $10 national dues scoffed
at the claim of authenticity, pointing out that many of the riders
are portly men over age 50 who drive pickup trucks to their
assigned positions on the trail.
   Helping bring the matter to a head last fall was Melba J. Leal,
a member of the group's California chapter since 1985. She
threatened discrimination lawsuits if she and another woman, Edie
McElwee, were not allowed to ride.
   Leal was angered by a new twist to the event _ riders overseas
on a route through Czechoslovakia, Austria and East Germany.
   ``Edie and I found it inconceivable that women, as full members
and citizens of the United States, are not allowed the same
privileges,'' Leal said.
   On April 3, 1860, the legendary Pony Express began service
between St. Joseph and Sacramento, Calif. The service gave way to
the transcontinental telegraph.
   People pay to have the association's riders carry special
letters that include history and information on the Pony Express on
the 10-day commemorative trip through Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska,
Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and California.
   The cost is $5 per letter.
   The mail will leave Sacramento on June 8 and arrive in St.
Joseph on June 17, with participants posted along the way. After
the mail reaches St. Joseph, it will be flown to Europe for the
trip there.
   The organization's national board decided last fall to let the
state chapters decide whether women should be allowed to ride.
   ``The state chapters have voted to condone women to ride,''
Martin said. ``We will have women riders in California and Nevada,
and perhaps some other states.''

   Lucie Arnaz says her mother, Lucille Ball, kept
her television on almost all the time but preferred game shows to
situation comedies.
   ``I don't think she liked sitcoms very much in general after a
while,'' Arnaz said in the May 7 issue of People magazine. ``But
she did like to watch `Wheel of Fortune.' Every night. Whenever we
were eating dinner it was always on. I guess that's a sitcom in
itself.''
   Miss Ball died in April 1989.
   Arnaz is the host for Monday night's airing on CBS of the
34-minute pilot of ``I Love Lucy,'' taped in March 1951 and never
before seen on television.
   ``I thought maybe the pilot would make me cry or something, but
I just laughed,'' she said.

   Wynn said Sunday that he and Jackson plan to build a mountain
resembling Hawaii's Diamond Head peak between the hotel and
Interstate 15 at a cost of up to $15 million.
   The project will include two swimming pools, a dolphin lagoon, a
water slide and plush villas reserved for the casino's
high-rollers, Wynn said. It is scheduled to open in September.

   Oprah Winfrey says she hopes her new TV
drama, ``The Women of Brewster Place,'' will help dispel
stereotypes of blacks.
   ``I want to see black people in terms of what is real, not what
is stereotypical and manufactured, and I think the series will help
other people, the rest of the country, to see black people in a
different light _ to see them having feelings, being responsible
for their children, caring about each other,'' the actress and talk
show host said of the series that airs Tuesday on ABC.
   Miss Winfrey, a Nashville native, discussed the series at her
Harpo Inc. studio last month.
   The series is based on the 1989 miniseries ``The Women of
Brewster Place,'' which was based on a novel by Gloria Naylor.

She's a very private person.''
   Their son, Marston Glenn, was born April 9.
   Hefner does not think his family-man image will hurt business.

   Eastern Illinois University is honoring
one of its dropouts, folk singer Burl Ives.
   The university named an art studio after the 81-year-old folk
singer and actor, who enrolled at the college in 1929 but dropped
out in his third year as his grades slipped.
   Ives said it felt good to be back at Eastern, despite not having
a degree. He said he hoped that people who use the building will
follow his example and go where their creativity takes them.
   After leaving college, Ives' wanderings as a hobo and as a
troubadour took him through 46 states, and he memorized some 500
folk songs.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Early Budget Debate is Big on `Straw Men'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every year Rep. William Dannemeyer offers his
budget to the House and every year it gets crushed. Last week, it
was 354-48.
   ``You'd think that pride would dictate that he'd give up the
folly,'' said Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., the chairman of the House
Rules Committee which gave the California Republican permission to
offer his plan.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington says Dannemeyer gets
to propose his budget to the House, while others are denied,
because the Republicans want it and it is a genuine alternative to
the Democratic offering.
   But when Democrats gave Dannemeyer a vote on his plan during the
tightly constrained budget debate it wasn't because they were
feeling a strong sense of democracy.
   His proposal is one of the straw men. The majority sets them up
to get knocked down. It makes their own proposals look more
moderate, more mighty. And they give cover for blocking
consideration of alternatives which might put House members on the
spot.
   Dannemeyer, better known for his radical anti-homosexual views,
has a dream of returning the government to the gold standard.
   Now that the federal debt is $3 trillion, huge sums would be
saved if somehow its interest costs could be reduced. Annual
deficits would shrink away.
   So instead of relying on such traditional budget-balancing
techniques as raising revenue and cutting programs, Dannemeyer
proposes the government issue gold-backed bonds and refinance the
national debt.
   Only a handful, mostly the most conservative members of the
House, give such talk any credence.
   The budget proposed by the Congressional Black Caucus is as far
to the left as Dannemeyer's is to the right. It too always fails.
The House leadership is pleased to see it debated and then put
aside for another year.
   The Democrats will also let the Republicans offer President
Bush's original budget _ which even the administration now concedes
is hopelessly out of date.
   Each package is voted up or down, take it or leave it.
   But if a lawmaker wants to change a small part of the budget to,
for example, shift money from defense to education, that's not
allowed. The rules are drawn so tightly that no amendments are
permitted _ only complete substitutes cleared by the Rules
Committee.
   There's no debate and vote on the proposal by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut Social Security taxes. The
Democratic National Committee has endorsed the proposal but House
leaders have found it too hot to handle.
   The sweeping deficit reduction package by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., is also missing from the schedule. With tax increases and
Social Security cuts, it might force lawmakers to make
uncomfortable choices.
   The only votes House members make will be on those substitutes,
the straw men. Which, by the time a final vote comes this week on
the Democrats' $1.2 trillion fiscal 1991 budget, will allow the
party leadership to claim that the House considered and voted on a
range of views.
   The desired result is to make the Democratic budget the easy
choice, the sound alternative. The Democrats last week were
confidently predicting victory.
   But what kind of victory is earned this way?
   ``Let us not have any illusions that we are voting on truth and
virtue here,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., senior Republican
on the House Budget Committee. ``We are voting on one tiny step
which will move us toward the final compromise.''
   ``Obviously more is going to be expected of this House and of
this Congress.''
   More may be expected. But there's no evidence yet that more will
be provided.

<HEAD>Republicans Turn to Well-Known Mayor to Try to Revive Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indiana Republicans, dispirited and in
disarray after losing the governor's office for the first time in
two decades, believe Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut could
help lead a party revival.
   The four-term mayor, often credited with engineering the
revitalization of Indiana's largest city, is running for secretary
of state. The job pays almost $29,000 less than the mayor's office
and has only a fraction of the responsibility.
   But the political payoff could be significant, Republicans
believe, if Hudnut defeats incumbent Democrat Joseph H. Hogsett and
helps the GOP gain control of the state Legislature for the
important redistricting session of 1991.
   A Hudnut victory this year also could put the mayor in line to
challenge Gov. Evan Bayh in 1992, many believe. The first-term
Democratic governor used the secretary of state's race in 1986 as a
springboard for his gubernatorial campaign two years later.
   ``I think the party that wins this year, particularly in terms
of the legislative races, will control the political landscape for
the rest of this decade,'' said Hudnut, 57.
   Party leaders believe Hudnut, who entered the race in early
February, already has helped the party's fund-raising, boosted
morale and helped recruit legislative candidates.
   ``The Hudnut candidacy has added a spirit of enthusiasm across
the board,'' said state GOP Chairman Keith Luse.
   That enthusiasm was missing after Bayh defeated Lt. Gov. John M.
Mutz in 1988, bringing an end to 20 years of GOP rule at the
Statehouse. Republicans elected and then rejected one state
chairman, other candidates for secretary of state failed to fire up
the troops, and appointed Sen. Dan Coats spent thousands of dollars
trying to boost his name recognition to a level Hudnut already
enjoys upon entering statewide politics.
   ``I think the Republican Party since 1988 was wallowing around a
little bit and sort of licking its wounds and was kind of
dispirited,'' said Hudnut, a former Presbyterian minister.
   ``One of the strengths I hope I bring to this effort is the
ability to galvanize the troops, to make them feel as though what
they're doing is important, to make them feel as though 1988 is
behind us and we're moving ahead now.''
   That the party turned to Hudnut is ironic in light of his past
relationship with the GOP hierarchy, which quashed a draft-Hudnut
movement before the 1988 governor's race.
   Hudnut maintains he's long been popular with the party's rank
and file, a view confirmed by Luse who said party functions have
been filled to capacity since the mayor entered the secretary of
state's race.
   That popularity could help the entire ticket. And more
important, Hudnut gives the party a charismatic leader who could
turn the 1990 election into a referendum on Bayh's administration
and pose a direct threat to Bayh's re-election plans, some leaders
believe.
   Hudnut says ``you never say never,'' when asked if he wants
someday to run for governor. He said he can't afford to look ahead
to 1992 because he considers himself an underdog against a
well-financed Hogsett campaign.
   Hogsett, a 33-year-old attorney who managed Bayh's two statewide
campaigns, also claims he's the underdog because Hudnut begins the
race with a sizeable name recognition advantage. Appointed
secretary of state when Bayh became governor, Hogsett has never
before run for office.
   Although the two candidates won't be formally nominated until
their parties' state conventions in June, Hudnut and Hogsett
already are touring the state regularly to take swipes at each
other.
   Hogsett takes the mayor to task for 19 tax increases and
creation of eight new taxes during his tenure. Hudnut says Hogsett
shows ``a lack of experience, a lack of governmental competence''
in leveling charges about financial matters the mayor claims his
opponent doesn't understand.
   Hudnut also has been on the defensive in recent weeks trying to
explain why he visited a psychic for marital counseling before he
and his second wife were divorced in 1988.
   Hudnut calls the matter personal and says he doesn't see any
conflict between his religious training and the psychic's beliefs
in astrology and reincarnation.

<HEAD>Criticism of Japan Seen as Growing Political Issue</HEAD>

   Richard Gephardt thinks maybe he was a little
ahead of the curve on Japan.
   During the 1988 presidential campaign, people accused him of
bashing Japan on its trade policies. They called him a
protectionist.
   Today, however, he says a lot more people are in his camp,
particularly Democrats who sense a good issue for 1992.
   ``There is a greater understanding on the part of a lot of
people, especially about our problems with Japan and a few of the
other countries where there are really significant trade access
problems,'' said the Missouri Democratic congressman.
   President Bush is receiving near-record high approval ratings in
opinion polls, but some analysts believe U.S. trade problems with
Japan could emerge as an issue against the Republican president in
1992.
   ``It's the biggest long-term danger to the Bush
administration,'' said Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg.
   When Bush announced Friday he was removing Japan from the ``hit
list'' of countries judged by the administration to have the most
offensive trade barriers against American products, members of
Congress were quick to protest.
   ``It is clear that Japan should be on the list,'' said Sen.
Donald Riegle, D-Mich. ``Our government is not using the tools that
are available to correct this continuing hemorrhage of U.S. capital
and jobs.''
   ``Trade access problems.'' That's the polite term used by people
upset by the $49 billion deficit in the U.S. trade balance with
Japan. Some Americans feeling the heat of competition with Japan
are apt to be less polite.
   For example, try the radio ad run by a suburban Washington auto
dealer.
   In an accent distinctly Japanese, a man is heard admiring an
American car at a fictitious Tokyo auto show.
   An incredulous American voice asks: ``Haven't you ever seen a
Safford Lincoln Continental before?''
   ``Only in magazines,'' is the reply. ``Japanese have too many
import restrictions and taxes to see one in person.''
   ``I wouldn't phrase it as Japan bashing, obviously,'' said Sen.
John Breaux of Louisiana, chairman of the Senate Democratic
Campaign Committee. ``But I think it is a very legitimate issue.
People in the hinterlands and middle America are feeling we are
giving away our technology.''
   ``There is a frustration Americans feel over not controlling
their own destiny,'' said Michael McCurry, communications director
of the Democratic National Committee.
   But McCurry and other politicians questioned the long-term value
of simply decrying Japan's trade practices.
   ``Bashing Japan gets you the audience,'' said the DNC official.
``But you have to make a pretty sophisticated argument about what
you would do.''
   Ohio is one of the states where people feel hardest hit by
competition from Japan. Jim Ruvolo, the state's Democratic Party
chairman, recalled that during the 1988 presidential campaign, the
Ohio party produced and ran a television spot that directly
attacked Japanese trade practices.
   When that ad ran, Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis gained six points in the state.
   Frank Greer, a Democratic political consultant, said that among
many Americans there is ``anxiety we are slipping behind.'' But he
said people are as likely to blame American management practices as
they are to point to Japanese trade policies.
   ``The Japan bashing, I don't think you can tell yet,'' said Bob
Teeter, a Republican pollster and adviser to Bush. ``I think it's
one of those things that has the potential on the surface to work
for you and under the surface to backfire.''
   Greenberg, the Democratic pollster, has examined attitudes
toward Japan and said, ``I don't think out-and-out bashing works
any more. You can run on putting our own house in order, putting
America first, about watching out for our interests and not being
taken advantage of and with Japan as the primary example of a
country that is taking advantage of our good will.''
   He said Japan could become an issue against Bush if there were
an economic downturn.
   ``I think the Bush administration (is seen as) standing by while
the Japanese became more and more dominant would become a major
political problem,'' said Greenberg.
   Attitudes toward Japan differ.
   In the Midwest, where the automobile industry has been hit hard,
politicians can attack Japanese trade practices with impunity.
   In California, feelings are more complex.
   ``I think there's a great concern about becoming too
jingoistic,'' said former California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., now
the state's Democratic Party chairman.
   ``It may look good in a primary or a given state race. But when
you look at how imbedded we are in a world economy it's going to be
very difficult for somebody to get very far by bashing key elements
of our own stability.''

<HEAD>Legislators Hesitate to Tell Regulators to Lay Off Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telling bank examiners to lay off is
definitely out of fashion in Washington.
   Congressmen from the Northeast want federal regulators to ease
up on their region's beleaguered banking industry. But they're also
worried about parallels to the case of the so-called ``Keating
Five'' senators who face an ethics investigation for interceding on
behalf of the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   That is making for an awkward political dance.
   ``Are some members of Congress perhaps a little gun-shy because
of the bad publicity the Keating Five got? Sure, there's no
question about it,'' said Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., chairman of
the House Small Business Committee which opened a hearing last week
on the credit crunch.
   The Lincoln episode put members of Congress under pressure to
avoid asking bank regulators to relax their watch over lending
practices.
   That kind of lobbying on behalf of Lincoln owner Charles H.
Keating Jr. has ensnarled five senators in the ethics probe.
Democrats Donald Riegle of Michigan, Alan Cranston of California,
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and John Glenn of Ohio and Republican
John McCain of Arizona all benefited from substantial contributions
from Keating and his associates.
   But corporate executives and owners of small businesses are
complaining that overzealous regulators are leaving them unable to
borrow money.
   ``The hesitancy is because of our awareness that there is an
appropriate line that the regulators have to walk in regulating
appropriately and in a balanced fashion,'' LaFalce said. ``Which is
why we're reluctant to speak too forcefully about it.''
   Shady business deals, dishonest accounting and excessive
optimism _ combined with lax regulatory oversight _ led to the
savings and loan collapse, a problem concentrated in the Southwest.
The taxpayer-funded bailout of the industry could cost as much as
$500 billion.
   Intense criticism from Congress over the thrift crisis led
regulators to crack down in the Northeast.
   ``When the crisis finally hit, the Congress got very aggressive
in going after the regulators,'' said Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,
D-Mass., a member of the House Banking Committee. ``So the
regulators say, `OK fellas, you want us to get tough well we'll
show you what getting tough is all about.'''
   Some lawmakers complain that regulators have responded with a
``SWAT team'' of examiners. They were dispatched first to New
England, where the real estate market is in a severe slump, and are
expected to move down the East Coast.
   The regulators have reclassified loans as ``nonperforming,''
have forced banks to increase their bad-loan reserve accounts and
taken other steps that have led to less capital. Small businesses
with longstanding lines of credit and no connection to the real
estate industry are finding they can no longer get the working
capital vital to their daily operations.
   Word first began to spread about the crackdown last
Thanksgiving. But it was only in the past few weeks that Kennedy,
one of the first legislators to speak out publicly about it, gave
it a high profile.
   But Kennedy said he has found colleagues are reluctant to speak
out about the Northeast's credit drought.
   ``I found that there was, at least initially, a tremendous
amount of concern about getting involved in a Keating-Five type of
circumstance,'' Kennedy said.
   That concern was evident at last week's Small Business Committee
hearing.
   Several lawmakers said they were concerned about their business
constituents, but repeatedly stressed their support for aggressive
banking oversight.
   ``For us to tell you that we have concerns about our
constituents is valid up to a point,'' Rep. Jan Meyers, R-Kan.,
told a witness representing federal regulators. ``Then I think it's
also important for us to tell you how important it is for you to do
your job.''
   In Connecticut, Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson and Democratic
Rep. Barbara Kennelly have met with federal officials about the
credit problem sweeping their state. But they also have emphasized
that they favor tough banking regulations.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., held meetings in Connecticut on
the credit crunch. But he ``said very loudly and clearly, up front
that the meetings he had with regulators or with bankers or with
borrowers had to be open to the press,'' according to Jason
Isaacson, Dodd's top aide.
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., cautioned against an
overreaction to the Keating Five affair.
   ``Should we never talk to the regulators?'' Frank said. ``If the
argument is we should never give advice to the regulators, that's
crazy.''

   As Germans celebrate the impending end of
their nation's 41-year division, West German television is
broadcasting a four-part series on the Holocaust entitled ``Death
is a Master from Germany.''
   The series' first segment was shown on Sunday, a week before the
World Jewish Congress meets for its first time on German soil.
   The selection of meeting sites in East Germany and West Germany
was intended ``to give, from a moral perspective, a Jewish point of
view on the emerging process of German unification,'' World Jewish
Congress executive director Elan Steinberg said in a recent
interview.
   While there have been many television reports on the Holocaust,
this one promises to have greater impact because of its timing and
thoroughness.
   The six-hour show accompanies popular television journalist Lea
Rosh and historian Eberhard Jaeckel as they travel through 12
different countries in Europe, visiting sites of ghettos,
deportation and concentration camps as well as the homes of
survivors, resisters, observers and war criminals.
   ``The great achievement of this film is that it turns the
audience into witnesses, even into potential participants,'' author
and critic Walter Jens wrote in a review for the weekly
newsmagazine Der Spiegel.
   Jens said the movie forces the viewer to ask ``What would you
yourself have done? What would have been your own thoughts?''
   In one scene, an elderly Jewish man tells of arriving at the
Auschwitz death camp, where about 1 million Jews were exterminated.
He asks his fellow prisoners where their wives and children were
and whether they got to see each other.
   ``They answered, `You've already been here an hour? Then they've
already been gassed and are being burned right now,''' the man
recalled.
   The movie also explores the varying participation of different
countries in the decimation of their Jewish populations.
   The documentary's title comes from a verse in the poem ``Death
Fugue,'' by poet Paul Celan, himself a Jew and Holocaust survivor.
   Excerpts from the poem are read during the film as the camera
pans over graves, barbed wire and Holocaust sites.
   ``Death is a master from Germany, his eye is blue, he strikes
thee with leaden bullets, he strikes thee exactly,'' the narrator
reads.

<HEAD>Computers May Get the Jump on Grasshoppers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can stomp grasshoppers, spread poison,
bash 'em with shovels, or burn the critters if you have to. Now,
the Agriculture Department says computers are the latest weapons.
   If some new software being evaluated by USDA experts, state and
county extension agents, consultants and ranchers proves out, the
computer programs should ready for general use in another year.
   Officials at the Grasshopper Integrated Pest Management project
in Boise, Idaho, said managing range livestock is so complex that
grasshopper control requires a huge amount of information.
   The computer program under development and testing is intended
to put information into the hands of range managers, including the
latest on grasshopper population forecasts, timing and selection of
control options, range condition assessments, weather data and an
economic analysis of management practices.
   Jim Berry of the department's rangeland insect laboratory at
Bozeman, Mont., said in a recent report that many potential users
of the new software package have had little experience with
computers.
   ``In fact, some may have an initial reluctance to use a
computer-based system,'' he said. ``Therefore, the system is
primarily menu-driven, responds quickly, and requires little
knowledge about computers to evaluate a variety of management
options.''
   Meanwhile, the threat to western rangelands and crops is real,
not part of a computer program that can be turned on and off by
somebody punching buttons.
   A relative of grasshoppers _ the Mormon cricket _ is merrily
chewing its way through parts of Utah and Idaho. These pests, named
because they attacked crops of Mormon settlers in Utah in 1848, are
also being targeted by USDA scientists.
   Last week the department's Agricultural Research Service said a
one-celled microbe that infects and kills Mormon crickets was being
released in field tests in southern Idaho.
   Entomologist John Henry of Montana State University, Bozeman,
said the microbe, a protozoan, was found naturally infecting Mormon
crickets in Colorado and Utah.
   Once it infects a cricket, the organism acts slowly, taking up
to 12 days to multiply. The microbes then kill the crickets by
consuming body fat.
   ``It could be the most promising long-term weapon against
them,'' Henry said.
   Aside from the possibility of seagulls appearing and devouring
the crickets, as they did in 1848 to save the crops of Mormon
settlers, the best bet for immediate action against destructive
insects still appears to be pesticide-laced bait and aerial
spraying.
   The anti-grasshopper lobby in Congress has been active lately,
including pushes by lawmakers from Minnesota, North Dakota and
South Dakota for more action.
   As a result, the Senate Appropriations Committee has added $6.8
million to an emergency spending bill to help control an expected
grasshopper surge this summer in drought areas of the northern
plains.
   The USDA budget for 1990 includes only $8.7 million for control
of hoppers and crickets, primarily on grasslands.
   Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., chairman of the agricultural
appropriations subcommittee, said only eight grasshoppers per
square yard can cause economic losses and that some areas are
reporting 1,000 or more hoppers per square yard.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has been asked to approve an
emergency request for the farm use of a pesticide called Asana-XL
on grasshopper eggs. The EPA has the request under review.

   A new labeling standard for organic food has
been approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee, but a major farm
organization says the bill needs more work.
   The committee voted on Friday to set a national standard for
organically grown food, and the measure will be part of the 1990
farm bill that will be considered by the full Senate later this
year.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the committee, said the
legislation ``sets one tough national standard'' for organic foods.
Labels will mean the food has been grown without substances known
to be harmful to human health or to cause environmental pollution.
   The House, which is also working on the 1990 farm bill, has not
passed similar legislation.
   But the Farm Bureau says the Leahy bill sets a national standard
for organic food and allows states to have tougher standards if
they choose. In the federation's view, this could be confusing to
consumers and farmers.
   ``Consumers need to be guaranteed that organic food for which
they paid a premium is produced in accordance with guidelines
applicable throughout the country,'' the bureau's John Datt said in
a letter to the Senate panel.
   Datt urged Leahy to hold hearings to determine an organic
standard and submit recommended legislation to Congress within 18
months after the 1990 farm bill is enacted.

   A toll-free consumer hotline operated by the
Agriculture Department is proving busier than a single telephone in
a home full of teen-agers.
   More than 64,000 persons called the USDA's meat and poultry
telephone number in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, said
hotline supervisor Sue Templin. That was the most since the service
began five years ago.
   Templin said in an annual report that most questions handled by
the hotline staff related to the handling of turkey, chicken, eggs,
beef and pork. Consumers, who made up 86 percent of the callers,
also asked frequently about freezer and refrigerator storage times,
and the food poisoning organism, salmonella.
   Other callers included business people, the news media,
government employees, students and teachers, citizen interest
groups and legislators.
   Persons with questions about the safe handling of meat and
poultry can call the hotline weekdays at 1-800-535-4555, between 10
a.m. and 4 p.m. EST. Washington, D.C., area callers should dial
447-3333.

   Donna Russell says she was ``called by
the Lord'' to open her expensive lakefront house to the homeless,
but neighbors say even God's servants must obey man's laws.
   Town zoning officials, acting on a complaint from a neighbor,
have ordered Russell to stop taking in young homeless mothers and
have threatened her with arrest.
   The zoning law in this southern Connecticut community of 33,000
requires that three-quarters of the people living in a
single-family dwelling be related by blood, marriage or adoption.
Even the town's zoning officer calls the restrictions outdated, but
that hasn't quieted Russell's neighbors.
   ``This woman told me she only follows God's law _ she doesn't
have to follow man's law,'' said Vincent Smith, a neighbor who
contacted zoning officials in December after Russell took in her
first family. ``Well, I told her there are laws in this town that
have to be followed.''
   Some residents said they suspect Russell, a real estate broker,
is out to make a buck, perhaps to help meet mortgage payments when
real estate sales are falling.
   Russell blames the opposition on snobbery and on fears that the
presence of homeless people will hurt property values.
   ``There are people lying all over the streets. If we can't take
care of our own brothers and sisters, then what good are we?'' said
Russell, a divorced mother of three.
   Russell, the owner of Sunrise Real Estate in nearby Bridgeport,
was showing the four-bedroom, three-bath house to a prospective
buyer two years ago when, she said, ``I felt spoken to from God.''
   ``I felt really called by the Lord to do this and to buy this
particular house to do this ministry in,'' she said.
   She bought the white clapboard home on Pinewood Lake in 1988 for
close to $400,000.
   Russell said she can accommodate up to three families at a time.
She's taken in four women and their children to date. Two young
mothers and their babies are now living with her, she said.
   She would not let a reporter inside her house to talk to the
families, nor would she let them be interviewed by telephone. ``I
don't want the privacy of the home exploited,'' she said.
   The town issued a series of zoning citations and eventually
threatened her with arrest. Russell filed an appeal.
   She plans to seek a waiver at a May 2 hearing before the town
Zoning Board of Appeals, saying it is unconstitutional to require
that people living under the same roof be related.
   Zoning Enforcement Officer Donald Murray said that if Trumbull's
zoning laws were fully enforced, ``You could empty out half the
town.''
   ``Anyone who moves in with his boyfriend or girlfriend in a
single-family home is violating the zoning law,'' he said. ``Times
do change, and I don't think we've kept up with them.''
   But Fred Radford, an official of the Pinewood Lake Association,
is suspicious of Russell's motives. ``The first thing that comes to
mind is, who is paying for this? Just the bare facts of it strain
credulity,'' he said.
   Russell said she is not charging the families to live with her.
   ``They have to be people not using it as a flophouse, but as a
transition period where they can move upward and take care of
themselves,'' she said.
   David Balian, director of the Alpha Home shelter in Bridgeport,
said Russell is ``sincere as a person can be,'' and he said if
enough people followed her lead, homeless shelters could close up
shop.
   Mary Bowes, one of Russell's friends, said of the conflict,
``It's sad to think people would think that no one could do
something like this from the goodness of their heart.''

   Is it a laundry hamper? A mailbox? No _ it's a
bat house.
   Thousands of oblong-shaped, bottomless bat roosts are popping up
on tree branches, house walls and garden poles throughout the
country.
   Forget your belfry. These wooden structures provide partitions
and perches so that bats can hang out with some measure of privacy
during the daylight hours.
   But when the sun sets and the mosquito swarms shatter the calm
of the night, the bat patrols swoop into action. One brown bat, the
most common species in the United States, can gobble 500 mosquitos
an hour, according to Bat Conservation International. Your
ultraviolet mosquito zapper can't improve on that batting average.
   BCI, a non-profit group based in Austin, Texas, battles the
extinction of bats around the world and debunks commonly held fears
about the warm-blooded mammals.
   ``Most people still believe bats are blind flying mice that
spread disease, suck blood from your neck and get caught in women's
hair,'' said Gary Graham, associate director of science at BCI.
   ``Wrong, on all counts.''
   Bats are more closely related to men than to mice, only about
one-third of 1 percent are vampires, and those all live in Latin
America and bother cows, Graham said.
   Bats can see just fine. But to help them fly in the dark, they
have a sonar system that emits high-pitched sounds. The echo helps
direct them to insects. ``The system is so sophisticated they don't
bump into women's heads,'' Graham said.
   As for disease, only 15 people in the United States and Canada
are known to have died in the past 40 years of rabies transmitted
by bats, far fewer than die annually from sick dogs or other pets,
BCI says.
   For the past four or five years, BCI has been selling about
10,000 bat houses a year. And this year, BCI is trying to get more
contact with the public _ and raise public awareness _ by getting
commercial suppliers into the game.
   Gardener's Supply, a Vermont-based catalogue house, advertised
pine-made bat houses in its January catalogue for the first time.
``They're selling very well,'' about 300 in three months, said
Steve Kovarie, a buyer with the firm.
   The average bat house, which retails for about $25, can hold as
many as 30 female bats at a time.
   Usually, when the females bat their lashes, a male or two will
fly into the house to visit. But ``the males like their space'' so
only about 6 would congregate in a bachelor bat house at one time,
Kovarie said.
   For best results, experts suggest placing your bat house about
15 to 25 feet above the ground facing the morning sun _ bats like
temperatures of 80 to 100 degrees _ and near a source of water.
   Don't get impatient or insulted. It could take a year or more
for your bat house to attract its first occupants. Bats find their
houses just like birds do, especially if your neighborhood lacks
natural roosts which bats prefer, such as caves or hollowed-out
tree trunks.
   Also, bats may only stay for a short while and then take off to
roost elsewhere. Bats migrate seasonally and radar has tracked them
as high as 10,000 feet at a cruising speed of about 30 miles per
hour.
   Bats have one of the lowest birthrates among mammals _ usually
one pup per year. Fortunately, conservationists say, they live to
be 20. Nonetheless, the world's bat population has declined
drastically in recent years because of vandalism and hunting of the
animals in some countries.
   The destruction endangers fragile ecosystems that rely on bats
for pollination and pest control. A recent BCI study identified 300
plant species in the tropics that rely on bats.
   Bat houses, BCI says, aid conservation and conversation.
   Squatters are no problem: because the bat houses are closed at
the top and have no bottom, birds, squirrels and other animals
can't stay.
   And how can you tell if bats live in your neighborhood? Either
watch street lamps at night to see if bats are chasing moths and
mosquitos attracted by the light. Or, buy yourself a bat detector
that picks up the critters' echolocation signals. The device is
battery-operated.

   Marla Maples upstaged the president of the
United States, the city's notorious mayor and one pretty well-known
comedian just by, well, just by being Marla Maples.
   The so-called other woman in the Trump marital split was the
talk of the White House Correspondents Association dinner Saturday,
getting most of the attention from 2,500 of the capital's movers
and shakers and the reporters who write about them.
   She had two burly bodyguards to keep the paparazzi and curious
from pressing too close. But ``Saturday Night Live'' comedian
Dennis Miller tossed a few barbs her way.
   Miller said he had flown ``in this afternoon on the Trump
Shuttle, or as it's been affectionately renamed `The Ugly American
Airline.'''
   ``Marla, kidding. Kidding, Marla,'' he said. ``I love him, too.''
   Even Barbara Bush told reporters Sunday that her one
disappointment at the dinner was that she failed to catch a glimpse
of the face that has graced a thousand tabloids.
   Ms. Maples, a guest of Time magazine, was following in the
footsteps of Fawn Hall and Donna Rice, who turned heads at past
dinners.
   Miller also poked fun at another prominent guest.
   ``I understand Mayor Marion Barry is here tonight. Had a wacky
couple of months there, didn't you, Marion? Woooow! Well, you talk
about a liberal,'' he said of Barry, soon to face trial on cocaine
charges.
   President Bush did his own stand-up comedy turn, using his press
secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, as the foil.
   ``We originally wanted to launch the Hubble Telescope a year ago
to take a group shot of Marlin,'' said Bush of his spokesman, who
recently went on a drastic diet to reduce his girth.
   Bush, often the butt of jokes on NBC's late-night comedy show,
said Dana Carvey's impression of him on ``Saturday Night Live'' is
``so good that I asked him to phone Rafsanjani and tell him that it
was George Bush. But Dana said, `Wouldn't be prudent, wouldn't be
prudent.'''

Insurgents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The gunman who assassinated Carlos
Pizarro, a leftist guerrilla turned presidential candidate, may
also have dealt a death blow to hopes for a peaceful end to 30
years of insurrection in Colombia.
   Pizarro was the leader of the April 19th Movement, known as
M-19, the only leftist guerrilla group to lay down its arms under a
peace plan offered by President Virgilio Barco.
   He had been a leftist guerrilla for 16 years and Barco hoped to
hold him up as a symbol of peaceful political participation in
order to persuade three other active rebel groups to lay down their
arms.
   A gunman on a suicide mission killed the 38-year-old Pizarro
aboard a Colombian jetliner on Thursday.
   M-19 members have said they will honor the peace pact signed
last month, but some say prospects for ending Colombia's armed
insurgency now appear dimmer than ever.
   ``The likelihood that other guerrilla groups will follow their
path is significantly reduced if not eliminated,'' a Medellin human
rights official told The Associated Press.
   He spoke on condition of anonymity because three other members
of the human rights group have been assassinated.
   ``For the government, so determined to carry forward the
political project with the M-19, Pizarro's death was a fatal
blow,'' a columnist for Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper wrote last
week.
   Another M-19 leader, Antonio Navarro, said on nationwide
television after Thursday's killing that he doubted peace was
possible in Colombia.
   Still, Navarro announced Saturday that he would take Pizarro's
place as the group's candidate for president.
   The task of persuading the guerrillas to make peace was a
daunting one even with Pizarro alive and promising to mediate in
the negotiations with other rebel groups.
   Two of those groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
and the People's Liberation Army, have expressed interest in a
settlement. But they continue to fight army troops in rural areas.
   Another group, the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN,
has said it will never negotiate with the government. The ELN,
inspired by the Cuban revolution, resented Pizarro for cutting a
deal with the government.
   A field commander of the rebel group told an Associated Press
reporter at an ELN base last month that Pizarro was a ``fool who
was going to get himself killed.''
   Resented by the extreme left, loathed by the extreme right, and
a tempting target for drug traffickers, Pizarro could have been
killed by any of the groups.
   A Friday editorial in El Tiempo said ``There are so many
questions and so much confusion that we do not dare even offer a
hypothesis.''
   The boundaries separating groups suspected in Pizarro's killing
are fuzzy. Drug traffickers have financed right-wing death squads
to protect their rural land holdings from leftist guerrillas.
   The attorney general's office is investigating the possible
participation by elements in the military in massacres carried out
by the squads.
   Traffickers, anxious to destabilize Barco's government, may have
killed Pizarro to poison one of the president's successes.
   Extreme rightists may have killed Pizarro to destroy the peace
process. Right-wing death squads have killed more than 1,000
leftists in the last six years.
   And hard-liners in military stand to benefit from Pizarro's
death. The instability created by the assassination has created a
mood of crisis that may lead to more emergency measures and
infringements on civil liberties.
   With 48 hours of Pizarro's death, President Barco ordered that a
3,000 man anti-terrorist police squad fighting drug traffickers be
doubled.
   Pizarro made a lot of enemies among the country's armed forces
as the M-19 carried out dramatic attacks against the government
during 16 years of insurgency. Some members of the army undoubtedly
resented their former enemy chatting with the president and
appearing on national television.
   In recent interviews, Pizarro admitted he was afraid. But he
said his desire to lead Colombia was greater than his fear of an
assassin's bullet.
   Two other presidential candidates besides Pizarro have been
assassinated during the campaign for May 27 elections.
   Sen. Luis Carlos Galan of the governing Liberal Party was gunned
down in August at a political rally in Bogota, and Bernardo
Jaramillo of the leftist Patriotic Union Party was killed last
month at the city's airport.
   Authorities blamed those assassinations on drug traffickers.
   The media, citing security sources, say traffickers are the main
suspects in Pizarro's killing as well.
   But no government official has yet said who was believed
responsible for Pizarro's assassination, and conflicting anonymous
claims have been made.
   Galan's assassination set off Barco's crackdown on drug
traffickers, which was answered with a retaliatory wave of
assassinations and bombings.
   Traffickers have killed nearly 300 Colombians in the past nine
months in an effort to halt the government's campaign to capture
and extradite cocaine barons to the United States.

<HEAD>EPA Finds Little Dioxin Risk in Paper Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amounts of cancer-causing dioxins in milk
cartons, coffee filters and toilet tissues are too small to pose a
health problem, according to a government report that seeks to ease
concerns about bleached paper products.
   Some environmentalists have raised concern about the use of the
products since it was discovered in recent years that traces of the
highly toxic dioxins _ a byproduct of the bleaching process _
remained in the wood pulp.
   The Environmental Protection Agency was to announce its findings
on dioxins in bleached paper later today, including agency plans to
continue pressing the industry to reduce dioxin contamination of
paper products.
   ``There's not enough of a risk to create a public concern,'' an
agency official familiar with the findings said Sunday.
   He said in each case the cancer risk from dioxin contamination
of paper products was no greater than one in 1 million. That's
below the threshold where regulatory action would be considered.
   But the EPA continues to have serious concerns about dioxin
contamination of waterways near some paper mills, according to
agency officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   According to the EPA findings, dioxin contamination of fish near
some of the paper mills was found to be high enough to pose a
cancer risk of one in 1,000 to people who frequently consume fish
from those waterways.
   That is a thousand times greater than the risk threshold level
the EPA normally uses when considering regulatory action in cases
involving the contamination of food products by cancer-causing
chemicals.
   A risk level of one in 1,000 means one person out of 1,000
people similarly exposed would be expected to get cancer because of
the contamination.
   Overall, the dioxin levels in fish varied widely among the
various mills, officials said. No information about specific mills
was available.
   Dioxins are a family of highly toxic chemicals that cause cancer
and birth defects. The chemical is of particular concern because it
remains in the body of any organism that ingests it and it migrates
up the food chain.
   A series of studies by the EPA and paper industry revealed over
the past five years that dioxins are a byproduct of the paper
bleaching process and that some amounts of dioxins are transferred
to paper products.
   Bleached paper is used in a variety of paper products including
coffee filters, paper towels, food containers and packaging, facial
tissue, toilet paper, disposable diapers and milk or beverage
cartons. The most significant concern has been with products in
direct contact with foods such as milk cartons or meat packaging.
   Red Caveny, president of the American Paper Institute, said the
38 operators of the 104 mills that produce bleached paper have
joined in a $2 billion program aimed at reducing dioxin
contamination. ``We have been able to reduce the levels (of
dioxins) almost 50 percent in the last two years,'' he said in an
interview.
   Caveny said about half of the bleached paper products now have
dioxin levels of no more than 2 parts per trillion _ levels so low
they are similar to ``background'' levels found in many food
products. Similar reductions will be achieved in other products
over the next two years as more mills make processing changes, he
said.
   Some environmentalists said, however, that no level of dioxin
contamination is acceptable.
   Karen Florini, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund,
called the industry's attempts to reduce dioxin contamination ``a
step in the right direction'' but expressed continuing concern
about the high level of dioxins found in fish near some of the
paper mills.
   ``There's no reason why consumers should have to accept any
dioxin in their paper. Just because it's white doesn't mean it's
pure,'' said Shelley Stewart, who is with the Greenpeace
environmental group.

   Followers of the Rev. George Stallings and his
breakaway African-American church are standing by him despite
allegations that Stallings had a homosexual relationship with a man
he put on the payroll of his former church.
   ``The holy wars have begun,'' Bill Marshall, a spokesman for
Stallings, said after reports were published in The Washington Post
on Sunday.
   ``This stuff is trash. The people of the African-American
Catholic congregation will continue its planning and installation
of its first bishop-elect George Augustus Stallings Jr. on May
12th,'' he said.
   The newspaper, in a series of three articles that continued
today, quoted a 25-year-old man who said he had a sexual
relationship with Stallings for two years. The man told the Post
that Stallings put him to work as a pastoral assistant at the St.
Teresa of Avila parish.
   The Post also reported Sunday that documents it had obtained
show Stallings paid for improvements on his home using out of a
church account. It said he bought the $60,000 home and decorated it
elaborately while he was earning $10,000 annually as a priest.
   The newspaper also said two men claimed Stallings had sex with
them when they were altar boys.
   Last summer, Stallings charged the Roman Catholic Church with
being racist and formed the Imani Temple African-American Catholic
Congregation.
   Stallings refused comment when asked about the newspaper report
following services Sunday at his Imani Temple.
   ``No matter what we are going through, we need not forget that
Jesus is in our midst and we are never alone,'' Stallings told the
congregation. ``God will take care of the situation,'' he said
without specifically mentioning the newspaper article.
   Parishioners attending services Sunday appeared unmoved by the
allegations.
   ``All of this news about Father Stallings does not faze me at
all because Imani Temple is going to go on, we are going to move
on,'' said Precilla Brown, an usher at the church.
   ``First they try to assassinate you, and that's what they are
doing now, trying to assassinate our spiritual leader,'' said J.
Ann Franklin, a Stallings follower since 1978.

<HEAD>Families Stage Sleep-In At Government Building To Press For
Housing</HEAD>

   Fed up with waiting for the bureaucracy to provide
adequate housing, a score of families has moved into a second-floor
conference room in a city government building.
   Vladimir I. Lenin, kind-eyed and smiling in the approved
picture, stares benevolently from the wall at a jumble of toddlers,
their bottles, food packages, piles of clothing and chairs pushed
together for beds.
   On April 15, the families took over the room in the government
and Communist Party headquarters of Moscow's Kiev district, where
Lenin's heirs have decided for generations what would be done for
whom ... and when.
   ``We won't leave here until each of us gets the key to a big,
new apartment,'' said Katya Belyakova. Three of the children are
hers.
   The Soviet housing shortage is severe. A figure quoted often is
that one in five people must share apartments.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev launched a much-heralded program
several years ago to provide every citizen or family a private
place to live by the year 2000. Like many of his other reform
schemes, the plan has gone nowhere and the waiting list for
apartments lengthens.
   Residents of many rundown apartments in central Moscow are being
moved to new buildings in other areas so the downtown structures
can be renovated, but building materials are anything but abundant.
   Mrs. Belyakova, her husband and the children were sharing an
apartment with three other families and the situation drove them to
despair. She said the other families quarrel over the use of the
single toilet and other facilities, and were pinching, pushing and
shouting at her children.
   Each family under Lenin's gaze in the 750-square-foot room has
three or more children. Many Russian couples have limited
themselves to one or two because of the housing shortage, so three
or more is considered a ``family with many children.''
   The protesters are a mix of teachers, laborers, architects,
artists and engineers.
   Soviet law declares that the size of their families entitles
them to new housing no more than three years after they apply, but
many of the protesters have been crowded five or more to a room for
years.
   At the square, white Kiev district office building, children run
in the halls while parents draft statements, seek meetings with
officials, make posters and plan strategy.
   Protesters come and go freely, but at least 15 adults and some
of the children settle in to sleep every night.
   District officials have not tried to evict them, and say they
are trying to find apartments for the squatters in a new six-story
building originally intended for officials of the Communist Party
Central Committee bureaucracy.
   Anatoly A. Shchukin, a deputy to the district government
chairman, says no increase is expected this year in the number of
apartments available.
   The district administration, which oversees services for 166,000
people, has a waiting list of 15,000 and a shorter list of
invalids, military veterans, heroes of labor and others with
priority.
   Families with many children have such a special claim, but it is
near the bottom.
   About 40 percent of the district's housing is controlled by the
Communist Party or other groups, so local officials are pressing
the Moscow City Council for more.
   Shchukin said he understood the predicament of the protesters
and there had been little conflict during the sit-in. Protesters
are allowed to use the building's dining hall.
   But he objected to the protesting parents' having brought their
children, who must use the same toilets and sinks as scores of
visitors to the building and are thus subjected to whatever
illnesses those people bring with them.
   But the living doesn't seem to bother either the children or
their parents.
   Kostya Komkov, a 3-year-old with a dirty face, said: ``I don't
like it at home. I like to live in the white building. No place to
play at home. Plenty here. I like playing here.''
   Tanya Polyotova, who works at a psychology clinic and has three
children, said of life in one room: ``I look at my children and see
them going downhill. They are deteriorating day by day because of
the conditions we live in. They have neither space nor peace at
home to develop their abilities.''
   Larissa Prikhodko said 11-year-old Volodya, her eldest son, had
not attended school for more than a year.
   She said the noise of a baby and two other children kept him up
at night and he began falling asleep in class, so she took him out.
   On Friday, two representatives of the protesters met with an
official of the Moscow City Council and came away with hope that
the city would turn the new six-story building over to the Kiev
district.
   The building was featured in news reports and became an
embarrassment for authorities, first to the Communists then to the
Supreme Soviet legislature, which had planned to house deputies
there when they were in Moscow.
   Valentin Trusov, chairman of the Kiev district executive
council, said that an agreement had been reached to turn over 85
percent of the apartments in the building to either Afghan war
veterans or large families.
   ``We are going to distribute the flats openly and according to
the priorities on the list, and so it might be that not all of the
strikers will receive apartments,'' he said.
   Even if the building is turned over to district authorities,
Shchukin said, months will be needed to finish the work on it and
complete the formal transfer. And its 56 apartments would hardly
make a dent even in the short, priority list for housing.

   Too many colleges are sidestepping social ills
like alcohol abuse and bigotry that threaten campus life, a new
report says.
   More than half of the college presidents surveyed in the report,
``Campus Life: In Search of Community,'' said the quality of life
at their schools was a more serious problem than a few years ago.
   But the 148-page report released Sunday concluded that many have
``sought to sidestep rather than confront the issue.''
   ``The idyllic vision so routinely portrayed in college
promotional materials often masks disturbing realities of student
life,'' the report said.
   The study was a joint project of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, in Princeton, N.J., and the American
Council on Education, a Washington-based higher education lobby.
   The findings were based on visits to 18 campuses, interviews
with teachers, students and administrators across the nation, and
national surveys of 382 college and university presidents and 355
chief student affairs officers conducted in 1989.
   Among the survey findings:
   _ Two-thirds of the presidents considered alcohol abuse a
``moderate'' or ``major'' problem.
   _ Forty-three percent said campus crime had increased over five
years.
   _ One out of four presidents said racial tensions were problems
on their campuses.
   _ Sixty-two percent of presidents at research-oriented
universities said sexual harassment was a ``moderate'' or ``major''
problem, and 48 percent said the same of racial harassment.
   _ Sixty percent of student affairs officers said their campus
had a written policy on bigotry, and another 11 percent said they
were working on one.
   ``Since the '60s, the notion of universities having parental
authority has greatly diminished,'' said Ernest L. Boyer, president
of Carnegie, in an interview. ``But we haven't found new ways to
think about the social and civic dimensions of campus life.
Universities don't know how to exercise authority even when they
see incivility.''
   ``Partly out of confusion, there has been a drifting around the
civic dimensions of campus life, and nowhere is that more apparent
than in racial and ethnic relations.
   A Chicano student interviewed said, ``We carry a stigma. When I
first came here as a freshman, a white undergraduate said to me,
`You're here but my friend who is better qualified, is not.'''
   At another campus, a black candidate for student government said
a white student asked him, ``Is the other candidate on your ticket
a nigger, too?''
   Blacks, Hispanics and other ethnic groups have formed exclusive
clubs or unions. One campus even had a white student union. But
such groups, while understandable, may heighten campus tensions.
   The report urged colleges not to fight bigotry with restrictive
speech codes, such as the one passed several years ago by
racially-troubled University of Michigan. Instead, they should
affirm freedom of expression while condemning campus bigotry in no
uncertain terms.
   The report said students must be encouraged to look beyond
personal goals to their responsibilities to the school community
and to society at-large. School officials, in turn, need to show
genuine concern about student needs.
   Classrooms should be a starting point for rebuilding this lost
sense of community. Students, for example, should be given
opportunities to work together, not just compete. And the
curriculum should have a sense of shared intellectual purpose, and
not just be a smorgasbord of courses, the report said.

<HEAD>Soviet Fighter Was Shot Down in 1960 U-2 Incident, Red Army Says</HEAD>

   When the Russians downed a U.S. spy plane in the
famous U-2 incident 30 years ago, they also accidentally blew one
of their own aircraft out of the sky, killing the pilot, the Soviet
army newspaper has disclosed.
   The U-2 plane, piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down on
May 1, 1960, disrupting a summit meeting 19 days later in Paris
between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned
for later that year.
   The newspaper Red Star said in the article Sunday that the
Soviets mistakenly shot down a MiG-19 and its pilot in the
operation.
   The paper also disclosed that the Soviets sent up a new fighter
plane and ordered its pilot to ram the U-2 in a suicide mission.
The new fighter reached the U-2's altitude but failed to ram it.
   Red Star said that Khrushchev was atop Lenin's Mausoleum on Red
Square watching the May Day parade when he learned that a Soviet
new model SA-2 surface-to-air missile had brought down the U-2.
   The commander of the Soviet air defense forces, Marshal Sergei
Biryuzov, climbed the mausoleum ``carrying happy news, that the
plane had been hit by the first rocket,'' the article said. ``And
Khrushchev, standing right there on the tribune, congratulated the
marshal.''
   Khrushchev, in memoirs smuggled to the West and published in
1974, wrote that diplomats watching the parade knew something big
had happened because Biryuzov wore a duty uniform rather than the
parade dress worn by the other military officers in Red Square.
   Soviets hurrying to the May Day parade in the Ural Mountain city
of Sverdlovsk saw a far different sight, what appeared to be
fireworks high in the air, said the article, signed by a Col. A.
Dokuchayev.
   The fiery debris was not fireworks, but a Soviet MiG-19 that was
hit by the same type of missile that exploded behind Power's U-2
and damaged it, Red Star said in the most detailed version of the
Soviet military action.
   Powers' mission began in Pakistan and was to have carried him
over Sverdlovsk for a landing in Norway.
   He used neither the automatic destruction device nor poison he
had been given in case the mission failed, and he was captured at a
collective farm near Sverdlovsk. He was held for three years, then
exchanged for the Soviet spy Rudolph Abel. Powers published his
memoirs in 1970.
   The Soviet article disclosed for the first time that the Soviets
had ordered a new model Sukhoi-9 fighter to pursue the U-2 in an
unsuccessful ramming attempt. The Su-9 was unarme but was able
reach nearly to the 70,000 feet at which the U-2 operated, the
report said.
   The Soviets also used two MiG-19's, which were not capable of
flying that high. The pilot of one MiG-19, Boris Ivazyan, reported
to ground control that the debris from the U-2 was actually that
from a missile that had missed the U-2, prompting the ground
battery to fire another.
   The next Soviet missile struck the MiG-19 flown by Sergei
Safronov, 30, who was killed. He was one of 21 Soviets given medals
for their role in bringing down Powers, and the Red Star article
disclosed for the first time that he was honored posthumously.
   Ivazyan survived and later married Safronov's widow.
   U.S. accounts say that the decision to send Powers was
controversial within the Eisenhower administration. The Soviets had
tried to shoot down a U-2 over the same area on April 9, and some
within the administration feared sending another mission could
jeopardize U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The U-2 incident ended a thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations and was
followed by some of the worst moments of the Cold War: the Bay of
Pigs landing of U.S.-backed forces in Cuba in January 1961, the
construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, and the Cuban missile
crisis in October 1962.

<HEAD>Congress Pressing for Pentagon's Long-Term Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The futuristic ``wish lists'' prepared by the
nation's top admirals and generals for inclusion in a long-term
outline of U.S. defense needs usually don't attract much attention,
but times have changed.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has promised to keep Congress
informed, while noting that normally he wouldn't disclose the
results of his consultations with the service chiefs until the
budget process was much further along.
   Testifying last week before congressional panels, Cheney even
joked about how defense planning has changed.
   ``Used to be when you prepared a (long-term plan) around here,
nobody cared very much, because it didn't embody much change _
Commies were Commies,'' he said. ``Now, because we've got all of
these interesting new questions to address, there are significant
changes embodied in our long-term planning.''
   The crumbling Soviet economy, revolution almost everywhere in
the Warsaw Pact and lowered estimates of Moscow's defense spending
have focused Capitol Hill's attention on the Pentagon's budget
forecasts for the next six fiscal years.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said Sunday the U.S. defense budget should be cut by as
much as 30 percent over the next five years.
   ``In the long run, the influence of this country is not going to
depend on military strength _ others don't feel the need for it.
It's going to depend on our economic clout,'' he said on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press.''
   Boren said it may be difficult to make deep cuts in the first
year because many military contracts have already been let, but
said he favors the kind of lower defense spending figures now being
prepared by the Senate Budget Committee.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said Sunday the budget panel is cutting too deeply.
   ``We have to keep in mind there are still other dangers in the
world, including the Middle East, Korea, the Pacific and including
near home,'' Nunn said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' program.
   Appearing on the show with Cheney and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, on the show, Nunn
called for careful planning that would allow the United States to
``reverse course'' if necessary.
   Cheney, who has submitted administration plans calling for an
inflation-adjusted 2 percent annual reduction in defense spending,
called for caution.
   ``I have to consider Soviet military capabilities ... not just
stated Soviet intentions. Intentions can change overnight;
capabilities last a long time,'' he said.
   So far, Cheney has not outlined how his proposed 2 percent
annual cuts would be accomplished beyond fiscal 1991, which begins
next Oct. 1. However, all sides acknowledge the need for an
outline, primarily because of the lengthy lead time needed for
purchasing weapons and determining other Pentagon costs.
   Nunn and other lawmakers have complained they cannot make
decisions on the administration's proposed $303.3 billion budget
plan for next year until they get the Pentagon's long-term outlook.
   ``I think you need a theme if you're going to get Congress to do
something which is tough, which is to close bases,'' Aspin said
Sunday.
   Cheney's proposal last week to sharply reduce purchases of B-2
Stealth bombers, coupled with major spending reductions in other
warplanes in the coming years, has helped relieve some of the
tension.
   Aspin, one of Cheney's toughest critics, called the defense
secretary's latest pronouncements a ``step in the right
direction,'' but added: ``I don't think that that's going far
enough.''

<HEAD>Police: Dispute Over Girl Leaves Two Teen-Agers Dead, Two Injured</HEAD>

   A teen-ager angry over a slight to his
girlfriend allegedly lured four youths to a schoolyard and shot
them, killing two and injuring the others, according to police.
   The four Bronx teen-agers were forced to kneel before they were
shot Saturday night, police said. Louis Perez, 17, surrendered
Sunday, police said.
   Perez was charged with two counts of murder, two counts of
attempted murder, criminal possession of a firearm and criminal use
of a firearm, police spokesman Anthony Mazzola said.
   Detective Capt. John Creegan said police believe Perez was upset
because one or more of the four teen-agers had slighted a
13-year-old girl he was dating.
   Witnesses said the four were playing basketball at a public
school when Perez, who was with two friends, came up and offered a
marijuana cigarette, Creegan said.
   The group went down steps to the back door of the school, where
police found 18 spent bullet casings, Creegan said.
   Nelson Rivera, 15, died at the scene, Mazzola said. Carlos
Young, also 15, died a short time later at Jacobi Hospital, police
said.
   A third 15-year-old was shot in the legs and reported in good
condition. His name was not released because of his age. Manuel
Allende, 18, was shot in the stomach and leg and was in guarded
condition at Jacobi, authorities said.
   The two youths that accompanied Perez were not charged in the
shootings, police said.

<HEAD>Voters to Decide on Sin Taxes for Sports-Business Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS J. SHEERAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters will take a swing at higher taxes on
liquor and cigarettes in a referendum to finance a new complex
intended to create jobs and keep the Cleveland Indians in town.
   Supporters of the May 8 ``sin tax'' proposal include much of
Cleveland's political and business establishment, which hopes to
parlay a $344 million sports-business complex into another showcase
for a city polishing its comeback image.
   Union leaders, including the Teamsters and United Auto Workers,
have led the opposition, arguing the tax would hit blue-collar and
low-income smokers and drinkers in favor of the wealthy and sports
fans.
   Besides an open-air baseball stadium, the proposal includes a
basketball arena and adjacent office and retail complex downtown.
   ``We are trying to create a synergistic environment in downtown
Cleveland where this stadium and arena act as a magnet for the
creation of jobs,'' Mayor Michael R. White said.
   White, who took office Jan. 1, said the project was important
enough to Cleveland's future to risk a politically embarrassing
setback with a tax defeat.
   But Melvin Drimmer, a Cleveland State University professor who
has campaigned against the stadium, said the idea of building an
open-air stadium for a city with Cleveland's harsh climate was
``breathtaking in its stupidity.''
   ``We need a domed stadium because the weather is terrible here.
... We're going against the trend of every major city in America,''
he said.
   Drimmer said plans for an 18,000- to 20,000-seat basketball
arena at the complex conflicted with the 13,000-seat Cleveland
State University arena under construction 10 blocks away. He said
the tax proposal amounted to asking people to pay ``for luxury
boxes for the rich and suburban elite.''
   The stadium project is envisioned as a new home for the Indians,
who share the Depression-era, open-air Cleveland Stadium with the
football Browns. The stadium seats 74,483 for baseball, 80,098 for
football.
   The Browns routinely sell out the stadium, but the owners of the
Indians, developer-brothers Richard and David Jacobs, complain the
sprawling stadium overlooking windy Lake Erie is unsuited for
baseball.
   The Indians, who averaged 16,695 fans last season while
finishing sixth, have not won a pennant since 1954.
   The Browns would remain at Cleveland Stadium, which is leased by
the Browns from the city and managed by a corporation run by
Browns' owner Art Modell.
   The project was expanded to include an arena in hopes of luring
the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team from the Coliseum, located
in suburban Richfield. The Cavaliers owners have not said whether
they would move.
   If approved by voters, financing for half the cost of the
project would come from taxes of 1.9 cents on a 12-ounce glass of
beer, 1.7 cents on a 5-ounce glass of wine, 3.7 cents on a drink
with 1{ ounces of liquor and 4.5 cents on a pack of cigarettes. The
tax would last 15 years.
   The remainder would come from the teams and private financing.
   Richard Jacobs has not said directly that he would endorse
moving the Indians to a different city if the new complex isn't
built, but he supports the tax proposal as a way to provide his
team with a new Cleveland home.
   Asked whether the team might leave Cleveland if voters don't
approve the stadium tax, Jacobs said, ``I don't have total control
over my destiny. ... These teams are ruled by the (baseball)
commissioner and the ultimate decision would be in the
commissioner's office, in his hands.
   ``I know this, that in 1985, 1986 and 1987 the attendance was so
dismal that other team owners were seriously considering why
Cleveland should still retain a franchise,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trial of Reputed Medellin Smuggler Immerses Heartland in Drug War</HEAD>

   The Justice Department says the trial of
reputed drug smuggler Jose Abello-Silva has altered the belief the
U.S. heartland is ``immune'' from the drug trail between the
Colombian jungle and America's inner cities.
   ``You have a major violator being tried in federal court in
their backyard,'' said Justice Department spokeswoman Harri Kramer.
``If they think the Medellin cartel does not have its eyes on the
Midwest, they're sadly mistaken and this is demonstrable proof.''
   Abello, 35, went on trial more than two weeks ago on charges of
conspiring to import drugs and conspiring to possess and distribute
drugs.
   He was indicted by a federal grand jury in Tulsa on Sept. 2,
1987. The indictment accuses Abello of involvement in a conspiracy
to ship more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine and 6,200 pounds of
marijuana to the United States.
   Abello, who was arrested last year in a Bogota restaurant and
extradited in October, has appeared relaxed in the courtroom,
smiling at times for a sketch artist and waving when witnesses
identified him during testimony. His wife and uncle have sat
quietly nearby, his wife rubbing wooden beads in her hands.
   Defense attorney Richard Haynes said in opening statements in
federal court that Abello ``has never been to Oklahoma, never
called to Oklahoma and no one in Oklahoma ever called him.''
   But testimony last week from Abello's boyhood friend, Boris
Olarte-Morales, sought to explain why the man prosecutors contend
is the fourth highest member of the Medellin drug cartel is
standing trial in a federal courtroom in Oklahoma.
   Olarte said he tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting in July
1986 in Aruba with Abello and a pilot, Frank Palmero, so they could
combine forces to import cocaine.
   About the same time near the rural Oklahoma town of Seminole,
authorities arrested a drug courier en route to Colorado. That led
to the arrest of two drug dealers, Joe Fagan and Matthew Martinich,
who agreed to work for the government.
   They called Olarte from Tulsa and arranged to import 500
kilograms of cocaine into the United States. Olarte was arrested in
Panama and brought to Tulsa to face charges.
   He wanted out and needed money, so he said he suggested to his
common-law wife that she resurrect the Aruba meeting between Abello
and Palmero.
   After a series of alleged meetings in Aruba and Florida, and
phone calls and money exchanges between Florida and Tulsa, Abello
was indicted in September 1987.
   He was arrested two years later in a Bogota restaurant and
extradited here in October.
   ``In Oklahoma, he may be the biggest fish. Elsewhere in the
country, he may not be a big fish,'' Ms. Kramer said of Abello.
``Nonetheless, he still is charged with conspiracy to distribute
and that is not insignificant.''

<HEAD>Parents Search McMartin School for Hidden Tunnels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convinced that their children
were molested, angry parents are digging up the soon-to-be
demolished McMartin Pre-School in a search for hidden rooms and
tunnels.
   A Superior Court jury acquitted Peggy McMartin Buckey of 12
charges and her son, Raymond, 31, of 40 counts in connection with
the case last January.
   Buckey is being retried on eight counts on which jurors
deadlocked, a dramatically diminished number compared to the
hundreds once described as alleged victims at the Manhattan Beach
school.
   More than a dozen former McMartin students had talked to
prosecutors about a trap door, tunnel or secret underground room at
the school, said Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson, but none
was ever found.
   Only one student actually testified at the trial about a secret
molestation room and he didn't indicate it was underground.
   A search of the school years ago turned up no passageways or
trap doors and no signs that floor tiles had been replaced or
concrete had been patched, Gunson said.
   But the parents refuse to give up.
   ``We're not letting go because we want the children to be
believed,'' said Robert Salas, whose son attended the school but
did not testify at the trial.
   ``The tunnel story was just one of the stories they told, and
they've been ridiculed,'' Salas said in a recent interview.
   The number of parents involved in the excavation was not
immediately known.
   The McMartin school is now owned by Hermosa Beach real estate
broker Arnold Goldstein, who plans to raze it and put up an office
buiding. He has given the parents until May 10 to do their digging.
   ``I'm permitting these people to go on the property to find
whatever they want and get it out of their system,'' Goldstein
said. ``It would be nice if this would all die down.''
   The parents are videotaping their efforts, which so far include
tearing up the school floor and digging underneath. They say they
found an area nine feet down that was filled with soft dirt and
sealed by a patchwork of concrete. This could have been an
underground secret room where their children were allegedly
molested, they said.
   Deputy District Attorney Joe Martinez, one of two prosecutors
assigned to Buckey's retrial, said the excavation was not requested
by his office.
   ``We just feel this is something between other parents and the
owner of McMartin,'' he said. ``We have a strong case. We don't
need anything more.
   ``If they came up with something great _ pornographic photos for
example _ of course we'd be interested,'' he added.
   The final stage of jury selection for Buckey's retrial is
scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   The first trial lasted nearly three years and cost $13 million,
the longest, costliest criminal proceeding in U.S. history.
   Martinez has said he believes the retrial can be completed in
six months.

<HEAD>Military Ruler Says Coup Plotters In Cahoots With Rebels</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to DELETE reference to government el-Bashir
overthrew. ADDS one graf of background on Sudan's tradition as
secular state.
^By MOHAMED OSMAN</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The country's military ruler says leaders
of last week's coup attempt sought to end the rule of Islamic law,
restore secular civilian government and seek political accomodation
with southern rebels.
   Speaking to reporters for the first time since the coup was
crushed, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir vowed there would never be
a secular state in Sudan.
   He told a news conference held amid tight security on Sunday
that the main plotters of the overthrow attempt were leftists from
political parties he dissolved after ousting a civilian government
in a June 30 coup.
   Officials of el-Bashir's government say the coup attempt, which
was crushed with little fighting, stemmed from a conspiracy among
rebellious officers and politicians who issued an underground
anti-junta declaration late last year.
   The declaration advocated the overthrow of the 15-man ruling
junta and the drafting of a constitution as steps toward returning
partisan politics to Sudan with the participation of rebels in the
largely Christian and animist south.
   The rebels have been fighting a 7-year-old civil war with the
Moslem-dominated north to demand greater autonomy and economic
reforms.
   On Tuesday, el-Bashir's government executed 28 officers,
including three retired generals and a brigadier, by firing squad
for alleged roles in the previous day's coup attempt. A colonel was
acquitted.
   Two days later, eight army officers were convicted and given
prison sentences of up to 15 years.
   El-Bashir told reporters that the coup plotters had kept the
runway of the Khartoum airport open to allow the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army to land troops in the capital to assist
them in case they succeeded in overthrowing the government.
   He said the government was nevertheless interested in finding a
peaceful settlement of the civil war: ``We will continue our
efforts and dialogue will continue, unless of course the rebel
movement reject it.''
   The military leader said documents and evidence seized with the
coup plotters revealed that they planned to assassinate leaders of
the political parties he dissolved and blame his junta for the
killings.
   El-Bashir said four military tribunals were still trying an
unspecified number of army officers involved in the coup attempt.
   He added that 27 people, both military and civilian, were being
tried for involvement in an earlier phase of the same plot that was
broken up in March at the planning stage.
   Although Sudan's 34 years of independence have been largely
under military rule, never before were so many people executed
after a coup attempt.
   In 1971, two years after a coup made Maj. Gen. Gaafar Nimeiri
president, he had 14 soldiers and civilians shot or hanged after
surviving a bid by Communists to overthrow his regime.
   Sudan a traditionally secular state until September 1983, when
Nimeiri decreed Sharia, or the rule of Islamic law.

<HEAD>FBI Arrests Man on Charges of Kidnapping Mailman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man has been charged with helping to
kidnap a New Jersey letter carrier five years ago, stealing his
uniform and forcing his way into a banker's house to extort
$200,000, the FBI said.
   The bureau said Darryl Pierre Devose was arrested Saturday in
New York after the unsolved crime was featured on the Fox
television network show, ``America's Most Wanted.''
   If convicted, he faces up to 45 years in prison and a $10,000
fine, the FBI said in a statement Sunday.
   Devose and a second person allegedly confronted the letter
carrier in East Orange and handcuffed him inside the rear of his
vehicle, the bureau said. One of them dressed in the carrier's
uniform went to the home of a United Counties Trust Co. bank
officer in Elizabeth.
   The statement did not say if Devose was the person wearing the
uniform.
   A member of the officer's family opened the door when the man
said he had a registered package. The two people then forced their
way inside the house and called the bank, demanding $200,000, the
FBI said.
   While the suspects were inside the home, the mail carrier
managed to alert passers-by, who called police. When the suspects
saw police outside the house, they fled through a rear door, the
statement said. No money was turned over.
   Devose was identified shortly after the crime and had been
sought by authorities, the FBI said.

   The dollar was higher in early European trading
today and foreign currency dealers said they expected it to remain
steady in the absence of fresh market-affecting news.
   Gold prices also rose in Europe.
   Trading was quiet, with Japanese markets closed for a national
holiday. Some European markets were to close on Tuesday for the May
Day holiday.
   ``I see most currency rates remaining stable with no strong
direction,'' said Kirby Hoeft of Merrill Lynch International Bank
in London.
   ``I'm not looking for any move on the dollar,'' added Andrew
Ellott of Chase Investment Bank.
   Dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:

<HEAD>`America's Hometown' Votes To Keep 350-Year Tradition of
Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plymouth voters have rejected a measure
that would have scrapped the town's 350-year tradition of town
meetings in favor of a 13-member council and full-time city manager.
   Residents of the city, which calls itself America's Hometown,
voted 4,019 to 3,354 Saturday to keep the current form of
government, in which more than 100 town meeting representatives
govern a board of five selectmen.
   Proponents and opponents of the measure agree, however, that
some governmental changes might be necessary in the town where the
Mayflower landed.
   William Nolan, a former board of selectmen chairman who
spearheaded the drive to change the town's charter, said town
meetings were inefficient and no longer adequately served the needs
of the growing town.
   ``I don't think people are getting their dollar's worth from
government with this system,'' Nolan said Sunday. ``No one has said
change isn't necessary.''
   The town's population has grown from 18,000 in 1970 to about
45,000 today.
   David Malaguti, who served nine years as a selectman, called the
charges of inefficiency ``baloney.''
   ``I've never seen an issue come before the town that couldn't be
acted on quickly enough,'' he said.
   But Malaguti agreed a town administrator might be needed,
although he said the basic town meeting format should remain
unchanged.
   While Plymouth's present system of government can be traced back
to the first town meetings held in 1636, it has been updated
through the years.
   Rather than having town meetings in which all citizens could
show up to vote, eight town representatives are elected in
non-partisan races in each of 13 precincts.
   The 104-person body meets at least annually to approve major
decisions proposed by five selectmen, who are elected by voters.
Selectmen gather biweekly to oversee city operations.

   Lithuanians prepared a hero's farewell today for a
countryman who burned himself to death in Moscow last week to
protest the Kremlin's opposition to Lithuanian independence,
residents said.
   It was unclear today whether Moscow would ease its economic
blockade of the breakaway Baltic republic, as reported over the
weekend.
   Official Vilnius Radio said Sunday the Soviet Union was
increasing natural gas supplies to a large fertilizer plant at
Jonova, but officials later said no additional supply had been
received.
   In a bid to pressure Lithuania, the Soviet Union has shut off
all oil supplies and cut shipments of many manufactured goods, raw
materials and food items. Natural gas was cut to about 16 percent
of normal deliveries.
   As Soviets began celebrating the May Day holiday, there appeared
little movement toward settling the dispute over Lithuania's March
11 declaration of independence. The holiday is celebrated today and
Tuesday.
   The body of Stanislovas Jamaitis, 52, was to be flown to Vilnius
from Moscow this afternoon, and mourned in an evening gathering and
religious service on Cathdral Square, said Lithuanian journalist
Vilius Kavaliauskas.
   Lithuanian radio and television broadcast announcements of the
memorial service for Jamaitis, said Aurimas Drizhus, a spokesman
for the information department of the Sajudis political movement.
   Lithuanian leaders were likely to speak at the ceremony on
Cathedral Square, Drizhus said.
   Jamaitis will be buried Wednesday in his home village of
Ezherelis near Kaunas, the republic's second city, he said.
   In a TV broadcast today, Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis discouraged other citizens from taking actions like
that of Jamaitis, Drizhus said.
   Jamaitis died Thursday of burns he received when he doused
himself with gasoline and set fire to himself in front of Moscow's
Bolshoi Theater. The theater is located in downtown Moscow near the
Kremlin and Red Square.
   The suicide recalled the self-immolation of Lithuanian student
Roman Kalanta in Kaunas in 1971. Kalanta became a martyr of
Lithuanian nationalism in the 1970s and 1980s, and the independence
movement appeared to be preparing a similar role for Jamaitis.
   In the text of Jamaitis' suicide note, released in Lithuania
Friday, he said: ``Lithuanians will not live in a Lithuania that is
not independent.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Phantom of the Opera'' fans bid farewell to
Tony award-winning actor Michael Crawford as the man behind the
mask gave his last stage performance of the show after a 3{-year
run.
   The spotlight sparkled off his ivory-colored mask when the
British actor walked on stage at the Ahmanson Theater on Sunday
before his matinee finale. A thunderous ovation erupted.
   ``I am so glad this has happened to me,'' Crawford said, raising
his arms high overhead.
   His impending departure created an unprecedented demand for
tickets from fans all over the country. Some staged overnight box
office vigils hoping to buy tickets made available after any
canceled reservations.
   ``Phantom'' freaks who had already seen the production as many
as 60 times reportedly were among those wanting in. Scalpers
demanded as much as $1,100.
   Hours before the matinee, hopeful fans walked around with crude
hand-drawn signs saying ``Desperately Need 1 Ticket'' and ``Please,
2 tickets.''
   More than 100 people stood by sadly in the cancellation line as
fashionably dressed ticket-holders walked inside.
   The performance marked the end of Crawford's theater stint as
the murderous but romantic madman who terrorizes the Paris Opera
House in Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit musical.
   But Crawford's not through crooning behind a mask. He plans to
take an extended vacation before returning to London to start work
on the film version of ``Phantom.'' He began the role in London in
the fall of 1986.
   The role vaulted him to stardom and earned him numerous awards,
including a Tony. In Los Angeles, he will be replaced in the title
role by Robert Guillaume, star of the old television series
``Benson.''

<HEAD>`Goddess of Democracy' Due in Singapore Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ship planning to beam pro-democracy
broadcasts to China is due to arrive in Singapore on Wednesday, a
spokesman said today.
   The 1,200-ton Goddess of Democracy had been scheduled to arrive
in Singapore on April 23. It sailed from France on March 17.
   ``We have been in contact with the vessel during the weekend. It
encountered bad weather and storms on its way to Singapore,'' said
Fabrice Rebois, a spokesperson for the ship's sponsors, in a
telephone interview from Paris.
   The ship is named after the Goddess of Democracy statue erected
by pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square last
spring. It was destroyed when troops suppressed the protests last
June. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were killed during
the crackdown.
   The Chinese government has voiced strong objections about the
ship, which plans to broadcast music, news and pro-democracy
reports from international waters off the coast of China.
   Rebois said the ship had received permission to pick up supplies
in Singapore.
   He refused to disclose ``for security reasons'' when the ship
planned to leave Singapore and arrive in Taiwan for a scheduled
refueling stop before starting its broadcasts.
   The Goddess of Democracy is sponsored by a coalition of groups
headed by the French news magazine Actuel. It has the backing of
the Federation for a Democratic China, a Paris-based Chinese
dissident organization.
   China has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the
planned broadcasts. It has also called Taiwan's plan to help the
ship ``an open provocation'' against the Chinese Communist
government in Beijing.
   ``The activities of this ship are aimed at subverting the
people's government and are against the norms of international
relations,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said at
a news conference in Beijing April 19.
   ``Therefore we cannot tolerate the support of that ship,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Bush Friend, Former Ambassador Didn't Disclose Development Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fred M. Zeder II, a close friend of President
Bush, says he wasn't required to tell the government that he'd set
up a private company to do business in the Pacific islands while he
was a U.S. ambassador to the region in 1986.
   ``There was no conflict between my official duties and my
personal activities,'' Zeder said in a recent interview. He is now
the head of the government's Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   Zeder, who left the State Department in January 1987 three
months after setting up his Honolulu-based company, said he didn't
disqualify himself from making decisions as ambassador that could
have affected his business because there was no legal requirement
to do so.
   Zeder publicly revealed his company Island Development
Foundation in a financial disclosure form he filed in March 1989
when nominated for the OPIC job.
   He neglected to disclose his involvement in Island Development
in the financial disclosure form he filed in May 1987 when he left
his position as the President's Personal Representative for
Micronesian Status Negotiations, a position that carries the title
of ambassador.
   The form requires filers to ``report your agreements for future
employment.'' Zeder already had been president of the foundation
for three months when he signed the form.
   A State Department ethics officer, speaking on condition he
remain anonymous, said the Zeder case could warrant further
scrutiny.
   In general, he said, there are ways to avoid a conflict:
``divesting of any financial interest or not starting one, recusal,
a waiver or termination.''
   George F. Jones, vice president of the American Foreign Service
Association, said the case posed problems because Zeder failed to
notify State's legal office about the company.
   ``There is basis for investigation, at the very least,'' Jones
said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked about
Zeder's situation, said today, ``I don't have any details on it.
I'm sure Fred will take care of that however is the appropriate
way.''
   As ambassador from 1982-1987, Zeder signed agreements providing
a total of $30 million in economic development aid for Micronesia
and the Marshall Islands.
   His firm, Island Development, was set up to ``solicit
participation'' in development efforts in those areas and elsewhere
in the Pacific rim, according to the company's incorporation papers.
   The firm was incorporated on Oct. 14, 1986, four days after
Zeder had signed a treaty providing $6 million in U.S. development
aid for the Marshall Islands.
   Zeder said Island Development advised private firms on how to do
business in the Pacific. He said it never received any government
money.
   But some of the $6 million _ a $1.2 million line of credit _ was
used to establish a ship registry in the Marshall Islands that is
being operated by a private company partly owned by Zeder's son,
Howard Blood Zeder.
   The registry was set up on behalf of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands Maritime Authority _ a local government agency of
which Howard Zeder is also commissioner.
   Howard Zeder declined in the past to reveal the exact financial
arrangements between the maritime authority and Maritime Registry
Management Inc., the private company he heads that operates the
registry.
   Howard Zeder also was a director of Island Development, which at
one point shared office space with the Marshall Islands Maritime
Authority. Howard Zeder did not return a telephone call from a
reporter seeking comment. Fred Zeder said the State Department
approved his son's involvement in the maritime authority in 1988.
   Actual conflicts of interest are felonies, and activities which
give the appearance of such conflicts are prohibited by a
presidential executive order and by State Department rules.
   One federal regulation bars an employee from having a ``direct
or indirect financial interest that conflicts substantially, or
appears to conflict substantially with the employee's government
duties or responsibilities.''
   Another says an employee cannot ``engage in, directly or
indirectly, a financial transaction as a result of, or primarily
relying on, information obtained through government employment.''
   Fred Zeder said none of these rules applied to his involvement
with Island Development. ``I understand that State Department
procedures may have changed somewhat since 1987,'' he added.
   A native of New Jersey who later moved to Dallas, Zeder is a
wealthy businessman and one of Bush's closest friends. They went
fishing together earlier this month in Florida.
   Zeder raised funds for Bush during his presidential campaign,
and he and Secretary of State James Baker III were the highest-paid
advisers in Bush's presidential transition office. Bush nominated
Zeder last year to head OPIC, a government agency that promotes
economic development abroad.
   His name did not appear on Island Development's original 1986
incorporation papers. He concealed his initial involvement by
having his attorneys and his business partner named as directors.
   However, Zeder's wife, Martha Zeder, and his lawyers told The
Associated Press that Zeder formed the company.
   ``Zeder hired the law firm to set up the foundation and I
happened to be assigned to the case,'' said lawyer Alan B. Burdick,
who signed the charter of incorporation.
   Asked why he did not have the lawyers list him on the
incorporation papers, Zeder said he formed it as an inoperative
``shelf corporation'' in case he wanted to do business after
leaving the State Department.
   As ambassador, Zeder negotiated compacts to establish new
political relationships with the U.S. trust territory that is now
Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States
of Micronesia and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas.
   He also dealt with development. In 1986, he signed agreements
for a total of $30 million in U.S. economic assistance to
Micronesia and the Marshalls under two Investment Development
Funds. The funds give grants and loans to encourage joint ventures
and private enterprise in the regions.
   Incorporation papers for Zeder's business say it was established
to ``solicit participation and cooperation in the economic
development plans of various nations, territories and other
jurisdictions in the Pacific Islands.''
   In the interview, Zeder said the company obtained a few business
clients but did not make a substantial amount of money. He said
$123,334 he received from the company after leaving the State
Department was repayment of a start-up loan he had made to the
company.
   The 1986 incorporation papers listed the directors as Peter S.
Watson, an attorney who is now an Asian specialist at the National
Security Council; Ronald D. Howard, Zeder's business partner in a
cruise ship company in Hawaii; and William Quinn, Zeder's attorney
in Honolulu.
   By 1988, the company's business records show Zeder, Martha
Zeder, and their son, Howard, as directors.
   Before Zeder set up Island Development, then-Rep. John
Seiberling, D-Ohio, had tried _ unsuccessfully _ to pass a law that
would bar U.S. officials and their families from benefiting even
indirectly from American money flowing to the former trust
territory. Zeder lobbied against the measure.

   Gordon Moore, 45, and Andrzey T. Rakoczyk, 50, died instantly
when Moore's single-engine plane crashed Sunday near the New

   Moore and Rakoczyk hat about a mile from the burglary scene.
   Most of the stolen items were in the car, Ambrose said. The
violins, both in a single, felt-lined case, were among the
recovered loot displayed by police for reporters.
   ``Obviously, he didn't realize what he had taken. For that we

The violins are his, and he said he practices on them regularly.
   Stradivarius violins, made in the 17th and 18th centuries by the
Italian craftsman Antonio Stradivari and his sons, are generally
considered the finest in the world. Guarnerius violins, made during
the same period by the Guarneri family, are also highly prized.
   Police said they also recovered an antique clock worth about
$2,500, a candelabra, some gold coins and a Persian carpet.
   Ambrose said the burglary took place when the occupants were at

   ``We didn't set the burglar alarm before we went to bed,''
Karkar said. ``But we will from now on.''
   Makarova, 49, rose to fame at the Kirov Theater in Leningrad in

performing modern dances not staged in the Soviet Union.
   She returned to the Kirov in February 1989, performing a special
pas de deux with her partner, Alexander Sombart.

<HEAD>Justices Refuse to Revive Abortion Rights Suit Against Catholic
Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit that sought to strip the Roman Catholic Church of its
tax-exempt status because of its anti-abortion activities.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that abortion
rights advocates lack the legal standing to sue the federal
government for revocation of the church's tax exemption.
   Among those challenging the church's exemption were Abortion
Rights Mobilization Inc., the National Women's Health Network Inc.,
and the Long Island National Organization for Women in New York.
The challengers also included Protestant ministers and Jewish
rabbis.
   Their suit, directed primarily at the government, said the
Catholic Church violated Internal Revenue Service rules by lobbying
against abortion rights and contributing to political candidates
who oppose abortion.
   The IRS generally bars tax-exempt groups from engaging in such
political activities.
   By failing to enforce its rules, the abortion rights advocates
said, ``The IRS has granted the church the equivalent of a cash
subsidy for partisan political activity.''
   Some of the abortion rights groups have the same tax-exempt
status as the church. But their lawyers said the groups refrain
from lobbying and making political contributions, and thus suffer a
competitive disadvantage in the national debate over abortion.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, voting 2-1, threw out the
suit last September.
   The appeals court said the lawsuit accuses the IRS of creating
``an uneven playing field tilted to favor the Catholic Church.''
   But the appeals court said the abortion rights groups lack
standing to make that argument because they are not engaged in
lobbying or making political contributions.
   ``The fatal flaw in the argument is that (the groups) are not
players in that arena or on that field'' but are like any other
``spectator who supported a given side in public political
debate,'' the appeals court said.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Jon O. Newman said the tax-exempt
abortion rights groups are being penalized for obeying the law and
staying out of some political activities.
   ``I fail to understand why any person or organization seeking to
challenge a violation of federal law should be denied access to a
federal court for the reason that it is obeying the law,'' Newman
said.
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the
appeal acted on today.
   The justices previously studied a different aspect of the case.
In 1988, they voted 8-1 to free the church from having to pay
$100,000 a day in court fines for withholding documents sought by
the abortion rights advocates.
   The justices in 1988 overturned a federal judge's contempt
citation against the church, and told the 2nd Circuit court to rule
on the legal standing issue.
   The case is Abortion Rights Mobilization vs. U.S. Catholic
Conference, 89-1242.

   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate
an award of nearly $1 million won, and then lost, by former

   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
Behagen's award.
   Behagen, who now lives and sells insurance in the Atlanta area,
has been battling in federal court since 1982 with the Amateur
Basketball Association of the United States (ABAUSA) and its
executive director, William Wall.
   The organization is now known as USA Basketball.
   Behagen said the association violated federal antitrust law and
his constitutional rights by playing a pivotal role in ending his
career with a Sienna, Italy, team after he had left the National
Basketball Association.
   A federal jury in Denver agreed and awarded him $684,000. A
federal judge tacked on $180,476 in attorney's fees and court
costs, plus interest.
   But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the award,
prompting Behagen's appeal to the high court.
   Behagen was a University of Minnesota star and played seven NBA
seasons before he left to play for Sienna in 1979.
   Even though Behagen was paid $54,000 and received rent-free
housing and other benefits from the Italian team, the league
nominally had amateur status then, and was accountable to the
Federation Internationale de Basketball Amateur, or FIBA. ABAUSA
was a member of FIBA.
   Americans playing in the Italian league were required to have a
FIBA license and a travel permit from the organization.
   Behagen returned to the United States in 1980 and signed a
contract to play a handful of games at the end of the NBA season
for the Washington Bullets.
   When he returned to Italy later that year, he was barred by FIBA
from playing for the Sienna team. Wall had informed FIBA that
Behagen played for the Bullets, and the international group
declared him ineligible to play ``amateur'' basketball in Italy.
   The distinction between amateur and professional status in
international basketball since has been eliminated.
   Behagen also sued FIBA, which settled the case by paying him
$75,000.
   The 10th Circuit court, in overturning Behagen's award against
USA Basketball, said Congress generally exempted the group from
antitrust law by designating it the overseer of amateur basketball
in the United States.
   But the appeals court said that even though the organization has
``monolithic control'' over amateur basketball, it is not an agency
of the government and therefore cannot violate anyone's
constitutional rights.
   Behagen said USA Basketball violated his due-process rights when
it stripped him of the ability to earn a living without so much as
a hearing. The appeals court said since the group is a private
organization it does not owe Behagen the same due process owed by
the government.
   The case is Behagen vs. USA Basketball, 89-1316.

<HEAD>Friends Of Death Row Inmate Fail In Supreme Court Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five friends of an Illinois death row inmate
who says he does not want to pursue any more appeals suffered a
Supreme Court setback today in their attempt to keep him alive.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the five lack
the proper legal standing to challenge Illinois' death penalty law
in behalf of convicted murderer Charles Walker.
   A state jury in 1983 sentenced Walker to death after he pleaded
guilty to killing Sharon Winker and Kevin Paule in St. Clair County.
   Walker later decided to abandon all appeals, saying that he
wanted to be executed.
   Three separate court hearings were conducted, and in each Walker
was found to be mentally competent to waive his right to further
appeals.
   But five friends who sought to carry on Walker's legal fight
contend that the conditions of his death row imprisonment, coupled
with chronic alcoholism, have caused him involuntarily to waive
further appeals.
   A federal judge threw out the appeal filed by Walker's friends,
ruling that they did not have standing. The 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals upheld the dismissal last March 15.
   Walker's friends told the justices, ``The 7th Circuit's failure
to evaluate any prudential considerations in favor of finding that
(the five) have standing ... will permit an execution under a
statute of highly suspect validity before full review by the
courts.''
   But just last week, the justices ruled in an Arkansas case that
all others lack the proper legal standing to appeal a death
sentence not challenged by a mentally competent defendant.
   The five who filed the appeal acted on today are Miriam Wilson,
Nadine Schnurstein, Ronald Barrow, Gloria Abbey-Lyles and Patricia
Vader.
   The case is Wilson vs. Lane, 89-81.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Kill Lawsuit On GM Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to kill a
lawsuit against General Motors stemming from what a lower court
called ``the highly charged environment of large-scale layoffs.''
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the fraud and
misrepresentation suit by 32 former employees of a GM subsidiary in
Clinton, Miss., should go to trial.
   Those who sued had been employed at a Packard Electric plant in
Clinton before GM in 1983 began laying off hundreds of workers
there _ and thousands elsewhere _ in response to a slumping demand
for domestic automobiles.
   The car-manufacturing giant negotiated with the employees' union
a separation agreement under which workers could opt for a
severance payment instead of having their seniority and rehire
rights preserved.
   Under the so-called voluntary termination of employment plan,
the 32 Packard Electric employees received payments of between
$10,000 and $22,000 when leaving their jobs.
   Their suit alleges that at meetings to explain the severance
plan, a GM representative said they could be rehired if new jobs
were created. The employees allegedly were told they would have to
apply like everyone else, without any consideration of seniority,
but would be eligible for rehiring.
   New positions opened at the plant in 1985, but the 32
ex-employees were told the severance plan they had chosen made them
ineligible for rehiring.
   The 32 employees sued in federal court, but based their suit on
Mississippi law claims of fraud and misrepresentation.
   Lawyers for GM sought a dismissal, arguing that the proper forum
was the National Labor Relations Board. Even if a court suit were
allowed, GM said, the state law claims would be pre-empted by
federal labor law.
   A federal trial judge and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled against GM.
   ``The NLRB has no jurisdiction and ... state law governs the
action,'' the appeals court said. It characterized the case as one
``involving alleged promises made and broken in the highly charged
environment of large-scale layoffs and shifts in the labor market.''
   GM then sought Supreme Court review.
   The case is GM vs. Wells, 89-1067.

<HEAD>Court Allows Jurors' Names To Remain Secret During Criminal Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that says the public has no constitutional right to know the names
of jurors while they are serving in a criminal trial.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to a Delaware
judge's order that kept jurors' names secret during a
much-publicized murder trial.
   Lawyers for Gannett Co. Inc., publisher of the News Journal in
Wilmington, said the judge's order contradicts previous Supreme
Court rulings on the public's right of access to criminal trials.
   The Delaware Supreme Court, saying those previous rulings do not
apply to the release of jurors' names, upheld the judge's order
last Nov. 13.
   ``Gannett has failed to carry its burden of establishing any
historical tradition of constitutional dimension regarding public
access to jurors' names,'' the state Supreme Court ruled.
   The dispute stemmed from the Wilmington murder trial of Steven
Pennell, who was charged with the serial torture slayings of three
women. State prosecutors sought the death penalty.
   Pennell was convicted of two of the murders, and was sentenced
to life in prison.
   Before the trial's jury selection began, the presiding judge
ordered that potential jurors be identified in open court by
numbers, not their names. Throughout the trial, only the judge,
prosecutors, the defendant and his lawyers knew the jurors' names.
   The News-Journal had published an article offering biographical
sketches of all the jurors in a then-recently concluded murder
trial, and the judge was concerned the newspaper might run a
similar article during Pennell's trial.
   Jurors were not to be sequestered, and the judge said he was
worried jurors might be harassed during the trial _ interfering in
Pennell's right to an impartial jury.
   Lawyers for Gannett noted that jurors had not been sequestered
in the previous trial, and that none was harassed after being
identified in the newspaper.
   But names of jurors in Pennell's case were not made public until
his trial ended.
   In a landmark 1980 ruling, the nation's highest court said the
public has a constitutional right to attend criminal trials even
when defendants object. The justices since have expanded that
ruling to cover jury selection and pretrial proceedings in criminal
cases.
   Judges cannot abridge that right, the court has said, without
articulating the compelling interests to be served by secrecy.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Gannett said, ``By
cloaking jurors in anonymity, the bond between the jury and the
public is weakened ... Hearing the name of each juror called and
relating that name to the juror's testimony (during jury selection)
insures public confidence that the process is fair and the answers
are truthful.''
   The Delaware Supreme Court rejected those arguments.
   ``Contrary to the rather pietistic claims of Gannett and (other
news organizations), there is nothing to suggest that such actions
undermined public trust in the judicial system,'' the state court
said.
   Delaware Attorney General Charles Oberly III urged the justices
to reject Gannett's appeal. ``The conduct of the trial judge here
did not undermine the goal of ensuring governmental
accountability,'' he said.
   The case is Gannett vs. Delaware, 89-1324.

   President Chaim Herzog called for electoral
reform and criticized Israeli politicians for showing a ``total
contempt for the principles of democracy'' in his Independence Day
address to the nation.
   Several thousand Israelis, including a group of army reserve
officers on a hunger strike, staged a protest rally in front of the
parliament building today to demand changes in the electoral system.
   Israel army radio said organizers of the grassroots campaign
collected more than half a million pro-reform signatures on

   Hundreds of thousands of Israelis, meanwhile, celebrated their
country's 42nd Independence Day with picnics and barbecues on
Mediterranean beaches, in parks and ietitions and pren forests.
   Police reported massive traffic jams along the major highways,
and Israel radio said recreation sites from north to south were
filled.
   This year's Independence Day finds the country plagued by
political divisions and unable to form a strong government since
the March 15 collapse of a coalition led by the center-left Labor
Party and right-wing Likud bloc.

<HEAD>Court Refuses Use Of Incriminating Statement In Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let
Colorado prosecutors use as trial evidence incriminating statements
made by a man charged with the menacing use of a deadly weapon.
   The attorneys general of 22 states had urged the justices to use
the case to clarify just when police must give so-called Miranda
warnings before questioning criminal suspects.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that also blocked
prosecutors' use as evidence of a rifle seized from the home of the
man, Charles Cleburn of Fremont County, Colo.
   Deputy Sheriff Don Adler went to Cleburn's home Sept. 7, 1988,
to investigate a report that someone matching Cleburn's description
had menaced a young man with a rifle.
   Adler and a deputy who accompanied him were uniformed and armed.
   Adler, who was on friendly terms with Cleburn, engaged him in
what a state trial judge called ``sort of a `good ol' boy'
scenario.''
   Cleburn was asked whether he had had a run-in with a young man
and whether he owned a rifle similar to the one the young man had
described.
   Adler then asked Cleburn to show him the rifle, but said, ``You
don't have to let me.''
   Cleburn made certain incriminating remarks while answering
Adler's questions, and later agreed to let the deputy take the
rifle.
   After walking to his car with the rifle, the deputy changed his
mind about what to do. He walked back to the house, asked Cleburn
to come outside and arrested him.
   Prior to telling Cleburn he was under arrest, Adler did not tell
him of his right to remain silent or to get a lawyer's help before
answering any questions.
   Since its famous Miranda vs. Arizona decision in 1966, the
Supreme Court has required police to give such warnings before
questioning criminal suspects who are in custody.
   A state trial judge ruled that Cleburn's comments and the seized
rifle could not be used as evidence against him, and the Colorado
Supreme Court voted 4-3 to uphold that ruling last Nov. 20.
   The state Supreme Court rejected prosecutors' arguments that
Cleburn was not ``in custody'' when he made the incriminating
remarks.
   The state court also ruled that Cleburn had not voluntarily
given the rifle to Adler. By that time, Cleburn ``had nothing to
lose,'' the state court said.
   ``The prior relationship between one of the deputies and the
defendant made the questioning subtly coercive, the defendant was
in custody, and the defendant had already made incriminating
statements without the benefit of a Miranda advisement,'' the state
court said.
   The November ruling was appealed by District Attorney Edward J.
Rogers III and supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief
submitted by Colorado Attorney General Duane Woodward and signed by
the attorneys general of 20 other states.
   Citing general confusion over what amounts to police custody,
they told the court, ``Definitive guidance is needed regarding what
type of `seizure' is necessary to trigger Miranda protections.''
   The 20 states are Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois,
Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri,
New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Vermont,
Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming.
   The case is Colorado vs. Cleburn, 89-1232.

<TEXT>
   Tortillas have a friend in Irwin Steinberg,
who thinks the Mexican staple can be used in all kinds of ways _
just as bagels and pita bread are not just for lox and gyros.
   Steinberg is the first executive director of the newly formed
Tortilla Industry Association.
   His first order of business? To let people know a tortilla can
be used for more than holding together the insides of a burrito or
enchilada.
   ``It may be wishful thinking, but there is no reason why
somebody couldn't put ham and cheese inside a tortilla and sell
it,'' Steinberg said in a recent interview. ``They needn't be
limited to what is considered traditional Mexican food.''
   Bagels broke out of the Jewish ethnic mold, and Greek pita bread
``has graduated,'' so why not tortillas, said Steinberg, 63.
   The tortilla industry passed the $2 billion mark in 1988 after a
decade of rapid growth, he said. Steinberg wants to double that
amount in the coming decade by tapping markets in the North, East
and Midwest, where tortillas are still largely a foreign food.
   ``We have to turn tortillas from a commodity into a delicacy,''
he said.

   Members of the first joint group of U.S., Soviet
and Chinese climbers to attempt to scale Mount Everest left their
base camp today for a second try at the summit, the official
Chinese news agency Xinhua said.
   The first attempt by participants in the Mount Everest
International Peace Climb to reach the summit of the world's
highest mountain was foiled by high winds.
   Members of the expedition, which is trying to promote goodwill
among the three nations, managed to climb within 1,738 feet of the
summit of the 29,028-foot mountain in mid-April.
   They had hoped to reach the summit on April 22, Earth Day, but
winds forced them to turn back.
   Xinhua said six climbers, two from each country, left the
expedition's base camp and were expected to reach another camp at
the 21,450-foot level later today. They hope to reach the summit
May 6.
   A second group of six climbers will follow one day behind them.
   Illness as well as the weather has taken on toll on the
expedition.
   Expedition leader Jim Whittaker, of Port Townsend, Wash., who in
1963 became the first American to scale Everest, was evacuated to
Nepal in early April after injuring his leg.
   Xinhua said an American climber, Laverne Woods, left the
expedition Friday after becoming ill with pneumonia.
   The expedition plans to bring down from the mountain an
estimated 2 tons of trash left by earlier expeditions, including
empty oxygen bottles and cans.

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion leaders, buoyed by a show of
strength in the nation's capital, say their movement needs to focus
on pushing for legislation in state houses around the country to
outlaw abortion.
   Park Police estimated Saturday's ``Rally for Life'' crowd at
200,000, while organizers said more than half a million people
filled the grassy area on a steamy afternoon.
   Last year's Supreme Court decision permitting greater state
limits on abortions seems to have given new political vitality to
supporters of abortion rights, while also raising hopes of abortion
opponents that the court could overturn its 17-year-old Roe vs.
Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide.
   ``It looks as though the court is going to ultimately reverse
Roe,'' Dr. J.C. Willke, president of the National Right to Life
Committee, said Saturday. ``Our job now is to go to the 50 states
... and convince them to pass laws to protect unborn babies.''
   Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, said
Saturday's rally was a demonstration of the anti-abortion
movement's strength.
   ``At least part of the motive is to try to reverse what we feel
is a misperception about the strength of the Right to Life movement
_ and also, to give some politicians who might be wavering a little
bit of backbone,'' Bauer said.
   Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said her side's political and election successes in a
number of states _ and not Saturday's crowd _ are the accurate
measure of public opinion on abortion.
   Federal disclosure reports show the leading abortion-rights
group has nearly seven times as much money on hand as the chief
anti-abortion organization _ $347,000 compared with $51,000.
   The reports also show the political action committee for the
National Abortion Rights Action League raised $300,000 in the first
three months of the year, far more than the $7,200 reported by the
National Right to Life PAC.
   The Right to Life PAC, however, is preparing to launch its
annual direct mail campaign this spring and may close the gap.
   President Bush spoke to the rally by telephone hookup, decrying
the frequency of abortion in America but making no mention of
proposals for a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.
   ``Like you, I realize that the widespread prevalence of abortion
in America is a tragedy, not only in terms of lives destroyed but
because it so fundamentally contradicts the values we as Americans
hold dear,'' Bush said.
   Bush pointed to adoption as the appropriate alternative to
abortion.
   ``Our mission must be to help more and more Americans make the
right choice, the choice for life,'' Bush said.
   ``One day your lifesaving message will have reached and
influenced every American. And until then, continue to work for the
day when respect for human life is sacrosanct and beyond question.
I know from your devotion and selflessness that this day cannot be
far away,'' Bush said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle appeared before the group and called
legal abortion ``a terrible wound which for almost two decades has
torn at our country's heart.''
   Entertainment began early in the day, long before the afternoon
program of Catholic cardinals, television evangelists, country and
gospel singers, and anti-abortion leaders.
   ``I'm here because I feel real strongly that babies have a right
to live,'' said country singer Terri Gibbs, who brought her
6-month-old son David.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. called the other side's ``pro-choice''
slogan a fraud. He said: ``The answer to that is, `Madam, if you're
pregnant, you have a baby! You have a baby!' Nobody should have the
choice to kill an innocent human life once it's begun.''

<TEXT>
   Not too long ago, other Western European
leaders generally viewed Helmut Kohl as an affable politician whose
main concern was staying in good standing with his country's
conservatives.
   Now, with the rapid approach of German unification, the West
German chancellor is probably the single most important voice in
the 12-nation European Community, and a far more important player
on the world stage.
   ``It was still in good taste, even a few months ago, to depict
Helmut Kohl as a man with limited talents _ as a provincial
politician,'' said France's influential Le Monde newspaper.
   ``Today, people are starting to suspect him of wanting to carve
up his neighbors and dominate the continent,'' the newspaper said
Saturday.
   Kohl firmly rejects such assertions. He says a unified Germany
with a combined population of nearly 80 million will serve the
interests of the European Community.
   But there appears to be little question that his new, more
important role is one he relishes.
   In Washington, it was announced today that Kohl will meet with
President Bush at the White House May 17 to discuss the U.S.-Soviet
superpower summit, which begins May 30, and German reunification.
   During Saturday's summit in Dublin, Western European leaders
said they ``warmly welcomed'' the joining of the two German states.
The declaration reflects in large part efforts by Kohl's government
to dispel fears about German unification.
   The 60-year-old Kohl dominated the post-summit news conference,
calling the EC's full support of German unification a ``historic
hour.''
   After Kohl became chancellor in 1982, the frequently repeated
calls of his Christian Democratic Union for a united Germany were
often dismissed as fanciful dreaming.
   Then came 1989 and the collapse of hard-line Communist
governments across Eastern Europe. The political transformation
included the downfall of Erich Honecker, Kohl's longtime nemesis as
Communist leader in East Berlin.
   A little more than four months after the Berlin Wall began to
crumble on Nov. 9, East Germans had given a Kohl-backed coalition
firm control of government in East Berlin.
   Suddenly, Kohl's hopes were rapidly on their way to being
fulfilled, propelled by a powerful business community eager to
bring East Germany into its economic fold.
   But Kohl's rush to greater prominence hasn't come without
controversy.
   For several weeks, the chancellor rattled Europeans by failing
to unequivically renounce German claims to lands awarded to Poland
after Germany's defeat in World War II.
   He compounded his woes by seeking an apology from the Poles for
the mistreatment of millions of Germans forcibly expelled from
Poland after the Nazi defeat.
   But things began to turn around when the chancellor traveled to
Brussels on March 9 to assuage fears among NATO allies about German
unification.
   ``German interests must be taken into account, but also the
interests of all our friends and partners and neighbors in East and
West must be taken into account,'' Kohl said then.
   While Kohl is riding high for the time being, speculation is
rising about how he will fare in national elections scheduled for
Dec. 2.
   Many West Germans are worried about the staggering costs of
unification, and Kohl has been unable to ease fears that a tax
increase will be needed to finance unification.
   The decline of East-West tensions also may help the opposition
Social Democrats, who have been at the forefront by criticizing

   An independent poll in today's editions of Der Spiegel magazine
gives Kohl a 58 percent approval rating. That is an increase of 4
percentage points over a month ago, but way behind Kohl's SPD
challenger Oskar Lafontaine with a 63 percent rating.
   Lafontaine was hurt Wednesday night in a knife attack by an
emotionally disturbed woman but was moved out of intensive care

<HEAD>Court Orders Reconsideration of Taped Evidence In $7.2 Million
Robbery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ordered more study today in
a dispute over use of tape-recorded evidence in prosecuting nine
Puerto Rico men accused of robbing $7.2 million from a Wells Fargo
depot in Connecticut seven years ago.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said a federal appeals court must
reconsider whether all the recordings made during electronic
surveillance of members of Los Macheteros (the machete wielders)
may be used as trial evidence.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that some of the
tapes may not be used as evidence because they were not sealed for
safekeeping quickly enough.
   Prosecutors say members of Los Macheteros were involved in the
Sept. 12, 1983 robbery in West Hartford, Conn.
   Nineteen members of the organization were indicted by a federal
grand jury in connection with the crime.
   Evidence linking nine of the men to the Connecticut heist was
discovered during an investigation of a rocket attack on the FBI
office in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico.
   During that investigation, electronic snooping was conducted at
six different locations in Puerto Rico between April 1984 and
August 1985.
   After their indictment, the nine men sought to have all tape
recordings obtained during the surveillance ruled inadmissible as
trial evidence.
   U.S. District Judge T. Emmet Clarie in Hartford, after an
eight-month hearing, supressed 378 tapes made at two of the six
locations.
   The 2nd Circuit court upheld the suppression order, ruling that
government agents waited too long after the taping sessions had
ended to have the tapes sealed and preserved.
   It found a 118-day delay in one instance and an 82-day delay in
the other.
   The nine defendants are Filiberto Ojeda Rios, Hilton E.
Fernandez Diamante, Joerge Farinacci Garcia, Elias Castro Ramos,
Orlando Gonzalez Claudio, Issac Camacho Negron, Ivonne Melendez
Carrion, Angel Dias Ruiz and Luis Colon Osorio.
   Federal law requires not only that a judge authorize such
electronic surveillance, but also that a judge supervise the
sealing of the recordings to protect against any tampering.
   The law says the recordings must be sealed as soon as the
court-authorized surveillance period ends unless government agents
have some ``satisfactory explanation'' for delay.
   The court today rejected Bush administration arguments that
would have stretched the time in which a court-supervised sealing
of the evidence is required.
   The justices also rejected the government's attempt to waive the
sealing requirement if the tapes' authenticity can be proved.
   But writing for the court, Justice Byron R. White said
prosecutors believed _ wrongly but in good faith _ that they were
not required to seal the tapes until there was ``a meangingful
hiatus in the investigation as a whole.''
   ``The excuse now advanced by the government is objectively
reasonable,'' White said and may be enough to excuse the delays in
sealing the tapes.
   But White said the excuse cannot meet the legally required
``satisfactory explanation'' requirement unless it was made before
Judge Clarie, and not just in front of the appeals court.
   ``Even though the misunderstanding now pressed by the government
was objectively reasonable, that explanation is not `satisfactory'
... unless it was relied on at the suppression hearing to explain
the sealing delays,'' White said.
   The court sent the matter back to the 2nd Circuit court ``for a
determination of whether the government's explanation to (Judge
Clarie) substantially corresponds to the explanation it now
advances.''
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall, although calling the issue ``a close question,''
dissented. They voted to uphold the 2nd Circuit court's ruling that
would have excluded the 378 tapes as evidence.
   The case is U.S. vs. Ojeda Rios, 89-61.

<HEAD>250 Possible Cases of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Reported to CDC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight months into a study of chronic fatigue
syndrome, doctors in four cities have reported 250 possible cases
of the mysterious malady to the Centers for Disease Control.
   About 350 physicians in Atlanta; Reno, Nev.; Grand Rapids,
Mich.; and Wichita, Kan., are cooperating with the CDC, reporting
possible cases of chronic fatigue syndrome, sometimes termed the
``yuppie disease.''
   The study, which began in September, has yielded 250 cases, said
Dr. Walter Gunn of the Atlanta-based CDC. It will be another year
before preliminary results from the study are available, he said
today.
   The CDC is trying ``to determine the prevalence and incidence of
this illness,'' Gunn said. ``Some people think it's increasing, but
we really don't know yet.''
   In the last two months, the CDC has received about 2,000 calls
seeking information on chronic fatigue syndrome, ``mostly from
people who think they have it, or know somebody who has it,'' Gunn
said.
   Symptoms of the illness, first named in 1988 but described in
medical literature back to the 1700s, include the debilitating
fatigue which gives it its name, as well as fever, sore throat,
muscle weakness and discomfort, headaches and insomnia.
   Studies have suggested anger or depression may be implicated in
chronic fatigue syndrome, but there's no suggestion it is an
imaginary ailment.
   ``It definitely exists,'' Gunn said. ``We are finding people who
meet the case definition.''
   The study involves reporting of cases to the CDC by private
doctors. Those physicians do not refer their patients to the CDC,
and the centers are not seeking case reports from the public.

   Engineers fixed a jammed
antenna on the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope early today and
said they were well on the way to recovering full use of the vital
communications system on the orbiting telescope.
   The telescope has not been able to communicate with the ground
through its high speed antenna since the astronomy satellite was
released from the space shuttle Discovery last Wednesday. Engineers
working on the problem discovered that an antenna had been jammed
by a cable.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said that
commands sent during the night ``gingerly'' repositioned ``high
gain antenna number two.''
   ``Successful centering of the antenna marked a major milestone
in the process of recovery use of the high gain antenna system,''
NASA said.
   The telescope has two high gain antennas, which are supposed to
link it with orbiting relay satellites. Without the antennas, it
was impossible for engineers to proceed with the calibration that
was supposed to be started almost immediately.
   Two attempts to use the antenna system were unsuccessful
Saturday because a computer sensed the obstruction. If engineers
had sent commands to force movement of the antennas, the computer
system would have shut itself down as it did earlier.
   Discovery returned to Earth on Sunday, gliding to a desert
landing and stopping through the use of a new set of brakes.
   About 20,000 people cheered as the space shuttle swooped out of
orbit concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. The five
crew members returned home to Houston later in the day.
   The astronauts expressed satisfaction in putting the 12{-ton
telescope in orbit.
   ``We had a spectacular mission _ an incredible opportunity to be
a part of what I think will be one of the most historic events the
space shuttle program has ever figured in,'' mission specialist
Kathryn Sullivan said.
   In addition to correcting the antenna problem, controllers at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., continued the
months-long process of checking out the 43-foot telescope, NASA's
most expensive unmanned spacecraft.
   ``Our hope is that we'll be fully operational within a week,''
said deputy project manager Jean Olivier. ``The first pictures, I
still feel, are approximately a week away.'' Scientific data will
follow in a month or two.
   Engineers working on the communications problem with the space
telescope found that an antenna that should move freely in four
directions was jammed.
   The antenna apparently got caught behind a power cable that had
bowed out from its normal position against the 15-foot arm
supporting the antenna, spokesman Mike Harrington said.
   Discovery pilot Charles Bolden said the results from Hubble will
be worth the wait.
   ``You won't see anything in a week, you won't see anything in a
month that's worthwhile. But over the next few months, the next few
years, you're going to see some absolutely amazing things, I
think,'' he said.
   Commander Loren Shriver guided the shuttle to a 6:49 a.m. PDT
touchdown after a slackening of 40 mph winds that had threatened to
delay the landing. The other crew members are mission specialists
Bruce McCandless and Steve Hawley.
   It was the first time a shuttle used carbon brakes similar to
those on passenger jets. William Lenoir, NASA associate
administrator for space flight, said Shriver reported the brakes
``felt good, firm and comfortable.''
   The brakes are believed to slow shuttles more quickly and last
longer. They may eventually allow routine landings at the more
confined Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., instead of
in the wide-open Mojave Desert.
   Discovery blasted into orbit from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday on a
five-day mission. A day later, the crew deployed the telescope,
which had been waiting to take its place in space since 1983. It
had been delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger
accident.
   Hubble's lens was uncovered Friday, but that action and the
movement of one of the antennas moved the telescope too much and an
automatic system shut down the Hubble's electronics. It took more
than a day to restore them.
   Discovery had been in orbit 380 miles up _ 70 miles higher than
any shuttle has ever flown. The orbit was dictated by the need to
put the telescope above Earth's distorting atmosphere.
   Astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the
beginning of time, studying stars and galaxies so distant their
light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. They hope to
determine how and when the universe was formed, currently estimated
at 15 billion years ago.
   The next shuttle launch is scheduled for May 16, when Columbia
and seven astronauts will carry a $100 million observatory named
Astro into orbit.

<HEAD>Prague Streets Renamed To Reflect Democratic Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of Prague streets were
renamed over the weekend in a move symbolizing the democratic
changes sweeping the country after four decades of Communist rule,
official media said.
   Streets named after Marxist politicians or historical events
linked to the Communist movement were renamed. Some streets
regained the old names they had before the Communists came to power
in 1948; others were given new names.
   The reports were carried Sunday and today by the state-run
television and official CTK news agency.
   President Vaclav Havel attended the ceremony Sunday marking the
name changes at Prague's downtown Palacky Square.
   Havel, who still lives in an apartment on a nearby quay, said he
welcomed the name changes.
   ``As a citizen, I do care whether I live on a quay named after a
relatively unimportant philosopher of the past century like
Friedrich Engels, or on a quay of Alois Rasin, a man who has
contributed to this state to an extent equal to (Czechoslovakia's
first president) Tomas Garrigue Masaryk,'' Havel said in a brief
speech.
   Rasin was considered one of the founding fathers of the
Czechoslovak republic after World War I. Engels, a German social
philosopher, was a close collaborator of Karl Marx, the founder of
communism.
   Some streets had to be renamed several times during the decades
of Communist one-party rule to keep in line with ideological
changes as former Communist heroes fell out of grace with their
successors.
   A main avenue leading to the capital's airport was renamed four
times in 42 years, beginning with the name of the Soviet War War II
hero, Gen. Georgi Konstantinovich Zhukov and ending up as Lenin
Street.
   On Sunday, the avenue was named after Edward Benes, the
country's second president, who resigned after the 1938 Munich Pact
left Czechoslovakia open to Nazi occupation and headed the nation
after World War II until the Communist takeover.
   ``I hope the names we give these streets remain permanent even
if our republic has not been too permanent so far,'' Prague's Mayor
Jaroslav Koran quipped during the ceremony, alluding to the
frequent political changes in this Eastern European country.
   A peaceful democratic upheaval last November ousted
Czechoslovakia's hardline Communist leadership from power. The
country has scheduled its first free multiparty elections in more
than 40 years for June 8-9.

   Two Greenpeace activists scaled the
Georgia-Pacific headquarters building in downtown Atlanta today to
protest the use of chlorine in the company's paper products.
   The two, identified by Greenpeace as D.J. LaChappelle, 24, of
Washington, D.C., and Laurel Greenberg, 31, of Boston, used
climbing equipment to scale about 150 feet up the skyscraper and
unfurled a banner reading ``Take The Poison Out of Pulp.''
Greenpeace contends the use of chlorine to bleach paper produces
the dangerous chemical dioxin.
   Atlanta police Sgt. P.J. Lynn said they would be arrested once
they climbed down, but there were no plans to go up and get them.
An ambulance and a rescue unit were standing by, and police blocked
off a side street next to the building.
   ``They're in hot water. They will be arrested when they come
down,'' said Lynn, adding that the charges would be criminal
trespass and reckless conduct.
   About 200 bystanders, many of them office workers on the way to
their jobs, stopped to watch the protest when it began during the
morning rush hour.
   Greenpeace spokesman Brian Hunt said LaChappelle and Ms.
Greenberg, who were clinging to a cable, planned to stay up on the
building until this afternoon, when the Environmental Protection
Agency planned a news conference in Washington to announce its
findings on dioxins in bleached paper.
   In Washington, EPA officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the report concludes that the amount of cancer-causing dioxins
in items like milk cartons and toilet tissues is too small to pose
a health hazard to consumers, but the agency is concerned about
dioxin contamination of waterways near some paper mills.
   Hunt said Greenpeace chose Georgia-Pacific's building for the
protest because the Atlanta-based company is the biggest pulp mill
operator in the nation.
   Beth Zoffmann, Georgia-Pacific's director of corporate
communications, said chlorine produces only a minute quantity of
dioxin and added, ``We believe our products are safe.''
   Pointing up at the two protesters, she said, ``This creates a
far greater risk than the entire production of dioxin in pulp. They
are creating an unnecessary risk to themselves and the people on
the ground.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CORPORATE MERGERS
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   The court unanimously ruled that state regulators, consumers and
other private citizens may use federal antitrust law to break up
corporate mergers.
   The justices said the California attorney general's office is
empowered by the Clayton Act of 1914 to challenge a $2.5 billion
merger of the Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains.
   Any opponent of a merger, not just the federal government, can
sue to force divestiture in a completed merger, the court said.
   California officials said the supermarket merger could cost
consumers $440 million more a year in grocery bills.
   
   CATHOLIC CHURCH
   
   The court refused to revive a lawsuit by abortion rights
advocates that sought to strip the Roman Catholic Church of its
tax-exempt status because of the church's anti-abortion activities.
   Without comment, the court left intact a ruling by the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last September that the abortion rights
advocates lack the legal standing to sue the federal government for
revocation of the church's tax exemption.
   
   DRUG TESTS
   
   The court rejected an appeal by a labor union and let the
government force thousands of Transportation Department employees
in sensitive jobs to take random drug tests.
   The union, the American Federation of Government Employees, had
contended that the tests violate the workers' privacy rights, but
only Justice Thurgood Marshall voted to hear arguments in the case.
Four votes are needed to grant such review.
   
   GM LAYOFFS
   
   The court refused to kill a fraud and misrepresentation lawsuit
against General Motors brought by 32 former employees of a GM
subsidiary in Clinton, Miss. The court said the suit should go to
trial.
   The plaintiffs had worked at a Packard Electric plant in 1983
when GM began laying off hundreds of employees there.
   They opted for a voluntary termination of employment plan after
a GM representative allegedly told them they could be rehired if
new jobs were created. But when new positions opened in 1985, the
ex-employees were told they were ineligible for rehiring.
   Lawyers for GM had sought a dismissal, arguing that the proper
forum was the National Labor Relations Board.
   
   JURORS' NAMES
   
   The court let stand a ruling that says the public has no
constitutional right to know the names of jurors while they are
serving in a criminal trial.
   Without comment, the court rejected a newspaper publisher's
challenge to a Delaware judge's order that kept jurors' names
secret during the much-publicized murder trial of Steven Pennell.
Pennell was convicted of the torture slayings of two women and
sentenced to life in prison.
   Gannett Co. Inc., which publishes the News Journal in
Wilmington, had challenged the presiding judge's decision not to
identify jurors by name in court during the trial.
   
   
   TAPED EVIDENCE
   
   The court ordered more study in a dispute over use of
tape-recorded evidence in the prosecution of nine Puerto Rico men
accused of robbing $7.2 million from a Wells Fargo depot in
Connecticut seven years ago.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said a federal appeals court must
reconsider whether all the recordings made during electronic
surveillance of members of Los Macheteros (the machete wielders)
may be used as trial evidence.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that some of the
tapes may not be used as evidence because they were not sealed for
safekeeping quickly enough.
   The law requires that recordings must be sealed as soon as the
court-authorized surveillance period ends unless government agents
have some ``satisfactory explanation'' for delay.

   An imprisoned former aide to Samuel R. Pierce
Jr. today contradicted the former housing secretary's assertions
that he did not make decisions or take a direct hand in deciding
who got federal housing subsidies.
   Dubois L. Gilliam, once deputy assistant secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, told a House investigative panel that ``the
policy while I was at HUD dealt explicitly with political
favoritism.''
   ``If you were well-connected in political circles, your
application got strong, strong consideration,'' he said.
   Gilliam, who once was in line to become Pierce's executive
assistant, is serving an 18-month prison sentence on federal
conspiracy charges involving abuse of HUD programs.
   He began today the first of three days of testimony before a
House panel that has spent a year developing the HUD scandals and
was testifying under a grant of immunity from further prosecution.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the investigating
subcommittee, called Gilliam ``the key missing piece in the jigsaw
puzzle'' of the HUD scandal during the Reagan years.
   Lantos asked Gilliam if he would agree with statements Pierce
made in a magazine interview last September and to his committee in
May 1989, saying he never told his top assistants to fund
particular projects seeking HUD grants.
   ``I know for a fact the secretary made decisions'' on HUD
grants, Gilliam said.
   He said that Deborah Gore Dean, once Pierce's executive
assistant, would not allow approval of HUD grants under the
secretary's discretionary program ``without first clearing it with
him.''
   Gilliam said that at his suggestion Pierce ordered a career HUD
employee transferred because the employee had raised suspicions
about a financial commitment for a proposed project offered by a
former Pierce aide, Lance Wilson, who was then working for a Wall
Street investment firm.
   Gilliam agreed with Lantos' description of Wilson's financial
commitment as ``fraudulent.'' Lantos described Pierce's order
transferring David Sowell as ``in some ways the single most
sickening aspect'' of the HUD scandals.
   The New York Times, citing 12 hours of interviews with Gilliam
in Washington and at the prison where he is serving his sentence,
quoted Gilliam as saying: ``Politics was a big part of how HUD
operated, and Pierce was involved in all of that. So was the White
House. There was influence from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   The Times quoted Gilliam as saying: ``Pierce came to trust me
because I was smart. I could remember things without writing them
down. I knew how HUD programs operated and I kept my mouth shut.''
   Pierce has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination in refusing to testify before the committee
probing allegations of influence peddling, mismanagement and
political favoritism in federal subsidies.
   Gilliam's testimony about UDAG grants takes the congressional
investigators into a program largely ignored in previous hearings.
At hearings later in the week he is to testify about grants under
other programs, including several administered directly from the
secretary's discretionary fund.
   ``We definitely will open up new areas,'' Lantos said in an
interview Friday. ``He will deal with projects involving the
secretary.''
   A special prosecutor, Arlin Adams, is conducting a more narrow
investigation of actions by Pierce and other top officials in
another program that provided subsidies for rehabilitation of
low-income rental housing.
   Gilliam received a federal court's grant of immunity, sought by
Lantos' panel, that means his testimony cannot be used against him.
He has been in Washington for two weeks going over HUD documents
and preparing for the testimony with committee staff attorneys.
   ``He has a very good memory,'' said staff director Stuart
Weisberg, ``particularly when you give him actual documents.''
   Gilliam is to return to the federal prison camp at Lompoc,
Calif., when his testimony is complete. Lantos said Gilliam has
received no reduction in sentence or other inducement to testify.
   Bob Plotkin, one of Pierce's lawyers, denounced the hearing as
``a modern version of the inquisition.'' He said Pierce will be
unable to publicly respond to the testimony because of the special
prosecutor's investigation.
   Plotkin said the committee did not respond to his request to be
briefed on the expected testimony or to be allowed to question
Gilliam afterward.
   Gilliam's attorney, Charles Nesbitt, did not return a reporter's
telephone calls.
   Several of Pierce's top aides have also cited their
constitutional rights in refusing to testify before the Government
Operations subcommittee on employment and housing. Among them were
Deborah Gore Dean and Lance Wilson, former executive assistants to
Pierce.
   Gilliam worked in HUD's community planning and development
office, which gave him oversight of the UDAG program and a
technical assistance program paid for through the secretary's
discretionary funds. Former HUD officials have described him as a
trusted Pierce aide, and agency documents show many funding
requests were routed through him.
   Gilliam's prison sentence stems from a May 1989 plea agreement
in a case in which he was charged with steering bond and
construction work for a Biloxi, Miss., project to associates and
relatives who later shared the proceeds with him.
   The charges involved activities while he was directing a
Community Development Block Grant technical assistance program
between 1984 and 1987.

   The vessel that Gen. Francisco Franco
used as his yacht and flagship until his death in 1975 ran down its
flags for the last time Monday in the dictator's hometown, an
official said.
   The 154-foot Azor was built for Franco in the Galician port in
1949. It was last used as a naval flagship in 1984 by King Juan
Carlos, Franco's successor as head of state and the man who
presided over the country's transition to democracy.
   Vice Adm. Rafael Marti accepted the ship's flag, and the local
navy chaplain said a prayer during a brief decommissioning ceremony
at the port in this northwestern town, Capt. Juan Jose Garcia Perez
said.
   The Azor is to be auctioned off by the government, Garcia Perez
said.
   Franco, who was born in El Ferrol in 1892, led a military
rebellion that defeated troops loyal to the Second Republic in the
1936-39 Spanish Civil War. He ruled Spain until his death.

of Christianity and Islam on the continent, the relation of its two
halves has long been a source of tension and violence.
   The middle-ranking officers who launched the April 22 uprising
sought to expel the five powerful northern states from the 21-state
federation. They claimed the north, which has had a dominant
position in politics since independence in 1960, was exploiting the
rest of the country.
   Military sources said 30 people were killed in fighting around
the military headquarters and national radio station. President
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who seized power in a coup in 1985, escaped
and remained in power.
   He responded to coup plotters' charges that he planned to
install himself as life president by promising a transition program
to return power to civilians by 1992.
   Though few Nigerians answered the coup leaders' radio appeal for
support, for a few hours the rebels held the floor on state radio.
In addition to complaining about northern domination, they accused
the government of corruption and said its austerity program was
meant to enrich military commanders.
   Nigeria's media, probably the freest in black Africa, ridiculed
rebel charges the government was sadistic in carrying out austerity
measures.
   But no newspaper denied the allegation of an unfair distribution
of wealth and development between the verdant, oil-rich south and
arid, agriculture-based north. Oil produces more than 90 percent of
Nigeria's foreign currency earnings; the north, at the edge of the
Sahara desert, produces mainly meat and yams, the Nigerian staple.
   ``They drain our wealth with their corruption and nepotistic
patronage just like that oil line rushes our oil from the south to
the north,'' said one southern businessman.
   ``We always have petrol shortages in the south. But you never
hear of cars queuing for petrol in the north,'' he added. He asked
that his name be withheld.
   ``The asymmetry in the production and sharing of the national
wealth has never been so prominently highlighted,'' commented the
magazine ``This Week.'' ``Sharing of the national burden as well as
the national booty must be done with some modicum of fairness.''
   Coup leaders complained about the removal from the Cabinet in
January of two leading southerners, Defense Minister Lt. Col.
Domkat Bali and Internal Affairs Minister John Shagayi. Babangida
assumed command of defense and internal security, leaving no
southerners in key positions and inviting charges that his Cabinet
is heavily weighted in favor of northern Moslems.
   Similar fears of domination led to the coup and counter-coup of
1966 that erupted into the 1967-70 Biafran War. At least half a
million civilians and 100,000 soldiers died when easterners tried
to secede from the federation. The easterners, who like other
southerners mainly practice Christianity and traditional religions,
had accused northerners of dominating the nation.
   Had the latest coup attempt succeeded, the result could have
been another civil war in this country of 100 million, wrote
columnist Richard Akinnola wrote in the independent Vanguard
newspaper.
   Most northerners speak Hausa or Fulani, while Yoruba is the main
language in the south and Ibo in the east. English rule brought the
three disparate groups together. The northerners have tended to
hold power because the Yorubas and Ibos remain split.
   Every attempt at an election has mirrored the friction between
the groups. Even the holding of a reliable census has been
unattainable since independence, since each group claims to be in
the majority.
   The state-owned Daily Times spurned the rebels, saying ``We are
not only tired of coups but also feel insulted by the periodic
emergence of self-appointed messiahs.''
   But it added: ``Sunday's events have once again raised the
troublesome question of the role of the military.''
   The newspaper made no reference to the Aug. 27, 1985, barracks
coup in which Babangida seized power from a military government.

<DATELINE>MASSAWA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet-built MIG jet fighter
screamed over this Red Sea port at 6 p.m., racing down the coast
from the north. Then came what sounded like a single explosion,
followed by a violent shaking.
   About 60 Eritreans _ mostly women and children _ sat in the
basement of one home. It is their daily shelter from sunup to
sundown from the threat of Ethiopian air raids on the strategic
city of Massawa.
   The rebel Eritrean People's Liberation Front captured the city
Feb. 11, three days after launching a major new offensive in its
29-year war for independence.
   A series of seemingly random attacks on Massawa by the Ethiopian
air force began April 4. Two were staged April 22, bringing the
total to six last month.
   In the late morning, a MIG fired a single rocket toward the
city's port facilities. It struck bare ground, toppling a nearby
shed already damaged in a previous raid and causing one slight
injury.
   The evening raid, however, was devastating.
   It dropped not one but two cluster bombs on a poor residential
and market area about 800 yards away across a narrow causeway. A
pillar of smoke rose several hundred feet over the target.
   Many of the children cried in fear as they hid in the basement.
Some of the women were moaning softly or crooning comfort to the
young as the plane flew overhead.
   Except for some nearby warehouses that stored donated grain
meant for famine victims in Eritrea, Massawa's port itself has been
undamaged. About 25 tons of wheat and other foodstuffs were
destroyed in earlier raids.
   ``These raids are against civilians. They are designed to kill
and terrorize the people,'' said Haile Menkerios, an economist who
sits on the rebel central committee.
   The Ethiopian government has denied it purposely targets
civilians, but there were no rebel military installations anywhere
near the scene of the latest air attack.
   Visiting journalists arrived at the scene of the latest strike
just as rescue efforts were beginning. The bodies of dead and
wounded were strewn about. Many victims were children.
   The raid, just before sundown, came as residents were beginning
to emerge from hiding. Previous raids have taught them to stay
sheltered during the day from an air force that usually flies on a
9-to-5 schedule.
   ``They've never come so late,'' said Menkerios of the evening
attack. ``This was deliberate. They knew they'd find people out and
about at this hour.''
   The rebels later said 50 people died and 110 were injured the
night of April 22. That nearly doubled the death toll from the
previous five raids, bringing the combined fatality count to 110.
More than 350 people have been injured, many of them seriously.
   Some of the dead were loaded on trucks. Others were buried in a
nearby mass grave hastily dug by a bulldozer. The city has been
without electricity and running water since its capture by the
rebels in February, and storage of bodies in the heat is impossible.
   The Eritrean rebels accuse Israel of supplying the cluster bombs
to the Marxist government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Both
the Ethiopians and the Israelis deny it.
   A cluster bomb explodes before hitting the ground, showering an
area with dozens of smaller bombs, each carrying roughly the
explosive force of a mortar round. They are particularly effective
against massed troop formations.
   Massawa is one of two strategic harbors that have traditionally
handled most of Ethiopia's trade and international relief supplies
for millions of people threatened with starvation in the face of
war and drought.
   The Eritrean Front has been fighting for control of Ethiopia's
northernmost province since 1961, a year after the former Italian
colony of Eritrea lost its autonomy and was forcibly annexed by the
late Emperor Haile Selassie.
   Rebels hold other towns and villages in Eritrea and, with
backing from other guerrilla armies, are seeking to overthrow the
Marxist regime.

<HEAD>Seabrook Delayed By Third Shut-Down Since Late March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant has been
shut down for the third time in less than six weeks, prompting
critics to converge on the state capital today to call for the
reactor to be junked.
   Officials had hoped the $6.5 billion plant would produce its
first nuclear-generated electricity early this week. But Seabrook
spokesman David Scanzoni said that milestone now has been pushed
back until late May at the earliest.
   Ron Sher, spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee, the utility that
runs the plant, said the reactor was brought to a halt Saturday
night to modify a turbine on its non-nuclear side.
   He said the shutdown would last four to six weeks.
   Representatives from at least five anti-nuclear groups planned a
news conference at the Legislative Office Building in Concord to
talk about the latest shutdown, as well as other events since
Seabrook received its operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission on March 15.
   Roy Morrison, of the Clamshell Alliance, called the plant ``a
piece of junk'' and said the shutdown is another example of why
Seabrook shouldn't be allowed to operate.
   Seabrook, which was originally scheduled to begin operating in
1979, has been plagued by regulatory delays and cost overruns that
drove its owner, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, to seek
bankruptcy protection in 1988. More than 3,000 people have been
arrested in protests against the plant since 1976.
   The latest shutdown was the result of tests indicating that
electrical feedback could cause a 200-foot shaft in the turbine to
vibrate beyond specifications, Sher said.
   The plant began to crank up to full power on March 20, but was
shut down two days later for adjustments.
   It shut down again a week later because of questionable readings
from sensors on the turbine, Scanzoni said.
   Scanzoni, who announced the shutdown Saturday, said that
``testing is all about finding areas where improvements can be
made. We'll take all the time that's necessary. We're not schedule
driven.''

   A bomb ripped through a passenger bus
parked near a crowded fruit market Monday, killing one person and
injuring 10, Pakistan's state-run news agency reported.
   The bomb was buried in a fruit crate strapped to the roof of the
bus, according to Associated Press of Pakistan. A bomb disposal
squad removed fragments of the homemade bomb but had made no
arrests, said the news agency.
   Hundreds of bombs have exploded in Pakistani cities and villages
in the past few years, but the majority have been in the Northwest
Frontier Province neighboring Afghanistan. Afghan rebels fighting
Afghanistan's ruling Communists are headquartered in the province.
   Lahore, the ancient capital of eastern Punjab province, is on
the other side of the country, just 15 miles from the Indian border.
   Relations between India and Pakistan have deteriorated since a
Moslem insurgency erupted in India's state of Jammu-Kashmir. India
accuses Pakistan of helping the Moslem militants, who are fighting
to secede from Hindu-dominated India. Pakistan denies the
allegation.
   Some Pakistani newspapers have blamed a rash of bomb explosions
in the Pakistan capital of Islamabad and neighboring Rawalpindi on
Indian agents.
   Last month, three bombs exploded in the two cities. Several
people were injured.

   The difference between a mistress and a
prostitute will be explored in the trial of a former Playboy model
accused with her twin sister of failing to pay taxes on $1.1
million they received allegedly for sexual favors.
   The twins allegedly spent alternate nights with David Kritzik,
an elderly businessman, for more than five years until June 1987,
when he was attacked and beaten in his apartment by an unknown
intruder. He died last year at age 89.
   The defense won a victory this morning even before the trial of
actress and model Lynnette Harris, 35, got under way in federal
court. At a pretrial hearing, Judge Thomas Curran ruled
inadmissible an affidavit that Kritzik had given a federal agent
before he died.
   Ms. Harris is accused of accepting $745,000 from Kritzik. Her
sister, Leigh Ann Conley, who allegedly received $406,000, is to go
on trial in June.
   The government alleged the money was paid in exchange for sex.
Ms. Harris' attorney, Dennis Coffey, insisted Kritzik gave her the
money out of affection.
   The case against the twins raises questions about the subtle
legal differences between mistresses and prostitutes and income and
gifts, officials said.
   Ms. Harris, of Mukwonago, who posed nude for Playboy magazine
along with her twin sister, met Kritzik in December 1980, according
to court documents.
   She claims to have lived with Kritzik from shortly after their
meeting until the day after Kritzik was beaten, bound and gagged in
his apartment. A lawsuit drafted for the sisters but never filed
said Kritzik's son, Stanley, stepped between his father and the
women that day.
   The 22-page lawsuit was prepared after Kritzik ended his
seven-year relationship with the twins. Even though attorneys never
filed the suit, the government said it can be used against Ms.
Harris.
   An Internal Revenue Service investigator claims Kritzik
characterized as prostitution his relationship with the two women
during an interview from a summer home in Palm Springs, Calif. But
the affidavit with statements from that interview was thrown out
this morning.
   The judge said he suspected that Kritzik took the most expedient
route ``not realizing he might place Ms. Harris in a difficult
position.''
   ``The court is of the position that Mr. Kritzik found himself
between the proverbial rock and a hard place'' Curran said.
   Coffey had argued that Kritzik may have been coerced into making
the statement because the IRS agent showed up unannounced to take
the affidavit. Coffey argued that the statement was untrustwothy.
   Kritzik had told authorities he bought houses for each woman and
gave them access to department store credit cards.
   A federal grand jury indicted Ms. Harris on two counts of tax
evasion and two counts of failure to file tax returns. Ms. Conley
was charged with four counts of failing to file federal income tax
returns.
   For more than five years, the twins alternated nights with the
widowed Kritzik, according to the unfiled lawsuit, which the
government introduced as evidence last month.
   In public, Kritzik called the twins ``my girls'' and said they
had ``nothing to worry about for the rest of their lives,'' the
government alleges.
   Kritzik founded General Merchandise Co. in the 1930s, which grew
in its day to become the largest mail order company in the world.
He later created the Treasure Island discount store chain.
   Ms. Conley, of suburban Milwaukee, has maintained that no sexual
relationship existed between her and Kritzik.
   In the unfiled lawsuit, the twins claimed they were entitled to
damages for breach of contract, fraud and slander.
   Ms. Harris claims to have given up a film career to be with
Kritzik and said Ms. Conley lost earning potential when their act
broke up. The twins, who grew up in Milwaukee as the Moga sisters,
appeared nude together in two films, ``I, the Jury,'' and
``Sorceress.''
   Ms. Harris filed a slander lawsuit in June 1989 against Stanley
Kritzik claiming he destroyed her relationship with his father by
calling her a drug addict, prostitute and thief.
   Another suit filed in Probate Court seeks $5 million from
Kritzik's estate. In 1986, they claim, Kritzik told them they would
each receive $5 million after his death.
   If convicted, Ms. Harris faces 12 years in prison and $625,000
in fines. If the payments were gifts, Kritzik would have been
responsible for gift taxes, which he never paid.

<HEAD>Alert in Manila After Threat of Rallies; Navy Considering Security
Moves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippine military went on
nationwide alert Monday after militant labor groups announced plans
for May Day rallies to demand the closing of U.S. bases in the
Philippines.
   Authorities said the U.S. Navy was considering tightening
restrictions on its personnel after reports that Communist rebels
planned to kill an American near the giant Subic Bay naval base.
   In ordering the alert, Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon canceled all
leaves and passes for the 165,000-member armed forces. Biazon, the
acting military chief of staff, also increased security at
garrisons in the Manila area on the eve of May Day, the
international workers' holiday.
   He acted after the leftist May First Movement, a labor
confederation, announced plans for anti-bases rallies Tuesday near
the U.S. Embassy and outside Clark Air Base, 50 miles to the north.
   Movement spokesmen demanded that the government refuse to renew
an agreement allowing the United States to maintain six military
bases here through September 1991.
   U.S. and Filipino officials are to begin talks May 14 on
extending the lease for the bases.
   In Olongapo, 50 miles west of Manila, a Filipino military
commander said U.S. officials were concerned about increased
security threats by Communist rebels against Americans at Subic.
   Capt. Herminio Abedes, commander of the 164th Philippine
Constabulary Company, said the U.S. Naval Intelligence Service may
declare some or all areas outside Subic off-limits next week.
   Efforts to contact U.S. officials were unsuccessful.
   Abedes said the moves were under consideration following the
arrest last week of an alleged rebel sent to Olongapo to organize
an assassination team.
   Documents taken from the suspect, Dionisio Bendoy, indicated
rebels planned to kill Americans in Olongapo to embarrass the
Manila government before the bases talks, Abedes said.
   Both the Navy and the U.S. Air Force have banned most travel to
Manila by the 40,000 U.S. troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents stationed at the six bases.
   Also Monday, the first trial of soldiers charged in a coup
attempt last December was postponed because the courtroom was too
small and there was no electricity due to a national power crisis.
   The 21 Filipino officers, including two generals, face trial in
Manila for their alleged roles in the Dec. 1-9 failed coup, the
bloodiest of six attempts to oust President Corazon Aquino.
   Chief judge Brig. Gen. Demetrio Camua rescheduled the
proceedings until May 8 after scores of reporters and other
spectators jammed the small courtroom.
   Chief prosecutor Col. Anciano Disierto originally suggested the
trial be put off until May 7.
   Then defense lawyers and tribunal members reminded him that
electricity was to be cut that day throughout Manila because of the
nation's power crisis. The trial date was then set for the next day.
   Defendants include air force Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador and
army Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando. Other defendants are two navy
captains, one colonel, seven lieutenant colonels, three majors,
five army captains and one air force lieutenant.
   All are charged with mutiny, murder and attempted murder and
conduct unbecoming an officer. They face sentences of life
imprisonment if convicted on all charges.

<HEAD>Report Cites Growing Problem With Elder Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 1.5 million elderly Americans are
abused each year, often by their own children, but the government
has ``virtually ignored'' the worsening problem, a House
subcommittee reported Monday.
   Most cases of elder abuse go unreported because older people are
ashamed to admit their families abuse them or they fear reprisals
if they complain, the aging subcommittee on health and long-term
care reported.
   ``Elder abuse has been virtually ignored by the federal
government, even in the face of mounting evidence of its scope and
severity,'' the report said. ``Without meaningful federal support
to prevent, detect and treat it, elder abuse ... remains a national
disgrace.''
   The incidence of such abuse has increased from about 1 million
victims annually in 1980 to 1.5 million, or 5 percent of all older
Americans, the panel said. Only about one of every eight cases is
reported, down from the one in five cases reported in 1980.
   The subcommittee said its survey of states and social workers
found thousands of accounts of abuse, ranging from systematic theft
of Social Security checks to violent physical abuse including rape
and murder.
   Forty states reported that the problem continues to worsen.
   ``Sadly, at a time when the incidence of elder abuse is on the
rise, the Congress and the states are doing less,'' said Rep.
Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee and the
full Select Committee Aging on Aging.
   The subcommittee's report, illustrated with photos of abused
older people, detailed cases in which adult children kicked and hit
their parents, attacked them with knitting needles and knives,
stole their cars, denied them food and neglected other basic needs.
   It said physical violence and financial abuse were the most
common types of abuse, followed by the denial of basic human rights
and psychological abuse.
   Victims are likely to be 75 or older and are more likely to be
women than men. The abusers most often are adult children,
typically a son, and frequently were themselves abused by their
parents when they were young, the report said.
   Among the examples cited in the report:
   _An elderly Delaware woman weighing about 60 pounds was
hospitalized with dehydration, bloody drainage from her knees,
maggots covering her legs, deep purple bruises and a black eye. She
said she lived with her daughter but refused to blame anyone,
saying ``I don't want to get anyone in trouble.'' She died two
weeks later.
   _In Texas, a 69-year-old woman was found tied to her wheelchair
with an electrical cord, suffering from malnourishment, insect
bites and sores. After being released from the hospital, she died
from extreme neglect while her daughter and friends drank in the
next room.
   The report was released one day in advance of a scheduled
subcommittee hearing on elder abuse. The hearing and report were
designed to take stock of the situation a decade after the Aging
Committee held its first hearing on elder abuse.
   The subcommittee called for greater spending on federal programs
to combat elder abuse and provide adult protective services. It
said Congress also should consider legislation to provide federal
funds to states that have mandatory abuse reporting laws, and
called for a national clearinghouse on elder abuse and a toll-free
hotline to collect reports of abuse.
   The subcommittee also advocated legislation to provide
assistance to people who care at home for chronically ill or
dependent family members.

<DATELINE>DEADWOOD, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Larry Shama's downtown grocery store
opened in 1876, the year Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down while
playing poker in this Black Hills gold rush town.
   These days, the food in Shama's Goldberg Grocery is going to
waste. The crowds that throng Main Street are hungry only for the
shuffle of cards and the ring of slot machines.
   The growth of gambling has caught almost everyone in Deadwood by
surprise. Mayor Bruce Oberlander describes the growing pains as a
combination of ``the good, the bad and the ugly.''
   Low-stakes gambling was legalized six months ago. Since then, it
has brought money and nearly 1,000 jobs to a city whose population
numbered about 2,000 before the games began. But it's also changed
the way of life and placed strains on the city's streets, parking
lots and water and sewer systems.
   ``It leaves a person a little crazy, but it's very exciting,''
said Shama, who installed slot machines alongside his food shelves
and soda fountain after gambling was legalized.
   ``Anytime you have an economic boom in any industry, there are
some problems,'' he added. ``But I have more fun personally viewing
this as a challenge, not a problem.''
   The Goldberg Grocery will close for renovation this week,
becoming the latest in a string of hardware stores, souvenir shops
and other businesses to change or close. When Goldberg's opens
again in July, only the soda fountain will remain, along with an
expanded line of slot machines and card tables.
   ``We are changing our style of business in order to survive, and
it's nobody's fault,'' Shama said. ``At first it was a hell of a
decision. Then again, by the same token, I think everyone has to
change because of survival.''
   The state Gaming Commission so far has approved gambling
licenses for 50 businesses, nearly 900 workers and six
manufacturers of gaming equipment, said Don Gromer, executive
secretary.
   In the first five months of gambling, players wagered more than
$74 million, and the gambling halls kept more than $7 million after
winnings were paid. Licensing fees and an 8 percent tax on the
gambling halls' proceeds have provided the city with $1 million,
the state with $164,000 and Lawrence County with $41,000, Gromer
said.
   ``I never figured we'd have 50 businesses out there, and I never
figured we'd have the amount of play we have,'' he said.
   The gambling, which is limited to $5 a bet, started as a project
aimed at providing Deadwood with money to restore its historic
buildings. The city's entire share of the proceeds must be used to
renovate the buildings and city services such as water lines.
   A statewide vote in 1988 approved a constitutional amendment
allowing gaming in Deadwood. The South Dakota Legislature and city
voters gave their consent last year.
   Bill Walsh, owner of the 86-year-old Franklin Hotel, said
Deadwood's gambling industry has grown swiftly because the town
offers visitors a glimpse of the Western frontier, something that
cannot be matched by the casinos of Atlantic City, N.J.
   ``The Old West is alive with gambling, with dance-hall girls,
people drinking and smoking cigars and all the things we've
outlawed. It's got to happen someplace,'' Walsh said.
   Before gambling, Deadwood's economy depended on summer tourists,
many of whom visited nearby Mount Rushmore National Memorial and
stopped off on their way to Yellowstone National Park and other
attractions in the West. In colder months, Deadwood's streets were
virtually bare.
   Deadwood now has a chance to become a year-round destination,
Walsh said.
   But prosperity carries a price.
   Deadwood voters approved the gambling by a 75 percent margin a
year ago, far exceeding the 60 percent needed. The mayor said he's
not sure 60 percent of the city's voters would endorse gambling if
the election were held now.
   While the extra jobs and money are welcome, some people don't
like the change in the city's character, Oberlander said. Some have
moved away because of their opposition to gambling; meanwhile,
newcomers arive daily to work in the gambling halls.
   ``Gambling is a fact of life in Deadwood now,'' Oberlander said.
``We're going to have to live with it. We're going to have to make
it work to the best of our ability.''

   Ethiopian rebels said Monday they had
captured a strategic garrison town in northern Ethiopia and that
heavy fighting was still going on.
   The clandestine radio of the Eritrea People's Liberation Front,
monitored in Nairobi, identified the garrison as Digsa, near Adi
Keyih. Adi Keyia was captured Wednesday. The radio said Digsa was
captured a day before Adi Keyih.
   ``Fierce fighting is raging,'' the radio said. It gave no
casualty figures.
   There was no word from the Ethiopian government on the rebel
claim.
   In an earlier broadcast, the rebels said they had been joined by
1,800 government defectors from three garrisons south of the
rebel-held port city of Massawa.
   The rebels, in a broadcast on Voice of Eritrea, said the
defectors were stationed at Adi Keyih, Cohaito and Senafe.
   The Eritrean Front has been fighting for control of Ethiopia's
northernmost province since 1961, a year after the former Italian
colony of Eritrea lost its autonomy and was forcibly annexed by the
late Emperor Haile Selassie.

   Militant shipyard workers whose
occupation strike was broken up over the weekend fought more
running battles with riot police today, hurling rocks and
firebombs, and sympathy protests spread nationwide.
   In the capital of Seoul, more than 2,000 riot police stormed the
headquarters of the Korea Broadcasting System late tonight and
arrested about 400 workers to end prolonged protests.
   As the police stormed the station, workers locked arms and sang
songs. ``Disunited we die,'' they shouted. Some protested angrily
but most walked out voluntarily and got on police buses.
   It was the second time in three days the government has moved to
put down labor protests with force.
   The police action came a few hours after workers voted down a
plan to end 19 days of protests which began April 12. Workers were
demanding the resignation of a new government appointed president
Suh Ki-won, who they said was against reform.
   The operation of the network's three television channels and
five radio stations continued throughout the protest, but much of
the regular programming was substituted with old tapes and music.
   In Ulsan, workers wearing red headbands bearing the word
``Fight'' set up roadblocks and burned tires, sending clouds of
thick smoke into the sky as they battled police throughout this
industrial city 200 miles southeast of Seoul.
   Police used tear gas to fight off about 2,000 workers who
charged in groups of 50 to 200.
   Two police helicopters hovered overhead, apparently to monitor
protesters' movements and direct police operations on the ground.
All vehicles approaching the shipyard were stopped at a police
checkpoint and searched.
   Elsewhere, more workers and students joined sympathy protests
against Saturday's raid by about 13,000 riot police on the
strike-bound Hyundai's shipyard, the world's largest, to crush a
three-day strike.
   About 27,000 workers of the Hyundai Motor Co. in Ulsan, the
nation's largest automaker, began a two-day sympathy strike today
and workers at several other Hyundai subsidiaries in the city
threatened to strike.
   No overall casualty figures were provided for the three days of
violence. However, weekend reports said at least 24 people were
hurt and more than 600 detained.
   The government has vowed to deal firmly with the turmoil, saying
it threatens the economy. Strikes, steep wage increases and the
rise of the national currency against the dollar have hurt the
ability of South Korean products to compete abroad.
   The shipyard and the auto plant are the main arms of the giant
Hyundai group, one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea with
$4.8 billion in 1989 sales. The group also makes computers, steel
and other goods.
   In the southern city of Taegu, President Roh Tae-woo's hometown,
about 50 radical students shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!''
attacked the city's police headquarters with firebombs, news
reports said.
   Riot police, firing tear gas, overpowered five students who
briefly occupied the top floor of the three-story building and a
radio transmission tower inside the compound, the reports said.
   No one was injured, but several cars parked inside the police
headquarters were destroyed, they said.
   Police in other industrial areas remained on full alert as many
dissident labor unions called for a nationwide general strike on
Tuesday, the May Day labor holiday, in support of the Hyundai
shipyard workers.
   The National Council of Student Representatives announced today
it will step up anti-government protests in the coming weeks.
Leaders said they organized ``blitzkrieg'' squads to attack
government offices.
   The radical student group led violent anti-government protests
in Seoul and other parts of the country over the weekend. On
Sunday, about 1,000 students, hurling hundreds of firebombs, fought
street battles with riot troops in a busy commercial district in
Seoul.
   In Ulsan today, Hyundai car workers, armed with clubs and metal
pipes, guarded the main gate of their plant. Groups of 100 to 200
riot police in combat gear were stationed at 300-yard intervals
along the road leading to the plant.
   At the Hyundai shipyard a few miles away, about 50 militant
workers were still holding out on top of a 240-foot crane. They had
climbed up there during Saturday's dawn police raid.
   Reports said the workers have enough food and water for at least
two weeks.
   Police had spread nets and air mattresses around the base of the
crane, saying the workers may commit suicide in despair. Today, the
workers threw down a statement threatening to kill themselves.
   The shipyard strike began Wednesday over demands for the release
of four union leaders jailed in earlier protests. The company
maintains judicial matters are out of its control.
   Labor leaders say the Roh government is more repressive than
past authoritarian regimes. They also say it has unjustly jailed
more than 200 union activists since taking office in 1988.
   Apparently affected by the escalating labor unrest, share prices
on the Korea Stock Exchange dropped sharply today, hitting their
lowest level since October 1988. The composite index, the main
stock measure, closed at 688.66 at the end of the morning session.

   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega today filed a motion
to withdraw from the case because the U.S. government has frozen
all their client's money.
   ``There are millions of dollars in bank accounts that are
frozen, even though under the government's contention, they are not
subject to the forfeiture law,'' said Jon May, one of Noriega's
four attorneys. ``We are not asking for any funds that would be
tainted.''
   May said the defense has received only ``a few thousand
dollars'' for expenses since Noriega's capture, and nothing in fees.
   He said the defense now needs money to travel, take depositions,
and do research, but lacks the resources because of the frozen bank
accounts. ``But the government is refusing to even negotiate,'' he
said.
   The motion of the four lawyers to withdraw from the case was
filed this morning. May emphasized that withdrawal from the case is
not automatic, and must still be approved by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler.
   May blamed the Bush administration for the decision to freeze
all of Noriega's accounts, rather than the U.S. attorney's office
in Miami.
   ``The government is spending $20 million to $30 million on their
case,'' said another defense attorney, Steven Kollin. ``We don't
need anywhere near that amount, but we may need $5 million to
defend General Noriega.''
   The U.S attorney's office, which is prosecuting the case, had no
immediate reaction to the announcement.
   The federal government has been freezing Noriega's assets around
the world as they are discovered. An initial list following his
capture found bank accounts and property worth about $30 million,
but the Panamanian government has estimated Noriega's fortune could
be as high as $700 million.
   Noriega is currently jailed at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center southwest of Miami on drug charges springing
from a February 1988 indictment accusing him of accepting bribes to
turn Panama into a safe haven for Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   He surrendered to U.S. authorities Jan. 4, two weeks after the
United States invaded Panama.
   His trial is set for January 1991, and it was not clear whether
a change in defense attorneys would set that date back. Kollin said
he thought it would.
   Along with May and Kollin, Noriega's attorneys are Frank Rubino
and classified information specialist David Lewis.
   Lewis was expected to play a key role in upcoming battles over
reams of classified docutments the defense was requesting to
bolster its contention that Noriega was working closely with U.S.
authorities during the time he allegedly aided drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Hugo-Relief: Mennonites Still Labor Months After Hurricane</HEAD>

   Seven months after Hurricane Hugo smashed
into South Carolina, the flow of relief supplies has slowed to a
trickle and the federal government has shuttered its disaster
centers.
   But Mennonites are still helping.
   Farmers, carpenters and professionals from such places as
Newton, Kan., Goshen, Ind., and Lancaster, Pa., are giving their
time and talents to help South Carolinians recover from the state's
worst natural disaster in nearly a century.
   ``We're not here for the glory we get out of it. We're here
because people need us,'' said Wilbur Lentz, coordinator of the
Mennonite Disaster Service's relief effort. ``One of the biggest
blessings has been to see one of these poor people back in a house
and to see that great big smile.
   ``Jesus said that if you see one of these people in need and
don't do anything about it, how can you say God's love is in you?''
   Hugo's 135 mph winds smashed ashore on Sept. 21, killing 29
people and causing about $5.9 billion property damage.
   After the storm, up to 300 volunteers a week responded to calls
by the Mennonite church to help with cleanup and repairs.
   That number has tapered off, but about 100 Mennonites continue
to work each week. Lentz of Akron, Pa., said the operation will
continue at least through year's end.
   ``A lot of our volunteers are farmers and tradesmen and they
have their own jobs to attend to now,'' said Lentz, an ordained
minister and carpenter who has been in South Carolina since fall.
   Officials estimate that perhaps 3,000 Mennonites have worked on
storm recovery _ about one for every congregation in North America.
The denomination has about 325,000 members, whose beliefs include
opposition to holding public office. They also favor plain dress;
but unlike the Amish, who split from them in the 17th century,
Mennonites accept reliance on some modern conveniences.
   Volunteers donate their time and provide their own
transportation, and donations are used to help feed and house them
at disaster sites.
   ``It's very much a part of the faith of the Mennonites,'' said
Sandy Weaver, a spokeswoman for Mennonite Disaster Service at the
group's headquarters in Akron, near Lancaster, Pa.
   Mennonites' disaster efforts were as an outgrowth of World War
II. As conscientious objectors, they performed community service
rather than fight. Afterward some wondered why they provided
service just in wartime, she said.
   Congregations in the Midwest responded to disasters in the early
1950s and the disaster service agency was established in 1955.
   In South Carolina, the Mennonites supply free labor, and
materials are either donated or provided through insurance money.
   ``The most discouraging thing for me is deciding who you help
and who you don't help,'' said Vic Plessinger, a volunteer from
Smithville, Ohio, who has been here since March.
   The group receives referrals from the American Red Cross and
social service agencies, helping those who lack the money to cover
costs of repairs or rebuilding.
   Since Hugo, Mennonites have repaired hundreds of roofs and
rebuilt more than a dozen homes.
   Among the beneficiaries is Juanita Singleton, whose house near
Pineville, 30 miles north of Charleston, was destroyed.
   ``It's a Godsend,'' Mrs. Singleton said of her new three-bedroom
house built by Mennonites. ``I can't even explain what it's meant.''
   A few miles away, in the hamlet of Russellville, Arthur Teives
of Newton, Kan., is busy repairing another house.
   Teives, who has been in South Carolina five weeks, said helping
out ``has kind of been a way for me to serve God. I feel this is
where God wants me at this time in my life.''
   In nearby Moncks Corner, work is progressing on a new house for
William Heyward. He had put up the cinderblock foundation for a
house next door but ran out of money.
   Instead of repairing his old house, which was heavily damaged,
the Mennonites proposed finishing the new one.
   ``You don't know how much we appreciate it,'' Heyward said.
``It's really nice.''
   Lentz said volunteers and building supplies are still needed,
although attention has turned away from Hugo.
   Since the hurricane, Mennonites also have responded to the San
Francisco Bay-area earthquake, tornadoes in the Midwest and
flooding in Alabama.
   And if another disaster occurs, he said, ``We'll be there.''

<HEAD>Charity Backs Executive That Millionaire Benefactor Wanted Ousted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The executive director of a charity has
won a vote confidence from the board of trustees even though a
millionaire had made her ouster a condition for a huge bequest.
   And an official of the charity says the millionaire's
restrictive will may not have any effect.
   Leslie Combs II, a horse breeder who died April 7 at age 88,
stipulated in his will that the Ephraim McDowell Cancer Research
Foundation be given an endowment worth an estimated $20 million
over the next 25 years _ but only if it replaced Linda Mauk as
director.
   Combs did not say why he wanted Mauk fired.
   But the trustees issued a statement Friday saying they had
unanimously voted ``an expression of confidence'' in the
foundation's management.
   ``No further comments will be issued,'' the board said.
   And William Bagby, the foundation's president, issued a
statement Thursday saying a trust Combs set up in 1986 contained
provisions that overrode the wording of his last will.
   Bagby cited a portion of the trust agreement that says it is
``irrevocable and the grantor shall have no power to amend or alter
this trust.''
   Combs' will said Centre College and the cancer foundation would
``each be paid percentages ranging from 1 percent to 99 percent as
determined by the trustees of the trust.'' As long as Mauk was
director, the foundation would receive little money, the will
stated.
   Bagby said the clause about Mauk and varying percentages ``were
amendments and alterations of the trust and contrary to his wishes
stated in his trust that he cannot amend or alter the trust.''
   Lawyer Charles Hembree, who drafted Combs' will and is one of
three trustees of the trust, disagreed with Bagby's opinion.
   ``I don't think I want to comment other than to say I do not
agree with his interpretation,'' Hembree said.
   Combs' will said that if the foundation, or anyone acting for
it, tried to change the will, 100 percent of the annuity should go
to Centre College.
   Combs, founder of Spendthrift Farm, one of the major horse
breeding establishments in the Lexington area, attended Centre
College, in Danville.

   The Supreme Court on Monday killed an effort
to strip the Roman Catholic Church of its tax-exempt status because
of its anti-abortion activities.
   The justices let stand a ruling that abortion rights advocates
lack the proper legal standing to sue the federal government for
revocation of the church's tax exemption.
   The much-publicized 1980 suit, directed primarily at the
government, said the Catholic Church violates Internal Revenue
Service rules by lobbying against abortion rights and contributing
to political candidates who oppose abortion.
   In other action, the court:
   _Gave state governments and consumers a potential pocketbook
victory by ruling unanimously in a California case that they may
use federal antitrust law to break up corporate mergers.
   _Let the government force thousands of Transportation Department
employees to take random drug tests. The court, without comment,
rejected arguments that such tests violate privacy rights.
   _Left intact a Delaware court's ruling that the public has no
constitutional right to know the names of jurors while they are
serving in a criminal trial.
   _Ruled unanimously that the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey may be sued in federal court.
   _Ordered more study in a dispute over the use of certain
evidence in the trial of nine Puerto Rico men accused of robbing
$7.2 million from a Wells Fargo depot in West Hartford, Conn.,
seven years ago.
   The lawsuit attacking the Catholic Church's anti-abortion role
contended that the IRS, by failing to enforce its rules, ``has
granted the church the equivalent of a cash subsidy for partisan
political activity.''
   The IRS generally bars tax-exempt groups from engaging in
lobbying and contributing to political candidates.
   Some of the abortion rights groups have the same tax-exempt
status as the church, but their lawyers said the groups refrain
from lobbying and making political contributions _ and thus suffer
a competitive disadvantage in the national debate over abortion.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, voting 2-1, threw out the
suit last September, saying the fact that abortion rights advocates
refrain from such activities is precisely why they lack legal
standing.
   The justices previously had studied a different aspect of the
case. In 1988, they voted 8-1 to free the church from having to pay
$100,000 a day in court fines for withholding documents sought by
the abortion rights advocates.

   A 58-year-old festival at
California Polytechnic State University was canceled
``indefinitely'' today after two days of pitched battles between
revelers and police led to 110 arrests.
   University President Warren Baker made the announcement after a
morning meeting with Mayor Ron Dunin.
   On Friday and Saturday nights, partygoers hurled rocks and
bottles at officers, who used tear gas and fire hoses to disperse
crowds.
   Fourteen officers and about 50 celebrators were injured. One
student was in stable condition at a local hospital with a serious
head injury. Numerous homes and vehicles were damaged.
   The Poly Royal festival originally showcased student
achievements, but had become increasingly rowdy over the past few
years as parties and entertainment were added to the activities.
   The Poly Royal attracted 100,000 people to the campus next to
the central coast city of 40,000, said university spokesman Don
McCaleb.
   ``It was incredibly chaotic,'' said senior Heather Wicka of one
weekend confrontation. ``There were masses of people lined up. They
were standing on cars, they were standing on the street. They were
climbing telephone poles, street signs, until they knocked all the
street signs down. It was a shark-feeding frenzy.''
   During the worst of the disturbances Friday night, windows at a
liquor store were smashed and terrified employees threw full
champagne bottles at a crowd shouting ``Free beer! Free beer!''
while trying to get in. The crowd returned fire with empty beer
bottles.
   The confrontations between revelers and authorities began when
police and paramedics went to a car accident near the campus and
found a large crowd, which began tossing rocks and bottles.
   Confrontations broke out in several other locations as well.
   Police warned revelers at one confrontation: ``Assault on police
officers will not look good on your resume!'' said freshman Heath
Patton.
   There were 30 arrests Friday and 80 on Saturday, when police
called in more officers, including city police, county sheriff's
deputies, the California Highway Patrol and university police.

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor,
hospitalized three weeks with pneumonia, had a good weekend and has
started poring over the thousands of cards and letters from
well-wishers, her publicist said Monday.
   ``She's doing fine,'' spokeswoman Chen Sam said.
   Miss Taylor, 58, who was reported near death the previous
weekend, was moved Thursday to a private room after an 10-day stay
in intensive care at St. Johns Hospital and Health Center.
   Doctors gave no indication when Miss Taylor could leave the
hospital and continue recuperating at her Beverly Hills home, Ms.
Sam said.
   The Oscar-winning star has started to read messages from
well-wishers.
   ``She's beginning to look at some of them, but the doctors are
concerned that she get a lot of rest,'' Ms. Sam said. ``There is an
unbelievable amount of interest. They (cards and letters) are
coming in the masses.''
   Last week, the hospital released a statement on Miss Taylor's
behalf thanking fans and friends for their cards and letters during
her hospitalization.

   Oprah Winfrey isn't ready for marriage _ and
she should know.
   ``I've done so many shows about marriage and divorce and
relationships that have failed,'' the host of her own syndicated
talk show said in this week's TV Guide. ``I know it would be
foolish to think you can have it all in one time.
   ``I think you can have it all. You just can't have it all at
once.''
   Not that Winfrey is unhappy with her beau, Stedman Graham.
   ``I can't imagine or think of _ nor have I seen or experienced _
anybody who would be more ideal for me,'' she said.
   But marriage, she said, is ``a whole different responsibility
that I can't handle right now. Now, I feel like he has his life, I
have my life. It's fine just like it is.''

   Eileen Fulton, who plays that nasty,
oft-married character Lisa Mitchell on the CBS soap opera ``As the

1970s.
   Fulton, a 30-year veteran of the show, inserted a ``granny
clause'' that kept her television son, Tom, from having children.
   ``Soap opera grandmothers had periwinkle-blue hair, wore support
hose and listened to everybody else's problems. I was not about to
find myself in that category,'' Fulton said in this week's TV Guide.
   Fulton, 56, enjoys her star status and popularity.
   ``I've always maintained a standard of glamour because I'm sick

   Soviet ballerina Natalia Makarova and her
husband have their 18th-century violins back, including the
Stradivarius that was snatched in a daring burglary at their house.
   Police on Sunday evening arrested Robert Fisher, 27, of San
Francisco. He was scheduled for arraignment.
   The recovered Stradivarius was worth more than $1 million. The
other violin, a Guarnerius, was valued at about $1 million, police
spokesman David Ambrose said.
   The violins, jewelry and a pair of Chinese enameled statuettes
were among items stolen Saturday from the home of Makarova and her
husband, Edward Karkar. Makarova, 49, recently retired from the
American Ballet Theatre.
   The couple's 1986 Mercedes-Benz also was stolen. Police said
Fisher was arrested as he walked away from the car after parking it
about a mile from the house. Most of the stolen items were in the
car, Ambrose said.
   ``Obviously, he didn't realize what he had taken. For that we
can be thankful,'' said Karkar. The violins are his, and he said he
practices on them regularly.
   Stradivarius violins, made by the Italian craftsman Antonio
Stradivari and his sons, are generally considered the finest in the
world. Guarnerius violins, made during the same period by the
Guarneri family, are also highly prized.

   The mayoral campaign has taken on a
Wild West aspect, with fisticuffs creating a new campaign slogan:
the town just isn't big enough for the two of us.
   ``We're in a rather heated campaign here,'' said Gary Acker, a
mayoral candidate in this Dallas suburb.
   Acker was arrested and released on $500 bond Saturday after
slugging former city council member John Todd, who was working at a
shopping mall campaign booth for Mayor Rick Lust. Acker faces a
misdemeanor assault charge, police said.
   Acker, 57, said his wife pointed out what they believed were
inaccuracies in some of Lust's campaign literature and he got into
a shouting match with Todd.
   ``He bumped me, and got about 2 inches from my face,'' Acker
said.
   Acker said he feared for his own safety because ``he's
threatened to take me outside before, on at least two occasions.''
   ``The man was threatening to do me some bodily harm, so I took a
poke at him,'' said Acker, who also was a city council member for a
short period.
   Todd, 53, said he regrets that bystanders quickly grabbed the
two men.
   ``They held us apart, unfortunately,'' he said.
   ``I'm not a fighter,'' Todd added. ``But two of us in town _
there just doesn't seem to be enough room.''
   Todd suffered a cut on his forehead. Acker bruised his hand.
   Police Sgt. Art Wiltsie said officers were told the punch was
unprovoked, but Acker maintains he is considering asking police to
file charges against Todd.
   But Acker said he has mixed feelings. ``When we're not talking
politics, I kind of like the guy,'' he said.
   He doesn't think many voters will consider his actions untoward.
   ``Texas politics have always been kind of a wild frontier,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Greek Parliament Fails to Elect New President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament failed to elect a new president
Monday when none of the three candidates received the required
three-fifths majority of votes.
   Former President Constantine Caramanlis, who has the support of
the governing New Democracy Party, was expected to be elected to a
five-year term.
   In the first round of voting, Caramanlis received 149 of the 294
votes cast. He needed 180 votes in the 300-member Parliament to win
election to the largely ceremonial post.
   Yannis Alevras, the candidate of the opposition Panhellenic
Socialist Movement, or PASOK, received 123 votes, while the
Communists' candidate, Constantine Despotopoulous, got 21 votes.
One deputy abstained and six were absent.
   The 83-year-old Caramanlis is likely to be elected in the next
round of voting scheduled Friday. Only 151 votes are required in
round No. 2.
   If he again fails to be elected, the contest will be decided by
a third vote in which the candidate winning the most votes is
elected.
   New Democracy holds 150 seats in Parliament and has the support
of a small right-wing party's lone deputy. Two New Democracy
deputies were among those absent for Monday's vote.
   PASOK and the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress
have said they will not support Caramanlis because he represents
the conservative New Democracy Party.
   After seven years of military rule ended in 1974, Caramanlis
became the country's first prime minister and founded the New
Democracy Party.
   He served as president from 1980 to 1985, resigning after the
governing socialist government reneged on a promise to support his
bid for re-election.
   Christos Sartzetakis was elected president with the backing of
the communists and socialists, but failed to win re-election to a
new five-year term earlier this year when New Democracy deputies
abstained in the voting.
   In the April 8 elections, New Democracy emerged with a small
majority in Parliament and formed a new government under Prime
Minister Constantine Mitsotakis.

<TEXT>
   The average salary of classroom teachers will
pass the $30,000 mark for the first time this year but the gap in
teachers' pay among states is still huge, the National Education
Association said Monday.
   The NEA figures, taken from ``Estimates of School Statistics,
1989-90'' and slated to be published later this month, showed that
the average teacher salary across the country rose to $31,304 for
the 1989-90 school year. That is 5.9 percent higher in current
dollars than the previous year's revised figure of $29,547.
   Alaska had the highest state salary average with $43,153, while
South Dakota showed the lowest at $21,300 _ more than a 100 percent
gap. The dollar gap has grown from $15,360 in 1979-80 to $21,853 in
1989-90.
   NEA President Keith Geiger said he is disturbed by the average
wage level and the ``unevenness of the school finance picture
across the country.''
   ``While teacher salaries climbed past the $30,000 mark for the
first time, this is still not an adequate wage for the professional
services teachers perform,'' said Geiger. He said more than half of
all teachers hold a master's degree or a six-year diploma.
   Teachers also have an average of 15 years in the classroom, he
said.
   According to the study, the current dollar increases in salary
over the years since 1969-70 appear substantial _ from $8,626 in
1969-70 to the current $31,304 estimate _ an increase of $22,678 in
unadjusted terms. When the effects of price inflation are taken
into account, the NEA said the average teacher salary grows by only
$1,521, or 8.3 percent, over the period.
   Besides Alaska, other states with the highest salaries are
Connecticut at $40,496, California at $38,996 and New York at
$38,800. Other states with the lowest salaries are Arkansas,
$22,009; West Virginia, $22,842; and Louisiana, $22,993.
   Geiger stressed ``the need for equity'' and said that goal
``requires that additional financial resources be distributed so as
to even out access to educational opportunity among school
districts and states.''
   The NEA reported average teacher salaries for each state and the
District of Columbia, from highest to lowest, as follows:
   Alaska, $43,153; Connecticut, $40,496; California, $38,996; New
York, $38,800; Washington, D.C., $36,450; Maryland, $36,092; Rhode
Island, $36,057; New Jersey, $36,030; Michigan, $36,010;
Massachusetts, $34,225; and Delaware, $33,480.
   Also, Illinois, $33,014; Pennsylvania, $32,809; Wisconsin,
$32,320; Minnesota, $32,190; Hawaii, $32,047; Ohio, $31,170;

   A bomb exploded on a crowded bus on the
outskirts of New Delhi on Monday night, killing four people and
seriously injuring 28, the United News of India said.
   Police suspected the bomb was planted by Sikh extremists, the
news agency said.
   United News said about 60 people were aboard the bus when the
bomb went off at about 7:40 p.m. The news agency said the bomb was
planted in the rear of the bus.
   It was the third attack on a bus in the Indian capital in less
than three weeks.
   Six people were killed April 13 when a bomb exploded on a bus
near a depot on the northwestern side on the city.
   On Saturday night, a bomb was detected on a bus parked at a
station on the south side of the city. A policeman who was part of
an investigating team was killed when the bomb exploded, and two
other people later died of injuries.
   No responsibility claim was made in either case.
   Sikh radicals have been waging a bloody campaign for
independence in Punjab state north of New Delhi since 1982. Most of
their attacks have occurred in Punjab, where they are blamed for
the deaths of about 700 people so far this year, but they
periodically launch attacks in New Delhi.
   A bomb also exploded in a passenger bus Monday in Lahore,
Pakistan, about 15 miles from the Indian border. There was no claim
of responsibility for the blast, which killed one person.
   Relations between India and Pakistan have sharply deteriorated
since January, when India began a crackdown on Moslem secessionists
in Jammu-Kashmir state. India accuses Pakistan of aiding the Moslem
militants. Pakistan denies the charge.

   President Bush told Panama's new leader today
that the United States ``will stand with you in peace,'' but said
he was embarassed by congressional delay on a $800 million aid
request for Panama and Nicaragua.
   Bush chastized Congress for not moving quicker on his aid
package after a White House meeting with President Guillermo Endara.
   ``I've asked and asked again that our aid package to the newly
liberated people of Panama be passed and passed swiftly. And still
it waits,'' Bush said in joint remarks with Endara at the
conclusion of their meeting.
   ``It is time to finish the job. Just as you can't cross a chasm
in two small steps, the people of Panama can't hope to make the
leap to liberty and prosperity with only halfhearted support from
her neighbors to the north,'' Bushs said.
   Bush and Endara also signed four agreements, three on drug-war
cooperation and the fourth allowing Peace Corps volunteers to
return to Panama.
   ``Panama, a nation newly reborn in liberty, can count on the
support of the United States of America. We were with you in times
of conflict, and we will stand with you in peace,'' Bush said.
   Endara, speaking in Spanish, thanked Bush for the U.S. role in
restoring democracy and freedom to Panama. Then, switching to
English, Endara told the president: ``The people of Panama will
always be grateful for the support and friendship of the American
people and for the sunshine of freedom we currently enjoy.''
   He invited Bush to come to Panama as soon as possible.
   ``Be careful, I might just show up,'' Bush said.
   Endara, making his first visit to the United States, was
installed as president under U.S. auspices four months ago as the
American invasion of Panama was getting underway.
   Before the meeting, Bush addressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and called anew for Congress to approve emergency aid for Nicaragua
and Panama. The Panamanian portion amounts to $420 million.
   ``It is embarrassing,'' Bush said, noting that his request was
still pending even as Endara made his first visit as president to
Washington.
   ``It is frustrating to see the Congress delaying its work,''
Bush said, noting that he had submitted his aid request on March 13
and asked that it be approved by April 5.
   ``Nicaragua and Panama quite simply need this aid and we've got
to deliver,'' the president said.
   One of the accords signed by Endara and Bush would allow the
U.S. military to board Panamanian-flag vessels suspected of
carrying narcotics.
   Another seeks to regulate chemical substances used for illicit
drugs and the third agreement would permit the U.S. Coast Guard to
enter Panamanian territorial waters under specified circumstances.
   A senior State Department official drew a sharp contrast between
current conditions in Panama and those which prevailed a year ago
when Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was still firmly in charge and
refused to recognize Endara's victory in the May 1989 presidential
elections.
   The Noriega-controlled electoral tribunal threw out the results,
creating a constitutional crisis.
   The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Endara's
legitimacy is increasingly recognized both in Panama and
internationally even though he assumed his duties as a direct
result of military intervention.
   Noriega is awaiting trial in Florida on drug trafficking
charges. The military establishment he headed for six years has
been stripped of its Noriega loyalists and is now under civilian
authority. Force levels have been reduced from 16,000 to 10,000 and
Panama can look to a more democratic future.
   The official said most economic indicators, including private
investment levels, suggest the country is on the way to recovery
after a long period of decline.
   Other officials, however, said unemployment levels are
dangerously high, creating the possibility of renewed unrest.
   Endara, at a stop Sunday in Miami on his way to Washington,
suggested the rebuilding nation may need more than the $420 million
in aid that is awaiting approval by Congress.
   ``Panama must be supported by the rest of the world as a living
example for the nations that suffer under infamous dictatorships,''
he said.
   An Endara adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Endara's government had requested $1 billion towards its recovery.
   During his five-day trip to Washington and New York, Endara will
also meet with officials from the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 2,000 riot police stormed
the headquarters of the Korea Broadcasting System at midnight
Monday to end prolonged sit-in protests that had crippled the state
radio and TV networks.
   In southeastern Ulsan, militant shipyard workers hurling rocks
and firebombs clashed with riot police for the third day, and labor
protests spread nationwide.
   Police rushed into the broadcast building holding their shields
before them and surrounded the protesters in the main lobby. The
workers locked arms and sang solidarity songs, swaying from side to
side.
   ``Disunited, we die!'' they shouted.
   A police lieutenant issued orders through a microphone for
officers to take away the protesters, and police arrested about 400
workers. Most walked out voluntarily and got on police buses, but
some resisted angrily.
   ``Although we are arrested, we have won the struggle,'' union
leader Ahn Dong-soo said.
   It was the second time in three days the government had moved to
crush labor protests with force. On Saturday, 12,000 riot police in
Ulsan stormed the Hyundai shipyard to end a three-day strike.
   The police action at the broadcast headquarters came a few hours
after workers voted down a compromise to end 19 days of protests.
Workers wanted the network's government-appointed president, Suh
Ki-won, to resign.
   The network's three television channels and five radio stations
continued broadcasting throughout the protest, but much of the
regular programming was substituted with old tapes and music.
   Dissident labor unions urged a nationwide general strike
Tuesday, the May Day labor holiday.
   The largest radical student group, the National Council of
Student Representatives, announced Monday it would step up
anti-government protests. Radical leaders said ``blitzkrieg''
squads would attack government offices.
   In Ulsan, 200 miles southeast of Seoul, workers wearing red
headbands bearing the word ``Fight!'' hurled rocks and firebombs at
police firing tear gas. Protesters set fire to tires, sending
clouds of thick smoke into the overcast sky.
   Two police helicopters hovered, apparently to monitor
protesters' movements and direct police operations on the ground.
Vehicles approaching the strike-bound Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.
shipyard and other industrial sites were stopped at police
checkpoints and searched.
   Inside the shipyard, about 50 militant workers held out atop a
240-foot crane. They had climbed the crane when riot police stormed
the yard Saturday.
   The workers threw a statement to the ground Monday threatening
to jump. Police spread nets and air mattresses around the base of
the giant structure.
   About 20,000 workers of the Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's
largest car maker, began a two-day sympathy strike with shipyard
workers.
   The shipyard and the auto plant are the main arms of the giant
Hyundai group, one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea.
   The government is taking a firm stand against the current wave
of labor unrest, saying the survival of the national economy is at
stake.
   Labor leaders say the government is using the economy as a ploy
to suppress labor activity and dissent. Their demands are not over
wages but over labor rights.
   Officials say illegal strikes and steep wage increases have hurt
the ability of South Korea's export-driven economy to compete
overseas. Korean exports in the first quarter of this year fell 1.4
percent from a year ago.
   Apparently in reaction to spreading labor unrest, share prices
on the Korea Stock Exchange dropped 4.4 percent Monday, hitting
their lowest level in 18 months.
   The composite index fell by 31.71 points, the largest single-day
drop ever on the exchange, and closed at 688.66, its lowest since
Oct. 13, 1988.
   In southern Taegu, President Roh Twe-woo's home city, about 50
radical students shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo,'' attacked the
city's police headquarters with firebombs, reports said.
   Riot police, firing tear gas, overpowered five students who
briefly occupied the roof of the three-story Taegu police
headquarters and a radio transmission tower inside the compound,
the reports said.
   No one was injured but several cars parked in the compound were
destroyed, they said.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the leftist government
of South Yemen resumed diplomatic relations Monday after a break of
nearly 21 years.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler expressed
satisfaction over the move and said the United States seeks ``a
useful productive relationship.''
   South Yemen has had close ties with the Soviet Union and is the
only Arab nation that has pursued Marxist policies. It also has
been accused by the United States of engaging in state-sponsored
terrorism.
   Responding to questions, Ms. Tutwiler said South Yemen has been
intent on maintaining peaceful relations with its Arabian Peninsula
neighbors and has begun liberalizing its economy and its political
system.
   Its record on terrorism also has improved, she said.
   ``We hope to see continued good relations among the countries in
that area contributing to regional stability and further economic
progress,'' she said.
   South Yemen continues to be on a U.S. list of countries that
engage in international terrorism because terrorist organizations
have been allowed to maintain facilities there and South Yemeni
officials have provided refuge for airline hijackers, she said.
   A new State Department report on terrorism, made public Monday,
asserts that South Yemen has considerably reduced its support for
terrorism since the early 1980s. No terrorist incidents were traced
to South Yemen by the State Department last year.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the issue of diplomatic relations is an
entirely separate matter from a country's record on terrorism.
   Talks on normalizing relations have been held in recent months
by U.S. and South Yemeni officials based at the United Nations.
   South Yemen broke diplomatic relations with Washington in 1969,
alleging U.S. involvement in subversive activities. A decade ago,
the United States provided military aid to North Yemen at a time of
military conflict between the two Arabian Peninsula neighbors.
   Lately, however, the two Yemens have been making plans for a
merger and have set a Nov. 30 target date. In addition, the Soviet
Union has been reducing its once extensive ties to South Yemen.
   Monday's announcement trims by one the small number of countries
worldwide with which the United States does not have diplomatic
relations. Last week, the State Department said it was ready to
pursue normal relations with Albania after a break of more than 50
years.

   Golden tans have been big business
in this desert oasis for decades. Now it's official.
   To obtain an official Palm Springs tan, sun worshipers will have
to baste themselves with the only line of browning balms bearing
city approval.
   Starting in May, bottles of Palm Springs Desertan lotions will
have a small tag with the sun setting over a cluster of palm trees
certifying it is an ``officially licensed product of the City of
Palm Springs.''
   Competing for precious tourist dollars, city leaders value the
name recognition benefits of the endorsement deal.
   ``Licensing is a double plus for the city,'' said Councilman
Tuck Broich. ``It gets our name out in a lot of new ways and it
generates revenue for the city.''
   Proposals for Palm Springs gourmet potato chips, towels,
clothing, dishware, sheets and a board game called Palm
Springsopoly also are in the works, officials said.
   But celebrity Mayor Sonny Bono does not plant to plug the
Desertan products marketed by Greg Ackerman.
   ``That's not part of the deal,'' Bono said. ``I've got to draw
the line somewhere or pretty soon someone will want me to promote
something else and then something else and it would just get out of
hand.''
   Councilman Earl Neel said the licensing deal may generate only
about $2,000 a year, but hoped it could launch a trend of
endorsements.
   Broich acknowledged no one on the council had given Desertan
products the poolside test, saying ``I don't have time to go out
and lie in the sun.''
   But he said the council insisted that Ackerman carry insurance
in case lawsuits were filed against the city by sunbathers unhappy
with his products.
   ``We're not totally crazy,'' Broich said.

   A new species of termite _ a tiny
black-winged pest that swarms in summer and hunts for dead wood _
has been discovered in this Gulf Coast town.
   Rudy Scheffrahn, a termite expert with the University of
Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, calls it
``the biggest termite find in the last 40 years.''
   The recently found termite, which is less than an eighth-inch
long, is called amitermes floridensis. The relatively harmless
creature is half the size and one-fifth the weight of its more
robust Florida cousins. And it's content to gnaw on dead tree
branches rather than 2-by-4s.
   Scheffrahn doesn't know yet whether amitermes floridensis is a
native St. Petersburg resident or was brought from out of state.
   Some 16 termite species are in Florida, and 44 throughout the
United States.
   ``Anytime you find a new species, it's exciting, because we've
come to believe there isn't anything new in the world,'' Scheffrahn
said.

<HEAD>Savings Rate Increases for Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' saving rate rose to 5.8 percent of
their disposable income in March as consumer spending failed to
match the increase in personal incomes, the government reported
Monday.
   But analysts cited rising prices for the subdued spending and
not consumer intent to increase their savings rate.
   ``For each of the months of the first quarter, we had very
strong inflation that cut into purchasing power,'' said David
Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association. ``It's likely to see that reverse itself in the second
quarter.''
   Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
New York, agreed, saying inflation remains the ``single biggest
threat to the consumer support of this expansion'' although he too
expects it to moderate in the current quarter.
   ``That will enable consumers to continue to expand their
capacity to spend,'' he said.
   Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic
health because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity. It has been in the forefront of the economic
expansion now in its eighth year following the 1981-82 recession.
   Consumer spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$3.66 trillion, slowing to a 0.4 percent gain after a 0.6 percent
advance in February, the Commerce Department reported. It was the
lowest since a 0.3 percent increase in October.
   The department said personal incomes grew 0.8 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.67 trillion on top of 0.8
percent jumps in both January and February. The increases
originally were reported to have been 0.7 percent in January and
0.9 percent in February.
   ``The March and February increases in personal income were
boosted by increases in subsidy payments to farm proprietors,'' the
department said. ``Excluding these payments, personal income
increases $24.6 billion, or 0.5 percent, in March and $28.9
billion, or 0.6 percent, in February.''
   Americans' income after taxes rose 0.8 percent in March, the
largest increase since an 0.9 percent gain in December, the
department said.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
rose $14.1 billion at an annual rate after a $22 billion gain in
February.
   The increase in personal consumption, which includes everything
except interest payments on debt, totaled $13.8 billion, down from
$21.3 billion in February.
   Purchases of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ fell $6.8 billion. Purchases of non-durable
goods also fell, down $2.5 billion, while services gained $23.1
billion.

   Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr., in
failing health in a battle with throat cancer, was resting at home
seven weeks after his release from a hospital, his publicist said
Monday.
   ``There has been no change. He's resting,'' Davis spokeswoman
Susan Reynolds said when asked for an update on the song-and-dance
man's condition.
   Davis, 64, was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on
March 13 to recuperate at home from chemotherapy. He was first
diagnosed for carcinoma of the throat last September.
   He was admitted to Cedars-Sinai in mid-January for treatment of
a gum infection and doctors later found that he had a recurrence of
throat cancer. No further chemotherapy was planned.

   President Bush today welcomed the release of
hostage Frank H. Reed, thanked both Syria and Iran but said again,
``We cannot rest ... until all hostages are free.''
   He called the news of Reed's release by kidnappers in Lebanon
cause for joy, but expressed concern about the plight of six other
Americans and 10 other Westerners who remain hostage.
   ``This is a joyous day for Mr. Reed, his family, his friends and
all Americans,'' Bush said in a written statement.
   ``With Mr. Reed's release, we have six innocent Americans that
are still being held hostage in Lebanon,'' as well as the other
foreign hostages, he said. ``Their predicament weighs on our mind
and tempers the joy we feel today.''
   As he did eight days ago when hostage Robert Polhill was let go,
Bush thanked Syria and Iran _ two states the United States has
accused in the past of sponsoring terrorism.
   ``Once again, we wish to express our gratitude to all those who
through their efforts helped in Mr. Reed's release,'' said Bush.
``In particular we would like to thank the government of Syria for
facilitating this release. We would also like to thank the
government of Iran for using its influence to help bring about this
humanitarian step.''
   Bush was meeting later this afternoon at the White House with
Polhill, the rail-thin educator still recuperating from his 39
months in captivity.
   Bush said, ``We cannot rest, however, until all hostages are
free. We urge all parties who either hold hostages or have any
influence over the hostage takers to work for the expeditious and
unconditional release of the remaining hostages.''
   Earlier, the Bush administration today dispatched a special
recovery team to West Germany to greet Reed.
   There was no immediate word from State Department officials on
Reed's condition after 43 months in captivity.
   In Malden, Mass., Reed's wife Fahima said she was ready to
travel overseas ``as soon as I see the picture of my husband.''
   Reed was the second American hostage released in a little more
than a week. Robert Polhill was freed by his captors on April 22,
and returned to the United States late last week.
   Reed's release left six Americans still hostage in the Middle
East, including Terry Anderson of The Associated Press. He is the
longest held, and has been captive for more than five years.
   Earlier in the day, as optimism rose over the prospect of a
release, the White House said it was ``very hopeful'' that a
hostage would be freed. But it it reiterated its policy of no deals
with the kidnappers.
   Reed, a hostage in Lebanon for 43 months, was liberated by
Islamic militants and turned over to Syria, which played a
middle-man role for the Bush administration, the State Department
said in the first word of his release.
   ``We've got confirmation that he's been released and is in
Syrian hands in Lebanon,'' said Kim Hoggard, a State Department
spokeswoman, after receiving word from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus.
   The State Department had kept an open telephone line to the
Embassy in the expectation that Reed, former director of the
Lebanon International School in Beirut, would be liberated.
   Reed was seized in the Lebanese capital Sept. 9, 1986.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater aid the State Department
hostage reception team was being dispatched to Wiesbaden, West
Germany, where hostage Reed will be taken for treatment.
   Amid reports in Iran that the planned release follows
``extensive talks'' between the Iranian government and the
hostage-holders, Fitzwater said, ``We've had a lot of third party
intermediary kinds of messages back and forth with Iran. But
there's nothing we can point to in terms of any specific reasons
for this release.''
   ``It is virtually impossible for us to know exactly the
contributions of Iran in these kinds of matter,'' the spokesman
added.
   He reiterated that there will be ``no deals'' with the
kidnappers.
   ``We know very little'' about the Islamic Revolutionary Dawn,
the group saying it would release Reed, Fitzwater said.
   At the State Department, Ms. Tutwiler said the Islamic Dawn
group ``was unknown to us before yesterday's announcement.'' Ms.
Tutwiler said it is probably associated with the Islamic Jihad, but
added: ``We know next to nothing about this group.''
   ``No one knows precisely what motivates the hostage-takers in
any of their activities, either in the taking of hostages or
holding them or releasing them,'' Fitzwater said. ``There is
considerable speculation that Iran and Syria and others in that
part of the world would like to have better relations with the
United States. The president has said goodwill begets goodwill. And
we are hopeful that indeed that is the case, that they do want
better relations.''
   Reed, 57, was director of the Lebanese International School when
he was seized from his chauffeur-driven car near the Beirut airport
on Sept. 12, 1986, as he was driven to play golf.
   The Massachusetts native had lived in Beirut for eight years. He
is a convert to Islam married to a Syrian Moslem.

   An overjoyed Fifi Reed got the word today
from the State Department that her husband, Frank, had been turned
over to Syrian authorities after nearly 40 months in captivity in
Lebanon.
   The call came shortly before 2 p.m. at her home in this Boston
suburb, where relatives and a crowd of reporters were gathered
awaiting word. Mrs. Reed, 39, said she would wait for another call
from the State Department on what plans she should make to leave
for a rendezvous with her husband.
   ``They have words that Frank is with the Syrians now,'' she
said. ``He's been handed over to the Syrians.''
   The family first got word Sunday morning that a statement had
claimed that Reed, 57, would be released in 48 hours.
   While the Reed family waited to see if that statement would come
true, Reed's 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, said she had never
lost faith that her son would be free one day.
   ``I haven't been able to cry for four years,'' Mrs. Sprague
said. ``Now I can smile and say thank God.''
   ``We have to keep faith,'' she said, but added a word of
caution: ``It's an awful thrust in your side when you find out
these things aren't true.''
   When she first heard of the kidnappers' communique, Mrs. Reed
jumped up and down and hugged friends and relatives.
   ``Oh my God, no!'' she shouted. ``I'm going to die! I don't
believe this!''
   Mrs. Reed was born in Syria; her husband converted to Islam to
marry her. She said her sister in Damascus would try to meet him in
the Middle East, and she planned to travel to Wiesbaden, West
Germany, to meet him there.
   Shown a photograph the kidnappers sent along with the statement
Sunday, Mrs. Reed said her husband looked much thinner and much
older.
   ``I hope he'll be OK,'' she said, her voice wavering. ``But how
can you be completely OK when you've been chained and blindfolded
so long. He'll need lots of love and affection. He used to say,
`Let's have some tender loving care.' He'll need that when he gets
out.''
   Mrs. Reed said she had a premonition after hostage Robert
Polhill's release on April 22 that her husband would be freed next.
   ``But I pushed that to the back of my mind,'' she said. ``I
don't want to be too optimistic. I'd rather be surprised.''
   Last year, their 9-year-old son, Tarek, wrote President Bush
asking for help in freeing his father. The boy's third-grade
classmates wrote similar letters, and in March he received a
response from the president, advising him to ``stay strong.''
   When Bush was asked about Sunday's report, he declined to
comment except to say, ``If that proves to be true, that's
wonderful.''
   Marilyn Langston, 33, one of Reed's two daughters from a
previous marriage, expressed concern about her father's health,
noting reports that said Reed tried to escape and was beaten
severely. ``It really depends on how they were treated,'' she said.
``If you think about being held almost four years without any
contacts from the outside world, there's got to be something you'll
have to go through.''
   Reed made two trips to Lebanon before leaving his post as school
principal in Whitefield, N.H., to become director of elementary
education at Beirut's International College in 1977.
   At the time of his abduction on Sept. 9, 1986, he was running
the private Lebanese International School, which he founded after
his former school, the International College, was bombed out.
   After his abduction, a caller to a Western news agency claimed
the American was a CIA spy and was taken hostage by Islamic Jihad.
That Shiite fundamentalist organization denied holding him and
other callers claimed responsibility in the name of the Moslem
fundamentalist Hezbollah and the little-known Resurrection Cells.
   Reed's family called the espionage charge ridiculous.

   Manuel Noriega's attorneys on Monday filed a motion
to withdraw from the case, saying the government was trying to
sabotage the defense by freezing the ousted Panamanian leader's
money.
   Trying a penniless Noriega ``is like shooting fish in a
barrel,'' lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said. ``The only thing
the general owns at this time is essentially the clothes on his
back.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler set a meeting Wednesday
with federal prosecutors to discuss the issue. Rubino said he
expected a hearing by the end of the week. If the judge grants the
motion, that could delay the April 1991 trial.
   Prosecutors refused to comment on details of the motion, but
U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen issued a statement defending the
seizures.
   ``Nothing the government has done regarding illegally obtained
assets has infringed on (Noriega's) rights in any way,'' Lehtinen
said
   The government has been freezing Noriega's assets around the
world as they are discovered. An initial list following his capture
showed bank accounts and property worth about $30 million, but the
Panamanian government has estimated Noriega's fortune could be $700
million.
   The withdrawal motion said the government continued to freeze
Noriega's assets even when there was no reason to suspect they were
drug-related, and had spurned defense requests to negotiate a
solution.
   The Bush administration ``would very much like this case
disposed of without a trial,'' the motion said. ``We have no doubt
that the administration's refusal to negotiate over legal fees is
in part motivated by its belief that without experienced counsel
and adequate resources the general will decide to fold.''
   Rubino said Noriega had been gainfully employed for 25 years in
the Panamanian military and as leader of his country, and owned
several businesses. He said it was ``ludicrous'' for the government
to say Noriega had no legal assets.
   Defense attorney say they have received only a few thousand
dollars from private sources for expenses since Noriega's capture,
and nothing for their fees. Rubino said he needs $20,000 a month
just to cover office expenses, and because of the complexity of the
drug-smuggling trial, cannot handle other cases.
   The court could order the defense to continue, but the fixed
$40-per-hour rate would not pay even minimal costs, he said.
   The motion said the defense needs money to travel, take
depositions, and do research, but lacks the resources because of
the frozen accounts. The defense wants to hire more attorneys and
secretaries, and needs a team of investigators to go through a
warehouse of documents in Panama, Rubino said.
   ``The government is spending $20 million to $30 million on their
case,'' said Steven Kollin, another defense attorney. ``We don't
need anywhere near that amount, but we may need $5 million to
defend General Noriega.''
   He emphasized that the defense is not asking for money the U.S.
government claims is drug-related and subject to forfeiture laws.
   Rubino said fees in seizure cases usually are negotiated
informally by the prosecution and defense, but on Friday, the
prosecutor's office formally rejected any deal on the fees or
expenses.
   They noted that the issue, according to the U.S. attorney's
office, had been forwarded to Washington after the defense
requested negotiations two weeks ago.
   Noriega is jailed at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center on charges springing from a February 1988 indictment
accusing him of accepting bribes to turn Panama into a safe haven
for Colombia's Medellin drug cartel.
   He surrendered to U.S. authorities Jan. 4, two weeks after the
United States invaded Panama.
   The trial had been set for January 1991, but was recently reset
for April 1991, the attorneys said Monday. Kollin cautioned,
however, that if the defense team withdraws, that date is likely to
be set back further.

<HEAD>New Home Sales Down in March</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High mortgage interest rates continued to
hammer new home sales in March, driving them down 5 percent in the
fourth consecutive monthly decline, the government said Monday.
   ``We're getting killed by high interest rates,'' said Richard
Peach, deputy chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers of America.
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, agreed, saying that ``as long as they (rates) stay up,
the housing market is going to be slow.''
   ``It's not a recession pace,'' Berson said, ``but it's clearly
not a boom period for housing either.''
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 574,000 units in March
after dropping a revised 1.5 percent in February. Sales originally
were reported to have risen 3.1 percent in February.
   The March level of sales was the lowest since an annual rate of
556,000 units a year earlier. Sales began to pick up in mid-1989 as
mortgage interest rates declined, peaking at 741,000 units in July.
   But rates returned to their double-digit level in January and
ranged between 10.22 percent and 10.34 percent in March, according
to a survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   The National Association of Realtors also blamed high rates for
flat sales of existing homes in March. They were unchanged from
February's seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.4 million units.
   Rates have continued to rise this month, reaching 10.56 percent
Friday, their highest level since averaging 10.61 percent in May,
according to the Freddie Mac survey.
   The outlook for rates ``is not particularly positive,'' said
Robert Villanueva, director of forecasting for the National
Association of Home Builders.
   ``We had hoped that as we got into the summer building season,
that interest rates would begin to drop,'' he said. ``But there's
so many factors suggesting that rates will stay up that that's
probably a forlorn hope.''
   But while rates were rising, the median price of new homes was
falling, down 1.4 percent to $123,200. The median price means that
half of the homes cost more, half less. On the other hand, the
average price of a new home rose 0.7 percent to $150,300.
   Sales in the South led the March decline, down 14.8 percent to
219,000 units. They were off 13.4 percent in the West to 161,000
units.
   But in the Northeast, where housing has been in the doldrums,
sales rose 33.8 percent to 99,000 units. They also were up in the
Midwest, 9.2 percent to 95,000 units.
   Berson said both increases were rebounds from the fourth coldest
December on record. He said it takes an average of seven weeks
between the time buyers start looking at homes to the time they
sign a purchase contract.
   On the other hand, sales in the South and West were not as
adversely affected by the winter weather and more closely followed
the movement in interest rates, he said.
   For the first three months of 1990, sales have fallen 5 percent
to an annual rate of 153,000 homes.

   Actress Farrah Fawcett likes her independence and
has decided that marriage is definitely out of the question.
   Why?
   ``Because marriage is purely a business contract. It kills
romance,'' she said.
   She said men don't like her independence, and longtime love Ryan
O'Neal is the only man so far who has accepted it. She said O'Neal
still proposes marriage, even after 10 years.
   She recalled the time in 1977 when she divorced Lee Majors,
fired her manager and quit the television series ``Charlie's
Angels.''
   Unlike O'Neal, who doesn't hesitate to show his emotions or pick
a verbal fight, Majors was the silent type, she said in an
interview published Monday in The Denver Post.
   ``Lee didn't talk. He thought I should come home and make the
dinner. And he didn't support me leaving the show,'' she said.
   And at ``Charlie's Angels,'' she said, ``the male producers kept
patting me on the head while I was complaining that the characters
had no depth.''
   Fawcett said she has taken control of her career and has since
starred in such acclaimed movies as ``Extremities'' and ``The
Burning Bed.''
   She said O'Neal accepts her the way she is.
   ``I'm my own woman and Ryan likes me that way,'' she said.
``He's never said `Don't do it.'''

   Margaret T. Hance, a pro-business leader who
presided over eight years of explosive growth as Phoenix's first
woman mayor, has died of cancer. She was 66.
   Hance, a national co-chairwoman of President Reagan's 1984
re-election campaign, died Sunday. The type of cancer was not
immediately disclosed.
   Mrs. Hance was elected mayor in November 1975 and served four
two-year terms before retiring in 1983.
   In 1988, she directed George Bush's presidential campaign in
Arizona.
   Reagan appointed Mrs. Hance to the Advisory Commission on
Intergovernmental Relations and the Presidential Federalism
Advisory Committee. She also was a trustee of the U.S. Conference
of Mayors, a director of the National League of Cities and a former
president of the National Conference of Republican Mayors.
   Born Margaret Taylor in Spirit Lake, Iowa, on July 2, 1923, Mrs.
Hance had lived in Arizona since 1926. She was a graduate of
Scripps College in Claremont, Calif.
   Survivors include a daughter, Galen, and two sons, Richard and

   Syrian officials said today that
kidnappers freed U.S. hostage Frank Reed in Beirut after 43 months
of captivity. In Washington, the State Department confirmed the
release.
   ``We've got confirmation that he's been released and is in
Syrian hands in Lebanon,'' said Kim Hoggard, a State Department
spokeswoman.
   Reed was the second American to be freed by pro-Iranian Moslem
kidnappers in nine days. U.S. professor Robert Polhill was freed on
April 22.
   President Bush welcomed Reed's release, but said: ``We cannot
rest ... until all hostages are free.''
   Iran, however, cautioned that unless the United States
reciprocates with a goodwill gesture, no more American hostages
will be walking to freedom.
   ``Now the ball is in the court of the U.S. and the Western
countries,'' said the English-language Tehran Times, considered
close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani. The comments were in a
Tuesday editorial.
   The Syrian officials, who refused to be identified further, said
Reed, 57, was freed in Beirut at 8:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. EDT) and was
en route to the Syrian capital by car. They said they expected him
in Damascus within two hours.
   Reed was being escorted by officers of the Syrian army
contingent that controls east and north Lebanon as well as Moslem
west Beirut, where he was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986.
   The Syrian offcials would not say where in Beirut the hostage
was freed. Journalists crowding the seaside Summerland Hotel, where
previous hostages were released, said they did not see any hostage.
   Earlier today in Washington, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said a hostage reception team was being dispatched to
Wiesbaden, West Germany. U.S. officials were in Wiesbaden just last
week, debriefing Polhill after his 39-month-long ordeal.
   In Malden, Mass., Reed's hometown, an overjoyed Fahima ``Fifi''
Reed got word from the State Department that her husband had been
turned over to Syrian authorities.
   ``They have word that Frank is with the Syrians now,'' she said.
``He's been handed over to the Syrians.''
   Reed's release came a day after kidnappers released two
statements promising to free him. One was signed by The
Organization of Islamic Dawn.
   Shiite Moslem leader Hussein Musawi, who along with Syria and
Iran played a key role in Polhill's release, said today he had
``not heard of this American hostage or the kidnap group'' before
Sunday.
   ``No Islamic organization loyal to Jerusalem and following
Ayatollah Khomeini's line will hand the Americans a new gift after
its support of the Jerusalem resolution,'' he said.
   He referred to a non-binding resolution passed by the U.S. House
of Representatives last Tuesday endorsing a united Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel.
   Musawi called the resolution a demonstration of American ill
will, and on Wednesday urged kidnappers not to free another
American hostage.
   Musawi spoke to The Associated Press by telephone from his
headquarters in the ancient Roman city of Baalbek in the
Syrian-controlled Bakaa Valley of east Lebanon.
   He is the reputed mentor of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine, the Shiite group that kidnapped Polhill and U.S.
educators Alann Steen and Jesse Turner in Beirut Jan. 24, 1987.
Turner and Steen are still captives.
   Iranian state radio, meanwhile, accused Washington of damaging
efforts to free the Western hostages remaining in Lebanon by not
reciprocating for Polhill's release.
   ``With regard to Washington's reaction .... the process of
solving the hostage-taking crisis is much slower than was
previously expected,'' Tehran Radio said in a commentary. The
dispatch was monitored in Cyprus.
   After Polhill's release, Iranian officials and Lebanese Shiite
leaders called for the reciprocal releases of Shiite
fundamentalists held by Israel and Kuwait. President Bush has said
he refuses to deal for the hostages.
   The Tehran Times today quoted an unnamed Iranian official today
as saying Reed's captors agreed to free him after ``extensive
talks'' that followed Polhill's release.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, is seeking
to improve ties with the West after a decade of hostility. He is
opposed at home by fundamentalist radicals allied to the Shiite
militants in Lebanon.
   Reed, 57, was the director of the Lebanese International School.
   The promise to free him was made in two typewritten statements,
accompanied by three photographs of the hostage. The messages and
photos were delivered to Beirut's independent daily An-Nahar and a
Western news agency.
   No demands was made for Reed's release. The kidnappers said he
would carry a message to the Bush administrtaion.
   The first statement was unsigned. The second identified the
kidnap faction as the Organization of Islamic Dawn. His abduction
was earlier claimed by the Organization of Arab Revolutionary
Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade.
   Reed had lived in Beirut since late 1977, before he was
kidnapped. He had converted to Islam to marry his second wife,
Fahima Dalati, a Syrian Moslem.
   He has a son, 9-year-old Tarek with Fahima, who prefers to be
called Fifi, and two other children, Jacqueline and Marilyn, from
his first marriage. They live in Medford, Mass. Mrs. Reed has been
staying with her mother-in-law in Malden since leaving Beirut last
year.
   The 16 hostages remaining in Lebanon include six Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest-held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The AP. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Train and Truck Carrying Molten Aluminum Collide Near Spokane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of a train crew chased more than
100 runaway cars but were unable to prevent derailments, a
spectacular fire and a collision with a truck carrying molten
aluminum, authorities said.
   The four-man crew was relieved of duty pending an investigation
into Sunday night's accident about five miles east of Spokane, said
Howard Kallio, Burlington Northern Railroad spokesman in Seattle.
   The crew was undergoing urinalysis tests for drugs, he said
Monday.
   No serious injuries were reported in the accidents, which caused
an estimated $218,000 damage to railroad equipment and signals,
Kallio said.
   ``We're chalking it up to human error,'' Kallio said. ``It looks
like the crew made an error in not properly fitting the brakes on
that train.''
   Failure to properly set brakes while uncoupling three
locomotives from a 101-car train let the cars roll free on a
2{-mile westbound runaway.
   One of the locomotives chased the runaway cars but struck a
Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Co. truck at a crossing and derailed,
Kallio said.
   He said the truck was carrying two 15,000-pound crucibles of
molten aluminum.
   The containers, carrying its load from Kaiser's Mead smelter to
its Trentwood rolling mill, remained intact, spokeswoman Susan Ashe
said. To save energy costs, the company has been hauling molten
metal from its smelter to its rolling plant since 1971 without a
major incident, Ms. Ashe said.
   The runaway cars continued westbound, striking an eastbound
Montana Rail Link train, derailing its locomotive and 16 cars of
the runaway train. The derailments ignited a 1,000-gallon propane
tank, said West Valley Fire Chief Rod Tedrow.
   The tank's blast was loud enough to trigger burglar alarms in
nearby homes.
   ``I heard these two loud explosions that rattled my windows,''
said Tara Havers. ``Then I looked out my kitchen window and I saw
this big fireball.''
   The tank held fuel for switch heaters, which are used to keep
track switches from freezing during winter, Kallio and Tedrow said.
   The blaze was extinguished before midnight, Tedrow said.
   Tedrow said the Spokane rail yard was not notified that the cars
were running loose so that safety signals and switches could be
thrown.
   Kallio said he did not know how fast any of the cars or the
locomotive were traveling at the time of the collisions.
   ``There were cars popping off the track here and there all
along'' the route after the two trains collided, Tedrow said.
   The railroad's main line east of the city was closed while
repair crews removed wreckage, Kallio said.
   Several trains, including Amtrak passenger trains, were rerouted
to Union Pacific tracks between Spokane and Sandpoint, Idaho, about
75 miles to the northeast, without significant delay, Kallio said.

   The Reagan administration's Department of
Housing and Urban Development was a ``domestic political machine''
under Samuel R. Pierce Jr., handing out grants to the well
connected, a former HUD official later convicted of bribery told a
House subcommittee Monday.
   Dubois L. Gilliam, a former deputy assistant secretary under
Pierce, disputed the former housing secretary's assertion that he
didn't decide who got federal grants. Pierce himself ordered
federal grants in some cases, Gilliam said.
   He linked the Reagan White House to the HUD controversy in at
least one specific instance, saying the administration ordered
federal money for a New Mexico project that had encountered
problems.
   ``We dealt strictly with politics,'' he told the panel that has
spent more than a year investigating allegations of fraud,
mismanagement, influence peddling and political favoritism at HUD.
   ``During the period I was there ... the Department of Housing
and Urban Development was the best domestic political machine I
have ever seen,'' Gilliam said.
   Gilliam's testimony was the first the panel has heard from a
former top HUD insider about Pierce's eight years as secretary.
   Pierce's lawyers, who attended the hearing, dismissed Gilliam's
testimony as lacking credibility.
   Attorney Paul Perito called the testimony ``a sordid menu from
an admitted felon.'' He said Gilliam never accused Pierce of
violating the law, and that Gilliam was testifying in an effort to
win early release from prison.
   Pierce testified before the panel last May, later invoking his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid further
testimony. Three former top aides also refused to testify.
   Gilliam is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading
guilty to accepting gratuities and conspiracy to defraud the
government for abuse of HUD programs.
   Testifying under a court-ordered grant of immunity, he described
receiving as much as $100,000 in clothes, money, travel and other
gratuities from developers and consultants.
   Gilliam said he did not believe Pierce ever took any illegal
gratuities.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., called Gilliam ``the
key missing piece in the jigsaw puzzle.''
   Gilliam's testimony about the Urban Development Action Grant
program raised new allegations about a program under which grants
were to be based on numerical formulas. He said HUD under Pierce
considered who outside the agency supported projects when deciding
which ones got money.
   Lantos asked Gilliam if he would agree with statements Pierce
made in a September magazine interview and to his committee in May
1989, saying he never told his top assistants to fund particular
projects by developers seeking HUD grants.
   ``I know for a fact the secretary made decisions'' on HUD
grants, Gilliam said.
   He said Deborah Gore Dean, once Pierce's executive assistant,
would not allow approval of discretionary grants ``without first
clearing it with him.'' Dean also has refused to testify before the
Hose Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing.
   Gilliam said Pierce took a direct role in a proposed UDAG
project at Hampton Institute, a predominantly black college in
Virginia.
   ``He told me he wanted me to assist them and he wanted it
funded,'' Gilliam said, referring to Pierce.
   Gilliam said that order came despite the lack of an application
or financing for the project. Pierce later removed himself from the
Hampton decision at the suggestion of the HUD general counsel
because of his ties to the school, Gilliam said.
   ``The project was way down the road (toward approval) at that
time,'' Gilliam said.
   Gilliam also testified that Dean told him Carol Crawford,
associate director of the White House's budget office, ordered a
UDAG grant go to an Albuquerque project in 1987. He said Dean
learned that Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., had appealed to Howard
Baker, then the White House chief of staff, for help on the project.
   In another case, Gilliam said Pierce took a direct role in
ordering the transfer to another job of a career HUD employee,
David Sowell. He said Sowell had raised questions about the
financial commitment offered on a proposed UDAG project by Lance
Wilson, a former top aide to Pierce who was then working for a Wall
Street investment firm.
   Gilliam said he suggested the transfer, and Pierce ordered it,
after he expressed concern that Sowell was calling the department
inspector general's fraud hot-line number. He said Wilson, after
leaving HUD, was providing letters of financial commitment to get
projects past application hurdles when the intent was that the
project would obtain other financing later.
   Gilliam agreed with Lantos' description of Wilson's financial
commitment as ``fraudulent.''
   Pierce also acted to block grants for those in his disfavor,
Gilliam said, citing a long-running feud between Pierce and Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.
   Gilliam said that when Pierce learned that Gonzalez wanted a San
Antonio project, the HUD secretary rejected it.
   Gilliam's testimony was to continue Wednesday and Friday.

<HEAD>Text of Tehran Times Commentary on U.S. Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a commentary to be
published Tuesday in the English-language Tehran Times on the
hostage issue. The editorial was made available to The Associated
Press in advance:
   By releasing a second American hostage, Lebanese Moslem groups
proved their good will to the United States and the Western
countries.
   Release of the two American hostages without any pre-conditions
and solely for humanitarian and Islamic causes was an extreme
gesture of good will and self-sacrifice by Lebanese Moslem groups.
   This important and major step showed that Lebanese Moslem groups
are fully prepared for the resolution of the hostage crisis in the
shortest possible time. They proved this readiness in practice.
   From the viewpoint of the Islamic republic of Iran, which put in
months of hard effort, something miraculous has happened.
   The U.S. reaction after the release of the first U.S. hostage
was not likeable, and it was also very unexpected. The U.S. House
of Representatives in an ugly move declared Jerusalem as Israel's
capital.
   President Bush declared he will show no good will until the
release of all the hostages. Pro-Israeli and pro-Western groups
released only four Lebanese Moslems from the hundreds of hostages
they hold.
   Such moves were distantly hostile and also insufficient for
creation of a serious humanitarian move. Moreover, the barbaric
attacks of the occupier regime of Israel increased in the past week
after the release of the first hostage.
   These actions in response to the Lebanese Moslem groups'
humanitarian move showed that the U.S and other Western countries
are not seriously determined to solve the hostage issue.
   With respect to these actions, the Lebanese Moslem groups were
seriously doubtful about releasing a second hostage, thus
endangering the entire effort of the Islamic republic.
   In order to pave the way for the release of all the hostages and
to give the U.S. and the West a second opportunity so that they can
give an appropriate response and show mutual good will, the Islamic
republic insisted the Lebanese groups release a second hostage.
   Fortunately, with the unconditional release of a second hostage
the extreme good will of the Lebanese Moslem groups and the Islamic
republic of Iran was proved to the world.
   Now the ball is in the court of the U.S. and the Western
countries.
   Through a mutual show of good will they can pressure Israel and
pro-Western groups to release Lebanese prisoners and hostages, thus
giving fresh life to the moves started by the Islamic republic,
causing the release of the hostages to continue.
   The Islamic republic used its maximum power and credibility for
the release of the hostages.
   Naturally, without an appropriate response from the West, there
is no chance for the continuation of Iranian mediation and requests.
   Release of only four Lebanese from among hundreds of hostages
and prisoners is nothing. It would be appropriate if, as the next
step, a significant number of hostages including a few Iranian
hostages and Sheik Obeid be released so that we can celebrate the
year 1990 as the end of the hostage crisis.

<HEAD>May Day Holiday Looking Grim For Brazilian Unionists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An economic austerity program
decreed six weeks ago has brought massive layoffs, and Tuesday's
May Day holiday is no cause for celebration among Brazilian
unionists.
   ``The economic situation has us with our backs against the
wall,'' said Gilmar Carneiro, a union leader in Sao Paulo, the
nation's largest city.
   The austerity plan was announced by President Fernando Collor de
Mello on March 16, one day after he took office. It included
spending cuts, the sale of state companies, and firing of
government workers. It also froze $115 billion in savings accounts
and money market deposits for 18 months.
   The measures, which Collor said were necessary to combat annual
inflation of nearly 5,000 percent, have drastically cut the cost of
living. But the economy appears headed for a steep recession.
   An estimated 300,000 workers have already been fired nationwide
and about 700,000 more were put on collective holiday. On Friday,
1,470 metalworkers were laid off by three Sao Paulo firms.
   After giving workers a pay increase in March of 73 percent _ 10
percent less than the month's inflation _ the government froze
wages in April. Labor and independent groups estimate inflation was
at least 24 percent in April.
   The Inter-Union Department of Statistics and Socio-Economic
Studies, a respected labor research group, said this month's
minimum wage will be worth only $50, its lowest level since being
created in 1940.
   Many Brazilians support Collor's efforts against inflation, but
unions say workers are paying too high a price.
   Despite their opposition, no major strikes have been declared
since March 16, and labor leaders say workers are so fearful of
losing their jobs that unions are unable to act.
   ``Before, if paychecks were even a day late, there were strikers
at factory gates,'' Carlos Aparicio Clemente, secretary-general of
the Metalworkers Union in Osasco, Sao Paulo, told the major
newsweekly Isto E. ``Important conquests by workers are being lost
overnight.''
   ``(Strikes) now would be stupidity. Our priority is the
maintenance of jobs,'' said Jair Meneguelli, president of the
leftist Workers Central Union, the country's largest labor
federation representing 12 million workers.
   Unions, which represent about a third of Brazil's 65
million-strong workforce, are even having a hard time preventing
workers from accepting salary cuts, as some businesses have
demanded.
   ``We are against making concessions to the bosses,'' said
Carneiro. ``When companies are making profits they never want to
share the gains.''
   But about 30 salary reduction pacts have already been signed in
the past month, compared with a total of only five such deals
during the country's last recession between 1981 and 1983.
   Many union leaders say companies are using the economic turmoil
as a smokescreen.
   ``The mentality (of businessmen) is to take advantage of
short-term difficulties,'' said Luis Antonio Medeiros, president of
the Sao Paulo Metalworkers Union.
   But business leaders say wage cuts are the only way to prevent
wider layoffs, as sales and revenues have plunged.
   ``Our sector is not going to return to the same level of
production of before March 16,'' said Domicio dos Santos Junior, of
the National Sindicate of Automobile Manufacturers. ``Reducing the
work week and salaries is an attempt to minimize the effects of
unemployment.''
   Last Friday, the Sindicate proposed 130,000 industry
metalworkers accept a temporary 30 percent cut in hours _ and thus
salary. The average industry wage is currently $500 monthly.
   Meanwhile, union leaders fear darker days are ahead. A survey of
755 firms conducted by the Federation of Industries of Sao Paulo
State, revealed 14.3 percent intend to fire workers over the next
months.
   Carneiro estimated up to 250,000 bank workers, about 30 percent
of the industry total, may be laid off if the economy doesn't pick
up speed soon.
   ``If the situation worsens there may be strikes, but right now
we don't have the forces,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Jurors in Imelda Marcos' fraud trial were told
Monday about $1 million in newly-minted Philippine pesos and
jewelry that were seized after the Marcoses fled to Hawaii.
   Twenty-two boxes of currency and jewelry, including a diamond
tiara, were on a U.S. Air Force plane that followed the Marcoses to
this country on Feb. 26, 1986, the day after Ferdinand Marcos was
ousted as president, U.S. Customs agent Leslie E. Kinney said.
   Kinney returned to the stand after his testimony was interrupted
Thursday, when Mrs. Marcos, 60, became ill from high blood pressure.
   On Monday, Mrs. Marcos was hooked up to a portable blood
pressure monitor that beeped intermittently during Kinney's
testimony.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of helping her husband steal more than
$220 million from the Philippine treasury to buy Manhattan real
estate and art.
   She has pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
Marcos, who also had been charged, died last September in Hawaii.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi, is charged
with mail fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping
the Marcoses conceal their ownership of four Manhattan buildings.
   Kinney identified four suitcases and a cardboard box, which he
said were among the 300 to 400 pieces of luggage that came with the
Marcos entourage to Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu.
   He said the box was one of 22 that contained a total of 27
million pesos. He described the majority of the currency, whose
value in 1986 was $1.4 million, as being ``in mint condition and
consecutively numbered.''
   Kinney also testified that jewelry was found in two suitcases,
one containing an embossed card with Mrs. Marcos' name on it and
the other had an invitation addressed to Mrs. Marcos tucked inside.
   Although jurors did not see the contents, Kinney identified
seven pieces of jewelry, including two tiaras, necklaces and
brooches, from photographs entered into evidence.
   The other suitcases were a battered aluminum case that Kinney
said was filled with financial documents and a designer case
marked: ``Properties -New York.'' He said the latter held Marcos'
business documents and certificates of bearer stock.
   Kinney said the pesos, jewelry, documents and stock certificates
were first stored in an underground ammunition bunker at Hickam,
and later moved to a Customs vault in Honolulu. Most of the other
luggage was returned.
   During cross-examination, Mrs. Marcos' lawyer, Gerry Spence,
presented Customs declaration forms that had been filed on behalf
of the Marcoses in February and March 1986.
   The forms reported more than 15 million pesos, the stock
certificates, $315,000 in U.S. currency and 24 gold bars, which
were worth about $286,000 in 1986.
   Spence also read from an attachment to the forms that said
neither Marcos nor his agents were aware of the specific contents
of the cargo and that receipt of the luggage ``is not an admission
of ownership.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government AIDS researcher hid his financial
interest in a business while steering nearly $1 million worth of
National Institutes of Health contracts to the company,
congressional investigators said Monday.
   As a result of the congressional probe and a resulting
investigation by a federal grand jury, researcher Syed Zaki
Salahuddin was suspended Monday without pay, NIH officials said.
   ``The National Cancer Institute and NIH take violations of
standards of conduct and concealment of financial interests in
companies with which the government does business extremely
seriously,'' William Raub, acting director of NIH, said in
announcing the suspension.
   Salahuddin was out of the country Monday, according to his
brother, S.M. Salahuddin.
   Raub disclosed the suspension at a hearing before the House
Commerce investigations subcommittee, whose chairman, Rep. John D.
Dingell, D-Mich., called the affair ``a sorry tale of gross
conflict of interest.''
   ``We appear to have an atmosphere of waste and abuse'' at NIH,
Dingell said. ``It is no great surprise that one or more NIH
scientists may have taken advantage of the lax atmosphere for
personal gain.''
   Raub said he was unaware of any potential ``sweetheart deal,''
such as the one charged to Salahuddin, that has been rooted out by
NIH procedures over the past five years.
   ``Either we have a situation where human beings involved in NIH
contracts are not falling victim'' to temptation or NIH procedures
for detecting such conduct are not very good, said Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore.
   ``I have the same concerns you have,'' Raub replied.
   Investigators from the General Accounting Office, an arm of
Congress, have spent 16 months probing the case of Salahuddin and
Pan-Data Systems, a small computer and biomedical company in
Rockville, Md. Among the findings:
   _The company's growth has been due in good part to a large
number of NIH contracts for goods and services, most of which were
bought by the laboratory headed by Robert G. Gallo, where
Salahuddin worked until Monday.
   _Salahuddin was one of two people authorized access to
Pan-Data's new post office box in 1984, shortly after the company
was incorporated. His wife, Firoza, was listed as 25 percent owner
in the papers of incorporation. Corporate minutes submitted to the
Small Business Administration a few months later indicated
Salahuddin was an equal shareholder and director.
   _In 1985 and 1986, NIH was assured by the president of Pan-Data
that ``neither Mr. or Mrs. Salahuddin has any connection to this
company. Neither have ever received, nor are they entitled to, any
gratification in any form, monetary or otherwise.''
   Said Raub: ``It certainly appears that the letters ... were
false.''
   _Salahuddin filed required annual financial-disclosure
statements with NIH and never indicated any ownership of Pan-Data.
In 1986, Gallo confronted Salahuddin with rumors of a financial
interest in the company; Salahuddin said only his wife had been an
employee and that she would quit.
   _Documents submitted to SBA identified Salahuddin as a Pan-Data
owner and director of corporate development.
   _In 1988, Salahuddin and another scientist in Gallo's lab were
assigned to evaluate two proposed contracts for testing a herpes
virus.
   ``Prior to participating in the technical evaluation, Salahuddin
told the assistant project director that Pan-Data Systems was the
`only competent lab' to perform the required assays,'' said GAO
investigator Clark B. Hall. NIH awarded contracts to Pan-Data and a
competitor.
   Salahuddin told NIH officials Wednesday that his wife had been a
founder of Pan-Data. In 1987 or 1988, Raub quoted Salahuddin as
saying, the company had paid for the painting of the couple's home
and had made mortgage payments on the house to compensate for Mrs.
Salahuddin's services as a founder.
   Raub said NIH has tightened contract-review procedures in the
wake of the Salahuddin investigation.

<HEAD>Woman's Fight Means Poor Families Get More Housing Choices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman's fight for better housing with
government assistance means that families across the country will
have a wider choice of places to live, her lawyer says.
   Ann Smith, a nursing student with three children, sued federal
and local housing authorities after she could not find an
affordable apartment in Narragansett and the town's housing
officials would not allow her to use a rent-subsidy certificate
elsewhere.
   Narragansett officials cited federal regulations that the
certificates could be used only in the town in which they were
issued.
   But Ms. Smith complained that the $691-a-month limit on rent and
utilities for a three-bedroom apartment ``wasn't even close'' to
rents in the city. However, she did find a suitable apartment in
North Kingstown.
   As a result of her suit, officials at the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development now acknowledge they misinterpreted a
1987 change in federal law and that the certificates can be used
outside the community in which they are issued.
   ``The opportunity for finding decent housing is going to be
expanded greatly,'' said Robert M. Sabel, a Rhode Island Legal
Services lawyer who represented Ms. Smith.
   In Rhode Island, 4,417 families use the certificates for
housing. Families must earn less than half the average local annual
income and must contribute 30 percent of their income for rent.
   Ms. Smith's only income was $626 a month in Aid to Families with
Dependent Children. She said she did not have time to work between
her nursing studies and caring for her children, the oldest of whom
is 10.
   HUD officials admitted they were wrong in January, and later
U.S. District Judge Ronald R. Lagueux approved a settlement, The
Providence Journal reported Monday.
   The 1987 law said a certificate issued in a metropolitan area
can be used anywhere within it, so poor people aren't forced to
congregate in one area. But HUD officials originally interpreted
that to mean the certificate must be used in the city where it was
issued.
   The agency now has ruled that a certificate is good for an area
that includes a city and all the surrounding communities with
strong economic and social ties to it. For Providence, that
includes all of Rhode Island, as well as eight communities in
Massachusetts.
   HUD spokesman Bill Glavin said the federal agency soon would
tell all housing authorities of the change.

   A Latvian citizen's group claiming to represent
hundreds of thousands of Latvians demanded Monday that the republic
follow Lithuania's lead and declare independence from the Soviet
Union, a spokeswoman said.
   In Lithuania, about 20,000 people gathered to honor a countryman
who burned himself to death in Moscow to protest the Kremlin's
efforts to end Lithuania's independence drive.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis called the man ``the
first victim'' in the struggle for independence. ``And we hope he
is the last,'' he told the crowd, according to Giedrius Drukteimis
of the Sajudis pro-independence movement.
   The Latvian spokeswoman, voicing sentiments identical to those
heard in Lithuania, said, ``This is an occupied country. We are
under Soviet power here, under an occupying army.''
   The Latvian Citizens' Congress, elected mainly from among ethnic
Latvians, convened Monday and called for restoration of Latvian
independence, spokeswoman Iveeta Buicke said.
   Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were independent countries between
World War I and World War II but were forcibly annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940.
   Ethnic Latvians make up just over half of Latvia's population of
2.7 million, and a poll published Monday by the Soviet government
newspaper Izvestia said that 92 percent of those polled favor
secession. Non-Latvian residents make up 46 percent of the
republic, and 45 percent were for independence.
   The congress met three days before the official Latvian Supreme
Soviet parliament was to consider whether to emulate Lithuania's
March 11 declaration of independence.
   The Estonian parliament also has made clear it intends to follow
Lithuania in seceding from the Soviet Union, but more cautiously.
   The Latvian congress claims the right to replace the republic's
Supreme Soviet during the transition to independence. Its members
were elected in March by registered ethnic Latvian voters. It says
it represents about 700,000 Latvians.
   Latvian politicians are predicting a heated parliamentary battle
on the independence issue later this week.
   ``May 3 and 4 are going to be very hot days,'' said Anda Anspoka
of the pro-independence Latvian People's Front, which won a
majority in the Supreme Soviet in elections held in March.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev recently warned Latvian
delegates that he would offer the republic special status in a
reconfigured Soviet federation but he would not accept outright
secession.
   Gorbachev embargoed oil and natural gas shipments to Lithuania
in response to its parliament's declaration of independence,
although the sanctions do not seem to have dampened the Lithuanians
drive for sovereignty.
   Official Vilnius Radio reported on Sunday that Moscow planned to
ease the sanctions by increasing natural gas deliveries to a large
fertilizer plant at Jonova.
   However, deliveries did not increase Monday, and it was
impossible to learn whether they would start before the end of the
May Day holiday on Wednesday.
   The Lithuanians continued their protests. The body of the
suicide victim, Stanislovas Jamaitis, 52, was flown to Vilnius from
Moscow on Monday and taken to the Supreme Council parliament
building in central Vilnius, Drukteimis said.
   Lithuanian radio and television broadcast announcements of the
memorial service for Jamaitis, and Soviet TV showed brief footage
Monday night of the crowds gathered near the parliament building.
   Jamaitis is to be buried Wednesday in his home village of
Ezherelis near Kaunas, the republic's second city.
   Landsbergis, in a television appearance Monday, discouraged
other Lithuanians from similar actions. In his speech at the
gathering, he emphasized that ``we don't need victims,'' Drukteimis
said.
   The suicide recalled the self-immolation of Lithuanian student
Roman Kalanta in Kaunas in 1972. Kalanta became a martyr of
Lithuanian nationalism, and the independence movement appeared to
be preparing a similar role for Jamaitis.
   In the text of Jamaitis' suicide note released in Lithuania on
Friday, he said ``Lithuanians will not live in a Lithuania that is
not independent.''
   Jamaitis died Thursday of burns he received when he doused
himself with gasoline and set fire to himself in front of Moscow's
Bolshoi Theater.
   Gorbachev has said that republics have the right to secede from
the Soviet Union, but only if they do so in accordance with Soviet
law.
   A law on secession requires two-thirds of a republic's voters to
approve independence in a referendum and calls for a subsequent
waiting period of five years in which the republic and Soviet Union
would negotiate the terms of secession.

   Walk into Maryellen Visconti's Center
for Peak Performance and she shoots words like ``neurosensory
development'' your way faster than a buzzing beta wave.
   She runs a health club for the mind in a mall in this university
town, believing that ``mind-brain fitness is to the '90s what body
fitness was to the '80s.''
   Instead of slogans like ``no pain, no gain,'' Visconti urges her
clients to ``find the zone'' and ``get in the flow.'' Instead of
weight machines, Visconti 2000, as the center is known, offers a
sound and light show using specially-designed goggles.
   The goggles have little flashing red lights inside, around the
eyeholes. Anybody who kept their eyes open while wearing the
goggles would shoot right out of the zone and into hyperactivity.
But with the eyes closed, the lights flash subtle, changing
patterns on the lids.
   The light shows are supposed to help clients reach a sort of
meditative state so they can enhance creativity and accelerate
learning, or, in Visconti-speak, to access ``personal skills and
resources for creating the state of excellence to be in the flow.''
   A session with the goggles, which usually lasts about 20
minutes, costs $25.
   Visconti stresses that she uses tapes, books and workshops to
educate clients. But the nerve center of her mind gym is a room
with two comfortable black chairs, where customers settle in for
sessions with goggles programmed to take them to ``the zone.''
There are also headphones designed to produce the same effect via a
low hum in the ears.
   And what is ``the zone?'' Something like a hypnotic or
meditative state, achieved when brain waves go from the beta to the
alpha level.
   Visconti describes the beta state as ``chatter, chatter, chatter
because of outside stimulation.'' The alpha state is a relaxed
level where creativity and the ability to learn are at their peak,
she said.
   For Gary Antonick, winding up his studies at Harvard
University's business school, Visconti 2000 sounded like a great
idea.
   Antonick, a fit and trim 27-year-old, said his experience as a
swimmer first sparked his interest in mental gymnastics.
   In college, at the University of Michigan, Antonick said he
improved his performance on the school swim team through a
technique called visualization.
   ``I went from terrible to all-American due to just a few minutes
a day imagining what I was going to do in the water,'' said
Antonick.
   Antonick said he has several goals for his mental workouts. One
is to improve his game, literally. ``I'm a terrible squash player
and I worked on it for two months and I was still terrible,'' he
said.
   The other is to improve his mental skills _ maybe pick up a
language. And the third is to keep himself healthy. ``Is it
possible to cure a cold by visualization?'' he wondered.
   Visconti cautions that her company is not a health center; more
an educational clinic. She has no formal training in psychology,
but lists in her resume certifications in accelerated learning,
stress management and self-talk technology. She originally was
trained as a nutritionist and worked as a communications consultant
for 20 years.
   Visconti's image is hardly that of the new-age crystal wearing,
crunchy granola type. In fact, she looks every inch the
businesswoman, bustling about a high-tech office decorated in stark
black and white.
   ``What got me really going on this was as a young child, people
told me I was very creative,'' Visconti said. ``Throughout my life
I was very attracted to what the creative process was all about.''
   She opened the Visconti 2000 center last fall. Although she
won't say how many people now come to her on a regular basis, she
says the center has sparked inquiries from as far away as Japan.
   There are scientists who say so far, research shows the best way
to improve learning ability is the old-fashioned way: with hard
work.
   ``There isn't any shortcut to that,'' said James McGaugh,
director of the Center for Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at
the University of California, Irvine. ``Everything is pretty
straightforward. Pay attention. Stay alert. Study hard.''

<HEAD>Hostage Had Remained in Lebanon Despite Danger</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Hostages, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Herbert Reed, freed Monday after being held hostage in
Lebanon for more than 3{ years, had remained in the war-battered
country because he felt he was ``doing good'' as an educator, his
brother said.
   Even so, he had become convinced it was too dangerous to stay,
and at the time of his abduction was trying to obtain a permanant
resident visa for his Syrian-born wife, Fahima ``Fifi'' Dalati.
   A native of Boston's northern suburb of Malden, Reed attended
Harvard University, the University of Maine and Northeastern
University.
   At the time of his abduction, Reed was running the private
Lebanese International School, which he founded after his former
school, the International College, had been bombed out.
   According to Reed's older brother Edward, ``he thought it was a
challenge to be there. He thought he was doing good there.''
   But because of the increasing danger to Americans in Lebanon,
Edward Reed said, he ``had intentions of coming home.''
   Red had converted to Islam to marry his second wife, and the
couple has a 9-year-old son, Tarek. Reed also has two grown
daughters from a previous marriage.
   Reed's wife was to fly to West Germany, where her husband was to
be flown from Damascus. She said he looked thinner and older in a
photograph furnished by his captors, and she added, ``He'll need
lots of love and affection.''
   Reed's 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, said she had never
lost faith that her son would be freed. ``I haven't been able to
cry for four years,'' Mrs. Sprague said. ``Now I can smile and say
thank God.''
   One of Reed's daughters by his first marriage, Marilyn Langston,
expressed concern about her father's health, noting reports that
said Reed tried to escape and was beaten severely.
   ``It really depends on how they were treated,'' she said. ``If
you think about being held almost four years without any contacts
from the outside world, there's got to be something you'll have to
go through.''
   Before moving to Lebanon, Reed had been a teacher and school
principal in New England, and he earned a reputation as an
adventurer.
   He founded the Admiral Byrd Polar Club in Whitefield, N.H.,
which sponsored polar expeditions. Reed had traveled to the North
Pole, the jungles of Brazil and the Australian outback.
   Reed was a personable, outgoing man, who made two trips to
Lebanon before leaving his post as school principal in Whitefield,
N.H., to become director of elementary education at Beirut's
International College in 1977.
   After Reed was abducted on Sept. 9, 1986, a caller to a Western
news agency claimed the American was a CIA spy.
   Reed's family called the espionage charge ridiculous.

   Storms will delay
Discovery's return to Florida, but the orbiter was in excellent
shape after its 2.1-million-mile journey to launch the Hubble Space
Telescope, NASA said Monday.
   ``You could almost roll this thing out there and fly it again,''
shuttle processing manager Tip Talone said.
   Few problems were found during preliminary inspection, Talone
said. The shuttle's heat-shield tiles sustained 33 ``dings,'' but
only five tiles were damaged seriously enough to require
replacement, he said.
   Discovery, equipped with new and improved brakes, landed on a
concrete runway at this desert military base on Sunday after a
five-day mission to deploy the $1.5 billion telescope to study
mysteries of the universe.
   NASA engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland
said Monday they got the orbiting telescope working again by
freeing a movable antenna that had jammed after brushing against an
electrical cable.
   Gusts up to 40 mph threatened to delay Discovery's landing, but
subsided long enough. Later, high winds kicked up a huge dust storm
as crews towed Discovery across the dry lakebed on which the runway
is located.
   ``It blew like hell,'' Talone said. Winds delayed efforts Monday
to lift Discovery into its 100-foot-tall steel trusswork
maintenance structure.
   Heavy rain fell Monday, slowing shuttle maintenance work as
crews had to cover thrusters and other sensitive components to
prevent water from leaking inside, he added.
   ``It makes life more miserable for guys doing the work,'' Talone
said of the rain.
   Discovery had been scheduled to leave Edwards on Friday, mounted
piggyback atop a modified jumbo jet for a one-day trip to Kennedy
Space Center in Florida.
   Talone said the weather will delay the trip until Saturday, and
possibly make it a two-day journey with an overnight stop at Kelly
Air Force Base, Texas.
   Contributing to the delay was the need to remove one of
Discovery's many small maneuvering thrusters. It failed and leaked
just as the shuttle was being inserted into orbit after its April
24 launch from Florida, he said.
   Just as has been the case after many previous shuttle flights,
Talone insisted Discovery returned to Earth in better shape than
any shuttle has previously.
   ``Each tie we fly these things, it appears even better,'' he
said. ``We're getting a clean vehicle back.''
   Talone said Discovery's new carbon brakes, similar to those used
on passenger jets, ``performed as well or even better than
expected.'' They were removed and shipped to their manufacturer _
B.F. Goodrich in Troy, Ohio _ for analysis.
   But because Columbia and Atlantis haven't yet been fitted with
the improved brakes, it will be late this year or early 1991 before
the carbon brakes are tested again, Talone said.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration hopes the new
brakes and other modifications will allow routine landings to
resume at Kennedy Space Center.
   Talone said other minor problems included some chafing on
Discovery's tires, a protective black coating that flaked off the
surface of one of the damaged tiles, and unexplained but typical
haze and streaks on the shuttle's windshield.
   During Discovery's flight, the crew found a watch that was lost
by astronaut Sonny Carter when the shuttle flew on a classified
Defense Department mission last November.
   At Kennedy Space Center, meanwhile, engineers found a small leak
in the system that feeds liquid oxygen into the Columbia's main
engines, but said repairs shouldn't delay the shuttle's scheduled
May 16 launch to carry the Astro observatory on a nine-day mission.
   Discovery's next flight is scheduled to start Oct. 5, when it
will launch the NASA-European Space Agency's Ulysses spacecraft on
a mission to orbit the sun's poles.

<HEAD>Trade Preference Dropped for Liberia; Kept for Thailand, Indonesia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States will suspend trade benefits
for Liberia on July 1, but will allow Thailand and Indonesia to
continue to participate despite charges they have violated workers'
rights, a trade official said Monday.
   The Bush administration found that Liberia had not taken steps
to better its record but that the two Asian countries had,
according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 130 areas in the Third World were allowed last year to
ship $10 billion worth of goods to the United States duty-free, or
at reduced rates of duty. The measures encourage imports from those
areas because the lower duties make them cheaper and more
attractive to importers than goods from competing countries.
   Auto equipment such as tires, brakes and storage batteries are
among the major imported items. The program is being expanded and
is expected to grow by at least $500 million this year.
   Other major importing countries have similar preference programs.
   U.S. labor organizations had complained that some governments
violated internationally recognized workers' rights by using child
labor, restricting the formation of labor unions and other
measures. U.S. law requires suspending privileges for those
countries.
   A statement issued by Trade Representative Carla Hills said
another year will be taken to review the cases against Syria,
Benin, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Nepal.
   Romania, Nicaragua and Burma remain suspended. Panama was
reinstated earlier this year and Poland and Hungary were added to
the list after the end of hard-line communist rule there.
   Other eastern European countries are expected to follow and
Nicaragua is likely to be reinstated, the official said.
   New products will be made eligible from Bolivia, Colombia,
Ecuador and Peru as part of the Bush administration's decision to
help wean them away from traffic in drugs.

<HEAD>Man Tries To Set Fire to Lenin Mausoleum</HEAD>

   A man with two jars of flammable liquid tried to
set fire over the weekend to the stone mausoleum on Red Square
where the body of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin has been on
display for nearly 70 years, Izvestia reported.
   The government newspaper said the man was arrested, but refused
to answer questions or make any statement except for one sentence:
``My action has said all I have to say.''
   The arson attempt late Saturday came two days before May Day
celebrations that traditionally include columns of marchers passing
through Red Square and being greeted by leaders standing atop the
mausoleum.
   The man, who looked about 45, got past the fence around the
red-brown granite mausoleum and throw two jars of flammable liquid
onto its parapet, Izvestia said Sunday night.
   ``The mausoleum is undamaged, the fire was quickly put out,'' it
reported.
   Statues and monuments to Lenin have come under increasing attack
in Eastern Europe and parts of the Soviet Union. However, no such
gesture was reported previously against the mausoleum, which is
visited by tens of thousands of respectful Soviets each year.
   It was erected not long after Lenin died in 1924.

   Newly released hostage Frank Herbert Reed
was an intelligent adventurer who got caught up in Middle East
turbulence just as he was trying to leave the war-torn region,
friends and relatives say.
   But they also say he had the Yankee stoicism it takes to ride
out even the storm of 3{ years of captivity in Lebanon.
   ``He would never give up. I hope it's a Reed trait. We certainly
are self-made in what we do,'' his 70-year-old brother, Edward,
said after he and other family members received news of the release.
   Reed, 57, had traveled to the North Pole, the jungles of Brazil
and the Australian outback. He was a teacher and school principal
in New England and founded the Admiral Byrd Polar Club in
Whitefield, N.H., which sponsored expeditions to Antarctica.
   But after making two trips to Lebanon, he left his post as
school principal in New Hampshire to become director of elementary
education at Beirut's International College in 1977.
   ``It appealed to the adventurer in him,'' Maryellen Cavan, a
former New Hampshire colleague, said of Reed's decision to move.
   Later, he converted to Islam, the religion of his wife, Fahima
Dalati, 39, a Syrian national who met him in 1977 while she was in
training as a teacher.
   When the International College was bombed out, Reed founded the
private Lebanese International School.
   A nephew said Reed decided to stay on because he believed he
could be of help, especially to young students. And one of his
daughters, Marilyn Langston, has said that education was all
important to him.
   Still, while Reed came to believe ``violence was a way of life''
around Beirut and that he could work around it, he was not inured
to it, Cavan said.
   ``He was pretty flamboyant and wouldn't show he was afraid,''
she said. ``But it certainly unnerved him.''
   Finally, even Reed decided to leave. At the time of his
abduction, he was trying to make arrangements for his wife, known
as Fifi, to come to the United States and ``had intentions of
coming home,'' Edward Reed said.
   The couple has a 9-year-old son, Tarek, and Reed has two grown
daughters from a previous marriage.
   Reed grew up in Malden, the youngest son of three sons. His
father was part owner of a leather wholesale firm.
   ``He was the baby in the family, and whatever the baby wanted,
he got,'' said Edward Reed.
   Reed, who attended Harvard University, the University of Maine
and Northeastern University, was always outgoing and an adventurer,
friends and relatives say.
   ``He had an impact on everybody who dealt with him in our
community,'' Cavan said. ``He's a unique individual.''
   His 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, said she believes her son
can do anything, and even thought during his captivity he might
``outsmart the people who kidnapped him, and escape.''
   Amogene Rolerson, who taught with Reed in the early 1960s in
Islesboro, Maine, said: ``He was a person who liked a lot of
action. He liked to be doing and going. He was always in the thick
of everything.''
   ``I can't imagine him being cooped up all the time that he's
been cooped up,'' she said.
   Reed and his wife faced the objections of her parents because he
was American and Protestant.
   ``We had to try to convince them we wanted to get married,''
Mrs. Reed said. ``We were just the right people for each other.
This is the time I remember. We just had a great time together. I
used to say, `It's too nice to be true,' and it was too nice to be
true. It ended all of a sudden.''
   She and her son have been living at her mother-in-law's Malden
apartment for about a year. They had come on vacation and decided
to stay when violence in Beirut escalated. Almost all of Reed's
immediately surviving relatives were at the apartment when news of
his release came.
   ``I'm thrilled. I'm overjoyed. I'm everything. All of the above
that describe happiness,'' she said.
   After Reed was abducted on Sept. 9, 1986, a caller to a Western
news agency claimed the American was a CIA spy.
   Reed's family called the espionage charge ridiculous, saying
Reed had no interest in politics. ``I don't even think he's a
registered voter,'' said nephew Ken Reed.
   A former Lebanese reporter, Tewfik Mishlawi, now working at the
Center for Foreign Journalists in Reston, Va., said: ``He was
apolitical and had friends all over the country.''
   Mishlawi said Beirut's cycle of terror kept Reed's new school
from flourishing. But, said Reed's older brother Edward, ``he
thought it was a challenge to be there. He thought he was doing
good there.''

<HEAD>Task Force Criticizes Probe into Murders of Salvadoran Jesuits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation into last year's murders of
six Salvadoran Jesuit priests has ground to a halt and is unlikely
to bring to justice all those responsible, a House Democratic task
force charged Monday.
   The task force, appointed by Speaker Thomas Foley soon after the
Nov. 16 murders, issued a harshly critical report that appeared
likely to fuel opposition to new U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
   ``As of mid-April, the investigation and preparations for
prosecuting the case have come to a virtual standstill,'' reported
the 19-member group, made up primarily of liberal Democrats opposed
to Bush administration policy toward El Salvador.
   Nine military officials were charged following the murders _ an
unusual step in El Salvador, where death squads with military
involvement have been carrying out executions for the past decade
with apparent legal impunity.
   But while the task force gave credit to President Alfredo
Cristiani for pushing the investigation forward, it said key
questions remain unasked and that investigators and the judge in
the case appear reluctant to pursue leads that could lead to
involvement of higher-ups.
   ``This lack of continued progress, coupled with certain aspects
of Salvadoran law, make it less likely that full justice will be
done,'' the report concluded, adding that the failures are
symptomatic of deep institutional problems in the military and the
system of justice.
   Task force leader Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said he expected
the report to bolster opponents of U.S. military aid to El
Salvador. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week approved a
provision that would cut the $85 million annual aid in half, and
make the remaining aid contingent on progress toward peace at
United Nations-sponsored talks by both the government and the
leftist FMLN rebels.
   Those charged in the murders are members of the elite
U.S.-trained Atlacatl batallion.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said in an
interview that he believes military aid should be limited.
   ``I have grave reservations about continuing military aid,
especially at the current levels,'' Mitchell said. ``I favor
limitation and restriction of such aid in view of the tragedy that
has occurred in that country over the past several years .... There
has to be some change in our current policy.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has promised to seek
a new bipartisan approach to U.S. policy in El Salvador, was
scheduling meetings this week with congressional leaders to open
discussions.
   Miguel Salaverria, El Salvador's ambassador to the United
States, disputed the report's conclusion that the investigation had
stalled. He said Cristiani ``has a real concern that more
investigation should be made'' into rumors that top military
officials may be involved.
   But Salaverria added: ``Cutting (aid) now would be the wrong
time to do it. El Salvador has never been closer to peace than we
are at this moment.''
   He said he believed the murders came about because ``someone in
this whole thing succumbed to provocation,'' referring to rebel
attacks on family members of mayors and military officers.
   The task force also said those charged in the crime might never
have been arrested if a U.S. military officer _ an Army major
assigned to the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador _ had not come forward
in January with information implicating Col. Alfredo Benavides, the
most senior official charged.
   The task force said it was ``very disappointed'' by the failure
of the investigating unit to look seriously into whether superiors
to Benavides may have ordered or known about plans for the murders.
The judge handling the case, Ricardo Zamora, also has seemed at
times uninterested in pursuing the case vigorously, the group
reported.
   ``Even today, a series of questions about the possible
involvement of higher officials in ordering the crimes remain
unanswered and, as far as can be determined, unasked,'' the report
stated.

   The B-2 Stealth bomber has resumed flight
testing after a five-month respite, the Pentagon announced Monday.
   The radar-evading aircraft took off from Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., Friday morning and reached an airspeed of 325 knots and an
altitude of 35,000 feet before touching down later in the
afternoon, an announcement said.
   ``I've very pleased with the flight tests results,'' Maj. Gen.
Dick Scofield, the director of the B-2 program, said in a statement.
   Scofield called the six-hour, five-minute flight ``an especially
remarkable achievement'' in light of the five-month layup for the
plane.
   During that time, the aircraft was virtually pulled apart to
check it after its initial test flights. Changes were made in the
software in the plane's nose-wheel steering, environmental control
system and pilot displays, the statement said.
   The Pentagon said the aircraft is expected to make five to seven
more flights before going into a second planned layup and
preparation for the final tests of its stealth capabilities.
   A second B-2 is scheduled to make its first flight later this
year, the statement said.
   Bowing to congressional budget pressure and the reduced Soviet
threat, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced last week that the
Pentagon intends to sharply reduce the proposed purchase of bombers
from 132 to 75.
   That smaller purchase is expected to drive up the cost of the
plane from $530 million to $815 million each because of higher
production costs.

<TEXT>
   Five more manufacturers of a type of infant
pillow linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 children joined a
nationwide recall of the items Monday, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission announced.
   The recalls expand the number of recalled pillows to nearly one
million. They came 11 days after the agency announced voluntary
recalls by eight other manufacturers and retailers involving
644,000 of the ``bean bag'' style fabric-covered cushions sold
under several brand names. The cushions are filled with polystyrene
pellets.
   The latest recall included Comfort Products of Dallas, which
commission officials said had resisted the initial recall.
   Jacqueline Jones-Smith, CPSC chairwoman, said 19 infants 3
months old or younger had been ``found dead lying stomach-down'' on
the cushions since September 1987. The latest three deaths were
last January and February, she said. Ten occurred last year.
   The soft pillows conform to the baby's shape and could engulf a
child placed face down on them, the CPSC said.
   On March 6, the commission issued a warning urging parents to
discontinue use of the pillows, but it did not move to ban the
pillows because such action can take longer than voluntary recalls,
said CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt.
   The commission said consumers should immediately stop using the
products and contact the manufacturer for any exchange that might
be available.
   The new batch of recalls and the manufacturers included:
   _``Comfort Tote,'' ``Comfy Tote'' and ``Cushie Comfort'' by
Comfort Products; 133,800 have been sold.
   _``Baby's Cloud'' by U.S. Mom's of Las Vegas; the CPSC says
these products should be destroyed because the manufacturer is out
of business; about 3,500 were sold between 1985 and 1988.
   _``Sof-Sak'' by MFP of Hays, Kan.; 76,000 were sold nationwide
from 1986 through February 1990.
   _``Comfort Cushion'' by Tailored Baby, Inc., San Fernando,
Calif.; approximately 78,000 were sold from 1988 through April 1990.
   _``Baby Jacks Bean Bag'' by Jumping-Jacks Shoes, Inc., Monett,
Mo., which manufactured about 45,000 sold in Jumping-Jacks Shoes
and other retail stores from 1985 through February 1990.
   The previously announced recalls were ``Mother's Helper'' by
Hollander Home Fashions of Newark, N.J., which announced its recall
in January; ``Gold Bug Support Sacks'' by Gold, Inc., of Denver;
``Cozy Cushions'' by Pinky Baby Products of Houston; ``Cozy Baby''
by Cozy Baby Products, Mount Vernon, N.Y.; ``Baby Minder'' by The
Fourth Little Pig of San Anselmo, Calif; ``Baby Sak'' by Baby Sak
of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and cushions sold by J.C. Penney Co. and
the Army and Air Force Exchange Service.
   The government's consumer affairs hotline, 1-800-638-2772,
provides automated information on individual recalls and takes
reports on incidents involving the cushions.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices at Farm Edge Higher in April, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products increased
0.7 percent from March to April, raising the overall commodity
index 2 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   But revisions showed the department's ``prices received'' index
has declined about 2 percent from the record level set in January.
That included a decline in March instead of an increase shown by
the preliminary figures a month ago.
   According to the revisions, the index rose 3.4 percent in
January from its December average before dropping 1.3 percent in
each of the next two months.
   Prices of raw agricultural products can swing widely during a
single month, and for that reason and others are not considered
reliable indicators by themselves of overall food price trends at
the consumer level.
   Higher prices for oranges, corn, potatoes and cattle were mostly
responsible for the overall price increase from March, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary
report.
   Lower prices reported for tomatoes, milk, eggs and broilers
partly offset the gains for the other commodities. Most prices are
mid-April averages which will be revised next month.
   New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet
expenses were up 1.1 percent from January and averaged 3.4 percent
more than in April 1989.
   ``Since January, higher prices for feeder pigs and feeder cattle
and calves were moderated by lower fuel and energy prices,'' the
report said.
   Prices of cars and trucks, farm chemicals, tractors and
self-propelled machinery were generally up from last year's
surveys. Most retail seed prics were lower than a year ago.
   Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990
may be in the range of $54 billion to $58 billion, compared with
about $53 billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $45 billion to $49
billion, compared with $49 billion last year.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA economists to rise 3
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 5.7
percent in 1989, the sharpest rise since 1981.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the April price index for
livestock and poultry dropped 1.2 percent from March but still
averaged 9.7 percent more than a year ago.
   Milk prices dropped an additional 60 cents in April to an
average of $13.10 per l00 pounds. Even so, the preliminary April
price was up 70 cents from April 1989. The farm price of milk rose
to a record $16 per hundredweight in December.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 3.1 percent from March but averaged 7
percent below the year-earlier level. Fruit prices, led by oranges
and grapefruit, were up 11 percent from March and by the same
margin of 11 percent from a year ago.
   The index for commercial vegetables dropped 13 percent from
March and averaged 28 percent below the year-earlier level,
reflecting abundant tomato supplies and low prices.
   Tomato prices were reported at $16 per 100 pounds, down from
$32.80 in March and $55.80 in April 1989. Onions, however, rose to
$23 per 100 pounds from $19.60 in March and $10.90 a year earlier.
   Prices of potatoes and dry beans, which are measured
collectively, increased 14 percent from March to April and were up
13 percent from a year earlier.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $75 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
up from $74.20 in March and $70.10 in April 1989. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $52.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $51.30 in
March and $36.90 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.52 a bushel, was up from $2.37 in March but was
just short of the $2.56 year-earlier average.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.51 per bushel, compared with $3.49 in March and $4.03 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.26 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.50 in
March and $6.74 in April 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.62 per bushel, compared with $5.65 in March
and $7.29 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 64.8 cents per pound, up from
64.1 in March and 58.7 a year earlier.
   _Eggs were 71.4 cents per dozen, compared with 79.3 in March and
66.1 in April 1989.
   _Milk was $13.10 per 100 pounds, down from $13.70 in March but
above the average of $12.40 a year ago.
   _Broilers were 33.2 cents per pound, live weight, down from 36.4
cents in March and from 39.1 cents a year earlier.

<HEAD>High Court Gives States, Consumers Tool to Challenge Completed
Mergers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 8th graf: ``California's attorney,'' with state
reaction</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court gave state governments and
consumers a potential pocketbook victory Monday, saying they may
use federal antitrust law to try to break up corporate mergers.
   The unanimous decision empowers California officials to
challenge a $2.5 billion merger of the Lucky and Alpha Beta
supermarket chains.
   If the state wins its lawsuit and splits up the business deal,
officials said California consumers could save $440 million a year
in grocery bills.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said any
opponent of a merger _ not just the federal government _ has the
right to sue to force divestiture of merged businesses.
   The ruling, however, does not give states and individuals the
same sweeping power enjoyed by the federal government.
   Stevens said federal officials can force divestiture merely by
proving an antitrust violation but said, ``A private litigant ...
must prove threatened loss or damage to his own interests in order
to obtain relief.''
   The decision sends the supermarkets merger case back to lower
courts where the state will try to prove the merger is illegal.
   California's attorney general, John Van de Kamp, said he was
delighted with the court's ruling: ``It's a great victory for
California's consumers, as well as consumers all over the country,
because this case is now national in its implications.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, in a separate concurring opinion,
said the California attorney general's office still faces some
hurdles at trial. The state knew of the impending supermarket
merger in early 1988 but waited months before it sued, he said.
   Kennedy noted that the Federal Trade Commission permitted the
merger and that the break-up will ``upset labor agreements and
other matters.''
   ``These considerations should bear upon the ultimate disposition
of the case,'' he said.
   It was widely assumed before Monday's decision that states and
private citizens could prevent anti-competitive business
combinations but could not interfere once such deals were completed.
   But Stevens said the Clayton Act, passed in 1914 when Congress
was preoccupied with trust-busting on a national scale, can be a
weapon even against a completed merger.
   Lucky, California's largest supermarket chain, and Alpha Beta,
the fourth largest, operate some 600 stores in the state.
   Alpha Beta's parent company, American Stores, acquired Lucky in
June 1988 to merge the two chains under the Lucky name. American
has 1,500 stores in 40 states, while Lucky's operations are in
seven Western and Midwestern states.
   American Stores said California customers would save more than
$40 million a year because of increased efficiency. But state
officials said the merger would drive other competitors out of
business and would lead to $440 million in higher grocery prices
each year.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon in Los Angeles temporarily
blocked the merger in 1988, and ordered separate operation of the
two chains pending further litigation.
   But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the judge's
ruling and lifted the break-up order.
   The appeals court said the state could have prevented the merger
had it sued quickly enough, but could not dissolve the completed
business deal.
   Monday's decision overturned the appeals court ruling.

   It's the end of the road for ``Driving Miss
Daisy.''
   The Pulitzer prize-winning play about the relationship between
an elderly white woman and her black chauffeur will close June 24
after an off-Broadway run of 1,219 performances, David Powers, a
spokesman for the show, said Monday.
   The comedy, written by Alfred Uhry and which now stars Frances
Sternhagen and Arthur French, is off-Broadway's fourth longest
running play.
   The movie version, with Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, won
the Academy Award for best picture in March. Freeman was in the
play's original cast, along with Dana Ivey who played Miss Daisy.
Miss Tandy won a best actress Oscar for her screen performance.

<HEAD>Judge Won't Step in to Quiet Bands in French Quarter's Jackson
Square</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artists and shop owners driven to distraction
by loud brass bands blaring Dixieland jazz in the heart of the
French Quarter lost their fight Monday to establish court-ordered
quiet.
   State Judge Richard Ganucheau rejected a request that he order
police to enforce New Orleans anti-noise ordinances in Jackson
Square, an area of stone sidewalks and greenery between the
quarter's St. Louis Cathedral and the Mississippi River.
   Novelty shops, bars and artists who set up booths on the
sidewalks cater to tourists in the area, as do street musicians who
collect money thrown into their hats or empty instrument cases.
   At a hearing Friday, a city attorney argued that city police
already try to enforce the anti-noise ordinances by using decibel
meters. But, he said, the offending bands play more softly when
they know they are being monitored.
   The Association of Businessmen and Artists of Jackson Square
argued that more police manpower and more discreet use of the
meters would help.
   Police say they do the best they can with the manpower available.
   Ganucheau said in his written ruling Monday that it wasn't up to
him to tell police how to allocate their resources.
   ``This court finds that it does not have the authority to direct
the superintendent of police in his method of enforcing the
municipal noise ordinance,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>13-Year Study Says TV Makes Viewers Moody, Unable to Concentrate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's couch potatoes say
watching television is mindless, boring, addictive and takes less
concentration than any activity short of sleep.
   Americans will spend an average of two hours per day, the
equivalent of seven years over a lifetime, sitting in front of the
tube, according to a 13-year study of viewers released Monday.
   Viewers in the study reported their hours in front of the tube
made them feel worse rather than better. But like drug users
struggling to kick an unwanted addiction, they have a hard time
pulling the plug.
   ``A viscous cycle can develop wherein viewing begets more
viewing,'' said the study's co-author, Robert Kubey, a Rutgers
University psychologist. ``Both the realization and escape that
television so readily provides also leads many viewers to become
dependent on the medium.''
   Kubey and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi of the University of Chicago
published their findings in a book, ``Television and the Quality of
Life: How Viewing Shapes Everyday Experience.''
   And while many turn to the tube to feel better, they usually
wind up feeling worse after a dose of news, cop shows and sitcoms.
Viewers said they become more drowsy, bored, sadder, lonelier and
hostile the more they watch.
   The misery is a sort of family activity, the researchers found.
   ``While television generally increases the total time that
family members spend together, it tends to reduce their interaction
with one another and they spend a disproportionate amount of this
time together in a passive mode,'' Kubey said.
   Spokesmen from ABC and NBC said they were looking at information
from the study and weren't ready to comment. A CBS spokeswoman did
not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.
   Howard Gardner, a psychologist at Harvard University, said the
project is seen as one of the most inclusive analyses on the
effects of television among thousands of studies on the medium.
   To assess viewing patterns and the impact they have on mood, the
researchers said they looked at viewers in a different way than in
previous studies.
   Instead of asking them to recall events or take tests in a
laboratory, Csikszentmihalyi and Kubey asked 1,200 people, ranging
from age 10 to 82, to carry beepers and to write down how they felt
every time it went off.
   ``Basically,'' Csikszentmihalyi said, ``we collected a series of
snapshots of what people were doing and how they felt at the time.
... We were thus able to map moods and patterns of behavior that
may have eluded the subjects themselves.''
   The researchers discovered a perverse sort of benefit from the
TV-induced trance:
   ``Certainly it can be argued that using television in this
manner habitually is no worse, and may indeed be better, than
habitually using alcohol or other mood-altering substances.''

   Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin was
taken to a hospital Monday with a slipped disc and was to undergo
back surgery, regional television said.
   The outspoken Soviet Congress deputy, who has a history of heart
trouble, arrived in Barcelona Sunday night and was to have appeared
on a television panel show Monday.
   The television, TV-3, said Yeltsin would be operated on at
Barcelona Hospital.
   TV-3 said Yeltsin had complained of back pains during the day
Monday and had canceled a scheduled news conference and meeting
with Catalan officials.
   Yeltsin, 59, a former Moscow party chief, began to gather mass
support in 1987, when he spoke out for a faster pace of Soviet
reforms. He was ousted from his Moscow post as a consequence.
   Yeltsin's autobiography, ``Against the Grain,'' was recently
published in the West, and describes other periods of ill health.
Yeltsin has been hospitalized frequently in the Soviet Union.
   Most recently, he missed part of the Soviet Congress session in
early March, and friends said his heart was acting up again.

<HEAD>Former Senator Agrees to Pay Abscam Fine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr. of New
Jersey has agreed to pay off $47,000 remaining from his 1981 fine
for bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam case, his attorney said
Monday.
   ``We believe by the end of this summer, his fine will be paid in
full,'' John D. Arsenault said from his office in Roseland, N.J.
   Dick Lavinthal, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
New Jersey, declined to comment.
   Rep. John J. Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., said the Justice Department
had told him of an agreement by which Williams would pay the rest
of his $50,000 penalty. Duncan had asked the Justice Department
last year to consider recovering the money from Williams' federal
pension.
   ``Sen. Williams apparently had a change of heart after I prodded
the Justice Department,'' Duncan said.
   But Arsenault said: ``His intention was always to pay it off.
There has never been a question about that. Contrary to popular
belief, he doesn't have $50,000 laying around in a closet
someplace. He does not have any appreciable assets.''
   However, the attorney declined to say how Williams, a volunteer
at a drug crisis center in Newark, N.J., ``with no other earned
income'' would find the money to repay his fine.
   ``I presume there may be some debt involved in paying this
off,'' he said.
   Arsenault said that as of February, ``arrangements already had
been made to satisfy the obligation'' through negotiations with the
U.S. attorney's office.
   According to Arsenault, Williams has cooperated with the Justice
Department since his release from prison in 1986.
   Williams was released on good behavior after serving two years
of concurrent two-year and three-year sentences for bribery,
conflict of interest and conspiracy in the Abscam sting.
   In Abscam, undercover agents posing as middlemen for Arab sheiks
made a deal with Williams. He agreed to accept a hidden interest in
a Virginia titanium mine in return for helping to find military
contracts for the venture, according to evidence from his trial.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins For Man Accused Of Poisoning Tree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection began Monday for the trial
of a man who faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted of
poisoning a famous, centuries-old oak tree.
   Paul Stedman Cullen, 46, is accused of pouring the herbicide
Velpar around the base of the Treaty Oak, where, according to
folklore, Stephen F. Austin signed a treaty with Indians in the
1820s. Austin is regarded as the father of Texas.
   The poisoning was discovered Memorial Day. Half of the 60-foot
tree has died, despite $100,000 in donations and herculean efforts
to save it, officials have said.
   The act shocked residents and touched people around the country.
Many sent get-well cards to the tree or stopped to write messages
and leave tokens at its base.
   Workers have severed the most severely affected roots and have
injected sugar water in hopes of diluting the poison.
   Cullen, of Elroy, was charged with felony criminal mischief and
has been in jail without bail for more than 10 months. He could be
sentenced to life in prison if convicted because he has a prior
burglary conviction.
   Police and prosecutors have never detailed the suspected motive.
When Cullen was arrested on June 29, 1989, an arrest warrant
alleged the poisoning was part of a ``ritual.''
   Sgt. John Jones, who investigated the case, refused to elaborate.
   The Austin American-Statesman reported before his arrest that a
suspect in the case was trying to cast a spell in a romantic matter.
   Said Jones: ``The occult's really got nothing to do with it.
He's charged with damaging the tree ... Normally what we have to
prove is intentionally and knowingly damaging property. We don't
necessarily have to prove why he did it.''
   Attorneys expect the trial to last about two weeks.
   Cullen also could face up to 15 years in prison for federal
charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and making a false
statement to a firearms dealer. The charges stem from a .22-caliber

<TEXT>
   President Bush annnounced on Monday a $200
million ``growth fund'' _ including $50 million from the U.S.
government _ to help move eastern Europe away from its communist
system.
   The $50 million will come from the government's Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (OPIC), one of its few profit-making
agencies. For the year that ended last September, the corporation
turned over $122 million to the Treasury. It earned the money
largely by insuring Americans against hostile acts to their
property in other countries.
   ``For democracy's sake, we've got to do all we can to help this
transition take place,'' Bush told the annual meeting of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
   Private U.S. investors are expected to supply the remaining $150
million. The government corporation will insurethem against having
their money blocked or confiscated, and against war and violence in
the countries where the fund will be active.
   James V. Hall, the corporation's spokesman, said the fund should
be operating in about six months, beginning with help for private
investors in Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia. Later Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania and East Germany are expected to become eligible.
The Soviet Union is not excluded, Hall added.
   He said the fund probably will be managed by a U.S. institution,
and will earn 10 to 15 percent a year for investors. The government
corporation will not insure the earnings, only the right of the
investors to take their money back home, Hall explained.
   Private companies in the eastern European countries will be able
to borrow from the fund, and it will buy small quantities of their
stock. As a result, the U.S. government will become partial,
indirect owner of many private companies in countries which until
last year were under communist rule.

<HEAD>Engineers Fix Antenna Movement on Space Telescope</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA engineers got the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope working Monday with the help of
a model built with a piece of lamp cord and plastic sticks from a
toy store.
   The model helped engineers visualize what was jamming one of the
primary antennas on the telescope, which was put into a 381-mile
high orbit last Wednesday by astronauts on the space shuttle
Discovery.
   Analysis showed that one of the telescope's high-gain antennas
was jammed when it brushed against an electrical cable that was too
long by about an inch.
   ``We are still investigating it to understand how did this
really happen, why did it happen, why didn't we catch it?'' said
Jean Olivier, one of the top NASA officials on the project. ``We're
not through with that investigation.''
   By Tuesday evening, the telescope should be in a condition where
calibration and other normal start-up work can begin, said Mike
Harrington, director of the troubleshooting team.
   The antenna jammed on Friday when engineers were running it
through its paces. Sensing something wrong and trying to prevent
damage, the telescope's computer shut down the whole system. The
telescope's two high-gain antennas are designed to transmit science
data to two orbiting relay satellites at very high speeds _ up to
the equivalent of a 30-volume encyclopedia in 42 minutes.
   ``For a while we were puzzled as to the data we were receiving
from the spacecraft and therefore lacked a clear understanding
physically of what the problem was with the high gains,'' Olivier
said. ``All that has significantly changed.''
   Detective work by NASA and its contractor teams led to an
understanding of the problem.
   While studying pre-launch photographs of the telescope nestled
in the cargo bay of space shuttle Discovery, an engineer noticed
that an inch-thick electrical cable on the back of the antenna was
slightly out of position.
   Olivier said the length of the cable was determined by computer
simulations and turned out to be an inch or so too long. The
antenna movement could not be tested on Earth because the motors
are not powerful enough to move the antenna in the presence of
gravity.
   From the photographs, engineers decided the too-long loop had
shifted over to one side. With that clue, engineers looked over
their telemetry data again and reasoned that counterweights began
to run against the cable when the antenna was turned into certain
positions.
   ``We were faced with a problem that involved quite intricate
geometry,'' said David Skillman, an engineer at NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center. He drove to a toy store and bought two boxes
of a well-known construction set. In another store he got an
extension cord, knife, masking tape and glue.
   He and engineer John Decker assewmbled the model in 15 minutes.
``This is how we determined if it was the cable that was the
problem,'' Skillman said. ``Sure enough, when we set the models to
angles on our computer screen, we could see the interference in the
antenna parts and cable.''
   NASA has plenty of models of the telescope, but they are big,
fragile and unsuitable for that kind of demonstration, said NASA
spokeswoman Janet Ruff.
   ``We determined that there was a proper motion that we should
carry this antenna through to bring it carefully away, in the right
direction so it wouldn't upset the control system,'' Olivier said.
``We successfully did that and we are all relieved to know that our
theories were correct.''
   The antennas, shaped like a dish, are at the end of masts and
the cable is coiled along the length, terminating in the loop. One
motor causes them to look up and down, 90 degrees in each
direction. The other _ the one that had problems _ looks left and
right.
   The antennas send their signal to one of two Tracking and Data
Relay Satellites orbiting Earth and store their information on tape
recorders when they are not in communication with the satellites.
Because of that, said Olivier, the slight limits on the antenna's
movement to avoid contact with the cable will have only a small
impact.
   The first test image from the telescope had been expected by
Tuesday but now is delayed until the weekend, Harrington said.
   The telescope, named after the famed astronomer Edwin Hubble,
was carried into space by space shuttle Discovery and released into
a 381-mile high orbit last Wednesday. Its mission is to look back
in time for some 14 billion years, when the universe was young.
   Meanwhile, NASA said Discovery, which landed on Sunday at
Edwards Air Force Base, sustained only minimal damage to its
heat-protecting tiles. It is scheduled to be returned to the
Kennedy Space Center at the end of the week.

<HEAD>Researchers: Early Egyptian Women Forged Fidelity From Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women loaning men money is commonplace
nowadays, but in first-century Egypt that meant marriage.
   University of Michigan researchers recently deciphered documents
suggesting women in ancient Egypt made short-term loans to their
prospective mates to guarantee their fidelity before and during
marriage.
   The 22 documents deciphered by classical studies Professor
Ludwig Koenen and two assistants recorded the business and legal
transactions of the Pausiris family. The family lived about 70 A.D.
in Oxyrhynchos, then a major city under Roman rule.
   The documents include several loan receipts made out to Dioskous
Pausiris by Thermouthis, his wife of one year.
   Thermouthis probably came from a lower-middle-class family and
couldn't afford a dowry to secure a marriage contract, Koenen said.
Such women instead obtained financial security by loaning their
fiances small amounts of money, he said.
   Researchers at the Ann Arbor school deciphered evidence that
Thermouthis loaned a small amount to Dioskous for two months
shortly before they married.
   Although none of the documents described the couple's personal
relationship, one _ a canceled loan receipt, dated about a year
after the marriage _ indicates Dioskous repaid a second, larger
loan, then got a divorce.
   ``Where did he get the money? Perhaps he had a good business
year, but a cynic would suspect that he had found another lady who
would give him a loan,'' Koenen speculated.
   The researchers' findings will be published this summer, the
university said.

<TEXT>
   West German leaders attempted Monday
to overcome Kremlin opposition to a united Germany belonging to
NATO as preparations got under way for historic unification talks.
   Experts from the two Germanys and the four victorious World War
II powers held closed-door procedural talks in East Berlin to
prepare for the formal ``two-plus-four'' negotiations at the
foreign ministers' level in Bonn.
   After six hours of talks, they issued a joint statement saying
that Poland's borders would be the first item discussed when the
foreign ministers from the six nations hold their first formal
talks on May 5 in Bonn.
   Poland is demanding guarantees that a united Germany will not
seek to reclaim former German lands ceded to Poland after World War
II.
   In a meeting Monday, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher assured Victor Karpov, the Soviet deputy foreign minister,
that Bonn would not overlook Moscow's ``justified security
interests.''
   Genscher told the Soviet official that German unification would
represent the ``solution of a serious European problem (the
division of Europe), and not the creation of a new one.''
   In an effort to make some headway before Saturday's
``two-plus-four'' talks, the West German government announced that
Genscher would hold separate meetings Friday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III.
   Baker will also meet Friday with West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, said West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel.
   Kohl indicated that West Germany was prepared to offer economic
and other incentives to the Soviet Union to overcome reservations
about German unification within NATO.
   Kohl, in a statement read by Vogel, said he is ``certain that we
will come to a reasonable agreement, also with the Soviet Union''
on the matter of a united Germany's strategic allegiances.
   Kohl added that West Germany is ``ready for comprehensive
cooperation with the Soviet Union in the areas of economy,
technological exchanges, athletic meetings ... and cooperation in
security questions.''
   Kohl's statement did not elaborate. West Germany is the Soviet
Union's largest trading partner in the West.
   In Bonn, East and West German negotiators tried to wrap up their
own talks on merging the economies of the two countries by July 2.
   East Germany is pressing West Germany to sweeten its proposed
terms for economic union, but the West Germans have indicated their
unwillingness to make further concessions.
   Despite the differences, Vogel told reporters the two Germanys
still intend to forge a basic economic agreement by Friday.
   On Saturday, foreign ministers from East and West Germany and
the Soviet Union, France and Britain as well as Baker are to meet
in Bonn to try to iron out the thorny strategic problems raised by
German unification.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev reiterated the Soviet Union's opposition to
a united Germany's membership in NATO during a meeting Sunday in
Moscow with East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   The Soviet Union is concerned that a unified Germany within NATO
would upset the current European balance of power to Moscow's
disadvantage.
   Shevardnadze has signaled that Moscow was prepared to drop its
demand for a neutral unified Germany. He said the Soviet Union is
open to proposals for new European security structures, including a
proposal that a united Germany belong to both NATO and the Warsaw
Pact.
   West Germany and its NATO allies have insisted that a united
Germany must remain in the Western alliance.
   De Maizere was quoted in the East German Communist Party
newspaper Neues Deutschland on Monday as saying East Germany should
act as a mediator between the Soviet Union and the West on German
unification.
   East Germany has said it is willing to go along with temporary
NATO membership if the alliance undergoes fundamental changes
reflecting the East-West thaw by emphasizing political and economic
issues over its military role.

   Two Greenpeace activists climbed 150 feet up the
Georgia-Pacific building on Monday and unfurled a banner to protest
the company's use of chlorine in the manufacture of paper pulp.
   A 30-by-12 foot banner reading ``Take the Poison out of Pulp''
was unfurled after the climbers reached the 13th floor of the
52-story building about 8:30 a.m. The building was chosen because
Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific is the largest pulp operator in the
nation, a Greenpeace spokesman said.
   About 200 passers-by stopped to watch the five-hour protest,
which coincided with the release in Washington of an Environmental
Protection Agency report on dioxins found in bleached paper.
   The EPA said the amount of dioxin in such items as milk cartons
and toilet tissue is too small to pose a health hazard, but the
agency is concerned about dioxin contamination of waterways near
some paper mills.
   ``The issue is not dioxin, but chlorine. It is an unnecessary
raw material in paper production,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Brian
Hunt.
   ``Several European nations have already made the conversion to
non-chlorine bleaching processes that yield high-quality,
high-whiteness paper. We're here to encourage Georgia-Pacific to
take the chlorine out of pulp,'' he said.
   Beth Zoffmann, a Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman, said chlorine
produces only a minute quantity of dioxin and added, ``We believe
our products are safe.''
   Pointing up at the two protesters, she said, ``This creates a
far greater risk than the entire production of dioxin in pulp. They
are creating an unnecessary risk to themselves and the people on
the ground. There is no need for that showmanship type activity.''
   Police arrested the pair, identified by Greenpeace as D.J.
LaChappelle, 24 of Washington, D.C., and Laurel Greenberg, 31, of
Boston, after they descended. Police said they would be charged
with criminal trespass and reckless conduct, but no charges were
filed immediately.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Monday accused Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of missing an
important opportunity to move peace forward and scuttling Shamir's
own plan for talks with Palestinian Arabs.
   Baker leveled the criticism through his spokeswoman, Margaret D.
Tutwiler, as U.S.-Israeli differences over the failure to set up
Mideast negotiations deepened.
   Even so, the department spokeswoman said she assumed ``we will
pick up where we left off'' after Israel forms a new government
under Shamir or another Israeli leader.
   Vice President Dan Quayle also pledged U.S. perseverance. ``We
must and we will continue the Arab-Israeli peace process,'' he said
at a seminar on the superpowers' role in the Mideast.
   The Baker-Shamir rift broke into the open after the Israeli
government collapsed last month in disagreement over a U.S. formula
for holding talks with Palestinians.
   Shamir had proposed last May to hold elections among
Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza. The formula the prime
minister refused to endorse had been worked out by Baker over
months of negotiations with Israel, Egypt and, indirectly, the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Specifically, Shamir objected to having Palestinians who were
ousted from the West Bank or who resided in East Jerusalem in the
delegation. He is determined to have Israel retain the territory
that Jordan held from 1948 until its defeat in the 1967 Six-Day war.
   On Sunday, the prime minister said ``no one can expect us to
accept every proposal and every idea of the American secretary, be
what they may be.''
   Shamir also vowed to continue settling Jews on the West Bank and
in Gaza, which Egypt occupied until 1967. The Bush administration
has objected, saying the settlements are an obstacle to peace.
   ``We're perplexed by the prime minister's statement,'' Baker's
spokeswoman said.
   ``We've been working so closely with the government of Israel on
the peace process,'' Ms. Tutwiler said, reading from a prepared
statement.
   She said the Israeli government had asked the Bush
administration ``to find a Palestinian partner from the
territories'' to help implement Shamir's elections initiative.
   ``We were on the verge of accomplishing that objective,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said. ``In fact, we felt we were close to producing
Palestinians from the territories who were prepared to talk to
Israel about the elections in the territories.''
   Baker's formula ``would have enabled us to do this,'' the
spokeswoman said. ``So saying yes ... meant saying yes to the
government of Israel's plan, yes to Israeli-Palestinian dialogue
and yes to peace.''
   On the other hand, Ms. Tutwiler added: ``Continuing to say no
will give us very little to work with and will probably mean losing
an important opportunity to move peace forward.''
   Shamir is in the midst of trying to form a new government. It is
likely to be as hard-line as the fallen coalition with the dovish
Labor party.
   Still, Ms. Tutwiler said, ``We hope once the political situation
in Israel clarifies we can work with the government of Israel to
move ahead.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, characterized the rift as one between the Shamir and
Bush administration rather than a conflict between Israel and the
United States.
   The Bush administration has adopted a policy of ``trying to
crowd'' the Likud government, he said. If Peres were to form a
government, Aspin told the Mideast seminar, the U.S. ``rhetoric''
would stop.
   Meanwhile, Richard N. Haass, director of Middle East affairs at
the National Security Council, said Israel's internal political
problems ``raise a question about the government's willingness to
go along'' with the Shamir election initiative.
   ``But leaving it alone is not the answer,'' Haass said at an
academic seminar.
   Haass said the administration would press on with its attempt to
bring Israelis and Palestinians to the negotiating table because
the passage of time without any solution works against moderate
forces in the region.

   Amtrak would have to suspend passenger
rail service to Florida if a judge rules that it must quit dumping
sewage from moving trains, Amtrak's president testified Monday.
   W. Graham Claytor Jr., Amtrak's president and chief operating
officer, was the first witness as three days of hearings began
before U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton.
   Melton is to decide if the national railroad can be prosecuted
for dumping waste in northern Florida waterways.
   Amtrak appealed to federal court after a state jury found Amtrak
guilty in early December of four felony counts of commercial
littering into the St. Johns River and Rice Creek.
   Amtrak cars now serving Florida either drop waste directly on
the track or put it into a holding tank which is dumped when the
train reaches a speed of 25 mph, Claytor said.
   With the present equipment owned by Amtrak, Claytor said it
would be impossible for it to continue service into Florida if
Melton rules in favor of the state.
   ``There is no way to comply,'' he said.
   He testified the railroad is studying ways to modify existing
cars and plans to equip new cars so sewage won't be dumped on the
tracks.
   But that's a long-term solution which will require Congress to
appropriate money and would not address the short-term problem of
cars dumping waste, Claytor said.
   ``In today's environment, it is better not to do it at all, and
we agree and we are working on it,'' he said.
   Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer said in his opening
arguments that the issue is whether federal law pre-empts state law
and ``whether Amtrak can continue to indiscriminately dump raw
human sewage into Florida's waterways.''
   ``This court should deny Amtrak's efforts to derail the state
criminal prosecution and allow Florida's courts to interpret laws
designed to protect the waters of the state and the citizens who
use the waters,'' Bayer said in his trial brief.
   Edward Booth, an attorney representing Amtrak, said Amtrak is
not subject to Florida's laws prohibiting the disposal of waste
from trains. He argued that allowing the state to enforce its laws
would interfere with interstate commerce.
   Melton blocked a Jan. 18 criminal sentencing of the railroad
pending the outcome of this hearing. If Melton rules that state law
applies to Amtrak, the railroad could be subject to about $20,000
in fines.

   Heavy snow fell in Colorado and winter-like weather gripped
parts of the West and northern Plains on Monday. Light rain and
drizzle dampened much of the East Coast.
   Strong gusts of wind whipped parts of California and Arizona,
and light snow fell across the Sierra Nevada.
   Snow also fell across parts of North Dakota and northern
Minnesota.
   A gale warning was in effect for the northern California
coastline, and high winds swept the southwest corner of the
Sacramento Valley. There were wind gusts up to 49 mph at Travis Air
Force Base.
   The National Weather Service also predicted high winds in
southeastern Arizona.
   A flood warning remained in effect along the Red River in Texas
and lowland flooding continued in eastern Arkansas after heavy
rains last week. Waters were expected to fall below flood stage in
northwest and western Missouri beginning Monday, and rivers were
forcast to crest later in the week in Tennessee.
   In Colorado, a wet spring snowstorm dumped up to 18 inches at
Rye and almost 17 inches at Pueblo overnight Sunday. At least one
person was killed in the storm that brought much-needed
precipitation to the state.
   The body of Pearl Sutliffe, 58, was found buried in snow early
Monday in Fairplay after she disappeared while trying to round up
livestock with her husband late Sunday, according to the Park
County Sheriff's Department.
   A low-pressure system over California was responsible for heavy
winds in Arizona, and was expected to spread snow into New Mexico
on Tuesday. Heavy snow was possible for higher elevations, where a
winter storm watch was posted.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms developed Monday along a warm
front curving through Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina.
   Light rain and drizzle dampened the East Coast from northern
Virginia into New England.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation in the early
afternoon, and abundant sunshine brightened the Northwest.
   Winter-like weather swept into the northern Plains and upper and
middle Mississippi Valley, as temperatures were only in the 30s and
40s. Strong and blustery northwest winds howled across the region.
   Strong southerly winds prevailing just ahead of a cold front
crossed the upper Great Lakes region and kept temperatures in the
60s and 70s.
   Cool weather prevailed across the West. Temperatures varied from
the 30s in the northern Rockies to the 70s in the southwestern
deserts.
   The low on Monday for the Lower 48 was 12 degrees at Laramie,
Wyo.

<TEXT>
   Iran's anti-Western radicals have
criticized suggestions that Tehran consider opening direct talks
with Washington, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Monday.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Tehran's Kayhan daily
as saying in an editorial Sunday that any move toward dialogue with
the United States deviated from the teachings of Iran's late
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died of
cancer June 3.
   The comments followed the April 22 release of U.S. hostage
Robert Polhill, but came before Monday's freeing of hostage Frank
Herbert Reed. Both had been held by an Iranian-backed Shiite
faction in Lebanon.
   The editorial was commenting on a suggestion Vice President
Ataollah Mohajerani, in an article published in Tehren's Etelaat
daily Thursday, that proposals for direct U.S.-Iranian talks should
be considered by the Tehran government.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called
pragmatists, is seeking to end Iran's isolation and improve links
with the West and the media broadside underlined the opposition he
faces from Tehran radicals.
   Rafsanjani has been seeking to secure the release of Western
hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon.
   Polhill's release, the first freeing of a U.S. hostage in
Lebanon in more than three years, was seen as a victory for
Rafsanjani and a first step toward breaking the deadlock in
U.S.-Iranian relations.
   Veteran analyst Charles Snow wrote in Monday's edition of the
respected Middle East Economic Survey: ``The release of Mr. Polhill
is unmistakably a conciliatory gesture which should be rewarded
both for its own sake, unless the U.S. actually wishes to play into
the hands of the radicals in Tehran, and in order to encourage the
Iranians to do more of the same.
   ``The problem is, however, that Mr. Bush has also inherited an
iron-clad commitment not to trade for hostages, or at least not to
appear to do so, and must therefore try somehow to differentiate
between a reciprocal gesture ... and a quid pro quo.
   ``So far, Mr. Bush has responded with the standard litany,
saying ... `I don't trade for hostages','' Snow wrote.
   The Tehran Times, an English-language daily associated with
Rafsanjani, Sunday had quoted an unidentified Iranian official as
saying there had been ``extensive talks'' between Tehran and the
kidnappers.
   Kayhan warned any dialogue with the United States will mean
``burying'' the achievements of Khomeini's 1979 Islamic revolution
that toppled the pro-Western shah and a major retreat.
   It said Mohajerani's suggestion amounted to urging Tehran to
stop ``fighting against the arrogance,'' the word Iranians use to
describe the United States and its allies, and to bow down to the
Americans and the West.
   Re-establishing ties with the United States would signal
``accepting the rule of opponents of (Khomeini's) divine rule and
destroy the revolution,'' Kayhan declared.
   The radical Jomhuri Islami daily also lashed out at Mohajerani's
``deviation,'' IRNA reported.
   The leader of Iran's radicals, former interior minister Ali
AKbar Mohtashemi, wrote in a Kayhan commentary that Mohajerani's
article was ``begging for mercy from the Great Satan,'' a term some
Iranians use for the United States.
   Mohtashemi, who was elected to Parliament in December and has
sought to mobilize opposition to Rafsanjani, said the vice
president's article was ``irresponsible'' and advocated the ``death
of the Islamic revolution.''
   The former minister, who helped organize Shiite militants in
Lebanon in the early 1980s, cited ``U.S. crimes ... and plots to
overthrow the Islamic republic'' as proof of U.S. hostility.

   The crew that discovered the
wreck of the Titanic used a robot diver Monday to explore a War of
1812-era wreck in Lake Ontario _ and shared the expedition with
children across North America.
   The camera-equipped robot examined the Hamilton, a merchant
schooner that the British pressed into service as a warship.
   Students at 14 spots in the United States and Canada watched
satellite TV transmissions. A few students even got to try steering
the robot through a satellite link, using joysticks like those used
with computer games. It transmitted pictures to students watching
through satellite hookups at 14 locations in the United States and
Canada.
   Cannons, railings and the ship's elegantly carved figurehead
could be seen in the television transmission.
   Robert D. Ballard, the expedition's leader, said the ship's
state of preservation was remarkable.
   ``We can see the caulking in the planks,'' he said.
   The Hamilton and its sister ship, the Scourge, sank during a
storm on Aug. 8, 1813, killing 53 sailors. They had taken part in
several battles for the British against U.S. forces that invaded
southern Canada during the war.
   The wrecks remained undisturbed in 300 feet of water six miles
off St. Catharines, about 30 miles south of Toronto and less than
10 miles west of the U.S. border at Niagara Falls, until their
discovery in 1975.
   Since then, there have been several attempts to examine the
wrecks, including one by French explorer Jacques Cousteau. But none
were technologically advanced enough to reach them.
   The cold, fresh water helped keep the ships in much better
condition than most wrecks, said Shelley Lauzon, a project
spokeswoman.
   ``The wood on the Titanic is all gone because there are
wood-boring animals in salt water,'' Lauzon said. ``They're not
present here.''
   Ballard, director of the Center for Marine Exploration at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, led the 1985
expedition that discovered the wreck of the Titanic. The ocean
liner sank in the North Atlantic after ramming an iceberg in 1912.
   Ballard said Monday's examination of the Hamilton and the
Scourge was aimed more at teaching children about archaeology and
oceanography than at making startling new discoveries about the two
warships.
   ``We've had four students actually take control and operate the
vehicle beautifully,'' he said in an interview by ship-to-shore
telephone. ``That was the biggest technological feat.''
   The children controlled the robot with a joystick linked to the
system by satellite, Lauzon said. A computer program restricted the
robot's movements so the children could not damage it.
   Although there were no archaeological breakthroughs, the
expedition did reveal a number of details not known before, Ballard
said.
   The two-week expedition will prepare a comprehensive diagram of
both ships and could provide information allowing the city of
Hamilton, which has title to the wrecks, to decide whether they are
worth raising. Ballard said there appeared to be little damage that
would stand in the way of such an effort.
   ``There's no suggestion that they suffered any damage due to the
sinking itself,'' he said. ``They just got flooded and went down
very gently.''
   The museums taking part in the program were in Boston; Chicago;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt
Lake City; Sarasota, Fla.; Toronto; Victoria, British Columbia;
Washington; and Woods Hole.

   Five major opposition parties on
Monday threatened to boycott national elections and accused the
dominant National Salvation Front of harassing opposition activists.
   A joint communique by the opposition groups was released as
thousands of protesters rallied in central Bucharest for the ninth
consecutive day to demand the resignation of interim President Ion
Iliescu, whom they accused of monopolizing power and favoring
Communism.
   The statement warned, ``If the government does not take measures
to ensure democratic elections, our parties will be forced not to
participate in such rigged elections.''
   ``Our parties' activists have been violently attacked ... Our
newspapers and magazines do not reach their destinations,'' the
statement charged.
   ``The National Salvation Front, meanwhile, enjoys the
administrative, financial and technical means of the old ruling
structure,'' it said.
   The National Salvation Front took power after a December
revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The
Front continues to dominate an interim governing coalition and
Parliament.
   The statement was signed by the National Peasants' Party, the
National Liberal Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Free
Democratic Party and the Socialist Liberal Party.
   On Friday, Iliescu rejected demands to postpone elections,
scheduled for May 20, insisting that ``we have been living in a
provisional state for long enough.''
   Iliescu, a former Communist official who became a critic of
Ceausescu in recent years, called the accusation that he is a
neo-Communist ``an electoral maneuver.''
   He said he has had to persuade his supporters not to ``go over
to the square like a bulldozer, and wipe out'' the demonstration.
   On Monday, 4,000 protesters crowded in University Square, now
filled with makeshift tents and sleeping bags, as their protest
entered its ninth day.
   Stelian Tanase, a leader of the Group for Social Dialogue, a
regular speaker at the demonstration, accused Iliescu of ``offering
us Communism in a sweet box.''
   ``We want sweeping changes, not perestroika,'' boomed the
bearded Tanase, as the crowd roared its approval.
   Each night the protest has been capped with a rousing rendition
of what has become the demonstrators' anti-government anthem:
   ``Better a tramp than traitor,
   Better a hooligan, than a dictator,
   Better a ruffian than an (Communist Party) activist,
   Better dead than a Communist.''

<DATELINE>STORNOWAY, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Royal Air Force plane with 10
people aboard crashed into a hillside on a Scottish island Monday,
the coast guard said. No survivors were reported found.
   An RAF spokesman said he could not confirm the number killed
until all next of kin had been contacted.
   Rescuers said bodies were scattered over the hillside on South
Harris in the Hebrides island chain off the northwest coast of
Scotland. They did not report finding anyone alive.
   ``There was nothing we could do when we arrived,'' said
Stornoway fire officer John Norman Macdonald. ``It was all over
before anyone could get to the scene.''
   A yellow Sea King helicopter winched bodies aboard Monday night
to fly them to Stornoway, the chief town of the islands, where the
initial accident inquiry is to begin Tuesday.
   The Shackleton aircraft took off on an exercise from
Lossiemouth, on the northern Scottish mainland, said the coast
guard in Stornoway, the Hebrides capital.
   Tony Arden, the Stornaway coast guard duty officer, said three
rescue helicopters and fire engines raced to the scene at Maordal,
a hill near the village of Northton.
   He said there was a fire in the wreckage but it burned out on
its own.
   A witness, builder Kenny Mackay, said the wreckage was spread
over about 1{ miles.
   ``I heard the plane going over the village very low and then
there was a thundery noise ... You could feel a tremor shaking your
feet but we couldn't see anything because the hill was covered in
thick fog,'' he said.
   ``We went up to the hill and all we could see was burned heather
and bits of plane all over the place.''
   The Shackleton, a version of the wartime Lancaster bomber, is
used for long-range maritime patrols, and is part of Britain's
airborne early warning system.

   Toxic smoke from a fire at a plastics plant
kept firefighters at bay for several hours Monday and forced the
evacuation of at least 2,000 people, including nearly 150 nursing
home patients, authorities said.
   The fire at the Life-Like Products Inc. plant was still
smoldering at late afternoon, but air samples tested by Spiltech
Inc. of Little Rock found conditions were safe, said Franklin
County Sheriff Gordon McCain. He said people were told they could
return home at about 2 p.m.
   No injuries were reported.
   The fire was reported about 6:45 a.m. Firefighters began dousing
the fire but had to pull back after about 45 minutes, when their
air tanks ran out, state police spokesman Mack Hayden said.
   A team with air equipment from Fort Chaffee arrived later in the
morning, he said. Until then, emergency officials had to watch the
fire from a makeshift headquarters on a hill about a quarter mile
from the blaze.
   The cause of the fire was not yet known, McCain said. He said
damage caused by the fire, which destroyed the plant, probably will
run into the millions of dollars.
   The entire west side of the town of about 4,000 was evacuated,
said Gary Talley of the Office of Emergency Services.
   That included about 1,400 public school students and 350
students at the Arkansas Valley Vocational Technical School.
   Authorities said most of the 155 residents of the Ozark Nursing
Home and more than 50 patients at Mountain View Lodge, a private
center for mentally handicapped people, were taken to a school
gymnasium about five miles from town. Other evacuees were taken to
churches, officials said. McCain said about a dozen bed-bound
nursing home residents were not moved.
   Plant manager Gary Key said the plant made polystyrene packaging
materials. He said some of those products are made using pentane
gas, the flammable material that most concerned emergency workers
Monday.
   ``This stuff is not real toxic,'' said McCain.
   ``At first they thought it was,'' he said. ``What happened is,
the records of what to do in case of fire were in (the plant) and
they burned up. They ended up not knowing what to do.''
   The Ozark Fire Department and a hazardous materials team from
Fort Chaffee entered the remains of the gutted plant in the
afternoon afternoon wearing air masks, said Hayden. They erected a
dike to stop any toxic material from running out of the
52,000-square-foot plant and into nearby Gar Creek, officials said.
   Key said 33 people work at the 52,000-square-foot factory.

<HEAD>Shamir Says He Will Try to Form Rightist Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Monday he will seek a narrow center-right coalition as he attempts
to form Israel's next government and will not ask the left-leaning
Labor Party to join.
   In the past, Shamir, head of the right-wing Likud bloc, has
advocated a ``national unity government'' with Labor, mainly
because such a broad coalition reduced the leverage of small
ultra-rightist and religious parties.
   Also Monday, Israel's 42nd Independence Day, leaders of a
growing electoral reform campaign met with President Chaim Herzog
and presented him with 501,000 signatures of Israelis backing the
drive. Israel has a population of 4.6 million.
   The meeting came after Herzog issued a strong call for electoral
reform and said Israeli politicians have shown ``total contempt for
the principles of democracy'' in their quest to rule.
   In parks, forests and on Mediterranean beaches, millions of
Israelis celeberated Independence Day with picnics and barbecues.
Police reported massive traffic jams, and Israel radio said
recreation sites were filled.
   This year's Independence Day found the country plagued by
political divisions and unable to form a strong government since
the March 15 collapse of a Likud-Labor coalition.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres failed last week to form a governing
coalition, and Herzog on Friday asked Shamir to try.
   ``Under the current conditions, I don't see a chance to form a
government with Labor,'' Shamir told Israel radio in an interview
broadcast Monday.
   ``I'm certain that a rightist government headed by me, even if
it is a minority government, will have more success in advancing
peace than a government that includes leftist factions that openly
advocate the establishment of a Palestinian state,'' Shamir said.
   Shamir and his right-wing allies reject proposals by Secretary
of State James A. Baker III that would provide the framework for
preliminary Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo. Shamir says
he fears the talks could lead to indirect Palestine Liberation
Organization participation in negotiations.
   Under Baker's plan, the two sides would discuss Shamir's
proposal to hold elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Those elected would negotiate the final status of the
occupied lands with Israel.
   On Monday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told
reporters that the U.S. government was ``perplexed'' by Shamir's
rejection of Baker's efforts.
   ``Continuing to say no will give us very little to work with and
will probably mean losing an important opportunity to move peace
forward,'' she said.
   Shamir currently has the backing of 61 members in the 120-member
Parliament. Labor Party legislator Ephraim Gur told Israel
Television on Monday night that he might move over to the Likud
camp, broadening Shamir's support.
   Last month's defection and re-defection of several legislators
lured by offers of political jobs from Labor and Likud has angered
many Israelis and sparked an electoral reform campaign. Many
Israelis want a change in the system of proportional representation
to reduce the influence of small, religious parties.
   Several thousand demonstrators staged a protest rally in front
of Parliament on Monday to push for a new political system.
   Herzog dedicated a major part of his traditional Independence
Day speech Sunday night to the subject.
   ``How can citizens who have the democratic right to choose their
representatives watch calmly the political phenomena revealing a
total contempt for the principles of democracy,'' he said.
   ``I want to use this opportunity and appeal to the political
leaders ... not to ignore the voice of the people,'' Herzog said.
   The president did not specify what system he favored, and warned
that reform ``is not a wonder drug that will remove all the
troubles from our public life.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of extra police were deployed
Monday in both Berlins ahead of feared May Day riots, as the city
prepared for its first joint celebration of the holiday since the
Berlin Wall came down.
   Union organizers said they expect up to 50,000 people from both
sides of the city to attend the festivities Tuesday.
   Police forces in East Berlin and West Berlin will each have
3,000 extra officers on the job, and West Berlin police said they
will be prepared with water cannons and tear gas.
   The main May Day event will be a celebration in front of the
former Reichstag, or parliament building, in West Berlin.
   For the last three years, May 1, the international workers
holiday, has been marked by clashes between the city police and
youth gangs, foreigners and extremists.
   Last year some 2,000 rioters ramapged through the streets of
West Berlin, smashing windows and cars and looting grocery stores
and other businesses. More than 300 police officers, demonstrators
and passers-by were injured.
   Last week, hundreds of right-wing ``skinheads'' and leftist
extremists rampaged in East Berlin and police fear that
troublemakers from both sides of the city will join forces Tuesday.
   ``We'll do our best to see that violent people don't cross the
border,'' West Berlin police spokesman Gernot Piestert told The
Associated Press. ``We'll search anyone who looks suspicious.''
   Skinheads and youths in black leather will be special targets,
Piestert said. Skinhead is a popular term for right-wing extremist
youths with close-shaven heads.
   Piestert said the police will, however, not close any of the
more than 35 border checkpoints between East and West Berlin, which
Germans can cross after presenting a valid passport.
   ``We're too happy about the borders being open to close them
now,'' Piestert said.
   The Berlin Wall and the rest of East Germany's western border
were opened in November 1989.
   For the first time police in both Berlins will cooperate to
ensure security for the holiday.
   Three officers from each side will cross the border to provide
smooth communication between the two countries' forces.
   Klaus Schattat, a police chief in East Berlin, warned:
``Everybody can rely on the fact that police in both halves of the
city will work, together when necessary, against all forms of
violence, vandalism and rowdyism.''

   A 2,000-foot-wide river of lava from
Kilauea Volcano destroyed another house Monday as it threatened to
bury and burn the center of this coastal community.
   Kilauea, the world's most active volcano, was pumping all of its
daily output of 650,000 cubic yards of molten rock into the
Kalapana area on Hawaii Island, and authorities had little hope the
community would survive.
   ``This is a massive glacier of lava, at least a quarter of a
mile wide, at least 10 to 40 feet high behind the front of the
flow,'' said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim.
   Kilauea has destroyed 120 homes since its latest eruption began
Jan. 3, 1983, 44 of them in April.
   Lava was a quarter-mile from the Kalapana Store and Drive-In and
two churches in the town center, which Kim said could be overrun by
Tuesday at the earliest.
   Walter Yamaguchi, who built the store in 1974, said he was
content to leave the fate of his business in the hands of God and
the volcano goddess Pele.
   ``In fact, Madame Pele owns the whole place. So I believe in her
and I believe in God,'' the 82-year-old man said. ``I leave it up
to the good Lord whether I win. I leave it up to heaven.''
   Parishioners made plans to move the historic Star of the Sea
Church, which sits on an oceanfront lot in the direct path of the
lava. A trucking company volunteered to move the church for free.
Volunteers began removing the church's stained glass windows Friday.
   Robert Lippi, chief financial offer for the Roman Catholic
Diocese in Honolulu, said church officials would wait until lava
was certain to overrun the church before moving it.
   ``It looks pretty inevitable,'' he said.
   Leaders of Kalapana Mauna Kea Congregational Church, located
across the street from Star of the Sea, said the church's structure
was rotten from termites and not worth saving.
   They said some artifacts and a church bell made in the 1800s
would be the only things salvaged.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying ``things seem to be
moving,'' hailed the release Monday of a second American hostage in
Lebanon but said there could be no rest ``until all hostages are
free.''
   ``I hope this is a forerunner to the release of the other
American hostages and the others from other countries held against
their will,'' Bush said.
   Bush spoke as he welcomed former hostage Robert Polhill to the
White House. The meeting came just hours after another hostage,
Frank Reed, was turned over in Beirut to Syrian officials after 43
months of captivity.
   The president pointedly thanked Iran and Syria for their efforts
in winning the hostages' release. But he added that no one can
expect a return to normal relations ``or expect vast improvement
until all Americans are free.''
   ``I hope there's a realization that holding people against their
will is not the way to affect political change,'' Bush said.
   Asked if Israel ought to release a Shiite cleric, Sheik
Abdul-Karim Obeid, and others as demanded by a Tehran newspaper as
a next step, Bush said he would have ``no objections'' to such an
action.
   ``That is a matter for others to determine,'' he added.
   The State Department, in its annual report on terrorism released
Monday, criticized both Iran and Syria. Iran still uses terrorism
in pursuit of foreign policy goals, and Syria continued to support
a variety of terrorist groups, the report said.
   Polhill, accompanied by his wife Ferial, clasped Bush with both
hands in a warm handshake.
   Speaking in a raspy whisper, Polhill said he could not provide
any clues about the other six Americans still held hostage.
   ``You may be surprised, but I really don't know very much about
what was going on around me,'' Polhill said. ``The only thing I can
suggest is that the American people continue to show, as hostages
continue to be released on a regular basis, how much we are wanted
back.''
   Bush met with Polhill for an hour in the executive mansion,
accompanied by senior White House aides and the president's wife,
Barbara. ``He described his life in captivity and gave his
impressions of his captors, of the confusing situation in Beirut
and of the hardship he suffered during 3{ years,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The president took Polhill aside at one point to receive a
private message from his former kidnappers. Fitzwater said Bush
refused to reveal the contents of the message publicly.
   ``Apparently Polhill told his captors he would deliver a message
privately and personally to President Bush only,'' Fitzwater said.
``And that's what he did.''
   Bush and Polhill also talked by telephone briefly with Reed in
Damascus. Bush wished him well, and Polhill and Reed exchanged warm
greetings, Fitzwater reported.
   Bush said the meeting with Polhill came ``at a very special
moment'' because Reed had just been freed. The president said he
expected to talk soon with Reed by telephone in Damascus, Syria,
where he was taken.
   ``I do want to take this opportunity to thank Syria for its role
in not only bringing Mr. Polhill home but its role in the Reed
release, and similarly to Iran for its role,'' Bush said.
   Expressing hopes for release soon of the other hostages _ six
Americans and 10 other Westerners _ Bush said, ``Things seem to be
moving on this.''
   ``I can't explain the rationale but I can express a certain
gratitude that things seem to be moving. And what I feel in my
heart about the return of now these two Americans is, in a sense,
overwhelming.''
   ``But I don't think any American can totally rejoice until the
rest are free, and indeed we can't limit our concern and our
feelings to just the Americans, in my view.''
   Iran, meanwhile, said no more Americans would be released unless
the United States reciprocated with a gesture in line with Bush's
oft-stated promise that ``goodwill begets goodwill.''
   ``Now the ball is in the court of the U.S. and the Western
countries,'' said the English-language Tehran Times, considered
close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Asked if he was ready to make a goodwill gesture in return for
the hostages' release, Bush said all must be freed.
   ``We're not in a piecemeal basis, bidding for one human life,
holding out hopes, only to have them dashed for one American family
or another,'' he said.
   In a statement released earlier, after Reed's impending release
was announced, Bush said, ``We urge all parties who either hold
hostages or have any influence over the hostage takers to work for
the expeditious and unconditional release of the remaining
hostages.''
   The White House said it had made no deals to win Reed's freedom
but that Iran and Syria apparently were working to free the
hostages in hopes of improving relations with Washington.
   ``This is a joyous day for Mr. Reed, his family, his friends and
all Americans,'' Bush said in the written statement. However, in a
reference to the others still held, he said, ``Their predicament
weighs on our mind and tempers the joy we feel today.''
   Privately, U.S. officials said a key element of Bush's statement
was to applaud Iran for ``humanitarian'' action _ a description
also used by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. The officials
said Iran, after years of isolation from the West, was seeking
recognition for positive deeds.
   Even before Reed was released by his captors, a State Department
hostage reception team was dispatched to the U.S. hospital at
Wiesbaden, West Germany, to provide care and conduct debriefings.
Preparations began after a previously unknown group, the
Organization of Islamic Dawn, said on Sunday it would free Reed
within 48 hours.
   In Malden, Mass., an overjoyed Fifi Reed got the word from the
State Department and said she would fly to Germany to be with her

   Reed, director of the private Lebanon International School, had

   While asserting there had been ``no deals'' with the kidnappers,
spokesman Fitzwater said, ``we've had a number of discussions ...
with Syrian officials, with third countries who have relations or
have contacts with Iran and people in Lebanon.
   ``We've had a lot of third party intermediary kinds of messages
back and forth with Iran, but there's nothing we can point to in

<TEXT>
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
said Monday that Gen. Humberto Ortega will remain only temporarily
as chief of the armed forces and that she would hold talks with
Contra rebels who refuse to disarm.
   Many Contras balked at disarming after Mrs. Chamorro named Gen.
Ortega, brother of former Sandinista president Daniel Ortega, as
the armed forces chief. The move also drew criticism from many
within the new president's 14-party coalition.
   The president's remarks, at her first news conference since
taking office five days ago, were a clear attempt to ease tensions
within the coalition.
   The transition of power from the leftist Sandinistas to Mrs.
Chamorro's UNO coalition followed nine years of a U.S.-backed
insurgency by the Contras, in which 30,000 people died.
   The inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, a conservative elected in
February, brought immediate resumption of U.S. aid and trade
assistance.
   At her news conference, the president commented for the first
time on austerity measures aimed at patching up the battered
economy. Mrs. Chamorro said the Sandinistas had left only $3
million in the treasury and an $11 billion foreign debt.
   ``That is why it is urgent that we apply severe measures that
will allow us in the short term to stabilize the currency and
prices, to guarantee investment and the productive effort now that
this year's agricultural cycle is starting,'' she said.
   Last week the cordoba, Nicaragua's currency, was devalued by
half, sharply increasing prices and causing more hardship in an
already poor country.
   At the news conference, Mrs. Chamorro said the powerful secret
police force, which was run by the Sandinista Interior Ministry,
would be abolished. But she did not elaborate.
   She also said a requirement that both Nicaraguans and foreigners
obtain exit visas to leave the country would be ended.
   Mrs. Chamorro also referred to differences with her vice
president, Virgilio Godoy, who is out of the country on an
unexplained trip. He is engaged in bitter rivalry for influence and
power with some of Mrs. Chamorro's close advisers.
   ``I trust that the vice president ... will accompany and support
me with the total loyalty in the taking of the great decisions and
in the fulfillment of the complex tasks with which the people of
Nicaragua have entrusted us,'' she said.
   Mrs. Chamorro faces two May Day protest marches, one by a
Sandinista labor union demanding 100 percent pay raises and the
demobilization of Contras, and another by a bloc of four
independent trade unions demanding Gen. Ortega be removed.
   ``I understand that in the case of the army, the people and the
political sectors that helped me and support me would like a
drastic and immediate change,'' she said. ``But we need to do
things well, even if it means resuming temporary sacrifices to
guarantee the tranquility and stability of the country.''
   Contra military chief Israel Galeano is meeting with Mrs.
Chamorro on Wednesday to discuss the rebels' position. The rebels
had agreed to demobilize by June 10, but many have put off laying
down their arms.
   Galeano has said he wants the Sandinista People's Army
dismantled _ or, at the very least, the departure of Gen. Ortega
and the top Sandinista military officers.
   The president said she had met several times with Gen. Ortega
and had told him the job was temporary. He was being retained ``to
ensure the unity and discipline of the army'' while the Contras
disarm, she said.
   The Sandinistas say the army is protected by the Constitution
and any attempt to radically change it could result in violence.
While Mrs. Chamorro's United National Opposition coalition has a
majority in the National Assembly, it does not have enough votes
there to change the constitution.

<HEAD>Third Day of Prison Disturbances in France</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Nice, Douai disturbances. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protests broke out at French prisons Monday
for the third day in a row, and the authorities said steps would be
taken to reduce overcrowding and other problems.
   In the northern city of Douai, about 50 disgruntled inmates
scaled a jailhouse roof Monday and brandished a
skull-and-crossbones flag. Police fired tear gas, and the prisoners
returned to their cells. A similar rooftop protest had occurred at
the prison Sunday.
   In Nice, on the French Riviera, about 150 inmates protested
overcrowding at their prison by refusing to return to their cells
following an afternoon exercise period Monday. They ended the
two-hour protest after presenting a list of demands to authorities.
   The protests followed two days of rioting by 500 inmates at the
Loos-Les-Lille prison in this northern industrial city. Inmates
burned a workshop and garage, sacked 175 cells and hurled roof
tiles at police, causing an estimated $1.7 million in damage. No
serious injuries were reported.
   Prison investigators questioned inmates Monday to determine who
led the rioting. They promised to uphold negotiators' pledges that
no general reprisals would be carried out.
   Pierre Arpaillange, the country's top prison official, blamed
the riot on overcrowding at Loos-Les-Lilles, which was built for
550 prisoners but holds 1,000. The prison at Nice reportedly holds
900 inmates in a facility built for 280.
   Arpaillange told the RTL radio that new prisons for 13,000
inmates are to open by July.
   The rebellions were the first in French prisons this year, but
there were at least 10 such revolts in 1989. A series of prison
revolts in 1987 during an intense heat spell started at the
Loos-Les-Lille and Douai facilities.
   Loos-Les-Lille is about 125 miles north of Paris and 25 miles
from Douai.
   Officials said there is no overcrowding at Douai, where 540
inmates are housed in a facility with a capacity for 575.
   The demands of the Loos-Les-Lille inmates were never made clear,
but officials said they centered on the slowness of the justice
system and the parliamentary amnesty recently granted to a number
of politicians in a fund-raising scandal.
   The Douai prisoners were demanding better recreational
facilities.

<TEXT>
   A former guerrilla, left with one leg
and slurred speech after an assassination attempt six years ago,
gained the support of a leftist coalition Monday as replacement for
a slain presidential candidate.
   Former field commander Antonio Navarro replaces Carlos Pizarro,
his onetime guerrilla boss, on the May 27 ballot. Pizarro was
assassinated last Thursday.
   The government is printing 16 million new ballots to replace
those carrying Pizarro's name and photograph. Photos help
illiterates identify candidates.
   The Democratic Alliance, a coalition of many of Colombia's
leftists that claims to have the support of the nation's labor
unions, will support Navarro. He is the new leader of the M-19
movement. Last month M-19 disbanded as a guerrilla organization and
became a political party.
   Colombia's Communist Party refused to support Pizarro and does
not support Navarro. The party is divided as a result of Communist
loss of prestige and power througout the world.
   The secret police meanwhile said they could not verify the
authenticity of a letter purported to be from Pablo Escobar, chief
of the Medellin drug cartel, claiming that Escobar did not murder
Pizarro, as suggested by national police.
   The letter said Escobar sheltered M-19 guerrillas in the past.
   The movement took its name from the date of the April 19, 1970
presidential elections that rebels said were rigged.
   Former president Misael Pastrana of the opposition Conservative
Party urged President Virgilio Barco on Monday to resign before his
four-year term ends Aug. 7. His remarks came in an interview
published by the Bogota daily La Prensa and in a live broadcast
interview with the radio chain RCN.
   Citing Pizarro's assassination, the third of a presidential
candidate since last August, Pastrana said Barco ``has lost all
authority.''
   He said violence had overwhelmed state security forces and that
Colombia could not afford to be led by a lame duck president for
too long.
   Pastrana, president from 1974 to 1978, confirmed the pilot of an
Avianca jet asked him to to leave the plane on Saturday because
passengers were afraid to travel with a political leader, a
potential target for assassins.
   Pastrana said he was out campaigning for Conservative
presidential candidate Rodrigo Lloreda, but agreed to get off the
jetliner with his bodyguards because he understood passengers'
fears.
   On Friday, 100 passengers refused to board an Avianca plane in
Barranquilla when it was learned that a leftist congressmen was
going to be aboard with 25 bodyguards.
   Pizarro's shooting occurred on an Avianca airliner in flight.

   Slain Iranian opposition leader Kazem
Rajavi was buried in Iraq on Monday, and comrades who blamed Iran
for his assassination called for revenge.
   ``Kazem's blood will not rest until the regime of the mullahs
(clerics) is overthrown,'' Massoud Rajavi, Kazem's brother and
leader of the Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group chanted in unison
with scores of mourners.
   Kazem, 56, was killed by a burst of machine gun fire last week
near his home in a suburb of Geneva, Switzerland.
   Police have made no arrests in connection with the slaying, but
evidence has suggested a link with the Teheran government.
   Iranian officials have denied any connection with the murder.
   Kazem Rajavi was the chief lobbyist for the Baghdad-based
Mujahedeen with the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and the
numerous Geneva-based international organisations.
   His body was flown from Geneva to Baghdad on Sunday and brought
to this holy city for burial the following day. Kazem's French-born
wife, Michelle, and his two sons, Kayhan and Kamal, accompanied the
body.
   Moslem Shiites, who form the vast majority of Iran's population,
consider Karbala their holiest shrine after Mecca because the
founder of their sect, Hussein is buried there. Hussein was one of
the grandsons of Islam's Prophet Mohammed.
   Shiites believe anyone buried in Karbala is guaranteed a place
in heaven.
   Speaking in French with tears in her eyes, Kazem's wife,
Michelle, told mourners that her husband's mission ``is now
completed and he has crossed the river of freedom for the sake of
your country.''
   She said Kazem must be happy that he was buried in Karbala,
which she described as ``the land of revolution and paradise.''
   The Mujadeen Khalq are the largest Iranian resistance group.
   The Mujahedeen were first allied with Iranian spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the struggle to topple the late
Shah. But in 1980-81, a year after Khomeini took power, he turned
on the group and other leftist factions, killing and imprisoning
tens of thousands of people.
   The Mujahedeen and their military wing, the National Liberation
Army, receive training and support from Iraq.
   The group is estimated to have 20,000 fighters.

<TEXT>
   Blues legend B.B. King left a Las Vegas
hospital Monday in good spirits and ``asking for his guitar'' after
being hospitalized over the weekend because of a bout with high
blood sugar.
   King, who had to cancel performances at the New Orleans Jazz and
Heritage Festival over the weekend, returned to his Las Vegas home
for two weeks of recuperation, his manager said.
   Manager Sid Seidenberg said King, 64, was admitted Friday to
Valley Hospital, where doctors were concerned about King's blood
sugar level and suggested the hospitalization for further tests. He
said the level is being monitered.
   Seidenberg said King had a ``diabetic attack,'' but his
assistant, Tina Brincat, said he wasn't diagnosed as having
diabetes. Hosptial officials refused to discuss the case.
   Diabetes is a condition in which the body is unable to properly
process the sugar it needs to function. It results in high blood
sugar.
   Seidenberg, speaking from his office in New York, said the
bluesman was on the way to the airport Friday when he began to feel
faint and dizzy.
   ``Something like this can happen to anybody,'' Seidenberg said.
``It's not anticipated it will hurt his career.
   ``He said he felt great on Saturday and by Sunday he was asking
for his guitar,'' Seidenberg said.
   He said King would appear as scheduled May 13 to receive an
honorary doctor's degree at Rhodes College in Memphis, where he
began his career in the late 1940s.
   He also said King would return to his tour schedule May 18, and
begin a monthlong European of 13 countries on June 21. King tours
270 days out of the year.
   King burst upon the music scene in 1948. His hits include ``You
Don't Know Me'' in 1952 and ``The Thrill is Gone'' in 1970.
   He has won four Grammy awards.

<HEAD>GOP Backs Away from Bush 1991 Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republicans backed away from President
Bush's 1991 budget on Monday, deciding to not force a House vote on
what they now say is an outdated $1.2 trillion spending plan.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee, said he changed his mind about offering Bush's package
after talking with GOP leaders.
   Republicans had planned to force the House to vote on the
president's proposal during debate scheduled for Tuesday on a
Democratic alternative, as they frequently have done in past years.
   The reversal seems to indicate that many Republicans would
prefer to not have to vote for Bush's plan.
   ``There's a feeling among Republicans that the budget has been
passed by by economic and political events,'' said Frenzel, R-Minn.
``To debate it is a waste of time. We have to do a real job based
on the realities of the day.''
   Since Bush offered his budget in January, the Warsaw Pact has
deteriorated even further and the U.S. economy has seemed to
hesitate.
   Bush's $303.7 billion defense proposal has been criticized by
Democrats _ and some Republicans _ as unneccessarily high. The
Democrats want to spend $295.4 billion.
   And even Bush's plan understates the amount of deficit reduction
that will be needed to satisfy the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget
law. To meet that law's target of a maximum $64 billion shortfall
next year, Darman has said that at least $45 billion in savings
will be needed, rather than the $37 billion Bush has proposed.
   The Democratic plan also proposes $37 billion in spending cuts
and new revenues.
   Republicans had always expected that the president's proposal
would be a loser in the House, where Democrats prevail 258-176.
   But they had until now planned to offer it anyway. They saw it
as a rallying point and as a GOP bargaining position in what they
hope will be negotiations between the White House and congressional
leaders.
   ``It is embarrassing,'' said Frenzel of the change of plans.
   But he added, ``I didn't want to go ahead against large numbers
of people in our caucus,'' referring to House Republicans.
   White House spokesman Stephen Hart said he would not comment on
the House GOP decision.
   Senate Republicans decided weeks ago to not offer Bush's plan as
that chamber's budget panel tries to work out a 1991 spending
package.

<HEAD>Connecticut Enacts Abortion Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Connecticut on Monday became the first
state to give women the legal right to abortion in a law intended
to stand even if the Supreme Court reverses its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.
   The Roe vs. Wade decision said states cannot ban abortions, but
if the ruling were struck down, states would then be able to make
abortion illegal.
   Without ceremony, Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Roman
Catholic who personally opposes abortion, signed the bill into law
Monday afternoon. It takes effect Oct. 1.
   The bill cleared the state Senate on Friday, 32-3, and the House
the week before, 136-12. It repeals the state's unenforced criminal
anti-abortion statutes, requires women under 16 to be counseled
before getting an abortion and encourages them to tell their
parents.
   In a variation on the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade ruling, the
new law allows abortions late in pregnancy, when the fetus is
capable of living outside the womb, only when the life or health of
the mother is in danger.
   ``I believe this measure strikes a balance between a person's
right to privacy and state interests,'' the governor said in a news
release.
   ``It recognizes a right to choice by women. The law also
recognizes the state has an interest in fetus viability and
properly recognizes that minors should be counseled before making
the very difficult decision to abort a pregnancy,'' O'Neill said.
   When the bill passed the House, Betty Gallo, a lobbyist for the
Connecticut Coalition for Choice, called it ``the most aggressive,
pro-choice piece of legislation since Webster.'' She referred to
the Supreme Court's decision last summer in Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services, that gave states greater power to
restrict abortions.
   Connecticut's anti-abortion laws were rendered unenforceable by
Roe vs. Wade. They carried penalties of up to five years in prison
and a $1,000 fine for anyone performing an abortion, and two years
in prison and a $500 fine for women getting abortions, except to
protect the life of the mother.
   State Rep. Nancy Wyman, one of several Democrats who crafted the
bill, said O'Neill, with his personal opposition to abortion, made
a difficult decision.
   ``I know that it's not truly with his conscience,'' said Wyman.
``He's doing something that is good for the women of Connecticut.''
   Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights League said she
could ``count on one hand'' the number of other states where
similar legislation could pass.
   ``You have to have a pro-choice legislature and you have to have
a governor who is pro-choice, who understands that women, not
politicians, should make this decision,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Washington.
   ``Today Gov. O'Neill has shown his utmost respect for the women
of his state. He's shown that he trusts the women of his state to
make their own personal and private decisions about abortion.''
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a similar bill earlier this
year, describing it as too liberal.
   Meanwhile, the state's leading anti-abortion group, the Pro-Life
Council of Connecticut, continued to describe the bill as a success
because of its provisions on counseling and fetus viability.
   At a news conference, the group announced the formation of a
team of pro-life lawyers that will work to ensure portions of the
law are enforced, particularly the counseling of minor girls on
options other than abortion.
   ``This whole thing for us has been a major breakthrough, because
before, we had nothing,'' said Regina Smith, the executive director
of the council.
   More strident anti-abortion activists were more critical of the
bill.
   ``Pro-life not only didn't get anything, we are in a far worse
position than we were before,'' said state Rep. Anthony Nania, a
conservative who voted against the bill and has called for Smith's
ouster.
   ``To say that there are new restrictions on abortion flies in
the face of the facts.''
   When the bill passed the House, Betty Gallo, a lobbyist for the
Connecticut Coalition for Choice, called it ``the most aggressive,
pro-choice piece of legislation since Webster.''

   Gov. Bill Clements said Monday he would
veto a bill that would increase the state sales tax by half a cent
and pay for a court-ordered school finance reform plan.
   That set off picketing by teachers at the governor's mansion.
   ``I think teachers are very angry and very upset and very
frustrated,'' said John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of
Teachers, whose group organized the march that drew about 300.
   The reform bill has loomed over the state's education system
since the state Supreme Court ruled last year that financing of the
$13.5 billion school system must change. The state comptroller
threatened Monday to freeze state education spending at midnight.
   The Legislature is expected to send Clements the bill on
Tuesday, the deadline set by the high court ruling. The measure
would put a $555 million finance plan into effect.
   But Clements, who is retiring, is against increasing taxes and
wants to re-allocate funds to pay for a less-expensive reform plan.
A combination of state and federal aid and local property taxes now
pay for state education.
   ``I am going to veto the bill just like I said I would,''
Clements said in Dallas. He said he would summon legislators
Wednesday into a third special session on education to find a
solution.
   The Republican governor was out of town when teachers gathered
at his residence to protest the failure by him and the
Democratic-controlled Legislature to reach agreement on how to pay
for the reform.
   Clyde Hemminger, a sixth-grade social studies teacher from Fort
Worth, shook the locked iron gates and said of Clements: ``He's
obviously locked the doors to the mansion; we'd like to keep the
doors to the schoolhouse open.''
   Many of the signs brandished by the protesting teachers attacked
Clements' veto promise.
   ``Hey Bill! Exercise your mind, not your pen,'' said one sign, a
reference to the governor's remark earlier in the day that by
marching the teachers ``will get a lot of good exercise.''
   On Oct. 2, the court ruled the state's finance system was unfair
to property-poor school districts and ordered the Legislature to
overhaul the system.
   State officials will appear Tuesday before state District Judge
Scott McCown, who is overseeing the case, to explain why no reforms
were approved before the deadline.
   The expected veto has raised the ire of teachers, Cole said.
   ``They have been observing officials of the state of Texas
treating education _ something that teachers feel very fervently
about _ as though it were a political game and using the students
and the school employees as pawns in that game. ...
   ``If students acted like this, we would be giving them Fs and
sending notes home to their parents,'' he said.
   The high court has threatened to stop state aid if a reform plan
does not go into effect by Tuesday. Comptroller Bob Bullock said he
would freeze state education expenses, including nearly $2.7
million in salaries for more than 1,000 Texas Education Agency
employees, unless the judge intercedes.
   ``At the stroke of midnight ... state funding for public
education stops unless the governor has signed the bills passed by
the Legislature,'' he said.
   But Clements, citing $400 million sent to schools last Wednesday
in April state aid payments, said there was enough money to pay
teachers.
   ``We don't really have a problem,'' Clements said. ``We have
ample funds, and the funds are in hand to pay the teachers until, I
believe, it's the last two days of the school year.''
   The Texas Federation of Teachers and the Texas Classroom
Teachers Association said they want McCown to allow the state to
send school districts enough money to pay teachers. Failing that,
they want teachers to be released from employment contracts in
districts lacking enough local money to pay them.
   ``It wouldn't be a strike ... It would be like a lockout. We are
not advocating a walkout at this point,'' Cole said.
   ``Strikes, walkouts, all those things damage children. They
don't damage governors and legislators,'' said Jeri Stone,
executive director of the union.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen Moslem extremists were killed and
six injured Monday in clashes with police in a province that has
been the scene of frequent unrest involving Islamic
fundamentalists, security sources said.
   The sources said the clashes occurred at Kahk village in the
southern province of Fayoum, 60 miles southwest of Cairo.
   The trouble apparently began when militants tried to block the
arrests of three brothers suspected of killing their father. The
security sources said the 60-year-old father, Aly Dakheil, was
killed Sunday during an argument in which he was trying to persuade

   Monday's casualties bring to 15 the number of Moslem
fundamentalists shot dead in the area by police in the last week.
   Two were killed last week in a shootout with police, who were
combing the area for suspects in a bomb attack on a Christian
Coptic church in the village of Sanhour. That attack resulted in
the death of a policeman and the injury of two other guards, and
was the latest ina series of attacks on Coptic property.
   Fayoum is the home of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, a blind preacher
widely acknowledged as leader of the Moslem group Al-Gamaa
Al-Islamiya. The group demands immediate implementation of Sharia,
the 1,400-year-old Islamic rfeligious and ethical code.
   The militants have been active in recent weeks through a wide
area of south Egypt in the provinces of Faryoum, Assiut and
el-Minya. The unrest has included riots, clashes with police and
arson attacks.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Reverses Himself; Las Vegas Data to be Confidential</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has reversed
himself and will keep confidential financial data of a newspaper
seeking approval of joint operations with a competitor in Nevada, a
spokesman said Monday night.
   The attorney general signed an order reversing his decision of
Feb. 16 requiring the Las Vegas Review-Journal to disclose
circulation and advertising revenue, said spokesman David Runkel.
   The publisher of the newspaper, Donrey of Nevada Inc., an arm of
closely held Donrey Media Group, had sought reconsideration of the
February decision in a March 2 petition.
   Donrey argued that disclosure would damage relations with
customers, suppliers and unions not only in Las Vegas but in the 73
other markets in 21 states in which Donrey operates.
   In a June agreement, the Review-Journal and the Las Vegas Sun
said they planned to merge their business, circulation and
production operations, keeping separate editorial departments,
along the lines of joint operating agreements in force in 19 other
cities.
   Such agreements are permitted if the attorney general finds that
one newspaper is in danger of failing. In Las Vegas, both
newspapers have said the Sun is in ``probable danger of financial
failure.''
   The data in question already have been submitted to the Justice
Department.

<HEAD>Turkish Experts Clear Tubes as No Part of Giant Iraqi Gun</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Arms experts in this province near the
Bulgarian border determined Monday that steel tubes seized by
customs officials were not part of a giant Iraqi weapon launcher,
Turkish news agencies reported.
   Hurriyet news agency quoted Gov. Unal Erkan as saying three
trucks carrying the tubes were allowed Monday to go to Iraq after
being examined. Hurriyet quoted Erkan as saying experts from Trakya
University in Edirne and Istanbul Tehcnical University concluded
the cargo consisted of normal pipes.
   Three trailer trucks _ two Bulgarian and one Yugoslav _ were
seized at Kapikule border gate last week.
   A fourth truck _ Hungarian _ carrying a steel tube 39 feet long
was seized at Haydarpasa customs station in Istanbul after arriving
aboard a ship from Romania on April 19, a customs official there
confirmed.
   Turkish newspapers quoted authorities as saying that particular
cargo resembled pipes seized in Britain on April 12.
   Anatolia news agency quoted Prime Minister Yildirim Akbulut as
saying the steel tubes issue may come up during his official visit
to Bagdad this week
   Customs officials in Britain seized eight steel tubes en route
to Iraq. Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said Britain was convinced
the tubes were part of a giant gun. Weapons experts say such a gun
might be able to fire nuclear or chemical weapons long distances or
boost rockets into orbit.
   Iraq says the tubes were meant for a petrochemical plant.

   Peasants in an Andean mountain village stoned
to death a local leader of a Shining Path guerrilla group along
with his mother and sister, police said Monday.
   Police said almost 200 peasants attacked Similiano Chavez Yanac
and his sister, Vitaliana, as they were visiting their 65-year-old
mother, Alberta, in the town of Huamarin, 180 miles north of Lima.
   Chavez, 43, and his 35-year-old sister were members of the
Maoist-inspired Shinning Path group and were armed with automatic
weapons, police said.
   The mob beat the three with sticks and then stoned them to
death, police said.
   They said Chavez has led a local guerrilla force for a number of
years.
   He was wanted by police on suspicion of killing a number of
peasants.
   Officials say more than 18,000 people have been killed since the
Shining Path began its armed insurgency 10 years ago.

   A Poseidon C-3 ballistic missile was
successfully launched from a nuclear submarine Monday as part of
the vessel's final testing program before deployment, an Air Force
spokeswoman said.
   The USS Kamehameha launched the two-stage missile at 1:50 a.m.
EDT off the coast near Cape Canaveral, said Sgt. Ivy Paige of
Patrick Air Force Base.
   The launch was part of an exercise to assess the submarine's
readiness for deployment and efficiency with the weapons system.
The Poseidon is designed to carry nuclear warheads to targets on
land.
   It was the 86th successful launch of a C-3 from Cape Canaveral
since August 1968 and the 65th firing from a submarine.
   No date has been set for the deployment of the submarine, based
in Charleston, S.C.

<HEAD>Trial Begins for Alleged Bomb Factory Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men whom the authorities say are members of
the Irish Republican Army went on trial Monday in connection with
the operation of a bomb factory that London police stumbled upon by
accident.
   Authorities said they headed off a Christmastime bombing
campaign with the arrest of the two men _ Nicholas Mullen, 42, and
Eamon Wadley, 36 _ and the discovery of the arms and explosives
cache in December 1988.
   At the Old Bailey Central Criminal Court, Mullen denied charges
of conspiring to cause explosions and Wadley denied charges of
making documents for use in terrorism. The trial is expected to
last up to six weeks.
   Police accidentally discovered the stockpile in an apartment
complex after a shooting nearby. They pursued a gunman into the
complex and, while searching the area, found an apartment filled
with Semtex plastic explosive, machine guns, firearms, rifles,
handguns, and bomb-making equipment.
   Prosecutor John Nutting described it as one of the biggest
stockpiles of terrorist equipment ever found in Britain.
   He said the two accused were members of an IRA unit that was
about to embark on a pre-Christmas bombing campaign that he said
``certainly would have led to the death or injury of many people.''
   The IRA is waging a bloody fight to drive the British out of the
predominantly Protestant province of Northern Ireland and unite it
with the Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   In Belfast, Shauneen Baker, 17, appeared in court on charges of
possessing a Semtex bomb with intention to endanger life and damage
property.
   She was arrested Saturday by security forces who stopped and
searched a bus taking people to Aldergrove International Airport,
15 miles from Belfast.

<HEAD>Former Houston Police Officer Receives Seven-Year Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Houston police officer was sentenced
Monday to seven years in prison for killing a black woman in a
shootout on a Houston freeway after a night of drinking among
off-duty officers.
   Alex Gonzales, 25, was convicted Friday of voluntary
manslaughter in the case, which became a cause for groups that
maintain Houston police are hostile to blacks.
   Blacks and other community leaders said they did not think an
all-white jury would convict the Gonzales.
   Trial in the death of Ida Lee Delaney, a janitor at The Houston
Post, was moved to Dallas because of heavy news coverage in Houston.
   Attorneys for Gonzales planned an appeal.
   A community activist who has monitored the case said she
believed most observers would consider the verdict fair.
   ``Obviously, there was enough information and evidence to bring
some form of justice and that was critical in my opinion,'' said
activist Charlotte Ragsdale. ``The family was looking for hope in
the system in they were able to find it.''
   Tests after the shooting showed Gonzales had a blood-alcohol
level of .19, nearly twice the amount to be considered legally
drunk in Texas.
   Gonzales testified that Ms. Delaney shot at him and two other
off-duty officers before they chased her on a Houston freeway for
12 miles early on Oct. 31, 1989.
   During the pre-dawn chase, the 50-year-old woman pulled her
truck over to the side of the road, apparently seeking help. Ms.
Delaney fired at Gonzales after he ran to her truck, gun in hand,
and punched her in the face, witnesses testified. Though wounded,
he returned fire, killing her.
   The jury spent most of the day Monday determining the sentence.
Gonzales could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.
   Gonzales and the two other officers, Alexander Romero and Robert
Gonzales, who is unrelated, were fired by former Houston Police
Chief Lee Brown. All three have appealed their firings.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
said Monday that Japan intends to play an increasing role in Asia
through its economic and technological power.
   Kaifu, who arrived in India on Sunday to start a weeklong tour
of five South Asian nations, said Japan had ``learned the lessons
of history'' after its defeat in World War II and would never again
aspire to power through military means.
   ``But times have changed dramatically,'' Kaifu said in an
address to the Indian Parliament.
   ``Now that the building of a new world through dialogue and
cooperation is being called for, Japan can and must play a positive
role by putting to effective use its economic and technological
capabilities,'' he told the Indian Parliament.
   Following Kaifu's 40-minute address, Prime Minister V.P. Singh
said: ``We i India see a growing role of Japan in Asia. Japan
resents more than a triumph of technology, financial intrepidity of
managerial excellence.''
   ``The time has come, I am convinced, for this Japanese
initiative to bear its effectiveness even further,'' Singh said.
   Japan has promised $50 billion for its five-year worldwide aid
program that started in 1988. The bulk of that money is contributed
to Asian nations.
   Earlier in the day, Kaifu met Singh and said Japan would extend
a loan of about $633 million to India next year, Kaifu's spokesman
said.
   The exact amount of the Japanese loan will be decided at the
June meeting of the Aid India Consortium, the spokesman, Shigeo
Takenaka, told reporters.
   Kaifu heads to Bangladesh on Wednesday and then to Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and Indonesia.

<HEAD>Bush Tells Panamanian President US `Will Stand With You'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf pvs, But saying, with 3 grafs to UPDATE with
late Senate action.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced his nomination of the
first-ever Panamanian to manage the Panama Canal as he told that
nation's new president on Monday that the United States ``will
stand with you in peace.''
   Bush, in his first meeting with President Guillermo Endara since
the U.S. invasion of Panama last December, also voiced support for
Endara's proposal to speed up a study on the feasibility of
widening the 86-year-old waterway.
   But saying ``the struggle is not over in Panama,'' Bush
chastised Congress for not moving quicker on his $800 million aid
package for Panama and Nicaragua. The measure has been delayed in
the Senate behind a long list of unrelated amendments.
   One snag, a dispute over abortion and the death penalty in the
District of Columbia, was cleared away late Monday when senators
agreed on a voice vote to include both provisions in the bill and
work out the issues in a House-Senate conference committee later.
The accepted language would allow use of D.C. funds to pay for
abortions for poor women and permit the death penalty for
drug-related murders in the district.
   But if the abortion provision remains in the bill, Bush has said
he would veto it, which would lead to further delay.
   ``I've asked and asked again that our aid package to the newly
liberated people of Panama be passed and passed swiftly. And still
it waits, and with it the future of the fledgling democracy,'' said
Bush, Endara at his side, after the two leaders met for 2{ hours.
   Endara was installed as president last Dec. 20 by U.S. invasion
forces who toppled the government of strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Endara, speaking in Spanish, said his people had suffered
``under 21 long years'' but that ``tyrannies of any kind, of any
sort, must be relegated to the past.''
   Then, addressing Bush directly in English, Endara thanked him
for filling ``our spirits with enthusiasm and optimism.'' He
invited Bush to visit Panama as soon as possible.
   ``Be careful, I might just show up,'' Bush said.
   In a departure ceremony, Bush praised Endara as ``a consensus
builder'' who ``won the confidence of Panamanians and all
Americans.''
   The president used the occasion to announce he was sending to
the Senate, under terms of the 1978 Panama Canal Treaties, the
nomination of Gilberto Guardia Fabrega to be Panama Canal
Commission administrator.
   The treaties called for a Panamanian _ selected by Panama,
nominated by the U.S. president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate _
to be put in charge of the canal in the final decade of U.S.
jurisdiction.
   The canal will be turned over to Panama in the year 2000.
   Last year, Bush balked at a Noriega choice for canal
administrator and refused to send a name to the Senate. The present
administrator, Dennis P. McAuliffe, is an American.
   Guardia, 60, is the president of an architectural and
engineering company in Panama City. Educated at Santa Clara
University in California, Guardia was a civil engineer with the
Panama Canal Company in the 1950s.
   Endara praised Bush's endorsement of Guardia as canal
administrator as ``an act of justice.''
   Bush and Endara also signed four agreements: three on drug-war
cooperation and the other to allow Peace Corps volunteers back into
the isthmus nation.
   ``Panama, a nation newly reborn in liberty, can count on the
support of the United States of America. We were with you in times
of conflict, and we will stand with you in peace,'' Bush said.
   Both in his comments with Endara, and in remarks earlier Monday
to the annual convention of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Bush
accused Congress of dragging its feet on his Central American aid
package.
   Bush complained that his package of aid to Panama and Nicaragua
had become weighed down _ by adding another $800 million in
unrelated spending in the House and with ``a contentious abortion
provision'' in the Senate.
   Bush asked Congress last March 13 for the $800 million package _
$500 million for Panama and $300 for Nicaragua. The Senate trimmed
the Panama part of the package to $420 million.
   ``It is embarrassing'' that the aid still hasn't won passage,
Bush told the Chamber of Commerce audience. ``Nicaragua and Panama
quite simply need this aid and we've got to deliver.''
   ``No wonder the American people get so frustrated with the way
the Congress operates,'' he added.
   Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson told a news
conference that Bush endorsed Endara's proposal that a
U.S.-Panama-Japan study on widening the Panama Canal _ halted under
Noriega's regime _ go forward and produce its recommendations
within five years.
   Of the three new drug agreements: one would allow the U.S.
military to board Panamanian-flag vessels suspected of carrying
narcotics; another seeks to regulate chemical substances used for
illicit drugs; and the third would permit the U.S. Coast Guard to
enter Panamanian territorial waters under specified circumstances.

<HEAD>China Lifts Martial Law in Tibet</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with martial law ending. Picks

<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities lifted martial law on Tuesday
in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, nearly 14 months after the
restrictions were imposed to quell bloody nationalist rioting.
China said social order had been restored.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said martial law, imposed March
8, 1989 after three days of anti-Chinese rioting, officially ended
on orders of Premier Li Peng.
   ``In view of the fact that the situation in ... Lhasa has become
stable and social order has returned to normal, the task of
enforcing martial law in the city has been successfully
fulfilled,'' said a Cabinet order signed by Li.
   Xinhua said People's Liberation Army troops were ordered to
leave their posts around the Jokhang Temple, Buddhist Tibet's
holiest shrine and a flashpoint for anti-government demonstrations,
at midnight Monday.
   Troops have manned checkpoints on main roads leading into the
temple and maintained sentries around the Barkhor Square that
encompasses the temple.
   It is likely that the army and the paramilitary People's Armed
Police will continue to be deployed in large numbers around the
city.
   Anti-Chinese, pro-independence sentiments remain high in Lhasa.
Xinhua warned Monday that ``separatists on both sides of the border
... are still plotting to continue their separatist and destructive
activities. We absolutely cannot relax our vigilance.''
   The government said 16 people were killed and more than 100
wounded in last year's riots. Tibetan and foreign sources said
about 30 died.
   Altogether, Tibetans say about 70 people have died in clashes
with police and soldiers in the past three years.
   The rioting was the bloodiest in Tibet since a failed 1959
uprising and marked the first time martial law was announced in
China since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when radical leftists
tried to purge China of bourgeois influence.
   The riots began March 5 when Tibetans carrying banners marched
around Jokhang Temple. Chinese police opened fire.
   Angry crowds began stoning police and went on a three-day
rampage, burning Chinese shops and attacking Chinese passers-by.
Police responded with more gunfire and tear gas.
   Tibetans spoke of hundreds of arrests after the March riots, but
China's official media reported only 20 people being sentenced,
some receiving life prison terms and others a few years.
   During martial law, the military presence in Lhasa _ normally
high _ was stepped up further, with soldiers or paramilitary
officers stationed at intersections. Most reporters were barred
from the city. Tourism was tightly restricted.
   Nonetheless, reports of several small nationalist protests have
filtered out, to be routinely denied by the Chinese.
   Most recently, a monitoring group in London, the Tibet
Information Network, said Chinese authorities expelled several
Buddhist monks and nuns from religious institutions and hundreds of
monks left their monasteries in protest.
   Most monks and nuns remain loyal to the Dalai Lama, their exiled
religious leader and once Tibet's secular ruler. They have been at
the forefront of most independence demonstrations in recent years
and were forced to undergo political education during martial law.
   China has said the Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace
Prize for his peaceful resistance to Chinese rule, can return only
if he gives up his proposal for Tibetan autonomy. He fled to India
in 1959.
   China says its sovereignty over Tibet dates back to the 13th
century, when a Chinese princess married a Tibetan ruler.
   However, many Tibetans say Chinese rule was sporadic and that
for many years Tibetans had their own theocratic government, flag
and currency. Tibetans speak a different language, and they are
culturally distinct from Chinese.

   A radar-equipped helium balloon designed to
spot drug smugglers was torn apart by high wind and its
sophisticated equipment was damaged, officials said.
   The $12 million balloon, one of 16 intended to be deployed along
the Mexican border by the U.S. Customs Service, tore into three
pieces during 57 mph winds Saturday afternoon said Customs
spokeswoman Kathy Hamor.
   The balloon was moored near the ground when the wind struck. The
craft, one of three to deployed from a West Texas base, has been
grounded since a sister craft was damaged by lightning in Decmeber.
   The balloon's radar was damaged, but a complete assessment
hadn't been made, said Danny Morris, an engineer with General
Electric Co., which made the balloon. GE still owns the balloon and
is paying the operating costs during a test period.
   The balloons are intended to float at 10,000 to 15,000 feet, and
information from their radar is transmitted to the ground along a
tether.
   The government plans a defensive line of 16 of the balloons, or
aerostats, from the Pacific Coast to the Grand Bahamas. Presently
five are in operation in Deming, N.M., Yuma and Fort Huachuca,
Ariz., Grand Bahama Island and Cudjoe Key, Fla.

   A 58-year-old college festival
wrecked by a weekend of rowdy rock throwing was abolished Monday.
   California Polytechnic State University President Warren Baker
called off future celebrations of the annual Poly Royal festival
for an indefinite period after a morning meeting with Mayor Ron
Dunin.
   On Friday and Saturday nights, party-goers hurled rocks and
bottles at police officers, who used tear gas and fire hoses to
disperse crowds. Sixty-four people were injured, including 14
police officers, and there were 110 arrests.
   The Poly Royal festival originally showcased student
achievements, but crowds had become increasingly lawless over the
past few years as parties and entertainment were added to the
activities.
   The celebration drew 100,000 people to the campus next to this
city of 40,000 on California's central coast.

<HEAD>AP President Says Electronic Darkroom Testing on Schedule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An electronic darkroom system designed by The
Associated Press to replace its current network of photo receivers
is on schedule and meeting pre-production testing goals, AP
President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi told the annual
meeting of the news cooperative.
   Boccardi told publishers and editors representing the AP's 1,486
newspaper members on April 23 that full-scale installation of the
AP Leaf darkroom is to begin in September after summer
field-testing. An installation schedule is to be announced in June.
   Because installation of the darkroom will mean conversion to
satellite delivery, the schedule will be driven by where AP can
achieve the biggest savings in land-line costs to help pay for the
project, Boccardi said.
   He said a joint committee of member photo editors and production
executives would be announced within two weeks to advise the AP on
the rollout of the darkroom program. Bill Rinehart, the
just-retired ANPA vice president for technical matters, will serve
on the panel.
   Boccardi compared the new technology for electronic handling of
photos to the computer terminal revolution in handling words. He
said it will mark a major step forward for newspapers.
   ``We will train your staff, and AP's service reliability will
stand behind the AP Leaf darkroom. It is the right step at the
right time,'' Boccardi said.
   He noted that darkrooms from sources other than AP could be used
with the AP Leaf, which will fully conform to ANPA standards.
   Other technological advancements are imminent, Boccardi added.
   By July 1, the AP expects to complete the conversion of its
entire highspeed system to deliver copy to members at 9,000 words a
minute.
   A customized stocks service that allows members to localize
market table pages is in print in a dozen member newspapers, and
the installation schedule for SelectStocks will be accelerated
through the rest of the year.
   Boccardi also touched on the plight of Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent, who was taken hostage in Lebanon five
years ago last month.
   ``We continue to search for an end to his ordeal and pray that
recent optimistic comments will lead to his release,'' Boccardi
said.

<HEAD>Mexican President Protests Doctor's Arrest in Camarena Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
speaking at the annual luncheon of The Associated Press on April
23, denounced the alleged U.S. kidnapping of a Mexican doctor to
face charges in the slaying of a narcotics agent.
   Salinas pointed to Mexican arrests and convictions of 28
defendants in the 1985 slaying of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena
as proof that Mexico needs no help in apprehending the guilty.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, who was brought to El Paso, Texas,
on April 3 from Guadalajara, Mexico, is one of 18 people under
indictment in the Camarena murder.
   
   A federal judge in Los Angeles has demanded an explanation of
how Alvarez came to the United States. If the doctor was kidnapped,
Salinas said, the incident could undermine the international
drug-fighting effort.
   ``This runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem
much larger than the one we are trying to combat,'' Salinas said.
   
   The Mexican government has complained about the arrest of the
gynecologist, alleging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
offered money for the kidnapping and may have been in on the actual
plot.
   Alvarez is alleged to have been present when Camarena was
tortured and murdered at a Guadalajara house. Prosecutors allege
that the doctor gave Camarena drugs to revive him for additional
torturing before he was killed.

<HEAD>Readership, Technology, Recycling Topics at ANPA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advertising consultant told the American
Newspaper Publishers Association on April 24 that papers should
adopt a more local focus because issues such as the push for
independence in Lithuania won't sell ads.
   At the association's 104th annual convention, the nation's
newspaper publishers also discussed declining readership,
telecommunications developments affecting papers and recycling of
newsprint.
   ``The only specialized thing about a newspaper is its
locality,'' said Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of FCB-Leber Katz
partners and vice president of consumer affairs for the Chrysler
Corp.
   Frank A. Daniels Jr., president and publisher of The News &amp;
Observer of Raleigh, N.C., said, ``A newspaper traditionally has
been a smorgasbord. You have something in there for everybody.''
   But Ms. Cutler warned against newspapers trying to be ``all
things to all people'' and suggested specialization was more
appealing to advertisers.
   ``The more generalized, the more all things to all people, the
less we care about you,'' she said.
   The comments came during a panel discussion called ``Ozzie and
Harriet Are Gone _ Who Do You Think You're Writing For?''
   Virginia Dodge Fielder, vice president of research for
Knight-Ridder Inc., expressed industry frustration in trying to
pinpoint the cause of declining readership.
   ``I wish people hated us more,'' she said. ``I wish they
expressed more dissatisfaction because if they did we'd know how to
tackle it. ... What the public is saying is not `I hate you' but `I
don't need you. You're a great electric company, but I live in an
all-gas house.'''
   One publisher said the industry may be close to winning a
6-year-old fight with the Bell companies over who can transmit
electronic information in the future.
   Robert M. Johnson, publisher, president andchief executive
officer of Newsday Inc. of Melville, N.Y., reported that Congress
is likely to pass a bill soon setting a telecommunications public
policy.
   He said the Bell companies have set aside a $25 million ``war
chest'' to fight for the right to publish information on its
electronic circuits. He said Bell seeks to launch an ``electronic
Yellow Pages'' that would compete directly with newspaper
advertising.
   Such actions would violate a 1984 federal court decision that
set out the principle of diversity in dividing AT&amp;T into separate
companies, he said.
   Citing antitrust laws, U.S. District Judge Harold Greene held
that those who control telecommunication lines should not also
control the information that goes over those lines, Johnson said.
   Johnson said that in the past year a task force of the ANPA has
worked with Congress on legislation addressing the issue. A draft
bill was produced but has not yet been passed. An appeal of the
original federal order has sent that back to Greene for
reconsideration.
   The chairman of the ANPA's Newsprint Resource Task Force said
publishers should move quickly to recycle newsprint to keep the
government from imposing regulations.
   Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive officer of
the Hearst Corp., New York, said publishers have resolved to double
the amount of recycled newsprint used in the coming year, reaching
a total of 4.6 million tons.
   ``We believe efforts to control newsprint can mean efforts to
control the press,'' he said. ``The prospect of dealing with a
regulated newsprint industry calls up an array of terrifying
unknowns.''
   Bennack said that at least two states have already mandated that
newspapers use recycled newsprint, but he insisted such official
orders will be unnecessary if publishers act on the recycling issue
voluntarily.

<HEAD>St. Louis Sun Closes Abruptly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The St. Louis Sun folded April 25, ending a
seven-month struggle to become the country's first big-city
newspaper to make a profitable launch since World War II.
   ``It is clear that we could not achieve sufficient circulation
to make this enterprise viable and so, we have concluded that there
is no longer room in St. Louis'' for the Sun, said Ralph Ingersoll
II, editor in chief.
   With a circulation of about 100,000, the seven-day morning
tabloid never threatened the St. Louis Post-Dispatch's circulation
of 375,000 daily and 565,000 on Sunday. But it did manage to
generate a fair share of controversy.
   The Sun was accused of sensationalism for its coverage of a
politician involved in a sexual assault and of the five-year
anniversary of an accident in which a man was nearly sawed in two.
   The newspaper also was chided for running photos of revealing
women's swimsuits and lingerie. Some critics derided its flood of
promotions, fluorescent green billboards and contests.
   But the Sun was praised for its coverage of the effort to build
a new domed stadium downtown and of the troubles facing St. Louis'
major air carrier, Trans World Airlines.
   Ingersoll is chairman and chief executive of Ingersoll
Publications Co. and has an interest in four other newspaper
holding companies. He said his new tabloid needed to sell most of
its copies from vending boxes and newsracks.
   Instead, it ended up with home-delivery sales outnumbering
single-copy sales 2-to-1.
   That cost the paper, which spent more than $25 million to start
up, an unexpected $5 million. Home delivery costs are higher
because of the expenses of billing customers and hiring delivery
people.
   The sudden death did not surprise everyone.
   ``They read the handwriting on the wall. ... The weather was
good, the Cardinals were playing, the Blues were playing and people
still weren't buying the paper. You don't have to be a brain
surgeon to figure it out,'' said Kevin Horrigan, a columnist who
jumped ship from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to join the Sun.
   In Horrigan's old newsroom, Post-Dispatch Editor William Woo
said he was sorry about the demise of the Sun. ``The Sun undertook
a difficult mission and made a valiant effort, which fell short,''
Woo said.
   Ingersoll said he didn't know how much money overall he had lost
on the Sun. He said the decision to close had nothing to do with
debt problems at another of his newspaper companies.
   ``I emphasize the sole reason the St. Louis Sun did not succeed
was the inability to generate adequate single-copy sales,'' he said.
   On April 20, an offer by Ingersoll to buy back much of the $240
million of junk bonds issued by his Community Newspapers Inc.
failed to attract a single bondholder. If the company can't agree
with bondholders on a buyback, it could be forced to more than
double the interest rate on some of the bonds to more than 26
percent.
   The St. Louis Sun was owned by Ingersoll Newspapers Inc., which
also owns 77 other newspapers in seven states.
   When he launched the Sun in September, Ingersoll said he wanted
to prove that new newspapers, if properly designed and promoted,
could be introduced in the United States just as they had been in
other countries.
   He said he was planning to move to St. Louis and would
personally direct the paper's launch. He spent many late nights in
its high-tech newsroom learning about sophisticated equipment and
refining the paper's look.
   ``I'm disappointed. I feel that we gave it our very best shot,''
he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Industry in Recession, Gannett Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like the entire newspaper industry,
Gannett Co. Inc. is mired in a recession that began in the second
half of 1989, Chairman John J. Curley told shareholders April 26.
   Gannett, whose profits grew along with its increasing size for
22 consecutive years since it became a publicly traded company,
``managed to report an up quarter, but barely'' in its
first-quarter earnings report, Curley said.
   Curley's comments were made after the American Newspaper
Publishers Association meeting, at which news executives discussed
the general drop in advertising revenues and an accompanying
decline in readership.
   Gannett has suffered from the downturn in advertising that
started in the Northeast, spread to the South and has not yet
reached the West Coast, company officials said. They were cautious
about prospects for their papers, including USA Today.
   Still, they said they expect USA Today to turn profitable for
the first time in 1990. They also said USA Weekend is approaching
profitability and now carries more ads than its main competitor,
Parade magazine.
   But Curley cautioned, ``We won't really know about the retail
climate until we find out what happens in May and June.''
   He noted that Gannett's stock price rose along with the fortunes
of the company in the first half of 1989, then fell when the
newspaper business turned down in mid-1989.
   Trustees of the Gannett Foundation, whose sole asset is 10
percent of the company's stock, said April 25 they would put the
block up for sale because Internal Revenue Service rules forced
them to consider diversifying their holdings. The charitable trust
is headed by former Gannett Chairman Allen H. Neuharth.
   The foundation's 15,940,185 shares of stock were worth about
$566 million last week. The foundation said that at times the
shares have been worth as much as $900 million.
   Through a spokesman, Neuharth declined to comment on a
Washington Post story that said the proposed sale may indicate a
rift between Neuharth and executives who have run the company since
he left as chairman in March 1989.
   Curley gave up using limousines and the corporate suites
Neuharth had rented in New York and Washington, and the Post said
Neuharth was upset by comments of Gannett executives criticizing
his lifestyle while chairman as excessive and wasteful.
   Curley also declined to comment through his spokeswoman, Sheila
Gibbons, although she said of the Post story, ``I think that's
overreaching.''
   Much of the shareholders meeting was devoted to descriptions of
how Gannett is trying to develop new products as Americans find
less time to read and show less inclination to do so.
   Such strategies include buying the city magazine in Rockford,
Ill., where Gannett publishes the Register Star newspaper, ``to
increase our already strong information and ad picture,'' said Gary
L. Watson, president of Gannett's community newspaper division.
   He said Gannett might buy other such magazines.
   Watson and other Gannett officials also described how the
company had:
   _published a ``talking phone book'' in Florida with access to
news, weather, sports and other information at a toll-free number.
   _put out advertising guides to luxury real estate, also in
Florida.
   _started upscale lifestyle supplements to attract advertisers in
New Jersey and Florida.
   _published a guide with Pacific Northwest tourist information to
be distributed on ferries that sail from Washington state to Alaska.
   _run specials on its television stations built around special
sections in USA Today.

<HEAD>First-Quarter Profit Down 33 Percent at Times Mirror</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Corp. said April 25 its
first-quarter profit fell 33 percent, largely because of an
advertising slowdown that hit its Northeastern newspapers, consumer
magazines and broadcast TV operations.
   For the quarter ending April 1, Times Mirror's earnings fell to
$46 million, or 36 cents per share, down from $68.8 million, or 53
cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenues rose 3.3 percent to $875.2 million from $846.9 million.
   But Times Mirror said its slide in earnings was partly
attributable to higher promotional costs and higher circulation
that pushed up operating costs at the Los Angeles Times.
   ``Although our professional publishing and cable television
operations achieved solid earnings growth during the quarter, their
performance only partially offset the marked deterioration in our
newspaper publishing segment,'' said Robert F. Erburu, Times
Mirror's chairman and chief executive.
   Ad volume was slow at the Northeastern newspapers, with Newsday
and New York Newsday suffering from a depressed New York economy,
Times Mirror said. The 1990 first quarter also had one less Sunday
than the year-earlier period, which reduced revenues.
   Despite increased revenues at the Los Angeles Times, a surge in
circulation increased operating costs, contributing to a 38 percent
decline in operating profit from newspapers.
   Times Mirror said its companywide circulation, as reported to
the Audit Bureau of Circulations but not yet verified, rose 4.1
percent for the daily papers and 3.2 percent on Sunday over the
past six months.
   At the Los Angeles Times, daily circulation during the same
period rose by 8.1 percent to 1,210,077, with Sunday circulation up
5.7 percent to 1,504,540, the company said. Publisher and Chief
Executive Officer David Laventhol estimated half the increase was
from former readers of the now-closed Herald Examiner.
   New York Newsday grew by 11.6 percent to 217,514 daily
circulation during the six months, and The Hartford (Conn.) Courant
reported a 2.2 percent rise to 230,358, the company said.
   Although consumer magazines also were affected by the
advertising slowdown, the book, magazine and other publishing
segment still had a 13.6 percent increase in quarterly revenues and
21.7 percent growth in operating profit as a result of gains by the
legal publishing, flight information and training businesses.

<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Corp. and Knight-Ridder Inc. on
April 25 announced a merger of their national advertising sales
operations into a single company called Newspapers First.
   The new company will represent 37 newspapers, including large
independents not affiliated with Times Mirror or Knight-Ridder,

also based in New York City, serves 26 newspaper markets.
   The merger takes effect on June 4. Newspapers First will have
its headquarters in New York. Additional offices will be located in
Chicago, Detroit, Miami, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Minneapolis and Atlanta.
   The independent newspapers that will be represented include The

   Dave Lyons remembers the glory days in
Odessa, Texas, when the oil boom brought roustabouts and rig
workers to west Texas and the circulation of his newspaper, The
Odessa American, shot skyward.
   ``They were blue-collar workers. But they were sophisticated,''
he said. ``They were world traveled. Some of them had served
overseas in Saudi Arabia or Libya.''
   They were people who read newspapers.
   Now, many of the oil people are gone, and, like other Texas
papers, The Odessa American is struggling back from a precipitous
tumble in readership and advertising.
   Texas papers are not alone. Odessa's story was typical of tales
of woe told last week at the American Newspaper Publishers
Association's 104th convention, a gathering that annually takes the
pulse of the U.S. newspaper industry.
   This year, the pulse was slower than ever and the prognosis for
the patient's future was anybody's guess. Was the problem a
recurring depression or something more life-threatening? A
transfusion of advertising would help, all agreed. A healthier
readership was advised.
   The Odessa American, a member of the Freedom Newspapers group
with a circulation of 38,000, is bouncing back, Lyons said, due to
aggressive changes. Those include conversion from an afternoon to a
morning paper and a heavy focus on local sports to attract
notoriously indifferent younger readers.
   ``Since 1986, we've lost about 20 percent (of circulation),''
Lyons said. ``But that was because we lost population. Our home
county had a population of 144,000 before the oil bust. Now the
population is 116,000. ...
   ``These days, every time I see an obituary for a person over 50,
I think, oh, no, there goes another subscriber,'' Lyons said.
   Advertising, the lifeblood of newspapers, has been draining away
at an alarming rate all over the country. In the worst slump since
the 1970s, advertising was down 2.8 percent in 1989 from a year
earlier, according to Leading National Advertisers, a firm that
tracks newspaper ad revenue.
   In the first quarter of 1990, even the normally robust Times
Mirror Co. reported a 33 percent fall in net income. The drop was
blamed on a soft ad market, particularly for the company's East
Coast newspapers.
   Times Mirror's flagship paper, the Los Angeles Times, announced
a dramatic circulation climb of 9.5 percent to an all-time high of
1,225,189 daily, buoyed by readers from the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner, which folded in November. But the Times' advertising
revenue was down about 2 percent.
   Ironically, the financial news that fills newspaper business
pages has had a boomerang effect, striking the messengers in the
pocketbook. Acquisitions, mergers, store closures and a falling
real estate market mean decreased advertising.
   Classified pages, the newspaper's financial backbone, shrank as
ads for automobiles, real estate and help-wanted declined.
   ``The question is whether it's cyclical or not,'' said John J.
Curley, chairman of Gannett Co., which owns more dailies than any
other group. ``We honestly don't know.''
   In its first-quarter report, issued last week, Gannett profits
rose by only the narrowest of margins, from $74.9 million a year
ago to $75 million this year.
   Curley sees the newspaper recession as regional rather than
nationwide. He linked it to last winter's bankruptcy protection
filing by the Campeau Corp., the Toronto-based conglomerate that
controlled some of this country's best-known retail stores,
including Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus and Abraham &amp;
Straus.
   ``West is best,'' Curley said, noting that the Southwest,
recovering from the oil crisis, is doing well. ``Northwest is
second-best. Midwest is more down than out. Southeast is mostly
down _ that's retail related. Northeast is worst, with automotive
ads a big factor.''
   Craig Standen, president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, an
arm of ANPA, stressed that newspapers aren't the only media-related
companies suffering.
   ``The whole media market, the advertising business, is not going
as fast as it has in the past,'' he said. ``Yes, it's a problem for
newspapers. But I don't think it means something is structurally
wrong with newspapers.''
   Declining readership was the other major problem troubling
publishers. It was the topic of panel discussions, speeches and
workshops. Poor education was denounced. More literacy was demanded.
   A note of hope was sounded by Steven L. Isenberg, associate
publisher of Newsday, who said that in spite of a general economic
downturn, New York remains a bastion of newspaper readers.
   ``In New York City, the number of people who read two or more
papers a day is remarkable,'' he said, adding, ``Opinion is the
mother's milk of New York life. We give them columnists with
different opinions and views, and they come back with a real
signature of daily life.''
   Isenberg warned that while newspapers are besieged with
financial woes, they shouldn't forget their underlying purpose.
``Newspapers are part of helping us to be intelligent citizens,''
he said.
   ``We are an engine of democracy and we have a responsibility to
the whole community,'' said C. Shelby Coffey III, editor and
executive vice president of the Los Angeles Times.
   ``I think newspapers are central to the survival of a free
society,'' said John E. Cox, Jr., president of the Foundation for
American Communications.
   Their statements could be taken as an echo of the enthusiastic
standing ovation the 1,600 ANPA members gave to two special guests
_ the publishers of a Bogota, Colombia, newspaper that fought that
country's drug lords and managed to publish after its plant was
bombed. No mention was made of the paper's advertising and
circulation numbers.

<HEAD>Secrecy Accords on Hazardous Products Debated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocates, attorneys and journalists
say court agreements that allow companies to keep information about
potential hazards involving their products secret are endangering
lives and public safety.
   However, corporate lawyers argue that such arrangements are a
legitimate part of the civil justice system, offer an alternative
to lengthy court battles and help protect trade secrets of U.S.
businesses and American competitiveness.
   ``Secrecy buries critical facts ... and the public good is
ignored and damaged,'' Russ Herman, president of the Association of
Trial Lawyers of America, said April 25 at a conference on secrecy
sponsored by his group.
   Information discovered during product liability litigation
``ought to be made available to the public so the danger isn't
repeated over and over again,'' he added.
   In many instances that includes ``documents and decisions
involving unsafe products, dangerous drugs, toxic wastes _ all with
potentially devastating effect on people unaware of the danger,''
said Paul McMasters, deputy editorial director of USA Today.
   McMaster heads the freedom of information committee of the
Society of Professional Journalists, cosponsor of the conference.
   Protective orders, confidentiality agreements or court sealing
of files in product liability cases prohibit lawsuit participants
from distributing any of the information obtained, limit what can
be shared with others not involved in the lawsuit or make all
records in a case unavailable.
   One corporate defense attorney said that opening court records
could violate privacy by revealing sensitive information about
businesses or individuals.
   ``If you can summons my medical records from my doctor, my diary
from my psychiatrist or records of design from a company ...
privacy goes out the window,'' said James Morris III, a Virginia
lawyer.
   Opponents to secrecy should not be allowed to use the court
system to disseminate information that might not otherwise be
available, Morris said.
   Devra Davis, a toxicologist at the National Academy of Sciences,
said some secrets could harm public health.
   Davis said that in January 1983, she suffered a nearly fatal
allergic reaction to the prescription painkiller Zomax, which was
eventually withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer.
   Later she discovered the manufacturer, doctors and other
patients had known of the possible severe reaction but the
information was not available because of secrecy agreements
obtained in product liability case settlements by McNeil
Pharmaceutical, the drug manufacturer.

<HEAD>Justices Hear Arguments in Ohio Libel Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on April 24 grappled with an
important libel law issue contained in a former high school
wrestling coach's 15-year-old lawsuit against an Ohio newspaper.
   The court is being asked to decide whether the Constitution's
free-speech protections immunize all expressions of opinion, as
opposed to assertions of fact, from libel lawsuits.
   First, however, the justices may have to tell judges nationwide
how to distinguish fact from opinion.
   The fact-opinion distinction is important. Courts traditionally
have barred libel suits over expressions of opinion even though the
high court never has said explicitly that such protection is
constitutionally required.
   The justices spent much of the April 24 session trying to figure
out whether to put a ``fact'' or ``opinion'' tag on a 1975 sports
column that accused Michael Milkovich of lying under oath.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia
and Anthony M. Kennedy asked the most questions. All three seemed
to consider the statement at the heart of the suit to be an
assertion of fact.
   Questions from Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor
and Byron R. White were more difficult to characterize. Justices
William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun asked
no questions.
   The column was written by Ted Diadiun and appeared in the News
Herald of Lake County, published by the Lorain Journal Co.
   Milkovich was coaching Maple Heights High School's wrestling
team at a 1974 home meet against Mentor High School when a melee
involving both teams and spectators erupted. Several wrestlers were
hospitalized.
   Diadiun, who was at the meet, wrote several articles criticizing
Milkovich's conduct.
   In a Jan. 8, 1975, column, Diadiun accused the coach and H. Don
Scott, then superintendent of the Maple Heights public schools, of
lying to a judge who overturned disciplinary measures against the
Maple Heights team.
   During extensive litigation, Milkovich won two preliminary
rounds before the Ohio Supreme Court. In a 1984 decision, the state
court ruled that Diadiun's statements about Milkovich were reported
as fact, not opinion.
   But in ruling on Scott's related libel suit two years later, the
Ohio Supreme Court reversed its 1984 ruling and said Diadiun's
statements were expressions of his opinion.
   In an unusual move, the Ohio court used its Aug. 6, 1986,
decision in Scott's case to doom as well Milkovich's suit against
the newspaper and Diadiun.
   Holding up a 1975 headline that said Milkovich ``Beat the Law
with the Big Lie,'' Milkovich attorney Brent English of Cleveland
told the justices, ``This is quintessentially an assertion of
fact.''
   But Richard Panza of Lorain, Ohio, argued for the newspaper and
Diadiun that ``when people read sports columns they expect to read
opinion.''
   Gusts of laughter filled the courtroom after Justice Kennedy
responded, ``I gave up reading sports columns because there's
nothing but legal news in them.''
   Panza's most persistent interrogator was Justice Scalia, who at
one point asked him, ``Doesn't it trouble you that people's
reputations can be destroyed this way?''
   Panza said, ``Yes, it does trouble me.'' He then quickly added
that the column at issue was not libelous.
   Diadiun, 42 and now an editor with The Plain Dealer in
Cleveland, watched the session from the courtroom's press section.
   Milkovich, 68 and recovering from triple bypass heart surgery,
did not attend. In a recent interview, he told The New York Times
he was too weak to make the trip from his Maple Heights home.
   A decision is expected by July.
   The case is Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co., 89-645.

<HEAD>High Court Reinstates Coach's Libel Case Against Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A libel case stemming from a Pulitzer
Prize-winning series on improprieties in college athletics was
reinstated April 26 against the Lexington Herald-Leader by the
Kentucky Supreme Court.
   The court ruled that Reggie Warford, a former assistant
basketball coach at the University of Pittsburgh, was not a public
figure and did not have to prove the newspaper printed the story
maliciously.
   Warford was accused in the articles of offering money to a
recruit, and has been out of coaching work since the series was
published, his lawyer said.
   ``He's tried, but the stigma that has been attached to him, it's
almost like a blackball in his profession,'' attorney Larry Roberts
said.
   Warford has held a series of part-time jobs in the Pittsburgh
area, including as a juvenile probation officer and in a sporting
goods store, Roberts said.
   Herald-Leader Editor John Carroll said he disagreed with the
court's ruling and feared it would have a chilling effect on
freedom of speech in Kentucky. Carroll said the newspaper would
likely ask for a review of the ruling, possibly by the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   The newspaper reported that Warford offered to split an expected
raise with Steve Miller, a highly sought high school player in
Lexington, if Miller would attend Pittsburgh. Miller enrolled at
Western Kentucky University.
   The allegation was first published in the fall of 1985 and again
in 1986 in a special edition entitled ``1985: A Year of Crisis in
College Athletics.'' It is the reprint, which was sent to all NCAA
member schools and coaches, that is at the heart of the libel
action.
   Miller retracted his statement after the first publication, but
the retraction was not included in the reprint, the court ruling
said. Warford's denial of any improper offer was included in the
reports.
   The court's opinion by Justice Joseph Lambert said conclusive
evidence was offered during the first trial that little attempt was
made to verify Miller's story.
   The opinion noted that the reporters knew of the allegation for
months but did not contact Warford until just before the first
publication. ``From the foregoing, a jury could reasonably believe
that (they) were committed to running the story without regard to
its truth or falsity,'' Lambert said.
   The newspaper won in a judge's directed verdict when the case
went to trial, on the basis that Warford had been a public figure.
   During Warford's appeal the newspaper said there was an ongoing
public debate about recruiting violations in college athletics.
Warford's position as an assistant coach and recruiter made him a
public figure, which would require him to meet a higher standard of
proof that he was defamed, the newspaper's argument said.
   But the high court said there was no particular controversy at
Pittsburgh at the time that would have thrust Warford into the
public spotlight.
   ``We agree ... that the heart of the issue before us is whether
(Warford's) employment was such that he accepted or assumed the
risk of public scrutiny. We conclude that he did not,'' Lambert
wrote.

<HEAD>Police File Libel Suit Against Weekly Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVERETT, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four police officers filed a libel suit
April 24 against the owners of a weekly newspaper after failing in
a legal bid to stop the paper from writing about them.
   The suit against Buddie H. and Jennelle S. Williams, publishers
of the Sky Valley Messenger, claims the newspaper published
unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, brutality and
theft by the officers. Williams has said he can substantiate
everything he has written.
   Police Chief Karl Gilje, officers Scott Fenter and Blair Hawkins
and reserve officer Rick Fenter, all of Sultan, earlier obtained a
court order barring the paper from printing stories about them.
   The restraining order was overturned by another judge who ruled
that the officers failed to show an emergency existed to justify it.
   The libel suit seeks unspecified damages for ``harassment,
slander, libel committed by the defendants.''
   The Messenger covers the towns of Sultan, Gold Bar, Index and
Skykomish east of Everett and has a circulation of about 2,000.

<HEAD>Union Brings Suit Over Dues Deductions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pacific Northwest Newspaper Guild has filed a
federal lawsuit against the Bellevue Journal-American, seeking
resolution of a dispute over the deduction of union dues from
employee paychecks.
   Northwest Media Inc., which publishes the newspaper, has refused
to deduct union dues since its contract with the union expired Dec.
31, the guild said in a news release April 24.
   Guild members have signed cards authorizing the newspaper to
withhold union dues from their paychecks. The union contends the
company's refusal to deduct the dues directly interferes with the
contract between the guild and its members.
   Media Northwest's actions are causing ``irreparable harm to the
union'' and the newspaper's union employees, the lawsuit says.
   Bob Weil, the newspaper's publisher, was out of town, had not
seen the suit April 30 and had no immediate comment.
   The lawsuit asks the court to order the newspaper to deduct the
dues until the matter has been decided by an arbitrator. It also
asks for back dues, legal fees and unspecified damages.
   The lawsuit was filed after the company's denial of a grievance
filed Jan. 29 by the guild over the deductions, and the company's
refusal to submit the dispute to binding arbitration, the union
said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Loses Appeal of Court Decision Over Contract Disclosure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   School districts can withhold details of
tentative union contracts until the contracts are ratified, the
Michigan Court of Appeals ruled in a decision released April 19.
   The appellate court upheld a ruling by Judge William Brown that
blocked the Traverse City Record-Eagle from obtaining details of a
Traverse City teachers' contract prior to its ratification.
   ``Premature disclosure of the tentative agreement would have a
negative impact on the negotiation process,'' the appeals court
wrote.
   ``Confidentiality is necessary to maintain frank communication
between the union and the school board. Frank communication, in
turn, leads to effective negotiation which, the (circuit) court
concluded, outweighed the public's right to disclosure.''
   The newspaper sued the Traverse City Area Public Schools in
January 1988. Then-Superintendent Vernon Oxender cited an ``unusual
circumstance'' clause in the Freedom of Information Act in refusing
to release details of the contract until it was ratified.
   Brown ruled in February 1989 that schools can't be forced to
disclose tentative contracts.

<HEAD>Minnesota Law Strengthens Open Meetings Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota House voted unanimously
April 23 for a bill that places further limits on the ability of
governmental bodies to hold closed meetings.
   The legislation was drafted in response to a state supreme court
ruling last year that said meetings must be closed when information
classified as private under the state's Data Practices Act is
discussed.
   The ruling required local governmental bodies to ``close the
meeting and kick out the public and kick out the media'' when they
wanted to discuss private data, said Rep. Phil Carruthers, who
helped draft the new law.
   ``That meant that a lot of meetings were being closed that
really didn't need to be, and it seemed inappropriate, inconsistent
with the idea of the open meeting law,'' he said.
   The new legislation prohibits local governmental units from
closing meetings to discuss private data, with some exceptions,
such as when it would identify alleged victims of criminal sexual
conduct.
   The bill also says that during an open meeting a public body
shall make reasonable efforts to protect private data from public
disclosure. For instance, it suggests that local officials protect
the identity of some people by using a number or letter of the
alphabet when referring to them.
   ``It lays out the specifics of which prevails, openness or
privacy, in which types of circumstances, so I think it will be a
lot easier for local governments to deal with and a lot easier for
the public and for the media,'' Carruthers said.
   The Minnesota Newspaper Association was a key backer of the new
bill, which passed the House 128-0 and the Senate 46-0.

<HEAD>City of Indianapolis Settles Suit Involving AP Staffers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former Indiana news editor for The
Associated Press will receive $17,500 in a settlement of a lawsuit
stemming from his arrest at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1986.
   The city agreed to pay that amount to Lindel G. Hutson and
$2,500 to former AP newswoman Fran Richardson, who was cut by glass
after police broke the windshield of Hutson's car.
   In their lawsuit, Hutson said he was falsely arrested and Ms.
Richardson said she suffered mental anguish. Hutson had originally
sought $425,580 from the city and three Indianapolis police
officers. Richardson had sought $60,000 from the city and policeman
Terry D. Kennard.
   The lawsuit arose from a May 25, 1986, incident involving
Hutson, now chief of the AP's Oklahoma City bureau, and Ms.
Richardson, now a Hoosier Lottery spokeswoman, as they tried to
enter the Speedway to cover the Indianapolis 500.
   Police said Hutson was improperly attempting to enter the
track's main gate and ignored their instructions. Hutson was
arrested, charged with criminal recklessness and jailed for more
than four hours. A jury acquitted him on charges of battery and
disorderly conduct.
   At the trial, a policeman testified he was struck twice by
Hutson's car. But other witnesses testified that they didn't see
the car strike anyone and that they saw officers strike Hutson and
pound his car with nightsticks, smashing the windshield.
   Kennard was later suspended for three days without pay for his
role following a department investigation.
   ``It's been a long time. I'm just glad that it's all over,''
Hutson said April 26.

   The first black editor of the University of
Mississippi newspaper was chosen April 25 by a panel formed after

politicians instead of journalists.
   Lee Eric Smith was chosen over three other candidates to run the
Daily Mississippian by a panel of students, professional
journalists and staff, said Samir Hussni, journalism professor and
chairman of the selection board.
   For 50 years editors have been elected, sometimes after spending
hundreds of dollars on posters and fliers. Critics said
fraternities and sororities controlled the annual elections,
turning them into popularity contests.
   Students protested this spring and the newspaper's staff
produced an edition with several blank pages to show its
displeasure with the system. Another edition contained the U.S.
Constitution published three times in place of news stories. In
March, the student government voted to do away with elections and
create the selection committee.
   Ole Miss was the site of race riots in 1962 after a court
ordered that a black student be admitted. About 20 students work on
the editorial side of the 10,000-circulation paper.

<HEAD>Newspaper Pulls Advertisement After Readers Call It Ethnic Slur</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Milwaukee Journal on April 24 pulled
advertisements featuring Polish leader Lech Walesa speaking in
broken English after complaints that the ad amounted to an ethnic
slur.
   The Journal used newspaper, television and radio advertisements
featuring Walesa and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to
promote its new page designs, unveiled in April.
   The Walesa newspaper advertisement showed a photo of the Nobel
Prize-winning founder of Poland's Solidarity movement with the
words: ``Very long I have hoped for changes so significant as those
in new Milwaukee Journal.''
   The Thatcher ad pictures the prime minister with the words ``Why
yes, the American colonies have progressed. Consider the recent
changes in your Milwaukee Journal.''
   Both ads involved contrived quotes.
   Robert Dye, spokesman for the Journal, said the ads were
intended to be ``lighthearted spoofs'' and that both were pulled.
   ``I guess it just didn't click,'' Dye said. ``It didn't have the
impact we intended. The original intent was that it be fun. As soon
as we realized it wasn't working, we pulled the ads.''
   The quarter-page Walesa ad ran in the April 23 Journal. It drew
an immediate letter from Mayor John O. Norquist, who complained the
use of the broken English ``shows an obvious lack of respect for
Walesa and for Polish culture.''
   ``I'm sure that since English is not his native language, he
probably does not speak it as well as you do,'' Norquist wrote to
Journal Editor Sig Gissler. ``At the same time, I wonder how well
you speak Polish.''
   The head of the city's annual Polish ethnic festival charged the
television advertisement featuring Walesa was even more offensive
to Poles.
   ``I thought it rather demeaning to the Polish ethnic groups,''
said Richard Gralinski, executive director of Polish Fest. ``I
certainly thought it was an ethnic slur.''
   Milwaukee, a city of about 600,000 people, has more than 180,000
residents of Polish ancestry, Gralinski said.

   Sandinista dominance of the media appeared to begin easing a bit
last year when prior censorship ended. The Sandinistas also gave
the opposition a bit of television time during the campaign.
   After they lost the Feb. 25 election, the Sandinistas lifted the
ban on private television and began moving to ensure for themselves
a firm grip on the public eye and ear.
   ``They are trying to dominate the dial,'' said Frank Arana, a
member of the UNO transition team for media matters.
   One of the new TV licenses went to the vehemently pro-Sandinista
publishers of the newspaper El Nuevo Diario. Another, Channel 4,
will be run by a top Sandinista official, Tourism Minister Herty
Lewites.
   Meanwhile, a new transmission tower has sprouted at what used to
be the Sandinista campaign headquarters, the home of a new
Sandinista radio station, Radio Ya (Radio Now!).
   The UNO transition team only learned last week that the
state-run radio network had been dismantled, Arana said.
   ``We were morally deceived,'' he said. ``But not surprised.''
   Barricada, the Sandinista party's official newspaper, said the
idea was to put the radio stations in the hands of people
``concerned with promoting culture and ethical values and morals
that benefit the great majority'' and to ensure ``the continuation
of participative radio and guarantee communication for ordinary
people.''

<HEAD>Cuba Extends Jamming of Radio Marti Past Sunrise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba began jamming the U.S. government's Radio
Marti broadcasts on April 24, said a spokeswoman for the Voice of
America, which runs the service.
   VOA spokeswoman Beth Knisley quoted a Cuban government statement
acknowledging the jamming. She said the station can still be heard
on shortwave radios.
   Until April, Cuba had not interfered with Radio Marti except for
a humming sound that impaired the quality of the broadcasts.
   The new jamming appeared to be related to the advent of TV
Marti, the televised version of Radio Marti that began testing in
March.
   At a news conference three weeks ago, President Fidel Castro
suggested that the TV Marti tests could provoke a crackdown on
Radio Marti.

   Television station WSYX news anchor
Michelle Gailiun and two co-workers were suspended without pay for
allowing profanities on the air, a station official said.
   The incidents involved the approval of two brief clips in news
stories that contained the offensive language on the station's 11
p.m. broadcast April 25.
   News Director Carl Twentier said Ms. Gailiun approved a story on
the recent shootings in an Atlanta mall. A suspect used the word
``goddamned.''
   Also suspended were Amy Walters, producer of the 11 p.m. news,
and reporter Sara Vesser.
   In a local story reported by Ms. Vesser and approved by Ms.
Walters, an interviewee comenting on vandalism used the term
``pissed off.''
   ``In both instances, the language is gratuitous and unnecessary
in the context of the story,'' Twentier said. ``There are contexts
when that kind of language might belong on the air. But this was
done too casually.''
   Ms. Gailiun said the suspension was extreme.
   ``I don't like tampering with the authenticity of quotes,'' she
said. ``I thought it was entirely reasonable to use it.''

was named managing editor of the San Antonio News in 1955, and in
1958 became executive editor of the Express and the News, which at
that time were separate newspapers.
   In 1971, he was named publisher of the News and in 1972
publisher of both papers. When Rupert Murdoch bought the company in
1973, Kilpatrick was asked to continue as publisher and editor.
   Walker joined the San Francisco Newspaper Agency in 1982. He is

   When the Russians downed a U.S. spy plane in the

of their own aircraft out of the sky, killing the pilot, the Soviet

   The U-2 plane, piloted by Francis Gary Powers, was shot down on

between President Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev
and forcing the cancellation of another summit planned for later
that year.
   The newspaper Red Star said in the article Sunday that the
Soviets mistakenly shot down a MiG-19 and its pilot in the

   The paper also disclosed that the Soviets sent up a new fighter
plane and ordered its pilot to ram the U-2 in a suicide mission.
The new fighter reached the U-2's altitude but failed to ram it.

   Town zoning officials, acting on a complaint from a neighbor,

<TEXT>
   First they liked Ike, then they didn't like
Ike, then they liked Ike again: that's the pattern of historians'
appraisal of Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose place in history is still
to be fixed.
   Writing in the centennial year of Eisenhower's birth, historian
Alan Brinkley says there's something to be learned about America
and the American people from Eisenhower's see-saw reputation.
   Brinkley's view is pertinent since George Bush's presidency is
sometimes compared to Eisenhower's.
   Bush, like Ike, is prudent, uneager to expand government's role.
Like Ike, Bush is accused of lacking vision. Like Ike, Bush
presides at a time of peace and prosperity and is accused of doing
nothing about problems looming just below the surface.
   Bush, like Ike, is enormously popular in the polls. At this
stage, he seems as unbeatable as Ike was when he ran for
re-election in 1956.
   When people are suspicious of government, have been disappointed
by it and expect little from it, says Brinkley, their appreciation
rises for Eisenhower and his safe but inactive tenure.
   When people look to government for bold leadership and vision,
he says, do-nothing Ike falls in repute.
   Brinkley, a 1971 graduate of Princeton who was a snip of a lad
when Eisenhower was president, is professor of history at the
graduate school of the City University of New York. He reviews the
record in the Wilson Quarterly, a magazine published by the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars.
   Jimmy Carter is undergoing the same sort of reappraisal that's
been Eisenhower's fate.
   Carter's stance as an outsider and his ``I'll-never-lie-to-you''
campaign seemed just the antidote to the disillusionments of
Vietnam and Watergate. But, plagued by events beyond his control _
the Iran hostage crisis and the oil embargo _ he left office
condemned as ineffective.
   Lately, building on his peacemaker's reputation forged in the
Camp David accord, Carter has been winning fresh respect for his
selfless pursuit of a better world.
   In Eisenhower's case, he was much loved by a people he did not
much lead.
   His presidency, says Brinkley, ``mirrored the success and
complacency that characterized much of American life during the
1950s,'' the ``I Love Lucy'' era.
   Genial Ike, war hero, played golf and bridge and palled around
with rich businessmen. Despite his popularity, historians started
finding fault with his record even before he left office.
   ``Throughout the 1960s and much of the 1970s, scholars dismissed
Eisenhower as a bland mediocrity, a model of what a 20th-century
president should not be,'' Brinkley says.
   A 1962 poll of historians ranked Eisenhower 22nd out of 33
presidents, just above Chester A. Arthur. The charge was that he
failed to govern or inspire. Historians saw him as passive,
ineffective, even ``vaguely stupid,'' Brinkley recalls.
   By the end of the 1970s, however, a new verdict was taking hold,
partially because the Eisenhower papers had become available to
scholarship.
   No longer seen as the stumblebum, Ike now was regarded as
decisive and skillful, articulate, informed and commanding.
   In a new poll, in 1982, historians ranked him ninth, above John
F. Kennedy.
   This was post-Vietnam and post-Watergate. Ike was seen as having
shrewdly known the limits of American power.
   The evaluation arose from ``the profound disillusionment with
social activism that began during the late 1960s; the association
of liberalism with Vietnam, with economic instability, with racial
conflict and with the disappointing results of social-policy
initiatives,'' Brinkley says.
   What doomed Ike to condescension was ``his refusal to accept the
idea that government had a great and compelling mission,'' says
Brinkley.
   What raised him in estimation were those same qualities, he
says, at ``a time when many Americans came to question the
desirability of a powerful president and the feasibility of a large
and active government.''
   ``Nothing in Dwight D. Eisenhower's uneventful presidency
ensures him an important place in political history. He was not a
Lincoln or Wilson or Roosevelt, who led the nation through great
crises,'' says Brinkley. ``He was not a Kennedy or Johnson or
Nixon, who, for better or worse, charted new paths and left the
nation's public life forever altered.''
   Brinkley's verdict: Ike's reputation will remain ``a hostage to
Americans' fluctuating expectations of their leaders and their
state.''

   It seemed for a while that the economy was
coming in for a soft, safe landing, with the Federal Reserve deftly
working the instrument panel. But now the red lights are flashing.
   Already pinched, consumers find themselves paying higher prices
for basics such as vegetables and fruits, meats, beverages,
gasoline. Mortgage rates are rising, and rental rates are rising
even faster.
   With many states falling far behind their anticipated revenues,
taxes seem to have only one direction to go. Little hints are
dropped here and there that the Fed might be ready to raise
interest rates again.
   Corporate profits are down; they've been falling for more than a
year, but in that time corporate dividends were raised. Now, unless
an unexpected profits surge ensues, it is likely that dividend cuts
will become more common.
   Even without that prospect, the stock market has little push,
and the bond market even less. The latter is a distinct surprise to
a great many investors, who felt confident that prices would rise
and rates fall.
   The savings and loan debacle seems to expand a few billion
dollars every time one looks, and as it does the confidence of
Americans suffers the more. Weren't these lenders supposed to know
what they were doing?
   Now that the damage has been done, these same lenders and others
affected by them are clamping down hard. Good small companies are
being denied credit, not because they don't deserve it but because
the lenders are frightened.
   The so-called peace dividend has become a peace layoff; General
Electric has just announced it will eliminate 4,200 aerospace jobs.
Lockheed said it would lay off 2,750 workers in its aeronautical
systems component.
   Meanwhile, downward movement in the federal budget deficit seems
to become more difficult every day. Improvement in the trade
deficit could be difficult as well, if inflation and higher rates
raise U.S. production costs.
   In an economic sense, it's not much of a spring. You might say
the clouds hang low and the sun is in hiding, just when people were
looking forward to buying houses and vacationing and getting on
with postponed projects.
   Such matters add up, in an economic sense, to a case of spring
fever, a sense of dolefulness that sometimes snares people, just as
they thought they'd be feeling better.
   Sulphur and molasses is an age-old recipe for spring fever, and
here's its economic equivalent, something to lift your spirits and
help develop the brighter side of things.
   _Economic swings of mood are common. If you analyzed the media
over the past year you would find alternating periods of hope and
pessimism, not always based on changes in the economic fundamentals.
   _Sometimes the statistical data is skewed. In the first quarter
of the year, when inflation seemed to be gaining a strong foothold,
high prices of several items might have been temporary, or
distorted by methodology.
   Oil prices already have fallen sharply. The 21 percent
first-quarter rise of apparel prices might have been misstated
because of the lateness of Easter, after which clothing prices
often are marked down.
   Says Prudential Bache economist Edward Yardeni: ``The CPI
inflation rate during the second quarter could be as low as 1
percent because the first-quarter number was boosted by a number of
one-time aberrations, mostly weather related.''
   _Free-market industrial economies _ all of them, everywhere _
are cyclical. They are forever in motion, either up or down. When
they are down, they are regrouping to move up. When they are up
they are forever in danger of falling.
   _Higher interest rates, if they come, will eventually help to
squelch inflation. The two might exist side by side for a while,
but it is unlikely they can co-exist, as they did in the 1970s, for
several years.
   _There are advantages to a weak economy. Interest rates
eventually fall. Housing becomes more affordable, if only
temporarily. Consumers and businesses retrench, cut waste and do
without, getting better value for the dollar.
   _Muddling through is as old as tradition. It has worked before.

   The Mississippi Delta is a rich land, yet its
people are perhaps the poorest in the nation. The region has
staggering rates of poverty, illiteracy, teen-age pregnancy and
infant mortality, illustrating how hard times can weigh heaviest on
the youngest members of society. This first report in a five-day AP
Extra series, ``Children of the Delta,'' examines what decades of
neglect have done to the region's children, and what's being done
to help.

   Willie Mae Watson lives with her
six children and 11 grandchildren in a four-room shanty without
plumbing or even an outhouse, 18 people sheltered by little more
than plywood walls and a torn tin roof.
   Not far away, 22-year-old Flora Knight, barely an adult herself,
struggles to earn a high school diploma while raising her six
children _ ages 7, 6, 5, 3, 2 and 4 months.
   ``They don't have too good a chance,'' she said. ``I don't think
they'll have a job waiting here for them, even if they go to school
and finish.''
   The mighty river and loamy soil of the Mississippi Delta, from
downstate Illinois to Louisiana's Gulf Coast, form one of the most
abundant basins on Earth, yielding agricultural treasures for the
rest of the world.
   Why, then, does this land that Mark Twain called ``the body of
the nation'' not support its own children?
   Why do a higher percentage of people here live in extreme
poverty than do in Appalachia? Why do the rich cargoes of the
river's barges and tankers just pass these children by?
   The Delta ranks higher than some Third World countries in infant
mortality. Unemployment runs 60 percent above the national average,
and per capita income _ only $10,192 _ averages 25 percent less.
Yet the region is almost invisible to most Americans.
   Why?
   The answer seems to center on age-old bias and modern neglect.
The Delta, which gave birth to the blues, is a victim of decades of
racism, economic failure and indifference, according to a federal
commission that has studied the seven-state region of 8 million
people for 1{ years.
   Next week, members of the Lower Mississippi Delta Development
Commission will report to Congress on how to stimulate growth in
the area, which covers parts of Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana.
   But forging a better future for the 3 million children of the
Delta will take more than suggestions in a report.
   ``This ain't no good place to grow up, but we try our best,''
said Mavis Watson, one of the 18 people living in the shack on the
Panther Burn Plantation here.
   Despite a concerted effort among states to improve their
schools, a pattern of poor education scares off employers and their
potential jobs. Too many people fail to take advantage of the
meager medical care available, and environmental troubles compound
health problems.
   Agriculture remains the dominant industry, but jobs have been
lost to mechanization. Many of the poor here, most of them black,
find only minimum-wage seasonal labor at harvest time. Most find
work so rarely that they don't even qualify for unemployment
benefits.
   ``I hear people say nothing good ever going to happen here,''
said Bubba Sullivan, who runs an eclectic blues record store in
Helena, Ark. ``If you don't have industry you don't have a middle
class. You can't blame kids on welfare.''
   Unskilled, uneducated and without savings, they can't find a way
to a better life. Too often, their children are chained to a future
as bleak as the past.
   Rates of teen-age pregnancy, dropouts and youth unemployment are
among the nation's worst. In some counties, a higher percentage of
babies die than in French Guiana or Malaysia. One county,
Mississippi's Tunica, has been called ``America's Ethiopia.''
   People matter-of-factly relate horror stories, from a
10-year-old boy lighting scraps of paper in his house for warmth to
a child saved by $100,000 worth of medical treatment at a
university hospital only to return home to a shack and die from rat
bites.
   The 1980 census found more than one-third of all housing lacked
either complete plumbing or central heating. Despite federal
programs that replaced some dilapidated shacks, crumbling houses
are common.
   Role models _ the people with grit and drive _ mostly move away.
Those who earn degrees or learn skills can't find jobs that pay
well, so they head elsewhere.
   Louisiana, for example, once kept 70 percent of the doctors it
educated and trained. Now only 30 percent stay, according to Greg
Bowser of the Louisiana Health Care Authority.
   ``Our biggest export? People,'' said Stan Hyland, a Memphis
State University anthropologist working with the commission.
   Welfare payments through Aid to Families with Dependent Children
amounted to almost $340 million in 1986 in the 214 counties of the
Delta region. And that was only a fraction of government transfer
payments to the Delta's poor: almost $2 billion, excluding Medicare
and Medicaid.
   Even with such spending, the most basic want can be found in the
countless tiny towns and clusters of farmworkers' houses edging the
flat croplands.
   ``When you're getting children ready to go to school and they
don't have the proper clothes to put on, and they're old enough to
know that this is not the way they're supposed to go to school,
we've found that that is causing a lot of our dropouts,'' said the
Rev. Bertha Thurman of Belzoni, Miss. ``They're ashamed.''
   Ms. Thurman is raising a 16-year-old foster daughter and the
daughter's 2-year-old son on food stamps and her income from
cleaning houses.
   ``You've just got to have a heart full of love, and you can't
buy groceries with it, either,'' she said. ``Make you pray a whole
lot.''

   At the northern end of the Delta region, Cairo, Ill.,
businesswoman Helen Bishoff sees children similarly disadvantaged.
   ``There's nothing as an alternative to drinking and drugs and
standing around on street corners and sitting on hoods of cars. We
do not have a movie theater. There's no teen center,'' said Ms.
Bishoff, who is pushing to get a center built.
   ``There's no enrichment for these children, nothing to show them
the world beyond.''
   For many children in the Delta, said Rims Barber, who has worked
with the poor in Mississippi since 1964, ``life is only something
that happens to them. They're only passive players. ... Ask me what
I might do tonight, I can handle that. Ask me what I might do when
I grow up, I can't handle that.''
   Annie Brown is working to change things, but she's found people
aren't always eager for change.
   Mrs. Brown, daughter of a sharecropper, runs a literacy program
in Rolling Fork, Miss., that she started in 1985 with classes
around a card table in her funeral home. Twenty-seven adults have
since earned high school diplomas.
   ``Illiteracy is a poisonous disease to our children,'' said Mrs.
Brown, who thunders with the fiery passion of a preacher when
describing how white residents fought her efforts for fear of
losing cooks, maids and farmhands.
   ``Here, you have to push, you have to demand, you have to say,
`This is what we are going to do,''' she said. ``I get knocked down
sometimes, but I bounce back like a rubber ball.''
   Blacks and whites in the Delta agree leaders in the past were
reluctant to move away from the agricultural economy that so
enriched the land-owners.
   Development lagged, river ports lost business, and the nation's
motherland was left to fall further and further behind.
   If progress is to be made, attitudes must change, including a
``plantation orientation'' lingering from the days of slave and
master, said Emma Cooper-Harris, who runs a community development
organization in Rolling Fork.
   ``This goes way back beyond what the eye can see,'' she said.
   ``My daddy is illiterate, but he had visions for his children.
He'd often tell us _ and give us a paddling if he thought that we
weren't doing what we were supposed to have done in school _
`because I want you to grow up and be somebody. I don't want you to
have to work on this farm like I have ever since I was 8 years
old.' He had visions for us.
   ``You've got teen parents in the 10th grade, and their children
are in kindergarten. We have sixth- and seventh-graders that have
had abortions. I'm empty when I talk about it.''
   Martha Ann Michael, a mother prodding her three children to
study in their 15-by-30-foot shack outside Cary, Miss., tries her
best to preach the value of education to her children.
   ``My baby,'' she said of her 6-year-old daughter, ``she's an
honor roll student.''
   The family survives on food stamps and $144-a-month welfare and
hopes simply to reach the top of a long waiting list for
comparatively spacious public housing.
   When there's work at a local cotton gin, she pays off backlogged
bills and tries to set aside something for small Christmas or
birthday presents.
   If she could change things? ``My children would have everything
they wanted,'' she said.
   ``And what do I want? I want me a job.''

<HEAD>Commission to Offer Roadmap for Decade of Mississippi Delta Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal commission studying the
Mississippi Delta region for 18 months will offer a roadmap for
slow, gradual economic improvement when it issues its final report
to Congress next week.
   The Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission will call for
greater regional cooperation, such as environmental compacts and
university research consortiums, extra help in steering kids to
college, ``leadership training'' to change entrenched attitudes
that have held the Delta back, and some government aid.
   Despite stressing the need for more help from the federal
government, Govs. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Buddy Roemer of
Louisiana and Ray Mabus of Mississippi, all of whom serve on the
nine-member commission, say they won't be asking for a quick-fix or
a vast New Deal-type program.
   ``If there is a peace dividend ... you want to invest in
America, why not start here?'' Roemer said.
   ``The work of this commission is not about handouts, though.
It's about giving choices and some options to people who too often
feel they have none,'' he said.
   Added Wilbur Hawkins, the federal commission's executive
director: ``We bail out the savings and loans, we send millions to
Poland and to Panama. I just don't want this nation, for the first
time in its history, to say we can't help the unfortunate.''
   The Memphis-based commission has not been without controversy.
Black leaders reacted angrily when all nine panelists appointed
were white men, even though one-third of the Delta's population is
black. Hawkins, hired after the uproar, is black.
   The commission, which has spent $3 million on its study, was
modeled after past federal bodies appointed to deal with regional
problems, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and the
Appalachian Regional Commission.
   But Clinton, the commission chairman, said he believes the
document released May 14 will be unique in government.
   ``It will literally be a handbook for a decade of action,'' he
said. ``We want a report that says what the national government is
supposed to do, what the state governments are supposed to do, the
local governments and the private sector.''
   Tourism will be one area the commission hopes to help develop,
officials said. Marketing will be another; some on the commission
hope for a Common Market-type cooperation among the states, and
perhaps even a Mississippi Delta logo and promotional campaign for
local products.
   ``People on Wall Street see more attractive investments in
Venezuela than in the Mississippi Delta, and that's a marketing
problem,'' said Stan Hyland, a Memphis State University
anthropologist working on the commission staff.
   ``We've got to put in place incentives to bring our youth back
home, and our capital back home,'' Hawkins said.
   ``We can't just afford to take a Band-Aid approach.''

   Counties included in the Mississippi Delta
region have long held the dubious distinction of having some of
America's poorest and most troubled schools. Illiteracy and dropout
rates are high, money is scarce and the legacy of a troubled racial
past compounds the problems. But in recent years, several states
have made education reform a priority. This second report in a
five-day AP Extra series, ``Children of the Delta,'' examines one
Tennessee school district struggling to break the cycle of failure.

   When Warner Dickerson strides the
school halls in this poor patch of Tennessee, he confronts the
traditions that rend young lives.
   He sees girls who've become mothers too soon and boys who'll
give up on school too early, the children of men and women who
mostly grew up the same way.
   A new generation, an old predicament, a common denominator.
   ``If you had to sum it up with a word or expression, it's
poverty,'' said Dickerson, superintendent of the Fayette County
schools. ``Your morality is different. Your long-range planning is
different. You just live from day to day. You don't plan ahead.
   ``Babies having babies, illiteracy among parents, not having
jobs ... it's all here.''
   Such problems have paralyzed the Mississippi Delta region, which
includes parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee, many of them home to some of
America's poorest and most troubled schools.
   Mississippi has consistently ranked lowest in the nation on
standardized test scores. Kentucky ranks at the bottom in
percentage of high school graduates.
   Dickerson, the first black to run this 5,000-student rural
school district in southwestern Tenneessee, faces similar daunting
challenges.
   The dropout rate is 33 percent. More than one in four adults
can't read or write. Poverty is so pervasive that 86 percent of the
students qualify for free lunches.
   ``You have parents of these children who do not value education
very highly,'' the superintendent said. ``When their kids get
grown, they won't value education for their kids.''
   But for every problem, Dickerson has a program.
   For teen mothers, it's a day-care center and parenting class at
the high school. For adults, literacy and high school equivalency
diploma classes. For working parents, a plan to keep buildings open
12 hours a day. And for welfare mothers not in school, job training
and placement.
   Since taking over four years ago, Dickerson, whose district is
70 percent black, has added academic programs, seen some test
scores improve, opened a new school and closed three others that
``you would wonder if they were fit for hogs to live in.''
   Still, three of eight schools have no gyms. Classes have
staggered starting times because there aren't enough buses. Teacher
salaries are low, turnover is high. There aren't enough computers
or modern shop equipment.
   Money would be one solution, but Dickerson says his district
receives only two-thirds the dollars it needs. Annual per pupil
expenditures in 1988-89 were $2,729. The national average is
$4,770. His district and scores of others have sued the state of
Tennessee, contending its method of funding is inequitable and
unconstitutional.
   Across the Delta, history and racism have also contributed to
the misery.
   Emphasis was placed on getting the most out of the land, and
schooling interfered.
   ``Historically, there was a prohibition against education in the
South, particularly of the African-American population,'' said
Wilbur Hawkins, executive director of the Lower Mississippi Delta
Development Commission.
   ``What we're finding is the end result of many years of
neglect,'' he said.
   Last year, 17 Mississippi school districts were placed on
probation because of low test scores. The penalties were part of a
reform package typical of the states in the region since the early
1980s.
   Kentucky recently overhauled its entire school system after the
state Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional because of variances
in district-to-district spending. Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi
and Tennessee have passed reforms to address entrenched Delta
realities.
   According to the last census, for example, dropout rates in the
region averaged 25 percent, compared with 20 percent nationally,
and ran more than 40 percent in seven Delta counties.
   The census also found that 45 percent of Delta residents older
than 25, and six of 10 blacks in that group, never finished high
school.
   Some blame high dropout rates on the lack of jobs in the area;
there's little incentive to get a diploma because it won't mean
anything. Others point to poverty.
   ``It's easier to drop out if you don't have a good pair of shoes
to go to school with,'' said Huel Perkins, a member of Louisiana's
Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. ``It's easier to drop
out if you don't see light at the end of the tunnel.
   ``What you live in can be a deterrent to staying in school,'' he
said. ``You get up in squalor, one day you say, `What the heck, I'm
not going anymore.'''
   Although many private and public projects teach reading,
illiteracy runs high in many areas _ a third of Mississippi's
adults, for instance.
   This lack of basic skills, compounding a ``national perception
of the Delta as a social and political backwater,'' in the words of
the Delta commission, only makes it more difficult to attract
industry.
   Still, some signs are encouraging.
   While school desegregation in the mid-1960s led to white flight
and private academies, white students are trickling back to the
public schools in Fayette County, said Tom Morgan, chairman pro tem
of the school board.
   ``These people (are saying), `Hey, they've got a good system,'''
Morgan said.
   And some homegrown efforts to boost morale seem to be working.
   Ten years ago, the Rural Organizing and Cultural Center in
Holmes County, Miss., began a student essay contest on local black
history.
   ``They're becoming aware of things, and they feel like they can
do something about it,'' said the center's Ann Brown.
   Seventeen-year-old Michael Brown, a two-time contest winner,
wrote about the voting rights struggle a generation ago; one man he
interviewed told of being turned away by a registrar because he
didn't know how many seeds were in a watermelon.
   Brown's 63-page essay, written when he was 15, ends with a call
to action: ``There are people who died, went to jail, got beaten
up, marched and protested for blacks to have the right to vote, and
you should defend that right and go to the polls.''
   In the Delta, adolescent idealism often is displaced by a
don't-know, don't-care attitude, but Michael has a dream: to go
away to college, get a business degree and start a company.
   ``It will be here,'' he said. ``The unemployment rate,
especially among blacks, is horrible. And if anybody's going to do
it, it has to be my generation.''

   The Mississippi Delta is a rich, fertile land of
widespread poverty and pollution, both of which contribute to poor
health among many residents. This third part of a five-day AP Extra
series, ``Children of the Delta,'' examines health and
environmental issues in the Delta, which one expert compares to the
Third World and calls ``a national tragedy.''

   Signs with skulls and cross-bones are
posted now in Devil's Swamp, but nothing warned Barbara Dixon's
husband of the dangers when he hunted and fished there in 1986,
bringing home the bounty of this ``Sportsman's Paradise.''
   Mrs. Dixon loved the crawfish, the catfish and the rabbits, and
ate them all while pregnant.
   At age 3 weeks, her daughter began having seizures. Before her
first birthday, tiny Emily was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a rare
cancer on her spinal cord. Before her fourth birthday, she had
endured chemotherapy and three operations.
   But Emily Dixon is one of the luckier victims in what locals
call the ``cancer corridor'' for its concentration of chemical
companies. She survived, and is considered 90 percent cured.
   There's no doubt in her mother's mind the chemical companies are
to blame.
   ``It's easy to say they are ruining our water and doing this and
that and it's no big deal. But when you're ruining our children,
that's something else,'' Mrs. Dixon said.
   Across the Mississippi Delta region, which includes parts of
Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and
Tennessee, health and environmental problems are intertwined, and
troubles abound.
   They hit hardest, it seems, at those most vulnerable: the 3
million children of the Delta.
   Robert Lingafelter runs a Mississippi program called Partners
for Improved Nutrition and Health, which uses techniques developed
in the Third World to fight the Delta's sometimes Third World
conditions.
   He sees progress since the days, only 25 years ago, of
``Biafra-style malnutrition.'' And yet, ``in the face of what has
not yet been done,'' he said, ``the Delta's a national tragedy.''
   Death rates in many counties by the river are higher than the
national average. Along Louisiana's chemical-producing region,
cancer rates are higher than would normally be expected, though
scientists have yet to establish a direct cause.
   Poverty, teen-age motherhood and poor nutrition, along with
doctor and nursing shortages, exact a toll on health, exacerbated
by lax environmental laws and the heavy use of agricultural
pesticides and other chemicals.
   A January survey by the Washington-based Center for the Study of
Social Policy ranked Mississippi and Louisiana 50th and 51st
respectively on children's health.
   The United States has a national infant mortality rate of 10.7
per 1,000 live births; in the Delta, the rate is 12.5.
   For years, Humphreys County, Miss., has had one of the highest
infant mortality rates in the world _ higher than Malaysia, French
Guiana and other less-developed nations. Eight infants died in
1988, giving the county a rate of 33.2.
   ``We don't really know why,'' said Lou Anne McLendon, the
county's public health nurse, who runs a clinic offering prenatal
care and nutrition. But most of the mothers whose infants died did
not take advantage of the prenatal care offered, she said.
   One-third of the babies delivered last year were born to
teen-agers, including 59 to mothers 13 and 14 years old, according
to Dr. Alfio Rausa, a Greenwood, Miss., physician who oversees the
Delta district for the state health department.
   ``Part of it is lack of education. No hope, no recreation,''
Rausa said. ``The family structure has broken down.''
   Lake County, Tenn., population about 7,500, has only one doctor,
who runs a clinic and serves as director of the health department,
assistant director of the nursing home and county medical examiner.
   ``Should an emergency, such as cardiac arrest (or) multiple
trauma occur, the chances of survival in Lake County are
approximately zero,'' Dr. Renee Lamb said at a public hearing
before the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission.
   In many parts of the Delta, residents believe the polluted
environment is as much a culprit for their ills as inadequate care.
   They point to the dozens of sprawling, shiny plants tucked in
the swampy Delta amid moss-covered trees _ plants that spew
chemicals, including known carcinogens, into the air and water.
   Louisiana ranked 48th in an environmental health survey released
in April by the Durham, N.C.-based Institute for Southern Studies.
It was no surprise to those who live here.
   ``For decades the South, Louisiana, has taken its environment
for granted,'' Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer said. ``We had to hustle
so hard for jobs, people just gave up their environmental
considerations.''
   The Mississippi River not only provides drainage for two-thirds
of the nation, but also is a disposal route for tons of chemicals
and pollutants.
   The river carries 213 million pounds of toxic chemicals through
New Orleans each year, according to a two-year study by the
environmental group Greenpeace.
   Teresa Robert, who lives near the river in the middle of the
so-called ``cancer corridor,'' remembers swimming in the river as a
child almost 30 years ago.
   ``Now I would not think of sticking my foot in it,'' said Mrs.
Robert, who formed an environmental group that blocked a planned
waste dump in Ascension Parish. The parish already is home to three
of Louisiana's 11 ``Superfund'' sites targeted by the Environmental
Protection Agency for cleanup.
   Pharmacist Kay Gaudet in nearby St. Gabriel can chart her town's
health through the drugs she dispenses. In a nine-month period in
1986, Mrs. Gaudet discovered that the second most commonly
prescribed drug was for breast cancer. Only this year has that drug
made it into the top 200 drugs used nationwide.
   ``There's no question in my mind what causes it, but if you try
to find a smoking gun, it's going to be impossible,'' she said.
   The Louisiana Chemical Association, the trade group for the
state's largest industry, insists its products are not responsible
for the high cancer rates. Residents' penchant for spicy food, rich
living, smoking and other factors all play a part, the group says.
   Spokesman Richard Kleiner added, however, that the chemical
companies know they have ``a lot of problems of the past to
correct.''
   St. Jude's Hospital, an international center specializing in
children's cancer, ended up in Memphis, Tenn., in part because of
the health problems of the children of the region.
   Louisiana parents gather in support groups there and shake their
heads in disbelief at their numbers in the waiting rooms.
   But Dr. Elizabeth Thompson, St. Jude's physician-in-chief, said
researchers there, like others, have been unable to find a link
between the chemical discharges and the high incidence of cancer.
   Barbara Dixon says she doesn't need proof. She brings Emily to
testify in support of environmental bills, hoping lawmakers will
reverse concessions to the chemical industry and tighten pollution
controls.
   She says she doesn't want the plants to close because too many
people depend on the jobs.
   ``I want them to be responsible,'' Mrs. Dixon said. ``I want
them to stop saying the cost is too much to control our air quality
or our water quality.
   ``What is the cost of my child's life?''

<HEAD>PART IV: Delta Town Fights for Jobs _ `What Can You Offer Your

   The lush Mississippi Delta soil once provided
tens of thousands of jobs for its people, who knew no way of life
except on the land. But when machines replaced man decades ago,
work disappeared. Today, many agriculturally dependent towns are
trying to recruit new businesses and stem the migration of their
best and brightest. This fourth report in a five-day AP Extra
series, ``Children of the Delta,'' examines one such town.

<TEXT>
   The day Cleo Dunnings said goodbye to her
daughter, they both realized a bitter fact of life: the road to
success often leads one way _ straight out of this Delta town.
   With no job and no strong prospects, Donna Dunnings Sidney moved
north, following a route many of her peers have taken, packing
their skills, their dreams and part of this town's future.
   ``It's frustrating that a community I grew up in, that I lived
in, that was a part of me and my family, could not open doors to
me,'' said Mrs. Sidney, 25, an accounting graduate who left Helena
in 1987 for Chicago, where she works for the Cook County assessor.
   ``I felt if I could have stayed, I could have made things a
little better and right some wrongs.''
   ``It's very sad,'' said her mother, a city council member.
``We'll continue to lose them until we get something for them to
do.''
   This Mississippi River town typifies many communities in the
Delta region, which includes parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.
   It hungers for jobs to hold on to young folks, yearns for the
golden era when stores were open and streets were crowded, and
dreams of the day when prosperity will come back to stay.
   Helena ``pretty much reflects everything the Delta has been and
is _ both in promise and problems,'' said Ken Hubbell, director of
the Delta Cultural Center.
   It has the river but poverty, a legacy of strained race
relations but new efforts by blacks and whites to work together.
   The biggest prospect for the future is a $35 million slackwater
harbor and industrial park, partly financed by county residents who
recently approved a temporary 1-cent sales tax increase.
   ``It's a hope,'' said Rod Frazier, vice president of Quincy
Soybean Co. ``We don't really have much else to stake our hopes on
in this area.''
   The 2.9-mile-long harbor holds enormous potential: one study
estimates it could create 30,000 jobs within 15 years of completion
in 1993.
   And Helena has other big plans. The $8.5 million cultural
center, which will include a museum, performance stage and
archives, is being built in this land of cotton and home of the
blues.
   There's already a tourism draw: the King Biscuit Blues Festival,
which attracted 40,000 visitors last year, from as far as Sweden
and New Zealand.
   But while bringing in outsiders is important, so is keeping
insiders _ the next generation.
   ``You raise a family up and what can you offer to your kids?''
asked Jessie Blakely, a liquor store owner, surveying weed-filled
lots from his window.
   Two major forces contributed to Helena's troubles: the
post-World War II agricultural revolution when machines replaced
man, and the loss of three industries in the mid-'70s and early
'80s that employed more than 1,200 people.
   The result is a giant gap between haves and have-nots.
   ``The lack of a viable middle class is one of the problems of
this area,'' said L.T. Simes II, an attorney and radio station
owner who lives in adjacent West Helena. ``We have a lot of poor
people and a lot of rich people.''
   While there are stately Victorian mansions in this town of
9,500, around the downtown area about one of three stores is
closed. Windows are caked in dust, buildings are boarded up, and
the paint on a movie house that played its last picture show long
ago is chipped and peeling.
   Of about 34,700 Phillips County residents _ a 21 percent
population drop since 1960 _ more than 30 percent were on food
stamps in February.
   As in many Delta counties, there's great disparity between
whites and blacks, who make up 55 percent of the population. In the
last census, for example, the white poverty rate was 14.6 percent;
for blacks, it was 61.8 percent.
   A gap also exists in education. Some 25 percent to 30 percent of
county residents can't read or write. And though unemployment rates
have dropped, 1989's 13.2 percent county average was 2{ times the
national level. Blacks fared far worse than whites.
   For many, the advent of combines, tractors, the cotton
harvesting machine and pesticides was the beginning of the end _
eliminating, by the estimate of one U.S. Agriculture Department
demographer, the jobs of three-quarters of sharecropping families.
   According to a 1985 report, 75 percent of blacks working in the
Delta were directly involved in agriculture in 1950; in 1980, it
was 14 percent.
   Agriculture remains the dominant industry here and in other
Delta counties, but it takes fewer people and more sophistication.
   ``A combine's more than $120,000. ... It doesn't make sense to
put an illiterate person on that piece of machinery,'' said Bart
Lindsey, executive vice president of the First National Bank of
Phillips County. ``It's too big of an investment.''
   Other jobs have emerged in the Delta: cut-and-sew operations in
the Missouri Bootheel, vegetable production in Arkansas and
Tennessee, catfish farms and processing plants in Mississippi.
   ``It's been said in a number of circles nothing has changed from
the plantation era but the crop _ instead of cotton, it's the
catfish industry,'' said Wilbur Hawkins, executive director of the
Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission.
   ``We have replaced one low-paying job with another,'' said Larry
Farmer, president of Mississippi Action for Community Education.
``Most of the persons who work in these catfish plants are
low-skilled. It's a dead-end kind of job.''
   In Helena, some feel the priorities are confused _ education
should be improved first, so businesses will want to come here.
   If not, ``I don't care if you put 10 harbors or 10 anything here
... I have no hope at all,'' said Dr. Robert Miller, who grew up in
the area.
   But Blakely, the liquor store owner, thinks Helena's day is
coming.
   ``Anything worthwhile is worth waiting for,'' he said. ``There's
going to be a future. I think our town will come back.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ No one knows how many Americans are going
hungry. Some estimate as many as 20 million. Volunteers who helped
feed the poor in the emergency of the last recession are still at
work in a network of charitable soup kitchens and food banks,
trying to fill a void left by a cutback in governmental largess.
This is the first of two articles.

   Hunger is something America's come to live with.
   ``In the same way that we have a football season, we now have a
hunger season,'' says Nancy Amidei, a Washington, D.C., activist.
``It begins with World Hunger Day in October, and runs on through
Thanksgiving, with a big orgy of stories about feeding people huge
meals at Christmas time.''
   The season ends but hunger continues. And after eight years of
economic improvement, Americans who pitched in to help their
neighbors through an emergency now find themselves in a curious
position.
   In a nation of supermarkets and surpluses, they are forging
careers in food banks and soup kitchens.
   ``We used to show up for work in Birkenstocks and blue jeans.
Now we're talking pension plans and retirement and transferring
from one part of the country to another as food bankers,'' says
Catherine D'Amato, director of the Western Massachusetts Food Bank.
   No one knows how many Americans face chronic hunger. The
Harvard-based Physician Task Force on Hunger in America estimated
in 1985 that 20 million people were going hungry at least some days
of every month. A Louis Harris poll at about the same time
concluded that a minimum of 21 million people were going hungry.
   The federal government disputed both findings, but has released
no numbers of its own. The Food Resource and Action Center (FRAC),
the nation's leading hunger research and advocacy group, is
conducting a nationwide study of childhood hunger. Based on its
findings to date, FRAC believes that 8 million to 9 million
children are either hungry or at risk of going hungry.
   Even though America has a well-developed system for carrying
food from farms to markets, the 1980s saw a grass-roots anti-hunger
effort develop into a second distribution network. By conservative
estimates, more than 20,000 food banks, soup kitchens, food
pantries, church groups, community action programs and civic
organizations have helped deliver food since 1982.
   In an era of lower wages, higher housing costs and shrinking
public programs, there's no doubt that private, non-profit food
programs have become lifelines for many people.
   But for some advocates, the crisis-driven effort of the '80s is
giving way to new doubts in the '90s about whether ``emergency''
services that now seem all too permanent are really an answer.
   To many Americans, soup kitchens are reassuring evidence of the
nation's humanity, proof that the private sector _ the ``thousand
points of light'' _ is willing to shoulder its share of the burden.
   Such programs intercept millions of pounds of food that would
otherwise be wasted and make it available to people who need it. In
the process, they focus attention on hunger and provide people a
means of addressing it, as donors, fund-raisers or volunteers.
   In some cases, informal private programs offer more humane
treatment than bureaucratic public programs. For those on society's
fringes, the programs provide social contact along with meals or
groceries. They also bring together people who might otherwise fall
through gaps in the government's safety net, making it possible for
social scientists to document the extent of the problem. ``Federal
programs are designed to be of great assistance, but government
cannot do it all,'' says Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., the ranking
minority member of the House Agriculture subcommittee on nutrition
and a champion of private-sector initiatives.
   ``There are those who argue government ought to do it all. I
think it should do what it needs to do, what it can do.''
   Total spending on food assistance makes up about 2 percent of
the federal budget, according to FRAC.
   Congress is considering spending an additional $2.3 billion for
food programs over the next three years. The Mickey Leland Memorial
Domestic Hunger Relief Act, named for the Texas congressman who
died while investigating hunger in Ethiopia last year, is the
largest anti-hunger initiative since 1977.

   The following is a glossary of terms commonly used to refer to
non-profit agencies, private initiatives and government programs
related to hunger relief:
   FOOD BANKS are non-profit community organizations that collect
surplus commodities from the government and edible but often
unmarketable foods from private industry for use by non-profit
charities, institutions and feeding programs at nominal cost.
   SECOND HARVEST is a national food banking network to which the
majority of food banks belong. Its 200 member food banks comprise
the largest charitable feeding program in the nation.
   SOUP KITCHENS are small feeding operations attached to existing
organizations such as churches, civic groups or non-profit agencies
that serve prepared meals that are consumed on-site. Soup kitchens
generally do not require clients to prove need or show
identification.
   FOOD PANTRIES, usually attached to existing non-profit agencies,
distribute bags or boxes of groceries to people experiencing food
emergencies. Foods distributed by pantries are prepared and
consumed elsewhere. Referrals or proof of need are often required.
There are roughly two food pantries to every soup kitchen.
   TEMPORARY EMERGENCY FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (TEFAP) is a program
that transfers surplus government commodities to states and
localities for distribution by non-profit agencies to the needy.
   FOOD STAMPS are the government's premier nutrition program,
reaching 19 million Americans a month, half of them children.
Unlike private, emergency programs, food stamps enable recipients
to buy food in supermarkets. Food stamp benefits average 57 cents
per person per meal, with a maximum benefit of about 90 cents. Food
stamps are an entitlement program, meaning everyone who meets
eligibility requirements is entitled to participate. But recent
studies indicate only 40 to 60 percent of those who are eligible
actually participate in the program.
   WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) is a federal program that
provides nutritious supplements to pregnant and postpartum women,
infants and children up to age 5. Studies have shown WIC to be an
effective program in preventing low birthweight and infant
mortality, and in encouraging low-income women to receive prenatal
care. WIC is not an entitlement program. Only about half of those
eligible are being served, primarily due to inadequate funding.

   Here are some highlights of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic
Hunger Relief Act, HR 4110, the largest anti-hunger initiative
since 1977. As introduced in the House, the bill would:
   _Increase benefits for the Food Stamp Program and the Temporary
Emergency Food Assistance Program by $600 million in fiscal 1991
and $2.3 billion over the next three years.
   _Provide a 2 percent across-the-board increase in food stamp
benefit levels, in addition to inflation.
   _Provide higher food stamp benefit levels for families whose
housing costs exceed 50 percent of their incomes, the group at
highest risk of homelessness.
   _Raise the fair market value of vehicles food stamp recipients
can own from the current $4,500 set in 1977 to $5,500 in fiscal
1991, and adjust for inflation thereafter.
   _Allow relatives who buy and cook food separately to be
considered separate food stamp households, with the exception of
minor children living with their parents. Current law requires
people to apply together with parents, siblings and adult children,
thereby discouraging doubling up with relatives.
   _Exclude the first $50 monthly child support payment from
consideration as income in determining food stamp benefits. The
Food Stamp Program currently counts these payments as income, which
lowers benefits and discourages custodial parents from seeking
child support.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It all began in another century, when the
delicacy of the East met the chutzpah of the West. Japan wanted
mainly to be left alone until the United States started
interfering. Then Uncle Sam after World War II set about rebuilding
a country it had helped to crush, a country that now has become its
strongest economic competitor. It's a story of ironies.

   On July 8, 1853, Americans went calling on the Japanese who had
sealed themselves off from the world for centuries. They weren't
glad to see us.
   On Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese came calling on Americans. We
weren't at all glad to see them.
   In 1947, six years after the attack on Pearl Harbor, a group of
American businessmen went to Tokyo at the behest of their
government to see if Japan's devastated economy could be brought to
life. They found ways.
   Now in 1990, hat in hand, American officials confer anxiously
with the Japanese once again in the hope of persuading them to open
their gates.
   It has been, you might say, a strange relationship, a classic
study in irony.
   It was the United States that ``opened'' Japan and brought it
into the global marketplace in 1853. Until then, for two and a half
centuries, the country was so fiercely private that foreign sailors
shipwrecked on its shores weren't allowed to leave and Japanese
sailors thrown up on foreign shores weren't allowed to come home.
   Today, little, shy, remote, reclusive Japan is, resoundingly, no
longer any of the above. Japanese investors are as ubiquitous as
Japanese tourists; they are into everything from the skating rink
at Rockefeller Center in New York to the Sistine Chapel in the
Vatican.
   Today, 137 years after an American sailor persuaded them to
trade, the Japanese sell $49 billion more of their products in the
United States than the United States sells in Japan. Today Japan
joins the United States in having the two largest economies in the
world and in sharing one-third of the world's total output of goods
and services.
   This munificence began in a remarkable comic opera in which the
fragile delicacy of the East was introduced to the chutzpah of the
West.
   On that day in 1853, Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry sailed up
Tokyo Bay in four black warships belching black smoke. The Japanese
had never seen steamers before. They thought these were ``floating
volcanoes.''
   Local officials came aboard to tell the intruders to state their
business and be gone. Perry said he would talk to no one of minor
rank. A vice governor came out. Perry wouldn't see him. The
governor came and Perry let it be known, through subordinates, that
he would meet with a Japanese prince ashore to transmit a letter
from President Millard Fillmore to the Emperor of Japan and, unless
it was delivered, the United States of America would be gravely
insulted.
   Agreed. But not without ceremony. The Japanese built a pavilion
festooned with beautiful silks to receive the letter. They lined
the shore with 5,000 soldiers. And then, flanked by two armed,
gigantic blacks, Perry landed with 100 sailors, 100 Marines and
three ships' bands playing ``Hail Columbia.''
   With bows all around, he delivered the letter, which was
inscribed on vellum, bound in blue velvet, sealed in a rosewood box
trimmed in gold and signed by ``your good friend, Millard
Fillmore,'' who apparently made friends easily. Perry said he would
be back next year for the emperor's answer and sailed off.
   Back he came on Feb. 11, 1854, this time with seven ships and
gifts of sets of freshly invented telegraph instruments, a
quarter-size steam locomotive capable of 20 mph and complete with
cars and tracks, four volumes of Audubon's ``Birds of America,'' an
assortment of farm tools and guns, a barrel of whiskey and several
cases of champagne.
   Thus was the East won. The emperor signed a treaty agreeing to
limited trade, the safe return of shipwrecked American sailors and
the use of two ports as coal stations. Japan had joined the world.
   Having fought foreign influences, it now embraced them. It sent
students, bureaucrats and businessmen abroad to learn from the West
and imported Western teachers at high salaries to teach its young.
It erected factories, encouraged foreign trade and built a strong
army and navy.

   And soon Japan, which for centuries wouldn't risk life beyond
its own islands, now decided it couldn't survive on them alone. It
reached out for markets and raw materials the way the West did and
with two wars only 10 years apart, against China and Russia, it
carved an empire on the mainland of Asia.
   With 61 other countries, it renounced war as an instrument of
national policy in 1928 and three years later renounced the
renouncement. It marched again in China and Manchuria in the hunt
for new markets and fodder for its growing war machine.
   Finally, its strategists concluded, only one obstacle stood
between Japan and the rubber of Indochina, the bauxite and tin of
Malaya and Burma and the oil of the Dutch East Indies. And so the
former recluse and pupil charged through the door Perry had opened
and attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor while its
negotiators talked peace in Washington.
   The war it thus started cost Japan 1,972,000 lives, military and
civilian, and killed 98,211 Americans. It brought Japan the shame
of its first surrender to a foreign invader _ Douglas MacArthur
riding through Tokyo on a road lined with 30,000 Japanese soldiers,
their backs to the conqueror in a mark of respect usually reserved
for the emperor.
   It was a war that cost Japan dearly but also, in the perverse
way of history to come, rewarded the loser. It brought Japan
democracy in a constitution written by Americans in three weeks, a
document that renounced war and included an article guaranteeing
equal rights to women, which Americans have yet to see in their own
Constitution.
   In the immediate postwar years, it was Uncle Sam who fed Japan
and brought a rebirth of its smoldering industry with dollars and
direction. It was a group of American businessmen headed by Joseph
Dodge, a banker from Detroit _ yes, Detroit _ who told the Japanese
they had to cut inflation, build exports, limit domestic
consumption, put a lid on wages, improve productivity and close
plants that couldn't compete.
   It was the constitution written by Americans that denied Japan
an army, navy and air force and freed its economy to grow
unfettered by military costs. It was American bombs that flattened
Japanese factories and made totally new ones inevitable, which
brought new technology and new efficiency unmatched by the old
plants in Detroit and Gary, Ind. Finally, it was the war in Korea
that brought Japan more billions as a base and supplier.
   Little or none of this can be credited to Uncle Sam's big heart.
His interest lay with a strong, stable Japan on his side of the
Cold War.
   And there Japan remained while its economy grew at twice the
speed of Uncle's and produced and sold more automobiles, more ships
and more television sets than any country in the world, including
the homeland of Henry Ford.
   For a country that once wanted to live alone and be left alone,
Japan has proven spectacularly gregarious. The global reach of its
investors now promises to replace the British Empire in the old
cliche about where the sun never sets.
   Sony buys Columbia Pictures; Mitsubishi is getting cozy with
Daimler-Benz and bringing together the descendants of the folks who
used to build Japanese fighters and German tanks; Japanese money is
showing up in the shadows of 7-Eleven stores; Nippon Television
Network pays for the restoration of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel
in exchange for exclusive film and TV rights; Japanese investors
help finance Donald Trump's ``Taj Mahal'' in Atlantic City;
Japanese tourists line up solemnly to see the sunken battleships at
the Pearl Harbor memorial while others play golf on courses owned
by the Japanese in Hawaii.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Thousands of Haitians toil in the sugar cane
fields of the Dominican Republic under conditions compared to
slavery by some human rights activists. Even a report commissioned

   From dawn to dusk
under a fierce tropical sun, imported Haitian workers hack sugar
cane with machetes and load it into wagons pulled by gaunt oxen
leaning into wooden yokes.
   Horsemen with shotguns and pistols patrol the dusty lanes.
Soldiers guard bridges and crossroads, watching for runaways.
   The ``braceros,'' or laborers, and their families live in tiny
shacks in the ``bateys,'' the squalid compounds on the
government-run plantations, most without running water or
electricity. They have little to eat.
   A report by three human rights groups in October compared the
plight of the Haitian braceros to slavery, saying they are being
held on the Dominican plantations at gunpoint.
   ``Like their ancestors brought from Africa, they are forced to
labor against their will, cutting sugar cane for armed Dominican
masters,'' said the report commissioned by Americas Watch,
Caribbean Rights and the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees.
   Manuel de Jesus Vinas Caceres, director of the State Sugar
Council, which administers the government-run plantations, rejects
comparisons of the cane cutters to slaves. He contends they are no
worse off than farm laborers elsewhere in Latin America.
   ``It is a drama of poverty present in all the rural zones of
Latin America,'' he says.
   ``We have to improve things, I agree.''
   An independent study commissioned by the State Sugar Council,
published in 1986 as a 636-page book titled ``El Batey,'' said the
cane cutters live in ``absolute poverty under one of the most
oppressive systems one can imagine ... Many of the workers don't
even eat once a day.''
   The State Sugar Council is an autonomous government bureaucracy
that administers 279,000 acres yielding 60 percent of the country's
sugar.
   One-quarter of Dominican workers are unemployed, but they shun
the back-breaking labor of cutting cane, which pays only an average
of $2.35 a day for harvesting 1.5 tons.
   So sugar plantations recruit about 40,000 workers each year from
Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with the Dominican
Republic and is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere.
   Many of the workers are brought across the border by recruiters
who are paid $2.50 a head. Since many of the Haitians are in the
country illegally, they have few rights.
   Recruits, known as ``congos,'' live in tiny huts or in rooms 12
feet square in long concrete barracks resembling stables, with no
kitchens, stoves, bathrooms or running water. As many as 10 to 14
men sleep in each room.
   Veteran Haitian workers, called ``viejos,'' are crammed with
their families into one-room shacks or huts.
   Haitian workers may leave the plantations at the end of the
harvest season, which runs from November to May.
   Conditions are better at Central Romana, a private U.S.-owned
operation of 140,845 acres that is the world's largest sugar
plantation.
   Housing is about the same, but Central Romana provides its
workers with schools, medical care, running water, and subsidized
beef, chicken and vegetables.
   For decades, the Dominican Republic contracted for 15,000
workers a year by paying $2 million to the Haitian government. The
arrangement began in 1952 and ended with the fall of the Duvalier
dictatorship in Haiti in 1986.
   ``If you are going to blame anyone, you have to blame both sides
for the quasi-slave trade,'' says Anglican Bishop Telesforo A.
Isaac, who grew up on a sugar plantation. He said payments are made
on both sides of the border to smooth the way for importation of
the Haitians.

   The contract signed by the Sugar Council and the Haitian
government theoretically provided for the welfare of the workers:
adequate housing, electricity, running water, sanitary facilities,
dining areas, eight-hour workdays.
   ``Unfortunately, most terms of the contract were never
enforced,'' said the October human rights report.
   Since the fall of the Duvalier regime in 1986, Haitians who are
recruited to the plantations lack even the hypothetical protection
of a contract.
   ``Haitians in the Dominican Republic are compelled to work on
sugar plantations by physical force and by threats of
deportation,'' the October human rights report said. It said
workers were often locked in their barracks at night, braceros who
refused to cut cane were sometimes beaten or jailed, and
undocumented Haitians living elsewhere in the Dominican Republic
were rounded up by the Army and forced to work on the plantations.
   Dominican historian Frank Moya Pons, director of the study
commissioned by the Sugar Council, said recommendations on how
conditions could be improved were first presented to the council in
1984.
   ``It is my impression that conditions have worsened in the years
since the report was presented,'' said Moya Pons, who now teaches
at the University of Florida.
   Haiti and the Dominican Republic are negotiating a new contract
calling for 28,000 braceros who would be given individual work
contracts providing for decent living and working conditions.
   Vinas Caceres of the State Sugar Council says he wants a
contract with Haiti that would guarantee ``humane, just treatment.''
   ``I'm taking action against anyone who mistreats the workers,''
he says, slapping his desk for emphasis.
   As an example, Vinas Caceras says he had ordered the dismissal
of a supervisor at the Haina plantation who was accused of forcing
Haitians to leave church on Sunday to cut cane.
   A reporter who visited the plantation, however, found that the
supervisor, Fernando Sanchez, was still on the job and had locked
up five Haitians.
   Interviewed through the bars of a window, the men said they had
eaten only bread and sugar for three days. They said they lived in
the town of Boca Chica and were returning from a visit to Haiti
when a Haina Plantation bus picked them up and delivered them to
Sanchez.
   Mercedes Reyes, the plantation superintendent, said the Haitians
might be thieves or drug runners and would be turned over to the
police. He said Sanchez was an exemplary employee and there was no
reason to transfer him for forcing people to work on Sunday.
   ``The harvest comes first,'' Reyes declares. ``Here, everyone
works seven days a week, including me.''
   Dominican churches try to assist Haitians with windmills, water
pumps, latrines and vegetable gardens. A group called Pastoral
Haitiana provides medical and legal aid.
   ``We have repatriated 31 juveniles and 41 men and women so far
this season who were either underage, sick or had been tricked or
forced to work against their will,'' says the Rev. Edwin Paraison,
an Anglican priest who runs Pastoral Haitiana with three other
priests.
   Driving down a dusty trail deep in the Consuelo plantation on
the southwest coast, Paraison braked to pick up a boy who appeared
to be an underage worker. He gave his name as Arnold Petion, and
said he was 16 and had been in the Dominican Republic only seven
days.
   Later, seated in a church office in the same school uniform he
wore when he left Haiti, the boy said a recruiter promised a soft
job with good pay.
   ``When I arrived,'' he said, ``the old-timers told me I had been
sold, along with everyone else here.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are the ``mole people,'' living underground
in a railroad tunnel, foraging Manhattan's garbage cans for food.
Robert Negron and Bernard Monte Isaac wouldn't have it any other
way. Life on the surface just didn't work out for them.

   In an underground railroad tunnel the width of a
football field, in a place so scary that Amtrak workers once were
assigned shotgun-toting escorts, about 40 homeless people are
making a life.
   To the sound of automobiles rumbling overhead, Robert Negron and
Bernard Monte Isaac emerge from the abandoned railroad shacks in
which they sleep.
   They stand near a campfire where they cook and boil water to
wash and clean clothes. They seem almost like bedraggled Boy Scouts
until they start talking about life in ``The Tunnel.''
   Some call it the ``Tunnel of Doom,'' its inhabitants the ``mole
people.''
   ``A lot of people are intrigued by our existence down here,''
Isaac says. ``What's so amazing? What are we supposed to do, come
down here to die?
   ``This is the perfect environment for one to grow in.''
   Negron, 38, and Isaac, 36, have chiseled out an existence in the
tunnel that stretches from 72nd Street to 125th Street along
Riverside Park on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
   They read by candlelight and occasionally cook gourmet meals.
The tunnel walls are adorned with murals.
   But they also struggle to survive amid violence. Isaac once
found a body in the tunnel, and a woman who lived near his shack
was raped.
   Underground trolls once demanded that Isaac pay them tribute to
pass through their territory. He reacted violently. He was the Lord
of the Tunnel, he shouted, and they backed off. He has held that
title ever since.
   ``One will either grow or retard, there's no middle of the road.
It's a very dangerous place,'' says Isaac, who holds a
second-degree black belt in karate. ``This tunnel scares the hell
out of the macho-est of men.''
   Amtrak worker Bill Maccioli says he and other workers were so
frightened when they first entered the two-track tunnel in 1987
that railroad police carrying shotguns were sent along with them
for eight months.
   The tunnel connected now-abandoned rail yards west of Lincoln
Center to the New York Central tracks north along the Hudson River.
It has not been used for eight years. Amtrak plans to resume
service on the tracks soon, but the railroad will have to contend
with the estimated 30 to 50 people who live there.
   They are there by choice. All had lives above ground. Isaac
claims he has a degree in journalism from the University of
Maryland, and Negron says he lived on Staten Island with his wife
and 16-year-old son.
   ``It always seemed like no matter what I got into I wasn't
comfortable there,'' Negron says. ``My emotions always got
involved. I felt shy or guilty.''
   Negron, a former drug addict, was among the first to seek refuge
in the tunnel in the early 1980s. In the beginning, he was scared
and ashamed.
   ``When people were on the tracks, I would put out the candles
and would wait for them to leave...,'' he says. ``It's like living
in a men's shelter. When you go to sleep at night you have to tie
your shoes with knots so that when you wake up in the morning you
still have them.''
   When someone set his cubbyhole on fire, he moved about 20 blocks
uptown, met Isaac and resettled in a 10-by-20-foot shack that he
keeps padlocked.
   There is a bed, a refrigerator to store food at room
temperature, chest of drawers, food locker, a hamper, clothing on
hangers, a rug, candles and a suitcase.
   ``My happiest moment is when I go inside the room, light the
candle and sit down and read,'' Negron says.
   For Isaac, too, the happiest moments come when he has a full
stomach and climbs ``under the sheets nice and warm and tucked in
and dream. I'm at peace with myself and there's no knock at my
door.''
   He says he passes the time by working on a book, writing songs
and planning a documentary that he claims a European television
station is interested in. ``I'm a dreamer,'' Isaac says.
   Isaac and Negron redeem cans and bottles for the cash they need
and hunt through garbage cans for food scraps. On a recent haul,
Isaac came back with 127 unopened cans of food he found thrown away
by a supermarket.
   ``I'm not really in no pain,'' Negron says. ``I get what I need
and I'm satisfied. I just walk down the streets and I find what I
need.''
   ``You actually can exist from the waste of man and it's probably
one of the few cities you can get away with that in,'' Isaac says.
``We eat as we choose down here. We live as well if not better than
the average people up top.''
   They note that they are literally surrounded by art _ murals
created by artists like Chris Pape. Pape, who is not homeless, says
art is ``kind of neat when it's tucked away like that and you kind
of stumble upon it.''
   A painting of Mona Lisa lights up when sunlight streaks through
grates above. Other portraits feature Ted Williams, Woody Guthrie,
Michelangelo's ``David,'' Robert Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. and a break dancer.
   Negron has all of this, and liquor, too.
   ``I've got me and my bottle, the best company I have,'' he says.
``At least now I have a lot more peace of mind. I don't have no
anger in me to strike back at anybody. I don't blame anybody for
anything.''
   Is Isaac envious of the rest of the world?
   ``I've had the opportunity to get jobs,'' he says. ``I don't
choose to be a robot within the system. There's not enough money
they could pay me to become another person every day. What's
important is when I look in the mirror, I like who I see.
   ``We've done something that one out of every 1,000 men in
creation in their lifetimes will do. We dared to be ourselves.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The AIDS scare probably has a lot to do with it,
and religious training certainly does, but there are a lot of
people out there just saying no to sex before marriage. Now there's
a support group for them, the National Chastity Association,
founded by a divorced mother of two.

   The sexual revolution has spawned a group of
counter-revolutionaries, adults committed to celibacy before
marriage.
   Bucking societal trends, more than 400 men and women of varied
ages and backgrounds have found a haven in the National Chastity
Association.
   Some members have never had sex, but others have been married.
Many say they didn't join for any religious or moral reasons _
they're just fed up with the singles' bar scene and empty
relationships.
   Many admit they've had a difficult time convincing others they
are not weirdos.
   ``I've been humiliated, ridiculed, laughed at, made fun of,''
says Jance Hodge, a 30-year-old from Holbrook, Mass., who has never
dated and believes in premarital chastity because, ``It was the way
my mother brought us up.''
   When she heard about the group, ``I was totally psyched because
I was saying to myself, there are finally other virgins out there
besides me.''
   Elaine Marsh, a 35-year-old legal secretary from Orange County
near Los Angeles, found her new husband through the group.
   They began corresponding in November and first decided to get
married this May. But impatience intervened and they eloped on
March 30, one day after they had met each other in person for the
first time.
   ``When you can't do certain things before you get married, you
want to hurry up,'' Ms. Marsh says.
   She says neither was disappointed.
   ``We're discovering more and more things in common,'' she says.
``It's great.''
   Ms. Marsh had been single since her divorce six years ago. Three
years ago, she became celibate.
   ``It comes from my religion, but it's more than that,'' she
says. ``I just feel it's such a precious part of yourself, you
don't give it to someone when you haven't made the commitment of
marriage.''
   The decision wasn't an easy one.
   ``I had friends try and talk me out of it,'' she says. ``I had a
man say to me, `Why should I spend money on you if you're not going
to have sex with me, because 99 out of 100 women will?'''
   The pressure became too much to handle.
   ``I stopped dating, it was that difficult,'' she says. ``I got
tired of wrestling matches basically, so I just said forget this.''
   She joined the chastity association last June.
   ``I was really glad to see that there was actually a group that
has the same outlook that I have,'' she says. ``That's pretty hard
to find in Southern California.''
   Experts say there's no evidence of any major national trend
toward chastity, but concede the AIDS scare has made many some
singles shy away from intercourse.
   The National Chastity Association, a non-religious group,
founded less than two years ago by a divorced suburban mother of
two, functions as a kind of dating service and support group.
   Mary Meyer, 37, says she formed the group after suffering too
many heartaches from bad non-platonic relationships. She tried
joining a singles club and placing personal ads in local
newspapers, but failed to meet a man who shared her values.
   ``I love hand-holding, I love kissing, I love caressing, I love
sex,'' she says. ``But even more than I would love to experience
these things right now, I want to be able to have a relationship
where I can experience them forever.''
   Convinced that the best way to find an ideal mate is to build a
non-physical relationship before marriage, Ms. Meyer formed the
group based on what she calls the ``19 desires.''
   They include the desire to save hand-holding, kissing and sex
until marriage and to be close friends with someone for at least
two years before considering marriage.
   Members pay $15 a year, and get their names published in a group
directory that lists brief descriptions of members and their values.
   Lorraine Althea, a model in her 30s from Los Angeles, joined
about a year ago.
   ``I have fooled around a lot but I just reached a point where
I'd had enough, and I just wanted something more,'' she says. ``It
gets to the point of being boring. Men are after you all the time.''
   Fear of AIDS had something to do with her decision, but more
than that, Althea says, she ``was just tired of that shallow
feeling.''
   Since joining, Althea says she's met lots of celibate people.
   ``You begin to feel like you're the only one, but you're not,''
she said. ``We're not prudes. We've been around.''
   David Dismore, 43, a video archivist for feminist groups in
Southern California, says chastity is the sexual revolution's
forgotten ingredient.
   ``Some people think liberation means glorification of casual
sex,'' he says. ``I think the definition of sexual liberation is
the right to freely and comfortably say `no.'''
   Clergyman Joe Leonard of Wayne, Pa., who is involved in a
project on human sexuality for the National Council of Churches in
Christ, says he sees no trend toward chastity.
   ``I don't see any evidence of it, frankly,'' despite the
National Chastity Association, he says.
   Neither does Jerome Sherman, a Houston psychologist and
president of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors
and Therapists.
   ``We don't find that more people are saying no to sexual
activity,'' Sherman says.
   ``The question is not should you have any sexual activity before
marriage, because it depends on each individual.''
   In other words, to each his own.

commitment outside of marriage, including ``living together.''
   4. To marry someone who will be ``in love'' with you throughout
life.
   5. To marry someone who will be your best friend.

while single.
   17. To be very close friends with someone for at least two years
before even wanting to marry him or her.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The ``boot camp'' approach to disciplining young
criminals may be no more effective than conventional incarceration,
some studies suggest. But in Michigan prison officials are pleased
with the results of its two-year-old Camp Sauble program and the
state plans to build even more boot camps, including one for women.
Here's a look inside Camp Sauble.

   Gary Simmons, a 19-year-old, cocky high
school dropout with a long criminal record, quakes like a
frightened child as prison guards scream insults in his ear.
   ``Here, your first name is probationer,'' barks Sgt. Randy Winn.
``You're losing everything now, all that street crap.''
   Welcome to Camp Sauble, Michigan's ``boot camp'' prison.
   Simmons, convicted of breaking and entering, and two other young
criminals who have just arrived are standing with their noses
pressed hard against a white concrete-block wall, surrounded by
eight correctional officers all yelling at once.
   An hour-long tongue-lashing by guards in wide-brimmed hats and
shiny boots begins the moment the youths arrive from the county
jail.
   Inspector William Ray, pacing before the group with his hands
clinched behind his back, speaks calmly but sternly.
   ``I don't care how big and bad you think you are,'' he says.
``We think of you as nothing but puke.''
   Minutes later, the probationers' heads are shaved. They are
forced to clean their own hair off the floor as the yelling
continues.
   It's been two years since the first group of young men arrived
at Camp Sauble for 90 days of ``shock incarceration,'' a mix of
discipline, hard labor, education and intimidation.
   About 1,150 men between the ages of 17 and 25, almost all of
them multiple felony offenders and sentenced to at least a year in
prison, have volunteered for the probation program with a referral
by a judge or court officer. About 750, or 65 percent, have
graduated. The rest wind up in conventional prisons after being
kicked out or quitting. Some don't even make it through the first
day.
   ``They scared me so bad at intake, I never thought I'd make
it,'' says Christopher Brown, 18, of Detroit, who graduated March
30 after serving a sentence for cocaine possession.
   ``It's been a long, hard three months, but this program has
given me self-control and discipline and taught me how to respect
other people.''
   To the visitor, Camp Sauble presents a convincing argument for
the paramilitary approach, for shaking up prison-bound youths and
giving them a chance to straighten out their lives.
   But as Michigan begins to build more boot camp prisons, studies
suggest such programs may not be turning troubled lives around any
more than prison sentences.
   Michigan Department of Corrections officials boasted a
90-percent success rate for Camp Sauble after the first year of
operation, compared with 70 percent of state prison parolees who
stayed out of trouble. The Camp Sauble parolees were watched for
six to eight months. The average length of parole for a state
prison inmate is two years.
   A follow-up study of Camp Sauble's success is in the works.
   But longer-term studies of similar programs in other states show
boot-camp graduates wind up back in prison at roughly the same rate
as those paroled from the general prison population.
   ``If a drop in the recidivism rate is the main thing we want
from these programs, then they may not be working,'' says Doris
MacKenzie, a Louisiana State University professor studying the
programs in seven states for the National Institute of Justice.
   About 12 states have prison boot camp programs and dozens more
are considering them.
   ``Once the youth gets back to the community and his old friends,
there are all the same pressures that were there before _ the
drugs, the alcohol _ and that draws them back,'' MacKenzie says.
   No one argues, however, about cost-effectiveness.
   In Michigan, it costs about $4,000 to keep a probationer in the
three-month boot camp program, compared with about $22,000 to house
a state prison inmate for a year.
   In addition to doubling Camp Sauble's capacity from 120 to 240
beds by fall, the state is building another camp at Cassidy Lake in
Chelsea and one in Schoolcraft County in the Upper Peninsula. Also
there are plans to build one for women.
   The program is being expanded from 90 to 120 days, adding a
four-week ``decompression'' period emphasizing education over
physical labor. The probationer will still be under strict
discipline but will receive instruction in such things as job
hunting and parenting skills to ease the adjustment back into the
community.
   ``We have to make sure they're strong enough mentally as well as
physically to resist the peer pressure when they get back,'' says
Deputy Warden Bruce Curtis. ``They have to have enough self-esteem,
enough self-control to resist the drug pushers waving money at
them.''
   Self-control is tested daily at Camp Sauble, located in the
Manistee National Forest near Ludington. Probationers begin their
17-hour day at 5 a.m., awakened by the sounds of trash-can lids
clanging together like cymbals.
   In addition to two hours of rigorous physical training, the day
is filled with hard labor. A recent project involved pulling out
tree stumps and smoothing a runway at the Manistee Airport _ by
hand.
   Through it all, the probationer speaks only when spoken to. And
the only acceptable reply to a guard is ``Yessir!''
   Meals are eaten in silence. There is one hour of free time
daily, but the only television viewing permitted is the evening
news. There are no visitors and only weekly telephone calls.
   It is attention to detail _ the twice-daily inspections of
everything from the probationer's foot locker to his fingernails _
that makes the program tougher than others, Curtis says.
   Some criminal justice experts are skeptical that three or four
months of hard work and humiliation can undo a lifetime of neglect
or abuse.
   Michigan State University Professor Merry Morash says the
programs promote aggressive behavior and ignore the roots of
criminal behavior, such as unemployment.
   ``To try to treat this problem with a program that contains
elements of forced labor and early wake-up calls seems naive at
best,'' she testified at a recent federal hearing on the programs.
   But Curtis is convinced the program, through its toughness, is
the first evidence many of these youths have that someone cares _
the first step toward building self-esteem.
   ``We don't expect to change the person, but we can change their
desire,'' Curtis says. ``We can change his desires so he respects
authority and wants to accomplish something.''

   Writer Dominick Dunne spends his life rubbing
elbows with the rich and powerful and telling their secrets _ and
his own _ to the world.
   His novel, ``People Like Us,'' which has been adapted as a
two-part TV miniseries on NBC, looks at affluent people publicly
flaunting their wealth early in the past decade. It also serves as
a means for him to deal with his own desire for revenge for the
murder of his daughter.
   An earlier novel, ``The Two Mrs. Grenvilles,'' was an NBC
miniseries in 1987. His newest book, ``An Inconvenient Woman,'' is
due to be published this month.
   ``The parts in `People Like Us' that deal with my own life
involve Gus Bailey and Peach, his wife,'' says Dunne. ``That's
taken from my own life, and it's emphasized more in the miniseries
than in the book. The part that deals with New York society has
composite characters for libel reasons.''
   His daughter, actress Dominique Dunne, was killed by her former
boyfriend in Los Angeles in 1982 shortly after she had completed
her first movie, ``Poltergeist.'' The former boyfriend accused of
strangling her was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and was
released from prison after 6{ years.
   In ``People Like Us,'' which will be televised Sunday and
Monday, Gus Bailey goes to a prison hearing for his daughter's
convicted killer and shoots the man.
   ``I've never shot anybody,'' Dunne says. ``Let me explain that.
If you go through what I went through, losing my daughter, you have
strong, strong feelings of revenge. If you're an intelligent person
you know you can't seek revenge in that way.
   ``But as a novelist I could create a situation in which I could
do in the book what I couldn't do in real life. I intended for Gus
to kill the guy. But when I got to that part I couldn't write it.
He wounds him and goes to prison himself for a couple of years.''
   Dunne says writing the book helped him deal with his own
feelings about his daughter's killing. He is on the board of the
National Victims Association, which he says is working to gain
rights for victims equal to those of the accused killers.
   Dunne is also a contributing editor of Vanity Fair, an
arrangement that began when the magazine's editor, Tina Brown,
encouraged him to keep a journal during the trial of his daughter's
killer. That was published in the April 1983 issue and became the
first chapter in a collection of his Vanity Fair pieces called
``Fatal Charms.''
   The ``People Like Us'' miniseries stars Ben Gazarra as Gus
Bailey and Jean Simmons as Peach, plus Connie Sellecca, Eva Marie
Saint, Dennis Farina, Teri Polo, Beatrice Straight, Paul Williams
and Gary Frank.
   ``I was trying to make a comment on that period during the
Reagan years when the rich went so public and flaunted their
money,'' Dunne says. ``It was a pretty disgusting period. It was
fascinating to watch, but you have to say, `What's going on here?'
People were living on the streets. I have no problem with people
having money and spending it. It's the flaunting of it. It's pretty
much calmed down.''
   Dunne is a former president of Four Star, the television
production company founded by David Niven, Dick Powell and Charles
Boyer. Later, he produced such movies as ``The Boys in the Band,''
``The Panic in Needle Park,'' ``Ash Wednesday'' and ``Play It As it
Lays,'' adapted from a novel written by his sister-in-law, Joan
Didion. His brother is writer John Gregory Dunne.
   His new book, ``An Inconvenient Woman,'' is about the powerful
and the rich of Los Angeles, he says. ``It has to do with the
cover-up of a murder here. It will probably make me as unpopular
with the people in L.A. But I didn't get upset when people in New
York got mad at me over `People Like Us.'''
   Dunne is a latecomer to writing. He started his first book when
he was 50 and didn't get published until he was 53.
   ``I had a very interesting career, but like all show business
careers it had its ups and downs,'' he says. ``I began to get inner
feelings that this wasn't it. There was more to get out of me than
I was giving. One of the things as a producer that I was good at
was working with writers. I had a knack for telling a writer how to
make a script work.
   ``It never occurred to me that I could do this myself. But one
year my writer got an Emmy for a script that I practically told him
how to write. So, once I had the kids out of college, I said that's
it. I moved to Oregon and wrote for six months. My first book, `The
Winners,' was a flop. My first success was `The Two Mrs.
Grenvilles.'''

   For more than a year, S. Epatha Merkerson built
her life and career around ``The Piano Lesson.'' Her loyalty has
paid off.
   The actress turned down work that interfered with the play's
off-and-on travels from Chicago to San Diego to Washington to Los
Angeles and now New York. She accepted short-term job assignments
to fill in the employment gaps. A small movie role here. A guest
spot on television there.
   ``It's been that important,'' Merkerson says now. ``It always
was a dream of mine to act, but I don't think I could ever have
dreamed of this. If any kid ever wants to do anything I am living
proof that you can dream of something and have it come true.''
   Three days before ``The Piano Lesson'' opened on Broadway last
month, it won the Pulitzer Prize for playwright August Wilson.
Reviewers not only cheered the play, but singled out Merkerson for
her portrayal of Berniece, a strong woman determined to keep a
family heirloom, an old upright piano, from being sold.
   The play, part of Wilson's decade-by-decade chronicle of the
black experience in America, focuses on a battle between brother
and sister. The brother, played by Charles S. Dutton, is determined
to sell the piano to buy the land their ancestors worked on as
slaves. The sister wants to keep it as a reminder of their painful
past.
   ``I know Berniece,'' says the exuberant Merkerson, the opposite
of the reserved, uptight woman she plays. ``What we have in common
is that I am a collector, too, but on a small scale, of black
history. I like to keep things and so does Berniece. I collect
golliwogs, black memorabilia.''
   Merkerson was hired for ``The Piano Lesson'' without an
audition, solely on the strength of a recommendation from casting
directors Meg Simon and Fran Kumin. But she had a rapport with both
Wilson and director Lloyd Richards.
   ``Lloyd lets the actor create and as long as you are within the
concept of the play that we have all been discussing and reading,
you are fine,'' she says. ``He trusts the people that he hires.''
   During the long tour, Wilson refined the play, even changing the
ending to have more of a resolution in the fight over that piano.
   ``In the year and three months that I've been on the road with
the play, certain things changed every time we did it. And even
changed up until the rehearsal here for Broadway,'' Merkerson says.
``So it's been an ongoing process. And we're still finding new
things, which is marvelous. It's still very fresh for us. Even
though some people in the cast have been doing it for two years.''
   Merkerson's family, from Michigan, wasn't in show business,
although they were very theatrical. Everybody played an instrument,
sang or danced.
   ``But I'm the only one who actually pursued it,'' says
Merkerson, born in Saginaw but raised in Detroit. ``And they sort
of live vicariously through me.'' She studied first at Eastern
Michigan University in Ypsilanti and later at Wayne State in
Detroit where she focused on theater.
   Merkerson left Wayne State for a yearlong job with a children's
theater in Albany, N.Y. When it was over, the only logical thing to
do was come to New York. She arrived in 1978.
   ``There was lots of work then,'' Merkerson recalls. ``People
were really supporting small theaters. I literally was able to
support myself doing showcase work. In all my years in New York,
there has been only one month when I had to take a job outside the
theater.''
   Merkerson's first break was more than a decade ago in the
Chicago company of ``For Colored Girls Who Considered Suicide When
the Rainbow is Enuf.''
   ``The women I worked with in the `For Colored Girls' company
gave me the most valuable advice,'' she says. ``They knew I was
green and they said, `Look, no one knows you but us and your
mother. You make sure you do as much good work as you can. Get your
name out there because then people will know you do good work and
are reliable.'''
   Merkerson's other work in New York includes replacing Lonette
McKee in ``Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill,'' ``Three Ways
Home'' and ``Moms,'' the story of Moms Mabley starring Clarice
Taylor.
   ``I recall going into an audition for a big name director of a
film and he asked me who I studied with,'' Merkerson says. ``I
started naming the people I had worked with like Adolph Caesar,
Barbara Montgomery and Mary Alice.
   ``My most valuable lessons have come from those actors I have
worked with. I really are the people who have
helped me. They have taught me by watching me work and my being
able to work alongside them. They are truly my teachers.''
   One constant throughout her career has been the actress' refusal
to change her name ffeel like those or the stage.
   ``Epatha was the name given me at birth,'' says Merkerson. ``I
was named for a woman who was very influential in keeping my dad in
school.''
   The ``S'' stands for Sharon. ``But no one in my family calls me
that,'' she adds.
   ``People have told me that my name was very difficult and that I
should change it,'' she says. ``But I figure once you learn it, you
won't forget it. Only recently did I learn there was some meaning
to the name. A woman camay welcomed the release of
hostage Frank H. Reed, thanked both Syria and Iran but said again,
``We cannot rest ... until all hostages are free.''
   He called the news of Reed's release by kidnappers in Lebanon
cause for joy, but expressed concern about the plight of six other
Americans and 10 other Westerners who remain hostage.
   ``This is a joyous day for Mr. Reed, his family, his friends and
all Americans,'' Bush said in a written statement just hours before
his scheduled afternoon meeting with Robert Polhill, the American
hostage freed last week after 39 mopnths in captivity.
   ``With Mr. Reed's release, we have six innocent Americans that
are still being held hostage in Lebanon,'' as well as the other
foreign hostages, he said. ``Their predicament weighs on our mind
and tempers the joy we feel today.''
   The six Americans still hostage in the Middle East include Terry
Anderson of The Associated Press. He is the longest held, and has
been captive for more than five years.
   As he did eight days ago when Polhill was let go, Bush thanked
Syria and Iran _ two states the United States has accused in the
past of sponsoring terrorism.
   ``Once again, we wish to express our gratitude to all those who
through their efforts helped in Mr. Reed's release,'' said Bush.
``In particular we would like to thank the government of Syria for
facilitating this release. We would also like to thank the
government of Iran for using its influence to help bring about this
humanitarian step.''
   Bush said, ``We cannot rest, however, until all hostages are
free. We urge all parties who either hold hostages or have any
influence over the hostage takers to work for the expeditious and
unconditional release of the remaining hostages.''
   Earlier, the Bush administration today dispatched a special
recovery team to West Germany to greet Reed.
   There was no immediate word from State Department officials on
Reed's condition after 43 months in captivity.
   In Malden, Mass., Reed's wife, Fahima, said she was ready to
travel overseas ``as soon as I see the picture of my husband.''
   Earlier in the day, as optimism rose over the prospect of a
release, the White House said it was ``very hopeful'' that a
hostage would be freed. But it it reiterated its policy of no deals
with the kidnappers.
   Reed, a hostage in Lebanon for 43 months, was liberated by
Islamic militants and turned over to Syria, which played a
middle-man role for the Bush administration, the State Department
said in the first word of his release.
   ``We've got confirmation that he's been released and is in
Syrian hands in Lebanon,'' said Kim Hoggard, a State Department
spokeswoman, after receiving word from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus.
   The State Department had kept an open telephone line to the
Embassy in the expectation that Reed, former director of the
Lebanon International School in Beirut, would be liberated.
   Reed was seized in the Lebanese capital Sept. 9, 1986.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the State Department
hostage reception team was being dispatched to Wiesbaden, West
Germany, where hostage Reed will be taken for treatment.
   Amid reports in Iran that the planned release follows
``extensive talks'' between the Iranian government and the
hostage-holders, Fitzwater said, ``We've had a lot of third party
intermediary kinds of messages back and forth with Iran. But
there's nothing we can point to in terms of any specific reasons
for this release.''
   ``It is virtually impossible for us to know exactly the
contributions of Iran in these kinds of matter,'' the spokesman
added.
   He reiterated that there will be ``no deals'' with the
kidnappers.
   ``We know very little'' about the Islamic Revolutionary Dawn,
the group saying it would release Reed, Fitzwater said.
   At the State Department, Ms. Tutwiler said the Islamic Dawn
group ``was unknown to us before yesterday's announcement.'' Ms.
Tutwiler said it is probably associated with the Islamic Jihad, but
added: ``We know next to nothing about this group.''
   ``No one knows precisely what motivates the hostage-takers in
any of their activities, either in the taking of hostages or
holding them or releasing them,'' Fitzwater said. ``There is
considerable speculation that Iran and Syria and others in that
part of the world would like to have better relations with the
United States. The president has said goodwill begets goodwill. And
we are hopeful that indeed that is the case, that they do want
better relations.''
   Reed, 57, was director of the Lebanese International School when
he was seized from his chauffeur-driven car near the Beirut airport
on Sept. 12, 1986, as he was driven to play golf.
   The Massachusetts native had lived in Beirut for eight years. He
is a convert to Islam married to a Syrian Moslem.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``The Gods Must Be Crazy II''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Film opened April 13</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Gods Must Be Crazy'' entranced world audiences with its
simple, comedic tale of an African nomad who finds a Coca-Cola
bottle and transforms it into an icon.
   There was a slapstick romantic subplot as well, but the film's
great appeal stemmed from the character of the smiling, open-faced
actor with the impossible name of N!xau.
   Those who embraced the film will naturally approach ``The Gods
Must Be Crazy II'' with misgivings. Sequels never equal the
original, they say. ``The Godfather II'' was a rare exception.
   ``The Gods II'' can't possibly approach the joy of discovering
the delightful N!xau. But the new film is a creditable attempt,
combining another amusing male-female subplot with the central
story about N!xau's search for his lost children.
   Jamie Uys, a veteran South African filmmaker, composes his films
like silent comedies. Jammed with sight gags, they are almost
playable without dialogue. Uys even uses the silent-movie technique
of speeding up the action (by undercranking the camera) to
punctuate the comedy.
   His script presents three parallel and sometimes intersecting
plots:
   _ 1. Two young children of N!xau accidentally land in the truck
of some poachers racing across the desert with a cargo of elephant
tusks. The distraught father finds the trail and races after them,
day and night.
   _ 2. A New York lawyer (Lena Farugia) attends a conference in
southern Africa. She takes a sight-seeing flight in a tiny plane,
which crashes in the wildernesses. A research zoologist (Hans
Strydom) agrees to lead her back to civilization, their journey
encountering a series of mishaps.
   _ 3. A Unita scout (Treasure Tshabalala) and a Cuban soldier
(Erick Bowen) encounter each other in the wild and wage comical,
one-on-one warfare.
   The stories don't always mesh neatly, and some of the comedy
bits prove tedious, such as the heroine's climbing up and down a
tower to pump water. But there are a few bellylaughs, and N!xau
remains a captivating figure. The two youngsters, Eiros and Nadies,
are absolute wonders.
   Some will argue that Uys could have extracted lessons in the
senselessness of war, the corruption of ``civilization,'' the
dangers to wildlife. But he is an entertainer not a preacher, and
for that we can be grateful.
   Produced by Boet Troskie and released by Columbia Pictures,
``The Gods Must Be Crazy II'' is rated PG but it seems acceptable
for all audiences. Running time: 97 minutes.

   The story of a tragic love set against the moody backdrop of the
Louisiana Territory is told by the artist Anne-Louis
Girodet-Triosen in ``The Funeral of Atala.''
   The haunting oil, painted around 1811, has been acquired by the
High Museum of Art in Atlanta. This particular canvas _ there are
three known versions _ was commissioned by the Empress Josephine,
wife of Napoleon I, for the Chateau de Malmaison.
   The artist, who was known as Girodet, based his work on
``Atala,'' a popular novel of the day written by Francois Rene de
Chateaubriand, published in 1801. It told the story of Chactas, a
Natchez Indian who was captured by an enemy tribe and condemned to
death. Atala, the captive wife of the tribe's chie, falls in love
with Chactas and helps him escape.
   They wander the wilderness together, not giving in to physical
passions because Atala had taken a vow of chastity. Rather than
risk temptation, she poisons herself and dies.
   Girodet's neoclassical oil depicts her burial. She is lowered,
half clothed with folded hands across her belly, into a grave,
while a tortured Chactas hugs her knees.
   When the painting was first shown at the Salon of 1808, it was
enormously popular. Josephine liked it so much that she immediately
commissioned a copy.
   The original hangs in the Louvre. A small study for the painting
hangs in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.

museums in the United States.

<HEAD>The Artists: Preserving Traditional Culture in Cambodia</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sensuous, 1,000-year-old body
language of Cambodia's classical ballet will soon reach Western
audiences, as the country embarks on some ``dance diplomacy.''
   Beginning next month, members of the national dance company will
spend seven weeks performing in Britain and the Netherlands. The
group also has been invited to an arts festival in Los Angeles in
September. However, it is uncertain whether entry will be granted
since the United States has no ties with Phnom Penh.
   The cultural journey is part of an effort to help Cambodia out
of international isolation, and to show the world that its culture
has not been ``Vietnamized.''
   ``The truth is as you see it,'' said dance director Proeung
Chhieng. ``One cannot change one's soul. The Vietnamese have their
culture and we have ours.'' As he spoke young dancers went through
a rigorous practice session at the University of Fine Arts, weaving
hands, swaying hips and gliding across the floor to tell stories of
bygone loves and wars.
   Graduates of such training are to make their first trip to the
West since the early 1970s when the U.S.-sanctioned Lon Nol
government held power. The Khmer Rouge reign of terror all but
eradicated the classical dance.
   The foreign tours are seen by knowledgeable observers as small
steps toward international recognition by a government that most of
the world shuns in favor of a guerrilla coalition led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk.
   Domestically, the general revival of traditional arts has
probably helped the communist, Vietnam-installed regime to gain
some popularity and buttress its claim of fostering Cambodian
nationalism.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge in
early 1979, unquestionably has had a significant effect on the
country's political course. But Cambodians stridently maintain its
powerful neighbor has not debased, or even influenced, their
culture.
   At the university, for example, the only discernible Vietnamese
influence are a few teachers of Western instruments such as the
accordion and violin. There are reportedly as yet no qualified
Cambodians for these instruments.
   The Sihanouk-led coalition, which includes the Khmer Rouge, and
others have claimed Cambodia is the target of Vietnamese ``cultural
imperialism.''
   While independent observers, including Western aid agency
officials based in Phnom Penh, discount such charges, they note the
state and communist party make use of culture and put limits on
artistic expression.
   Minister of Culture Chheng Phon stressed it was the duty of
artists and intellectuals to support ``good leaders'' and help
fight against the Khmer Rouge.
   Despite censorship of the media the former actor and music
scholar claimed more artistic freedom existed under the current
government than those of Lon Nol or Sihanouk, who ruled Cambodia
first as king and then head of state.
   He said satires mocking official corruption and lust for power
currently being performed would certainly have been banned in
Sihanouk's time.
   In an interview, the minister said the past decade had seen the
rebirth of traditional culture from the Khmer Rouge era. The next
phase, he said, would emphasize ``unleashing the gray matter,
creating something, not just preserving.'' How far this can go in a
country at war and under one-party control remains to be seen.
   William Labban, an Australian ethnomusicologist helping the
ministry, said there was nothing in Phnom Penh that could be
described as an intellectual community. There are no literary
magazines and little printing of any material.
   ``It's a vacuum and it can't be filled while there is a war
going on. You need money and leisure before it can happen,'' he
said.
   But Labban and others say the revival of traditional culture has
been impressive given the meager resources and the physical
depredations and slaughter of artists, teachers and other
intellectuals by the ultra-radical Khmer Rouge.
   Today, the country has three archaeologists, two architects,
three veteran teachers of the classical dance and not a single
skilled librarian. The National Library is still reeling from the
wholesale destruction of books by the Khmer Rouge and the National
Museum, home of priceless statuary, is beset by swarms of bats and
electrical fixtures from the early 1920s.
   Despite Cambodia's political isolation, some foreign assistance
has trickled in from the Belgian government, U.N. Children's Fund,
private Australian agencies and Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
   Judy Ledgerwood, a Cambodia scholar from Cornell, is literally
stopping Cambodian culture from being eaten up by purging palm leaf
manuscripts of destructive insects. The literary and religious
texts, inscribed on palm leaves, are also being microfilmed and
stored in special containers.
   Angkor Wat, one of the world's architectural masterpieces, is
being restored by Indian experts but most other structures from
Cambodia's Golden Age between the 9th and 13th centuries are in
urgent need of care.
   Music, the dance and other arts were traditionally passed down
from teacher to student rather than recorded for posterity. But the
violence and chaos of recent decades has severed these fragile
links.
   To assist in some sort of preservation, Labban is training
students to record old music, and the fine arts university is
videotaping classical dances that have been reconstructed from the
fading memories of the few surviving authorities.

<TEXT>
   Carly Simon has been working hard these days,
doing everything from singing standards dressed in glamorous gowns
to writing songs to recording two albums, scoring a film and
writing children's books.
   She has a sense of achievement. And she's looking forward to
summer like a kid let out of school.
   Her newest album, ``My Romance,'' has 11 standards, plus a new
song co-written by Simon, ``What Has She Got?'' Arista Records
intends to release it with a record of her own songs that will come
out next fall.
   Some of those, written around her birthday, will be about the
passing of time. It will include ``Fisherman's Song,'' which sounds
like a folk song and has Judy Collins and Lucy Simon singing
backup, and ``Have You Seen Me Lately?'' _ a tune Simon wrote for
Meryl Streep to sing in Mike Nichols' upcoming film ``Postcards
From the Edge.''
   Simon did a Home Box Office special in April, with Harry Connick
Jr. as her guest. He played piano on some songs, and performed some
duets.
   ``We only went through them once and it sounds as if we've been
singing together our whole lives,'' Simon said. ``It was magical.
He's one of the most talented people I've ever met. He sings like
(Frank) Sinatra and plays piano like (Thelonius) Monk.''
   On May 6 she sang a few songs with Connick in his show at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   Simon recently watched a video of the one-hour special for the
first time because she had been afraid to watch it. She thought
their duet, ``I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do,'' was ``very
sexy.''
   But she was winging it with her on-stage patter. ``I hate
hearing myself; I feel embarrassed. They left them in; they felt it
lends a sort of down-to-earth quality.''
   For the album, she and pianist Michael Kosarin went through
``piles and piles of songs deciding which were best for my voice,''
winding up with six by Richard Rodgers. Then Marty Paich arranged
for orchestra and conducted.
   ``I can't imagine anybody treating those songs more sensitively
and romantically,'' Simon said. The record was made in three days,
four songs a day.
   She spent one week before the HBO special was shown in scoring
``Postcards From the Edge.''
   ``Fortunately, I was able to mobilize everything in my head and
work with a sense of urgency, panic and drama. It was very much
like studying for the exam when you haven't done the work all
semester.
   ``I think I wrote a great song for Meryl to sing opening the
picture. She sings two other songs, `You Don't Know Me,' the old
Ray Charles song, and one Shel Silverstein wrote.''
   The same week she and Doubleday editor Jacqueline Onassis
finished work on her children's book for next Christmas, ``The Boy
of the Bells.'' Her first children's book was ``Amy the Dancing
Bear,'' out for Christmas 1989. ``I'm going to put out one a year
probably for the rest of my life.''
   Her husband, Jim Hart, who can be seen in the audience at the
special, is finishing a novel.
   Sipping a big mug of tea during an interview, Simon talked about
Jackie O.
   ``She had great suggestions; she helped me enormously,'' she
said. ``The thing I love about her is that she didn't want to
`tighten it up' or take any of my personality out of it. The other
thing I feel is that her work thrills her. She doesn't do it dryly
or coldly. She is perfect for an artistic type of person. If I feel
like I'm just taking up somebody's time, I just feel awful.
   ``She didn't do this editing on `Amy.' That landed on her desk
almost perfect. I must have told that 1,000 times to Sarah and Ben.
This I started from scratch on a day in the sun when I felt like
thinking up a new story. It wasn't honed the way `Amy' was.''
   When her children Sarah, called Sally, 15, and Ben, 13, were
young, Simon made up stories for them.
   ``I loved doing it. I very rarely read to them because they
seemed to go to sleep better if all the lights were out,'' she said.
   ``Amy is a budding aritst. That was a story that Sally
particularly loved. Ben was quite angry that I didn't dedicate it
to him as well.'' She dedicated ``The Boy of the Bells,'' a
Christmas story, to him.
   The reason she wrote down Amy and some of her other bedtime
stories wasn't to publish but so she wouldn't forget them. ``I knew
when I had grandchidren the kids would say, `Remember the one you
used to tell about Amy.' My memory would be completely gone by that
time.''
   In her musical future, Simon wants to sing both her own songs
and standards. She wrote ``Fisherman's Song'' in 20 minutes after
coming home late from recording and finding Ben asleep. ``I smelled
his neck and kissed his eyelids, things he doesn't let me do
because he's 13. I translated that to an unrequited love situation.
A girl sneaks into a loved one's house and lies beside him. It
sounds like an old English folk song. It shows another style of
mine I feel equally at home in.''
   Simon made one previous album of standards, ``Torch,'' in 1981.
``Everybody gives Linda Ronstadt credit for having gone back and
done the standards. I always felt jealous she got all the credit
for it.''

<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patricia Volk writes fiction and nonfiction _
often at the same time.
   She calls her short stories ``riffs,'' narratives proudly made
up as she goes along. But even Volk knows you can't avoid injecting
a little truth in fiction. That's why she tears out pages from the
newspapers and circles articles of interest, just in case.
   One day, for instance, she read about ``syzygy,'' which means
the Earth, sun and moon are in rare alignment. Months later
``Syzygy'' became the title of a story included in her collection,
``All It Takes'' ($17.95, Atheneum).
   ``I was writing this story and I had a character press up
against her ex-lover for the last time and I thought, `Oh my God,
this is like syzygy. Every part connects,''' explained Volk.
   ``And I thought, where is that article? I wondered whether
people could line up like planets and I started rewriting it from
that. Most of my characters are struggling for some kind of
alignment, but they can't find a syzygy. It's very rare that you
can.''
   Volk, whose essays appear frequently in The New York Times,
wrote the novel ``White Light.''
   She can turn anything into a story. That's how the Manhattan
resident became a writer. Ten years ago, there was an incident at
the playground with one of her two children, and she couldn't stop
describing it to friends. Before long, the story was so polished
Volk decided to put it into writing.
   ``I tell people all the time that the only difference between
those who sell and those who don't sell are those who don't send it
out,'' she said. ``Some of the best writers don't send their work
out. They're afraid of rejection, it's too much trouble. They're
not sure they like it.''
   Volk can't resist applying a little ``creativity'' to real life.
The stain from a spilled cup of coffee gets a little bigger, that
delay on the subway becomes a little longer, encounters with
strangers keep getting more interesting.
   ``Your memory plays tricks on you,'' Volk said. ``Any incident
is like `Rashomon.' Play that coffee spill back and it's entirely
different. I think I bring a lot of fiction writing to the essay in
terms of taking leaps and nuance. I think of something that might
distort it, but it gives it a personal feel.''
   Volk's characters are often in danger of losing their lives in
thought, trying to impose order on events as logical as the daily
horoscope. In ``Reckless Dreamer,'' a woman reflects on the
personality of her former lover:
   ``He was an editor and lived the most censurious life she knew.
He criticized things other people never thought about, labels on
cans, the wording on menus, how people sat. He even criticized her
syntax and her dreams. If she'd stayed with him, he would have
criticized her into the ground.''
   In ``Which Is Better?,'' Del analyzes everything from sex to
lemonade. ``Thinks Too Much But Can't for the Life of Her Stop'' is
included in a list of things she doesn't like about herself.
   In the title story of ``All It Takes,'' Lucy is so unhappy that
she writes letters to the artist Georgia O'Keeffe, seeking advice
from an ``expert'' on the meaning of life.
   ``I think my characters are straddling a fence,'' Volk said.
``On one side they're powerless and on the other side they're
rationalists. They're trying to make sense of things.
   ``Lucy is really quite on the edge. She's trying to maintain her
equilibrium with those letters to Georgia O'Keeffe. But when you're
needy and you're feeling terribly, you look for answers in
everything. If it's a painter, and you move yourself to bounce
ideas off a dead person, fine.''
   Volk, who grew up in Manhattan and Long Island, had plenty time
to think as a child. When her older sister was born, her
grandfather quit his job to spend time with the baby. Fortunately,
Volk says, her birth was less eventful.
   ``Second-born children are different. Less is expected of them
and less time is devoted to them. It's a very nurturing thing for a
writer because there's less time physically for you. You don't have
that intensity beamed on you.''
   She worked full time, with writing squeezed in during lunch
hours. But Volk made the best of it, managing to compose 11 drafts
of ``White Light'' with the help of daily trips to a nearby coffee
shop.
   ``I'd get the coffee, I'd get the egg salad and the cheese and
I'd go to the library, and it was so wonderful,'' she recalled.
``The whole process was like Anne Tyler sharpening her pencils
before she crosses the threshhold into the room where she writes.''
   Having quit her job and with the kids in school, Volk can write
all the time now. The routine is simple: Just grab a cup of coffee,
sit down, and get to work. But writing remains mysterious, what
Volk might call a ``yellow banana'' _ something that doesn't turn
out the way it's expected.
   ``Writing the essay I kind of know what I think up front and I
can ask questions of my reader, but I don't know what I think up
front at all writing fiction.
   ``It's a real kind of discovery process for me. I do it with the
unsensitive part of my brain. The sensitive part of my brain comes
later, when I try to make sense of things.''

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Award-winning country star Ricky Van
Shelton describes music as the ``voice of the soul.''
   ``It just grabs hold of me,'' the 38-year-old singer says. ``A
beautiful melody just picks me up and carries me away.''
   Shelton, the reigning Country Music Association male vocalist of
the year, has had six No. 1 country music singles in the past three
years. His ``RVS III'' has been a No. 1 album on the country music
charts this spring.
   Singing has always been a part of life for Shelton, who spent 10
years as a pipe fitter and plumber before launching a full-time
music career. And it always will be.
   ``If it ends today, I'll be playing at my friends' house Friday
night and having a ball,'' he said. ``I've always done it. I
couldn't live without it. I play all the time _ early in the
morning and late at night.''
   Shelton, a star on the Grand Ole Opry, left his home in Grit,
Va., two days after Christmas in 1984 and moved to Nashville. In
1987 he burst onto the national country music scene with the album
``Wild-Eyed Dream.'' Both it and his second LP, ``Loving Proof,''
were million sellers.
   His hit singles include ``I'll Leave This World Loving You,''
``Somebody Lied,'' ``Life Turned Her That Way,'' ``Living Proof,''
``Statue of a Fool,'' ``Don't We All Have the Right'' and ``From a
Jack to a King.''
   He's one of Nashville's most active singers, hitting the road
for more than 200 shows a year.
   ``I don't count 'em,'' he said in an interview on a rare day off
the bus that carries him throughout the country. ``We stay gone all
the time.''
   Still, playing his guitar on stage and performing with his
six-piece band is the supreme satisfaction of his profession, he
says.
   ``When I'm on stage for an hour a night, I'm the happiest man in
the world. That hour makes up for the other 23. I live for that
hour on stage. When you get home, you can't wait to get back out
again. It gets in your blood.''
   For the past three years, Shelton has been living out his dream:
singing hit records, selling millions of albums, performing twice
on ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'' and receiving some
of the top awards in country music. It's been the fulfillment of
his vision that began when he sang gospel music in church by age 3.
   But there's also been a down side.
   ``It's been a wonderful, wonderful experience and I'm still
happy, but when you have big success, you have big problems,'' he
said. ``I never have time for myself any more or my friends or my
family. I don't have any privacy any more. There are all kinds of
decisions to make. I don't get to go fishing any more.
   ``It (success) has brought me happiness but you don't have time
to enjoy it. It's kind of a paradox.''
   Sometimes, he misses his days in south-central Virginia where he
worked at one time or another as a car salesman, appliance store
manager, grocery store clerk and house painter. His main jobs,
however, were as a plumber and pipe fitter making $5 to $10 an hour.
   ``It's a real highly skilled craft to make that stuff work and
fit. I miss the challenge of that and the camaraderie of the guys
you work with all day long. Them guys work hard.
   ``It was a very satisfying job when you got through and it was
nice to see it operate. I enjoyed welding and cutting things with
the cutting torch and getting dirty. And I got dirty.''
   Shelton is often compared to Randy Travis, who also broke into
country music about the same time singing a similar style of
traditional country music.
   ``Being compared to Randy, that's flattery. He's been super
successful.''
   Don't expect to find a lot of lyrics in Shelton's songs.
   ``I don't like a song with a lot of words in it. Too many words
kills the thought.''

   Forty American dancers will go to
Korea this summer to teach and perform modern dance.
   The Dayton Contemporary Dance Company from Ohio, the Doug Varone
Dance Company of New York City and seven teachers from the American
Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., will be in Seoul from July 30-Aug.
12.
   ADF was formed in the 1930s as the umbrella organization for
preserving choreography. It has many overseas programs including
China, Argentina, Venezuela, South Africa and the Soviet Union.
This is the second time ADF has brought both teachers and dance
companies to a nation for an intensive two-week period. ADF took
dancers to Japan in 1984 and 1986 and will go to India next winter.
   Courses to be taught include one on body knowledge so dancers
can understand how their body relates and moves as an instrument,
and one on African dance.

   Remember Irene Dunne and Cary Grant swapping

Bellamy looked on? Or Constance Bennett and Grant kicking up their

   The 1930s was a time when night life meant dressing up. And
nightclubs were lavish places where you could dine, wine and dance
everything from the two-step to the samba.
   Samiha D'Aiuto is trying to bring back those sylish platinum

   Medical ethicist Daniel Callahan was criticized
for picking on old people in his 1987 book about setting limits on
medical treatment for the elderly.
   This time, he may get criticism from more quarters.
   In his new book, ``What Kind of Life? The Limits of Medical
Progress,'' Callahan deals on a broader scale with the same
problem: how to rein in the demand for unending efforts to defeat
illness and death, and the unending costs involved.
   Callahan argues that Americans will have to accept limits on
medical treatment if there is to be any hope of holding down costs.
This could mean denying expensive, high-technology treatments to
those beyond a certain age, as well as to other patients on the
``ragged edge'' of medical progress.
   There should be ``a great reluctance to use curative,
life-extending technology in the care of the critically ill, likely
terminal, or irreversibly declining patient'' unless there is a
strong probability of a good long-term outcome, Callahan writes.
   ``A society would ... be well justified in the future to set an
age limit on the public provision of expensive, life-extending,
curative healthcare,'' according to the book.
   ``We will probably have to set limits of one kind or another for
all age groups,'' he said in a recent interview.
   The suggestion of an age cut-off is perhaps his most
controversial.
   ``It'll never happen, it shouldn't happen, it's a mistaken
idea,'' said one critic, Harry R. Moody of the Brookdale Center on
Aging at Hunter College in New York.
   Callahan, 59, is co-founder and director of the Hastings Center,
a research and educational organization that studies ethics in
medicine and biology.
   Currently, he said, decisions on allocating health care
resources are made ``on a case-by-case basis, and I'm arguing that
we'll probably have to do it by categorical standards _ that is to
say we might have to use age as a way of setting a limit.''
   One way to accomplish this would be to set age cut-offs for
Medicare reimbursement: for example, deny payment for heart bypass
surgery, chemotherapy or other expensive drug treatments to
patients over a certain age, perhaps 80 or 85.
   This, said Callahan, would not mean abandoning the sick. He
advocates increased emphasis on ``caring medicine'' rather than
``curative medicine,'' on good-quality long-term care at home and
in institutions, on relieving pain and suffering rather than merely
prolonging life.
   ``What I'm looking for is a kind of trade-off. We need to
improve long-term and home care ... and one of the prices we may
have to pay is to put some limits on that expensive high-tech
curative medicine.
   ``In effect what we have to do is say, `Look folks, you can't
have it all.'''
   Moody argues that an age cut-off is neither desirable nor
politically possible.
   ``When (Callahan) gets into specifics like cutting off care for
people beyond age 85 I say no, because it isn't going to happen and
it's distracting from the real issues,'' Moody said in an interview.
   Limits on treatment for terminal or critically ill patients
already exist, in the regulations governing Medicare reimbursements
and in the standards and protocols followed by doctors, and can be
tightened, Moody said.
   ``It could very well be that the medical community would develop
a practice, for example, of not giving dialysis to people in the
end stage of Alzheimer's disease. But that's different from saying
it's against the law to do so,'' Moody said.
   ``With a standard practice, someone who wants to deviate from
the practice can always do so,'' he said. ``As the system gets
squeezed for money, doctors will routinely try to discourage
families from having so-called heroic treatments. But they might
not succeed, and the family might say, `No, give him one more year
of life.'''
   That tendency to cling to life, whatever the cost, is part of
the problem, Callahan said. Advances in technology have made it
harder for patients, families and doctors to accept death.
   In looking at the problem of escalating health care costs in the
United States, Callahan focused first on the elderly because ``the
future of health care in this country belongs to the elderly, in
the sense that most people will die beyond the age of 65.
   ``We've done awfully well in eliminating the things that kill
people earlier in life.''
   The government in March reported that life expectancy in the
United States had reached a record 75 years, up from 62.9 years in
1940.
   This has led to increased emphasis, in research and in
treatment, on battling diseases of old age and extending lives
still longer. And the costs keep growing.
   Medicare alone is expected to cost $104 billion this year _
about one-twelfth of the federal budget _ and grow to $183 billion
by 1995. The Medicare trust fund could be bankrupt by the turn of
the century unless costs are curbed, its trustees reported last
month.
   Callahan sees the pursuit of longer and longer lifespans as ``an
open, endless frontier. Given the fact that the body ultimately
ages and dies there's no end to the amount of money that can be
spent to continue caring for the elderly.''
   But there is a limit to the amount of money that can _ or should
_ be made available for this battle, Callahan argued. Society and
government must weigh this commitment against its other priorities.
   Otherwise, he said, the endless pursuit of better health and
longer lives can use resources needed for other worthwhile goals,
from education and child care to building roads and fighting crime.
   ``It is ... reasonable for us as patients to ask our neighbor as
a taxpayer to care for us if we cannot care for ourselves,''
Callahan wrote. ``We cannot ask that neighbor for an ultimate cure
of disease, or to relieve us of the burden of having bodies that
age and die; and we cannot ask the medical profession or the
political order for that kind of benefit, either.''

<TEXT>
   The graying of America will be mirrored in other
countries, including the Soviet Union, which has sent three
scientists to Northwestern University to collaborate on research
into aging.
   ``The pressing issues are how best to deal with the medical
needs of the elderly ... without bankrupting the country, and how
to maintain their dignity and humanity while we provide them with
what they need,'' said Dr. James R. Webster Jr., director of the
Center on Aging at Northwestern's McGaw Medical Center.
   The Soviets will stay in Chicago for collaboration on projects
lasting one to three months, and researchers from Northwestern,
which initiated the idea for the program, will travel to Kiev later
this year for like endeavors.
   The visits are part of an agreement between Northwestern's
Center on Aging and the Soviets' Institute of Gerontology of the
Academy of Medical Sciences, the equivalent of the U.S. National
Institute on Aging.
   ``Chicago is one of the birthplaces of gerontology, and Kiev is
the most important city in the Soviet Union for that study,'' said
Celia Berdes, associate director of the Center on Aging.
   As an exchange participant, she will look at the Soviets' system
of elderly care.
   According to Webster, one major difference between U.S. and
Soviet elderly care is that the United States generally emphasizes
high-tech medical approaches.
   U.S. stroke victims, for example, typically undergo
computer-enhanced X-rays and studies of electrical impulses in the
brain, while the Soviets tend to direct resources to
rehabilitiation, he said.
   ``They would probably have more intensive and prolonged therapy
for the restoration of function _ more emphasis on getting them
back into their homes,'' Webster said.
   Not surprisingly, the Soviet researchers who have come to
Chicago will be trying to learn some of America's high-tech
methods, he said.
   Nataliya Bachinskaya, a neurologist, will work for three months
with John D.E. Gabrieli, assistant professor of psychology, on how
thinking processes change in people who have had strokes and
related ailments.
   ``We're also interested in how we can improve the functional
activity of the brains of old persons,'' Ms. Bachinskaya said.
   Yuri Jaroshenko, an internist, will work for one month with
Arthur Atkinson, director of pharmacology, and Richard Davison,
chief of cardiology, on a study of how heart drugs work in the
elderly.
   Yuri Rushkevich, a physiologist, will work for one month with
John Disterhoft, associate professor of cell biology and anatomy,
in a study of learning in aged animals.

<HEAD>Report: Retirees Could See Loss of Health Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Few retirees have access to company-sponsored
health insurance and many of those who do are seeing their benefits
shrink as businesses try to control skyrocketing costs, a
government report says.
   ``Although seen as a low-cost employee benefit decades ago,
retiree health coverage has now become a major concern for
companies because retiree health costs have risen and are expected
to continue to increase dramatically in the future,'' the General
Accounting Office reported.
   More than 5 million retired Americans are covered by such health
plans, of whom 2 million are under 65, the GAO said. Private health
coverage is particularly important for younger retirees because
people do not become eligible for Medicare health benefits until
age 65.
   The GAO study was conducted at the request of Rep. Edward R.
Roybal, D-Calif., who chairs the House Select Committee on Aging.
   The mission was to find out what was happening to health
coverage for retirees, said Gary Christopherson, the committee's
director of health legislation. Now that the study has been
completed, it's ``not as clear that we know what we want to do,''
he said.
   ``At this point, Congress is not clear uired contributions from retirees
under
65 and 53 percent passed on part of the cost to retirees 65 and
over, the GAO added.
   Christopherson said the few options Congress has available could
have negative side effects. For instance, he said, if employers
were required to provide health coverage for retirees or Congress
tried to make it easier for them to do so, the quality of existing
plans could suffer.
   ``No matter what you gain you're going to lose as much in
return,'' he said. ``There's a risk involved.''
   The GAO said some companies providing retiree health care
coverage might drop the plans if the Financial Accounting Standards
Board follows though with a plan to require corporations to show
future costs on their balance sheets. The FASB is an independent
agency that sets accounting standards for private companies.

<TEXT>
   A graying America requires professionals
better equipped to deal with health care problems of the elderly,
say publishers of a new reference manual geared toward just that.
   The Merck Manual of Geriatrics is ``oriented toward medicine,
disease and even health of the aged,'' said Dr. P. Roy Vagelos,
president and chief executive officer of Merck &amp; Co., the Rahway,
N.J.-based pharmaceuticals company that published the book in April.
   It follows in the tradition of The Merck Manual, first published
in 1899, a standard reference on symptoms and diseases.
   The 1,300-page manual on geriatric medicine describes symptoms
and suggests treatments for older patients. Merck sells the
handbook at cost, $20, company officials said.
   Topics include malnutrition, sleep disorders, falls, fractures,
incontinence, acute confusion and geriatric emergencies.
   Despite the aging of the population, medical schools offer
little training in specialized treatments for older patients, Dr.
William B. Abrams, co-editor of the manual.
   ``Recent statistics for people completing their internships show
that only about 4 percent were able to say that in their medical
training they had what was quoted as an extensive experience in
geriatrics, meaning a two-week exposure,'' he said.
   Abrams said physicians must adjust their approach when treating
elderly patients.
   ``The fact of the matter is that yes, many physicians,
internists, have taken care of older people. But one definition of
experience is making the same mistake over and over,'' he said.
   People over 65 make up 12 percent of the nation's population,
but use 30 percent of health care services, Vagelos said. By the
year 2000, the over-65 population will grow to 20 percent and will
use about 50 percent of health care services.

   John Morton-Finney has a dozen academic
degrees, is fluent in seven languages and lectures and studies.
That, and the fact that he's 100, makes him ``America's
most-seasoned scholar,'' according to President Bush.
   Morton-Finney went to Washington recently to meet Bush, who said
he has lived ``the life of the mind better and longer than anyone
else.''
   ``Try to praise him though, and he'll bawl you out, saying,
`There's nothing extraordinary about me,' '' said Bush, who noted
Morton-Finney's accomplishments when he honored teacher-of-the year
Janis T. Gabay of San Diego.
   Bush wasn't the first president Morton-Finney had met. The first
was Franklin D. Roosevelt. He went to Washington this time because
he was invited, but said, ``I've been voting the Democrat ticket
since Roosevelt.''
   Morton-Finney was honored April 25 at Harvard University with a
citation from the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race
Relations for his ``lifelong devotion to higher education and
public service.''
   At a lecture he gave there, he asked students and professors to
examine whether the United States had lived up to the ideals in the
motto ``e pluribus unum,'' Out of many, one.
   ``All the people of the nation should be of one mind when it
comes to the matter of civil rights,'' he said. ``But even today,
some people don't believe in integration, which tells me they are
not good Americans. And a good American believes that one man is as
good as another.''
   Son of a former slave, Morton-Finney became interested in the
law because he wanted to know what he could do to protect himself.
``You know, when a person is deprived of doing what he wants to do
in life it becomes very burdensome,'' Morton-Finney said.
   Slaves, he said, ``were not by law or by custom allowed to read
or even have a pencil. The law was very strict and was strictly
enforced.''
   When his father was freed by the Emancipation Proclamation he
learned to read and write, Morton-Finney said. His mother, born
free, also knew the value of an education.
   ``My father and my mother both always urged the children to go
to school. I learned to like to know about things.''
   Morton-Finney was 14 when he spent all his savings, 30 cents, to
buy his first book, a dictionary.
   And he has spent his life learning. He reads three books at a
time, and the television in his book-filled home always is tuned to
a news channel.
   It's surprising he has not written a book of his own. ``They say
every man can write a book but I haven't written mine yet. It's a
big job.''
   Morton-Finney was born along the Ohio River in western Kentucky.
Of his six siblings, one survives, 95-year-old Viola, who lives in
Pennsylvania.
   When his mother died, Morton-Finney went to live with his
grandfather in Jefferson City, Mo., where he attended segregated
schools until he joined the Army in 1911. He completed his first
academic degree and became a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse. He
taught until World War II, when he again joined the military.
   When he returned home from war, Morton-Finney married Pauline A.
Ray, who taught French at Lincoln College in Missouri. They
traveled to Indianapolis, where they both taught in public schools.
   He became a lawyer, graduating from Indiana University's law
school.
   Mrs. Morton-Finney died in 1975 after 54 years of marriage.
Their daughter, Gloria, who shares a home with her father, is a
public school instructional coordinator.
   There's one thing America's most-seasoned scholar never got
around to learning _ how to drive.
   ``I've never driven a car in my life, Morton-Finney said. ``I
sit in the back seat.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Report Shows Abuse Cases Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reported cases of elder abuse rose 12 percent in
Massachusetts last year, reflecting a steady increase over five
years, a state official said.
   According to the study, reports of elder abuse and neglect
increased to 3,094 for the year ended June 30, 1989, compared to
2,769 cases the previous year.
   Reported cases in the 1984 fiscal year totaled only 1,529, so
the latest statistics represent an increase of 102 percent within
six years.
   ``For every report of abuse or neglect we receive, we know that
there are many others who suffer in silence,'' said Elder Affairs
Secretary Paul J. Lanzikos.
   But Lanzikos, Donna M. Reulbach, program director for elder
protective services, and Craig R. Fox, western regional supervisor,
all said it was unclear whether the increase meant more elders were
being abused.
   Reulbach said the increase may have resulted in part from a
greater awareness among health care professionals, police and
others covered by the state's mandatory reporting law.
   Hospitals, doctors and others often were more willing to accept
families' stories that an injury to an older person resulted from
an accident, not abuse, than they were for children, Reulbach said.
That is changing, she said.
   Fox said he has also noticed that drugs are playing a role,
sometimes involving grandchildren seeking to extort money for drugs
from a grandparent.
   Joan Hatem, a protective service worker and supervisor at Elder
Services of the Merrimack Valley, said alcohol also plays a role,
frequently in cases of spousal abuse.
   That abuse, she said, may have gone unnoticed for years until
the abused person reached age 60 and fell under the requirements of
the reporting law.
   Hatem and Lanzikos said sometimes the abuse is unintentional,
for example, confining a confused older person to their room to
keep them from wandering off. In those cases, Hatem said, a social
worker can resolve the situation.
   Reulbach said serious abuse cases are reported to district
attorneys for possible action.
   Lanzikos said his agency also recently set up a program to help
older people threatened by self-neglect. But except in cases of
mental incompetence, older people can legally reject state
intervention. Fox said that happens in about 23 percent of reported
cases.
   The report covered abuse in homes and other community settings.
Reports of abuse in nursing homes are handled by the Department of
Public Health.

<HEAD>Plan Now for Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET WALSH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of Americans have benefited from the
Social Security Act, approved by Congress in 1935. But the Social
Security Administration says that by the year 2048 money for the
future may be depleted if Congress continues to borrow against the
fund.
   There is strong evidence that Social Security might radically
change by the time today's baby boomers reach retirement age.
Because of the uncertainty about the future of Social Security and
the extent to which corporations will continue to contribute to
retirement funds for employees, my advice to all consumers is to
begin planning now for retirement.
   Americans are almost evenly split on the issue of whether the
Social Security system will be able to pay them retirement
benefits. Reponding to an Employee Benefit Research Institute and
Gallup survey, 47 percent of those surveyed said they would
probably not get a penny from the Social Security fund, while 49
percent expressed confidence in the system.
   It's interesting to note, though, that those with a positive
outlook about their retirement fund tended to be 55 and older.
Nevertheless, only 7 percent of this age group felt that Social
Security would meet all their retirement needs, while 55 percent
said the fund will provide one-third or less of their livelihood in
the golden years.
   Despite this skepticism, consumers are not beginning to plan for
retirement soon enough. While retirement planning was the key
concern among clients of financial planners, most clients don't
begin retirement planning until they are 35 to 44 years old, 10
years later than most planners recommend.
   There are many reasons why all consumers should begin planning
today for retirement. Increased longevity rates mean we will have
longer retirements than previous generations. Planning for
long-term care and medical expenses _ which are rising annually at
a rate of 20 percent to 30 percent _ should also be a key concern.
Further, because most people want to maintain the same standard of
living they enjoyed while working, money that's put away for
retirement must account for inflation, which typically increases
4.5 percent annually.
   I advise all consumers to take these small steps now:
   _ Participate in a company-sponsored savings program, most of
which earn tax-deferred interest until retirement. If you are
self-employed, set up a Keogh Plan.
   _ Save at least 10 percent of income, preferably 15 percent to
20 percent.
   _ Invest in an individual retirement account, or IRA, one of the
few tax-deferred saving programs remaining since the enactment of
the Tax Reform Act.
   _ Consider tax-sheltered annuities. If you work for a religious,
charitable or educational organization, or state university or
public school system, you may be eligible to participate in a
tax-sheltered annuity plan.
   _ Consider tax-exempt or tax-deferred investments such as
municipal bonds or single-premium or flexible-premium deferred
annuities.
   _ Consider diversifying your portfolio to include stocks or real
estate, if you feel comfortable with these growth investments.

<HEAD>President Jefferson a Model Gardener</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends of broccoli, saddened by George
Bush's dislike of it, can get a lift from another president. Thomas
Jefferson, master gardener as well as author of the Declaration of
Independence, grew numerous varieties.
   Broccolis _ green, purple, white _ appear repeatedly in
gardening notes Jefferson kept throughout his life, showing he was
planting the vegetable in his own kitchen garden at Monticello in
Virginia and exchanging seeds with friends.
   Broccoli aside, anyone looking for a patron saint of gardening
will find the perfect model in Jefferson, who said, ``No occupation
is so delightful to me as the culture of the earth, and no culture
comparable to that of the garden.''
   Jefferson lived to age 83, statesman, inventor, architect,
astronomer, founder of the University of Virgina. But despite his
myriad activities, he had time for a garden diary, starting with an
entry dated March 30, 1766, when he was 22: ``Purple hyacinth
begins to bloom.''
   The burdens of the presidency did not stop him. On April 6,
1804, for example, he wrote, ``Sowed seeds of the East India
asparagus in small bed.'' Sometimes he jotted garden notes on odd
sheets of paper.
   In 1808, his last year in the White House, Jefferson wrote to a
friend, ``It is now among my most fervent longings to be on my
farm, which with a garden and fruitery, will constitute my
principal occupation in retirement.''
   Fortunately for us, the nation's third president left a wealth
of material on his gardening and farming, highlights of which are
in the 704-page ``Thomas Jefferson's Garden Book.'' First published
in 1944 by the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, the
book was reprinted in 1985. It's available through bookstores and
at the gift shop at Monticello.
   It's worth a trip to Monticello in Charlottesville, Va., just to
see the gardens, restored more than 50 years ago by the Garden Club
of Virginia. Vegetable growers will be fascinated by the kitchen
garden stretching 1,000 feet along the sunny southern slope and
containing more than 250 varieties, including English peas,
Jefferson's favorite. (A Virginian of his times, Jefferson had
slaves to help him, but he was deeply troubled by the question and
was one of the first Americans to propose a plan of abolition.)
   Through correspondence and accounts of others, the Garden Book,
admirably annotated by Edwin Morris Betts, a biology professor at
the University of Virginia, gives us rare glimpses of Jefferson.
One chronicler, Margaret Bayard Smith, tells us he kept a pet
mocking bird in a cage suspended among his flowers and plants in
his White House apartment. ``Whenever he was alone, he opened the
cage and let the bird fly about the room. ... It would alight on
his table and regale him with its sweetest notes or perch on his
shoulder and take its food from his lips.''
   The correspondence shows us Jefferson on expeditions in southern
France and Italy while he was minister to France, always looking
for varieties of such crops as rice that might do well in America.
He says, for example, ``The olive tree is least known in America,
and yet the most worthy of being known. Of all the gifts of heaven
to man, it is next to the most precious. ... Perhaps it may claim a
preference even to bread, because there is such an infinitude of
vegetables which it renders a proper and comfortable nourishment.''
   Intimate views of Jefferson as gardener and farmer in his old
age also are contained in ``Jefferson and His Time, the Sage of
Monticello'' (Little Brown and Co., 1981), the sixth and final
volume of Dumas Malone's epic biography. His previous volumes won
the Pulitzer Prize for history in 1975.
   The books tell us Jefferson collected seeds everywhere _ county
neighbors, nurserymen, naturalists, from a friend in Italy, even
from Gen. Lafayette's aunt. Mrs. Smith, who was the wife of the
publisher of the National Intelligencer, visited him in his
retirment and reported he kept his vegetable seeds in a little
closet. Peas and beans were in tin canisters, she said, but all the
other seeds were ``little phials, labeled and hung on little
hooks,''' everything being in the ``neatest order.''
   As the years went on, Jefferson suffered from rheumatism, but

<HEAD>Bill Aims at Testing Drivers 80 and Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents 80 and older will need
hearing, sight and driving skills tests every two years under a
proposal in the Legislature.
   A law being pushed for the second year by Rep. Marian Lewis
would require more than 300,000 Floridians to prove they're not
hazardous drivers, beginning in 1991.
   While Ms. Lewis contends the measure would keep dangerous
drivers off the road, critics say the bill is discriminatory. That
argument helped kill her bill in committee last year.
   In 1986, a similar bill proposed by Sen. Jack Gordon failed when
legislators were swamped by mail from constituents opposing the
idea.
   Ms. Lewis' bill has cleared the House committee on highway
safety, and she is optimistic the measure will pass the Legislature
this year.
   ``The people of Florida favor testing elderly drivers even
before they reach 80,'' Lewis said. ``The bill is such a minimal
step toward getting unsafe drivers off our roads. I think we should
be re-testing drivers starting at age 60 _ and I'm 60.''
   Some legislators say the bill discriminates against a specific
age group and makes no provision for transportation for those no
longer able to drive.
   ``I don't know why we're singling out the elderly,'' said Rep.
Art Simons.
   Ms. Lewis noted that most accidents involving young drivers are
due to aggressive or careless driving _ not deteriorating skills.
   ``Older people's reflexes are just going to get worse,'' she
said. ``If they aren't competent now, they'll be less so later.''
   Indiana, Illinois, New Hampshire and the District of Columbia
require drivers to take road tests after a certain age, generally
75. New York state is considering what, if anything, to do about
older drivers.

<HEAD>Rig Count Drops By Five</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and natural gas
rigs is down for the fourth straight week, slipping by five in this
week's tally to total 927, Baker Hughes reported Monday.
   Although the rig count has declined over the past three weeks,
the current total is well ahead of the 761 rigs counted at this
time a year ago.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Louisiana and Pennsylvania
posted the largest gain with four each, while North Dakota and
California each were up three.
   Oklahoma, down seven, showed the sharpest decline for the week,
with Texas off four, Colorado and New Mexico down three and Ohio
down one.
   Kansas, Michigan and Wyoming were unchanged.

<TEXT>
   The single largest plunge in the South
Korean stock market Monday and another day of labor unrest forced
President Roh Tae-woo to convened an emergency meeting of his
economic ministers.
   The composite stock index hit an 18-month low after falling
31.71 points to close at 688.66, its lowest level since Oct. 13,
1988. The index has lost 24 percent this year.
   Protests by investors crippled operations at stock trading
offices in Seoul and at least six other cities. Newspapers said
some had to close their offices to keep out angry customers.
   Militant shipyard workers, whose strike was broken up over the
weekend, fought running battles with riot police in the
southeastern port city of Ulsan and sympathy protests spread
nationwide.
   Economic ministers met in emergency session Monday night to
review the nation's growing economic crisis, news reports said.
   Finance Minister Chung Yung-euy was recalled from New Dehli,
where he was to attend a meeting of the Asian Development Bank
beginning Tuesday, a presidential aide said.
   Roh met during the day with Deputy Prime Minister Lee Seung-yun
and economic advisors to draft new measures to curb inflation and
spiraling land speculation, Presidential press secretary Lee
Soo-jung told reporters.
   Lee said Roh ordered the formation of a special team to consider
ways to stabilize the real estate market, including those that may
encourage securities and insurance companies to dispose of their
land holdings.
   News reports said investors staged sit-down protests demanding
special government measures to prevent a stock market crash.
   In the central city of Chongju, investors roamed through nine
trading offices, smashing windows and furniture, Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency, reported. Some protesters demanded the stock
market be closed.

<HEAD>Court Approves Random Drug Tests for Transportation Department
Workers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let the government
force thousands of Transportation Department employees in sensitive
jobs to take random drug tests.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected an appeal by a
labor union that said the tests violate the government workers'
privacy rights.
   Today's action is further evidence the justices are willing to
allow widespread random drug testing of public employees.
   Only Justice Thurgood Marshall voted to hear arguments in the
case. Four votes are needed to grant such review.
   Transportation Department officials approved a drug-testing
program in 1987 for some 30,000 people in jobs the agency said have
a direct impact on public health, safety or national security.
   Nearly two-thirds of the workers who must undergo the random,
periodic urinalysis tests are air traffic controllers.
   The rest hold a variety of jobs, including airplane inspectors
and mechanics, traffic safety specialists and mail van drivers.
   The tests were challenged by the American Federation of
Government Employees, which represents many of the workers but not
the air traffic controllers.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last September that
the tests do not violate the employees' constitutional rights.
   ``The program is supported by sufficiently compelling
circumstances to justify the invasions of privacy entailed,'' the
appeals court said.
   Those who test positive once for illegal drugs such as marijuana
or cocaine generally are transferred to non-senstive jobs. If they
test positive a second time they are fired.
   The appeals court relied heavily on the Supreme Court's only
drug-testing rulings. In them, the justices last year upheld drug
and alcohol tests for railway workers involved in accidents and for
U.S. Customs Service employees applying for certain jobs.
   But neither of those rulings determined the constitutionality of
randomly administered drug tests.
   The high court subsequently, without comment, rejected appeals
challenging random tests for other public employees.
   Drug tests of federal workers stems from a 1986 order by
then-President Ronald Reagan calling for a drug-free workplace. The
Bush administration has endorsed the anti-drug campaign.
   Neither the court's 1989 rulings nor the cases acted on today
bear directly on workers in private employment.
   The federal employee union's appeal said more than 345,000
government workers now are subject to drug tests that violate their
privacy and dignity. Millions more who work for states or cities or
in private employment also must submit to such tests, the union
said.
   The Transportation Department program means that each affected
worker ``will continue to be subject to random selection for the
remainder of her worklife, regardless of how often she has been
tested, how uniformly innocent her prior tests or how unblemished
her work and health records,'' the union said.
   The case is AFGE vs. Skinner, 89-1272.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration for its views about Oklahoma's attempt to collect a
sales tax on cigarettes and other items sold at a Shawnee
convenience store owned and run by an Indian tribe.
   The court said it wants to know what Justice Department lawyers
think about a ruling that bars the imposition of such a tax.
   A response from the government lawyers might take months, and
the justices are not expected to say whether they will review the
case until getting that response.
   The store belongs to the Citizen Band Potawatomi Indian Tribe,
and is located on land held in trust for the tribe by the federal
government.
   Oklahoma law requires all vendors to collect from consumers
sales taxes of 6 or 7 percent _ 4 percent for the state and 2 or 3
percent for local communities.
   The state also imposes an excise tax on the sale of cigarettes.
   The Potawatomis have never collected sales taxes or the
cigarette excise tax on items sold in their convenience store, and
in 1987 state officials assessed the tribe $2.7 million for the
sale and distribution of untaxed cigarettes.
   The tribe challenged the assessment in court, and U.S. District
Judge Lee R. West blocked enforcement of the cigarette tax pending
the tribe's lawsuit.
   West later ruled that cigarettes sold to tribal members could
not be taxed but that the tribe must collect taxes on cigarettes
sold to non-members.
   But the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last November ruled
that the tribe does not have to collect any state or local taxes on
items sold at the store, even to non-members.
   The appeals court said Oklahoma officials wrongly relied on a
1980 Supreme Court ruling in a Washington state case to justify the
taxing of sales to non-tribal members.
   In the 1980 case, the appeals court said ``the Indian tribe had
opted to come under state jurisdiction.'' It said, ``Because no
such jurisdiction exists in this case, Oklahoma's reliance on (the
1980 decision) is misplaced.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Oklahoma officials said, ``The
case turns on whether federal law has pre-empted state law or
whether state action has infringed tribal self-government.''
   The appeal added, ``The state simply suggests that the tribe may
operate its government in any way that it sees fit. However, if the
tribe operates a business in the state, it must obey applicable
state laws.''
   The case is Oklahoma Tax Commission vs. Citizen Band Potawatomi
Indian Tribe, 89-1322.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with
soybeans leading the decline amid forecasts for cooler, wetter
weather in the Midwest.
   Soybean futures surged more than 30 cents a bushel last week,
partly on the belief that last week's hot, dry weather might set
the tone for the growing season.
   The drought fears were dispelled, though, by several forecasts
issued late Friday by the National Weather Service, which predicted
cooler, wetter weather in the region this week and normal to
above-normal rainfall in the Midwest from May through July.
   Last week's advance in soybean prices prompted an increase in
farmer selling of soybeans over the weekend, triggering further
selling of futures this morning, analysts said.
   The weather outlook is also bearish for corn futures. Wheat
futures opened nearly unchanged.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to \ cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.70 a bushel;
corn futures were \ cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $2.79} a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with May at $1.62\ a

a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent lower to .03 cent higher with

pork bellies were .45 cent lower to .08 cent higher with May at

   Cattle futures settled higher on Friday. Pork futures were mixed.

   PepsiCo Inc. said Monday its first-quarter
profit rose 10.2 percent, led by markedly better returns in its
domestic soft drink and worldwide restaurant operations.
   The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said it earned $181.9 million,
or 68 cents per share in the three months ended March 24, compared
with $165.1 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 24.3 percent to $3.68 billion, from
$2.96 billion a year ago.
   Operating earnings increased 26 percent for the quarter, fueled
by strong volume growth in its soft drink, restaurant and snack
foods operations.
   Operating profit in soft drinks rose 27 percent to $151.5
million as sales rose 25 percent to $1.3 billion. Excluding
acquisitions, sales were up 8 percent, and operating profit jumped
24 percent.
   Domestic soft drink profits rose 32 percent on an 8 percent
sales gain, including double-digil growth in the Diet Pepsi and
Mountain Dew brands, while international profits fell in comparison
with strong results a year ago.
   Operating profit from snack foods rose 20 percent to $186.4
million as sales rose 27 percent to $1.1 billion. Profit growth was
fueled by a 50 percent increases in international results excluding
the effect of acquisitions.
   Higher advertising and marketing expenses, costs of new product
introductions and a shift in the sales mix to lower margin products
led to slower growth in domestic snack food operations, although
volume sales rose 6 percent. Increased sales of Ruffles and
Santitas were partly offset by a decline in Doritos.
   Worldwide restaurant earnings rose 39 percent to $91.0 million
on a 22 percent sales increase to $1.3 billion.
   Operating profit rose 39 percent at Pizza Hut to $51.1 million
on a 23 percent sales increase to $633.5 million, and 37 percent at
Kentucky Fried Chicken to $23.5 million on a 15 percent sales
increase to $322.7 million.
   The Taco Bell chain's operating profit rose 48 percent to $16.4
million on sales growth of 27 percent to $356.3 million.

   Ames Department Stores Inc. today
announced that its chief executive officer, Peter B. Hollis, has
resigned and been replaced by Stephen L. Pistner.
   Ames, which last week filed for bankruptcy court protection from
its creditors, described Pistner, 58, as ``a specialist in
turnaround situations in the retailing industry.''
   Pistner was chairman and chief executive officer of Montgomery

   Pistner will also be chairman of the Ames board of directors.
His appointment must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York, where Ames filed under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act
on April 25.
   Ames, whose troubles have been blamed on its acquisition of the
Zayre discount chain in 1988, is the nation's fourth-largest
discount retailer. It operates more than 600 stores in 20 states
and has 55,000 employees.
   Ames announced earlier this month that it would post a $228

   The U.S. dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies in thin, sluggish European trading today. Gold prices
fell.
   Trading was quiet, with Japanese markets closed for a national
holiday. Some European markets will be closed Tuesday for May Day,
and many dealers took an extended break.
   ``Even for a quiet day, this was particularly boring,'' said one
Frankfurt dealer.
   Traders said the market is waiting for Friday's release of U.S.
employment data for April. Negotiations between East and West
Germany on monetary union are expected to make strong progress this
week and also could affect the market.
   In London, the dollar fell to a closing 158.85 Japanese yen from
159.08 at Friday's close in Tokyo.
   The British pound rose to $1.6390, from $1.6360 late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates included: 1.6787 West German marks, up from 1.6755; 1.4512
Swiss francs, down from 1.4560; 5.6335 French francs, up from
5.6240; 1.8884 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8845; 1,230.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,228.00, and 1.1649 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1632.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6825 West
German marks, 1.4538 Swiss francs, 159.05 Japanese yen, and
1,229.43 Italian lire.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $367.75 a troy ounce,
from $370.75 bid late Friday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $367.00, from $370.00 bid late Friday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 37 cents to close at a bid
$372.55.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.92 a
troy ounce, from $4.95 bid late Friday.

   Stocks fell slightly Monday, depressed by economic
and political worries that stemmed partly from local government
elections later in the week that are seen as a test of the Thatcher
government's popularity.
   Traders said a bearish mood pervaded the London Stock Exchange.
Besides the political worries, dealers said, they expected a somber
quarterly report from the Confederation of British Industry on
Tuesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 3.2
points, or 0.15 percent, to close at 2103.4.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 5.1 points at 1653.6
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 3.82 points
to close at 1,140.35. Volume totaled 326.3 million shares, vs.
536.7 million Friday.

<HEAD>Digital To Unveil First Products From Alliance With Apple Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Computer Corp. and Apple Computer Inc.
will announce products on Tuesday that allow Digital and Apple
computers to connect easily, the first fruit of a 2-year-old
alliance between the companies.
   Through the software, Apple Macintosh personal computers will be
able to share computer files with Digital machines, to send
messages to Digital computers and to use printers hooked up to a
Digital network, among other things, said John Rose, who head's
Digital's personal computer division.
   ``They're all done with the Macintosh friendly user interface,''
said Rose, referring to the on-screen graphics display that makes
the Macintosh easy to use by replacing typed commands with pictures.
   Several outside suppliers provide software to connect Apple and
Digital computers, but Rose said none is as comprehensive as the
Digital-Apple system.
   Digital computers usually are connected in a network or to a
mainframe computer, while the Macintosh, a desktop computer,
usually is a stand-alone machine. The software will allow companies
using both types of machines to link them in a network.
   ``There is a substantial audience out there'' for the products,
Rose said.
   Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., agreed that the market for the products could be
considerable. She said there are many companies that rely on both
Digital and Apple computers.
   She said the products are important for Apple because it needs a
credible ``server,'' or a computer that acts as the central file
repository in a network of computers, while Digital needs a desktop
computer that has wide acceptance.
   ``It has some positive marketability for both companies,'' she
said.
   Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., and Apple, based in Cupertino,
Calif., announced their intention to develop the products in
January 1988.
   In the past two years, Digital, the second-largest computer
company after International Business Machines Corp., has released
products that allow IBM computers to be linked with Digital
machines.
   Ms. Conigliaro said the delay in releasing the Apple-Digital
products probably is due to ``the kind of things that go on when
companies are big and bureaucracy is the modus operandi.''
   Linking computers from various makers is becoming increasingly
popular as the computer industry moves from proprietary, or
company-specific, computers and software to machines and software
that adhere to industrywide standards.
   Companies increasingly want all their computers to be able to
communicate with each other and to share files, analysts say.
   Rose said additional products to further link Apple and Digital
computers will be announced in the future.

<HEAD>Say Trade Reporting Rule Anti-Competitive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A recent London Stock Exchange rule change that
allows for a delay in reporting large trades is anti-competitive,
the Office of Fair Trading said Monday.
   Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, said the
24-hour delay in reporting large deals deprives the market of
information that could affect the price of stocks.
   It also gives trading opportunities to those market makers
involved in the deals which are denied to their competitors, Borrie
said.
   The exchange decided in early 1989 to postpone the reporting of
trades of over 100,000 pounds, or $164,000 until 24 hours after
completion of the transaction.
   Market makers had complained that instantaneous publication of
large share deals on the Stock Exchange Automated Quotation system
spoiled liquidity and led to volatility in share prices.
   Borrie said he had not uncovered any evidence that liquidity was
affected or that the delay reduced volatility.
   The director-general sent his report to Trade Secretary Nicholas
Ridley to decide what action, if any, the government should take.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Corp. reported a 42 percent decrease in first
quarter earnings Monday, blaming lower profits from its steel and
defense industries.
   The Dallas-based company, which is operating under bankruptcy
court protection, said earnings for the quarter ended March 31 were
$44.2 million, or 29 cents per share, compared with $76.6 million,
or 54 cents a share, for the same period last year. Revenues
dropped to $1.49 billion from $1.61 billion.
   Steel profits fell from $87.1 million to $41.1 million while
earnings from missile and electronics slipped from $6.6 million to
$6.2 million. Energy products income grew from $1 million to $1.7
million.
   The aircraft products group, which makes parts of the B-2
stealth bomber, lost $4.3 million in the quarter, compared with a
$25.1 million loss last year.
   Chairman Raymond A. Hay said the decline in steel profits was
caused by higher costs, lower selling prices and lower volume.
   LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy code in 1986 and plans to emerge as a much smaller
company, although no reorganization plan has been filed. LTV
already has sold off much of its steel operations.
   The bankruptcy filing also is the basis for a key Supreme Court
case over the company's claim that it cannot afford to pay pension
benefits, leaving the federal insurance fund Pensions Benefit
Guaranty Corp. liable for $2.3 billion.
   A decision on that case is expected by the end of June, Hay said.

<TEXT>
   The Travelers Corp. on Monday reported a
6 percent drop in first-quarter net income, citing soft market
conditions in the property-casualty business.
   The insurance giant reported first-quarter net income of $92
million, or 87 cents per share, compared to $98 million, or 96
cents per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Total revenues for the quarter ended March 31 were $3.2 billion,
the same as a year ago.
   Net investment income fell $9 million to $860 million. Premiums
were $2.1 billion, compared to $2 billion for the same quarter a
year ago.
   Net income for the property-casualty commercial lines was $42
million, compared to $56 million for the first quarter a year ago.
Premiums were $833 million, compared to $860 million for last
year's first quarter.
   ``We believe the long-term outlook for property-casualty
commercial lines is excellent,'' said Edward H. Budd, chairman and
chief executive. ``We are managing through this cycle with steady
increases in prices, and are strengthening further our
relationships with producers and customers with strong loss control
services.''
   Property-casualty personal lines posted a net loss of $4
million, compared to net income of $7 million a year ago. Premiums
rose to $409 million, compared to $398 million a year earlier, as
price increases offset a decline in the number of policies written.
   Net income for the managed care and employee benefits nearly
doubled to $22 billion, compared $12 million in the first quarter
of 1989.
   Net income for the asset management and pension services was $29
million, compared to $14 million for the first quarter of 1989.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed slightly lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid profit taking after last
week's big gains. Wheat futures rose strongly on frost fears while
corn futures ended mixed.
   Soybean futures surged more than 30 cents a bushel last week,
partly on speculation that last week's hot, dry weather might set
the tone for the growing season.
   The drought fears were dispelled, though, by National Weather
Service Forecasts for cooler, wetter weather in the region this
week and normal to above-normal rainfall in the Midwest from May
through July.
   ``The main feature was a little profit-taking,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a grain futures trader with Dean Witter Reynolds in
Chicago.
   Wheat futures prices rose amid concerns about the possibility of
freezing temperatures in the Central Plains this week, although
many do not expect temperatures to fall enough to significantly
damage the Kansas winter wheat crop.
   The Agriculture Department's weekly export inspections report,
released after the close, indicated last week's loadings of wheat
and soybeans for export were above market expectations, which could
prompt some buying in those markets on Tuesday.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2 cents to 5\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.72{ a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to 1\ cents higher with May at $2.81\ a bushel; oats
were 1{ cents to 3 cents higher with May at $1.65\ a bushel;
soybeans were 1{ cents to 3 cents lower with May at $6.33 a bushel.

<HEAD>Texas Air Subsidiary Reports $21.3 Million First-Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines on Monday reported
first-quarter earnings of $21.3 million, vs. a loss of $16.5
million in the same period a year ago.
   Continental, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., said
revenues in the January-to-March period were $1.27 billion, up
slightly from $1.24 billion the previous year.
   ``In an environment of higher fuel costs and substantially
worsened results being reported by most airlines, we are very
gratified with Continental's first quarter results,'' Frank
Lorenzo, chairman of both Continental and the parent company, said
in a statement.
   ``These results continue to reflect the progress made by our
employees in providing our premier product, and augurs well for
continued product and financial improvement in the 1990s.''
   Texas Air also owns Eastern Airlines, which has been functioning
under bankruptcy court protection since employees struck in March
1989.
   On April 18 a federal bankruptcy judge seized control of Eastern
from Texas Air, partly because of what he called the parent
company's mismanagement of the airline. Eastern is now run by a
court-appointed trustee.
   Continental noted the latest results included special items
totaling $69.7 million, which it described as litigation settlement
proceeds. Special items in the year-ago period were $30.6 million.
   Continental normally reports its earnings as part of the
quarterly financial statement of Texas Air.
   But spokesman Art Kent said Monday the Texas Air financial
report was being delayed while company officials assess the effect
of the bankruptcy court's decision to take control of Eastern.
   ``We don't know where we are in terms of the deconsolidation of
Eastern,'' Kent said.

<HEAD>Venture to Be Formed to Distribute U.S. Bond Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trade association of bond dealers has
announced plans for a joint venture to supply prices 24 hours a
day, responding to a longstanding government request for improved
distribution of market information.
   Among those eligible to participate in the joint venture are 44
primary dealers and seven interbroker dealers, said the Public
Securities Association.
   Within 60 days of formation the venture could begin to
disseminate price information, said PSA general counsel Fran
Bermanzohn.
   Primary dealers buy and sell government bonds and participate in
Treasury auctions; interbroker dealers execute trades for
securities firms but not for the general public.
   The move was overwhelmingly approved by the PSA's primary
dealers committee last Friday at a meeting in White Sulphur
Springs, Va.
   The jointventure would negotiate to sell the data to several
electronic information systems. Currently, brokers get bond quotes
from financial data services such as Telerate Inc. and Reuters
Holdings PLC, among others.
   The government has been pressuring brokers to make price
information more widely available to the public. The General
Accounting Office made the recommendation several years ago.
   The joint venture ``is being done in large measure in response
to a regulatory mandate,'' Bermanzohn said. ``Many dealers take the
position that the (price) information is already out there.''
   The prices available from the venture would be ``real time''
quotes, which show the last sale price as trades are executed
between dealers.
   ``The group decided that the best prices would be from the
industry as a whole as opposed to any group forming together to
provide a number,'' said Thomas Pura, who chairs the PSA's
goverment and federal agency division.
   Many providers of bond prices have exclusive arrangements with
interbroker dealers. Telerate, for example, has a multiple year
contract with the Cantor Fitzgerald brokerage to provide exclusive
quotes on Telerate screens.
   The Associated Press has a similar arrangment with Bloomberg
Financial Markets, which in turn is supplied by Merrill Lynch.
   Pura noted that while the price information currently available
is ``very good,'' the new system will provide even more information.
   ``Will they be significantly different? No, but people feel
better having broader access to price information,'' Pura said.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. is negotiating with Mitsubishi
International Corp. on a deal to put a stamping plant next to the
U.S. automaker's assembly factory in Bramalea, Ontario, the company
said Monday.
   If the deal is struck, it would put a highly advanced stamping
facility at the plant, which is likely to make Chrysler's next
generation of midsize cars, code named the LH and LX.
   Chrysler spokesman Alan Miller confirmed a report in the weekly
journal Metalworking News that the two automakers were negotiating.
But he declined to confirm or deny a report in the journal that
Mitsubishi would equip the plant.
   ``Chrysler will operate the stamping facility and Mitsubishi
will provide technical support,'' Miller said, declining to say if
technical support meant stamping presses.
   Metalworking News quoted unidentified U.S. pressmaking company
executives as saying they were disappointed that Chrysler would
turn to its main Japanese partner for the plant's presses.
   Recently, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has been on a six-city
tour touting the company's vehicles, saying they were just as good
as Japanese cars.
   The LH-LX project is to produce a car by 1992 for the 1993 model
year.

   Hershey Foods Corp. said Monday its
first-quarter earnings rose 18.6 percent, buoyed by sales of

   Company officials said earnings for the quarter that ended April
1 rose to $47.1 million, or 52 cents per share, up from $39.7
million, or 44 cents a share, in the same quarter in 1989.
   Sales rose 19.1 percent to $681.2 million from $572.2 million a

   Richard A. Zimmerman, Hershey's chairman and chief executive,
said sales were spurred by the performance of Hershey Chocolate
U.S.A. and the Hershey Pasta Group, along with the acquisition in
February of Ronzoni Foods Corp.
   Lower costs also contributed to the record performance, he said.
   Hershey also announced plans to buy back about 1.4 million
shares of common stock and to use the shares to pay future costs of
employee benefits.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer Associates International Inc., one of
the world's largest computer software makers, said Monday it will
standardize its products to make it easier for companies to use any
of them on any brand of computer.
   Computer Associates, based in Garden City, N.Y., has grown
primarily by acquiring other software makers. In the process, it
has acquired a hodgepodge of products.
   The company said it will work to standardize is products so that
software made specifically for one brand of computer will be able
to work on another brand computer. It gave no timetable for the
changes.
   Computer Associates said the changes will allow a company with
several brands of computers to choose an applications program, such
as a spreadsheet program, that will work on all the machines. Such
portability of programs is becoming increasingly important as
companies link their computers in networks.
   As part of its new strategy, Computer Associates said it will
adhere to software standards established by International Business
Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., as well as other
industry standards. IBM and Digital are the largest and
second-largest computer makers in the world.

   The federal Environmental Protection
Agency plans to let automakers keep counting big, gas-gulping cars
as imports _ no matter where the car is assembled, EPA
Administrator William Reilly said Monday.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have used the provision
to raise their domestic corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, by
changing the manufacturing site of some major components in large
cars and counting them as part of the company's import fleet.
   ``I don't wish to signal any substantive change in approach (on
CAFE) at this time,'' Reilly said at a news conference before
addressing the Economic Club of Detroit.
   Domestic and import fleets are counted separately under CAFE
regulations. The amount of domestically made components determines
if a car is counted in the domestic or import fleet.
   For instance, Ford planned last year to make the 1991 models of
its Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis, built in St.
Thomas, Ontario, count in the company's domestic CAFE fleet as
their domestic content dropped below 75 percent.
   Such a switch would have made it easier for Ford's domestic
fleet to meet CAFE regulations by increasing the percentage of more
fuel-efficient cars on its domestic fleet. Ford's imported cars far
surpassed CAFE requirements, leaving room for the less
fuel-efficient cars.
   Ford spokesman Dick Judy said Monday those plans changed and for
now, the cars remain in the domestic CAFE column.
   The current CAFE standard is 27.5 mpg for both fleets.
   Reilly was in town for two days of meetings with automotive
industry executives, officials of the United Auto Workers union and
EPA officials in Ann Arbor, where the agency operates its Motor
Vehicle Emissions Laboratory.
   During the news conference and in a speech to the Economic Club,
Reilly pitched the Bush administration's Clean Air proposals and
praised an oil company's plan to buy, for $700 each, cars made
before 1971 when the government began regulating tailpipe emissions.
   ``The faster you replace the older cars with new ones, the
faster you'll clean up the air,'' he said. However, Reilly added
that addition measures are needed to cut tailpipe emissions because
so many new cars have been added to the highways and cars are being
driven more.
   Automakers have balked at further cutting emissions, saying that
it would be very expensive while yielding only minor pollution
decreases.

   The dollar ended mixed Monday against key
foreign currencies in thin, abbreviated worldwide trading.
   Gold prices declined here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for May
delivery settled at $368.40 a troy ounce, down $2.70 from late
Friday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $368.70 an ounce, down $2.80.
   Currency dealers said trading was quiet, with Japanese markets
closed for a national holiday. Many European markets will be closed
Tuesday for May Day, and some dealers took an early, extended
break, they said.
   ``With all the various holidays this week there doesn't seem to
be any reason to break from the trading ranges,'' said Trevor
Woodland, chief corporate trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
``Everybody is in a bit of a wait-and-see mood.''
   Woodland said traders were marking time in anticipation of
several key economic and political events set for this week.
   The U.S. government, for instance, plans to release reports on
March construction spending, the March index of leading economic
indicators, and April unemployment _ data which traders hope would
shed more light on the direction of the economy and interest rates.
   On Wednesday, the Treasury also announces its quarterly debt
refunding.
   Overseas, traders are expected to pay close attention to the
local government elections in Britian as a test of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's controversial reform of local taxes. The
elections could effect the British pound.
   In West Germany, Bundesbank officials are set to meet this week,
although traders said it was unlikely they'll move to raise
interest rates in that country. Higher rates tend to support a
currency.
   In London, the dollar fell to a closing 158.85 Japanese yen from
159.08 yen at Friday's close in Tokyo. The dollar stood at 158.90
yen in New York, down from 159.30 yen Friday.
   The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling
sold for $1.6390 in London, up from $1.6360 late Friday, and for
$1.6405 in New York, up from $1.6350.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday
quotes, included: 1.6795 West German marks, up from 1.6775; 1.4530
Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6330 French francs, up from 5.6290;
1,230.50 Italian lire, up from 1,230.00; and 1.16435 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.16375.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday's rates: 1.6787
West German marks, up from 1.6755; 1.4512 Swiss francs, down from
1.4560; 5.6335 French francs, up from 5.6240; 1.8884 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8845; 1,230.50 Italian lire, up from 1,228.00,
and 1.1649 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1632.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $367.75 an ounce from
$370.75 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $367 an ounce from
$370.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold lost 37 cents to close at a bid
$372.55 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.932 a troy ounce, up 1.5 cents
from late Friday. But silver fell in London to $4.92 an ounce from
$4.95.

   Ames Department Stores Inc., which filed
for federal bankruptcy protection last week, on Monday replaced its
chief executive officer with a merchandising veteran likely to trim
staff and close stores to revive the ailing discounter.
   Stephen L. Pistner, former chairman at Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. and
president at Dayton-Hudson Corp.'s Target discount stores, was
named by the board of directors to replace Peter B. Hollis, who
resigned as CEO and vice chairman.
   Pistner also will become chairman if his appointment is approved
by a New York bankruptcy court.
   Pistner, 58, is known as a decisive, intelligent businessman who
pioneered the concept of power departments _ stores within stores
that specialize in particular kinds of merchandise like clothing or
major appliances, said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of a New York
retail consulting firm.
   ``He's a hard-nosed businessman and a very well-respected
retailer who will probably use an ax rather than a butter knife on
Ames,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of a monthly newsletter for
retailers and manufacturers.
   ``It's a very courageous act on the part of the board,'' added
Millstein, who said the appointment will also assuage creditors and
suppliers who are nervous about the company's ability to pay its
bills.
   In a brief interview from New York, Pistner said he would not
close stores or make other major decisions until he evaluates the
company. He said it would take a good 18 months to put it on more
solid financial footing.
   Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., filed for protection from
creditors last Wednesday, listing $1.44 billion in liabilities and
$1.66 billion in assets. It posted a $228 million loss for the
fiscal year ended Jan. 27 and owes $14 million to its largest
creditor.
   The nation's fourth-largest discounter, Ames operates more than
600 stores in 20 states and employs 55,000 people. It has annual
sales of more than $4 billion.
   Experts trace its problems to the 392-store Zayre chain, which
Ames bought in 1988 for $788 million.
   Some experts said Hollis must bear some of the responsibility
for Ames' problems because he presided during the Zayre acquisition.
   ``It was time to take Hollis out of the job because Hollis was a
financial man but didn't understand the merchandising that was
necessary to attract customers to the stores,'' said Walter Loeb, a
New York-based retail consultant.
   Davidowitz agreed: ``It's very important for creditors because
the old management simply had no credibility. The creditors have
been hurt very badly, and when people are hurt they want a pound of
flesh and they also want to see new faces.
   ``Steve is a known quantity. He's been successful in retailing
for a long time in visible major jobs.''
   Pistner joined Dayton-Hudson in 1970, taking responsibility for
its Target chain in 1973. He was named president and chief
operating officer of Dayton-Hudson in 1977.
   He left in 1971 to become president and chief executive of
Montgomery Ward. He left Montgomery Ward in 1985 to become chairman
of McCrory Corp., the variety store business owned by
Rapid-American.
   Pistner left McCrory in 1988 and has spent the last two years
pursuing business enterprises, including a joint venture in the
Soviet Union that he would not disclose.

   Energy futures finished mixed Monday and
wholesale gasoline prices sagged amid skepticism that OPEC can
devise a way to curb the cartel's crude production.
   Home heating oil prices were bid sharply higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in trading tied to the May contract's
expiration.
   Home heating oil for May delivery shot up 2.79 cents to 56.53
cents a gallon, adding to Friday's gain of 0.67 cent. Market
analysts said traders bought to cover earlier commitments to sell
the contract. This short covering of the expiring May contract
spurred buying of later months.
   June heating oil, which becomes the near-month contract on
Tuesday, rose 0.70 cent to 51.45 cents a gallon.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, the May
contract for unleaded regular gasoline tumbled 0.95 cent to 60.00
cents a gallon after falling 0.39 cent on Friday. The June contract
fell 0.33 cent to 59.84 cents a gallon. Subsequent months lost
slightly less ground.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $18.54 a 42-gallon barrel, the
same level as Friday when it had gained 7 cents. Contracts for
later delivery posted modest gains.
   And natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.565 per million
British thermal units, up from $1.550 on Friday.
   Energy analysts said the weakness in gasoline prices indicated
the market isn't expecting much from the scheduled May 2 emergency
OPEC meeting.
   James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc., said the season of peak
gasoline demand is approaching. If the market believed OPEC could
bring about a significant supply reduction, prices of gasoline
would have been bid higher, he said.
   Ministers from members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will gather in Geneva on Wednesday to plot a
strategy aimed at shoring up world oil prices.
   The recent price slump is believed to stem in part from
overproduction by several OPEC member states. The ministers are
expected to seek a voluntary cut of 1 million barrels a day in
output during May and June.

   OPEC ministers meet in emergency session Wednesday
in a strategy session to support oil prices, which have fallen
sharply in recent weeks because Persian Gulf members are believed
to be violating output quotas.
   Oil industry analysts speculate the ministers are aiming at
their meeting in Geneva for a voluntary cut of 1 million barrels a
day in output during May and June.
   The quota violators, said to be Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, would bear the brunt of the cut in current
production, they predicted.
   ``I think the market needs to see something at least like that
to sustain prices,'' said Lucy Mullins, an analyst with the London
investment firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd.
   Such a cut likely would only steady prices, because the market
already has strengthened somewhat on hopes the meeting will produce
results, analysts said. Whether such cuts will actually take place
is uncertain.
   ``The actual follow-through in the spot market may be quite
limited,'' said Stephen Turner, an oil analyst with the London
investment firm Smith New Court PLC.
   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, fetched a spot price of $16.45 a barrel in London on
Monday afternoon, up 5 cents from Friday. In the U.S. market, the
benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude settled at $18.54 a
42-gallon barrel Monday, unchanged from Friday's close.
   Analysts estimate the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries currently is producing about 23.5 million barrels a day,
exceeding the ceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day the cartel set
for the first half of the year.
   The 13-nation cartel accounts for a substantial portion of the
world oil market and increasingly influences prices in the United
States, where imports now account for about half the nation's
consumption.
   The OPEC meeting was called April 19 by Sadek Boussena,
Algeria's oil minister and cartel president, because of concern
about an unusually sharp price slide that pushed prices down to the
$15-$16 barrel range, vs. more than $20 earlier in the year. The
meeting is expected to last one or two days.
   The gathering officially is of the eight-member monitoring
committee, which only reviews markets and makes recommendations.
But all ministers are expected to attend, which means a full
emergency conference can be called immediately.
   But the ministers aren't expected to grapple with their official
quotas and minimum reference price of $18 a barrel until they hold
their full, regular midyear conference on June 25.
   Boussena is spearheading intensive contacts among OPEC members
to reach consensus on voluntary cuts before Wednesday, the Middle
East Economic Survey, a Nicosia-based oil industry newsletter,
reported Monday.
   A contentious gathering could have a negative impact on oil
markets.
   The newsletter said the United Arab Emirates, one of the main
overproducers, ``is regarded as the toughest nut to crack, given
the UAE's track record and the easy marketability of its high
quality crude.''
   Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifah Al-Sabah, apparently has
indicated that Kuwait will trim production if other producers do
so, the newsletter said.
   ``Saudi Arabia would probably have a similar position, of
readiness to contribute to an agreed temporary cutback, but not to
go below its current quota,'' it said.
   Analysts say the overproduction has created a glut just as
demand is weakening, which usually happens in the spring prior to
heavy gasoline use during the summer driving season.
   This has prompted the unusually sharp price slide, and sparked
fears that prices will collapse as in 1986, when they fell as low
as $10 a barrel in a glutted market.
   Analysts believe Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil exporter,
is producing about 300,000 barrels a day above its daily quota of
5.4 million barrels.
   The United Arab Emirates is said to producing an estimated 2
million barrels a day, nearly double its 1.095 million-barrel quota.
   Kuwait is believed to be producing some 300,000 barrels a day
over its quota of 1.5 million barrels.
   OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.91 percent, up from 7.78 percent
last week. Another $8.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 8.03 percent, up from 7.91 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.77
percent on March 19, and six-month bills averaged 8.08 percent on
last June 19.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.18 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,800.10 and 8.49 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,594.00.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 8.57
percent last week, up from 8.41 percent the previous week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge extended a court order Monday
barring a Manhattan securities brokerage from penny stock sales
activities that regulators allege are illegal.
   U.S. District Judge Kevin T. Duffy in New York issued an opinion
that temporarily bars Wellshire Securities Inc., two of its top
officers and two former employees from further alleged securities
law violations.
   ``The record is replete with evidence that Wellshire employed
misleading and misrepresentative tactics to defraud its
investors,'' Duffy's opinion said in part.
   A lawyer for Willshire maintained there was ``no fraudulent
activity.''
   Duffy's decision, extended a ban he issued last month in
response to a Securities and Exchange Commission request, which
accused Wellshire of using high pressure and deceptive sales
practices to induce investors to buy risky, over-the-counter
securities.
   Penny stocks are low cost, high risk securities _ usually issued
by new or small companies. The stocks, which sell for as little as
a few cents, are prone to fraud and manipulation because
information about them is hard for investors to obtain and verify.
   In March, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Wellshire
Securities operated as a penny stock ``boiler room'' from July 1988
to the present. Boiler rooms are high pressure sales operations
that use banks of telephones, staffed by sales personnel who use
questionable tactics to persuade investors to buy risky stocks.
   ``We feel it wasn't a boiler room operation,'' said Mitchell
Lampert, attorney for Wellshire Securities. ``My client runs an
honest business, within the confines of the law. He feels there was
no fraudulent activity. We're unhappy that the opinion is issued.''
   The SEC lawsuit charged that Wellshire made exorbitant price
predictions, gave out false information about stocks, made
unauthorized sales and tried to stop clients from selling their
securities when the price rose.
   In one case mentioned in the SEC complaint, a 68-year-old
retiree was persuaded to borrow money from a home equity loan to
buy securities.
   Duffy's decision applied to Wellshire's president, Robert Cohen;
Carol Martino, the firm's executive vice president; Joseph Jenkins
Jr., a former Wellshire broker and Alan Diamond, a former Wellshire
trader.
   Also barred from further alleged securities law violations was
Ventura Inc., a Needham, Mass., leasing company, whose securities
was one of the penny stocks sold by Wellshire.
   Wellshire, with six branch offices in New York, New Jersey,
Florida, Georgia and Germany, has about 50,000 customer accounts
and employs 100 brokers, the SEC said.

<TEXT>
   Multibillionaire Warren Buffett took to the
stage of an ornate, renovated theater Monday to dispense his
financial philosophy spiced with comic asides worthy of the
vaudeville comics who once trod the boards.
   More than 900 people crowded into the main floor and balconies
of the Orpheum Theater for Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s annual
meeting, which is more like a down-home gathering of friends than a
feisty exchange between management and shareholders.
   A brief business session preceded two hours of friendly
questions aimed at chairman Buffett and vice chairman Charles
Munger.
   Berkshire Hathaway, valued at $4.9 billion, is an investment
concern that has holdings ranging from stock in big-name companies
like Coca Cola Inc. and Gillette Co. to interests in a candy maker
and an Omaha furniture mart.
   Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting is considered noteworthy
partly because of the enormous respect commanded by Buffett, who
cultivated the company from a New England textile mill a
quarter-century ago into one of the most successful American
enterprises. Buffet sometimes is called the ``Oracle of Omaha.''
   His company is also followed closely because its stock is among
the priciest. On Monday, it traded at $6,700 a share on the New
York Stock Exchange, up $25 from the Friday close.
   Buffett and Munger sipped Cherry Coke and Diet Coke and munched
on See's candies as they fielded questions ranging from the
possibility of a stock split to Buffett's philosophy of investing
in well-managed companies that he understands.
   Problems with microphones as the meeting got under way prompted
audience laughter as Buffett said, ``Now you see why we don't
invest in technology stocks.''
   Buffett briskly concluded the official business of re-electing
officers with nary a word of dissent or discussion.
   ``With the events of Eastern Europe, this may be the last
bastion of undiluted authoritarianism left,'' said Buffett, 59.
   Buffett said he doubts the company's stock will be split ``in
the unforeseeable future.''
   The company tries to attract a specific type of investor, one
with the same type of long-term investment strategy, Buffett said.
   ``Any way you slice it, it's the same pie,'' Buffett said. ``We
think better people are sitting down to eat that piece.''
   When one shareholder asked Buffett about his view on the Federal
Reserve Bank and interest rates, Buffett turned to Munger.
   ``We don't think a lot about macro economics ... We try to do
something sound,'' Munger said. ``We have no view about interest
rates. We don't know and if we did, it probably wouldn't do us any
good.''
   Asked about the possibility of foreign investments with the
integration of the European Common Market in 1992, Buffett said
Berkshire has no rule against foreign investing. But he said he's
not enthusiastic about it.
   ``We have a $3 trillion equity market in the United States. If
we can't make money there...'' Buffett said.
   If he were asked to help change the securities laws, Buffett
said, he would focus on the tax code, which he said presently
encourages companies to go into debt and influences corporate
behavior.
   ``People stretched on the edge of debt don't behave very well,''
Buffett said.

   Unocal Corp. said Monday its first-quarter
profits fell 11.5 percent compared with results a year ago that
included a $46 million after-tax gain from various natural gas
contract settlements.
   For the January-March quarter, the energy company earned $77
million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $87 million, or 37
cents per share, in first-quarter 1989. Revenue edged up to $2.64
billion from $2.63 billion.
   Unocal Chairman Richard Stegemeier said the latest results
reflected higher worldwide crude oil prices, lower interest expense
and improved shale oil operations. Those positive factors were
partially offset by chemical earnings, which fell to $6 million
from $16 million.

   Blue-chip issues showed signs of recovering from
their recent swoon, but the rest of the stock market managed no
better than a mixed showing in a slow session Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 106.75
points over the past two weeks, recovered 11.71 to 2,656.76.
   The average finished April with a net loss of 50.45 points.
   Declining issues held a narrow edge on advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 732 up, 749
down and 497 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board hit a three-week low of
122.75 million shares, against 130.65 million in the previous
session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues,
including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 148.20 million shares.
   Analysts said worries over rising interest rates and inflation
continued to set the mood on Wall Street.
   Traders were looking ahead uneasily to the Treasury's quarterly
auction of bonds and notes, details of which are to be announced
this week.
   There has been much talk that long-term interest rates, already
at their highest level in nearly a year, may rise further as a new
supply of government securities comes to market.
   The first readings on the state of the economy in April also are
due this week _ a monthly survey of corporate purchasing managers
on Tuesday, and the Labor Department's employment report on Friday.
   Brokers expect these figures to support recent evidence that
business activity has picked up a bit lately.
   International Business Machines ranked as one of the session's
standout performers, gaining 1| to 109 in active trading.
   Chairman John F. Akers said IBM was looking for a substantial
improvement in its results for 1990 and had begun to see the
financial benefits of a restructuring it undertook at the end of
1989.
   Another contributor to the blue chips' strength was Boeing, up 1
at 69}. The company posted higher operating earnings for the first
quarter, declared a 3-for-2 stock split and increased its dividend.
   Elsewhere among the big-name industrials, Philip Morris rose {
to 42; Bristol-Myers Squibb 1 to 56&lsqb;; American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph \ to 40&lsqb;, and Exxon, up \ at 45\.
   Baltimore Bancorp, subject of a $17-a-share bid by First
Maryland Bancorp, jumped 3\ to 15.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.99 billion, or
0.35 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.75 to 181.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.10 to 385.44, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.69 at 330.80.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 2.09 to 420.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 343.10, up .46.

<HEAD>May Be Entitled to Tax Break on $400 Million in Civil Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

   Michael Milken may be entitled to a tax break on
at least part of $400 million the fallen junk bond king is placing
in a government fund to compensate injured investors, legal experts
said Monday.
   Such a deduction may appear startling for an admitted felon _
Milken pleaded guilty last week to six criminal securities and tax
law violations _ but it could be perfectly legal under Internal
Revenue Service guidelines.
   Under his settlement of civil and criminal charges, the former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive agreed to pay $200 million in
fines and $400 million in restitution for investors who can prove
they were defrauded by his activities.
   Presuming that Milken has reported his income faithfully and
complied with federal income tax laws _ and no one says he hasn't _
he already has paid taxes on the $400 million.
   Milken in effect would be returning money that never belonged to
him but on which he has paid Uncle Sam, tax experts said.
   ``That's not too shocking,'' said Marvin A. Chirelstein, a
Columbia University tax law professor. ``It just reverses the tax
consequences. It puts the situation where it's as if it had not
happened.''
   According to court papers, Milken made $1.1 billion from 1983 to
1987. His advisers claim he paid nearly one-half of the amount in
taxes. Milken's net worth has been estimated by Fortune magazine at
$1.2 billion.
   Under the IRS tax code, civil or criminal defendants are not
allowed to deduct fines or penalties paid to the government for
breaking the law. Milken's $200 million fine to the U.S. Treasury
falls under that provision.
   But the code generally allows deductions for the payment of
compensatory damages, as well as fees or expenses incurred in a
legal defense, which can be considered part of normal business
operations.
   However, if the government could prove that the money being
returned was obtained by violating some ``sharply defined public
policy,'' that would open the door to preventing a tax deduction,
experts said.
   How big a tax break might occur? Well, assuming Milken is in the
highest tax bracket, the total could amount to a third of the
restitution fund _ about $133 million. No one involved in the case
believes that will happen.
   But the public appearance that Milken was getting a good deal at
taxpayers' expense might be less than flattering for government
prosecutors who arranged the plea bargain.
   New York tax attorney Michael Saltzman said the argument against
a deduction would be, ``It's supposed to be part of the punishment.
Why would the government be picking up a part of that?''
   No claims have been made against the money by the IRS. Milken
doesn't even have to fork over the $400 million until 60 days after
his scheduled Oct. 1 sentencing. How much actually gets paid out
might not be resolved for years.
   The restitution fund settles allegations by the Securities and
Exchange Commission that included insider trading and other frauds
not included in the criminal plea bargain. Any investor claim is
eligible for a piece of the fund.
   Under the terms of the settlement, any money not dished out to
investors after seven years will be turned over to the Treasury _
and presumably could then be classified as a fine, which would not
be deductible.
   ``It seems to me in Milken's interest to see that as much of
that gets paid out to those who justifiably lay claim to damage,''
said tax attorney Lawrence Feld, chairman of an American Bar
Association panel on civil and criminal tax penalties.
   An IRS spokesman said the law is not clear on what tax
consequences might arise in cases where restitution is not
earmarked for a particular individual. The spokesman, who asked not
to be named, declined to discuss the Milken case. A spokesman for
Milken also declined to comment.
   Barry Goldsmith, SEC desputy chief litigation counsel, said tax
deductibility was not a factor in the Milken settlement. ``Our job
is to get the money,'' he said.

   The Belzberg family of Canada claimed
Monday to have won a seat on the board of Armstrong World
Industries Inc., the company that prompted Pennsylvania's tough new
anti-takeover law.
   The disclosure came at the Armstrong's annual shareholders
meeting just three days after the state enacted the law designed to
stymie corporate raiders.
   Armstrong Chairman William H. Adams said he was confident at
least three of the four incumbent board members seeking re-election
were retained.
   He acknowledged the possibility that the Belzbergs had landed
one spot on the 13-member board, but added it would take until at
least May 11 to get a final vote tally.
   The Belzbergs own a 10.7 percent stake in Armstrong. They have
waged a proxy fight to seat four directors and change company rules
to weaken the board's authority to block a hostile takeover.
   The state law, which took effect immediately, is intended to
discourage corporate raiders by seizing profits from a takeover
attempt, restricting voting rights and preserving labor contracts
if corporate ownership changes hands.
   The law was drafted last year after the Belzbergs declared an
interest in Armstrong, which makes flooring and building materials.
   Armstrong management has declined to meet with the Belzbergs.
The family has criticized the company for supporting the
anti-takeover law and accused management of working against
shareholder interests.
   Armstrong has characterized the Belzbergs as inept managers who
have driven companies virtually into the ground, compromising
shareholder earnings.
   Addressing the meeting, Adams said the anti-takeover law would
not alter the company's relationship with stockholders, but would
deter raiders who ``want to line their own pockets.''
   Adams said the board had adopted a policy ensuring that
stockholder interests would not be supplanted by other constituents.
   The action apparently stems from concerns about the
anti-takeover law, which allows management to put the interests of
employees, suppliers or the community above shareholders in making
corporate decisions, including weighing takeover bids.
   During the meeting, Adams was questioned by only one
stockholder, who asked how much the company had spent promoting the
anti-takeover bill. Adams said he did not have an exact figure, but
that it would be under $500,000.
   When asked why the directors had not met with the Belzbergs, he
said: ``The past operating practices of the Belzbergs were not
encouraging us to meet with them.''
   The proposed changes to the company's bylaws have been held up
in a court challenge and were not on the agenda. But the company
took a non-binding vote to gauge shareholder sentiment. The issue
could be revisited, pending the outcome of the suit.
   One proposal would allow a shareholder or group owning 20
percent or more of the stock to call special shareholder meetings.
The company says shareholders can ask the board to call meetings,
at its discretion.
   Representatives of First City Diversified Inc., a Belzberg
entity, said they believed the changes would pass overwhelmingly.
It was not clear when, or if, the vote would be released.
   First City's assertion that it had seated Michael C. Jensen, a
Harvard Business School professor, on the Armstrong board was based
on its owning more than 10 percent of the company's stock, in
addition to proxies it solicited, officials said.
   Other Belzberg nominees were Richard E. Bennett, chairman of
Scovill Inc.; Greta E. Marshall, general partner of the Marshall
Plan and a former investment manager for the California Public
Employees Retirement System; and Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, a
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
   The incumbent board members seeking re-election were Barbara
Hackman Franklin of Washington, D.C.; Joseph L. Jones of Lancaster;
Robert F. Patton of Pittsburgh; and Harry K. Wells of Towson, Md.

   A Supreme Court decision that states and
individuals have the power to challenge completed mergers on
anti-competitive grounds isn't likely to arouse a storm of attacks
on other done deals, experts said Monday.
   ``Enforcement authorities appreciate the business world just
can't function if transactions can be challenged five and 10 years
later,'' said Georgetown University law professor Robert Pitofsky
after the nation's highest court said it would allow California
officials to try to block the merger of the Alpha Beta and Lucky
grocery store chains.
   But the 9-0 ruling Monday nonetheless was expected to inject
another note of caution into the already wary takeover market.
   The Supreme Court said any opponent of a merger, and not just
the federal government, has the right to sue to force the
divestiture of merged businesses. The decision does not negate the
merger of Alpha Beta and Lucky; it sends the case back to court in
California, where state officials must still prove at trial that
the deal should be blocked.
   Pitofsky said California sought to block the merger because
state officials did not get the support they wanted from the
federal government, which had approved the $2.5 billion acquisition
of Lucky Stores Inc. by Alpha Beta's parent, American Stores Co.,
in 1988.
   California officials contend that if the companies' 600 stores
in the state are combined, consumers would end up paying $440
million extra each year because of reduced competition and higher
prices.
   Despite California's victory, Lawrence J. White, a professor at
the Stern Graduate School of Business at New York University, said,
``I don't think it is going to mean a grand unlocking'' of deals.
   Walter Adams, an economics professor at Michigan State
University, agreed there wouldn't be a flood of litigation to undo
done deals. But he said it's possible that some already-completed
mergers will be challenged on a case-by-case basis.
   In addition, antitrust experts said, future deals likely will
face more scrutiny.
   ``What this does is make the states a major player in mergers,''
said Pitofsky.
   Adams said, ``The state attorneys general have been extremely
active to the extent that they legally could in opposing the merger
wave'' and Monday's ruling gives local officials more ammunition.
   But the decision could have a chilling effect on dealmakers
themselves, forcing them to think twice about proposing a buyout or
merger that they know could run afoul of state officials.
   ``This in itself may do a great deal to slow down the (merger)
movement,'' Adams predicted.
   Adams said a more aggressive stance on antitrust enforcement by
the Bush administration following the more lenient Reagan era could
be behind the Supreme Court's decision.
   ``The cop on the beat is no longer looking the other way,'' he
said.
   The Monday ruling by the High Court was likely to further slow
the takeover business, which has been dealt a series of blows over
the past year. On Friday, for example, the Pennsylvania legislature
enacted the toughest anti-takeover law in the country.
   Perhaps more important, the collapse of the junk bond market
last fall has denied takeover investors access to enormous amounts
of money for acquisitions.
   The risky high-yield bonds, which fueled the takeover boom of
the 1980s, fell out of favor when the $6.7 billion debt-financed
buyout of Federated Department Stores Inc. faltered in September.
   Without junk bonds, takeover activity has dropped off
considerably.

<HEAD>Commodity Futures Regulator to Join NY Mercantile Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert R. Davis, a member of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission since 1984, announced he was resigning
Monday to take an executive position with the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   An economist, Davis was nomiated to the five-member CFTC by
President Reagan. He said he will join the New York exchange as
senior vice president for planning and development.
   In his letter of resignation to President Bush, Davis called the
CFTC ``a model of good government that constructively channeled the
`invisible hand' of the market and avoided laying on the 'dead
hand' of excessive regulation.''
   The CFTC, which oversees the futures industry, has come under
fire in the wake of a major fraud scandal at the nation's two
largest futures exchanges in Chicago.
   Critics in Congress and the administration have suggested
merging the agency with the rival Securities and Exchange
Commission or giving the SEC control over securities-related
futures currently overseen by the CFTC.
   Davis, who has bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees in
economics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute, served as senior
economist for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress before his
appointment to the CFTC.
   He also has served as a financial economist to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and a vice president at the Harris
Bank in Chicago.

   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to kill a
lawsuit against General Motors Corp. stemming from what a lower
court called ``the highly charged environment of large-scale
layoffs.''
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that the fraud and
misrepresentation suit by 32 former employees of a GM subsidiary in
Clinton, Miss., should go to trial.
   Those who sued had been employed at a Packard Electric plant in
Clinton before GM in 1983 began laying off hundreds of workers
there in response to sluggish demand for domestic automobiles.
   In other action, the court:
   _Gave state governments and consumers a potential pocketbook
victory by ruling unanimously in a California case that they may
use federal antitrust law to break up corporate mergers.
   _Let the government force thousands of Transportation Department
employees to take random drug tests. The court, without comment,
rejected arguments that such tests violate privacy rights.
   _Requested the Bush administration's views about Oklahoma's
attempt to collect a sales tax on cigarettes and other items sold
at a convenience store owned and run by an Indian tribe. The court
said it wants to know what Justice Department lawyers think about a
ruling that bars the imposition of such a tax.
   _Agreed to settle a bankruptcy dispute stemming from a fraud
lawsuit against a Kansas City, Mo., businessman. The court said it
will hear an appeal by two men who sued the businessman and are
trying to collect a $525,000 judgment. The case turns on what
standard of evidence applies.
   Car-giant GM negotiated a separation agreement with the
employees' union under which workers could opt for a severance
payment instead of having their seniority and rehire rights
preserved.
   Under the so-called voluntary termination of employment plan,
the 32 Packard Electric employees received payments of between
$10,000 and $22,000 when leaving their jobs.
   Their suit alleges that at meetings to explain the severance
plan, a GM representative said they could be rehired if new jobs
were created. The employees allegedly were told they would have to
apply like everyone else, without any consideration of seniority,
but would be eligible for rehiring.
   New positions opened at the plant in 1985, but the 32
ex-employees were told the severance plan they had chosen made them
ineligible for rehiring.
   The 32 employees sued in federal court, but based their suit on
Mississippi law claims of fraud and misrepresentation.
   Lawyers for GM sought a dismissal, arguing that the proper forum
was the National Labor Relations Board. Even if a court suit were
allowed, GM said, the state law claims would be pre-empted by
federal labor law.
   A federal trial judge and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled against GM.
   The appeals court said the NLRB had no jurisdiction in the case.
It characterized the case as one ``involving alleged promises made
and broken in the highly charged environment of large-scale layoffs
and shifts in the labor market.''
   GM then sought Supreme Court review.
   While the original suit named 32 plaintiffs, Jackson attorney
Richard Roberts III said it has been expanded to include about 50
former employees.
   ``We're delighted,'' Roberts said of the Supreme Court ruling.
``We look forward to proceeding with the lawsuit.''
   He said a trial date was not immediately scheduled and refused
to comment on whether he was discussing a settlement with GM
lawyers.
   John Maciarz, a GM spokesman in Detroit, ``We're obviously
disappointed, but the case has never been tried on its merits.''

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Inventory Control a Factor in Heading Off Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Change in the way manufacturers and others
stock their inventories helped head off a recession at the
beginning of the year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told
a group purchasing managers Monday.
   ``The obvious question is, what went wrong with the recession
forecasts or, more exactly, what went right with the economy? While
analysts can never be certain of such things, there is at least
presumptive evidence that a major reason, perhaps the key reason,
is the marked change in inventory behavior on the part of
purchasing managers in manufacturing and elsewhere,'' Greenspan
said.
   Speaking to the 75th annual conference of the National
Association of Purchasing Management, Greenspan said changes in the
``inventory cycle'' are a factor in driving industrial activity in
the nation.
   The economy began to show pre-recession symptoms in the second
quarter of 1989, Greenspan said. By autumn, the signs pointing to a
recession were more abundant, he said.
   The weakness in industrial activity bottomed out around the turn
of the year, Greenspan said, without spreading to other areas of
the economy.
   ``Most, if not all, past American recessions have been sparked,
or at least aggravated by, large inventory swings,'' he said.
   Modern delivery methods, the use of computers to track inventory
and predict demand, and the availability of goods internationally
have helped prevent the cycle of overstocking and then cutting
back, Greenspan said. That cycle, which in turn forces suppliers to
adjust their production schedules, has not been evident on the
industrial scene in recent years, he said.
   Greenspan said there will be other reductions of goods that
affect the business cycle.
   The number of cars and trucks owned by households and businesses
is adequate now, he said, and sales are likely to reflect primarily
replacement needs and slower growth in the driving-age population.
   In the housing market, the low birth rate of the 1960s and 1970s
means that the building rate in the 1990s will be lower than in the
1980s, Greenspan said.
   Increased interest rates since the first of the year on home
mortgages and difficulty in obtaining credit by segments of the
construction industry have also slowed building, ``but the
difficulties ... should diminish considerably over time as they
secure other financing sources,' he said.
   The volume of imports of merchandise, excluding oil, has
declined in recent months, Greenspan said.
   ``Overall, these indicators point to somewhere between modest
and moderate growth in factory output over the coming year,''
Greenspan said.

<HEAD>Western Union Files Restructuring Plan Amid Mounting Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Union Co., which
pioneered the telegram, on Monday announced a plan to restructure
$530 million in debt in an effort to avoid a bankruptcy court
filing.
   Under terms of the plan, the company would exchange up to $530
million in principal amount of outstanding debt for new debt
securities and common stock. Western Union faces a June 15 deadline
to make a $51 million interest payment.
   Robert Amman, Western Union's president and chief executive,
said in a statement that the plan ``will remove the financial
uncertainty clouding our future.''
   Amman said the plan would allow the compant to ``move forward
with continued growth of our electronic messaging and financial
services in markets where Western Union is the acknowledged
leader.''
   The company took special charges of $603 million in the first
quarter of 1988 in connection with the planned sale of the
company's microwave voice-switching facilities.
   Western Union has gotten out of the business of providing
communications facilities to focus on specialized business and
consumer services, but the company has continued to struggle,
reporting $32 million in losses in 1989.
   Western Union officials told regulators in March that the
company may have to seek bankruptcy court protection if it cannot
meet its debt interest payments.
   In the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Western Union said that without being able to raise additional
funds, it probably would default on the June 15 payment.
   ``This exchange offer would give the company more breathing
room, time to get more focused on operations, which is still
showing losses,'' said Al Casazza, an analyst who follows Western
Union for Moody's Investor Service.
   But Casazza said that even if the plan is accepted, ``there's
still a great uncertainty over whether they'll ever be successful.''
   Leigh Walzer, an analyst for R.D. Smith Inc., said he was more
optimistic about Western Union's chances of success if the
restructuring goes through.
   Under the plan, Western Union also would reclassify outstanding
preferred shares. The plan must first be approved by bondholders.
   ``If they get this under these terms, I would bet they would be
out of the woods,'' he said.
   Western Union said in a March filing with the SEC that if the
restructuring is not approved, the company may seek to raise money
through a public stock offering or by selling assets.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said Monday it signed a
three-year agreement with the National Broadcasting Co. that NBC
executives called the largest commitment any advertiser has ever
made for TV commercial time.
   The automaker and NBC refused to disclose the value of the deal,
but one executive familiar with it and speaking on condition of
anonymity said it was for ``a little less than $700 million.''
   The agreement involves GM advertising for its cars, trucks and
automotive services on prime-time programs on the NBC TV network,
which is the leader in the ratings for that time of the day, and on
its National Football League games starting with the 1990-91
television season this fall.
   It also includes GM advertising on two cable networks in which
the NBC has an interest, the Consumer News and Business Channel,
also known as CNBC, and Sports Channel America. NBC is a subsidiary
of the General Electric Co.
   ``This purchase is the largest commitment made by any advertiser
in the history of television advertising sales,'' Larry Hoffner,
executive vice president for network sales, said in a statement.
   Hoffner said GM will be the exclusive domestic automaker on
NBC's NFL coverage but said no similar exclusivity was given to GM
on any NBC prime-time shows, which include the highly-rated ``The
Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers.''
   The previous largest agreement for advertising time on
television was believed to have involved NBC and American Home
Products Corp., which committed $250 million over several years to
advertising on the network.
   GM spent about $200 million on advertising in all parts of the
day on the NBC network last year, an executive familiar with the
latest deal said.
   ``This involves something close to where they have been,'' the
executive said. ``But now they know where they are going to be next
year and the year after that and that gives them some stability.''
   According to the trade publication Advertising Age, GM was the
third biggest national advertising spender in 1988 at nearly $1.3
billion and was the biggest network TV advertiser at $443 million.
   The company declined to say how much it spends on advertising.
   Phil Guarascio, GM executive director of advertising and
strategic marketing, said in a statement that the agreement with
NBC was ``consistent with GM's on-going effort to get the maximum
value for our advertising expenditures to further the sales efforts
of GM divisions, including Saturn Corp.''
   The new Saturn line of automobiles is expected to go on sale
this fall. Other nameplates in the GM stable are Chevrolet,
Cadillac, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and GMC.
   ``It assures us attractive prices on the most desirable
programming while being sifficiently felxible to accommodate
divisions' strategies and allow for mid-course corrections should
forecast spending plans change,'' Guarascio said.

<HEAD>Effort to Halt IBM Sales in South Africa Fails, But Backers Still
Pleased</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   IBM stockholders refused to order the company
Monday to halt sales and services to South Africa, but backers of
the move nonetheless were claiming a victory in a prolonged battle
with the leading computer company.
   The resolution sponsored by 368 IBM employees and 21 religious
organizations in Europe, Japan and the United States was approved
by 17 percent of the 382.9 million shares voted during the
company's annual meeting.
   To pass the measure would have needed a simple majority. Still,
supporters were pleased because the measure only needed 10 percent
to assure its place on the ballot for the next annual shareholders
meeting. This is the third year the resolution's backers have
succeeded in winning its reconsideration.
   Tom Belz, spokesman for International Business Machines Corp.,
aid IBM sold its South African subsidiary, IBM-South Africa Ltd.,
to employees of the subsidiary in 1987.
   The new company, ISM Ltd. (Information Services Management) is
an independent dealership that sells IBM products, as well as other
computer companies products, to commercial companies in South
Africa, Belz said.
   Jim Leas, an IBM hardware engineer and sponsor of the
resolution, said the 17 percent vote was ``the highest vote ever on
any stockholder resolution in IBM history.''
   Responding to backers during the meeting, IBM board Chairman
John F. Akers said IBM and ISM comply with United States export
regulations and that discontinuation of supplies to ISM would be a
``disservice to our former customers and our former employees.''
   Akers also said that while ``there is nothing in the product
line that we don't sell to South Africa, the resale of IBM products
is controlled by U.S. law.''
   Leas contended IBM has been one of the key supporters of
apartheid in South Africa. He argued sale of IBM products and
services in South Africa strengthens the apartheid system and helps
South Africa remain one of the world's largest arms suppliers.
   Computers are a strategic import for South Africa and IBM has
sold more computers to South Africa than any other country, Leas
argued.
   Belz denied that IBM still does business in South Africa.
   ``We don't sell equipment to the (South African) police, the
military, or to apartheid-enforcing agencies. It's the law,'' Belz
said.
   The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act prohibits the sale of
products to South African apartheid-enforcing agencies, and to any
other companies if the product is to be directly used, or
``embedded'' in a weapon system.
   About 20 of the resolution's backers staged a four-block march
to the assembly hall, then chanted and sang hymns outside before
the meeting began.
   In other annual meeting business, Akers said he expected the
world's largest computer company to substantially improve its
financial performance this year.

<HEAD>Confidence Turned Down in April, Conference Board Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer confidence in the economy fell in April
because of a deteriorating job outlook, erasing an upturn the
previous month, the Conference Board said.
   The business-sponsored research group said Monday that its
consumer confidence index fell in April as consumers were less
positive about current economic conditions and the outlook for the
immediate future. The index is based on a monthly survey of 5,000
U.S. households.
   ``Although the nation's unemployment rate has remained unchanged
for some months _ at slightly more than 5 percent _ the number of
new jobs in March dropped abruptly and sharply,'' said Fabian
Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research center.
That decline ``probably contributed to much of the uneasiness''
found by the survey, he added.
   About 14 percent of respondents to the survey said they expected
more jobs to become available during the next six months, down from
16 percent in the March survey.
   The percentage of respondents who said they felt business
conditions are good slipped to 23 percent in April from 25 percent
in March, and those saying they expect business conditions to
improve slipped to 17 percent from 19 percent.
   The survey also found a drop in plans by consumers to buy new
cars and homes in the next six months, the board said.

<HEAD>EPA: Dioxin Levels in Paper Products Pose No Significant Health
Risk</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDs three grafs with Atlanta demonstration. Also on general
news wires</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee filters, food wrap and other paper
products do not contain enough dioxin to warrant regulation and
pose no significant health concerns, the Environmental Protection
Agency said Monday.
   Nevertheless, the EPA said it expects the paper industry to
further reduce dioxin levels in its products and announced new
regulations to cut dioxin releases into waterways near paper mills
because of evidence of fish contamination.
   The EPA said a ``very small number'' of individuals, whose diets
rely heavily on fish from waters near such mills, may be exposed to
significant additional cancer risk. The agency said it was working
with states to post fishing advisories near some mills.
   A cancer risk analysis from eating fish from waters near
specific paper mills was still being prepared and no breakdown as
to health risks by mills was available. There are 104 paper mills,
operated by 38 companies, that produce bleached paper products.
   Henry Habicht, EPA's deputy administrator, said EPA planned to
issue new permit guidelines for states and tougher effluent
limitations for mills to force industry action. The agency also
said it would curb the use of dioxin-contaminated sludge as
fertilizer near some paper mills.
   Environmentalists have raised concerns about dioxin in paper
products since tests several years ago showed traces of the highly
toxic chemical in bleached wood pulp.
   Dioxin, which is known to cause cancer and birth defects in lab
animals and, in high concetrations, skin disorders in humans, is a
byproduct of the chlorine-based bleaching process. The EPA is under
a court directive to evaluate the dioxin danger in paper products
and take protective measures. The agency lists it as a probable
cause of cancer in humans
   The agency said Monday that an analysis of cancer risks from
exposure to bleached paper items shows risks too low to require
regulatory controls.
   The dioxin levels in paper products that come into contact with
food pose at most an aggregate cancer risk of no greater than 2.4
cancers for every 1 million people exposed. For such products as
milk cartons and coffee filters, the risks are less than one in 1
million, the EPA said.
   The agency routinely uses the one-in-1-million-risk threshold as
a benchmark for possible regulatory action in cases involving
cancer-causing chemicals in food products.
   Habicht said the risks for some paper products were somewhat
greater than one in 1 million. But he said no regulatory action is
needed because contamination levels still were extremely low. He
said the agency intends to press the paper industry ``to reduce
those levels even further.''
   Jim Benson, acting administrator of the Food and Drug
Administration, said the dioxin level in foods from bleached paper
``is not a major health problem'' but the FDA wants the level
reduced to zero.
   Red Caveny, president of the American Paper Institute, said the
industry has greatly reduced the dioxin levels in paper products
over the last 18 months by changing the bleaching process. He said
dioxin levels in milk cartons and coffee filters already are so low
they cannot be distinguished from ``background'' dioxin levels
already found in foods.
   ``We have been able to reduce the levels (of dioxins) almost 50
percent in the last two years,'' he said in an interview. He
maintained the improvements have made some of the data used in the
EPA analysis out of date.
   EPA officials said the greater dioxin concern stems from
releases of the chemical from mills into waterways.
   The agency said tests on fish caught downstream and a few miles
from some of the mills had dioxin levels great enough to pose as
much as a one-in-1,000 cancer risk to people eating large amounts
of such fish. Habicht said the health concerns are confined to a
``very small number of people'' whose diet consists of large
amounts of locally caught fish near some of the mills.
   There is no indication of any problem with commercially caught
fish, he said.
   In Atlanta, two activists affiliated with Greenpeace climbed 150
feet up the Georgia-Pacific Corp. building and unfurled a banner
reading, ``Take the Poison Out of Pulp,'' calling for an end to the
chlorline bleach process. Georgia-Pacific is a major paper
manufacturer.
   Beth Zoffman, a company spokeswoman, pointed at the two climbers
and said, ``This creates a far greater risk than the entire
production of dioxin in pulp. They are creating an unnecessary risk
to themselves and the people on the ground.''
   Police said the pair would be charged with criminal trespass and
reckless conduct.

<HEAD>Spanish-Language Network Discloses Plans for Infotainment Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Spanish-language television network
Telemundo and consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble are
launching a half-hour program in which Procter's products will be
prominently featured as solutions to a variety of common domestic
problems, the companies said Monday.
   The show is called Hablando and will appear on the Telemundo
network twice a week starting Tuesday afternoon.
   The Telemundo network is one of the nation's largest
Spanish-language TV networks, reaching 36 major markets and an
estimated 78 percent of the Hispanic housholds in the United States.
   Telemundo Productions, which is producing the show, described
the program as ``infotainment,'' or a mixture of education,
information and entertainment.
   The show features three actors and guest appearances that
portray people in a variety of settings including the kitchen and
the laundry room.
   Procter &amp; Gamble brands such as Luvs diapers, Scope mouthwash
and Tide laundry detergent are prominently displayed and used
during various segments of the program in which topics such as
caring for the baby, personal hygiene or cleaning the family wash
are discussed.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is also the sole national advertiser on the
program, pitching many of the same products that appear within the
show in the four minutes of network commercials allowed each half
hour.
   Critics of ``infotainment'' or ``infomercials'' say shows that
pitch specific products in return for a fee from the manufacturer
are inappropriate because viewers may mistake them for
independently produced programs.
   But Saul P. Steinberg, chairman, president and chief executive
of Telemundo Group Inc., defended the arrangement with Procter &amp;
Gamble, saying that such associations are common on television in
Spanish-speaking countries.
   He said the program provides useful information on local customs
for people who may have only recently arrived, and that it would
have been a much more expensive undertaking without Procter &amp;
Gamble's sponsorship.
   Viewers will be the judge of the value of the program, Steinberg
said, saying it will survive for long if its ratings are poor.
   Nonetheless, he added that ``you can only do so much of this''
and wants a large majority of independent entertainment programming
on his network.
   Neil M. Comber, manager of target marketing for Cincinnati-based
Procter &amp; Gamble, said his company paid a premium of about 5
percent to 10 percent over the costs of commercials alone for the
right to have its products used in the program.
   He said the company also recently began sponsoring two-minute
informative programs that are being carried on Telemundo's
Spanish-language network rival, Univision. Those programs, which
air several times a day on Univision, are produced in conjunction
with the Spanish-language magazine La Familia de Hoy, published by
Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn.

   About 102,000 Mitsubishi cars from the 1986
model year are being recalled because they exceed federal standards
for carbon monoxide emissions, the Environmental Protection Agency
announced Monday.
   The cars were equipped with 1.5-liter engines and sold as the
Mitsubishi Mirage, Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt, most of them under
the Dodge and Plymouth nameplates, EPA said. Dodge and Plymouth
dealers will handle repairs to those cars, and Mitsubishi dealers
will handle models under than name.
   Cars sold in California, which has different pollution standards
from the rest of the country, are not affected by the recall.
   EPA said dealers will modify the carburetor, recalibrate the
automatic choke and check the secondary air filter for possible
replacement. The work will be done without charge.
   The excess pollution was discovered in the agency's routine
checks, EPA said.

   Torchmark Inc. promised to challenge a
state regulator's order that it halt its proxy fight for control of
American General Corp.
   Tennessee Revenue Commissioner Joe Huddleston said Monday that
Torchmark violated state law with its attempt to elect five
nominees to American General's board of directors on Wednesday in
Houston, where the insurer is based.
   The law says no insurance company or holding company can seek to
control a Tennessee company without prior approval of the state
Department of Commerce and Insurance.
   ``The change in control statutes are a vital part of the
regulatory framework that has developed for the protection of
policyholders' interests,'' American General Chairman and Chief
Executive Harold S. Hook said in Houston. ``We are gratified that
the State of Tennessee has acted to order Torchmark to comply with
the law.''
   Torchmark issued a statement promising to go to court to
challenge the ruling.
   Huddleston said the proxy action required Torchmark to provide
financial and other detailed information on which the state can
base its approval or rejection of a takeover. American General and
the state argue that the proxy move by Torchmark Inc. of
Birmingham, Ala., amounts to a takeover which requires approval of
Tennessee.
   Torchmark contended during a two-day hearing last week that its
actions do not require it to meet the requirements because a
successful proxy fight would simply put directors on the board
willing to discuss a takeover.
   Torchmark officials also wrote Gov. Ned McWherter on April 13 to
advise him, among other things, ``that we have no plans to move any
operations out of Tennessee.''
   Tennessee is one of 10 states in which American General is
considered domiciled because of its operations there. Regulators in
Texas and New York also have questioned the legality of Torchmark's
proxy solicitation. Missouri, California and Virginia have approved
the process.
   Torchmark turned to the proxy strategy earlier this month after
American General turned down its takeover bid of $50 a share in
cash and $50 worth of Torchmark stock.

<TEXT>
   Northeast Utilities has appointed a new
team of senior managers to take over the running of bankrupt Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire, operator of the long-delayed Seabrook
nuclear power plant.
   Northeast, which has bid $2.3 billion for Public Service, also
said it dismissed 15 Public Service middle management employees on
Monday, spokesman Jeffrey Kotkin said. They will remain on the
payroll for 60 days, he said.
   About 50 middle-level managers had been in limbo while Northeast
decided whether to keep them. Kotkin said no other firings are
expected but added, ``there could be changes after the merger is
completed.''
   The Connecticut utility's bid for Public Service still requires
the approval of state and federal regulators.
   Until the takeover is completed, an interim board of directors
will run Public Service, New Hampshire's largest electric utility.
The board elected Leon Maglathlin Jr. president and chief executive
officer.
   Frank Locke, a Northeast senior vice president, will be
responsible for Public Service's day-to-day operations. If
Northeast's bid is approved as expected, Locke will become
president.
   John Duffet, Public Service's former president and chief
executive officer, and four senior vice presidents officially left
the company Monday.
   Locke said several task forces of Public Service and Northeast
employees have begun analyzing the two utilities to determine how
best to operate them once the merger is completed.
   Public Service sought bankruptcy protection in January 1988,
largely because of delays and huge cost overruns at the troubled
Seabrook plant. Northeast's offer was accepted after almost two
years of talks and bidding by various New England utilities.

   Edward M. Esber Jr. quit Monday as chief
of Ashton-Tate Corp., a software maker that has lost money for four
quarters because of problems with the latest version of its core
program, dBase IV.
   No one was named immediately to replace him as chairman and
chief executive. Carmelo J. Santoro, chief executive of Silicon
Systems Inc. and an outside director of Ashton-Tate, was named
non-executive chairman of the board.
   The new operational head of the company will be William P.
Lyons, named president and chief operating officer.
   Lyons, 45, had headed Ashton-Tate's applications group _ its
operations other than the DBase and Rapid File data base products.
The data bases make up three-quarters of its business.
   Esber, 37, known more as a marketer than as a technical expert
or day-to-day adminstrator, will concentrate on ``customers,
products and strategies'' as vice chairman, the company said.
   Critics blamed Esber for allowing Ashton-Tate to lose its
leadership in PC software and for a series of disappointing new
products and acquisitions.
   The dBase IV program introduced in October 1988 was marred with
errors, and some customers complained it was slow and too prone to
crash. Esber promised an improved version, but 18 months later it
is still being tested.
   ``We haven't set a date (for its release) but we are very
pleased with its progress,'' Ashton-Tate spokeswoman Delia
Fernandez said.
   Ashton-Tate is based in Torrance, a Los Angeles suburb.

<HEAD>Boeing Reports Strong First Quarter, Continuing Worries Over
Defense</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `The 1989 ...' to CLARIFY that accounting
change produced one-time gain.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co., which is selling more planes and
making more on them, said Monday its sales jumped 60 percent and
its profits 87 percent in the first quarter of 1990.
   Company officials said demand should remain high for Boeing's
jetliners, and hinted strongly they would go ahead with their
planned new jet, the 777. But they warned shareholders at their
annual meeting to expect another losing year for Boeing's troubled
defense and space segments.
   Boeing announced a three-for-two stock split, the second year in
a row it has done so.
   Shareholders gave directors permission to issue more stock but
rejected a request that Boeing stop doing business with South
Africa, despite efforts by a Baptist minister who camped in a
plywood shack in front of company headquarters for three days and
urged holders to ``do the right thing.'' They also turned down
three ``shareholders' rights'' resolutions, including a call for a
shareholder vote on the company's ``poison pill'' plan.
   Boeing earned $302 million or $1.31 a share on sales of $6.4
billion for the first three months of 1990, compared with profits
of $161 million or 70 cents a share on sales of $4 billion in the
first quarter of 1989.
   The 1989 figures are before a restatement to reflect a change in
accounting for income taxes, which produced a one-time gain of $298
million or $1.29 a share. With the gain, earnings in the 1989
quarter were $459 million or $1.99 a share.
   Boeing was left with a number of nearly complete planes when
production was virtually stopped by a 48-day Machinists union
strike last fall. As a result, it was able to deliver 84 jets in
the first quarter, compared with 67 in first-quarter 1989.
   Deliveries included 22 747-400 jumbo jets, Boeing's largest and
most expensive plane worth about $125 million each. Just five 747s
were delivered in the first quarter of 1989, when Boeing was
struggling to introduce the new-model 747-400.
   Frank Shrontz, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
higher profits resulted from increased sales and improved operating
margins on commercial jets. Higher federal taxes and losses in
other segments of the company partially offset that performance, he
said.
   Last year, Boeing's military and space divisions lost $474
million. Boeing has bid aggressively on defense and space contracts
in recent years and fallen behind on several programs. At the
beginning of the year, it consolidated its military work into
Boeing Defense and Space Group to try to make the segments more
efficient.
   Shrontz said progress had been made but continuing technical,
cost and schedule problems would result in another operating loss
in 1990.
   Boeing didn't release figures on how large the defense loss
might be. But George Shapiro, analyst with Solomon Brothers in New
York, said his estimate was about $150 million to $200 million.
   Boeing is coming to the end of some troublesome programs, such
as the long-delayed new Air Force One jets, and isn't getting any
new programs that could cause further losses, Shapiro said.
   Last week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed cutting or
delaying two key programs for Boeing, the B-2 stealth bomber and
the Advanced Tactical Fighter. Boeing is a major subcontractor on
the B-2, with 10,000 employees assigned to the project, and is
competing for the multi-billion dollar contract for the Air Force's
new-generation warplane.
   Dan Pinick, Defense and Space Group president, said ``watershed
events'' in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have led Boeing to
anticipate a 5 percent decline in the Defense Department budget
through 1995.
   ``Clearly we don't know exactly what the future budget levels
will be but given the recent events, we believe that we should make
business decisions based on a more conservative estimate,'' Pinick
said.
   Dean Thornton, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group,
got to deliver a much cheerier speech. Noting that 57 customers
ordered 963 Boeing planes worth $47.5 billion last year _ the fifth
straight year of record orders _ Thornton remarked, ``We're getting
to numbers that I can't hardly relate to.''
   Boeing has cranked up its production rate from 24 planes a month
in 1988 to 28 in 1989, and plans to be at 34 a month later this
year, Thornton said. By mid-1991, the rate will be 38 month, he
said, and Boeing is considering going to 41 a month in 1992.
   ``In addition to increasing production on current programs, we
plan to introduce the new 777 airplane in that time frame,''
Thornton said.
   Boeing hasn't officially launched the 777, a two-engine widebody
that would carry 350 passengers, but has been talking with airlines
and firming up its design. No airlines have announced orders for it
yet, but Shrontz told reporters the company hoped ``to have reached
a quantity that would allow us to launch it'' by mid-year.
   Boeing had a firm backlog of $84.1 billion in unfilled orders as
of March 31, compared with $80.6 billion at the end of 1989. All
but 8 percent of that was for commercial customers.

<HEAD>Wells Fargo Chairman Predicts Restructuring of Banking Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Wells Fargo Bank predicted
that troubles at the nation's banks and thrifts will force a
radical restructuring and consolidation of the financial services
industry.
   ``Reform, radical structural reform ... is the only sane
alternative,'' the banker, Carl Reichardt, said Monday. ``It's the
only safe road.''
   He predicted that reform eventually would establish a single
regulatory body to oversee the industry and remove competitive
barriers between banks, securities firms and insurance companies.
   Reichardt, who made his remarks before a gathering of the
Society of American Business Editors and Writers, said the
Resolution Trust Corp., established last year to oversee the
bailout of the thrift industry, has a ``daunting task.''
   The job will entail giving many sick savings and loans ``a
decent burial'' while trying to preserve as much value as possible
in selling off what Reichardt called a ``motley collection of
assets.''
   Complicating the effort are the RTC's ``Byzantine''
organizational chart and the 371-page law that governs its work,
Reichardt said. He called potential buyers ``bottom fishers ... who
are the shrewdest buyers in the country.''
   He urged banks to improve credit quality and chastised big banks
for failing to have credit training programs. He said that was akin
to ``trying to run an engineering company with poets.''
   ``As in so many industries, the opportunities lie in executing
the basics well,'' he concluded.
   Earlier, John F. McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
said booming orders for commercial aircraft and new markets in
space will help the aerospace industry weather cuts in defense
spending.
   ``The U.S. defense budget does not represent a vein of gold to
be mined for social programs,'' McDonnell conceded.
   Rather, developments in Eastern Europe and elsewhere represent
enormous potential for increased commercial aviation as tourism and
business opportunities grow, he said.
   Defense cuts have renewed enthusiasm for space exploration and
transportation, McDonnell said, adding that ``prospects in this
part of our business are looking better than at any time since the
1960s.''
   The recent layoff of 3,000 workers by the Douglas Aircraft unit
in Long Beach, Calif. was ``not a retrenchment,'' McDonnell said.
Some workers will be transferred and others were let go because
they did not have the necessary skills. But the overall picture
remains healthy, he said, adding that the division hired 10,000
workers last year.

   The dollar fell marginally against the yen Tuesday
morning and share prices slipped on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
slack trading.
   The dollar was changing hands at 159.05 yen at late morning. It
opened at 159.09 yen, up 0.01 yen from last Friday's close, and
ranged narrowly between 159.00 yen and 159.11 yen during morning
trading.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 45.21 points, or 0.15
percent, ending the morning session at 29,539.59. The index had
gained 160.22 points last Friday.
   Tokyo markets were closed Monday for a national holiday and
holidays later this week kept activity very thin Tuesday, said
Tomoya Kohda, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``Today's trading is so quiet and boring,'' he said.
``Participants will just remain on the sidelines for the rest of
the day and tomorrow.''
   Many Japanese companies are taking a long ``Golden Week'' break,
stretching a series of holidays between last Saturday and next
Sunday into one continuous vacation. Markets are open only on
Tuesday and Wednesday before the four-day weekend starting
Thursday, which is Constitution Day.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said currency
trading was very quiet. Adding to the market's inactivity was the
scheduled closure later Tuesday of most major European markets for
May Day, he said.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds
fell to 85.71 from last Friday's close of 85.83. That boosted the
yield to 7.43 percent from 7.405 percent.
