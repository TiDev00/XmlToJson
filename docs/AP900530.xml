<HEAD>New York Republicans Open Convention By Taking Abortion-Rights
Stance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RYE BROOK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Republicans opened their state
convention Tuesday and approved an abortion-rights platform without
debate.
   The plank states that ``state government must not become a `big
brother,' regulating people in their personal affairs and lives.''
   ``The New York state Republican Party reaffirms its historic
commitment to the right of privacy and reproductive rights,'' it
says.
   U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who delivered the keynote address at
the convention, later told reporters that ``the platform should
have been neutral. ... Now you have a position that's pro-choice.
Why?''
   State Assemblyman George Pataki, chairman of the Republican
platform committee, said the stance should be considered ``all
encompassing'' and conceded that the plank ``is a break with the
national platform which is strong right-to-life.''
   The plank was the first test of the party's new leadership at
the convention. J. Patrick Barrett took over as party chief less
than a year ago.
   Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo has made it clear that he plans to
use his position in favor of abortion rights as a weapon against
Republicans this year in his bid for re-election.
   Pierre Rinfret, a 66-year-old Canadian-born economist who has
never run for public office, is expected to be named the Republican
gubernatorial candidate.
   According to party leaders, he supports a woman's right to an
abortion.

<HEAD>House Fails to Override School Finance Veto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days before a court-ordered deadline,
Texas again failed to overhaul its finances to give more money to
poor schools, but Gov. Bill Clements says the state actually has
three weeks to get the job done.
   The House, in a largely party-line vote Tuesday, failed by eight
votes to muster the 100 needed to override Clements' veto of a $555
million school-finance bill. The House then adjourned. The Senate
voted last week for an override.
   The Democrat-controlled Legislature had designed the bill to
answer a unanimous Texas Supreme Court order to give more money to
poor schools. If a measure is not enacted by Friday, a
court-appointed master will come up with a plan.
   ``I think a compromise will be reached that will be acceptable
to everybody concerned and will be an excellent bill,'' the
Republican governor said. ``I think in a matter of another week
we'll have it all done and everybody can go home and have a good
time.''
   House Speaker Gib Lewis said he expected Clements to call
lawmakers back for a fourth special session on school finance as
early as today.
   ``We will continue to negotiate, work with the governor and find
out what issues that we can compromise with him,'' Lewis said.
``One thing I am trying to prevent and I'm going to try the best I
can is not allow a master to write a school plan for the future of
Texas education.''
   Clements has said lawmakers have until June 21 to enact a bill,
because that is when court master William Kilgarlin will file his
final plan for the 3.1 million-student school system.
   In October, the Supreme Court declared Texas' school finance
system unconstitutional because of wide disparities in spending
between rich and poor districts. As in most states, schools in
Texas are supported mostly by property taxes.
   Courts in a dozen states have overturned school finance systems
in recent years. The others are Kentucky, New Jersey, Kansas,
Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia,
Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   In vetoing the bill last week, Clements decried the half-cent
sales tax increase lawmakers want to help pay for the measure.
   Rep. Eddie Cavazos, a Democrat from Corpus Christi, said a
court-written plan is looking more attractive to those who
represent poor districts.
   ``We've done the best we can, and they won't accept it. That's
fine. Let them try to deal with a master,'' said Cavazos, chairman
of the House Mexican American Legislative Caucus.

   Rebounding from a slump last year, private
donations to colleges and universities rose 8.8 percent to a record
$8.9 billion in the 1989-90 academic year, a report says.
   After a 3.5 percent decline in private giving in 1988-89 that
many blamed on the 1987 stock market crash, donations returned to
more normal patterns, according to the report issued Tuesday by the
Council for Aid to Education.
   ``Despite the continued sluggish pace of the economy and
generally poor corporate profits, individual Americans and a
variety of American institutions ... seem willing to sustain their
support of higher education,'' said council president Arnold Shore.
   As it has since 1985-86, Stanford University received the most
contributions of any institution _ $188.6 million.
   The council's national figures are estimates based on survey
responses from 1,132 colleges and universities.
   Among the findings:
   _Alumni contributions rose 12.2 percent to $2.29 billion;
   _Gifts from non-alumni individuals were up 7.8 percent to $2.08
billion;
   _Corporate giving totaled $1.95 billion, up 5.1 percent;
   _Foundation support rose 8.4 percent to $1.74 billion;
   _Religious organizations donated $237 million, up 20.1 percent;
   _Contributions from other sources reached $632 million, up 10
percent.
   Twenty colleges and universities attracted approximately 23
percent of all contributions to higher education, according to the
survey. Following Stanford, those schools were, in order:
   Harvard University, $185.4 million; Cornell University, $157.1
million; Yale University, $122.8 million; University of
Pennsylvania, $121.9 million; Columbia University, $110.4 million;
University of Southern California, $102.6 million; University of
Wisconsin-Madison, $102.2 million; Duke University, $102 million;
University of Minnesota, $100.2 million; Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, $95.7 million; Johns Hopkins University, $84.1 million;
Princeton University, $80.3 million; University of Washington,
$76.4 million; University of Illinois, $73.1 million; University of
California-Los Angeles, $72.8 million; University of Michigan,
$70.7 million; Ohio State University, $68.6 million; Northwestern
University, $68.5 million, and University of California-Berkeley,
$68.3 million.

   The group of Oakland, Calif., medics is known as Heart to Heart,
and to many Soviet families, they are more than an exchange program.
   They are the gift of life to children born with heart defects.
   After her husband's summit meeting with President Bush, Raisa
Gorbachev plans a visit next week to Oakland's Children's Hospital,
Heart to Heart's base.
   More than half the 50,000 children born in the Soviet Union each
year with heart defects die before their first birthdays.
   The Heart to Heart team of doctors and nurses know they
personally can help only a few of those children, but their
educational programs for both medical personnel and parents are
designed to benefit a greater number.
   The group is planning its third trip to Leningrad this fall to
operate on several children and teach more Soviet doctors advanced
heart techniques.
   Earlier this year, 130 families, who had learned of the
15-member team's visit from newspaper stories or friends, traveled
great distances just for the chance to have their children examined
at Leningrad's Children's Hospital.
   The waiting room was a mixture of elation and sadness as some
parents learned their children could be operated on and others were
told their child's condition was inoperable.
   Most of the operations actually are simple, the U.S. doctors
say, just a matter of having the proper training and equipment.
Within days, they say, many of the children are up and around,
showing renewed energy.
   Then nurse Lili Cook can tell those parents, ``From now on, your
children can lead a normal life.''

<HEAD>Antique Dealer Wins Right to Hang Out Queen Victoria's Bloomers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An antique dealer has won a court battle giving
her the right to hang Queen Victoria's bloomers from her market
stall.
   Anne Swift, who runs a store in Portobello Road, London's main
antique shopping area, successfully appealed against a ban imposed
by local councilors.
   ``Could you say Queen Victoria's undergarments have connotations
of dirt and shabbiness?'' Mrs. Swift asked in a London magistrates
court on Tuesday.
   Councilors had banned stalls from selling second-hand clothing
but allowed Mrs. Swift to continue as long as she displayed
garments flat. Mrs. Swift deals exclusively in antique textiles.
   Appealing the order, Mrs. Swift told the court she could not
sell the valuable Victorian garments that way because they would
become creased and damaged.
   Dermot Woolgar, representing the Royal Borough of Kensington and
Chelsea, said the stall was ``a shambles'' and obstructed the view
of other stalls.
   Among the antique lace, needlework and fabrics on sale were
several items said to have been worn by Queen Victoria. The
garments included three camisoles valued at $500 each, one
nightgown at $845, and a pair of bloomers, whose price is available
on application.

   This city is going bonkers over bugs.
   There are nightly updates on the TV news, recipes in the
newspaper, even a special hot line heralding not the coming of the
apocalypse, but the emergence of inch-long critters called cicadas.
   The noisy devils unearth temselves every 17 years to mate,
shriek incessantly, and drive homeowners crazy.
   Millions of the winged creatures are expected to emerge in parts
of Illinois, Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin during the next few days,
covering back yards and forests with their brownish, crunchy bodies.
   After mating and laying eggs that will remain underground for
another 17 years, the cicadas will die. The orgy should be over by
early July, and experts say the creatures are harmless.
   But that hasn't calmed the hysteria.
   ``It's completely unfounded,'' said Field Museum entomologist
Phil Parrillo. ``People are going out and getting insecticide to
spray on them, but they're only going to be here for a few weeks.
Gee whiz, don't worry about it.''
   The males produce a large shrill sound; the females are mute.
   ``They may be a nuisance in terms of the sound that they make,''
he said Tuesday. And they can damage young trees where they lay
their eggs.
   ``Other than that, they're really not going to cause a
problem,'' he said.
   Midwesterners might get a different impression from reading the
newspaper or watching the news lately.
   ``The cicadas have reached Elmhurst,'' a broadcaster announced
in a teaser for a recent television newscast.
   WLS-TV news has run five or six reports ``saying that they're on
their way, and also a story on what people can do to protect their
young trees,'' said Jim Lichtenstein, assignment editor.
   The cover of a recent Chicago Tribune Sunday magazine featured
the warning: ``Get Ready! The 17-year itch of the cicada is about
to begin.''
   The Chicago Sun-Times last week set up a hot line, which has
received at least 60 calls a day from curious or horrified
homeowners with questions about the bugs, said Jim Martinez,
metropolitan editor. The newspaper even printed recipes for readers
brave enough to eat the creatures.
   Michael Kendall, a Chicago attorney, tested one of the recipes
with some cicadas he found Monday night in his brother's suburban
back yard.
   ``We parboiled them and then sauteed them in butter and garlic
and ate them sort of like shrimp,'' Kendall said. ``They taste like
sort of a starchy potato. They had a sort of scalloplike
consistency.''
   Parrillo says this batch of cicadas _ Brood 13 _ lives in the
top third of Illinois, parts of eastern Iowa and western Indiana,
and in southern Wisconsin.
   Other broods, on different 17-year cycles, live throughout the
eastern United States, and some cicadas emerge every 13 years, he
said. He knows of no other periodic cicadas that are appearing this
year.
   ``If people can set aside their insect phobia long enough to
appreciate what's happening ... it's something that I think they
should go out and take a look at,'' said Parrillo, blaming the news
media for helping create cicada mania.
   But the Sun-Times' Martinez said the bugs warrant the coverage.
   ``How often do you have all these little bugs coming out of the
ground, making so much noise, being such a nuisance?'' he asked.
``It's just a fascinating bit of nature that we don't often get a
chance to look at.''

<TEXT>
   Now that the Soviet army has left
Afghanistan, Moslem fundamentalists are turning their wrath on
Western aid agencies and Afghan women who work for them.
   Threats of ``revolutionary action'' against the women issue from
faceless tribunals with mystery memberships and names like Council
of Islamic Jihad, Reformist Movement of Moslem Youth and Mujahed
Brothers. Jihad means holy war and mujahedeen are holy warriors.
   Leaders of guerrilla groups fighting the Soviet-sponsored
government in Kabul deny knowledge of the tribunals, which have
made their presence known through letters warning Afghan women away
from the Western agencies.
   More than 3 million Afghan refugees live in camps around this
frontier town at the foot of the Khyber Pass, the route to
Afghanistan.
   Scores of humanitarian aid groups established headquarters in
Peshawar after the Red Army entered the Afghan civil war in
December 1979 and refugees started streaming into Pakistan. The
last Soviet military forces left last year.
   Letters signed by the groups, written by hand or typed, began
circulating in refugee camps in May.
   One said the aid groups engaged in ``immoral activities, one of
the characteristics and products of Western civilization that is
not proper for Moslem women.''
   A mob of about 5,000 people in the Nasir Bagh refugee camp
attacked operations of Shelter Now International, which is financed
by several Christian groups, causing nearly $1 million in damage.
   Over mosque loudspeakers Moslem clerics exhorted the mob and
denounced Western influence.
   The targets were a sewing center for widows and an elementary
school for girls. Nasir Bagh is considered the showcase of the 250
refugee camps in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province.
   In mid-May, about 100 Afghan men chanting ``Down with
foreigners!'' and ``Death to Afghans who work with foreigners!''
destroyed a concrete factory established by Shelter Now
International in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province.
   A mob attacked the Austrian Relief Committee headquarters in
Peshawar the next day, but did little damage.
   ``Most refugees have nothing to do with this whole business,''
said Ted Albers, a spokesman for an umbrella group of 51 agencies.
   He said rivalries among the seven guerrilla organizations based
in Pakistan had caused much uncertainty but there was no evidence
of a coordinated effort to undermine Western aid programs.
   Much of the foreign aid has gone to Hezb-i-Islami, or Party of
God, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
   Tales abound of how Hekmatyar, known for anti-West rhetoric,
threw acid in the faces and on the arms and legs of unveiled Afghan
women in the early 1970s before fleeing to Pakistan.
   President Najibullah of Afghanistan has emphasized the
fundamentalist element of the rebel groups in his propaganda
campaign against the guerrillas.
   Women in Kabul, particularly teen-age girls, say they fear they
would be forced back into veils if Hekmatyar or Abdul Rasul Sayyaf
came to power.
   Sayyaf, prime minister of the guerrilla government, will not
talk to female journalists and forces Western women to wear
tent-like veils in his presence.
   Gulzar Khan, Pakistan's commissioner for Afghan refugees, would
not say what the government was doing to protect the aid agencies
or their programs for women, but said: ``You can't wish it away.
The problems are there.''
   Afghan women are afraid.
   A young woman concealed in a voluminous shawl glanced around
nervously before hurrying into a walled compound in Peshawar's maze
of alleys.
   She calls herself Farida, fearing to use her real name because
she is on a list compiled by self-appointed protectors of Islamic
purity.
   Farida, 31, runs an elementary school financed by a West German
agency. She has been threatened repeatedly by fundamentalists and
blames radical followers of Hekmatyar. A bomb was found outside the
school in 1984 and defused.
   Hekmatyar denies responsibility for such acts.
   Farida said of the radicals: ``For 10 years I've been with these
people. They are not like humans. Sometimes they call me and say,
`We want to kill you.'''
   What should have been a five-minute drive to Farida's school
took nearly half an hour because she did not want it known that a
foreign journalist was visiting.
   ``I'm afraid, but I take care of myself and I want to give
courage to the girls,'' she said.
   She goes to her school each morning in one outfit and is dressed
differently when she leaves. For two months, she couldn't reach her
home because Afghan men blocked the way.
   Farida opened the school in 1980 with 27 students. She now has
575 girls and 363 boys, taught separately.
   ``My heart wants to help these refugee children,'' she said.
``This is the chance for Afghan children.
   ``The future for women in Afghanistan is very dark. The
difficulties are many.''

   Fox Broadcasting Co. takes dead aim this fall at
NBC's Thursday night dominance, pitting America's most alienated TV
family, ``The Simpsons,'' against the blithe Huxtables of ``The
Cosby Show.''
   ``We believe you have to take risks,'' Peter Chernin, Fox's
entertainment chief, told advertisers Tuesday in previewing the
fall lineup. ``We don't think you can play it safe any longer in
the current network environment.''
   CBS unveiled nine new series after three straight third-place
seasons in prime time. Two are hourlong action dramas, ``The
Flash,'' about the superfast crimefighter from the comic pages, and
network TV's first environmental action show, ``The Green
Machine,'' in which the heroes fight polluters.
   Chernin announced nine new series in Fox's move from three to
five nights of prime-time programming. To make room, Fox cut its
original series, ``21 Jump Street,'' as well as ``Alien Nation,''
``Booker'' and ``The Outsiders.''
   ``The Simpsons'' will take on ratings giant ``Cosby'' on
Thursday night, followed by ``Babes,'' a sitcom about three large
sisters who share a cramped New York apartment and Zip Code dress
sizes.
   Then, at 9 p.m. Eastern time, Fox goes for the younger viewer
with ``Class of Beverly Hills,'' the story of Midwestern teen-age
twins who confront the issues of growing up in the surreal, monied
ambience of Beverly Hills High.
   CBS Entertainment chief Jeff Sagansky, announcing his first full
schedule since he was hired last fall, overhauled all nights except
Tuesday and Sunday, giving the network four nights of comedies.
   CBS' roster includes five new hourlong series; four new sitcoms
and a comedy once on NBC, ``The Hogan Family.'' It also has a movie
package of such hits as ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and ``Do The
Right Thing.''
   Low-rated ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung'' moves to Mondays
as ``Face to Face With Connie Chung,'' but CBS dropped the Vietnam
War series ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Falcon Crest,'' ``The Famous Teddy
Z,'' ``City'' and ``Sydney.''
   Sagansky said the Western ``Paradise'' may be renewed.
``Wiseguy'' is in backup status, he added. Ken Wahl would return in
the first few episodes, then be succeeded by Stephen Bauer as a new
undercover agent.
   CBS' new sitcoms are the movie spinoff ``Uncle Buck,'' the
blue-collar ``Lenny,'' ``Four Alarm Family,'' about a widowed
firefighter with four kids, and ``Evening Shade,'' starring Burt
Reynolds as an ex-football star who moves his family back to the
small Arkansas town of his boyhood.
   Edward Woodward of CBS' late ``The Equalizer'' will return in
the hourlong ``Over My Dead Body'' as a crime novelist paired with
a young obituary writer.
   CBS' other new hourlong entries are ``WIOU,'' a drama about the
cutthroat world of local TV starring John Shea, and ``The
Hammersmiths,'' a drama with Lucie Arnaz about three generations of
a family.
   Fox offers ``American Chronicles,'' a half-hour documentary
series by Mark Frost and David Lynch, creators of ``Twin Peaks,''
and an hour series of various video projects, ``Fox Video Hour.''
   Fox's other new hour show is ``D.E.A.,'' which mixes documentary
and drama about the exploits of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   On Monday's ``Fox Night at the Movies'' the fourth network will
combine theatrical and made-for-TV movies aimed at younger viewers.
   ``We think we're in a real real dogfight out there,'' Chernin
said. ``We think we're in competition not only with the other
netwroks, but also with cable, VCRs, Nintendos and every other
leisure time activity. We've got to go out there and kick and
scream to get viewers.''
   Fox will anchor its Sunday schedule with ``True Colors,'' a
sitcom about interracial marriage that Chernin called ``Fox's
answer to `The Brady Bunch.''' It stars Nancy Walker as an acerbic
mother-in-law.
   It will be followed by ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose,'' high school
adventures with Dobie Gillis and Ferris Bueller overtones; the
sketch comedy of ``In Living Color;'' comedian Chris Elliott in
``Get a Life'' as a 30-year-old newsboy; the miserable Bundy family
of ``Married ... with Children,'' and ``Good Grief,'' about two
brothers-in-law who operate the family mortuary.
   Fox will close Sunday night with ``Against the Law,'' a
courtroom drama starring Michael O'Keefe as ``television's first
gonzo, rock 'n' roll lawyer,'' Chernin said.
   Fox has 129 affiliates, compared with more than 200 each for
CBS, NBC and ABC, but isn't considered a network by the Federal
Communications Commission.
   It is expanding this fall under a one-year FCC waiver that lets
it broadcast 18{ hours a week of prime-time programming without
being subject to restrictions that bar CBS, NBC and ABC from the
lucrative syndication business.

   Prosecutors indefinitely postponed
Tuesday's scheduled arraignment of two radical environmentalists
accused of carrying a pipe bomb that exploded in their car and
injured them.
   ``We've decided to review all the evidence, including laboratory
test results, before making any further decision,'' said Chris
Carpenter, an assistant district attorney for Alameda County.
   Reviewing the local and FBI lab tests could take several weeks,
he said.
   Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney of the group Earth First! had been
scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday on charges of criminal possession
of explosives.
   Cherney's attorney, Doug Horngrad, said the prosecutors' action
indicates the charges were groundless.
   ``If they had a case to go forward on, they would have filed
charges today,'' Horngrad said. ``I'm of the opinion there aren't
going to be any charges.''
   The two activists were arrested Friday after a pipe bomb
exploded in their car in Oakland.
   Bari, 40, remains in stable condition at Highland Hospital with
a fractured pelvis and internal injuries; Cherney, 33, suffered a
cut over his left eye and a scratched cornea.
   In addition to the possession charges, Cherney was booked for
possession of a destructive device in a public place and for
possession of a booby trap. Bari was booked on all but the booby
trap charge.
   Bail was set for each at $100,000. Cherney was released late
Monday on Bari remains under protective custody in the hospital.
   Police are looking for a link between the Oakland car blast and
a May 10 pipe bomb that exploded at the Louisiana-Pacific Lumber
Co. in Cloverdale, about 80 miles north of San Francisco.
   But Earth First! supporters say Cherney and Bari are committed
to non-violence and were victims, not criminals.
   The two were driving to Santa Cruz for a rally to drum up
support for Redwood Summer, an Earth First!-sponsored campaign of
blockades and other protests to slow logging of ancient redwood
trees in Northern California. The campaign is modeled after the
civil rights movement's Mississippi Summer.
   Earth First!, widely considered a radical, extremist
environmentalist group, was founded in 1979 with the slogan ``No
compromise in defense of Mother Earth.'' The group has gained
notoriety for driving spikes in trees to damage logging equipment
and using other ``monkey-wrenching'' techniques.

   Nguyen Van Nam sat at his ``home'' at the High
Island Detention Center, the middle tier of a three-level bunk bed
he shares with his wife and two children, and vowed to die rather
than return to Vietnam.
   If Hong Kong refuses to grant him refugee status, he said
through an interpreter, ``We would rather be dead here than go back
to Vietnam.''
   Similar responses were echoed by several other High Island
residents during interviews Tuesday, indicating that the days of
tranquility for what has been a model detention center for
Vietnamese boat people may be numbered.
   So far, High Island has been free of the rioting, mass escapes
and occasional suicide attempts that have plagued other detention
centers for boat people since a group of 51 Vietnamese were
forceably repatriated late last year.
   The government has refused to allow journalists into any
detention center since the deportation, citing safety concerns.
   But in recent days, small groups of journalists have been taken
to High Island in an apparent attempt by the government to put the
best face on the camps, where squalid living conditions have been
the subject of harsh international criticism.
   ``We have at the moment a happy camp,'' Police Supt. R.L.
Nicholls said of the facility, which is in a country park about an
hour's drive from downtown Hong Kong. But, he added, ``We don't
think the complexion of this camp will last much longer.''
   A main reason that High Island has remained relatively calm is
that almost none of its residents have gone through the screening
process that determines who will be resettled overseas and who will
be repatriated. The camp is home to almost 7,000 people.
   By contrast, nearly 8,000 of the 22,000 Vietnamese at the
Whitehead Detention Center have been informed they will not be
granted refugee status. Security forces have fired tear gas to
quell rioting and uncovered hundreds of homemade weapons at the
camp in recent months.
   The screening of High Island residents is scheduled to begin
this summer. Police at the facility expect some resistance and
there are already signs of impending defiance.
   ``I'll never go back to Vietnam,'' said a 33-year-old man
surnamed Tran, who vowed to commit suicide if the government tries
to force him back.
   ``They can force me to go back to Vietnam only if they tie my
feet and hands,'' said Nguyen Son Ha, 49, from the northern
Vietnamese province of Quang Ninh.
   Several Vietnamese expressed concern about the screening
process, in which immigration officials determine who qualifies for
refugee status. To qualify for such status immigrants must prove
they fled their homeland out of a well-founded fear of persecution.
   All High Island residents interviewed by this reporter expressed
confidence they would be screened in, but more than 80 percent of
the boat people screened so far have been rejected.
   Vietnamese residents confirmed that High Island, which opened in
November, is a relatively quiet camp with little crime. But they
complain about the quality of food, the lack of books and magazines
and what they consider harsh treatment by some police officers.
   The boat people are crammed into 22 huts, each family sharing a
tiny bunk-bed tier, and the camp is surrounded by an approximately
20-foot-high fence topped with two loops of barbed wire.
   Many Vietnamese lie listlessly on their beds as children scamper
up and down the center aisle.
   But Nicholls points out there is more space between the huts at
High Island than at other detention centers, and there is a
basketball court and open concrete space for other games.
   He said about 900 children attend classes managed by
international volunteer agencies, and a $77,000 jungle gym donated
by a U.S. Buddhist organization is popular.
   Luu Chi Tich, a 49-year-old sports instructor from Hanoi summed
up the feeling in the camp. ``In general, we are sad here.''
   About 55,000 refugees who fled communist Vietnam to this British
colony live in camps. Nearly 11,000 are considered refugees,
another 10,600 are considered illegal immigrants and the remainder
await screening.

   Eight Hong Kong residents
convicted of trafficking in heroin were hanged today despite
appeals from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the human
rights group Amnesty International.
   Prison officials it was the highest number of hangings on a
single day and the first time a foreign woman has been executed in
Malaysia.
   Despite widespread criticism, Malaysian officials say they will
maintain the mandatory death penalty for anyone convicted of drug
trafficking.
   Officials say there are about 350,000 drug addicts among
Malaysia's 17.8 million people and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
has called illicit drugs Malaysia's ``No. 1 enemy.''
   Since 1975, 250 people have been sentenced to death for drug
trafficking. Of those, 92 have been hanged, including the eight
today.
   Those hanged include 26 foreigners: six Singaporeans, three
Thais, three Filipinos, three Indonesians, two Australians, a
Briton and the eight from Hong Kong.
   Under Malaysian law, a drug trafficking conviction does not
require proof of sale. The possession of more than one-half ounce
of heroin or 3{ ounces of marijuana is considered trafficking.
   Han Tsui Ling, 32, a waitress, and Chow Sing, 42, a used car
dealer, were hanged today at Kajang prison, 18 miles south of Kuala
Lumpur.
   Au King Chor, 32, Chan Yiu Tim, 32, and Yuen Kwok Kwan, 28, all
transport workers; Li Chi Peng, 28, a waiter; Ip Tak Meng, 36, a
supervisor in a vegetable marketing company in Kowloon; and Ng Yin
Kwok, 37, director of an insurance company in Kowloon, were
executed in Taiping Prison, 150 miles north of the capital.
   Police said the eight were on their way to Brussels with more
than 28 pounds of heroin in five suitcases when they were arrested
at Penang International Airport, 180 miles northwest of Kuala
Lumpur in October 1982.
   They were convicted in May 1985 and the Supreme Court turned
down their appeals four years later.
   A ninth Hong Kong resident arrested in the case, Tam Tak Wai,
has been sentenced to life.

<TEXT>
   Douglas Beattie's final bed on a cold, rainy
night was a steel trash bin. Death came in the morning, when the
container was emptied into a garbage truck and the 36-year-old
drifter was crushed.
   Authorities were disturbed by the manner of Beattie's death, but
it wasn't the first time a homeless stranger had passed away.
   A thousand miles away, Paula Wyatt had been waiting for word of
her brother for nine years, since he abruptly left home. He died
without her learning what led him to flee or how he had spent the
intervening years.
   ``This isn't a person who wasn't loved. He was loved dearly by a
lot of people,'' a sobbing Mrs. Wyatt said in a telephone interview
from her home in Whitehall, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb.
   ``His life has been a mystery for the family. He was a kind and
gentle person. He just couldn't hack it. ... We tried so hard to
find him and we couldn't.''
   Beattie was something of a loner and had a drinking problem.
Before he disappeared for good, his two brothers and two sisters
sometimes lost track of him during drinking binges, they said.
   The circumstances of his death have been so devastating that
some family members have been told only that he died of exposure,
said Mrs. Wyatt.
   ``We are all carrying a lot of guilt, a super amount of guilt,''
she said. ``If we had been able to reach Doug, it may have made a
difference.''
   Two years ago, the family tried to track him down to inform him
he had inherited about $15,000 from his aunt, said Ron Wyatt,
Beattie's brother-in-law.
   Ed Tutewiler of the Salvation Army in Wausau said he has seen
hundreds of men like Beattie, guys ``running away from themselves
by hitting the road.''
   What's different is the way Beattie died.
   ``Someone crushed by a garbage truck is unusual. Someone's
throat slit isn't,'' Tutewiler said. ``The streets are far more
dangerous to someone doing harm to you (than) a freak accident like
this.''
   An autopsy found that Beattie was alive when the garbage truck
lifted the trash bin and unloaded it May 10. The autopsy couldn't
determine whether he was conscious.
   A bulldozer operator at a landfill spotted the mangled body
among some rubbish. Authorities identified Beattie from a card he
carried from a post office.
   All Mrs. Wyatt knows about Beattie's life since he left in 1981
is what the police told her _ that he had been in Reno, Nev.,
within the past two years, was arrested for trespassing in Oregon
in June and arrived in Wausau about May 3.
   Beattie's family remembers him as kind to children. He had
worked as a bartender and had a talent for drawing; they had hoped
he would become an architect.
   Seeking to explain his problems, the family said Beattie's
father died when he was a baby. When he was a teen-ager, Beattie's
mother barely escaped a fire that destroyed their apartment, said
Ron Wyatt.
   Beattie's stay in Wausau was like that of other drifters,
authorities said. Police officer Craig Dunbar found him wandering
the streets drunk on May 3 with $2 to $3 in his pockets. Dunbar
took him to a mental health center, the local equivalent of the
drunk tank in the town of 33,000.
   ``He appeared very healthy, just drunk,'' Dunbar said. ``He
didn't seem like a bad guy, a troublemaker.''
   After his release from the center, Beattie spent two nights in a
motel courtesy of the Salvation Army, Tutewiler said. On May 9, a
Roman Catholic priest offered to pay for his stay at a motel.
   Later that evening, Beattie called the Rev. Jerome Hoeser from a
restaurant, telling him the motel claimed not to have a room. The
priest told Beattie to call him again from the motel. Hoeser never
received another call.
   The motel had vacancies, Hoeser said, but apparently mistrusted
Beattie because he didn't have ID.
   ``There was no reason why he shouldn't have been able to find a
place,'' the priest said.

<HEAD>EPA Memo Warns of Threat of Explosion at Nuclear Waste Dump</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gases could build up and explode at an
underground radioactive waste dump the government hopes to open
this year, according to a memo by an Environmental Protection
Agency official.
   The memo was released Tuesday at a hearing on the proposed Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant, which the Department of Energy hopes to use
as a permanent repository for wastes from nuclear weapons plants.
   The government hopes in the fall to begin a five-year test
program storing waste in the underground salt beds 26 miles
southeast of Carlsbad.
   The EPA held Tuesday's hearing to consider a variance that would
allow DOE to bypass certain hazardous waste treatment requirements.
To get the variance, the DOE must show the wastes would not leak
out.
   The memorandum, prepared in August by Ben Smith of the EPA's
Land Disposal Restriction branch, raises safety concerns that
should be addressed in an independent investigation, said James
Werner, a spokesman for the Natural Resources Defense Council,
which released the memo.
   Smith wrote that low-level waste would probably contain acetone
and various alcohols widely used as cleaning solvents.
   ``If these solvents are present ... the possibility of
accumulation of flammable gases in the waste storage rooms ... is
significant,'' he wrote. ``Such an explosion could kill hundreds of
workers and destroy the $700 million repository.''
   Smith said in an interview in today's New York Times that the
Energy Department had never seriously considered the threat of an
explosion. His superiors disregarded his conclusions, Smith said.
   An EPA spokesman said the agency had a consultant study the
issue after it received Smith's memo. Based on the consultant's
findings, ``We didn't think there was a serious gas buildup
explosion threat for the period we're talking about,'' said Matthew
Hale, an official in the EPA's Office of Solid Waste.
   The five-year program will allow EPA to determine how much gas
is generated in underground storage, Hale said. Gas buildups will
be monitored during the period.
   Michele Merola, a spokeswoman for Concerned Citizens for Nuclear
Safety, charged that the DOE's variance petition was ``being rushed
through the EPA at top speed.''
   An activist who identified himself as Richard Deyo was charged
with disorderly conduct after jumping onto the stage at the hearing
and upsetting the podium.

   ``Back to the Future Part III'' grossed $23.7
million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend for the No. 1 spot
at the nation's box office.
   The Universal Pictures time-travel sequel starring Michael J.
Fox earned $20 million less than ``Back to the Future Part II'' did
over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend last year.
   ``It won't be the biggest opening weekend this summer, but we're
very happy,'' said Tom Pollock, chairman of MCA's motion picture
group, makers of the ``Back to the Future'' trilogy. ``Movies are
not judged on opening weekends. They have to be judged on how long
they play and how much money they earn in relation to their cost.''
   ``Back to the Future Part III'' has received better reviews than
its immediate predecessor, which even Universal admits was not very
good.
   ``Back to the Future Part III'' did not open as well as the
Memorial Day films from the last three years. In 1989, ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade'' made $37 million; in 1988,
```Crocodile' Dundee II'' grossed $24.5 million, and in 1987
``Beverly Hills Cop'' took in $33 million.
   According to figures compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co., ``Back
to the Future Part III'' far outdistanced second-place ``Bird on a
Wire,'' with Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson. That film, also a
Universal release, grossed $12.8 million.
   In third was ``Pretty Woman'' with ticket sales of $8.2 million.
The comedy starring Julia Roberts as a streetwalker and Richard
Gere as a corporate raider now has made more than $120 million,
making it the year's biggest moneymaker.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Back to the Future Part III,'' Universal, $23.7 million,
2,019 screens, $11,740 per screen, $23.7 million, one week.
   2. ``Bird on a Wire,'' Universal, $12.8 million, 1,949 screens,
$6,565 per screen, $33.4 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $8.2 million, 1,803 screens, $4,542
per screen, $120.2 million, 10 weeks.
   4. ``Cadillac Man,'' Orion, $6.5 million, 1,844 screens, $3,509
per screen, $15.3 million, two weeks.
   5. ``Fire Birds,'' Disney, $6.4 million, 2,006 screens, $3,170
per screen, $6.4 million, one week.
   6. ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' New Line, $3 million, 1,970
screens, $1,516 per screen, $118.1 million, nine weeks.
   7. ``The Hunt for Red October,'' Paramount, $2.1 million, 1,061
screens, $2,006 per screen, $110.8 million, 13 weeks.
   8. ``Tales From the Darkside,'' Paramount, $1.6 million, 1,025
screens, $1,598 per screen, $14.5 million, four weeks.
   9. ``Joe Versus the Volcano,'' Warner Bros., $821,125, 746
screens, $1,101 per screen, $37.6 million, 12 weeks.
   10. ``Spaced Invaders,'' Disney, $734,724, 949 screens, $774 per

<TEXT>
   Shining Path rebels assassinated two leaders
of presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa's Democratic Front
coalition in separate attacks, police said.
   The shootings took place less than two weeks before Vargas
Llosa, a celebrated novelist and free-market advocate, faces
centrist Alberto Fujimori in a runoff presidential election.
   Fujimori, a political newcomer, is favored to win the June 10
showdown.
   Felix Vega Riquelme, the former governor of Piura, was shot to
death on Tuesday in the coastal city 530 miles northwest of Lima,
police said.
   Hours later, in the Andean city of Cerro de Pasco, Prospero
Delson Huaman was shot and killed, police said. Cerro de Pasco is
110 miles northeast of Lima.
   Vega was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle as he was
getting out of a pickup truck, police said. An unidentified
companion was seriously wounded.
   Delson was shot twice in the head by two rebels as he walked
home from his job at the Centromin mining company, police said.
   Before the formation of the Democratic Front coalition, both men
were leaders of the center-right Popular Action Party of former
president Fernando Belaunde.
   The Maoist-inspired Shining Path has tried to sabotage the
electoral process in Peru. Before April 8 general elections, the
rebels called an armed strike in Lima and most of Peru's
countryside.
   The government says more than 18,000 people have died in
political violence since the Shining Path took up arms 10 years ago.
   Also Tuesday, police said villagers armed with sticks, stones
and machetes battled over a disputed plot of land, leaving seven
people dead.
   As many as 50 people were injured in the clash, which took place
Monday night between the small Andean villages of Lircaycacca and
Chinabamba, police said. The villages are 30 miles southeast of
Huancavalica, an Andean city 145 miles southeast of Lima.
   The land battle followed three years of deteriorating relations
between the two isolated villages, police said.
   Earlier clashes between the villages, each of which has 200 to
300 residents, resulted in injuries but no deaths, police said.

<HEAD>States Cutting Food Program for Women and Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State governments, squeezed hard by rising
milk, orange juice and cereal prices, are making cuts in a
federally funded program that furnishes food to needy women,
infants and children.
   Thirty-six of 44 state governments responding to a recent survey
said they were cutting their portions of the $2.1 billion Special
Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, also
known as WIC.
   The survey was taken by the National Association of WIC
directors.
   Rep. Tony P. Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger, said a survey by his panel came up with
virtually the same results.
   ``It means we won't have as many healthy children and mothers as
we wanted because all of these people are medically at risk for
malnutrition and anemia,'' said Hall.
   The program provides poor women and their youngsters with
vouchers redeemable at the grocery store for specific kinds of food
in stated amounts. Included are milk, cheese, cereal, juice and
infant formula.
   It provided food to a record high 4.55 million individuals in
February.
   The program has been a favorite with Congress, which has
increased its funding every year despite demands for cutbacks in
the Reagan era. Hall is seeking a $150 million increase annually
for the next five years, with the first installment coming Oct. 1.
   The extra funds once were envisioned as a way of expanding the
program but supporters now are doubtful. ``If we stay even, we'll
be lucky,'' Hall said.
   Rising prices for milk, and to a lesser degree, orange juice and
cereal, have been pinpointed as the prime sources of the budgetary
strain.
   The Agriculture Department's food and nutrition service had
figured on inflation in food prices this year of a little over 4
percent. Authorities said the cost of basic items have risen at
about double the expected rate. Thus, grants to the states have not
been enough to maintain benefit levels.
   States have found varying ways to economize.
   ``We've talked to the states about the first measure being to
find less expensive ways to provide the same nutrition without
cutting volume of food or nutritional value of food,'' said F.
Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the food and nutritional
service.
   Texas has cut the cereal allowance for 1-year-olds and
2-year-olds from 36 ounces a month to 24 ounces a month and will
drop 27,000 program participants. Those receiving benefits reached
a peak of 357,000 in January.
   ``When prices go up on food items, that means our budget won't
go as far and we have to serve fewer people,'' said Ray Krzesniak,
chief of staff services for the Health Department's bureau of
women, infants and children.
   Texas gets $148 million from USDA under the program as well as
$5.5 million in state funds plus a hefty rebate on each can of
infant formula.
   Meanwhile, Iowa is planning to end benefits for post-partum
women who are not breast-feeding. That would drop an estimated
4,000 participants and reduce the total of individuals receiving
benefits to 45,000 for a $400,000 savings.
   California plans to cut the monthly juice allotment for children
3 years old to 5 years old for an expected savings of $1.2 million.
It also hopes to save $6 million by eliminating vouchers for cheese.
   Currently only about half of those eligible are receiving
benefits, according to Bach. Many states are not able to provide
food to individuals who fall into the lowest priority categories.
   ``There are literally millions of young children who would
qualify for WIC who are not getting served,'' Bach said.

   The Agriculture Department is proposing to
resume imports of ostriches and other flightless birds banned for
the last nine months after exotic ticks were found on some of the
creatures.
   The African Bont ticks and Bont-legged ticks were found on
ostriches imported from Tanzania on Aug. 2. The ban went into
effect on Aug. 15.
   The ticks carry heartwater and East Coast fever, diseases that
are not found in the United States and which do not affect humans
but which can become established among livestock and wildlife.
   The ostriches had been released from their 30-day quarantine at
a USDA-approved facility in Mundelein, Ill., without discovery of
the problem. The birds then were moved to farms in Texas, Oklahoma,
Ohio and Illinois. Officials said there was no sign that the ticks
had become established there.
   Other birds covered by the plan include cassowaries, emus, kiwis
and rheas.

<HEAD>Duke's Affirmative Action Ban Passes Louisiana House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill sponsored by former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke to ban affirmative action easily passed the
Lousiana House.
   The 66-28 vote Tuesday sent the measure to the Senate. The vote
crossed party lines; 13 representatives abstained.
   ``You can camouflage things but racism is racism,'' said one
opponent, Democratic Rep. C.D. Jones, who is black.
   He added, ``You still must understand that we live in the United
States and federal law takes precedence over the Louisiana
Legislature, and thank God for that.''
   Duke, a former KKK grand wizard elected to the House as a
Republican from a nearly all-white district in 1989, argued that
affirmative action seeks to ``eradicate discrimination by putting
in a policy of discrimination.''
   ``This bill simply prohibits racial discrimination in hiring,
promotion, scholarships,'' he said. ``There is no justification to
discriminate against someone who works hard, who is qualified for a
job.''
   The 39-year-old founder of the National Association for the
Advancement of White People is running for U.S. Senate. The state
GOP has endorsed another candidate.

   A strong earthquake centered just offshore
rattled northern Peru, killing at least 13 people and causing panic
among residents of coastal cities, according to the Geophysical
Institute and radio reports.
   The quake, measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, was centered in
the Pacific Ocean 110 miles southeast of Chiclayo, the Geophysical
Institute said. Chiclayo is 410 miles northwest of Lima.
   The Civil Defense Authority reported 13 deaths _ five each in
the neighboring towns of Rioja and Moyobamba and three in
Cajamarca. All three towns are southeast of Chiclayo and within 150
miles.
   A civil defense spokesman did not give details of how the
victims were killed. The spokesman, who did not give his name, said
houses were destroyed in the quake.
   The quake was felt as far north as the coastal town of Talara,
170 miles northwest of Chiclayo, and as far east Cajamarca, an
Andean city, the radio reports said.
   The Geophysical Institute said the quake shook Chiclayo with a
force of between 3 and 4 points on the Richter scale of ground
motion. A quake measuring 4 on the scale can cause moderate damage.

<TEXT>
   A bulldozer razed the McMartin Pre-School,
bringing to an end a frantic search by parents for secret tunnels
and hidden chambers where they claim their children were molested
and engaged in satanic rituals.
   Some of the parents held a news conference Tuesday to demand the
state bar association investigate District Attorney Ira Reiner's
prosecution of the case, the longest and costliest criminal trial
in U.S. history.
   Raymond Buckey, 31, is the remaining defendant in a case dating
to 1984 that once involved hundreds of child molestation
allegations at the school. The six other defendants were acquitted
or charges against them were dropped.
   Buckey is being retried on eight molestation counts unresolved
by a jury that acquitted his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey.
   In Manhattan Beach, construction crews Tuesday razed the
single-story school building to make way for an office building.
   Private investigator Ted Gunderson, a former FBI agent hired by
parents and others sympathetic to the alleged victims said he found
``disturbed dirt'' beneath the school. He said it indicated tunnels
and secret chambers once existed.
   The district attorney's office conducted a similar excavation
several years ago but found no evidence of tunnels.
   The parents' group, who previously have criticized Reiner for
allowing the trial to stretch indefinitely without success, Tuesday
attacked him for refusing to help their excavation.
   ``We shouldn't have to be paying for this,'' said JoAnne Farr,
whose 12-year-old daughter attended the McMartin Pre-School.
   Reiner has defended the prosecution and said he continued the
case out of the parents' desire for justice.
   Parent Marilyn Salas said courts in California should supply a
child's advocate to help children through testimony and to instruct
judges and juries on how children go through the process of
remembering events.
   She said recanting and then recalling details was normal for
children but considered unreliable by adults. Acquittals in the
McMartin case came after some of the children repeatedly changed
their stories.
   Salas said parents would like the state to change its statute of
limitations to allow children time to grow up. The current statute
gives people six years to bring charges in most crimes.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in Europe late this morning
and foreign currency dealers said trading was again dominated by
cross-movements.
   Gold prices fell.
   ``People really don't know what to do,'' said an analyst in
Milan, Italy. ``They go into the dollar even though they don't
really believe in it because they don't believe in the other
currencies either.''
   However, the West German mark was again firming, helped by
receding fears about the costs and consequences of monetary union
with East Germany, traders said.
   After a burst of speculation earlier this week, the market no
longer expects the Deutsche Bundesbank to tighten monetary policy
at its Central Bank Council meeting on Thursday, they said.
   Traders said the market was waiting for several important U.S.
economic indicators this week, including Friday's release of U.S.
employment data for May.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 150.75 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 150.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6725 West German marks, up from 1.6710
   _1.4070 Swiss francs, down from 1.4080
   _5.6380 French francs, up from 5.6280
   _1.8820 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8810
   _1,229.70 Italian lire, up from 1,228.25
   _$1.1795 Canadian, down from $1.1815
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7055, more
expensive for buyers than $1.6953 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $366.50 a troy ounce,
down from $367.60 late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $365.70 a troy ounce.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $365.85, down from $367.50 late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $2.01 to close at a bid $367.47.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.14 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.17.

   Rain fell in the Northeast, parts of the northern Plains and in
the inland mountains of the Pacific Northwest early today.
   A tornado watch was in effect for portions of central and
north-central Texas, with storms and flood-producing rain predicted
around the south-central Plains.
   Temperatures dropped close to or below freezing overnight in
parts of northern Michigan and Wisconsin and mountainous areas of
Pennsylvania.
   Rain was expected to move into the Atlantic later today, leaving
partially sunny skies in the Northeast.
   Scattered but heavy thunderstorms were expected in much of the
coastal Northwest, especially Oregon.
   Three tornadoes touched down in Texas, one in New Mexico and one
near Denver on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. They
caused no serious damage or injuries.
   Winds gusted to 90 mph at Hobart, Okla., damaging the roof of a
medical center.
   Heavy rainfall Tuesday included more than 2 inches in the
afternoon at Atlantic City, N.J.
   The nation's high for Tuesday was 104 degrees at Presidio, Texas.

   Charts and graphs are mighty boring,
weathermen can leave you snoring; but use some rap and fate be
willin', you'll know real soon if it's hot or chillin'.
   To add some spunk to weather reports, a syndicated forecaster
rapped to the music of Technotronic on Tuesday, and his word was
heard from Boston to Kansas City.
   ``Somebody put me up to it last week,'' said Elliot Abrams of
Accu-Weather Inc., which supplies local forecasts to radio stations
across the country. ``They said the only thing they haven't heard
me do was a rap version.''
   Listeners in Pennsylvania and Ohio heard the version Tuesday.
Stations in Boston, Cincinnati and Kansas City had rap reports
Monday.
   ``Elliot has a lot of poetic lines in his system and they're
trying to get out,'' said Mark Helms, executive editor at KYW-AM,
an all-news station in Philadelphia. ``It's not something we would
try every day.''
   The forecast for Pennsylvania was:
   ``Now dudes are wondering what comes here next, so I'll be
reading from this text; the word is going to bring no sorrow,
'cause rain that's here is gone tomorrow.
   ``It's raining. (Thump, thump, thump.) It's raining.
   ``Take this message to the street, tomorrow will not bring any
heat; the clouds will leave but it stays cool, so wear a coat,
don't be no fool.''
   The translation: Rain Tuesday, then clearing and cooler.
   ``He sounded good with it. I was stomping my foot,'' said John
Cigna, the morning host on KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh.
   The music was from Technotronic's ``Pump Up The Jam'' album.

<TEXT>
   Newspaper publishers from Japan to Sweden are
finding increased competition from TV for youthful attention and
classroom time.
   Participants at a daylong international conference Tuesday
focused on the role of newspapers inside and outside classrooms in
promoting literacy and creating future newspaper readers.
   The gathering, which drew 165 participants from 20 nations, was
a prelude to a three-day conference beginning today on the American
Newspaper Publishers Association's 25-year-old ``Newspapers in
Education'' program.
   The program is aimed at promoting use of newspapers in schools
around the world to help youngsters develop lifelong reading habits.
   Several publishers, including those from countries with the
highest literacy rates, said television is cutting into the reading
habits of young people.
   In Japan, for example, ``disenchantment with newspapers is
proceeding at a frightening pace,'' said Kazuo Ichiriki, chairman
and owner of the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, in Sendai.
   Japanese high school students spend an average of just six
minutes a day reading newspapers and 20 percent of university
students don't read newspapers daily, Ichiriki said.
   Japanese publishers began a Newspaper in Education program 4{
years ago, said Ichiriki, because people from that nation were
spending just 30 minutes a day reading and two hours a day watching
TV. About 85 percent of Japanese schools now make use of newspapers
in classroom lessons.
   The programs are important ``not just to protect our
self-interest but because the future of Japan could be adversely
affected,'' he said.
   ``We are in a war in fighting for resources and recognitiion in
schools,'' said Uzal H. Martz, Jr., president and publisher of the
Pottsville (Pa.) Republican.
   In Sweden, newspaper readership among 9-to-14-year-olds has
declined slightly recently after a decade of stability, largely due
to increased television viewing, said Birgitta Pahlen, Newspapers
in Education manager for the Swedish Newspaper Publishers
Association in Stockholm.

   The City Council passed a measure outlawing
ammunition sales during the weeks before the Fourth of July and New
Year's Eve holidays, when thousands of bullets are fired into the
air by revelers.
   Eight people were wounded last New Year's by slugs that
plummeted back to the Earth, hitting the ground at near-muzzle
velocity.
   A spokesman for a gun owners group said the problem should be
addressed through education, not legislation.
   Banning ammunition sales is ``like trying to solve the problem
of accidents at rush hour by prohibiting the sale of gasoline
between 3 and 6 p.m.,'' said B.J. Johnson.
   ``It's going to be an inconvenience for the persons who love to
stand in line just before New Year's Eve or the Fourth of July to
buy ammunition for the purpose of discharging their weapons,'' said
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who sponsored the measure.
   Mayor Tom Bradley is expected to sign it.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Urges Release of Congo Priest and Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today urged the Congo to
either try or release 26 political prisoners, including a Roman
Catholic priest and an ex-president held in the West African state
since 1987.
   The Rev. Joseph Ndinga's arrest reportedly stemmed from an order
that church bells be sounded to warn that government forces were
approaching to detain ex-President Joachim Yhomby-Opango, Amnesty
said.
   Some of the detainees have been accused of plotting to overthrow
the government of President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who belongs to
the Congo's Mbochi ethnic group. All the detainees are members of a
rival group, the Kouyou.
   The London-based international human rights organization said it
had received reports that some of the detainees have been severely
beaten in jail and it has grave doubts that they would get a fair
trial.
   The 26 prisoners, mostly civilians, were among some 70 members
of the Kouyou group arrested in 1987 or 1988 in the Congo capital,
Brazzaville, or in the northern town of Owando, where Ndinga has
his parish, Amnesty said.
   All the others were released without being charged before the
end of last year.
   ``Amnesty International believes that some of the remaining 26
are being held because of their nonviolent opposition to government
policies or their family or ethnic connections with those accused
of conspiring against the government,'' the organization said in a
report.
   Yhomby-Opango was jailed for five years without trial after he
was deposed in 1979. He was rearrested in 1987.
   Amnesty said it has adopted Ndinga as a ``prisoner of
conscience.'' The organization has adopted or is investigating
3,180 such prisoners worldwide _ people it believes have never
advocated violence and are held purely for their political or
religious beliefs.

<HEAD>Mandela Set to Begin 13-Country Tour Despite Hospitalization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, recuperating
from minor surgery, will probably remain hospitalized until the end
of the week but is scheduled to begin a 13-country tour on Monday,
officials said today.
   ``Mr. Mandela is up and about this morning and just fine,'' said
Dr. Gordon Cohen, director of the private Park Lane Clinic. ``I
don't expect him to go home before the weekend.''
   The 71-year-old African National Congress leader was admitted to
the clinic Sunday night for a complete physical examination that
had been planned for some time, ANC officials said. During the
examination, a minor operation was performed Monday, Cohen said.
   Neither the doctor nor Mandela's family would disclose the
nature of the operation, but Cohen said it was not serious and had
no long-term implications. He said Mandela was resting,
recuperating and receiving selected visitors.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said after visiting her husband Tuesday
night, ``If it wasn't for the crowds at his home, he would have
been home already. But his doctors felt he should rest.''
   According to a draft program released today by the ANC, Mandela
will visit 13 countries in Europe, North America and Africa from
June 4 to July 18.
   He will visit many of the European countries where South African
President F.W. de Klerk met government leaders earlier this month.
   Mandela's U.S. schedule calls for a ticker-tape parade in New
York City on June 20, an address to a joint session of Congress and
the United Nations General Assembly, and visits to Atlanta, Miami,
Detroit, Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif.
   Mandela has said he intends to counter de Klerk's message that
reform of apartheid is underway in South Africa.
   Mandela is also to visit Botswana, France, Switzerland, West
Germany, Itay, the Vatican, Canada, the United States, Ireland, the
United Kingdom, Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique.
   He is expected to meet government leaders in each country he
visits.
   Mandela's trip to the United States was to have overlapped a
visit there by de Klerk. But de Klerk postponed his visit on
Tuesday because of controversy over his scheduled meeting with
President Bush before Mandela.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops attacked a U.N.
compound early today where members of rival tribes had taken
shelter, killing a U.N. security guard and abducting at least 30
men, witnesses said.
   The incident came as frightened Liberian families packed their
belongings and fled the capital amid rumors that rebels are closing
in. Top ministers are apparently deserting President Samuel Doe to
join the exodus.
   ``We don't want to be slaughtered,'' said a Liberian outside the
embassy of neighboring Sierra Leone, where dozens sought visas
Tuesday. Many shops and schools were closed.
   In recent days, fighting between government troops and the
rebels moved to within 35 miles of Monrovia.
   Several hundred men, women and children of the Gio and Mano
tribes had sought refuge at the U.N. compound amd were sleeping in
the open there when about eight soldiers attacked at about 3:45
a.m., witnesses said on condition of anonymity.
   Jerry Samu, a U.N. security guard being treated for a bayonet
wound in the back, told reporters the soldiers said they were
looking for rebels, who get their support from the Gio and Mano
tribes.
   When guards refused to open the gates of the compound, about 5
miles from the city center, soldiers jumped the 5-foot wall,
rounded tribespeople up at gunpoint and made them strip, then
loaded them naked into several military jeeps, the witnesses said.
   Reporters who visited the compound were show a bundle of
clothing, shoes and sandals. Witnesses said it belonged to the
abductees.
   A woman who escaped said the soldiers were from Doe's Krahn
tribe.
   ``I heard them speaking Krahn,'' said the woman, who would not
give her name. ``One soldier wanted to kill us women. Another said
to let the women and children go. Then they let us go and took the
men away.''
   They said the vehicles headed down the road away from Monrovia
in the direction of Scheiffelin army barracks.
   Joseph Leeway, chairman of a committee of refugees, gave U.N.
officials a list of 27 missing people. ``These are just the names
that we could get,'' he said. ``We think there were many more. It
is a Krahn plot to eliminate Gios and Manos.''
   The attack came a few days after U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar sent a special envoy to Liberia to discuss the war
with Doe's government.
   On Sunday, Gios and Manos sought asylum at the U.S. Embassy, but
were turned away and sent to the United Nations. Those seeking
shelter say they want protection and safe conduct out of the
country.
   Meanhwile, the Liberian Senate was meeting this morning to
discuss a request from Doe for early elections in hopes of
resolving the 5-month-old conflict.
   On Tuesday, Doe's beleaguered government broadcast appeals for
the public to ``go about your normal business'' and refrain from
panic. But government officials themselves appeared far from calm.
   Diplomats said Doe, who took power in a bloody 1980 coup, has
been moving from one location to another during the night. His
presidential jet and an army Cessna were kept ready at an airfield
in the capital.
   Some government ministers have apparently already deserted Doe.
According to news reports and Western officials who met government
leaders, the portfolios for foreign affairs, internal affairs and
information were being handled by acting ministers.
   Although no authoritative word was available on the latest
fighting, reports broadcast Tuesday quoted rebel leader Charles
Taylor as claiming his troops had been attacking soldiers around
the country's main airport, an hour's drive from Monrovia.
   However, businessmen in the area said the airport remained open,
and British Airways said its flights were still arriving.
   Doctors in the capital set up a committee and mapped out
emergency plans to deal with casualties in case the city is
attacked.
   The military appeared less prepared. Scheiffelin Barracks, which
would be the last line of defense between the rebels' front line
and Monrovia, appeared deserted but for a half dozen soldiers at a
roadblock.
   Supermarkets in the capital did brisk business, although
shortages were worsening and prices climbing. Photographic studios
also did well as people lined up for passport photographs needed to
apply for visas.
   At many other businesses, people did not bother to show up for
work.
   ``What for? Everyone's waiting for the rebels,'' said one man.
   Many Monrovians said they not only fear the rebels but are also
frightened by undisciplined government soldiers, who they say are
often drunk or drugged.
   The national radio carried communiques Tuesday ordering soldiers
not to harass civilians.
   But refugees said soldiers unable to halt the rebel advance
sometimes had turned their wrath on civilians, raping, killing,
looting and burning down homes as they retreated toward the capital.

   Mayor Marion Barry acknowledges in a published
interview that he smoked crack cocaine the night of his arrest, but
he contends federal authorities tried to kill him by providing a
potent dose.
   In an interview in today's editions of The Washington Post, the
mayor also said he was confident he would not be convicted on drug
and perjury charges because ``in this town all it takes is one
juror saying, `I'm not going to convict Marion Barry.'''
   Barry said the FBI sting operation in January that led to his
arrest was part of a long effort by federal authorities to
discredit him.
   ``The prosecutors have been dipping and dabbling in the politics
of Washington for a long time, and it's unconscionable,'' the mayor
was quoted as saying. ``And then to try to kill me, it's
unprecedented.''
   Barry said the videotape that recorded the sting and his arrest
``is more damaging to the government than to me.''
   ``It shows they bought the liquor, they did everything there.
They had me ingest cocaine, crack cocaine, which could have killed
me ... I could have been dead now, with 70, 80, 90 percent pure
cocaine,'' the mayor said.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney, was not at home
to comment on Barry's remarks, her husband said late Tuesday night.
   On Tuesday, a federal judge set the stage for Barry's trial to
begin next week when he tentatively refused to separate 14 criminal
charges into two cases.
   Meanwhile, close advisers were telling Barry that he should
abandon his re-election hopes and seek a deal with prosecutors,
said top city officials who spoke on the condition they not be
identified.
   But Barry's campaign staff director, Anita Bonds, denied a
report that the mayor would consider making a deal with the
government.
   Barry ``is getting himself ready for trial. Plea bargaining is
not in the picture,'' Bonds said.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said that by
Thursday prosecutors must provide the defense with names of
government witnesses and any previous statements those witnesses
have made to investigators.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts said prosecutors expect
to have about 30 witnesses testify against Barry.
   Jury selection is scheduled to start Monday.
   The mayor is charged with three felony counts of perjury before
a federal grand jury in connection with his alleged involvement
with drugs. He also is accused of 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy.
   Barry's lawyers had asked to sever the conspiracy charge and
five drug possession charges brought May 10. Defense attorneys
argued that the government hadn't named Barry's alleged
co-conspirators and hadn't given times and places for the new
charges.
   Jackson said that splitting the charges into two trials would
create problems.
   ``I don't know how we would pick a second jury'' that hadn't
been exposed to testimony from the first trial, the judge said.
   Barry's lawyers said they would not try to use alcoholism as a
defense.
   The defense could have called witnesses to suggest that Barry's
drinking diminished his capacity to give complete and accurate
answers to investigators.
   Using such a defense would have required Barry to turn over his
medical records to the government.
   Barry was treated for substance abuse at clinics in Florida and
South Carolina after his Jan. 18 arrest.
   As for Barry's political plans, the sources said that longtime
Barry associates Ivanhoe Donaldson, Joseph Yeldell and Elijah
Rogers all have urged the mayor not to seek re-election in recent
days. The same men also have advised the mayor to enter plea
negotiations, the sources said.
   When Barry left a weekend meeting with those former aides, the
mayor ``was leaning against'' running for a fourth, four-year term,
said sources familiar with the discussion. But sources also said
that Barry was far less responsive to suggestions that he negotiate
with prosecutors.
   Barry campaign officials picked up petitions Friday for a
potential re-election bid, the first formal step to a possible
candidacy.

<HEAD>House Members' Outside Income: Speaking Fees, Free Trips, Wedding
Gifts</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 6th graf, And winter ... to INSERT Madigan's home state</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Howard Coble won $600 in a pinball
tournament. Rep. Silvio Conte sold $250 worth of hay. And Rep.
Olympia Snowe got $9,914 in wedding gifts.
   Those nuggets are among the information, from the momentous to
the trivial, spread on the public record Tuesday when the House
released its annual financial disclosure forms.
   The forms illustrated how for most House members, the $89,500
salary the taxpayers paid them in 1989 was only part of their total
income. And they showed how widespread is the practice not only of
accepting speaking fees from special interests, but also of
accepting expense-paid trips to make the speeches.
   For example, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who is on the panel
that doles out money for defense, made separate trips to California
in February and December, collecting $6,000 each time from defense
contractors. Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., reported 24 free trips
during the year to speak to interest groups.
   Often the travel appears to be less than all work. The American
Horse Council paid for two days in Lexington, Ky., for Rep. Toby
Roth, R-Wis., and his wife, including tickets to the Kentucky Derby.
   And winter speaking trips often are to destinations warmer than
Washington. Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois and his wife made such
forays to Rancho Mirage, Calif.; Orlando, Fla.; and Phoenix, Ariz.
Two of the trips were to speak to groups affected by the House
Agriculture Committee, on which Madigan is the senior GOP member.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., got five days with his wife in Jamaica
for a conference sponsored by the Aspen Institute, which also paid
for a separate trip for Gray to Bermuda.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways
and Means Committee, was the overall speaking fee champion,
collecting $285,000 during the year. Members are allowed to keep
only $26,850, so Rostenkowski gave the rest to charity.
   Others receiving top dollar for speaking were Gray, the No. 3
House leadership figure, who took in $164,098, and Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., who claimed $160,517. Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., reported he received $32,000 in honoraria, and Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., reported $34,500. Republican Whip
Newt Gingrich of Georgia collected $67,491, and handed over $29,304
to the Atlanta Zoo.
   As part of a bill raising their government salaries, House
members agreed that 1990 will be the last year they will receive
honoraria. Senators will allow themselves lower government salaries
than House members after this year but will keep their speaking
fees.
   Among the bits of financial trivia reported Tuesday:
   _Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, was married during the year to
Maine Gov. John McKernan, and listed her wedding gifts, including a
bicentennial bowl worth $310 from Sen. George Mitchell, a Democrat.
According to the list, she could still use three place settings in
her china pattern. She's got enough candlesticks.
   _Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., put his total worth at $2.2
million. Along with stock dividends and rental income, he listed
$250 from the sale of hay.
   _Rep. Howard Coble, a North Carolina Republican, said he won
$600 in a congressional pinball tournament sponsored by the
Amusement and Music Operators Association. He said he gave it to
charity.
   _Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C., wasn't required to, but he kept
track of the little goodies that flowed into his office from
lobbyists and others in 1989. His list included books and T-shirts,
pork rinds, bug spray, a golf umbrella and three pairs of socks.
There was an IBM paperweight, a miniature television, candy, wine
and two tickets to Washington Redskins football games. Total:
$2,145.38.
   _Republican Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin is a
philatelist who values his stamp collection at $25,000. Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas, collects coins and says his collection is worth
more than $16,000.
   _Reps. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., and Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., each
received small Oriental rugs from Benazir Bhutto, the prime
minister of Pakistan, who made a speech to a joint meeting of
Congress last year.
   _Freshman Republican Rep. Porter M. Goss of Florida turns out to
also be among the wealthiest members of Congress. His assets are
valued at $5.4 million to $10.9 million or more, including stocks,
bonds and real estate.
   In addition to their speaking fees and other honoraria, members
of Congress and most other federal officials are required to
disclose their assets, not including their homes; their
investments, most liabilities and gifts.
   But the numbers usually are not precise because the forms
require that values be listed only by broad category. For example,
a multimillion-dollar holding is reported only as worth more than
$250,000.

   Emergency workers burned off gases
still leaking today from a runaway oil and gas well that exploded,
killing two workers and injuring four others.
   Most of about 200 people evacuated after the Tuesday afternoon
series of explosions returned home Tuesday night. Those within a
one-mile radius were told to wait until the well is capped, Jasper
County civil defense director Joe Stringer said this morning. He
said 60 to 65 people were kept away from their homes today.
   Crews cleared away debris from the collapsed rig in hopes the
capping could be completed by afternoon.
   Officials used flares and flame throwers Tuesday to set fire to
the escaping gas, said Jim Maher, director of the Mississippi
Emergency Management Agency in Jackson.
   The fire was a precaution against poisonous hydrogen sulfide
gas, which occurs naturally in some fields. A spokesman for Wild
Well Control Inc. of Spring, Texas, said Tuesday night that no
traces of hydrogen sulfide were detected.
   The well is owned by R &amp; H Oil &amp; Gas Inc., of Tickfaw, La.
Officials there said the well was 20 years old and they were in the
process of drilling to deeper levels for oil and gas.
   Alex Thomas, who lives within a half-mile of the rig, said he
heard four successive explosions about 2 p.m. Others said there was
another blast later in the afternoon.
   Roads were closed leading to the well, which is about 75 miles
southeast of Jackson, as was a five-mile stretch of U.S. Highway 11.
   Salt water, sand and mud were seeping out of the well along with
the gases, said Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman
Dusty Perkins. Before a pilot light was set to keep the gases
burning, the silt occasionally extinguished the flame and allowed
gases to escape into the air.
   Dwayne Kennedy, 24, died at the scene and Dudley Barnett, whose
age was unavailable, died later Tuesday at the South Alabama Burn
Center in Mobile, authorities said.
   Well workers Donnie Bolivar, 31 and Michael McCormick, 32, were
listed in critical condition at the burn center. Charles Windham,
40, was listed in serious but stable condition at the Mississippi
Firefighters Memorial Burn Center in Greenville. Another man was
treated for minor injuries.

   Jacqueline Valente, freed in Beirut in April after
more than two years as a hostage, was sentenced to two months in
prison today for taking two daughters from her ex-husband in
defiance of a custody ruling.
   Prosecutors had requested only a one-month suspended sentence
during the hearing in Toulon, but the presiding judge, Andre
Fortin, decided to impose a harsher penalty.
   He said Ms. Valente, 32, had committed a ``premeditated
kidnapping'' in 1983 and expressed irritation that she refused to
answer questions about the mysterious circumstances of her own
abduction.
   Ms. Valente was allowed to remain free pending an appeal and
possible medical tests. She was sentenced to six months in prison,
four of which were suspended.
   The case dates back to August 1983, when Ms. Valente refused to
take her daughters _ Marie-Laure and Virginie _ back to their
father after one of their regular visits with her.
   No word was heard about Ms. Valente and the girls until November
1987, when a Fatah-Revolutionary Council _ a Libyan-backed
Palestinian group led by terrorist Abu Nidal _ declared it had
taken them hostage, along with five Belgians also aboard a yacht in
Mediterranean.
   The two girls were freed in 1988, and Ms. Valente was freed
April 10, along with her Belgian companion, Fernand Houtekins, and
their own daughter, Sophie-Liberte.
   Prior to the release, Sophie-Liberte had been widely described
as a 2-year-old born in captivity. But relatives and others, after
meeting her in person, agreed she was at least 4, leading to press
speculation that the yacht was seized much earlier than previously
reported.
   Newspapers also said that the hostages had been kept in Libya,
despite their claims they were held in Lebanon, and had been
abducted by the Libyan navy, not by Abu Nidal's group.
   Ms. Valente and Houtekins refused to discuss these matters in
public, saying they did not want to jeopardize efforts to free
Houtekins' four relatives still held.
   During the court proceedings, Ms. Valente's lack of substantive
answers prompted the judge to accuse of her of ``bad faith.'' She
frequently testified she did not remember details about her
abduction.
   Fortin said Ms. Valente took the two girls out of France
clandestinely, using false passports.
   ``And the children _ in all of this did you think of them?'' he
asked.
   Ms. Valente's ex-husband, Pascal Betille, declined to comment on
the judgment, saying he wanted to minimize any adverse effects on
the two girls.
   He expressed hope that authorities would grant his request to
cancel Ms. Valente's visiting rights.

   NASA said it will be late tonight
before engineers can pinpoint two hydrogen leaks that forced
cancellation of today's launch of Columbia and its $150 million
observatory.
   The planned 12:38 a.m. liftoff was scrubbed just six hours
before launch after sensors detected rising levels of hydrogen gas
in Columbia's engine compartment. The gas leak occurred while the
shuttle's rocket propellant tank was being loaded with liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen.
   NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said today that all of the
propellant must be vented from Columbia's big external tank before
workers can search for the exact point of the leaks in the maze of
plumbing in the spacecraft's aft engine compartment.
   Buckingham said that it will be late tonight or early Thursday
before NASA engineers know for certain what repairs are needed.
   Earlier, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said it will be ``at least
several days'' before another launch attempt.
   Columbia's seven astronauts were in their quarters several miles
from the launch pad Tuesday when the hydrogen leaks were
discovered. They were to have boarded the space shuttle about two
hours before launch.
   Four of the astronauts left the Kennedy Space Center this
morning to fly to their home base at the Johnson Space Center near
Houston. The other three crewmen were to follow later today.
   Although concentrated hydrogen is highly explosive, Malone said
Columbia ``was never in an unsafe position at any time.''
   NASA engineers spent hours opening and closing valves and
watching a network of sensors before finding the general area of
the leaks about midnight. One was from a 17-inch valve in a pipe
that carries fuel from the tank to the engines; the other was in
ground equipment, Malone said.
   Shuttles have three main engines that burn a propellant of
oxygen and hydrogen. The propellant, chilled to a liquid, is loaded
into the external tank about five hours before launch. The tank
actually contains two vessels, one for the oxygen and one for the
hydrogen. The two elements are combined in the rocket engines,
where they ignite and produce thrust.
   About 5 percent of the liquid hydrogen _ or nearly 20,000
gallons _ had been pumped into the external tank when the scrub was
announced, officials said. Less than 25 percent of the liquid
oxygen _ or 35,800 gallons _ had been loaded.
   Columbia is to be the first shuttle flight in five years devoted
entirely to scientific research.
   Its payload, an observatory called Astro, will study invisible
radiation streaming from distant stars and galaxies. The crew will
work an intense, around-the-clock schedule of observations during
the nine-day mission.
   The observatory includes three telescopes that detect
ultraviolet radiation given off by stars and planets, and a fourth
telescope that will detect X-rays.
   ``We humans look at the universe in visible light,'' said
Lennard Fisk, chief NASA scientist. ``But the universe is, in fact,
bright in many other kinds of radiation, and Astro will allow us to
see the universe in ultraviolet light and in X-rays.''
   The Astro instruments are in Columbia's cargo bay. They will be
operated remotely by astronauts on board the shuttle and by signals
from the ground.
   Columbia's crew includes four astronomers _ Jeffrey A. Hoffman,
Robert A. R. Parker, Samuel T. Durrance and Ronald Parise. The
commander is Vance D. Brand, the pilot Guy S. Gardner, the seventh
crewman John M. Lounge.
   The astronauts also will give science instruction to 42 middle
school students at two NASA centers. The teaching will be recorded
on videotape and distributed nationwide.
   Columbia also has on board a ham radio, and the astronauts hope
to talk to cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station Mir and to
operators of amateur radio stations around the world.

   To those who knew the frugal ways of longtime
newspaper reporter Virginia Wood Davis, she was the last person
they thought would leave behind a personal fortune worth $2.5
million.
   ``We thought Virginia was poor _ she had everyone fooled,''
friend and executor of the will Jim Taylor said this week. ``I have
cursed and fussed and just asked, `Why Virginia, why?'''
   Until shortly before she died of cancer on Feb. 1 at the age of
70, all she appeared to have was her two-bedroom house here, a few
household and personal belongings, and her Ford truck.
   But before her death, Ms. Davis put about $2.1 million into
certificates of deposit divided among her friends. In a will, she
bequeathed 80 percent of the remaining $400,000 to the journalism
department at her alma mater, Western Kentucky University.
   She also left a 194-page typewritten account of her life, her
own eulogy, and instructions for her cremation.
   Ms. Davis had been a reporter and editor since 1943. She worked
for 13 newspapers, including the Tampa Times, the Tampa Tribune,
The St. Petersburg Times, and the Pasco News in Dade City. Her last
job was with the McCreary Co. Record in Whitley City, Ky.
   At the end of her career, in the early 1980s, she earned $325 a
week.
   Friends and relatives say she saved money and denied herself
even the most basic comforts.
   Ms. Davis' clothing appeared to be second hand and most of the
vehicles she drove had seen better days.
   To beat grocery store prices, Ms. Davis would go to nearby
fields and pick unharvested leftovers.
   ``Virginia could not stand to see any of the vegetables go to
waste, but some of the stuff was not any good,'' said friend
Pauline McCall. ``She insisted on picking it.''
   Ms. McCall believes her friend saved fanatically because she was
afraid she would be faced with a major emergency and wouldn't be
able to handle it.
   ``We just all accepted Virginia for who she was,'' Taylor said,
``our friend.''

   Soviet patrol boats have arrested 170 Japanese
fishermen caught aboard North Korean vessels, and Moscow will
reportedly put the men on trial for ``malicious poaching'' in
Soviet waters.
   The incident in the North Pacific has proved potentially
embarrassing to the Japanese government and revealed further
strains in the alliance between North Korea and the Soviet Union.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said today the
Japanese Embassy in Moscow began inquiries into the seizure about
10 days ago.
   Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic relations, but the
unfolding saga has revealed a burgeoning relationship between the
two countries' fishermen.
   Among the 202 crew members on the vessels were 170 Japanese. The
officers and other crew members were North Koreans, Japanese
authorities said.
   The Japanese coast guard said a Soviet naval vessel escorted
eight of the seized fishing boats early today to port in the
Soviet-held island of Shikotan in the Kuril chain, 45 miles off the
northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted a Soviet official in Moscow
as saying the fishermen would be tried on Shikotan within five
days. Such incidents usually are settled by fines or confiscation
of fishing boats.
   Japan has an agreement to take 11,000 tons of Soviet salmon a
year, and regularly fills that quota. It was not immediately clear
what advantage the Japanese fishing company, Shoho Fisheries Co.,
gained from fishing under the North Korean flag.
   A fishery official, who demanded anonymity, said North Korea had
no agreement to capture Soviet salmon in the North Pacific fishing
waters.
   Soviet authorities have accused North Korea of ``malicious
poaching'' of salmon that spawned in Soviet rivers, Kyodo News
Service reported from Moscow.
   Agreement on a quota is required before a country's vessels can
take salmon that originated in another country's rivers, said
Tatsuaki Maeda, a Hokkaido University professor who specializes in
fishing territories.
   ``It is still illegal to go fishing in Soviet territory under
the North Korean flag, and in that sense, I don't understand the
merit of sending disguised (Japanese) ships over there,'' Maeda
said.
   He said, however, that it was possible the Japanese fishermen
might have thought there would be no problem since North Korea and
the Soviet Union are allies. Such a deal also could have given the
North Koreans much-desired foreign currency, he said.
   Maeda said several countries have fished salmon on the high seas
without quota agreements and have been overlooked for years, paying
no penalties and angering fishermen from countries bound by quota
agreements.
   The non-quota fishing countries include North and South Korea
and Taiwan, he said.
   The North Korean-flagged ships were seized outside the 200-mile
Soviet zone, the Foreign Ministry said. But under international
rules, migratory fish such as salmon belong to the country where
they were spawned.
   A spokesman for a Hokkaido fishing company, Kitajima Fisheries,
said his company's vessel was one of those hired out through
another Japanese company to provide ``technical guidance'' to the
North Koreans. ``We are not poaching fish,'' said the spokesman,
who refused to have his name used.
   The Soviet Embassy in Tokyo declined to comment today on the
case.

<HEAD>Brothers Can Visit, Say Couple Who Returned One Boy to Orphanage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two brothers separated when their adoptive
parents returned one of them to an orphanage will be allowed to
visit each other, the couple has decided after a legal battle.
   A tentative agreement reached Tuesday will allow the boys to
visit weekly, with flexibility for scheduling conflicts or for the
changing desires of the children.
   The older boy, identified only as 11-year-old Tony, was given up
by a suburban Bellwood couple after six years about six months ago,
when the couple said they could not form an emotional attachment to
the boy.
   When the boy later asked to see his 8-year-old biological
brother, who was still living with the couple, the couple declined,
saying they were afraid the older boy was emotionally unstable and
potentially violent.
   Tuesday's settlement appeared to end three months of court
battles seeking to allow visitation between the two boys. An April
court order allowed visits. But the couple went back to court to
stop the visits, making new claims about the older boy's violent
tendencies.
   Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy, representing the
older boy, countered with demands that the parents undergo
psychological testing and provide depositions documenting the older
boy's behavior.
   Murphy said Tuesday the latest demands were dropped and he was
satisfied with the agreement.
   ``It's what we originally asked for,'' he said.
   Murphy, who had filed a lawsuit seeking $50,000 in emotional
damages from the parents, also agreed to drop the lawsuit.
   ``The emotional harm was for refusal to grant visits,'' Murphy
said. ``This negates that.''
   The older boy, originally returned to the Hephzibah Children's
Association Orphanage, is now living with a foster family in
suburban Oak Park.

   Arab leaders today called for political and
economic sanctions against nations that recognize Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel, and they denounced U.S. policies in the Middle
East.
   They also promised to take action against countries that support
the emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel and Israel's continued
control of the occupied territories, a Palestine Liberation
Organization spokesman said.
   However, the Arab leaders' statement at the end of their summit
meeting did not contain the harsh condemnation of U.S. policy that
Iraq, the PLO and other Arab hard-liners had demanded. Egypt and
Saudi Arabia led the moderates.
   Winding up the three-day summit, the Arab leaders also pledged
to take united action to ensure the world's 5 million Palestinians
gain an independent state. They said Arab east Jerusalem should be
its capital.
   In their closing communique today, the representatives of 16
Arab nations said, ``The summit affirmed that the Arab powers will
take political and economic measures against whichever country
recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.'' It did describe
the measures or name nations to be targeted.
   ``The purpose for which the conference was convened has been
realized,'' Yasser Abed-Rabbo, a member of the PLO's ruling
execuive council, told reporters. He also said in an earlier
session with reporters that the Arab leaders called for sanctions
against countries that encourage the emigration of Soviet Jews to
Israel and the Israeli occupation of Arab land.
   The summit hard-liners had demanded tough action to block the
expected emigration of as many 750,000 Soviet Jews to Israel in the
next few years. The influx began after U.S. officials tightened
immigration quotas and Soviet authorities relaxed their rules for
travel to Israel.
   The moderates have been arguing against using the Arabs'
economic wealth as a political weapon, and they have been battling
to avoid provoking tension amid the climate of uncertainty in the
volatile Middle East.
   It was not clear whether the proposed sanctions would involve
disrupting Arab oil exports, as Iraq has proposed. But most
analysts believe it is unlikely that the Arab producers will impose
an oil embargo as they did in 1973 to protest Western support for
Israel in the October war of that year.
   Abed-Rabbo said the leaders agreed to form a committee of the
foreign and economic ministers of the 21-member Arab League to
draft within two months ``a detailed plan of action that links the
political and economic relations with other countries to their
policy toward the Arab cause.''
   Abed-Rabbo leads the PLO delegation that has been negotiating
with the United States in Tunis, Tunisia, since PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat publicly renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right
to exist in November 1988.
   Israeli immigration officials said Sunday they expect up to
20,000 Soviet Jews a month, with 150,000 arriving in the Jewish
state this year.
   The current influx of Soviet Jews to Israel is coming mainly
through Hungary, Poland, Finland and Austria.
   The Arabs fear that the unrestricted immigration of large
numbers of Soviet Jews to Israel will undermine peace efforts. They
are also concerned that many of the Soviet Jews will be settled in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, forcing out hundreds
of thousands of Palestinians.
   The occupied territories, seized by Israel in 1967, were
designated an independent Palestinian state by the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, the Palestine National Council, in 1988. The
Israelis also seized Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later annexed it.
   In the closing statement, the Arab leaders condemned the U.S.
House and Senate for supporting Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its
``eternal capital.''
   They made the statement even though the United States officially
recognizes Tel Aviv as Israel's capital. U.S. policy is that the
status of Jerusalem must be negotiated.
   However, the summit stopped short of a threatened denunciation
of the U.S. administration for supporting Israel and being biased
against the Arabs.
   The summit also paid tribute to the 30-month-old Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   The leaders stressed the ``necessity of extending official and
public assistance materially and politically until the ultimate
objective is achieved, and the Palestinian state is created'' in
the West Bank and Gaza.

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the newly elected president of
the Russian republic, sat down with 130 legislators today to
negotiate the makeup of a coalition government for the largest
Soviet republic.
   Legislators said Yeltsin immediately came under pressure to
retain as Russian prime minister Alexander Vlasov, a member of the
Communist Party Politburo who had been Yeltsin's rival in Tuesday's
balloting for president.
   Yeltsin opened today's meeting in a businesslike fashion and set
only one limit, asking that one of his deputies be a woman,
legislators said.
   Yeltsin, a frequent critic of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his gradual reforms, was reported to have gained the
last few votes he needed by offering to guarantee a place in his
government for other factions.
   Although most of the Russian legislators are Communist Party
members, they range from radical reformers like Yeltsin to
hard-liners unhappy with even the more modest innovations of
Gorbachev.
   Yeltsin won his new job Tuesday on the third ballot in the
Russian Congress of People's Deputies.
   Yeltsin poses a substantial challenge to Gorbachev, both through
his personal popularity and his demand that much authority be
transferred from Gorbachev's central government to the republics.
   That would greatly increase his power, since Russia is the
largest republic with 52 percent of the Soviet Union's 289 million
people and three-quarters of its land.
   The strapping, white-haired Siberian said Tuesday he would seek
reconciliation with Gorbachev and avoid confrontation with him as
long as it would not hurt Russia's interests.
   He took the first step in that direction today, meeting in the
ornate St. George's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace with
representatives of each political faction and each ethnic region in
the Russian Federation.
   Yeltsin asked for two to three nominations for each ministerial
post in the Russian government. He said the candidates would be
presented to the full Russian Congress for confirmation starting
Thursday. It was not clear how such a system would lead to the
delicate balance of political forces and personalities typical of a
coalition government in the West.
   The session was closed to reporters after the first few minutes.
   Legislators said the talks were not aimed at parceling out
portfolios in the Council of Ministers to specific political
parties or factions.
   ``We don't really have hard political divisions like that right
now,'' explained Igor Bratishev, an economist and deputy from
Rostov-on-Don who participated in today's meeting with 130
legislators arrayed around a vast rectangle under the ornate
vaulted ceiling of St. George's Hall.
   So far, 24 legislative groups have registered, including
Yeltsin's own Democratic Russia and one called Communists of
Russia. But the majority have a narrow focus, such as ecology,
medical workers and legislators concerned with the problems of
refugees.
   The so-called ``conciliation committee'' is seeking a consensus
on candidates for prime minister and the three assistants to
Yeltsin, said Vladimir Ivanov, a legislator from Buryatia near Lake
Baikal in Siberia.
   ``People want Yeltsin to suggest Vlasov for prime minister,''
Ivanov said.
   The committee, representing each political group and each ethnic
region in the Russian Federation, is examining candidates' personal
qualifications and morale convictions, Bratishev said.
   In Ottawa, Canada, on Tuesday Gorbachev told reporters he was
``somewhat concerned'' about Yeltsin's victory but encouraged by
the new Russian president's vow to settle divisions in the Congress
and work with the Kremlin leadership.
   ``If, however, he is playing a political game, then we may be in
for a difficult time,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev, who was to arrive in Washington today for a summit
with President Bush, spent days watching the struggle for control
of the Russian Congress. He even took the floor to speak against
Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin and many Soviets said the election could help advance
reforms in the Soviet Union.
   ``It may be a blessing in disguise,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Gerasimov told reporters at the United Nations in
New York. ``Gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the
right, and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic
from the left.''
   Vitaly Churkin, another Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Yeltsin's election ``might actually help Gorbachev because
Gorbachev is for radical reform, and he needs more popular support
for that.''
   Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow to head the city's Communist
Party, but the two men fell out over Yeltsin's public criticism in
1987 of the pace of reform and have been at odds ever since.
   As president of the Russian Congress, a newly created body that
holds the Russian Federation's highest government authority,
Yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic.
   As the first president of a newly reorganized legislature, he
will play a major role in shaping his powers and duties, which as
yet are unclear.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a
bid to expand Soviet contacts with industrialized countries, will
meet in San Francisco after the Washington summit with South Korean
President Roh Tae-woo, U.S. officials said today.
   The two countries have no formal diplomatic relations and the
Soviets maintain strong ties with North Korea, which conducted a
brief and now-suspended dialogue with the pro-U.S. government in
Seoul.
   Gorbachev is struggling to get a grip on the Soviet economy. As
he left Moscow for talks beginning on Thursday with President Bush,
the Soviet capital and other cities were experiencing panic buying
in anticipation of broad price hikes pegged to adoption of a market
system.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting with Roh would be held while Gorbachev was in San Francisco
as part of his sight-seeing expedition after the summit talks
concluded on Sunday.
   Gorbachev also is stopping in Minneapolis after his four days in
Washington.
   The meeting is the most dramatic gesture by the Soviets toward
South Korea, a foe for more than 40 years of Moscow-backed North
Korea.
   Moscow is emerging as a promising trading partner for South
Korea, and trade and other relations are expanding rapidly.
   In December 1989, the Soviet Union and South Korea opened
``consular departments'' in their trade offices in each other's
capitals and began limited consular service.
   The arrangement restricts the functions of the departments and
the qualifications of officials working there. The departments
cannot fly national flags, and officials working there are denied
normal diplomatic privileges.
   In March, South Korean news reports said the Soviet Union has
proposed opening full consular ties with South Korea as a prelude
to establishing formal diplomatic relations.
   The proposal from Soviet officials came as Kim Young-sam, leader
of South Korea's governing party, visited Moscow and said his
country's basic position is to move directly to formal diplomatic
ties without going through an intermediary step, the news reports
said.
   South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong signed an agreement
in Prague in March establishing formal diplomatic relations with
Czechoslovakia. Last year, Poland and Hungary set up ties with
South Korea.
   The Bush administration, which has been encouraging dialogue
between the two Koreas, welcomed the return Monday by North Korea
of the remains of five American servicemen killed in the Korean
conflict.
   It was the first return of American remains in 36 years by North
Korea. North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Ho Jong,
said in an interview published Sunday that his country wants
``practical measures'' to improve U.S.-North Korean relations.
   The new North Korean attitude appeared to be linked to Moscow's
previous efforts to expand contacts with South Korea. U.S.
officials have said North Korea may also be concerned that the
turmoil within the Soviet Union could threaten the large-scale
assistance Moscow provides to that country.

<HEAD>Eight Indicted on Charges of Enslaving 100 Mexicans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flower grower and seven other people are
charged with enslaving more than 100 undocumented workers from
Mexico and forcing them to work long hours at petty wages.
   Lured by promises of good pay, the Mexicans were smuggled into
the United States, then kept at the 50-acre ranch until they could
pay off a $435 smuggling fee, according to a federal grand jury
indictment issued Tuesday.
   The ranch operators beat workers and threatened to alert
immigration authorities if they tried to leave the compound, which
was surrounded by a 7-foot fence, the indictment alleged.
   Ranch owner Edwin M. Ives, 54, and five other people face up to
52 years in prison and $2 million in fines if convicted of all 15
charges in the indictment, federal prosecutors said.
   The charges involve labor and civil rights violations and a
federal anti-slavery statute, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Carol
Gillam.
   Two ranch foremen, Naju Lnu and Paringer Singh, were named in a
criminal complaint filed last month.
   ``This is a very significant case that involves very serious
violations of people's human rights,'' Gillam said. The charges
were developed based on allegations by former workers and ranch
documents, Gillam said.
   Ives' attorney, Robert M. Talcott, has maintained that Ives was
not aware of any abuses at his Griffith Ives Co. ranch in Somis, in
Ventura County about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   The indictment alleges that Ives supervised the ranch operation
and on one occasion personally recruited an undocumented worker and
told another that he could not leave the ranch until his smuggling
fees were paid.
   Prosecutors maintain the workers toiled 16 hours a day for a
fraction of the $4.25-per-hour minimum wage. In addition, workers
were required to buy food and basic staples from a company store at
inflated prices, the indictment said.
   ``As a result of these deductions, the alien workers often
received net pay for over 160 hours of work in a 15-day period of
less than $100, and in some cases, actually no pay, because the
deductions exceeded the amount of the paycheck,'' the indictment
said.
   One worker allegedly suffered permanent head and back injuries
during a beating. Ives refused to pay for treatment in the United
States and instead gave the worker $100 to help pay for treatment
in Mexico, the indictment said.
   Also named in the indictment were Pedro Pinzon, 30, Rony Havive,
30, Alvaro Ruiz, 39, Josue David Pinzon, 23, and the alleged
smuggler, Mauro Casares, 64.

   A 12-year-old Nevada girl misspelled the word
``irreducible'' today to become the first youngster eliminated from
the 63rd annual National Spelling Bee.
   Aimee Baumann, a sixth grader at Carson Valley Middle School in
Gardnerville, Nev., put an ``a'' instead of the second ``i'' in the
word.
   Baumann, the 15th contestant, and seven others were eliminated
in the first round of the two-day contest that drew a record 226
local champions from across the nation.
   The second round began with 218 youngsters.
   Cheryl Caprio, 14, of Grand Island, N.Y., misspelled
``thoracic,'' which is related to the area of the body between the
neck and abdomen. The 51st contestant, Caprio incorrectly spelled
the word as ``therassic.''
   Lori Kensel, 11, of Tampa, Fla., misspelled ``opulent,'' while
Taylor West, 11, of Altavista, Va., incorrectly spelled
``leasable.''
   About an hour into the contest, Jessamyn Tracy, 13, Anchorage,
Alaska, misspelled ``leopardess,'' a female leopard.
   Three others eliminated in the first round were Kristin Cashore,
13, Dallas, Pa.; Christa Logsdon, 12, New Washington, Ohio and Mark
Weinsier, 13, of Plantation, Fla.
   Three researchers in November put together a list of 1,000 words
for the bee, knowing that 903 words were needed before 14-year-old
Scott Isaacs of Englewood, Colo., won the 1989 competition.
   A total of $26,550 in cash prizes will be awarded by program
sponsor Scripps Howard. First prize includes $5,000, a trophy cup
and special prizes from Encyclopaedia Britannica. The program also
is sponsored by 208 daily, weekly and Sunday newspapers in 47
states.
   The 226 local champions, the most in the history of the program,
include four-time contestant Kanika Bahl, 14, of Beavercreek, Ohio,
and 9-year-old Erika Harrell of Muncie, Ind., the youngest.
   Bahl, an eighth-grader at Ankeney Junior High School, is the
daughter of a physicist. She is the only speller to compete four
times for the title. Five contestants will be competing for the
third time, and 35 spellers are making their second appearance.
   While Harrell is the only fourth-grader competing, there were
sixteen fifth-graders and 31 sixth-graders. The 9-year-old Harrell
attends North View Elementary School in Muncie, Ind., and lists
math and science as her favorite subjects. Both her parents are
teachers.
   To get to the nation's capital this year, the 127 girls and 99
boys competed against nearly 9 million students at the local level,
including Alaska and Hawaii, the District of Columbia, Guam,
Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Department of Defense
Schools.
   Last year 222 youngsters competed in the national bee.

<HEAD>Illinois NOW Recommends Simon Endorsement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the Illinois National
Organization for Women says the group's endorsement of Sen. Paul
Simon was only intended as a recommendation to the national NOW.
   On Tuesday, Illinois NOW President Kim Villanueva said the
group's state political action committee ``enthusiastically and
wholeheartedly endorses Paul Simon in his re-election campaign''
against Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill.
   But later Tuesday, national NOW President Molly Yard issued a
statement saying, ``The only NOW group authorized to endorse in
federal elections is the National NOW PAC.''
   Informed of Yard's statement, Villanueva said Illinois NOW
actually was recommending that NOW's national political action
committee endorse Simon, a Democrat.
   ``I think that was an inaccuracy on my part,'' Villanueva said
Tuesday. ``... I should have explained it further.''
   Yard said the National NOW PAC would consider the Illinois
group's recommendation for a Simon endorsement at its next meeting.
   The Senate race in Illinois has posed a problem for women's
groups, who have to choose between a woman and a male longtime ally.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League on Tuesday endorsed
Simon because of his strong pro-choice stand, spokeswoman Renee
Cravens said. Simon is a co-sponsor of a bill that would write the
U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision into federal law.
   ``Paul Simon is a strong leader in the Senate, and we want to
keep him there,'' Cravens said.
   At the NOW news conference, Simon said he has a stronger record
on women's issues than Martin.
   ``Independent women's groups are looking at the record of both
Lynn Martin and myself, and to my knowledge, every independent
women's group that is taking a stand is either endorsing me or
staying neutral,'' Simon said.
   Reacting to the Illinois NOW's recommended endorsement of Simon,
Martin said: ``Throughout my years in Congress, I have never
received the endorsement of Illinois NOW.
   ``If I must support mandated quotas, budget-busting amendments
and other extreme positions, as NOW does, in order to win their
endorsement, then hats off to Paul Simon.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says California-Based Evangelist May Buy PTL Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California-based evangelist may be the
next owner of the defunct PTL ministry's assets, including its
satellite TV network and the Heritage USA Christian retreat, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer quoted unidentified sources as
saying Morris Cerullo, 58, an Assemblies of God pastor who heads
Worldwide Evangelism Inc., based in San Diego, has offered $52
million for PTL's remaining assets.
   Cerullo's organization also has branches in Great Britain,
Canada, Israel and Zimbabwe.
   A woman who answered the phone at Cerullo's organization today
said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment.
``He's not available and I have no one else who is available,''
said the woman, who declined to give her name.
   PTL bankruptcy trustee Dennis Shedd did not immediately return a
call today. He has confirmed he is negotiating with a ``major
party.''
   Earlier this month, Shedd signed a contract to sell PTL's
television network to evangelist Oral Roberts for $6 million unless
someone else agreed to buy all the assets as a package deal.
   Shedd was scheduled to ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Thurmond Bishop
on Thursday to approve the contract with Roberts. But he said that
if he accepts the broader offer he will recommend throwing out the
Roberts deal.
   The Home Box Office cable television network has asked the
Bankruptcy Court in Columbia to block the sale to Roberts, saying
it doubts he has the resources to make the $242,000 monthly lease
payments for the use of a satellite controlled by HBO.
   In court papers, HBO cited the ``widely reported economic
turmoil of the Oral Roberts organization.'' HBO also argued that
Shedd had no right to transfer the satellite lease.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, two
months after founder Jim Bakker resigned in the wake of a
sex-and-money scandal involving church secretary Jessica Hahn.
Bakker is serving a 45-year term in a federal prison at Rochester,
Minn., on convictions last year of fraud and conspiracy.
   Although the PTL network still operates, carrying other
evangelists' programs, Heritage USA has been closed since
September. The 500-acre retreat near Fort Mill has five
restaurants, a $10 million water park and two 500-room hotels, one
of them unfinished. It also includes about 1,700 undeveloped acres.
   Last year, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick failed to close
on his $65 million deal to buy PTL because he could not get title
insurance for the Heritage USA property. The land is part of an
unsettled claim by the Catawba Indians, who have filed suit
contending 144,000 acres of land was illegally sold to the state in
1840.

<TEXT>
   The Contra rebels agreed today to
resume disbanding after the new government promised to set aside
rural areas where they can live, police themselves and join town
councils.
   The agreement was contained in an accord drafted by the
government and Contras on Tuesday night and signed early today.
   The Contras agreed to try to finish disbanding by June 10, a
deadline set in a May 19 accord the government of President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   That accord broke down when the Contras stopped disarming,
saying the Chamorro government was not fulfillig its commitments to
provide food, housing, jobs and security for fighters who lay down
their weapons.
   On Tuesday, the rebels and the government resumed talks,
suspended Friday after the guerrillas announced an alleged massacre
of 14 disbanded fighters. No evidence of any such attack has
surfaced.
   ``There were misunderstandings, but misunderstandings are solved
by talking, and what we want as Nicaraguans ... is peace and
reconciliation,'' Chamorro said at a dawn news conference.
   Israel Galeano, the top Contra commander, said there was no
reason the demobilization should not resume. The U.S.-backed rebels
fought a nine-year war with the former leftist Sandinista
government, which left office on April 25.
   Under the agreement announced late Tuesday but signed today, the
rebels were to demobilize a ``considerable'' number of combatants
in honor of Mother's Day, celebrated today in Nicaragua.
   They also said they would demobilize at least 100 rebels a day
in each of the five security zones where the 13,000-strong
guerrilla force has concentrated. If the deadline is to be met,
however, the number of rebels disarming would have to be at least
200 daily in each zone.
   So far, fewer than 2,000 rebels have turned in their weapons to
United Nations and Organization of American States missions
supervising the demobilization process.
   In exchange for the demobilization, the government agreed to
establish more than 20 rural development centers. Rebels, who are
largely peasants, will also be given priority in recovering
farmlands confiscated by the Sandinistas.
   Under the latest accord, a police force staffed by demobilized
combatants will be created immediately. The force, which will
police only development centers, will fall under the Goverment
Ministry.
   The Contras were to be represented in the government of
resettlement areas. They were also to be represented in government
ministries that deal with the resettlements.
   In the development zones, the rebels are to integrate themselves
back into peaceful civilian life. Most of the zones will be in war
zones around the country, but the exact areas have not yet been
determined.

   A key Soviet military figure was bound for
Washington today in an 11th-hour drive to forge agreements on
nuclear and conventional weapons for President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to announce at their summit meeting.
   The imminent arrival of Col. Gen. Labronislav Omelichev, first
deputy on the Soviet defense ministry's general staff, was viewed
by U.S. officials as a move by Moscow to settle some of the issues
that have eluded U.S. and Soviet negotiators over four days of
talks.
   Omelichev, a specialist on strategic nuclear weapons, was
considered instrumental in the headway the two superpowers made in
negotiations here in February.
   The current negotiations at the State Department got a
pre-summit boost on Tuesday with an agreement on how to define
tanks and armored personnel carriers. This will help in carrying
out cutbacks in U.S. and Soviet arsenals in Europe and also in
verifying compliance with an eventual arms reduction treaty.
   But U.S. officials, disclosing Omelichev's imminent arrival,
said there was no breakthrough on a half-dozen strategic nuclear
weapons issues. Nor, they said, have the negotiators settled on a
definition of combat aircraft, the key sticking point in the
conventional arms arena, despite the presence of the top Soviet
negotiator, Oleg A. Grinevsky.
   There is ample agreement on enough strategic weapons reductions
to allow Bush and Gorbachev to issue a declaration during the
four-day summit, which begins on Thursday.
   Bush also intends to press the Soviet leader to revitalize the
stalled negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Warsaw Pact in Vienna, Austria, on reductions in troops and
non-nuclear weapons.
   Apart from disagreement over combat aircraft _ the United States
is pushing to limit planes that the Soviets insist are defensive in
nature _ the Soviets are reluctant to complete the accord without
assurances that a unified Germany would not pose a threat to peace
in Europe.
   U.S. officials, insisting on anonymity, said Bush was prepared
to tell the Soviet leader that the Western allies would consider
limits on the new German army but only as part of a deal in which
Soviet troops would be curbed within the Soviet Union.

   Milwaukee's Roman Catholic Archbishop Rembert
G. Weakland says the latest draft of the proposed U.S. bishops'
pastoral letter on women is so unsatisfactorey that it might as
well be abandoned.
   In a column in the archdiocesan weekly, Catholic Herald, he said
the ``very credibility of the document comes into question'' in
treating the issue of women's ordination.
   He said that the document emphasizes women's equality, but fails
to deal with the traditional link between church authority and
ordination, a role the document rejects for women, as does the pope.
   ``It is easy to see the bind the authors are in,'' Weakland
wrote. However, since the letter avoids a basic question involved,
he suggested dropping the effort.

   ``We are counting on faith that the additional $100,000 will

<HEAD>Durenberger Discloses Vacations, Loans in Senate Financial Report</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. David Durenberger, one of seven senators
facing ethics investigations, today disclosed that he accepted free
lodging at the Florida condominium of a friend for each of the past
three winters.
   Durenberger said he accepted the Christmastime gifts from Robert
Windom, a former official in the Department of Health and Human
Services. Aides said the gifts were inadvertently omitted from
financial information material the Minnesota Republican filed in
previous years.
   Durenberger disclosed the vacation gifts as he and 99 other
senators made an annual public accounting of their finances.
   As in previous years, lawmakers reported accepting thousands of
dollars in speaking fees to supplement their salary. Also disclosed
were hundreds of trips, many abroad, for which lawmakers were
reimbursed by special interests, political organizations and think
tanks.
   The reports also show that Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell boosted his income by $50,000 last year by making paid
speeches while Republican leader Bob Dole more than doubled that by
accepting $108,900 in honoraria.
   Mitchell donated $11,000 of his honoraria to charity to keep
within Senate standards for outside income while Dole gave away
$73,150 to fall below the limits, the reports show.
   Dole reported assets worth considerably more than Mitchell's but
the worth of both was dwarfed by the numerous multimillionaires in
the Senate, workplace of a Rockefeller, Kennedy and the several
heirs to family fortunes.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., for example, reported assets valued at
$13.7 million to $17.25 million or higher, among them 45 holdings
listed as being worth ``over $250,000.'' Large blocks of stock in
the food giant H.J. Heinz Co. are a considerable chunk of his
holdings.
   In addition to the vacation stays, Durenberger's amendments
reported a $484,000 loan he had not previously disclosed in his
Senate reports but which has been previously reported in the media.
   Durenberger reported accepting $62,185 in honoraria last year,
and said he gave $26,400 to charity to meet Senate limits for
keeping honoraria.
   Another of the members under investigation, California Democrat
Alan Cranston, reported accepting no honoraria last year in keeping
with a pledge he made in late 1988. Cranston's investment and real
estate holdings supplemented his $89,500 Senate salary handsomely,
and he also reported being reimbursed for trips to Jamaica,
Switzerland and Yugoslavia.
   Mitchell's report shows him to be a man of relatively modest
assets. He kept $39,000 of his honoraria to supplement his $99,500
annual Senate salary and received a $5,000 award from Bowdoin
College in his native Maine.
   Besides his Washington home, which Mitchell said was purchsed in
late 1988 for $320,000, his only reported assets were bank accounts
worth from $17,005 to $55,000. He said he had no liabilities.
Mitchel reported reimbursements for 15 trips, all within the United
States and several to speak to Democratic Party groups. He also was
paid $22,500 in book royalties.
   Dole reported assets worth $345,297 to $809,277 and no
liabilities. The value of the assets cannot be determined precisely
because members are required to list their worth only in ranges.
For example, an asset worth $10,000 would be listed only as being
worth $5,001 to $15,000 and a $1 million asset as being worth
``over $250,000.'' His $108,900 in 1989 honoraria was up from
$67,750 in 1988, when he gave $31,750 to charity.
   This is the last year House member can accept honoraria, but the
Senate has not taken any action to end the controversial practice.
House members were allowed to keep honoraria up to 30 percent of
their salary, or $26,850 for most members. Senators can keep up to
40 percent of their salary, $35,800 for most members and $39,800
for members of the leadership.
   As majority whip, Cranston falls third in the Democratic
leadership, behind Mitchell and Senate President Pro Tempore Robert
Byrd.
   Cranston, one of the so-called ``Keating Five'' under
investigation for intervening with regulators on behalf of
California savings and loan owner Charles Keating, announced in
late 1988 he no longer would accept honoraria.
   The California Democrat reported 1989 income of $330,797 to
$571,485, supplementing his $89,500 Senate salary with rent,
interest and dividends from investments and real estate holdings.
He also received $18,253 in Social Security benefits. Also among
his assets was a blind trust valued at ``over $250,000.''
   Byrd, on the other hand, reported 1989 income of $132,203 to
$154,693, supplementing his $99,500 Senate salary with $19,500 in
honoraria. He also received $120.80 in royalties for a country
music record on which he plays fiddle and said he accepted a
rocking chair valued at $465 from the West Virginia Forestry
Association.
   Dole's top deputy, Republican Whip Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming,
reported 1989 income of $229,900 to $248,100. He said he accepted
$90,600 and gave $55,100 of that total to charity. Simpson was paid
$40,000 to do the ``Face Off'' radio program he conducts with Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.

   May 29
   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission:
   A recent U.S. Supreme Court decision should slap some sense into
Congress about the Frankenstein monster of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. ...
   Voting 9-0, the court struck down California regulations aimed
at assuring survival of trout in the American River and Rock Creek,
a small tributary.
   The court said the Federal Power Act preempts California's
stream-flow regulations.
   So, with one fell swoop of the pen, California, its citizens and
its elected representatives have no say over their wildlife or
streams or the environment they live in if FERC has an interest in
the matter.
   That cannot possibly be the intent of Congress. That FERC can
decide the fate of fish and wildlife in a state without the
citizens' input runs counter to the most basic notions of civil
government. That's fascism.
   Congress must rein in this agency-run-amok.

   Los Angeles Times on clean air bills:
   Two versions of a federal Clean Air Act now heading for
conference on Capitol Hill should make many Americans breathe
easier. ...
   (F)or now, and for (President) Bush, the 401-20 House vote for
the bill _ with his marks all over it _ is the tidiest victory of
his presidency. ...
   And Bush got everything he asked for, and then some.
   Both the Senate and House approved the pioneering program to
control acid rain that is killing lakes and forests in Canada and
the northeastern United States. ...
   Both bills call for 10-million-ton reductions in sulfur dioxide
emissions.
   Both versions went along with the Bush idea to give utilities
that make an extra effort to cut emissions pollution credits that
they could save for future use or sell to other companies.
   And toxic emissions from chemical plants and other polluters
would fall by as much as 70 percent to 90 percent. ...
   In one example of what makes the House bill by far the
preferable one, the Senate version dictates precisely how crude oil
must be refined to make cleaner gasoline. (It seems when
politicians start practicing chemistry, strange things happen.) The
Senate formula would, in effect, make carbon-monoxide-reducing
ethanol, most commonly make from corn, the only gasoline additive
that could raise its oxygen content to stipulated levels. This
might make senators from corn states more interested in clean air.
But ethanol also increases emissions of the basic ingredients of
smog, and for Southern California and many other urban areas, that
is bad. ...
   The bills could cost American industry and consumers $20 billion
a year, so writing the Clean Air Act was a bruising process. And
it's not over yet.
   But at this point, it looks like winners all around.

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on Wellesley students
protesting Barbara Bush as their commencement speaker:
   A group of seniors at Wellesley College gave the nation's
newspaper columnists an early Christmas a few weeks ago by
expressing their patrician outrage at the selection of Barbara Bush
as commencement speaker at the Massachusetts school. They
petitioned school officials to boot the first lady off the platform
arousing a furious chorus of howls from the columnists.
   How exactly did they do it? They said this:
   ``Wellesley teaches us that we will be rewarded on the basis of
our own merit, not that of a spouse. To honor Barbara Bush as a
commencement speaker is to honor a woman who has gained recognition
through the achievements of her husband, which contradicts what we
have been taught over the last four years at Wellesley.''
   The customary response to this irritating sneer has been to
point out that Mrs. Bush left Smith College to become a wife and
mother and a homemaker, and if that isn't what America's all about,
by golly, then what is?
   If the Wellesley seniors are saying they'd never stoop so low to
marry a millionaire and don't want to listen to a lady who did,
well, fine. They're certainly more intellectually consistent than
their college's administration. If they're saying that they wish to
consider only the sort of futures and realities in which they, not
husbands, will be at center stage, well, that's their prerogative.

   Shawano (Wis.) Evening Leader on standards for door openers:
   It's time for the federal government to impose standards on
automatic garage door openers.
   Too many of these openers are killing and maiming youngsters
throughout the United States.
   Currently, manufacturers of garage door openers are not required
to meet Underwriter Laboratory standards for automatic reverses.
Such mechanisms automatically reverse the downward motion of garage
doors if something impedes their progress.
   Most of the time, the item struck by the closing garage door is
a bike or a ball or some other object. In increasingly alarming
numbers, however, children are being caught under the doors.
   When functional reverses are in place, the garage door pops
right back up and little damage is done. Yet some experts think
that up to 50 percent _ or half of all automatic garage doors
installed in the U.S. today _ do not have reverses, or have
reverses that for one reason or another are not in working
condition.
   As more homeowners install automatic garage door openers, the
danger to children increases. To deal with this growing problem and
prevent future harm, we believe the U.S. Products Safety Commission
should mandate standards for reversing mechanisms on all new
automatic garage door openers.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Radio Free Europe:
   There's been some talk in Washington lately about closing Radio
Free Europe. The notion behind this is that Eastern and Central
Europe's democratic revolutions are so well entrenched that the
need for an honest and pro-democratic voice to beam news about
national and regional events into the area is no longer necessary.
   That's ridiculous.
   Soviet troops still reside in much of the region. Indeed, it was
recently disclosed that the modest withdrawal of Soviet troops from
East Germany that had been under way has been suspended _ without
explanation. At the same time, Soviets have made contradictory
remarks about arms-control negotiations.
   And perhaps most ominous is that communist bureaucrats of
totalitarian and conspiratorial bent are still comfortably in place
throughout Eastern Europe. Many are doing what they can to sabotage
the political and economic reforms being attempted by the democrats
who are officially in charge of these bureaucracies. ...
   The Voice of America, chartered to tell the story of the United
States abroad, does a fine job, but it isn't specifically organized
to promote democracy in Eastern and Central Europe. For that task,
the region still needs Radio Free Europe, which has been a
messenger of hope to millions of people.

   Le Monde, Paris, on Colombia's elections:
   Colombia has taken a gamble. This little country, despite
decades of blind violence, has decided to remain faithful to its
democratic principles. ...
   Especially for the drug traffickers, Cesar Gaviria's victory is
a challenge. A deadly challenge, because alone among the
candidates, Cesar Gaviria promised a ``battle without mercy.'' The
others spoke of ``dialogue'' or even of ending the ``caprices of
the United States,'' meaning the extradition of the traffickers. ...
   The government cannot be ready to do battle against this
redoubtable adversary when Colombians' sacrifices are rendered
futile by a lack of international solidarity. It was no accident
that the first appeal of the future president was to Washington:
``What can we do when the (drug) consuming countries do nothing?''

   Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on statements about Korea by Emperor
Akihito and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu:
   The apology clarified it was Japan that had caused the
unfortunate past, and a feeling of pain and regret for hurting
Korean people was indicated as the emperor's honest feeling.
   Behind the prime minister's comments is an apology from each
Japanese national ... and a severe sense of self-criticism. ...
   However, it is not a problem that only words can solve. Japan
should have 120 percent understanding of the past, and promise the
establishment of fruitful partnership between Japan and South Korea.
   We need to realize that we only reached the starting point where
we should begin solving the core problems left between Japan and
South Korea. ...
   It is natural for Koreans to think that Japan has never felt
pains of victims or guilt as the assailant because Japan has been
lazily delaying solution while showing no sincere efforts. ...
   The important thing is to have a firm recognition of history and
an effort to pass it to the next generation, which is largely
missing here. ...
   We need education to have people learn true history.

   The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on Saturday's parliamentary
election in Burma:
   While there was widespread pessimism at first that the election
would be far from ``free and fair'' ... early reports ... indicated
minimal intimidation or vote rigging in the polls that could leave
the National League for Democracy of Aung San Suu Kyi with a
majority.
   This is as much a resounding victory for the NLD as a damning
testimony against the military dictatorship of Gen. Saw Maung which
seized power in a coup in September 1988 that left thousands of
pro-democracy demonstrators dead.
   Loudly and clearly the people in Burma are airing their desire
to end the choking status quo.
   They have done this legally through the ballot.
   Now that the military has allowed the world to see what the
majority of people really desire they have placed themselves in the
open.
   The ball now is in the court of the military. After so many
years in power the military apparatus is in a consolidated position
of privilege.
   Even if they want to give up their rule they will want a
guarantee that they would not be left out in the cold.
   The NLD landslide triumph and the euphoria of the people should
not necessarily be considered the end of the repressive period. It
is in fact the beginning of the ordeal over how Burma will develop
so that the people and the military can coexist peacefully without
fear or repression.

   The Indian Express, New Delhi, on the Burma election:
   The people of (Burma) have repudiated the ruling military junta
in no uncertain terms in the just-concluded elections. But the
establishment soon of a genuine democratic set-up for which they
have given a resounding vote cannot still be taken for granted.
   In 1988, the popular uprising was drowned in blood, with the
champion of Burmese socialism, Gen. Ne Win, stepping down only to
pull the wool over the people and enable another military dictator,
Gen. Saw Maung, to continue to rule with an iron hand. Now, with
the National League for Democracy led by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi
heading for a two-thirds majority in a new 485-member legislature,
as conceded even by the hated miliitary rulers, grave doubts about
their true intentions have arisen.
   If the game of these tyrants-in-a-democratic-guise is to be
foiled, the world powers, in particular, the United States and
Japan, must put economic diplomacy to good effect.
   A heartening development is that the U.S. Senate has recently
voted 92-0 to ban all imports from (Burma). ... It is to be hoped
that the U.S. House of Representatives, too, will likewise exert
presure on the Bush administration to ensure that the people are
not denied the fruits of their clear-cut verdict.

   An arson fire early today was confined to one
room of an apartment, but it killed five children and an adult,
city fire officials said.
   ``It was definitely a set fire,'' said fire department spokesman
Tom Sheppard.
   The fire apparently started on a mattress in the living room on
the second floor of the two-story apartment building, said First
District Deputy Fire Chief William Nolan.
   The fire was confined to that room, but that was where all the
bodies were found, he said.
   Nolan said a gasoline can was found in the apartment's dining
room and that a preliminary investigation found evidence of
gasoline in the living room and dining room.
   The victims were Hermino Elricalde, 36, and his daughters,
Greta, 16, and Laura, 15, said Sheppard. Also dead were Vernice
Garcia, 10; Clara Garcia, 9; and Joel Garcia, 8, believed to be the
children of Elricalde's girlfriend, who was not home at the time of
the fire, he said.

It said the unidentified snake charmer was carrying at least six

   The state-run railroad, recently hit by a
crippling strike, will double passenger fares Friday, the official
PAP news agency reported.
   The fare increases were planned before the labor strife broke
out May 20, railway spokesman Tadeusz Bronowski told PAP on
Wednesday. He said the increases are due to higher fuel and
operating costs, and the cut in state subsidies under the
government's economic reform program.
   Typical of Poland's state industries, the railroad had used
large government subsidies to keep fares unrealistically low. For
example, a first-class ticket for the three-hour express train ride
from Warsaw to Gdansk has cost about $3.
   Wildcat strikers snarled freight and passenger service to
northwest Poland from May 20 until Monday, when Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa persuaded the workers to return to work and give the
government until June 13 to consider their demands for higher pay.

   A U.S. Navy ship rescued 101
Vietnamese refugees from two boats in the South China Sea after
spotting smoke signals and a white flag flying from one of the
vessels, a Navy spokesman said Wednesday.
   The Beaufort, a Navy salvage and rescue vessel based in Sasebo,
Japan, was en route to the Philippines when it came upon the wooden
boats last week, said Robert Coble, a spokesman from the Subic Bay
Naval Base in the Philippines.
   The Beaufort arrived at Subic on Wednesday morning, and base
authorities were negotiating with Philippine and U.N. refugee
officials to allow the refugees to disembark, Coble said.
   Coble said the Beaufort's captain picked up the refugees after
concluding that both wooden boats were ``unseaworthy and did not
have much provisions.''
   He said the Beaufort's crew on May 24 found a 21-foot wooden
boat with 24 people, including nine children, after spotting smoke
signals and a white flag on the vessel.
   The refugees had no water, a little rice, and had been at sea
for seven days after sailing from Tien Giang through the Mekong
River and into the South China Sea, Coble said.
   The refugees said pirates had robbed them of money and jewelry,
he added.
   Two days later, the Beaufort found a slightly larger boat with
77 people on board.
   Philippine officials said many of the refugees were suffering
from dehydration and malnutrition.

<HEAD>Naval Academy To Expel Middies Found Guilty of Physical Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following weeks of intense congressional
and media attention, the U.S. Naval Academy has announced new
regulations to halt physical and mental abuse of freshmen.
   Under the new rules, any midshipmen found guilty of physical
abuse of freshmen, or plebes, during indoctrination could be
expelled, even if the act falls short of what is considered hazing.
   Tuesday's order follows weeks of intense attention and calls for
investigations into reports of student abuse, including that of
19-year-old Gwen Marie Dreyer of Encinitas, Calif.
   She resigned from the academy last month after male midshipmen
handcuffed her to a urinal, taunted and photographed her.
   Tuesday's general order by the academy superintendent, Rear Adm.
Virgil L. Hill Jr., also calls for increased demerits and
restrictions for forcing a fellow upperclassman to engage in
horseplay.
   ``Up to now the maximum punishment would be restriction and
demerits. What we've done is elevate violation rules governing
physical contact to a dismissal,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Mark Van Dyke,
academy spokesman. ``We try very hard to prevent violations of
human rights, but we also accept the fact that mistakes will happen.
   ``These actions are being taken to underscore the determination
that the superintendent, and the other academy leadership have to
keep these problems in check.''
   The order came one day after 35 people, organized by the Anne
Arundel County chapter of the National Organization for Women,
demonstrated outside the academy during the annual graduation ball.
   The protesters called for tougher punishment for behavior that
amounts to ``acts of terrorism,'' specifically complaining that the
middies who handcuffed Dreyer were only reprimanded.
   Van Dyke declined to say if the midshipmen who taunted Dreyer
would have been dismissed under the new rules, saying the case is
still under review. He also declined to say if their dismissal was
still a possibility.
   Van Dyke noted that hazing, which has been prohibited for almost
100 years, already carries the penalty of expulsion.
   The freshmen indoctrination manual defines hazing as any
``unauthorized assumption of authority by a midshipman,'' such as
an older student subjecting a freshman to cruelty, undue
humiliation, hardship or ``oppression or the deprivation or
abridgement of any right.''
   Plebe indoctrination is part of the required training of a
first-year student, Van Dyke said. It includes, for example,
``chopping,'' in which a plebe must walk double time, can't talk
and must make a 90-degree turn at every corner.
   ``It's designed to apply stress and teach them to obey strict
orders. But that's not hazing,'' Van Dyke said. ``If you had
someone chopping through the halls and the plebe is grabbed by a
midshipman, that's a dismissal offense.''
   Women have been admitted to the nation's service academies since
1976. At Annapolis, they account for a little more than 10 percent
of this year's graduating class of about 1,000.
   At the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, 100 women are among
the 971 graduates. There are 89 women in this year's graduating
class of about 900 at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.

   Without a presidential candidate in sight,
Democrats leapt ahead today with 1992 convention preparations by
designating New Orleans and New York as finalists in the
competition for the party's nominating session.
   ``This is a wide-open process,'' party chairman Ronald H. Brown
said after receiving the recommendation from the convention site
selection committee. The convention is scheduled to run from July
16 through July 19, 1992.
   Brown said he would visit both cities within the next week or
two and expected ``some tough negotiations'' before making the
final decision.
   At this point, Brown said, ``I don't have a personal choice.''
   He said he doesn't believe the location of the convention has
any particular political significance in a presidential campaign.
   ``It is not where the convention is held, but what is said from
the podium,'' Brown said.
   The Republicans are receiving bids for their 1992 convention and
plan to announce their decision in January. While the GOP will
visit potential sites and weigh their bids, President Bush could
make those efforts academic if he decides to express a choice.
   New Orleans was the site of the 1988 GOP convention that
nominated Bush for president.
   The 1976 Democratic convention that nominated Jimmy Carter, the
last Democrat to win a national election, was held in New York.
   Some senior Democrats have recently expressed concern about the
lack of activity by potential 1992 presidential candidates. So far
no Democrat is expressing any interest in challenging Bush for
re-election and none is engaging in the sort of covert early
maneuvering usually picked up at this early stage.
   ``Normally at this stage of the game you would have least one or
two out making all the body language, doing the fund-raising,
denying they were a candidate,'' said former party chairman John
White.
   The 46-member site-selection committee visited four cities this
year, including the two finalists, Houston and Cleveland.
   The Cleveland presentation impressed the panel with its
enthusiasm. The city's convention hall in suburban Brook Park was
described as the equal or better than the facilities in competing
cities. But Cleveland's shortage of nearby hotel rooms was a fatal
handicap.
   ``I think we were taken seriously this time which gives us a
real chance in '96,'' said Ohio Democratic Party chairman James
Ruvolo.
   The Democrats want unlimited access to the hall for six weeks
before the opening of the convention and a commitment of $15
million in support services to include police protection and rental
of the facility.
   The convention is expected to attract 35,000 people and millions
of dollars in economic benefits. Atlanta was estimated to have
gained about $70 million from the 1988 convention that nominated
Michael Dukakis for president.
   New York made the strongest financial bid, offering the
Democrats $22 million in cash and services, plus an enormous
potential for additional fund-raising during the convention. But
Madison Square Garden was regarded by many as too small for the
more than 5,000 delegates and alternates and thousands more
onlookers. City officials offered a plan to provide additional
seating, but several selection committee members were skeptical.
   In addition, the media work space in New York would be in the
Javits Center, half a mile away from the convention site.
   New Orleans had trouble meeting the financial requirements and
is in a state that is a stronghold of the anti-abortion movement,
placing it at odds with the prevailing sentiment of the Democratic
Party. But its Superdome offered more than enough space for the
delegates plus the thousands of news media needing room to work.
   Both cities were able to guarantee plenty of hotel rooms and are
home to some of the nation's best-known restaurants.
   Cities that have expressed interest to the Republicans include
Houston, the city Bush calls his hometown; Kansas City, Mo.; St.
Petersburg, Fla.; and Cleveland. New York and New Orleans also are
regarded as potential bidders. Atlanta expressed early interest but
has since dropped out.

   A search resumed today for two teen-age girls apparently swept
away while wading in a rain-swollen creek in southern Ohio, and
thunderstorms rumbled across north Texas, triggering tornadoes,
hail and flash flooding.
   In North Carolina, a waterspout spawned by heavy thunderstorms
came ashore at a campground Tuesday, lifting a man and his tent
high into the air and dumping him in a marsh 70 feet away,
officials said.
   ``He said it was just like Dorothy and `The Wizard of Oz,'''
said Diana Gardner, spokeswoman for Albemarle Hospital in Elizabeth
City, where John Vergnes was in stable condition with five broken
ribs.
   At least two tornadoes were sighted in northern Texas, one near
Blooming Grove and the other near Paradise. Property damage was
reported near Paradise.
   Five trailer homes were destroyed by high winds in Valley View,
about 55 miles north of Dallas, said Cooke County sheriff's
dispatcher Laurie Butler. One of the homes was destroyed by fire
caused by an electrical short, and a boy suffered a broken arm, Ms.
Butler said.
   Hail pelted several counties, and flash flooding was reported on
U.S. 287 late Tuesday near Decatur, about 30 miles north of Fort
Worth.
   Severe storms raked central Colorado on Tuesday, unleashing
tornadoes and heavy rain. Three tornadoes were spotted in the
Denver area Tuesday afternoon, but they did only minor damage, the
National Weather Service said.
   The resulting wind, lightning and rain tore off shingles, broke
branches and downed power lines, police said.
   Flooding from weekend rain in southern Ohio left part of one
community under 6 feet of water, and flood warnings remained in
effect for several rivers. Gov. Richard Celeste said today he would
declare four southern counties disaster areas, opening the way for
state and possibly federal relief.
   Authorities resumed searching today for 15-year-old Carrie
McFadden and 16-year-old Felicia Smith, feared drowned Tuesday in
Paint Creek in Chillicothe, said sheriff's Sgt. Terry Myers.
   Rescuers in southeast Ohio also searched the Muskingum River
near McConnelsville for a man trapped in a canoe as it passed over
a dam Monday. Two teen-age boys canoeing with Terry Sherman, 24, of
Newark, Ohio, were rescued.
   Residents of Murray City in southeast Ohio were cleaning up from
flash flooding caused by heavy rain Tuesday that left part of the
community under 6 feet of water.
   ``This is all my husband and I own. We don't know where to
start,'' said Helen James, 59, crying as she surveyed damage from 3
feet of water in their one-story house.
   In North Carolina, a dozen other tents at the Outer Banks
campground were destroyed by the waterborne tornado, but only
50-year-old Vergnes was hurt, said campground owner Ward Barnett.
   ``I was lifted very high and the tent was spinning,'' said
Vergnes, of Verona, Pa. ``I could feel the spinning motion and the
upward lift, maybe for three seconds. I was carried across a
channel ... I was stripped completely of my clothes.''

   Angry anti-Communist demonstrators
jostled the mayor of Bucharest this morning as he arrived with
garbage trucks and street sweepers to end their 39-day protest in a
city square.
   Shouting ``Down With Communism!'' and ``Get Out! Get Out!,'' a
group of about 40 demonstrators stood behind a newly reinforced
metal barricade at one end of University Square. They urged Mayor
Dan Predescu to send the equipment elsewhere, where there are piles
of garbage.
   Predescu announced late Tuesday that the city would take ``due
measures'' today to clear the square because the lengthy blockade
has cut off one of the city's main thoroughfares.
   But 10 hours after the mayor arrived, the trucks and sweepers
remained parked just outside the square, which the demonstrators
have declared a ``Communist-Free Zone.'' No move was made to tear
down the barriers and rush-hour traffic continued to detour around
the square.
   A strong earthquake struck Bucharest and other cities today, but
it caused no panic among the demonstrators, said Dr. Dragos
Nicolescu, who has been tending to hunger strikers participating in
the protest.
   ``The demonstrators were swearing at Iliescu when the earthquake
happened,'' Nicolescu said, referring to President-Elect Ion
Iliescu.
   Dan Lungu, 28, who has lost 48 pounds since he started fasting
May 3, said: ``I was praying to God when the earthquake came. It
was as if it was God who was calling us. I could feel that.''
   Pedestrians stopped to watch, shout and occasionally boo the
protesters.
   After a sleepless night waiting for something to happen, the
demonstrators spotted about 10 women street sweepers walking toward
the square at 6:30 a.m., followed by the mayor.
   Several demonstrators rushed toward the mayor, surrounding and
pushing him. One woman hit him on the head with a newspaper and was
pulled away by Octavian Radulescu, a member of the Association of
Former Political Prisoners. He shouted: ``Don't push him, because
that's what they are waiting for.''
   One man yelled: ``Take your communism away from our free zone.''
   The demonstrators' key demand is that former high-ranking
Communists be banned from public office for 10 years. The mayor
insisted he had nothing to do with Iliescu, a former Communist
Party Politburo member who won a landslide victory in May 20
elections.
   Iliescu, who called the protesters ``thugs'' and later
apologized, had ordered the square cleared before the elections.
But Prime Minister Petre Roman said the demonstrators could stay,
even though their protest was unauthorized.
   ``I am not a Communist and I am not a representative for what
Iliescu says. I only want to clean this place. It is my duty,'' the
mayor said.
   Eventually, demonstrators who act as guards for 11 hunger
strikers participating in the protest surrounded Predescu to
protect him. The mayor remained in the square for an hour, arguing
with any protester who approached him.
   Viorica Panaitescu, 64, who was visiting the hunger strikers'
tent camp on the side of the square, said: ``Authorities will be
more and more drastic. It's still the Communists that are leading
us. ... I know they (the hunger strikers) are right, but they must
stop fasting.''
   Shortly before midnight, a drunken man who tried to remove one
of the barricades was surrounded by a group of about 60 nervous
demonstrators. Several punched and beat him and he was taken by
ambulance to a hospital, his face bloody.
   The government released a statement Tuesday night saying it
would do everything possible to stop the hunger strike. Some people
have been fasting for four weeks and the Ministry of Health warned
that they could face irreversible damage.
   Demonstrators have remained split on ending their occupation.
   Six key groups in the square, fearing the hunger strikers might
die, have decided to switch to weekly protests. The Group for
Social Dialogue, Romania's leading intellectuals, backed them,
saying the demonstrators had already won ``a moral victory.'' Other
groups have vowed to remain in the square because their demands
haven't been met.
   Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Teoctist urged the government
Tuesday to start a dialogue with the demonstrators. Several other
attempts to initiate talks have failed.

<HEAD>CNN and CBS To Share Berlin News Bureau</HEAD>

   In a cost-saving test that might be tried
elsewhere overseas, Cable News Network and CBS News will share a
bureau and satellite facilities in Berlin, says CNN executive vice
president Ed Turner.
   The test will start in mid-June and is a ``a limited
experiment'' in which the two organizations will maintain separate
correspondents and producers, he says.
   CBS News spokesman Tom Goodman said Wednesday the network had no
comment on what would be a unique sharing of office space with a
still-growing cable rival.
   Although an experiment and on a small scale, the Berlin bureau
arrangement would be the second deal between CBS and a company
owned by Atlanta cable tycoon Ted Turner, who tried to buy CBS in
1986.
   Last September, Turner Network Television announced a $50
million contract with CBS that lets TNT show 50 hours of coverage
from the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS owns the U.S.
television rights to those Games.
   The CNN-CBS News arrangement in Berlin is ``really more symbolic
than anything else,'' Ed Turner, no relation to CNN's owner, said
in an interview last week.
   What is unusual about it is two rival TV news organizations
``cohabiting under the same roof and sharing a (satellite) feed
point and saving each other a little money,'' he said. ``And we'll
see where it goes from there.''
   Asked if there might be similar CBS-CNN arrangements elsewhere
overseas, Turner replied that ``We're looking at some, but right
now there's nothing to talk about.''
   The cost-saving effort comes at a time all the major networks
are trying to reduce or share costs of news coverage overseas.
   Several years ago, NBC bought nearly 38 percent of Visnews, a
London-based overseas TV news service. Visnews' majority owner is
the Reuters news company, but the British Broadcasting Corp. also
owns an 11.25 percent interest.
   NBC and Visnews recently began sharing the same office in
Moscow, and the BBC uses NBC's satellite facilities there to
transmit its stories to London, according to NBC.
   ABC owns 45 percent of another London-based overseas TV news
service, Worldwide Television News, whose subscribers include ABC
News, CBS News and CNN.

   Mikhail Gorbachev, a politician in deep
trouble back home, could get plenty of advice from this town's
political consultants.
   They'd tell him: Open a negative campaign against Boris Yeltsin,
do something, almost anything, to satisfy a Soviet
``what-have-you-done-for-me-today mentality'' _ and get rid of that
dreadful red flag.
   When Washington's practitioners of public relations and campaign
consulting were asked what they would tell the visiting Soviet
president if he were a client, they didn't hesitate.
   Gorbachev's political problems _ breakaway republics; the
election of critic Yeltsin as president of Russia, the largest
Soviet republic; bloody clashes in Armenia; panic buying in the
stores _ weren't enough to faze most of the imagemasters.
   ``The thing he can't do is lose the initiative,'' said Jody
Powell, former press secretary to President Jimmy Carter and now
with Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the p.r. firm. ``He's got to keep being in
motion and doing things and making sure the people are reacting to
him rather than the other way around.''
   Another veteran of the Carter White House, Anne Wexler, now
running a government relations firm, shares that view. ``If I were
advising him on anything,'' she said, ``I'd say move ahead
briskly.''
   Consultant Bob Beckel, adviser to Democrats, agreed. ``Gorbachev
understands he has to come up with one big bomb after another.
Three yards and a cloud of dust is not for him.''
   Beckel said he is just the man to advise Gorbachev: ``Since I
ran Walter Mondale's campaign, you know I know what it is like to
bring bad news to the boss.''
   Roger Stone, who has earned a living offering tips to Richard
Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush, thinks Gorbachev made a big
mistake with that long-faced television speech Sunday night
imploring his people ``not to give in to panic.''
   Gorbachev went on the air as waves of consumers swept through
state-run stores buying everything in sight to beat sharp announced
price rises.
   ``Austerity has never won an election in this country,'' said
Stone. ``Walter Mondale ran for president saying, `I will raise
your taxes' and you see where that got him. Austerity as a
political message is a loser. If I were Gorbachev, I'd be looking
for deep tax cuts. It worked for Ronald Reagan.''
   Gorbachev's speech got Bob Squire's head shaking, too.
   Squire, an expert for Democrats on using television, said, ``On
TV, he looked like Gorbachev imitating Brezhnev,'' the sour-faced
former Soviet leader.
   ``The problem with that speech is that he looked so grim it
might have induced people to listen to what he was saying, which
would be a disaster,'' said Squire.
   Squire's advice: pick a fight with Yeltsin, whose theme song
ever since he was thrown out of the Soviet leadership in 1987 has
been that Gorbachev was doing too little, too late.
   ``Gorbachev has let Yeltsin become the good guy,'' said Squire.
``Gorbachev needs to focus on policies, not personalities.
Yeltsin's proposals would be much more painful than the reality the
people are facing today. He's got to make Yeltsin the issue.
Gorbachev's problem is he invented the good guy version of Soviet
politics. If you live by your personality, you die by your
personality.''
   Beckel, tongue in cheek, offered this counsel: ``Take an early
pension.''
   And this: ``Maybe he ought to give it up and get himself made
secretary general of the U.N.'' Pause. ``The problem is, the
Russians might veto him.''
   John Buckley, who advises conservatives, says Gorbachev's
problem, short-term anyway, is just about hopeless.
   ``Good policy makes good politics,'' says Buckley. ``No truer
cliche has ever been spoken.''
   Victor Kamber, who runs a p.r. and advertising agency that
serves liberal causes, finds himself agreeing with Buckley. ``All
the great speeches in the world won't help Gorbachev. There's a
what-have-you-done-for-me-today mentality he hasn't dealt with.''
   And after Gorbachev solves all his immediate crisis-sized
problems, Squire offers one last bit of advice: ``He's got to do
something about that awful flag. He's got a blood red flag with a
hammer and sickle on it. He needs a blue flag with a white dove,
something like that. But that can come later.''

<TEXT>
   Agreements ranging from chemical weapons to
air travel will be concluded at the U.S.-Soviet summit, but getting
superpower signatures on big-ticket missile and trade accords is
proving more difficult.
   President Bush's talks with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev starting Thursday are likely to produce a joint
declaration on progress toward agreement on the first treaty to
reduce the number of U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear missiles.
But it's almost certain the treaty will not be ready for signing.
   Expectations for signing a trade agreement to ease U.S. tariffs
on Soviet products also are fading, but better than a half-dozen
separate agreements are ready for signing at a ceremony set for
Friday. Here is a brief rundown on the agreements:
   _An end to production of all U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons,
mainly poison gas and nerve agents, and destruction of all but
5,000 tons of each side's chemical arms stockpiles until a global
production ban is put in place. It is unclear whether this would be
put in the form of a formal treaty requiring ratification by a
two-thirds majority of the Senate or an executive agreement that
would require a simple majority vote by both the House and Senate.
   The agreement is expected to include provisions for each side to
inspect the other side's weapons destruction.
   _A protocol to provide against cheating on existing treaties
that limit nuclear tests. The 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and
the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty limit Soviet and
American underground nuclear tests to a yield of 150 kilotons.
   No agreement is expected on the tougher question of whether to
prohibit all nuclear tests. The Soviets favor such a ban; the Bush
administration opposes it.
   _Expanding commercial air travel between the United States and
the Soviet Union by adding four American and six Soviet cities to
current airliner routes. The deal will allow one more Soviet and
six more U.S. airlines to run the routes, and it will inaugurate
regular cargo flights between the two countries.
   Additional U.S. cities to be provided service are Anchorage,
Alaska; Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. The additional Soviet
cities are Kiev, Minsk, Magadan, Khabarovsk, Tbilisi and Riga, in
Latvia.
   _A new 5-year bilateral atomic energy agreement would provide
for closer cooperation in nuclear reactor safety, fusion energy and
basic atomic science. The deal coincides with heightened
international concern about the safety of some Soviet commercial
nuclear reactors in light of the 1986 Chernobyl accident that
killed at least 31 people.
   _A grain deal, effective Jan. 1, 1991, committing the Soviets to
buy more American wheat, feed grains and soybeans. It guarantees at
least 10 million tons in U.S. sales annually, an increase of 1
million tons annually from the current agreement, which took effect
in 1983.
   _A maritime transportation pact to make it easier for U.S. and
Soviet commercial vessels to deliver goods to ports in one
another's country. The agreement will increase the number of ports
in which the ships can call, and will ease the length of advance
notification time required of the arriving ships.
   The two nations also are likely to conclude a maritime boundary
agreement that recognizes Soviet jurisdiction over four disputed
Arctic islands.
   _Opening reciprocal cultural and information centers in
Washington and Moscow. The centers, one in each city, would offer
student counseling and provide lending library and language
services, as well as sponsor seminars and exhibitions. Some terms
of the agreement were still being negotiated this week.
   _The first government-to-government agreement to increase
student exchanges between the two countries. It sets an exchange
goal of 1,000 students from each country by 1995.

   Thomas J. Schooley, 20, of Evansville was being held Wednesday
on $1,000 bond, authorities said.
   Andrew McNeeley and William O'Leary told police they were robbed
early Tuesday as they came out of an alley, said Detective James
Kelley.
   The man said he had a gun and demanded money. The pair emptied
their pockets and handed over 11 cents. The robber took the change
and ran away, police said.
   McNeeley and O'Leary described the robber to a woman who in turn
told police Schooley's name and address. Schooley was arrested at
his apartment.
   Police said Schooley also was wanted on charges of failure to
appear, theft, receiving stolen property and conspiracy.

   Arab leaders ended their summit Wednesday
with harsh criticism of the United States, saying its support of
Israel encourages the Jewish state to stonewall peace moves and
settle Jews on occupied land.
   Their statement was seen as a major defeat for pro-American
moderates led by Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
   The 20-page final communique urged a halt to the influx of Jews
into Israel and pledged financial and political support for the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied
territories. No figures were made public.
   The communique was released after a three-day summit marked by
disagreement between hard-liners and moderates. PLO chief Yasser
Arafat called the summit to discuss Arab concerns over the
immigration of Soviet Jews to Israel.
   Some last-minute changes were made on the draft text, tempering
an outright threat of economic sanctions, and possibly an oil
embargo, on states that encourage Jewish immigration to Israel.
   Instead, the leaders instructed economic, financial and foreign
ministers of the 21-member Arab League to meet within two months to
reevaluate relations and recommend to the next summit possible
sanctions against states that facilitate immigration to Israel.
   That appeared to be the only concession the hard-liners _ led by
Iraq and the PLO _ made to the moderates.
   Israeli officials have said hundreds of thousands of Jews could
go to Israel in the next few years because of relaxed travel
restrictions in the Soviet Union and tighter entry quotas in the
United States.
   Arabs fear the emigrants will be settled in occupied territories
and drive out the Palestinians.
   The Israeli government denies it has a policy of settling Jewish
emigrants in the occupied territories.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, wearing a silver and white
African robe, spoke to the conference Wednesday and said,
``Palestine will be the graveyard of the Jews.''
   He said Arabs must increase their population from 100 million to
1 billion to confront Israel with a ``population explosion.'' A
recording of his address was broadcast by Baghdad television.
   The final communique said: ``The Arab leaders affirmed that the
Arab powers will take political and economic measures against
whichever country that recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel.''
   It ``denounced'' non-binding recent votes in both chambers of
the U.S. Congress that described Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel. It also warned of an ``explosion'' in the Middle East
because of Israeli policies.
   ``The United States shoulders the main responsibility for this
situation because of the military capabilities, financial
assistance and political cover it extends to Israel, without which
Israel would not have been able to continue its aggression and
challenge of international will,'' the statement said.
   It urged all states to ``stop any assistance or loans that might
facilitate the settlement of Jewish emigrants in occupied
Palestinian or other Arab lands.''
   It askd the United Nations to ``to guarantee that the Jewish
emigrants will not be settled'' in occupied territories. It
demanded ``international supervision'' to guard against the
settlement of Jews on occupied land and to protect Palestinians of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   On other issues, the final communique stressed backing for
``Iraq's legitimate right to self-defense and its right to defend
itself against any aggression with whatever means it sees fit.''
   That was a declaration of support for Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, who has said he would hit Israel with chemical weapons if
it deployed its nuclear arsenal against Iraq or any other Arab
country.
   Iraq has binary chemical weapons. Iraq-bound shipments,
allegedly containing components of an Iraqi ``super gun,'' have
been seized in Britain, Greece, Turkey and Italy.
   An Egyptian suggestion that the summit call for a ``nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons-free Middle East'' was shot down by
hard-liners on grounds that Israel would not make such a commitment.
   The communique also called for a special fund to help rebuild
war-torn Lebanon.
   Syria, Iraq's main Arab foe, boycotted the meeting mainly
because of its venue. Lebanon, which has two-thirds of its
territory under Syrian control, also did not participate.
   The next summit, the communique said, will convene in Egypt in
November.

   One census form came back with tooth marks on
it. Another included a note asking for money. A third simply
included the response ``none of your business.''
   When you send questionnaires out to count a quarter-billion
Americans, chances are not all the responses will be what was
expected.
   ``For wanting to know how many people live in the U.S., you
people are all nosey,'' wrote one woman on her census form.
   ``I thought this was a Census, not a history quiz,'' replied
another.
   And one man methodically wrote ``none of your business'' in
response to each question on his form.
   The census is continuing and people who don't provide
information will likely get a call from their local census
enumerator.
   So far, officials say, just more than 80 percent of American
households have been counted, either in the mail-back portion of
the count or by workers going door-to-door. The effort is expected
to continue for at least several weeks.
   Some enumerators have even resorted to rowboats in flood-ravaged
areas of Texas, reported Census spokesman Jim Wilson in Dallas.
   Many of the people filling out forms are going beyond the limits
of the form's square boxes, however, to express more personal
thoughts about the census and themselves.
   Wilson has been collecting some of the census responses from
across the nation that go beyond the bureaucratic expectations. His
collection includes:
   _A census form with a large chunk missing and teeth marks over
the remainder, with a note saying that the family's golden
retriever had chomped it, and asking for a new form.
   _``The census sounds like an autobiography, not a head count.''
   _``I answered the questions the best I know how, we are two old
people.''
   _``Brad, study and no science questions, notes on bugs, dad can
help.'' (Wilson suggests this note, scrawled on the envelope, may
not have been intended for the Census Bureau).
   _``I am 74, I own this property, that is all I intend to say.''
   _One woman listed her two Pekingese, with a note saying that, to
her, ``these are people, these are not dogs.'' Their language
spoken was listed as Pekingese.
   _One man listed his state of residence as ``confusion.''
   _A woman, apparently annoyed at questions about type of
employment and place of work, included a note stating:
   ``When my husband is home from work and is resting my work still
goes on, I cook the meals, I wash the dishes, I mow the yard, wash
the clothes and hang them on the line, make sure the bills are paid
on time and that the floors are vacuumed or mopped. If this is not
a job I don't know what is.''
   _A man answering the question on commuting to work said his wife
traveled by broom.
   _One respondent included Tinker Bell and Peter Pan as sharing
the household.
   _And a man called a census office to ask if he had been sent a
long form at the instigation of his estranged wife, who was trying
to find out about his live-in girlfriend.

   Palestinian guerrillas in speedboats
attacked the Israeli coast today, but Israeli forces killed four of
them and captured 12 before they could hurt thousands of people on
the beach or Tel Aviv hotels.
   A faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization claimed
responsibility for the raid, which apparently was aimed at the
hotels, which were crowded because of a religious holiday. No
Israelis were hurt.
   One of the six guerrilla speedboats came ashore only a few
hundred yards from a crowded Mediterranean beachclub in Nizzanim,
18 miles from Tel Aviv. The other five guerrilla boats were
intercepted before they reached land.
   Witnesses said the speedboat that reached land had 11 guerrillas
abaord and was headed north toward Tel Aviv when it was chased
ashore by an Israeli gunboat. The guerrillas were pinned down in
the sand dunes by heavy fire from elite army units and soldiers in
two U.S.-made Cobra helicopter gunships.
   Four guerrillas were killed, the army said.
   A second boat was intercepted en route to an undisclosed
location on the beachfront north of Tel Aviv.
   In Bagdad, Iraq, the PLO faction known as the Palestine
Liberation Front said it carried out an attack in retaliation for
the killing of Palestinian leader Abu Jihad in Tunisia two years
ago.
   Abu Jihad, a nom de guerre for Khalil al-Wazir, was killed by a
commando widely believed to be Israeli in Tunis, Tunisia, in April
1988.
   The faction is led by Abul al-Abbas, who has been convicted in
abstentia by an Italian court for masterminding the hijacking of
the Italian cruise liner Achille Lauro in 1985. One American was
killed during the hijacking.
   Hussein al-Abed, the faction's representative in Baghdad, said
the guerrillas today attacked ``selected and limited targets on the
Palestinian coast.'' It was unclear whether the attack had the
endorsement of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, who pledged in December
1988 to abandon terrorism.
   Al-Abed confirmed that four guerrillas were killed, but he
insisted that 11 others were still fighting.
   Most civilians were forced off the beaches south of Tel Aviv,
where they had come on the Shavuot holiday or Festival of Weeks,
which marks the giving of the Ten Commandments.
   In his comments on Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the armed forces chief
of staff, blamed the raid on al-Abbas' group. ``Abul al-Abbas was
responsible,'' Shomron said during a news conference in Tel Aviv.
``It was his decision to kill people in the most populated areas of
Israel.''
   The army said a guerrilla mothership from Beghazi, Libya,
released the six smaller craft 120 miles from the coast. It said
the raiders, who were armed with Katyusha rockets and other heavy
weapons, planned to kill civilians at hotels in Tel Aviv.
   The raid was the largest Palestinian infiltration attempt by sea
since March 11, 1978, when a dozen guerrillas from Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction came
ashore and hijacked a bus on the coastal highway north of Tel Aviv.
Thirty-three people were killed and 82 wounded in the incident.
   Today's attack was launched on the final day of an Arab summit
in Baghdad.
   During the summit, Arab leaders, including Arafat, verbally
attacked Israel. The leaders also called for political and economic
sanctions against nations that recognize Jerusalem as the capital
of Israel, and they denounced U.S. policies in the Middle East.
   After today's raid, police ordered the evacuation of thousands
of Israelis from a 30-mile stretch of beaches south of Tel Aviv.
They also told thousands of other residents near the beach to stay
home.
   ``It was well planned but as far as we know totally
unsuccessfully,'' said an army spokesman, who could not be
identified in keeping with army regulations.
   One guerrilla squad landed at midmorning on an empty stretch of
beach at Nizzanim, 18 miles south of Tel Aviv. About 3,000 Israeli
beachgoers were enjoying themselves at a packed club only a few
hundred yards away.
   Naval Rear Adm. Micha Ram said the second vessel was spotted
about 20 miles from Tel Aviv and told to stop by an Israeli
gunboat. ``They lifted their hands and were ordered to jump in the
water. Later, we fished them out,'' he said.
   Zvi Amitai, 57, a member of the Nizzanim Kibbutz communal farm,
said he was collecting driftwood when he saw the speedboat slicing
through the water followed by an Israeli patrol boat. He said a
spotter plane circled overhead, and there was gunfire.
   He said the guerrillas landed 20 yards away on a strip of beach
that was empty except for himself and a few fishermen.
   ``They jumped from the boat and didn't shoot, as if they didn't
see us,'' Amitai said. ``They just ran for the dunes.''
   An Israeli who was on the beach with his wife and children said
all the attackers had been killed or captured in little more than a
half hour. ``We heard some firing. ... I saw a boat coming in very
fast from the sea onto the beach,'' he said.
   ``Minutes after that, a couple of Israeli patrol boats came into
the area and started shooting in the direction where the boat had
landed,'' said the man who declined to give his name. ``The
firefight continued for about half an hour and then helicopters
flew in and started shooting in the same area.''
   Army radio said the mother ship from Libya had passed by Port
Said on the Suez Canal. It said Egyptian authorities had been
notified but did not elaborate.
   Though the attack appeared to have been planned in advance of
the Arab summit, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens linked the raid to
the strident rhetoric coming from the Arab leaders.

<HEAD>Pact Allowing U.S. Bases in Greece Initialed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Greece and the United States initialed a
new defense pact on Wednesday that will allow U.S. military bases
to remain on Greek soil for the next eight years.
   The agreement ended nearly a year of uncertainty over the fate
of the bases.
   The United States has four bases and about 20 smaller units
around the country but is closing two of the bases as part of a
worldwide cost-cutting drive.
   Sources who asked not to be identified said the new accord
allows for the two remaining U.S. bases to continue to operate in
Greece. They are a major naval installation at Souda and an Air
Force electronic surveillance station at Gournes. Both are on the
southern island of Crete.
   Government spokesman Vyron Polydoras told reporters the content
of the pact would be released in two weeks.
   ``The agreement will remain classified until submitted to the
appropriate services of the U.S. Defense and State Departments,''
Polydoras said.
   He confirmed that some operations of the Hellenikon Air Force
base near Athens, slated for closure by Washington, would be
transferred to Souda. The other base to close under the U.S. plan
is a naval communications station at Nea Makri northeast of Athens.
   The previous five-year agreement, covering defense and economic
ties between the countries, expired in December 1988.
   The new agreement's title makes no reference to economic ties
between the two countries.
   Polydoras refused to say whether Greece would receive financial
aid as part of the new agreement. Kiki Munshi, press attache of the
U.S. Embassy in Athens, also refused to give details of the pact.
   Premier Constantine Mitsotakis of the conservative New Democracy
Party was elected in April and pledged to reach an agreement with
the United States on the bases.
   Andreas Papandreou's socialist government, which lost power in
national elections in June 1989, had conducted 17 rounds of talks
with the United States but failed to arrive at an accord.
   Mitsotakis is a staunch supporter of defense ties with the
United States. He leaves for Washington on June 3 for talks with
President Bush.
   The Greek Parliament will have to ratify the accord before it
becomes law, with an absolute majority required in the 300-member
house.
   Mitsotakis has 150 seats in Parliament and the backing of one
deputy who represents a small conservative party. Political
analysts expect the bill to go through.
   The diplomats leading the negotiating teams initialed the accord
at the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. They are ambassadors Christos
Zacharakis of Greece and Alan Flanigan of the United States.
   The initialing followed two rounds of intensive talks in Athens
and one in Washington this month.

   Millicent Miller, who worked as Vivien
Leigh's stand-in during filming of ``Gone With the Wind,'' has
died. She was 81.
   Mrs. Miller died Tuesday. The cause of death wasn't given.
   She lived most of her life in Stillwater, except for nine years
she spent in California.
   In California, she joined the Screen Actors Guild and was asked
to interview for the job as Miss Leigh's stand-in for ``Gone With
the Wind.'' She was hired from a group of more than 300 applicants.
   She appeared in the movie as Scarlett O'Hara hiding under a
bridge while a wagon passes overhead. And it was her hand that
pulled a turnip from the ground after the ruination of Scarlett's
plantation Tara, and her hand that drew a revolver from a drawer
before Scarlett shoots a Union soldier.
   Mrs. Miller is survived by her husband, Jimmy ``Pete'' Miller, a
daughter and granddaughter.
   Services are scheduled for Thursday.

   The World Bank announced over $200 million
worth of loans on Wednesday to foster education and other social
goals in four west African countries.
   The bank, owned by 152 countries, is the largest source of aid
to the Third World.
   Most of the money, such as the $120 million to improve higher
education in Nigeria, will be repayable only after 35 years or more
at less than 1 percent interest a year.
   Ghana will get $50 million to improve primary and secondary
schools.
   Two loans worth $21.6 million will go to Gambia. One, for $14.6
million, is to raise the quality of education at all levels. The
other, for $7 million, includes training in reading and arithmetic
for 10,000 women in 125 villages.
   In Cameroon, the bank's loan will contribute $21.5 million to an
$86 million social project that includes school supplies and
vocational training. Canada, France, West Germany, Japan, the
United States and other international agencies are also
contributing to the project.

   Two jet trainers from the South Dakota Air
National Guard collided over Iowa this morning and crashed, a guard
spokesman said.
   The three crew members _ two from one A-7 trainer jet and one
from the other _ parachuted to safety, said Lt. Reid
Christopherson, executive officer of the South Dakota Air National
Guard.
   He would not release the names of the crew members, who were
brought to Spencer Municipal Hospital, where administrator Jim
Striepe said he could not give a condition report.
   Witnesses said the planes crashed on a farm two miles north of
Royal, which is about 8 miles southwest of Spencer. Christopherson
said the planes crashed at 10:30 a.m.
   John Schultz of Spencer said he was watching the planes in the
air when they collided.
   ``At first, it was like stunning, watching the flames,'' Schultz
said. ``Then, it really got disheartening because I figured there
was probably lives lost. Glad to hear they got out of there.''
   Christopherson said the planes were on a local training flight
out of Sioux Falls.
   ``They were flying around like they were chasing each other, dog
fighting like,'' Schultz said. ``I was sitting there watching. They
were looping around and banking around. It looked like they were
having a great time.''
   Schultz said he saw three planes, and one flew out of sight.
   ``I was watching the other two. They just collided,'' he said.
``They just hit head on. Each one exploded in a ball of fire, and
that was it. I didn't see the parachutes.''
   Dan Van Berkum of Spencer also was watching the planes maneuver.
   ``You could see a flash and explosion,'' Van Berkum said.
``After that explosion, you could see two jets definitely falling
to the ground. After a minute or so, you could see three
parachutes.''
   The A-7 fighters ``date back to the '60s,'' Christopherson said.
   He had no word on what kind of damage the planes did on the
ground. The area is mostly farm fields.

<HEAD>Hoarders Causing Food Shortages, Government Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germans are clearing store shelves and
filling their refrigerators because they fear massive price
increases when the nation converts to a free market, officials said
Wednesday.
   East Germans are making a run on canned goods, meat, soap, sugar
and ``everything that can be stored,'' said Commerce Ministry
spokeswoman Christian Boschek.
   Food distributors also are sitting on large stocks of meat and
other goods, creating shortages, apparently while waiting for the
July 2 economic merger with West Germany, the government said.
Unification of the German states' economies is expected to bring
higher prices and massive unemployment.
   Government spokesman Matthias Gehler said subsidies on food will
be scrapped July 2 and prices will be set by the free market,
rather than the state.
   But subsidies for utilities, rents and public transporation will
remain at least until Dec. 31, when the government will assess the
effects of capitalism on the country, Gehler said.
   ``We cannot have half a marriage. We want to enter into it
entirely,'' he said at a news conference.
   Prices of many products already are rising as West German goods
begin filling East German stores.
   Boschek said people she called ``hamster buyers'' were
purchasing as many goods as they can.
   Gehler said more than 100 inspectors will be sent around the
country to investigate reports that East German food distributors
and producers are intentionally keeping products off the market
until July 2. On that date they can be paid in convertible West
German marks.
   The centerpiece of the economic union is the conversion of East
German currency to West German marks.
   Under a treaty between the Germanys, most East Germans will be
able to convert up to $2,400 to West German marks at a 1-1 rate.
Amounts above that will be converted at a 2-1 rate.
   Salaries and pensions also will be converted at a 1-1 rate.
   The government will begin passing out applications next week to
East Germans for converting their cash.
   East Germans now have 440 billion marks in savings accounts,
said Wolfrid Stoll, vice president of the East German Staatsbank.
That includes 25 million accounts held by 16 million East Germans
and hundreds of thousands held by enterprises, legal entities and
foreigners.
   Stoll said banks would stay open longer and personnel would be
reinforced to handle the expected crunch. He urged East Germans to
remain ``calm and level-headed'' when the droves of people begin
descending on East German banks.
   He said East Germans are expected to open between 1.5 million
and 2 million new accounts in June alone in anticipation of the
economic union. East Germans must have their money in bank accounts
to convert their currency.
   The government will begin passing out West German currency to
stores in the days before the economic union is official. East
Germans will be able to buy products in East German marks and get
their change back in West marks at a 2-1 exchange rate.

   A strong earthquake struck Romania
today, killing eight people, injuring 260 and heavily damaging
buildings in Bucharest and other cities across much of the country,
police said.
   The temblor was felt in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Greece,
Turkey and Bulgaria, but of those only the Soviet Union reported
casualties.
   Six people were reported injured and buildings were damaged in
the Soviet republic of Moldavia near the Romanian border. A Soviet
lawmaker said initial reports from the region indicated there were
an unspecified number of deaths.
   In Romania, some people were killed or injured by large chunks
of concrete and plaster that fell from buildings onto sidewalks and
streets. Several people in Bucharest were hurt when they jumped
from windows or balconies.
   Thousands of frightened residents in the capital city of 2.2
million people fled into streets as buildings swayed and cracked.
   Romania's General Inspectorate of Police said two people died in
Bucharest, two in the Danube River port of Braila, and one each in
the cities of Buzau and Brasov, and in the Ialomita and Prahova
counties, north of the capital.
   The inspectorate reported 260 people injured, 45 critically. It
said 35 of the critically injured were in Bucharest, where 138
people were hurt.
   Elsewhere, it said, 51 people were injured in Braila, 21 in Dolj
in the southwest, 20 in Prahova, 12 in Ialomita, 10 in the eastern
county of Galati, 7 in the nearby county of Constanta bordering on
the Black Sea, and one in Buzau.
   An earlier erroneous police report said 42 were injured in
Brasov.
   In Calarasi County in southern Romania, the ceiling of a major
electrical steel plant crashed to the floor, the state news agency
Rompres reported.
   In Golden, Colo. the U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake
measured 6.5 on Richter scale. Its epicenter was 100 miles north of
Bucharest, in the wooded Vrancea range of the Carpathian mountains.
   The earthquake struck at 1:40 p.m. (6:40 a.m. EDT) and rumbled
across the Carpathians, which run through eastern Romania, the
western border of the Soviet Union and southwest Poland.
   In Bulgaria, the state BTA news agency said the temblor was felt
nationwide but there was minor damage only in Silistra, a town on
the border with Romania. A nuclear power plant in Kozlodoui on the
Danube river was closed.
   In the Soviet Union, the quake knocked out telephone lines and
shook buildings in at least three of the country's 15 republics:
Russia, the Ukraine and Moldavia.
   In Ottawa, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said when asked
about the earthquake: ``Everything is OK. There was no devastation,
no destruction.''
   Six people were hospitalized in Kogul, near the Soviet Union's
border with Romania, said Lt. Ivan Koltuk of the regional Interior
Department.
   ``The quake was really strong. Everything and everybody was
falling,'' said Alexander Yevchenko, a local official. Buildings
were damaged in Izmail, Bolgrad, Reni, Kogul and Komrat, Soviet
officials said.
   The quake also shook buildings in Moscow, 1,000 miles east of
Bucharest, and was felt as far north as Leningrad. U.S. officials
closed the older U.S. Embassy, which is 10 stories tall.
   ``It's an old building, and when the upper floors shook we
called around other places in town and closed the building as
precaution to do safety checks,'' said embassy spokesman Jim
Bullock.
   One of the two people killed in Bucharest, shop assistant
Petruta Lungu, died when she was hit by a collapsing balcony as she
ran outside after the quake struck, police said.
   The Fire Department said two small fires were reported in
Bucharest, one in an apartment and another in the chemical
laboratory of a high school.
   Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert of Glasgow, Scotland, staying in an
apartment in a 10-story building in Bucharest, said: ``The walls of
the bedroom crumbled with plaster falling. Stuff came flying off
shelves and all the plaster came off the ceilings. Outside there's
a massive crack in the building.''
   Elena Chibzui, 56, who was in her sixth-floor apartment in
central Bucharest, said: ``I'm very scared, and I could hear shouts
in the neighboring apartment.'' Her building suffered only a minor
crack.
   Doina Stoica, a 22-year-old student, said: ``I was scared. I was
in a book shop and the first thought was to get my mom and get out
on the street.''
   Michel Desprats, 24, a French journalist at the Bucuresti Hotel,
noticed the chandeliers in the marble lobby swinging. ``In panic, I
followed all the people out of the hotel and people were all
shouting and crying,'' he said.
   Inside the hotel, which suffered structural cracks on almost
every floor, small chunks of plaster littered the carpet.
   In Vienna, the Austrian Seismological Institute said the
epicenter of the quake appeared to be located in Romania's Vrancea
range of the Carpathians.
   This was the third major earthquake in Romania since 1977. The
other two were also centered in the Vrancea range and the most
serious, on March 4, 1977, killed 1,500 people.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by a
quake as measures by the ground motion recorded by seismographs.
   Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in
magnitude.
   A powerful earthquake struck Soviet Armenia in December 1988,
killing an estimated 25,000 people and leveling buildings in
several villages and cities.
   An earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale struck the San
Francisco Bay area Oct. 17, 1989, killing 67 people and injuring
more than 3,000 others.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors asked today for dismissal of
drug possession, explosives and sexual assault charges against
Hunter Thompson, saying their case against the ``gonzo'' journalist
was not strong enough.
   The dismissal motions, to heard Thursday in Pitkin County
District Court, said potential witnesses had not cooperated with
district attorney's office investigators.
   A statement by the district attorney's office also said a
preliminary hearing May 22 resulted in discrepancies between sworn
testimony and previous statements to investigators.
   Thompson said in an interview that the decision was ``a huge
victory for all of us'' and there would be a ``celebratory orgy''
tonight at his favorite hangout, the Woody Creek Tavern in Aspen.
   Thompson, 53, last week was ordered to stand trial June 25 on
four felony and three misdemeanor charges after the preliminary
hearing before Judge Charles Buss, who threw out a felony charge of
using cocaine.
   The charges stemmed from a visit to Thompson's home in Woody
Creek last February by Gale Palmer-Slater of Port Huron, Mich., an
entrepreneur and ex-pornographic film actress and producer. She
claimed that Thompson grabbed her breast and threw a drink at her
and that she saw him sniff cocaine during her hours-long visit to
his home.
   Authorities subsequently searched Thompson's home and said they
found LSD, cocaine, tranquilizers, marijuana and explosives.
Thompson claimed the drugs had been left by guests over the years
and were only turned up because his home was searched with a
thoroughness inappropriate for a misdemeanor assault charge.
   Thompson is an author and journalist known for his accounts of
political campaigns, shark hunts in Hawaii and the Hell's Angels.
He often has laced his exaggerated first-person reports with
accounts of his own drug and alcohol abuse.

   Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a not-quite-yet announced
candidate for re-election, joked to reporters that Davey Johnson's
firing as manager of the New York Mets could be a portent.
   ``What it means is incumbents are in trouble,'' Cuomo said
Wednesday.
   Cuomo was in Manhattan to sign an agreement that freezes
Consolidated Edison electric rates for two years. He called it
important news for consumers and business people.
   While mentioning a long list of people responsible for
negotiating the rate freeze, the two-term Democratic governor
added, ``I'll take all the credit I can, especially this year.''
   Cuomo has said he will make an announcement soon about his
future and that it would contain no surprises.
   The election is in November.
   Johnson was fired Tuesday after more than six seasons as Mets
manager.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today paid
his respects to Canada's war dead and prepared to head for
Washington, expressing confidence that he and President Bush will
agree on a way to permit German unification.
   But Gorbachev reaffirmed his country's opposition to a united
Germany belonging to NATO.
   ``I haven't yet heard any alternative from the West,'' he said
after meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. ``It seems that
it is just like an old record that seems to be playing the same
note again and again. ... I would like us to find a new melody.''
   Gorbachev planned to fly to Washington this afternoon for four
days of talks with Bush. They are expected to focus on German
unification, arms reduction and trade.
   Asked Tuesday if he was optimistic about reaching agreement over
Germany and its membership in NATO, Gorbachev replied: ``I am sure
of that. And tell that to the American people.''
   Gorbachev has warned that U.S. insistence on NATO membership for
a united Germany could stall the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet Union has moved progressively from outright
opposition to German reunification to acceptance of the concept
under some formula that would provide assurances a new German giant
would never again pose a military threat to its neighbors.
   Gorbachev met Mulroney at the War Memorial and laid a wreath
honoring Canadian soldiers. After playing of the national anthems,
there was a moment of silence, then a lament played by a lone piper.
   Gorbachev then surprised everyone by walking part of the short
distance to Parliament Hill for his second round of talks with
Mulroney.
   Gorbachev and Mulroney strolled slowly toward the ornate gray
stone Parliament building, smiling and occasionally speaking to
people in the crowd. They then got in their cars to drive the final
stretch.
   It was the second time since his arrival that Gorbachev mingled
with Canadians on the street. Tuesday night, he spent nearly an
hour amiably chatting, answering questions and shaking hands with a
crowd on a pedestrian mall.
   Outside Parliament today, hundreds of protesters chanted, waved
flags and carried placards appealing for independence for the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which were
forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Later, in a toast at a luncheon, Mulroney lamented the lot of
leaders who attempt reform _ a problem faced by both himself and
Gorbachev.
   ``Leadership in the service of reform is no guarantee of
political popularity,'' Mulroney complained, obviously referring to
Gorbachev's difficulties in implementing economic and political
reform and Mulroney's own problems involving French-speaking Quebec
and disgruntlement over new taxes.
   Gorbachev also talked about change and the ``breakdown of
established views and stereotypes.''
   ``Today, at a watershed in world history and politics, the
friendly feelings and creatiave aspirations of our two peoples can
serve as the northern pillar of the bridge of confidence and
security between the East and the West,'' he said.
   At Parliament Hill, Gorbachev was asked by a reporter about the
powerful earthquake that struck Romania and the Soviet Union today.
   ``I've been told there were several shocks in Moldavia and
Armenia which were ... even felt in Moscow,'' Gorbachev said. ``But
everything is OK. There was no devastation, no destruction.''
   Gorbachev said he saw no reason to break off his trip and return
home.
   After the U.S.-Soviet summit ends Sunday, he plans to leave for
Minneapolis, followed by a trip to San Francisco, where he will
meet with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, U.S. officials said
today.
   The two countries have no formal diplomatic relations and the
Soviets maintain strong ties with Communist North Korea, which
conducted a brief and now-suspended dialogue with the pro-U.S.
government in Seoul.
   Gorbachev left worsening domestic troubles at home _ including
panic-buying and clashes between troops and militants in Armenia _
as he flew to Canada for an overnight visit before going to his
second summit meeting with Bush.
   On the sidelines, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and Joe Clark, Canada's minister for external affairs, held two
meetings on a number of international and bilateral issues.
   The future of a new, united Germany and a changing role for the
North Atlantic alliance figure to be among the more sticky issues
during the visit to the United States. Clark said the two subjects
were high on the agenda in meetings between Soviet and Canadian
officials.
   Shevardnadze said he and Clark were in general agreement on
Canada's desire for an increased role for the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, but there were differences
on Germany and its membership in NATO.
   Clark said both Canada and the Soviet Union would work toward a
summit of the CSCE nations _ the United States, Canada, and all
European nations except Albania _ which met for the first time in
Helsinki, Finland, in 1975.
   Meanwhile, Canada announced it will extend a $500 million line
of credit, or about $425 million in U.S. dollars, to the Soviet
Union for the purchase of Canadian goods and services over the next
two years. In the past, Canada has extended $360 million to the
Soviets.

   The name of his hometown is nothing to smile
about for Chuck Raines.
   He's tired of all the jokes, and has begun a lobbying effort
aimed at getting town leaders to rename the tiny Jackson County
town near the Ohio line.
   ``When the community was first named, the word gay meant merry,
joyous and lively,'' Raines said. ``But as times have changed so
has the meaning of the word.''
   Last week, Raines petitioned the Jackson County Commission,
which would have to approve any name change. Raines hasn't
suggested a new name, he just knows he hates ``Gay.''
   The commission has not acted yet, but Raines is already facing

   Ruth Skinner, the town's postmaster for the past 32 years, said
the town got its name in the 1850s. The way she sees it, Gay was
Gay before gay was homosexual.
   ``I'm satisfied with the way things are. This place was named
Gay a long time before this other stuff got started.''

<HEAD>Tickets To See Gorbachev Are Hard To Get</HEAD>

   Friends World College was celebrating the news
that Mikhail S. Gorbachev would accept its peace award _ then the
Soviets said the school could bring only 12 people to the embassy
ceremony.
   Tickets to other summit events aren't quite that scarce. But
anyone hoping to make this week's social scene needs good friends
in the right places. It doesn't hurt to be rich or famous, either.
   From a series of short awards ceremonies at the Soviet Embassy
to the full-fledged state dinner Thursday night at the White House,
guest lists have a familiar ring. As in Eisenhower, Roosevelt,
Hearst, Cronkite, Kennedy, Fulbright, Galbraith and Schlesinger.
   Gorbachev agreed several months ago to accept the Martin Luther
King Jr. Peace Award from Friends World College, a tiny Quaker
school which requires its 550 students to live in two foreign
countries and learn two foreign languages in order to graduate.
   The Huntington, L.I. college was euphoric. So were many others,
and they all wanted to attend the ceremony. The demand from ``major
political people and major corporate people'' was tremendous, said
college president Lawrence Weiss.
   Among the prospective guests are New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias (himself a former winner
of the award) and a passle of New York politicians from Congress
and the state legislature.
   By Tuesday Weiss had persuaded the Soviets to give him 20 slots.
He was agitating for 50 on Wednesday. ``It's a historical event,''
he said. ``A lot of Americans are very attracted to Gorbachev and
would like to see him in person and shake his hand and be
photographed doing that.''
   The hottest events are the state dinner featuring opera singer
Frederica von Stade and a dinner Friday night at the Soviet
Embassy. President Bush compiled the list for the White House
event, based on suggestions from friends, aides and the State
Department.
   Invitations to about 130 prospective guests were mailed 10 days
ago. And while Bush aides won't discuss turndowns, at least one
prominent Washingtonian had to send his regrets to both the White
House and embassy dinners.
   Mstislav Rostropovich, a Soviet emigre who is music director of
the National Symphony Orchestra, will be conducting both nights at
the Kennedy Center and can't go to either event, said spokeswoman
Tiki Davies.
   Arthur Hartman, a former ambassador to the Soviet Union, isn't
going to any events, either. His daughter is getting married. ``We
have a wedding this week, and we chose the date before they did,''
he said.
   Other coveted invitations include those for an ``intellectuals''
luncheon Thursday at the Soviet Embassy and a reception later that
day at the Library of Congress, where Raisa Gorbachev will open an
exhibit of ancient Soviet books, documents and manuscripts.
   Pamela Harriman, the millionaire Democratic fund-raiser, will be
at both.
   Of course, she and Raisa go way back. Mrs. Gorbachev had tea
with Harriman during the 1987 summit in Washington, and Harriman
met with her for more than two hours earlier this month in Moscow.
   The 200 people who received courier-borne invitations last week
to the Library of Congress event were selected by librarian James
Billington and industrialist Armand Hammer. Many of them qualify as
household names _ Supreme Court justices, Cabinet members,
presidential relatives _ and many who don't are prominent in the
corporate realm.

   A powerful earthquake jolted Peru's
northeastern jungle, killing at least 67 people, injuring hundreds
and wrecking dozens of homes, Civil Defense authorities said today.
   Thirty five of the deaths Tuesday night occurred in Moyobamba, a
town of 50,000 people 400 miles north of Lima, officials said. The
other dead were from villages in nearby jungle areas, they said.
   The quake, measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale, occurred at 9:33
p.m. (10:33 p.m. EDT) Tuesday, according to the Peruvian
Geophysical Institute.
   The epicenter was in the jungle 75 miles northeast of Moyobamba,
it said.
   Many houses and buildings in Moyobamba were destroyed, including
a downtown church, according to Gen. Jorge Ferreyro, Peru's Civil
Defense chief.
   Electricity and telephone lines were completely cut in the
region, Ferreyro said.
   Moyobamba has few doctors, and authorities there asked the
government to send in medical staff, medicine and generators to
help tend to the hundreds of injuired. Health Minister Paul Caro
Gamarra said an air force plane was to leave for Moyobamba carrying
doctors and emergency supplies.
   Health department workers have been on a nationwide strike for
two months, but a union official in Lima said today workers were
helping with emergency plans.
   The institute said the area suffered at least 20 aftershocks,
including one shortly after midnight that registered 4.7 on the
Richter scale.
   The temblor came two days before the 20th anniversary of a
devastating earthquake that killed 70,000 people in northern Andes
Mountains. That quake registered 7.7 on the Richter scale. An
estimated 20,000 people in Yungay were buried in mud and ice that
came crashing down from a nearby mountain.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude of 5 can cause considerable
damage.

<HEAD>World War II Veteran Haunted by Memories Takes Life on Memorial

   A veteran of the World War II invasion
of Normandy, haunted by the memories of seeing his friends killed
in battle, committed suicide on Memorial Day.
   ``He was never able to recover from the shock of being in
hand-to-hand combat and seeing friends killed before his eyes,''
Wayne Mathews said of his father, James Arnold Mathews.
   The elder Mathers, 65, shot himself in the head at his suburban
Hoover home, Wayne Mathews said Tuesday.
   Wayne Mathews said his father had seen psychiatrists for years
for treatment of depression. ``It was helping him when he was
involved with it, but it didn't stick.''
   His father was 18 when he went to fight German forces in France
as a tank gunner. The invasion of Normandy began on June 6, 1944,
D-Day, and Mathews went in as part of the Army's second wave a day
later.
   During a battle in Belgium, the gun on Mathews' tank jammed and
he climbed out under heavy fire to clear it with a ramrod. An
officer saw his heroism and helped him get the Bronze Star.
   In the same battle, the tank next to his was blown up, killing
his best friend. Before the war ended, most of his other friends
fell.
   After the war, he built a successful home improvement company
and raised four children, but friends said the man who appeared to
be a witty charmer could never shake his vivid memories of the war.
   ``He was not wiped out instantaneously in combat, but I really
think the scars he sustained in a combat situation did claim him.
It just took it a long time. I would say the war probably invaded
his life every day,'' said Chris Doss, a Samford University law
professor.
   Mathews' funeral was scheduled for Thursday at Elmwood Chapel in
Birmingham.

<TEXT>
   A bill sponsored by former Ku Klux Klan
leader David Duke to ban affirmative action easily passed the
Louisiana House, enraging blacks who called it unconstitutional and
a racist political ploy.
   The bill was designed to help Duke's campaign for the U.S.
Senate, state Sen. William Jefferson charged at Wednesday news
conference by the 20-member Black Legislative Caucus.
   ``It is simply a bill to advance the causes of Mr. David Duke.
That's it. We're not going to just play a game that involves David
Duke's electoral politics,'' said Jefferson.
   Duke is running as a Republican for the Senate seat now held by
Democrat J. Bennett Johnston. The state GOP leadership, however,
has endorsed another Republican, state Sen. Ben Bagert.
   While Duke basked in Tuesday's 65-36 victory, he acknowledged
his bill would have problems ``in the liberal Senate.''
   ``The Senate, being the kind of body it is, won't pass it,''
predicted Jefferson, a power in the upper chamber.
   State Rep. C.D. Jones, a black caucus member, told reporters
Louisiana' 1.3 million blacks should be concerned only with the
intent of the bill, drafted by a former Klan grand wizard whose
legislative office once sold pro-Nazi books.
   ``The bill is in conflict with federal law and therefore is
nothing in and of itself,'' said Jones. ``The issue here is the
intent of the bill to divide races, the racist intent to set poor
people and blacks back 25 years.
   ``The House vote sends a signal to the nation that it's all
right to be racist, all right to be a former member of the Ku Klux
Klan, that you can draw on that experience to be a member of this
body. It sends a signal to corporate America that Louisiana is a
place where racism is alive and well.''
   Gov. Buddy Roemer said he would veto the bill if it got to his
desk, but didn't expect it to clear the Senate.
   Duke said all his bill does ``is prohibit discrimination.''
   ``For blacks to call this a racist bill is hypocrisy,'' he said.
``Those who voted with me endorsed the principle that people should
be judged on individual merits, abilities and talents _ not on
their race.''
   Affirmative action programs are geared to help minorities
overcome past discrimination, said Jones. ``Lyndon Johnson, when
the Civil Rights Act was passed 25 years ago, said you cannot take
people who for years have been shackled, remove the shackles, put
them in a race and tell them they can now compete with everybody
else evenly.''
   Asked how long affirmative action programs would be needed,
Jones said, ``until racism ends.''
   Jefferson said he didn't believe racism is widespread in the
Legislature. He said he understood the affirmative action vote
might have been revenge for black defections earlier in the day on
a vote to establish a state lottery.
   Lottery proponents blamed its defeat on three blacks, longtime
supporters who didn't vote for the measure because they didn't like
certain amendments to the bill.
   ``I don't think it's a good trade to get upset about a lottery
vote and then vote the other way on a basic human rights issue,''
Jefferson said.
   Duke's affirmative action bill got only 36 votes last year but
many of those who voted against him in 1989 backed his latest
measure.
   ``I think maybe the lottery affected one or two votes,'' Duke
said. ``But, I had the votes to pass it, lottery or not.''
   Roemer said he hopes the rest of America doesn't judge Louisiana
on the basis of the House vote.
   ``I have trouble with the author. He sends all kinds of wrong
signals,'' Roemer said. ``The signal is not what the author says
but that the state is open to everyone, black and white and from
whatever part of the world they come.
   ``Watch our actions, and not the words of one legislator or even
one vote in the House. A lot of those votes have complex feelings
behind them, including feelings of the failure of old affirmative
action programs. We have new programs.''

   New home sales plummeted in April to their
lowest level since the nation's economy emerged from the 1981-82
recession, the government said Wednesday.
   Analysts attributed the fifth consecutive decline to continued
double-digit mortgage rates.
   The Commerce Department reported that new home sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546,000 units in April, the
smallest number since 521,000 units were sold in December 1982.
   ``We're seeing the worst of it right now,'' said economist Mark
M. Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``In
April and early May, mortgage rates were at their highest levels
and have come back down since then.''
   According to national surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., recent mortgage rates peaked at 10.67 percent during the
first week in May and had fallen to 10.33 percent by last Friday.
   The rates ranged between 10.25 percent and 10.56 percent in
April.
   Thomas Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said the recent decline may help sales in the
near-term but that rates would track in the range of 10.25 percent
to 10.5 percent for the rest of the year.
   On the other hand, John A. Tuccillo, chief economist with the
National Association of Realtors, said ``we expect mortgage rates
to trend downward in the summer, which should spur sales of new
homes and existing homes.''
   Tuccillo said rates also have cut into sales of existing homes,
which also slipped in April, down 2.1 percent. It was their third
drop in four months, although sales were unchanged in March.
   David Seiders, chief economist with the National Association of
Home Builders, said in addition to high rates, the general economic
sluggishness is having an adverse affect on sales.
   ``Income growth and employment growth are clearly weak,'' he
said.
   As a result of the weak sales, inventories of new homes rose to
their highest level since July 1982 _ a 8.1-month backlog at the
April sales pace, compared with 8.2 months during the last
recession.
   Both median and average prices for new homes set records in
April, but analysts generally agreed that reflected sales gains in
the expensive Northeastern market _ the only region posting
increased purchases.
   The median price jumped 13.8 percent, to $135,900, while the
average price increased 11.2 percent, to $160,200. The median price
means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   New home sales in the Northeast gained 18 percent, to 105,000
units, after a 34.8 percent gain in March.
   Few economists believe the pace can be sustained, however.
   ``There's no reason for a rebound in the Northeast,'' Seiders
said. ``Interest rates are the same everywhere and employment is
weak there. I don't expect any continuation of the percentage
increases we saw in March and April.''
   Sales were down 6.4 percent in the West, to 146,000 units; down
6 percent in the South, to 203,000 units; and down 2.1 percent in
the Midwest, to 92,000 units.
   For the first four months of 1990, sales have fallen 6.8
percent, to 206,000 units.

   Railroad crews pumped jet and diesel
fuel off beaver ponds today after draining 10 of the derailed
tanker cars that spewed 120,000 gallons into an area with wildlife
and newly spawned fish.
   Using suction machines, they had siphoned about one-tenth of the
spill by morning, said Chuck Kleeschulte, a spokesman for the state
Department of Environmental Conservation.
   ``They should be pumping fairly furiously this morning and this
afternoon to get the product off the surfaces of the two ponds,''
he said.
   ``The biggest concern right now is going to be with our
waterborne fur-bearers _ beavers, muskrat, otters,'' said Mac
McLean, a habitat biologist with the state Department of Fish and
Game.
   He said oil had been carried at least eight miles by Goldstream
Creek, and officials were concerned about Northern pike and
whitefish that had just finished spawning.
   ``The eggs could hatch any time, and that's a pretty sensitive
life stage,'' McLean said.
   The refined fuel is more toxic than crude oil, but also
dissipates faster, officials said.
   The jet and diesel fuel spilled after an Alaska Railroad freight
train derailed Monday 40 miles south of Fairbanks. Seven cars, each
holding 20,000 gallons, ripped open, spilling fuel into beaver
ponds on both sides of the track.
   Despite efforts to dam it, one pond was draining fuel into the
creek and the 500,000-acre Minto Flats Wildlife Refuge downstream,
said Pete McGee, a regional supervisor for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   More fuel probably would have run into the creek if not for the
beaver dams, said Al Townsend, a biologist for the state Department
of Fish and Game.
   Environmental officials had no immediate estimate of the threat
to wildlife in the boggy, conifer-covered area, a prime nesting
area for waterfowl. But when asked about the effect on the beavers,
Townsend drew a finger across his throat.
   The cause of the derailment wasn't immediately known.
   The train, with a crew of three, was going about 40 mph,
carrying fuel to Anchorage from the Mapco Alaska Petroleum Inc.
refinery in the town of North Police, said railroad spokeswoman
Vivian Hamilton. No one was injured in the accident.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives tonight for
summit talks with President Bush that will focus on tough arms
control and trade differences and search for common ground on the
future of a unified Germany.
   The White House said Bush was in a mood of ``anticipation and
confidence'' as Gorbachev wound up a brief visit to Canada and
headed for his second summit with Bush and his first in Washington
since he conferred with President Reagan in 1987.
   ``The president sees a new horizon in this meeting _ a horizon
of opportunity,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
``After their discussions we should have a much better view of a
new day in East-West relations.''
   The Soviet president, in terms harsher than comments made the
previous day, reaffirmed his country's opposition to a united
Germany belonging to NATO.
   ``I haven't yet heard any alternative from the West,'' Gorbachev
said after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
``It seems that it is just like an old record that seems to be
playing the same note again and again. ... I would like us to find
a new melody.''
   Bush was spending his second consecutive day closeted with
advisers over strategy for three days of summit talks starting
Thursday. He also spoke by telephone this morning with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Tuesday night with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Fitzwater said in a statement that Bush brings to the summit
talk ``the understandings and insights of many allied leaders,''
including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and French
President Francois Mitterrand, with whom he met recently.
   Bush was not prepared to offer a position for future
negotiations on the size of a unified German military _ a major
concern of the Soviets _ Fitzwater said.
   The White House press secretary disputed news accounts
suggesting Bush would offer assurances on limiting German forces to
bolster Gorbachev's standing at home.
   On prospects for a trade agreement during the summit, Fitzwater
said, ``I intentionally want to be vague.'' He added, ``I urge you
not to rule out anything.''
   ``This is an issue that really will depend on Gorbachev and
Bush,'' he said. The Bush administration has held up the trade
agreement to protest the Soviet Union's economic sanctions against
Lithuania and Soviet failure to enact liberal emigration
legislation.
   In a move to resolve disputed arms control issues, Col. Gen.
Labronislav Omelichev, first deputy on the Soviet defense
ministry's general staff, headed for Washington to enter talks on
possible nuclear and conventional fores agreements for Bush and
Gorbachev to announce.
   On the question of German troop levels, the United States still
maintains such discussions should be held as part of future talks
on reducing conventional forces in all of Europe, Fitzwater said.
   ``We are opposed to any proposal which would single out Germany
for special limits,'' he said.
   However, Fitzwater said the summit would include ``discussions
on the general question. We want to hear their concerns and their
interests. We'll express our policy.''
   ``This is not an issue which is linked in any way to German
unity nor to the renunciation of four-power rights,'' Fitzwater
said, referring to control of Germany's destiny by World War II
victors Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``President Bush will be exploring the subject with President
Gorbachev from the standpoint of exploring mutually acceptable
options and positions. Again, these issues are not going to be
decided here,'' he said.
   However, an administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Bush hopes to nudge Gorbachev into accelerating the
first round of conventional arms talks under way in Vienna,
Austria, so a treaty can be completed by year's end.
   Bush was described as firmly opposed to a Soviet proposal that a
united Germany be excluded from NATO's military structure while
remaining within its political framework.
   Gorbachev was upbeat about the German issue as he spoke to
reporters Tuesday outside Mulroney's residence in Ottawa. Gorbachev
said he was confident that he and Bush will find a way to preserve
the balance of power in Europe after East and West Germany are
unified.
   Asked if he was optimistic about agreement on Germany and its
membership in NATO, the Soviet leader replied: ``I am sure of that.
And tell that to the American people.''
   U.S. officials disclosed that Gorbachev would meet with South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo in San Francisco after the Washington
summit ends with a Bush-Gorbachev news conference on Sunday. The
Soviet leader's plan to meet Roh was viewed as a further warming in
relations between the two countries, which recently established
``consular departments'' in trade offices in each other's capitals.
   Before flying to Washington, Gorbachev acknowledged the
emergence of a new domestic worry _ the election of political
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin as president of the Russian republic _ as
a major earthquake struck Eastern Europe.
   Gorbachev told reporters that ``everything is OK'' in the Soviet
Union despite the quake that struck Romania this morning, killing
eight people, injuring 260 and causing widespread damage. Tremors
were felt in Moscow and Leningrad and a Soviet lawmaker said
initial reports from the republic of Moldavia indicated there were
an unspecified number of deaths.
   The Soviet leader said he saw no reason to break off his trip
and return home. A major earthquake in Soviet Armenia in December
1988 forced Gorbachev to cut short a visit to the United Nations in
New York, where he also met with President Reagan.
   In advance of the Soviet leader's early evening arrival, it was
announced that Vice President Dan Quayle will meet Gorbachev
briefly on Friday at the Soviet Embassy to discuss cooperation on
space exploration.
   Arms control negotiators for the two countries, meanwhile,
wrangled for more than two hours Tuesday over U.S. and Soviet
conventional forces in Europe as well as their nuclear arsenals,
including bombers and submarines.
   Meeting in secrecy at the State Department, they made some
progress toward reductions in both areas. They agreed, for example,
on definitions for such conventional weapons as tanks and armored
personnel carriers, which will make it easier to verify that treaty
terms are carried out, an official told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
   Although Secretary of State James A. Baker III's recent trip to
Moscow led to agreement on sea and air-launched missiles, a handful
of tough strategic weapons issues remained unsettled.
   Arms control issues still in dispute include whether to ban
ballistic missiles with multiple warheads and the number of flight
tests the Soviets could conduct of their heavy SS-18 missiles. The
arsenal of such missiles is to be halved, from 308 to 154, but
there is no agreement restricting improvement in the missiles that
remain.
   Bush and Gorbachev still are expected to issue a joint
declaration of progress toward a major reduction in nuclear
arsenals, officials said, but they cautioned that long-range
nuclear weapon issues still disputed may be excluded from that
declaration.
   On the economic front, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said Tuesday that a new commercial air travel agreement
has been initialed. Officials said it will be ready for signing at
the summit.

   Democrats narrowed the competition for their
1992 convention site to New Orleans and New York on Wednesday and
party chairman Ronald H. Brown said the final choice remained
``wide open.''
   After receiving the dual recommendation from the party's
site-selection committee, Brown said he would visit both cities and
that he anticipated ``tough negotiations'' before making his
decision in mid-June.
   The Democratic chairman is on track to settle on the convention
city at the earliest date in recent memory, hoping to ``get behind
us housekeeping details.'' The Democratic convention is scheduled
to run from July 16 through July 19, 1992.
   The Republicans have just begun their selection process and are
expected to complete it next January.
   In New York, Mayor David Dinkins said, ``We will redouble our
efforts from this point on to host the convention because no one
can do it better than New York City.''
   ``We're very pleased at this news of course,'' he said. ``Should
we lose to New Orleans we will all go forth and support New Orleans
as we anticipate New Orleans would support us.''
   Brown and other party officials were determinedly positive in
their assessments of the four cities that bid for the convention.
The chairman dismissed speculation he was concerned about the
potential for embarrassing demonstrations in either New Orleans or
New York.
   ``I am not one of those that believes the site of the convention
sends a major political message,'' said Brown.
   The two losers at this stage in the competition were Houston and
Cleveland.
   Members of the selection committee went out of their way to
praise Cleveland's bid.
   ``I would not be surprised to find us in Cleveland in 1996 as we
renominate our Democratic president,'' said Anne Campbell.
   In Cleveland, Mayor Michael R. White said the city's effort
would be useful in preparing a bid for the 1996 Democratic
convention and the 1992 Republican National Convention.
   ``There's nothing to be ashamed of here,'' White said at a news
conference.
   Houston was not considered a serious contender because of its
inability to guarantee the Democrats the long-term access they
required to the hall, in that case the Astrodome, where the Houston
Astros baseball team plays its home games.
   New Orleans, the site of the 1988 Republican National
Convention, has the Superdome, a huge stadium that could easily
accommodate the 5,500 delegates and alternates and additional
thousands of spectators.
   Madison Square Garden in New York presents size problems but
city officials have assured the Democrats they can make adjustments
to provide for additional seating.
   Asked about the difference in the halls, Brown said, ``I don't
know that that is going to be a major factor in the decision.''
   Supporters of New Orleans argued that the Louisiana city would
prove far more affordable than New York for most delegates. Brown
insisted that New York, where he grew up, also has an abundance of
affordable hotels and restaurants.
   Of far greater concern to many party officials was the potential
for street demonstrations. Racial tensions have been extremely high
in New York in recent weeks, while New Orleans is in an area
considered a stronghold of the anti-abortion movement.
   Once again, Brown dismissed suggestions that negative factors
would weigh heavily in his decision.
   ``We are the party of choice (on abortion),'' he said. ``It is
not where the convention is held, but what is said from the
podium,'' he added.

<HEAD>Zoo Keeper Recovering After Mauling by Leopard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A zoo keeper who screamed ``help me! help
me!'' after a 70-pound Persian leopard bit his neck was up and
about Wednesday, a day after the attack, a hospital spokeswoman
said.
   Alan Feinberg, 41, was in fair condition at San Francisco
General Hospital, where doctors stitched up his wounds, said the
spokeswoman, Gloria Rodriquez.
   It was the second attack by an animal at the zoo this year.
   Zoo officials were investigating why the female leopard, named
Fatima, attacked Feinberg, a zoo keeper for 18 years. Zoo director
David Anderson said the 14-year-old leopard may have attacked as
the keeper reached into the cage for a bone.
   Feinberg was standing in the keeper's area of the cage when the
attack occurred. He had apparently opened the gate that separates
the keeper's area from the exhibit area, Anderson said, making it
possible for the animal to attack. The gate to the exhibit area is
supposed to remain closed.
   ``Keepers are never supposed to be in there,'' he said. ``Maybe
he thought the animals weren't in there.''
   The mauling took place as a group of schoolchildren watched.
   ``The leopard had him by the neck and wouldn't let go until the
other keeper came and poked him,'' said Berry Accius, 15, of San
Rafael.
   ``I thought the leopard was going to kill him,'' said Othon
Franco, also 15 and from San Rafael. ``He was screaming, `Help me!
Help me! Get him off! Get him off!'''
   Senior zoo keeper Tony Colonese, alerted by a visitor, ran to
the cage and poked the leopard with a shovel until the animal
released Feinberg. Other keepers pulled the injured man from the
cage.
   A spokesman for the zoo said it was investigating the attack.
Veterinarians examining Fatima found only superficial wounds,
probably caused by the shovel.
   Contacted at the hospital, Feinberg refused to comment.
   In February, a keeper's back was fractured when he was knocked
into a moat by a 7,000-pound elephant.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev open their summit meeting with no clear answer to the
German question: How does a united German nation fit into a Europe
still haunted by the memories of Nazi aggression.
   Bush has made it clear he favors a united Germany as a full
member of the U.S.-led NATO alliance. But he is also said to be
prepared to explore ``options and positions'' on the size of
Germany's armed forces.
   Gorbachev is portrayed by Soviet officials as unlikely to be
convinced by Bush that the new Germany should be a full-fledged
NATO member. Indeed, he said Wednesday in Canada, before flying to
Washington for the summit, that such an idea was ``just like an old
record that seems to be playing the same note again and again.''
   In Washington, Georgi Arbatov, director of the Soviet Institute
for U.S. and Canada Studies, said, ``A military alliance against
the Soviet Union, that's the way we see NATO. It's an ominous
question for us.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday,
``We are opposed to any proposal which would single out Germany for
special limits.'' However, he added, ``President Bush will be
exploring the subject with President Gorbachev from the standpoint
of exploring mutually acceptable options and positions.''
   The Soviet Union suffered heavy losses at the hands of the
Germans in World War II, and feelings about that time still run
deep half a century later.
   ``The size of the Bundeswehr is of obvious concern to the
Soviets, and we understand that,'' said a U.S. official who
commented on condition he not be identified by name.
   The West German armed forces currently number some 494,000. The
East German military stood at 173,000 last year but may have been
cut somewhat since. It is unclear how many of East Germans might be
absorbed into the unified German military.
   At present there are 380,000 Soviet troops stationed in East
Germany and 250,000 U.S. troops in West Germany.
   In December, the two superpowers agreed to slash their central
European forces to 195,000 each, with the United States allowed to
keep an additional 30,000 troops in Britain and southern Europe.
With actual cuts yet to be made, there are now 305,000 U.S. troops
and an estimated 565,000 Soviet troops in Europe.
   Gorbachev told reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday he is confident
that he and Bush will find a way to preserve the balance of power
in Europe.
   Asked if he was optimistic about agreement on Germany and
whether it should be a NATO member, the Soviet leader replied: ``I
am sure of that. And tell that to the American people.''
   Bush has made his own position clear.
   ``I want to convince Mr. Gorbachev ... that a U.S. presence in
Europe, a unified Germany, a Germany in NATO, not only is no threat
to the Soviet Union, but preserves the kind of stable Europe that
the Soviets should welcome,'' Bush said in an interview broadcast
last weekend to the Soviet Union.
   ``I believe in President Bush's eloquence, but it is hard for me
to believe that he could manage to do this,'' Arbatov told a news
conference on Tuesday.
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz, speaking with
reporters Wednesday, said a Soviet attempt to define the terms of
German membership in NATO ``is unacceptable to us.''
   The United States, he said, wants rapid unification, in ``an
orderly fashion'' with Germany enjoying the privileges and
responsibilities of all other nations in Europe.
   ``That doesn't seem to be the Soviet approach,'' he said.
   The Soviets have ``a lot of legitimate concerns'' which the
United States and its allies must address, ``but not at the cost of
a fully sovereign Germany,'' Seitz said.
   The goal should be a Europe ``in which everyone will feel
safe,'' including the Soviet Union, Arbatov said.

<HEAD>Israel Says it Foiled Palestinian Attack on Beachfront Hotels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NIZZANIM, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers killed four Palestinian
guerrillas and captured 12 on Wednesday as they sped toward the
coastline in speedboats to launch attacks coinciding with the
Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
   The guerrilla faction of Abul Abbas, mastermind of the Achille
Lauro hijacking, claimed responsibility. It claimed all the boats
reached their targets and that 11 guerrillas escaped and rocketed
the coast at Tel Aviv and nearby towns.
   The group said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing
of seven Palestinians by an Israeli civilian last week, and for the
assassination of a Palestinian military leader two years ago.
   The Israeli army said the guerrillas planned to attack
beachfront hotels filled with people celebrating Shavuot, which
marks the giving of the Ten Commandments. The six small speedboats
were sent from a mothership that sailed from Libya, the army
alleged.
   No Israelis were killed or injured, the army said, although one
guerrilla speedboat outran an Israeli patrol boat and splashed
ashore near a crowded Mediterranean beach club.
   Police evacuated a 30-mile stretch of coast south of Tel Aviv
jammed with people on holiday.
   Of the six guerrilla vessels, only two got near shore,
authorities said.
   One carried 11 Palestinians. It was attacked by helicopters and
troops as it sliced into an almost empty beach near Nizzanim, 18
miles south of Tel Aviv. Four guerrillas were killed there and
seven captured, the army said.
   Zvi Amitai, a resident of the Nizzanim communal farm, said he
was collecting driftwood when he saw the speedboat and heard
gunfire. The guerrillas landed 20 yards away from him.
   ``They jumped from the boat and didn't shoot, as if they didn't
see us,'' he said. ``They just ran for the dunes. I certainly feel
like I won the lottery.''
   Five other guerrillas surrendered aboard another boat that was
intercepted by Israeli vessels near a beach north of Tel Aviv. The
other vessels broke down or were abandonded at sea, the army said.
   The armed forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said the
attack boats were armed with rockets, machine guns and
anti-aircraft missiles.
   ``The security forces ... were able to frustrate today an
operation that, if it was carried out successfully, would have
caused a great many casualties to Israeli citizens,'' he told a
news conference in Tel Aviv.
   Army intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak told the same
news conference: ``The goal was to attack the hotels in the Tel
Aviv region to conduct a massacre.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the PLO
violated its pledge not to engage in terrorism and was responsible
for an act that could have ``plunged this whole region into
bloodshed and a broad war.''
   It was unclear whether the attack had the endorsement of PLO
chief Yasser Arafat, who pledged in December 1988 to abandon
terrorism.
   The faction that claimed responsibility is the Palestine
Liberation Front, a pro-Arafat faction. Its leader is Mohammed
Abbas, whose nom de guerre is Abul Abbas. An Italian court
convicted him in absentia of masterminding the 1985 hijacking of
the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, during which American Leon
Klinghoffer was killed.
   Abbas was sentenced to life in prison, but his whereabouts is
not known. A PLF spokesman said Abbas was not in Iraq, where Arab
leaders Wednesday concluded a three-day summit with a sharp
denunciation of U.S. policies toward Israel.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said he hoped the incident would
convince Washington of the need to abandon its dialogue with the
PLO.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington, ``The United States is horrified at this terrorist
attack.'' She added that if it is determined the attackers had PLO
connections, ``we would view this as a very serious matter.''
   In Baghdad, PLF representative Hussein el-Abed said the attack
was aimed at ``teaching the enemy a new lesson on the road to
liberating Palestine.''
   He said the attack was in revenge for the killing of PLO
military chief Khalil Al-Wazir, whose death in Tunis in April 1988
was widely blamed on Israel.
   The front, in statements issued in Lebanon and Iraq, said the
raid also was in retaliation for the killing of seven Palestinians
by an Israeli civilian last week.
   It said 15 guerrillas _ not 16, as Israeli officials reported _
attacked points near Tel Aviv.
   ``All the boats succeeded in reaching their specified targets,''
it said.
   Al-Abed confirmed that four guerrillas were killed but denied
the others were captured.
   The Israeli army said the mothership fled toward Port Said in
Egypt and that Egyptian authorities were notified.
   Sunday's attack also came amid a cycle of violence set off by
the May 20 massacre of the Palestinian laborers.
   The slaying touched off riots in the occupied territories that
left 15 Palestinians dead. A pipe bomb explosion in a crowded
market killed an elderly Israeli man.
   Wednesday's raid was the largest Palestinian infiltration
attempt by sea since March 11, 1978, when a dozen guerrillas from
Arafat's Fatah PLO faction came ashore north of Tel Aviv and
hijacked a bus. The bus headed for Tel Aviv and 33 people died in a
shootout between the guerrillas and Israeli forced.
   The last infiltration was on March 8, 1988, when another Fatah
squad infiltrated from Egypt and hijacked a bus near Tel Aviv.
Three passengers were killed and eight wounded.

   Delegates to the annual convention of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) today elected a 67-year-old layman to
lead the 2.9 million-member denomination for the next year.
   Price H. Gwynn III of Charlotte, N.C., captured almost 53
percent of the votes on the second ballot at the denomination's
202nd General Assembly. Gwynn, immediately took office as
moderator, replacing the Rev. Joan SalmonCampbell of Philadelphia.
   Gwynn became the eighth moderator since factions of the church
reunited in 1983, healing a Civil War-era split over slavery. He
was one of six men seeking the position.
   During his nomination speech, Gwynn said Presbyterians were more
concerned about a perceived malaise in leadership than whether
homosexuals should be ordained _ an issue the 10-day assembly may
address.
   ``The question I'm asked is do we have our act together up
here... can we put aside our differences to get our act together in
the world,'' Gwynn told the assembly.
   The first meeting of the Protestant denomination in
predominantly Mormon Utah began Tuesday night with a worship
service where SalmonCampbell urged partipants to be humble and
gentle with each other.
   The denomination was planning to take action on its first
statement of faith since the 1983 merger. The proposed statement
mixes traditional Christian beliefs with more modern concerns for
the environment and sexual equality. Resolutions on the
environment, U.S.-Cuban relations and Northern Ireland also were on
the agenda.
   No official dialogue is planned between the Presbyterians and
the Mormon Church, although private meetings are scheduled between
Mormon leaders and the Presbyterian Inter-Faith Office. Further,
the conference will consider a paper on healthy relations between
Mormons and Presbyterians in Utah.
   While 70 percent of Utah's 1.7 million people are Mormons, the
next largest denomination is Roman Catholic, with an estimated 5
percent, or 80,000 members. The Presbyterians have 5,000 members,
or about six-tenths of 1 percent.
   Church officials acknowledge it is unusual to hold its annual
assembly where there are so few Presbyterians, but say the Salt
Lake meetings are in response to local Presbyterians seeking
recognition in Utah.
   During Tuesday night's service, delegates were urged to fill out
prayer cards, some of which were used during the service.
Participants were asked to take a card and pray for the request
throughout the convention.
   The service focused on children with children's choirs and
dancers, and a special Prayer of the Children, written by Richard
Wunder of Salt Lake.
   SalmonCampbell told commissioners and visitors to be mindful of
their behavior _ in thought, word and action. She urged them to
work together in humility and to be gentle with one another,
``positive in Christ's love.''
   She told commissioners that in such a democratic body, they can
expect conflict and disagreement, but to remember the life, death
and resurrection of the savior. ``The presence of the spirit waits
to assist each of us in doing God's work,'' she said.

<HEAD>Postal Service Says Some Doonesbury Stamps Appearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Doonesbury'' protest stamps are starting to
zonk their way into the mail, the Postal Service said Wednesday.
   Cartoonist Garry Trudeau included a sheet of mock stamps,
featuring Zonker Harris of the Doonesbury comic strip, in Sunday
papers May 20.
   The stamps carry the legend ``Mad as Heck'' and ``Ticked Off''
and show a value of -5, which the comic strip indicates is -5
cents. The stamps were intended to protest the coming increase in
postal rates from 25 cents to 30 cents.
   Postal Service spokesman Lou Eberhardt said an empty envelope
from California bearing two of the stamps arrived at Postmaster
Anthony Frank's office and that a few others have also been
delivered.
   But Eberhardt said he did not know how many of the stamps were
used.
   He said many envelopes with the stamps may have ended up in dead
letters offices for lack of postage. Some may have gotten through
because of the large volume of mail postal workers handle.
   Eberhardt said Frank finds Trudeau's work funny and takes the
stamps in the manner in which they were intended _ as a protest.
   Eberhardt said letter-writers should have no problem if they put
the cartoon stamps in addition to valid 25-cent stamps on their
mail.
   But if the Doonesbury stamps are the only ``postage'' on a
letter, that's not legal postage. If the letters appear to be of
value they would then either be returned to the sender marked
insufficient postage or to the addressee marked postage due,
officials said.

   Lithuanian leaders appealed to Presidents Bush
and Gorbachev Wednesday to ``solve'' at their summit the question
of the breakaway Baltic Republic where oil shortages threaten to
shut down heating systems.
   The Soviet economic blockade of Lithuania could also force the
shutdown of a nuclear power station that relies on electricity to
function, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said in a
videotaped appearance broadcast in the United States.
   Prunskiene and Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis made
their comments together in Vilnius on Tuesday.
   The session was beamed by satellite to the United States on the
day Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was arriving for a four-day
summit with President Bush.
   Lithuania is likely to be a topic of contention between the two
superpower leaders. The United States has urged the Soviet Union to
negotiate with Lithuanians about their future.
   ``We still hope that the negotiations taking place in Washington
will be in accordance with the attitudes of the American public and
will help solve the Lithuanian question,'' Prunskiene said.
   She said the economic situation in Lithuania is dire. Gorbachev
imposed the sanctions after Lithuania declared its independence
March 11.
   ``During this week, if there is no repeal of the restrictions in
furnishing Lithuania with a variety of products, especially oil,
then the situation becomes essentially critical,'' Prunskiene said.
   The nuclear power plant the Lithuanians say might have to close
supplies power to the region of Kaliningrad, which houses several
Soviet military bases.
   Landsbergis said it would be impossible for Lithuanians to
return to the status they had before they declared independence.
   ``Is it really possible to turn back the clock of history, even
by three months?'' he asked. ``Besides, why should it be turned
back? What are the arguments?''

   Demonstration organizers say their efforts will be peaceful
during Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's visits to
Minneapolis-St. Paul and San Francisco, but city, state and federal
agencies are beefing up security anyway.
   Protest groups and police shared one problem: Gorbachev's
changing schedule.
   ``The bad part is it doesn't give us much time to plan how to
protect him,'' said Richard McDrew, agent in charge of the Secret
Service in San Francisco. ``The good part is it doesn't give a
potential assassin time to plan, either. If we don't know exactly
what he is going to do, neither does anyone else.''
   The flags of the Baltic republics will fly Sunday in Minneapolis
to show Gorbachev that emigrants in Minnesota support the push for
independence by the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia.
   ``We will be demonstrating for Baltic independence, not against
Gorbachev coming here,'' said Karin Berkholtz, a Latvian-American
member of the Governor's Commission on Eastern Europe.
   ``Our ultimate goal is to show Gorbachev that `Everywhere you go
there will be people who feel the same way that they do back in
Eastern Europe,''' Berkholtz said.
   Between 500 and 1,000 people of Eastern European descent are
expected to participate in non-disruptive demonstrations during the
six hours the Soviet president is in Minnesota.
   After Minnesota, Gorbachev will go on to San Francisco, and then
leave the United States on Monday.
   The planned Minnesota demonstrations ``are not meant to offend
anyone,'' said Walter Anastas, the Ukrainian representative on the
Governor's Commission on Eastern Europe. ``We want to express to
Gorbachev and to our fellow Minnesotans that we have concerns about
the human right of national self-determination.''
   ``We're planning a peaceful demonstration, in keeping with the
peaceful revolution in the Baltics,'' said Joe Sidas, spokesman for
the Baltic Alliance in San Francisco.
   Security will be tight.
   Sharpshooters will be posted on buildings at every location the
Gorbachevs will visit in California. Dozens of Highway Patrol cars
will line the 35 miles between San Francisco and Stanford
University during their drive Monday to the campus.
   McDrew said the Secret Service will have hundreds of agents in
San Francisco from around the country leading a security operation
that will involve thousands of officers.
   The San Francisco Police Department will have 1,775 officers and
the Stanford University police will have 30 officers, bolstered by
Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies, to deal with demonstrations
planned by Armenians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Soviet Jews
and Eritreans from Ethiopia.
   Minnesota State Patrol Chief Kevin Kittridge said tentative
plans are for 150 to 200 state troopers from around the state to be
brought into St. Paul for Sunday's visit. ``We've canceled
everyone's day off,'' he said.
   But in Minneapolis, police Sgt. Keith Oldfather said there's
been no blanket prohibition on officers taking a scheduled day off
Sunday and that he doesn't expect one, although he said plans are
not firm because Gorbachev's itinerary is not set.
   ``It's very likely we won't know until the last minute or last
day exactly what we are going to do, in which case all our planning
and worrying was for nothing,'' said Minneapolis police Lt. Jim
Heimerl.
   If Gorbachev ventures into crowds to talk with protesters, as he
has in the past, it will present a risk, said McDrew, but one that
the Secret Service is preparing to handle.
   ``Extemporaneous visits and unplanned movements are things we've
handled before,'' he said. ``It's pretty difficult sometimes. John
F. Kennedy didn't want a bulletproof top on his car in Dallas. We'd
like to have the best security at all times, but we have to adapt
to the circumstances.''

   Longtime Hollywood star Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. reminisced about growing up in Rhode Island on a trip
here to plug a new television program.
   Fairbanks, 80, is host of ``Romance Classics'' on cable
television's American Movie Classics and was at Providence College
to introduce a screening of ``Wuthering Heights.''
   Fairbanks was not in ``Wuthering Heights,'' although he said he
took a test for the classic, which established the late Laurence
Olivier with American audiences.
   ``It was so bad that it was shown for a joke,'' he said of his
own screen test.
   Fairbanks recalled Tuesday the summers he spent in Westerly,
where his mother married his father long before stage actor Douglas
Fairbanks went off to Hollywood to become a silent screen star. The
house where they stayed, Kenneth Ridge, is now a rest home for nuns.
   On a visit a few years ago, Fairbanks asked ``if they ever
looked into the secret panels,'' he said.
   ``They didn't know anything about it. But I knocked on the walls
and found it. Inside there were three or four pieces of statuary,''
he said.

   A court battle between comedian Pat Paulsen
and his former wife is no joke, with Paulsen claiming she defrauded
him of $200,000 and Linda Chaney-Paulsen accusing him of
racketeering, libel and slander.
   Paulsen testified Tuesday in Jefferson County Court that he set
Chaney-Paulsen up in the booking business and she repaid him by
diverting money from business accounts of Pat Paulsen Enterprises
Inc. in Lakewood.
   She also hid business records from him, leaked harmful stories
about him to the National Enquirer and faked illnesses to get his
sympathy, Paulsen alleges in his lawsuit.
   Among other charges, Chaney-Paulsen claims in a countersuit that
the comedian married her, then filed for divorce simply to take
over the business that was in her name. She also claims Paulsen's
income rose dramatically while she arranged his bookings.

   ``I'll be out of here in a week, and I'll be back to normal
again real soon,'' Tower said in telephone interview from his
hospital room Tuesday night.
   ``And one thing for sure _ I'll never have prostate cancer again
because they took my prostate out.''
   He was listed in good condition Wednesday, said hospital
spokeswoman Susan Rutherford.
   Tower had a previous brush with cancer. A rectal polyp removed
in December 1988 contained some malignant cells. In January 1989, a
non-malignant polyp was removed from his colon.
   Tower's physician, Dr. Paul Peters, said Tower's recovery should
be ``unusually good.''
   President Bush reportedly is considering naming Tower chairman
of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Council. Tower was
appointed to the board last year after the Senate refused to
confirm him as defense secretary, amid allegations about his
personal life and possible conflicts of interest.

   A millionaire who once ran the largest
utility in Arkansas won a mudslinging Republican primary and will
challenge Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton, whose party nominated him
for a fifth term.
   The former head of Arkla Inc., Sheffield Nelson, beat Rep. Tommy
Robinson in a GOP race that was dominated by bitter accusations
over both men's relationship with Dallas Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones.
   In another primary Tuesday, Kentucky Democrats picked former
Louisville Mayor Harvey Sloane to challenge U.S. Sen. Mitch
McConnell, who had no trouble winning the Republican nomination for
a second term.
   Clinton had a somewhat tougher time than expected winning the
Democratic nomination for governor. Pre-election polls had shown
him with as much as a 30-point lead, but he won the race by 15
percentage points over his closest challenger, Tom McRae.
   With 98 percent of the precincts reporting, Clinton had 261,005
votes, or 54 percent, to 187,823, or 39 percent, for McRae, the
former president of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation. Four other
challengers split the remaining 7 percent.
   Clinton, who has been discussed as a potential presidential
candidate, said he wasn't disappointed.
   ``I feel great,'' he said. ``We ran better than we thought we
would ... in a lot of places.''
   ``Anybody in this campaign can tell you,'' he added, ``I was
always more worried about this race than the general _ always.''
   Nelson captured the GOP race by a 55-to-45 percent margin. With
94 percent of the precincts reporting, he had 47,690 votes to
Robinson's 39,515.
   The rancor of the campaign apparently helped deliver a record
turnout for a Republican primary in Arkansas _ at least 87,000
voters, compared with 68,000 in the 1988 GOP presidential primary.
Robinson, a lifelong friend of Jones, had criticized Nelson's
business relationship with the Cowboys owner. That, in turn, led to
a rift between Robinson and Jones.
   ``Now let me talk to the ones we defeated tonight,'' Nelson said
in his victory speech. ``I appeal to Tommy Robinson and his people
to come over and join us and let's have a unified effort to move
forward to November.''
   In Kentucky, Sloane defeated state schools Superintendent John
Brock in the Democratic primary. McConnell overwhelmed perennial
candidate Tommy Klein in the GOP race.
   Final, unofficial returns gave Sloane 183,629 votes, or 59
percent, to Brock's 125,496 votes, or 41 percent. McConnell had
64,019 votes, or 89 percent, to Klein's 8,219 votes, or 11 percent.
   Voters also renominated veteran Democratic congressmen in both
states.
   In Kentucky, Rep. Romano Mazzoli defeated former television
newsman Jeffrey Hutter and Alderman Paul Bather to capture
nomination for an 11th term. He faces a general election challenge
from Republican Al Brown, a personnel consultant who defeated
businessman Tim Hardy.
   In Arkansas, Rep. Bill Alexander, who has served in Congress for
22 years, fended off a strong Democratic primary challenge from
lawyer Mike Gibson, a political newcomer with strong business
backing. Alexander faces Republican challenger Terry Hayes in
November.

<HEAD>Aviation Pioneer Arthur Woodley Dies at 84</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur Woodley, an aviation pioneer who
brought air shuttle service to Alaska at a time when dog teams were
used to transport supplies there, has died at age 84.
   Woodley died Monday at his home in this Seattle suburb. The
cause of death was not given.
   In 1932, Woodley founded Woodley Airways, which offered
passenger service between Anchorage and Nome with the motto ``Have
Plane, Will Travel.'' It was a one-plane, one-pilot operation, but
quickly caught on as an alternative to the month-long dog-sled
journey.
   It also was cheaper.
   Woodley charged passengers $150; the dog-sled trip cost $750.
   ``There was an obvious need for an airline in Alaska, and dad
saw the need,'' said his son, Gordon, of Bellevue.
   Woodley extended credit to his passengers until the end of each
trapping season. He estimated he was owed $300,000 in 1935, but it
was all eventually paid.
   After Alaska's 1964 earthquake, with airports and airlines shut
down, Woodley stepped in.
   ``Dad said, `We're flying,' and he flew in everyone who had to
get in, and he flew out everyone he had to get out,'' his son
recalled. ``He never charged for it.''
   After World War II, Woodley changed his airline name to Pacific
Northern Airlines. He later sold to Western Airlines and became a
vice president of Western until he retired in 1971.
   Woodley is survived by his wife, Miriam, three sons and six
grandchildren.

   Officer Jim Viola had to think quickly.
A motorcyclist was trying to get away after a 120 mph chase. If
Viola didn't catch him, no one would.
   So, faster than you can say ``Information, please,'' Viola threw
the book at him. The phone book.
   ``I let him have it in the face,'' Viola said. ``It stunned him
... When you're going 20 to 25 and get hit with a phone book, it
gets your attention.''
   Bobby Roberson, 30, was booked with driving while intoxicated,
going more than 100 mph in a 55 mph zone, reckless driving, flight
from police and numerous traffic violations, said state police
Trooper David Staton.
   Viola said the only way to catch Roberson was by throwing the
phone book, which he keeps with him because he has a portable phone.
   Staton said the chase began Wednesday morning when he tried to
stop Roberson for weaving between lanes on U.S. 80 near Louisiana
Downs.
   ``As soon as I turned on my lights, he saw me and hit
(Interstate) 220 and opened it up,'' Staton said. He said the
motorcyclist tried to shake him by racing down a stretch of road
under construction, then taking a zig-zag 10-to 12-mile route up,
down and around Bossier City.
   He turned around at one roadblock, drove around three more, and
slowed to drive around Viola's car, also parked for a roadblock,
police said.
   ``I was the last unit I saw,'' said Viola. ``I knew if I didn't
stop him he was going to get away.''
   After Viola threw the book, Roberson fell into a ditch. He was
scratched but otherwise unhurt, Viola said.
   ``That's what is called directory assistance,'' he said.

<HEAD>Terry Waite Turns 51 Years Old In Captivity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican church envoy Terry Waite turns
51 Thursday, more than three years after he disappeared in Beirut
while trying to negotiate the freedom of other Western captives.
   No group has claimed it holds him, and there has been no word on
his fate. But Western and Lebanese intelligence officials are
convinced he is held by a Moslem group known as Islamic Jihad.
   He marks his 51st birthday a day after a Moslem Shiite cleric
with ties to kidnap groups said British hostages in Lebanon could
be released sooner if Britain expels author Salman Rushdie.
   Rushdie, who is in hiding under the protection of British
authorities, wrote ``The Satanic Verses.'' The novel offended many
Moslems and prompted the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran
to issue a death threat against the author in February 1989.
   Moslem fundamentalist leader Hussein Musawi said Wednesday the
deportation of Rushdie would ``greatly facilitate the release of
some British hostages.''
   Musawi, who heads the pro-Syrian faction within the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah did not provide names of the hostages he
had in mind.
   British official have said they will not deport Rushdie.
   Waite's brother, David Waite, said Wednesday that no events were
planned in Britain to mark the birthday.
   ``We think of Terry every day since he has been taken and
tomorrow will be just the same, and we'll all be thinking about
him,'' he told The Associated Press.
   ``We've been very encouraged'' by freed U.S. hostage Frank
Reed's account of seeing British hostages John McCarthy and Brian
Keenan, Waite's brother added.
   Reed and a second U.S. hostage, Robert Polehill, were freed last
month with the help of Iran and Syria.
   Waite said that while he supported the British government's
refusal to make deals for hostages, he believed Britain should talk
directly to Iran. He suggested that Britain ``mend its fences with
Iran ... now that it has been proved that Iran has direct influence
over the hostage-takers.''
   Waite is one of 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon. They are six
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman
and an Italian.
   Besides Waite, the British captives are McCarthy, a journalist
who was kidnapped April 17, 1986; ex-Royal Air Force pilot Jack
Mann, kidnapped May 12, 1989; and writer Alec Collett, kidnapped
March 25, 1985.
   In addition, teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual
British-Irish nationality, was abducted on April 11, 1986.
   The longest held captive is Terry Anderson, 43, of Lorain, Ohio.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Waite disappeared in Moslem west Beirut Jan. 20, 1987. He was
last seen leaving his seaside hotel to meet with kidnappers holding
Anderson and educator Thomas Sutherland.
   Waite, a policeman's son who became personal emissary of
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, told his Druse bodyguards
he did not want them to escort him to the clandestine meeting.
   Western hostages freed since Waite disappeared have reported
seeing a man believed to be the 6-foot, 7-inch Briton in an
underground prison.
   Waite's disappearance provoked several rumors about his fate. He
has been reported ill, released, killed, wounded while trying to
escape and smuggled to Iran.
   An anonymous telephone caller, purporting to speak for the
pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, another Shiite
faction, threatened to kill Waite on Aug. 1, 1989, unless Israel
freed a kidnapped Shiite leader, Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.
   Though Obeid was kept imprisoned, no one later claimed Waite was
killed.

   The government said Wednesday that
East German property expropriated by the former Communist
leadership should be returned to its original owners, some of whom
now live in West Germany.
   The statement signaled a possible dispute with the East Berlin
government over how to handle West German claims on houses,
apartments and businesses in East Germany.
   Berlin officials insist that instead of getting their property
back, former owners should be paid some sort of compensation. East
Germany also says its own citizens should have first option on
property that was formerly state-owned.
   West German experts say up to 1 million people will lay claim to
property they left behind when fleeing to the West after World War
II or during East Germany's 40 years of Communist rule.
   How to handle such claims is a sensitive issue, because in many
cases the property is occupied. The issue was excluded from a
treaty on merging the German economies to buy time for reaching a
mutually agreeable solution.
   The economic merger is to occur July 2. On that date, East
Germany has said it will begin dismantling state ownership, without
any decision on what to do about West German claims on East German
property.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government met Wednesday to
discuss the fast-approaching economic merger. According to Kohl's
chief spokesman, Hans Klein, the issue of private ownership came up.
   Klein said the Bonn government ``expressed certain expectation
that private property will be guaranteed and that a socially
bearable solution will be found in the short term to the still-open
property questions.''
   ``Expropriated property is, in principle, to be handed back.
Only in exceptional cases should compensation solutions be found,''
Klein said.
   West Germany is apparently also waiting to hear from East
Germany on how it plans to guard against currency speculators
reaping profits when the West German mark becomes East Germany's
own legal tender July 2.
   West German Finance Minister Theodor Waigel rejected demands by
the opposition Social Democrats that Bonn spend additional money
for East Germany's economic reconstruction.
   West Germany already plans massive financial help for East
Germany as part of the economic merger.
   Up to 2 million East Germans are expected to lose their jobs and
prices are expected to soar during the transition.

   Dozens of police showed up to deal with an
expected crowd of summit protesters near the White House Wednesday,
but the only demonstrators on hand were a Soviet rock band
promoting AIDS research.
   Lafayette Park across Pennsylvania Avenue from the presidential
residence normally is protest central for meetings such as the
summit this week between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
President Bush.
   And up to 2,000 demonstrators had been expected Wednesday,
according to reservations issued by the U.S. Park Police to groups
representing the interests of Lithuanians, Cubans, Vietnamese,
South Koreans and AIDS victims.
   But Cure AIDS Now was the only organization that showed up,
bringing along the Soviet rock band Gaza to blast out some tunes.
It was the most visible, and audible, presence in the park.
   Other demonstrators, said one U.S. Park Police officer,
``probably figured out that Gorbachev's not even in town yet.''
   Instead of protesters, the park hosted the usual groups of
homeless, chess players, tourists and office workers seeking a
sunny respite from their desks.
   At two previous summits _ in 1985 in Geneva and in 1987 in
Washington when Gorbachev met with then-President Ronald Reagan _
Cure AIDS Now had demanded that each side devote the monetary
equivalent of 10 missiles to eradicate the deadly disease and care
for its victims, said the organization's leader, Bob Kunst.
   The ante is up this year.
   ``We want the value of 1,000 missiles now,'' said Kunst, 47.
``We see AIDS as as catastrophic as nuclear war.'' He estimated
that each missile costs $180 million.
   As for the timing of his demonstration, he said, ``This is a
little teaser, an appetizer, to take advantage of the press here.
We hope Gorby sees us when he comes in, on television.''
   Also in the park Wednesday was Concepcion Picciotto, 45. But
then, she's been there since 1981 as part of the anti-nuclear peace
vigil.
   ``I want to do something for humanity,'' she said, handing out a
leaflet that reads: ``Every gun that is made, every warship
launched, ever rocket fired, signifies a theft from those who are
hungry and are not fed, from those who are cold and are not
clothed.''
   Misha Knight, who emigrated from the Soviet Union in 1978
because he ``did not see a future there,'' said he came to this
summit to show support for the growing friendship between the
United States and his homeland.
   He also was selling Gorbachev T-shirts _ $15 each _ and an $8
cassette tape featuring himself singing ``I Am a Gorby Man,'' and
``Give Peace a Hand,'' among other tunes.

   Several hundred Armenian demonstrators lined the
street outside the National Gallery of art Wednesday yelling,
``Karabakh! Karabakh!'' as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
went inside for a brief tour.
   Across the street, in front of Ottawa's Cathedral, hundreds of
people gathered to demonstrate on behalf of the three breakaway
Baltic republics. They carried placards, waved flags and chanted in
their native languages.
   ``It's just a reminder that whether Gorbachev's in Soviet
territory or Canada, there are Baltic people everywhere,'' said
Maimu Palumae, a 23-year-old Canadian of Estonian extraction who
protested earlier outside Parliament.
   Albin Barsauskas, 71, said he was one of 94 members of the
Lithuanian Golden Age Club of Montreal who arrived in Ottawa on two
buses. Although he did not see Gorbachev, he said he was not
disappointed.
   ``I don't want to shake his hand anyway,'' he said. ``I just
want to ask nicely: Give us freedom, take away army, no blockade.''
   Gorbachev has been struggling with the leaders of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia, which were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union
in 1940 and have been seeking to secede. He imposed economic
sanctions on Lithuania after it declared its independence.
   He also has been troubled by violence between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis. They are battling for control of the mostly Armenian
enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is controlled and surrounded by
the republic of Azerjaijan.
   Armenian demonstrators outside the art gallery waved the red,
blue and orange flags of their homeland.
   ``I'm screaming for my people,'' said Gevork Abrikian, 23, a
professional musician from Armenia visiting friends in Canada. ``It
may not do anything, but I'll feel a little bit better because I've
done it.''
   Outside Canada's gothic, gray stone Parliament building, a crowd
of demonstrators estimated between 500 and 2,000 people chanted and
waved flags of the three Baltic republics.
   Inside, Gorbachev was meeting with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   ``Red Army: Get civilized, stop murdering our sons,'' said a
placard signed, ``Latvian mothers.'' Another sign said: ``Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia are still in a Soviet labor camp.''
   Some people distributed leaflets showing a caricature of Soviet
tanks and the words: ``Red Army Go Home.''
   Police lined the perimeter of the lawn and set up a barricade to
hold back the crowd.
   Lauri Vahtra, 22, an Estonian visiting relatives in Canada, said
he believed his republic faces a ``now-or-never'' situation.
   ``Everything is getting worse, economically, culturally. We need
our freedom, and I think it's the last chance for us.''
   Several hundred schoolchildren also gathered on the lawn outside
Parliament to greet Gorbachev, not with protests but with cheers.
   During his two-day visit to Canada, Gorbachev twice went among
Ottawans to shake hands, answer questions and chat amiably. He
spent about an hour on one of his trademark ``walkabouts'' Tuesday
night, and then on Wednesday walked with Mulroney a short distance
from Canada's war memorial toward Parliament Hill.
   Imre Sooaar, 21, a deserter from the Soviet Army who arrived in
Canada in March 1989, said he had shaken Gorbachev's hand and
managed to speak with him three times in the last two days by
following him to virtually every public appearance in Ottawa. Their
longest conversation took place on a pedestrian mall Tuesday
evening.
   ``I really felt when I was looking into his eyes that he
personally would like to give us freedom,'' Sooaar said.

<HEAD>Judge's Ruling Lets Chicago's Beer Gardens Roll Out the Barrels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a long, dry spring at some of Chicago's
outdoor beer gardens because of a lengthy, new licensing process,
but a court order temporarily turned on the taps Wednesday.
   Neighbors' complaints prompted the city to make taverns get
permission if they wanted to serve outdoors. But a judge ruled the
city was trying to do with licensing regulations what its police
could not _ adequately monitor the burgeoning number of outside
bars.
   ``It's good news for people who want to sit on Dick's Dock and
drink,'' Jeremy DeBlieux, manager of Dick's Last Resort, rejoiced
Wednesday as he readied his beer garden along a slip by the Chicago
River.
   ``We lost the entire month of May,'' DeBlieux said. ``There is
no catching up. But we're very, very happy that the beer will once
again flow.''
   On Tuesday, Cook County Circuit Judge Kenneth Gillis temporarily
prohibited enforcement of the new law until June 7, when he will
hear arguments on whether the ordinance should be tossed out. Two
tavern owners are challenging the law.
   Gillis said the city apparently ``jeopardized financial
interests (of the owners) as a substitute for effective police
enforcement.''
   The city adopted the new licensing procedure last fall;
previously taverns with liquor licenses could open a garden without
further review.
   But tavern owners say the licensing requirements are a maze from
which there seems to be no exit.
   Of an estimated 125 taverns that previously served beer and
other libations outdoors, only 21 had obtained the city's stamp of
approval to open their beer gardens for business by Tuesday.
   Two were denied permission for gardens because of strong
objections from neighbors, said John Holden of the city's
Department of Revenue, which handles the licenses. He said about
110 are going through the application process.
   ``These bar owners brought it on themselves,'' said David
Hartsell, who led a neighborhood group opposing a beer garden.
``This is not little European cafes we're talking about _ the beer
garden behind my house is like `Animal House.' It's like having a
frat party in my back yard every night.''
   That bar, Kincade's, withdrew its application but planned to
take advantage of the judge's ruling and open its garden, said
owner Kevin Killerman.
   The ordinance requires barkeepers to head for the city's Maps
Bureau, where a circle representing 250 feet is drawn around the
beer garden.
   Then the Building Department determines what addresses fall
within the circle. Next, the Board of Elections gives the owner a
list of voters living within the circle.
   The voters are notified by registered mail of the tavern's
intent, and have 30 days to respond. Owners then post notices of
intent and wait at least another 21 days for city inspections of
the property.
   ``With anything that's starting up, you expect to learn from
your experience,'' Holden said. ``We don't think the process is
terribly complicated.''
   Mayor Richard M. Daley also stands behind the new requirements.
   ``We're going to go back to court ... to defend the city's
position,'' mayoral spokeswoman Carolyn Grisko said. ``We think the
law is important.''
   Hartsell agrees.
   ``We hope the city vigourously defends this,'' he said. ``We
don't think it's a burden or unfair that for the first time the
neighbors have some input.''

   The State Department condemned the abortive
terrorist attack on a crowded beach area in Israel on Wednesday,
and left open the possibility that the incident could derail the
U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said if Israeli allegations that
the PLO was behind the attack are true, ``we would view this as a
very serious matter.''
   Asked whether the United States would suspend its dialogue with
the PLO if a faction of the organization were found to be
responsible, she said, ``Our policy has not changed, but I do not
want to ... rule anything in or anything out.''
   The attack prompted calls by the Israeli government and the
Anti-Defamation League for a suspension of the U.S.-PLO dialogue,
which began in December 1988 in the waning days of the Reagan
administration.
   The Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations
called on the administration to reassess its policy of talking with
the PLO.
   President Reagan agreed to open the dialogue after PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat gave forceful assurances that the group had renounced
terrorism.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the armed forces chief of staff, said
Wednesday the raid was carried out by the Palestine Liberation
Front, a PLO faction headed by Abul al-Abbas, who masterminded the
Achille Lauro cruise ship hijacking in 1985. A western news agency
in Israel said the PLF claimed responsibility for the Wednesday
attack by speedboats near Tel Aviv.
   But Ms. Tutwiler said U.S. officials were still gathering facts
about the incident and were unable to assess responsibility for it.
She said the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, was
trying to contact PLO officials in Tunis. In Washington, Assistant
Secretary of State for Near East and South Asian Affairs John Kelly
spoke with Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad.
   ``The United States is horrified at this terrorist attack,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said. ``The U.S. government is pleased that all terrorists
were apprehended or killed in action and that no innocent victims
were harmed.''
   In March, the State Department issued a report asserting the PLO
had complied with Arafat's 1988 pledge not to engage in terrorism.
It stated there was no evidence any of nine attacks directed
against Israel since then were approved by Arafat or any of the
groups under the PLO umbrella.
   Kelly ran into a storm of criticism last week from some House
members when he testified on the report.
   Rep. Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., called the report a ``sham and a
fraud'' and said the administration ``ought to be ashamed of
itself.''

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of the disarmament
agreement signed by Contra rebels and the government on Wednesday.
   Protocol of Managua on Disarmament
   Within the spirit of the declaration of Managua, signed May 4 of
this year, the Resistance, the government of Nicaragua and his
Eminence, the most Rev. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, through the
present document agree:
   1. To ease the fulfillment of what is included on the
``commitment to guarantee the physical and moral integrity of each
and every one of the combatants of the Nicaraguan Resistance, their
families and the civilian population that accompanies them'' in the
following way:
   a) Immediate transfer of the seriously ill so that they receive
indispensable medical attention in the country's hospitals.
   b) Immediate transfer of the war handicapped and wounded for
specialized attention in Managua.
   c) Create a commission of the government, Nicaraguan Resistance,
the International Verification Commission and his Eminence, the
most Rev. Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, to travel to Honduras and
Costa Rica for the purpose of carrying out an exhaustive
investigation of the living conditions of the relatives of the
resistance and applying emergency measures to solve the problems
that are found.
   d) The Resistance is urged to present immediately the list of
widows and orphans so that the INSSBI (Nicaraguan Institute of
Social Security and Well-being) includes them in its budget and
they receive the monthly pensions to which they have the right.
   2. Establish by common agreement among the parties the
development zone described in the document on the zones called ``El
Almendro,'' based on the proposal presented by the government.
Begin on this date a series of necessary actions for the
implementation and installation of the demobilization in the zones.
   3. The Nicaraguan government agrees to provide minimal economic
aid to each person who is demobilized.
   4. Create immediately an internal police with participation of
the former Resistance combatants, for the fundamental purpose of
guaranteeing the life and physical integrity of the citizens who
live in the development zones. Also established is the intention
that these police will become part of the structure of the Interior
Ministry. The United Nations or a friendly nation will be asked for
technical advice for the professional training of the police.
   5. Create the security condtions in the demilitarized zones, for
which it is considered necessary:
   a) Request the expansion of the mandate of the U.N. security
forces for Central America.
   b) That the government complement the assistance for the
demobilized who leave the security zone.
   c) Desmilitarize the conflict zone.
   d) Continue picking up weapons from civilians in the conflict
zones.
   6. Guarantee the security of the former combatants who
demobilize and leave the security zones and who locate in the
development zones. At the same time, maintain the option for those
who want to return to their place of origin. It is understood that
they will assume the risks of any other citizen.
   7. The government agrees to name a representative of the
demobilized recommended by the Resistance to the ministries that
deal with the former combatants and their families: health,
agrarian reform, labor and others, as well as two members of the
board of directors of the Nicaraguan Repatriation Institute.
   8. The Nicaraguan government pledges to give former combatants
of the Resistance who have located in the development zones
participation in the local government, that is to say, within the
development zone.
   At the same time, the former combatants who return to their
place of origin will receive from the state the support necessary
for their involvement in civilian life.
   9. The Managua declaration is ratified in each and every one of
its points, placing particular emphasis on references to the fact
that the Resistance may become a political party, which will allow
its clear involvement in the political life in this country.
   10. In fulfillment of the Toncontin agreement and its addendum,
the Resistance ratifies its commitment to demobilization and
disarmament at the latest June 10, 1990.
   To that effect the Resistance agrees to demobilize a minimum of
100 combatants per day per zone beginning on this date. At the same
time, in honor of Mother's Day, a considerable number of Nicaraguan
Resistance combatants will be demobilized.
   Presented in the city of Managua, May 30, 1990
   Signed: Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, President of the Republic
   Israel Galeano, Commander Franklin (for the Resistance)
   Miguel Obando y Bravo, Cardinal of Managua

   Two Air National Guard fighter jets
collided in a ball of flame Wednesday during a training flight over
northwestern Iowa but both pilots and a civilian passenger
parachuted to safety.
   Debris from the two A-7 jets tumbled to the ground over a wide
area in farm fields two miles north of Royal. There were no reports
of damage on the ground.
   ``They just hit head on,'' said John Schultz, who saw the
collision from his home in Spencer, eight miles northeast of the
crash site and about 70 miles southeast of Sioux Falls, S.D.
   ``Each one exploded in a ball of fire, and that was it. I didn't
see the parachutes.''
   The three people aboard the planes did eject and used their
parachutes, said Air Guard Lt. Ruth Christopherson.
   The three were South Dakota Air National Guard pilots Maj.
GregoS.D.) Argus Leader, said Christopherson.
   ``They're all fine, ready to be released to go home,'' she said.
   Bushee was along as part of a public affairs program to acquaint
civic leaders with the operation of the National Guard, she said.
   Lt. Reid Christopherson, executive officer of the South Dakota
Air National Guard, said the planes were among four A-7s taking
part in a training mission from the Air Guard's 114th Tactical
Fighter Group, based at Sioux Falls.
   The two other planes returned to Sioux Falls.
   Witnesses said the four jets were conducting maneuvers that
resembled mock dogfighting.
   ``I was outside hanging up laundry and I heard the planes flying
up above, and usually they're so high up it's hard to see them,''
said Joni Griffith, who lives on a farm near the crash site. ``It
sounded like they got louder, and I looked up and saw the two
bright flames, the fires.
   ``I watched for a second and watched one of the flames start
doing a nose dive. And I ran around a garage and I watched it go
all the way to the ground and explode.''
   The A-7 fighters cost about $3 million each to build and are
used by Air National Guard units all across the country. They were
flying in approved air space over a sparsely populated area that is
mostly farmland, Christopherson said.
   The fighters collided about 25 miles north of where a United
Airlines DC-10 was flying when an engine exploded July 19. The
explosion knocked out the plane's hydraulic system, which powers
flight controls, and the plane crashed during an emergency landing
in Sioux City, killing 112 people.

<TEXT>
   Raisa Gorbachev, like millions of tourists
who have visited San Francisco, will tour Fisherman's Wharf and
several other popular spots while her husband meets with executives
at a business luncheon.
   Mrs. Gorbachev is scheduled to take a one-hour whirlwind tour of
the city from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. on June 4 after she and her husband,
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, return from his speech at
Stanford University.
   Among the sights listed on an itinerary released Wednesday are
Golden Gate Park, Civic Center, Davies Symphony Hall, the Bank of
America Building and Fisherman's Wharf, with possible stops at the
M.H. de Young Museum and the Opera House.
   Mrs. Gorbachev is expected to be escorted by Tatyana Kamenev,
wife of the Soviet consul general, and perhaps Sherry Agnos, wife
of Mayor Art Agnos, said Charlotte Mailliard Swig, San Francisco's
chief of protocol.
   ``They won't have much time, but I think she'll like it and come
back,'' Swig said. ``I just hope they don't stop in Civic Plaza.''
   Civic Plaza, across from City Hall, has become a campground for
the homeless in recent years.
   After returning to the consul general's residence, where she and
her husband are staying, Mrs. Gorbachev will meet with Friends of
Raisa Gorbachev, including women who have met her on trips to the
Soviet Union to promote peace.
   The Gorbachevs are scheduled to leave at 5:30 p.m. for a view of
the Golden Gate Bridge at Vista Point before going to San Francisco
International Airport for their departure at 6:30 p.m.

<HEAD>USDA Forecasts Farm Exports Up Slightly from February Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department forecast Wednesday
that American agricultural exports for the fiscal year ending in
September would total $40 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion from
the previous estimate.
   The department revised the estimated volume of U.S. agricultural
exports upward by 1.5 million metric tons from the February
forecast to 150 million metric tons.
   Much of the increase, however, is the result of a change in the
way shipments between the United States and Canada are reported,
the department said in its report.
   It said the alteration was designed to eliminate under-reporting
of exports by both countries.
   The department added, however, that the prospects for exports of
U.S. corn, soybeans and cotton have improved since February in both
volume and price.
   Meanwhile, USDA raised the forecast for U.S. agricultural
imports from $21.5 billion to $22 billion.
   It said the main reason was an upswing in fruit and vegetable
imports from Latin America in the wake of December's freeze in
Florida and Texas.
   The department forecast the U.S. agricultural surplus for the
year at $18 billion, only a shade below that for fiscal 1989.
   The surplus had been rising steadily since fiscal 1986 when it
skidded to $5.4 billion. In terms of volume, the estimate of $150
million tons is up from last year's total of $146.4 million.

   President Bush wants India and Pakistan to
stop preparing for war and hold talks about Kashmir, where the
Indian government has cracked down on a militant Islamic
secessionist movement.
   ``I urge you to seek negotiation and conciliation rather than
confrontation,'' Bush said Tuesday as newly arrived Ambassador Abid
Hussain presented his credentials at a White House ceremony.
   The Indian Embassy later released the statements by Bush and
Hussain.
   More than 400 people have been killed since January when the
Indian crack down began. Kashmir is the only predominantly Moslem
state in Hindu-dominated India. Pakistan is a Moslem country.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz told foreign
correspondents Wednesday that Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev will discuss the Kashmir dispute at their Washington
summit that begins Thursday.
   ``Kashmir has turned into a flash point on the international
scene,'' Seitz said. Other U.S. officials have referred to it as
one of the world's most worrisome regional crises.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence
from Britain in 1947, two over Kashmir. Both India and Pakistan are
regarded as capable of producing atomic weapons.
   Bush told the Indian ambassador the United States believes the
1972 Simla agreement is the ``best framework for a peaceful
resolution of the dispute, and we call on both India and Pakistan
to begin bilateral talks without preconditions.''
   Pakistan, accusing Indian security forces of wanton killing and
repression in Kashmir, has maintained that the Simla pact doesn't
preclude third-party mediation. Pakistani officials reportedly have
approached the U.N. Security Council.
   Hussain did not name Kashmir in his statement, but referred
indirectly to the dispute.
   ``Terrorism and fundamentalism are direct threats to the secular
and representative character of our political system,'' he said.
``We cannot condone the activities of those who espouse violence
for political ends and take up arms to undermine the unity and
integrity of the state.''

   Firefighters at a chemical plant worked
Wednesday to contain a gas leak aboard a ship and prevent an
explosion from the mixture of two chemicals, officials said.
   Freeport's 12,000 residents were urged to stay inside and to
close all windows.
   About 20,000 gallons of amino ethyl ethanolamine were in the
Marine Chemist's tank Tuesday night when about 5,000 gallons of
1,3-dichloropropene were accidentally added, said Margaret Gaspard,
a Dow Chemical Co. spokeswoman.
   The flow of dichloropropene was stopped when employees realized
a reaction was occurring and heat was increasing within the tank,
she said.
   ``The venting of the gases has decreased and the temperature of
the reaction has decreased by half and that's a good sign,'' Dow
spokeswoman Cindy Suggs said Wednesday afternoon.
   Firefighters were pouring water on the ship moored at the
plant's dock and the Coast Guard closed traffic on the Intracoastal
Waterway, Police Chief Charles Bankston said.
   No injuries were reported, but plant employees were evacuated,
as were a few residents downwind and students from three schools,
authorities said.
   Dow officials said breathing high concentrations of the gas
could cause lung irritation but said levels being released should
pose no problems.
   ``Right now it appears that the only problem anyone will
experience will be throat irritation if exposed to very large
quantities,'' Ms. Suggs said.
   A recording at the Dow offices also urged Freeport residents to
stay inside, close all outside ventilation and not to use air
conditioners. The recording also advised residents having breathing
problems to apply a wet cloth over their mouths.
   The gas is made up of ammonia, hydrogen chloride and some light
hydrocarbons, Ms. Gaspard said.
   Amino ethyl ethanolamine is used in products such as shampoo and
cleaners, according to Dow. It said 1,3-dichloropropene is a soil
fumigant and used as a fungicide.

<HEAD>Advocates Claim Consumers Coerced in Car Coverage Rentals</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers are being coerced by car rental
companies into purchasing unneeded damage coverage, an advocacy
group charged Wednesday.
   An industry organization claimed, however, that only about one
in five renters purchases the so-called collision damage waiver,
which pays for a wrecked or stolen car.
   ``A lot of people don't need it at all but are buying it out of
fear,'' said Lucinda Sikes, a staff attorney for the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group. ``It's just a way for (rental companies)
to make a lot of profit. The product itself is inherently a fraud
on consumers.''
   Sikes also claimed the coverage _ which can add as much as 48
percent to the rental price _ costs too much for those who do need
it.
   ``It really should be only a few dollars a day,'' she said.
   In a 23-page report entitled ``Taking Consumers for A Ride: A
Report on Collision Damage Waivers,'' the group said the waivers
are often ``sold under coercive circumstances, at excessive prices
and with deceptive statements about coverage.'' The report was
compiled from a survey of 10 Washington-area companies.
   Sikes claimed consumers often aren't told about exceptions to
the waivers, which may be voided for reasons ranging from travel on
a gravel road to driving after having o available for objects
older than that.
   In the new work, the researchers dated coral samples with both
carbon-14 dating and a second method, which depends on the constant
radioactive transformation of uranium-234 into thorium-230.
   The second method, like the tree rings, provided an independent
measure for calibrating the carbon-14 data.
   In a telephone interview, Zindler said the newfound accuracy
cleared up an inconsistency in a climate theory.
   Scientists had theorized that subtle changes in Earth's orbit
affected growth and melting of glaciers by changing the amount of
solar energy to reach the surface, he said.
   But previous carbon-14 dating of ancient coral clashed with that
theory by suggesting the last peak of glaciation was about 18,000
years ago, he said.
   The corrected date from the new study was 21,500 years ago,
which ``fits with that theory very well,'' Zindler said.

high school student, the latest case in which police say the system
is helping criminals get away.
   Georgia issued new plates this year, the first since 1983, but
hasn't entered them on the national law enforcement computer
network. After the new tags went on, some residents traveling out
of state found themselves jailed on stolen car charges because of
the unlisted plates.
   And police say criminals stand a better chance of escape.
   ``When a law enforcement officer cannot give his all to his job,
the citizens of the state are losing,'' said Appling County Sheriff
Lewis Parker. ``When it takes hours to find out the tags, and when
we know that somewhere the tag is on file, it's also dangerous to
the citizens.''
   Jeff Davis County Sheriff Mark Hall said the slow process of
tracing license numbers added four days to the search for the
killer of Rhonda Sue Coleman, a Jeff Davis High School senior slain
two weeks ago in Hazelhurst.
   Information on a partial license number was received Thursday
from a man who said he saw a dark truck the night Miss Coleman
disappeared.
   But 84 Georgia counties have issued license plates containing
the sequence of numbers the man described, Hall said. Officers have
started calling all 84 county license plate offices.
   A legislator who thinks funds for a new computer system is
overdue worries that it will take a disaster to spur the state to
action.
   ``What's going to happen is some drunk will run a school bus off
the road and kill a bunch of kids and everybody will get up in arms
and not be able to find the person who did it,'' said state Rep.
Jerry D. Jackson, chairman of the House Motor Vehicles Committee.
   Division of Motor Vehicles officials estimate that it will take
up to five months to record information on license plates purchased
this year because Georgia lacks a network that would link computers
in each county to the state processing center.
   The state has clerks working late into the night six days a week
to computerize the data. In some weeks, they process 180,000 of the
6 million records which must be updated.

<HEAD>US Worried That Mauritania May Be Used as Missile Test Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed concern
Wednesday over reports that the West African country of Mauritania
may become a testing site for development of medium-range
ballistics missiles.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler suggested that a
``Middle East'' country may be involved in the reported program but
she refused to be more specific.
   She was responding to a report in The Washington Times that Iraq
plans to use Mauritania for missile testing. The Times story said
Iraq has begun delivering parts of fixed-missile launchers to
Mauritania.
   ``We are naturally concerned over reports that Mauritania may be
a testing site for missiles from another country,'' she said.
   ``Such a development would be worrisome both with respect to
missile proliferation in the Middle East and to regional stability
in West Africa.
   ``We have expressed these concerns to the government of
Mauritania and we will continue to monitor the situation.''

<HEAD>Shiite Leaders Says Hostage Release ``Remains Frozen''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese Shiite Moslem leader with close
ties to groups holding hostages said efforts to release six
Americans held in Lebanon remain frozen because of negative U.S.
positions.
   Hussein Musawi, head of the Islamic Amal faction based in east
Lebanon, spoke a day after the Bush administration announced it had
provided Iran with information on Iranians missing in Lebanon as a
gesture of goodwill.
   In an interview on the Lebanese Voice of the People radio
station, he said ``those concerned in Iran and Syria are dismayed
by the negative American stands.''
   At a May 3 news conference, President Bush said he hoped that
providing Iran with information on the fate of the four missing
Iranians would satisfy Iran's request for a gesture of thanks for
its role in freeing two U.S. hostages. Bush also said he remained
firmly opposed to negotiating for the release of the remaining six
American hostages in Lebanon.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday in
Washington that the United States had concluded that the Iranian
were dead. He said the information was passed to Tehran via the
Swiss government.
   Musawi's Islamic Amal is a pro-Syrian faction within the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah is believed to
be the umbrella for extremist factions holding most of the 16
Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   Iranian leaders said on Wednesday they had evidence their four
missing countrymen were still alive.
   ``Following the Islamic republic's inquiry into the fate of
Iranian hostages in Lebanon, we have got information from reliable
sources over the past few days that our hostages are alive,'' said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Morteza Sarmadi. He was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``The Islamic republic will continue efforts to obtain more
detailed information about the situation of its hostages,'' he said.
   Sarmadi gave no more details on the fate of the Iranians.
   Iran has repeatedly said that information on the fate of the
four Iranians is one condition for helping gain the release of the
16 Western hostages held in Lebanon, most by pro-Iranian factions.
   The four Iranians were seized in July 1982 at a Lebanese Forces
checkpoint at Badara, the northernmost point in the Christian
enclave, 25 miles north of Beirut.
   The kidnapped men included Ahmad Motevaselian, the commander of
a contingent of Iranian Revolutionary Guards based in the Bekaa
Valley of east Lebanon, a diplomat, a photographer and their driver.
   Sources in the Lebanese Forces have said the Iranian prisoners
were killed in artillery battles between the militia and Moslem
factions, including the Iranian-backed Hezbollah or Party of God.
   But there have been unconfirmed reports that three of the
Iranians are alive, and the fourth was shot trying to escape.
   Of the 16 Westerners held hostage, the longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Also held is Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, who turns 51 on
Thursday, more than three years after he disappeared in Beirut
while trying to negotiate the freedom of other Western captives.
   Musawi on Wednesday reiterated earlier remarks that the
deportation by Britain of writer Salman Rushdie would ``greatly
facilitate the release'' of at least some of the British hostages
in Lebanon.
   Rushdie, an Indian-born naturalized Briton, was sentenced to
death Feb. 14, 1989, by Iran's late revolutionary leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding under British protection ever since.

   Sen. David Durenberger, already the subject of
an ethics probe, said Wednesday he failed to report an earlier gift
and loan, while Senate colleagues disclosed they talked, wrote,
invested and even fiddled to raise their incomes last year.
   Durenberger, R-Minn., amended his financial reports for five
years to acknowledge a friend's gift of 35 days of lodging in
Florida and a $484,000 loan to buy a house. He is being
investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee because of a $100,000
book-promotion deal that was not listed on past disclosure reports.
   The figures on income, speaking fees and gifts for senators were
included in financial disclosure reports that were made public on
Wednesday.
   Although there is growing concern about the practice of
accepting fees for speaking to special interests, a compilation by
the Common Cause lobbying organization showed 74 senators spoke for
pay last year. By next year, the report said, 34 senators will no
longer keep such fees, compared with 19 in 1988.
   The 74 collected $2.7 million, donated $685,449 to charity, and
kept the rest, Common Cause said.
   Although Democrats control the Senate, the top two Republicans
earned more in speaking fees in 1989. Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas picked up $108,900 in honoraria; his deputy, Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, got $90,600. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, senior Republican
on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, was paid $92,499 in
fees.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, was paid $39,000 for
speeches, but his deputy, Alan Cranston, D-Calif., no longer
accepts honoraria.
   One of the wealthiest senators, John Heinz, R-Pa., whose family
started the food company, reported assets that could exceed $17
million; his income for the year may have topped $2.5 million. Sen.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo., whose family founded Ralston Purina,
disclosed holdings that could be in the $15-million range.
   Sen. Claiborne, Pell, D-R.I., may have made $2.8 million or more
last year; his assets were in the $8 million range. Also among the
richer senators are Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., whose assets are
hidden in a trust; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., with vast real estate
holdings, and Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., owner of the Milwaukee Bucks
basketball team. Kohl's 1989 income could have topped $20 million.
   On the other hand, Sens. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., and Conrad Burns,
R-Mont., could be on the brink of insolvency, with more liabilities
than assets. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., reported little in
the way of assets except his home, and liabilities that include
loans to pay for a son's college education.
   The law requires most high-level federal officials to report
annually on their assets, liabilities, financial transactions and
gifts received. House members' reports were made public Tuesday;
all but a few senators, who were granted 30-day extensions, made
their reports Wednesday.
   Because the forms are so vague, it is impossible in most cases
to discern an official's true financial status. For example, a $10
million piece of real estate may be listed on the forms as worth
``over $250,000.'' Some senators had dozens of holdings valued at
that level.
   Durenberger's troubles with the Ethics Committee are traceable
in part to his failure to disclose some transactions as required by
law. His office said Wednesday that the Florida lodging was
inadvertently left off a past form and that the loan was omitted by
someone who didn't understand the form.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., included in his income $120.80 in
royalties on a record of fiddle music he recorded several years
ago. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., reported $167 royalties
on two past books and a $5,000 advance for another he is writing
for Harvard University Press.
   Mitchell and his Republican colleague from Maine, William Cohen,
shared royalties from a book they wrote after serving on the
committee that investigated the Iran-contra scandal.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, received $5,058 in royalties for a
tape cassette in the ``Living Scriptures'' series.
   Simpson listed $40,000 he was paid for debating Kennedy in the
Mutual Radio series, ``Face Off.'' Kennedy's report did not include
his share.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee, received about $3,000 of royalties on oil and gas
investments. Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., shares with his wife a blind
trust valued at more than $250,000, which generated as much s
$50,000 income last year.
   In 1989, most senators were paid at the annual rate of $89,500;
leaders earned $99,500. Senators could keep honoraria equivalent to
40 percent of their salaries and give the rest to charity.
   House members voted to give up their honoraria starting next
year in exchange for higher government salaries, but senators
insisted on keeping those fees and taking a smaller check from the
treasury.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a first-term senator who chairs the
Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, picked up $53,000 for
speaking and gave $17,200 of it to charity. Biden, who heads the
Judiciary Committee, was paid $35,548 in honoraria and kept it all.
   This year's figures on speaking fees may not tell the whole
story. Instead of accepting checks and turning them over to
charity, some senators have begun instructing groups they address
to write the check directly to a designated charity. Dole and Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, acknowledged doing this in some cases.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., accepted a long list of gifts,
including a lamp stand (value unknown) from the president of
Malawi. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., accepted four Washington Redskins
season tickets. Freshman Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., received
several months of free lodging before his family joined him in
Washington.
   Political leanings are not forgotten in the financial reports.
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., pointedly noted a fund in which she
invests has no holdings in South Africa.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., turned over $25 of his honorarium to
``Pompous Twits Anonymous,'' a home-state charity that helps the
needy while tweaking public figures for their outlandish statements.

<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear plant has quietly
generated electricity and fed it to commercial customers for the
first time after almost two decades of regulatory delays, financial
woes and mass protests.
   The plant that became a symbol of the nation's anti-nuclear
movement in the late 1970s and 1980s generated 65 megawatts of
electricity that was fed into the New England power grid Tuesday
night.
   On Wednesday, the reactor was operating at 23 percent of
capacity, generating 216 megawatts, which plant spokesman Rob
Williams said could supply electricity to 185,000 homes.
   Williams said the power would be reduced for more testing and
brought up again to 30 percent in the next few days.
   The milestone was reached during tests to ready the
1,150-megawatt, $6.5 billion reactor for full power commercial
operation, expected this summer. Until Tuesday, low-power testing
had not generated any electricity, plant officials said.
   Ed Brown, president of plant operator New Hampshire Yankee,
called the step ``an extremely significant moment,'' while plant
opponents said nothing had changed.
   ``The notion that, 10 years behind schedule, they generate a few
kilowatts of power and that all is fine and there are no problems
is ludicrous,'' said Roy Morrison, spokesman for the Clamshell
Alliance.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon and an
environmental group filed briefs Tuesday in Washington on appeals
of Seabrook's commercial license, granted March 1. Arguments are
scheduled for Sept. 18.
   Opponents contend the seaside plant is unsafe and the evacuation
plan for the surrounding area is inadequate, especially for crowded
beaches. Plant operators say it is safe in all respects.
   Seabrook had been shut down for a month for modifications on its
non-nuclear side after problems cropped up during the start-up
process.
   No protesters greeted plant workers arriving for their shifts
Wednesday morning. Sandra Gavutis, director of Citizens Within The
Ten-Mile Radius, said the battle against Seabrook has taken on
different dimensions.
   ``The fight is by no way waning,'' said Gavutis. ``We're
definitely working in other arenas. We're working in the political
arena.''
   Gavutis said her group lobbied for the congressional
investigations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and subsequent
Seabrook-related allegations filed with the commission's inspector
general.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., on Wednesday called the NRC's actions
on Seabrook ``one slap in the face after another.''
   ``This past weekend, as the official beach season opened, miles
and miles of cars lined the traffic-filled streets surrounding the
Seabrook nuclear plant,'' Kerry said. ``You don't have to be a
nuclear physicist to imagine the problems that would arise if there
were even a minor incident during beach traffic hours.''
   Ground was broken for Seabrook in 1976, but the plant was not
finished for 10 years. The long delay led to soaring costs _
original projections called for two reactors costing less than $1
billion _ and forced its lead owner, Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire, into bankruptcy reorganization.
   Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities has won preliminary
approval to take over Public Service.

<TEXT>
   Graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy are
the best and brightest in the country, the superintendent said
Wednesday at commencement. He made only a brief mention of reports
of sexual harassment and abuse of middies.
   Graduates drew praise from Rear Adm. Virgil L. Hill Jr. and Vice
President Dan Quayle at a ceremony unmarred by the controversy that
has swirled around the campus since a female middie resigned
because she was handcuffed in a men's bathroom, taunted and
photographed.
   The brigade of midshipmen is ``literally the best and brightest
the nation has to offer,'' Hill told the 990 graduates. They are
part of ``a chain of excellence in leadership ... unmatched by any
other institution. The chain has never been stronger.''
   Five military and congressional panels are investigating
complaints that women have been sexually harassed and freshmen have
been mentally and physically abused during plebe indoctrination.
   And some professors have complained that academic standards are
declining and that they are being pressured to give passing grades
to students who have failed exams.
   The only mention of the criticism on Wednesday came from Hill,
who was warmly applauded when he mentioned telling a local
newspaper editor that he was ``just a little upset that most of the
coverage has been a little less than productive.''
   Quayle did not mention the controversy, although he devoted much
of his speech to praising midshipmen for their academic and
athletic achievements and their record of public service in
Annapolis.
   The vice president touched only briefly on national and
international affairs, telling graduates that they are beginning
their careers at a remarkable time.
   But he said that even in times of worldwide change, ``America
will need its strong global Navy to preserve our liberty and our
way of life.''
   Gwen Dreyer, a 19-year-old freshman from Encinitas, Calif.,
resigned earlier this month because of hazing she said dated to
December, when she was handcuffed to a urinal, taunted and
photographed.
   Other current and former women midshipmen have complained that
many male midshipmen resent women at the academy.
   Complaints about academic standards surfaced after a department
head was demoted because he refused to raise grades for third-year
midshipmen students in an electrical engineering course.
   Not all women at the academy agree that females are subjected to
unfair hazing.
   ``It's not a matter of gender. It's a part of life here,''
midshipman Susan Slaven said as she argued with members of the
National Organization for Women who picketed outside the graduation
ball on campus Monday night.
   ``Some people just don't belong in a military academy,'' she
said.
   Hill announced general orders Tuesday designed to end physical
and mental harassment of freshmen.
   Under the new rules, any midshipmen found guilty of physical
abuse of plebes during indoctrination could be subject to
dismissal, even if the act falls short of what is considered hazing.
   There were 96 women among the 990 Naval Academy graduates
receiving diplomas and commissions as military officers Wednesday.
   The ratio is similar to that at the two other service academies.
   At the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado, 100 women were among
the 971 cadets who received degrees Wednesday.
   There will be 89 women, including the first female brigade
commander, among about 900 graduates of the U.S. Military Academy
at West Point, N.Y., at Thursday's commencement.

<TEXT>
   A rooster strutting his stuff too early in
the day will leave his owner with little to crow about.
   Bird owners face a $500 fine under a new town ordinance intended
to put a damper on early morning clucks and crowing.
   A flock of cries of fowl play prompted the town council to
unanimously approve the ordinance earlier this month.
   People who ``knowingly or intentionally permit fowl to make
unreasonable noise after being asked to make the fowl stop'' can be
charged under the new law, council president Fred Feiock said this
week.
   ``Personally, I always liked to wake up and hear a rooster
crowing, but then I don't live next to someone who has a lot of
chickens or roosters,'' Feiock said.
   Police say they will enforce the ordinance. ``I don't know what
you're going to do though,'' said officer Ron Shrout. ``Dogs will
bark and chickens will make noise.''
   One person has been warned so far but no one has been fined,
Police Chief Lawrence Dalton said Wednesday.
   Dalton said he hasn't heard any roosters crowing, and doubts
that very many people keep them within the city limits of this town
of 3,900.
   ``I've been to two worlds' fairs and a bull fight, but this is
the first time I've heard of a chicken ordinance,'' Dalton said.
   Officials have been plagued with clucks and squawks about rowdy
roosters and chickens for more than 1{ years, Feiock said. ``At
first, it seemed more or less a joke.''
   ``Other than having their vocal chords operated on,'' Feiock
said he had no useful tips for quieting the bothersome birds.
   Feiock said officials don't want to outlaw roosters, although
they may be the prime offenders.
   ``Every chicken ought to have a rooster. My mother used to raise
chickens, and I know what it's like,'' Feiock said. ``But times are
changing, and we have to have rules to protect people.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Society of Film Critics on
Wednesday recommended a new rating for non-pornographic,
adults-only movies.
   The rating, ``A,'' is needed ``because of the alarming increase
in the application of the `X' rating to films of non-pornographic
intent,'' the society said in a letter to Jack Valenti, president
of the Motion Picture Association of America, and Richard Heffner,
head of the Ratings Board.
   The society said the rating would promote ``more equitable
access and distribution of serious, adult-themed movies.''
   The society comprises 42 critics from major, general interest
publications.
   Last week, Pedro Almodovar, producer-director of ``Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down!'' filed suit in Manhattan against the Motion Picture
Association, seeking to have the Spanish movie's rating changed
from ``X'' to ``R.''
   ``Since `X' only means a skin flick, the minute you put it on a
serious film, many theaters won't exhibit it and many newspapers
and television stations will not carry the ads and you get a
diminished audience,'' said William Kunstler, attorney for
Almodovar and the movie's distributor, Miramax Film Corp.

welcome heavy rain fell on parched northern California.
Temperatures dipped to unseasonable lows from the Great Lakes to
New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of a warm front
extended from Arkansas to Nebraska during the afternoon.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.01 inches of rain fell
at Harrison, Ark.
   A powerful storm over the Pacific Ocean spread showers into
Oregon and California, and a snow advisory was issued for higher
elevations of the Sierra Nevada range of California, north of
Yosemite National Park.
   Up to 10 inches of snow was possible at the highest elevations.
   The rain has delayed the start of fire season in northern
California, but offered little help with the state's four-year
drought.
   ``Obviously, we are pleased to have this rain, but it won't make
any difference in terms of ending the drought,'' said Don Paff,
operations chief of the Central Valley Project, the federal water
system operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
   However, thanks to the rain, the state's biggest water users _
the Central Valley irrigation districts _ won't have to draw water
from foothill and mountain reservoirs for up to two weeks,
officials said.
   Showers and thunderstorms also spread over southern Florida, and
Key West got 3.50 inches of rain in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   Elsewhere, showers continued in much of New England.
   On Tuesday, thunderstorms produced severe weather in Oklahoma,
eastern New Mexico and the northern half of Texas, spawning several
tornadoes and large hail. Heavy rain included 1.83 inches of San
Angelo, Texas; 1.72 at Kingsville, Texas; 2.73 inches at Garden
City, Kan.; 1.65 inches at Dodge City, Kan.; and 2.80 inches at
Pueblo, Colo.
   Parts of Pennsylvania got record rainfall Tuesday, including 4.5
inches in Montgomery County; 2.45 inches at Harrisburg, 2.25 inches
at Philadelphia, 1.62 inches at Scranton, and 1.35 at Williamsport.
   One death was reported Tuesday in Pennsylvania as a 6-year-old
boy was washed down Wissahicken Creek. In addition, two teen-age
girls were apparently washed away during flooding in southern Ohio.
   Temperatures dipped into the 30s and 40s early Wednesday from
the upper Mississippi Valley through the Great Lakes region and the
upper Ohio Valley to northern New England as strong northwesterly
wind ushered in cool air.
   Duluth, Minn., posted a record low of 29 degrees and Toledo,
Ohio, had a record low of 35. Duluth's low also was the coldest
reading on record there for so late in the season.
   Frost and freeze warnings were posted into Thursday morning for
the higher mountains of central Pennsylvania and for the northern
mountains and upper Greenbrier Valley of West Virginia.
   Elsewhere, temperatures also dipped into the 30s and 40s in the
Rocky Mountains.
   By contrast, the low of 81 at Brownsville, Texas, tied a
110-year-old record for the date.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 was 28 at Alamosa, Colo.

   An earthquake damaged dozens of buildings
Wednesday in the southwestern Soviet Union near the Romanian border
and was felt from the Crimea to the Baltics, officials said.
   A Soviet legislator said initial reports from the region
indicated there were deaths, although he provided no details.
   Officials reported by telephone that at least six people were
injured in the city of Kogul near the Romanian border, and that
buildings swayed in the southern part of the republics of Moldavia
and the Ukraine.
   The quake was centered in the Carpathian mountains of Romania
and registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, according to the U.S.
Geological Survey in Golden, Colo.
   ``The quake was really strong. Everything and everybody was
falling,'' said Alexander Yevchenko, deputy chairman of the
executive committee of the City Council in Izmail, an ancient
fortress city of about 100,000 people.
   ``People could not stand firmly on their feet.''
   Yevchenko estimated about 15 buildings were damaged in the city,
including the building that houses his offices.
   Damage to buildings and houses also was reported by officials in
the cities of Bolgrad, Reni, Kogul and Komrat.
   Ilmars Bishers, deputy chairman of the Council of Nationalities
of the Soviet parliament, told legislators the quake killed people
in the region, but he gave no details, the Tass news agency
reported.
   Six people were hospitalized in Kogul, in the southern part of
Moldavia, said Lt. Ivan Koltuk of the regional Interior Department.
He said buildings swayed and residents ran into the streets in
panic.
   The quake shook buildings in the capital of Moscow and Tass
reported it was felt as far north as Leningrad and the republic of
Latvia. The U.S. Embassy building was evacuated temporarily.
   ``We felt the shock and that's it,'' said a woman who answered
the telephone in Kishinev, the capital of Moldavia. The republic of
4.3 million people borders Romania.
   In the Black Sea port of Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula,
journalist Gennady Bondarenko said people felt a light shock but
there was no damage.
   ``Just the spoons clanked a bit and the dishes slid a little,''
he said in a telephone interview. Bondarenko said some frightened
residents fled their homes to stand in the streets but returned
later.
   In Moscow, 710 miles northwest of Kishinev, the quake shook the
offices of The Associated Press offices and other structures
throughout the capital.
   U.S. officials ordered the older American Embassy in Moscow
evacuated.
   ``It's an old building, and when the upper floors shook we
called around other places in town and closed the building as a
precaution to do safety checks,'' said embassy spokesman Jim
Bullock.
   ``We have people inside doing a top-to-bottom check.''
   He said the 10-story building was expected to reopen Thursday.
It is separate from the newer embassy compound. U.S. officials say
an office building in the new complex was bugged so heavily by the
Soviets it is to be torn down.
   An earthquake that struck Soviet Armenia in December 1988 killed
an estimated 25,000 people and leveled buildings in villages and
cities. That quake registered 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by a
quake as measured by the ground motion recorded by seismographs. A
quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. One of magnitude 7 is
reckoned as a major earthquake.

   Raisa Gorbachev will go Thursday from one of
Washington's most august cultural landmarks, the Library of
Congress, to one of its liveliest, the Capital Children's Museum.
   Both places were on the agenda of the Soviet president's wife
during a day that starts at the White House with a formal welcoming
ceremony and a tea with Barbara Bush and ends back there that
evening with a formal state dinner.
   There are special Soviet exhibits at both the library and the
children's museum that may have served as magnets for Mrs.
Gorbachev.
   While their husbands hold their first formal summit talks, Mrs.
Bush will be host for a private tea for Mrs. Gorbachev and the
wives of Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James Baker
III, Assistant Secretary of State Ray Seitz, Jack Matlock, the U.S.
ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, the new
Soviet ambassador to Washington.
   Industrialist Armand Hammer is hosting a ritzy reception at the
Library of Congress later for Mrs. Gorbachev and 350 guests,
including Marilyn Quayle, wife of the vice president; Washington
Post Co. Chairman Katharine Graham and Supreme Court Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor.
   Mrs. Gorbachev will get a tour of the library's Jefferson
Building from the Librarian of Congress, James Billington, then cut
the ribbon on a new exhibit, ``Living Traditions of Russian Faith:
Books and Manuscripts of the Old Believers, Fifteenth Century to
the Present.''
   Afterward, the Soviet leader's wife will pay a 25-minute visit
to the Capital Children's Museum.
   In most museums, do-not-touch is the cardinal rule. Not so in
the Children's Museum, which is teeming with hands-on, interactive
exhibits for kids of all ages and draws 250,000 visitors a year.
   Mary Abbajay, a spokeswoman for the museum, said it currently
has an exhibit of Soviet children's books by Soviet
author-illustrator Anton Kumankov, who will be on hand Thursday to
greet Mrs. Gorbachev.
   After Thursday night's state dinner at the White House, Mrs.
Gorbachev will accompany Mrs. Bush on Friday morning aboard a U.S.
Air Force jet to Massachusetts, where they will address the
graduates at Wellesley College, then take in some sights in the
Boston area.
   They will fly back to Washington by late afternoon and the
Gorbachevs will host a return dinner for the Bushes at the Soviet
Embassy Friday evening.
   Both women will accompany their husbands to Camp David, Md.,
Saturday for what the White House has billed as a day of relaxation
at the presidential mountain retreat 75 miles outside Washington.

   Here are excerpts from a toast Wednesday by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a state luncheon attended by
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

<TEXT>
   First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude for
the invitation to visit your country and for your warm hospitality.
   It is highly symbolic that as we are once again ``discovering
America,'' we begin in Canada.
   Precisely seven years ago, in May 1983, I was here with a
delegation of the USSR Supreme Soviet. I have retained very vivid
memories of that first encounter with Canada and Canadians. I am
glad to be able to greet again my old acquaintances whom I see here
in this room. I hope to meet new people.
   The USSR and Canada are natural partners in the international
community. they know each other fairly well, particularly since
there are many people in Canada with roots in Russia.
   However, in this day and age, we should always replenish and
sometimes adjust our knowledge. It is good, though, that some
things never change, such as the feeling of sympathy which, erasing
the ideological prejudices and fears of the Cold War, has enabled
us to forge new Soviet-Canadian relations. They are gaining
momentum in the spirit of the coming new age. Over the past seven
years, Soviet-Canadian political dialogue has also emerged as the
leading instrument in our interaction.
   At a time of turbulent change and of a breakdown of established
views and stereotypes, contacts and mutual understanding between
states acquire special value, particularly between those that have
special responsibilities to the world community.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Today, at a watershed in world history and politics, the
friendly feelings and creative aspirations of our two peoples can
serve as the northern pillar of the bridge of confidence and
security between the East and the West, of new dramatic
international relations which mankind will take with it into the
21st century.
   I can say that the challence of our time has not taken the
Soviet Union and Canada by surprise. Indeed, in their relations
with each other and with the rest of the world they have shown
foresight. In times of tensions they did not exacerbate the
situation but tried to use any opportunity to improve it.
   We and you were able to cooperate at the dawn of the Helsinki
process. And now we will be drawing the final line under the
horrible war of tyranny and darkness. We are against looking back
to the past all the time; however. Without its lessons it is
impossible to bring closer a free and secure future, a future in
which there is no room for hatred and revanchism, a future built on
voluntary and humane principles. We regard the Soviet-Canadian
interaction as an integral and vital support structure of a future
common european home.

   The Arctic, the roof of the world and a source of life on our
planet, has been and remains an area of special cooperation between
our two countries, neighbors across the arctic ocean. at last, but,
of course, not least, we work together to curb the arms race and
participate in the process of disarmament.
   These are the main parameters in the trajectory of
Soviet-Canadian dialogue.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Let me make a special point on Soviet-Canadian trade and
economic relations. It should be emphasized that neither the Soviet
Union nor Canada have ever tried to politicize them or questioned
the need to develop them on the basis of equality and mutual
advantage. The scope and consistency of our cooperation in this
area and the solid legal groundwork on which it is built hold out
the hope that, as we radicalize the economic reform in the USSR,
these relations will grow even more dynamic with an understanding
of the special aspects and difficulties of the period of transition
to a new system in the Soviet Union.
   We are pleased to note the strong support that the Canadian
government has been giving to the businesses that want to cooperate
with the Soviet Union and to their initiatives that help integrate
our economy in the world economic system. We say very clearly that
what we want is not western ``help'' but cooperation on a mutually
advantageous basis in shaping a new economy for our country, which
is a vast and rich part of the world's potential. Reintegrating it
fully in the world economic context is, we believe, necessary and
advantageous to all. At the same time, economic interdependence
lends long-term stability to bilateral and multilateral interaction.
   In this context, we would hope that the emergence of new, modern
types of cooperation, the establishment of joint ventures will be a
continuous process.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I told the Prime Minister in Moscow that we reject economic
isolation and are ready to depend on other countries, to the
extent, or course, that they are prepared to depend on us. I don't
think Canada has any reason to fear such interdependence. It is a
must in our time, in this new age that links all mankind in a
common destiny

   An earthquake that was felt from
Istanbul to Moscow hit Romania hard Wednesday, killing eight
people, hurting 296 and badly damaging buildings in Bucharest and
cities across much of Romania, police said.
   Large chunks of concrete and plaster fell from buildings onto
sidewalks and streets, killing and injuring people.
   Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert of Glasgow, Scotland, staying in an
apartment in a 10-story building in Bucharest, said: ``The walls of
the bedroom crumbled with plaster falling. Stuff came flying off
shelves and all the plaster came off the ceilings. Outside there's
a massive crack in the building.''
   People were hurt jumping from windows or balconies in this
capital city of 2.2 million. Thousands of Bucharest residents fled
into streets as buildings swayed and cracked.
   Shop assistant Petruta Lungu was killed in Bucharest when hit by
a collapsing balcony as she ran outside, police said.
   The quake was centered 100 miles north of Bucharest, in the
wooded Vrancea range of the Carpathian mountains, and registered
6.5 on the Richter scale, the U.S. Geological Survey said in
Golden, Colo.
   The temblor also shook the Soviet Union, Hungary, Greece, Turkey
and Bulgaria, but of those only the Soviet Union reported
casualties. It said at least six people were hurt in the city of
Kogul.
   Soviet legislator Ilmars Bishers said initial reports Wednesday
indicated there were deaths, but he gave no details.
   The quake hit here at 1:40 p.m. (6:40 a.m. EDT) and rumbled
across the Carpathians, which run through eastern Romania, the
western border of the Soviet Union and southwest Poland.
   A communique from Romania's General Inspectorate of Police said
two people died in Bucharest, two in the Danube River port of
Braila, and one each in eastern Buzau, southeastern Ialomita,
central Brasov and nearby Prahova County.
   It said 45 of the 296 people hurt were in critical condition. In
Bucharest alone, 102 people were hurt, 35 critically, it reported.
   Doina Stoica, 22, a student, said: ``I was scared. I was in a
book shop and the first thought was to get my mom and get out on
the street.''
   French journalist Michel Desprats, 24, noticed chandeliers
swaying in the marble lobby of the Bucuresti Hotel _ ``In panic, I
followed all the people out of the hotel and people were all
shouting and crying.''
   The ceiling collapsed at a big electrical steel plant in
Calarasi County in southern Romania, the state news agency Rompres
reported.
   In Moscow, Soviet officials said people from the Crimea to the
Baltics felt the quake and dozens of buildings were damaged in the
southwestern part of the country.
   In Ottawa, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was
told several shocks shook Moldavia and Armenia but ``no
devastation, no destruction.'' He said he saw no reason to break
off his trip to return home, as he did in December 1988, when a
quake killed an estimated 25,000 people in Armenia. The 1988 quake
prompted him to cut short travel plans and fly directly home from
New York.
   Buildings shook in Moscow, 1,000 miles east of Bucharest,
including the offices of The Associated Press. The 10-story U.S.
Embassy building was evacuated temporarily.
   Six people were hospitalized in Kogul, Moldavia, Lt. Ivan Koltuk
of the regional Interior Department said. He said buildings swayed
and residents ran in panic into the streets.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported the quake was felt as far
north as Leningrad and the Baltic republic of Latvia.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by a
quake as measured by the ground motion recorded by seismographs. A
quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. One of magnitude 7 is
reckoned as a major earthquake.
   The Romanian General Inspectorate's communique reported injuries
from the counties of Dolj, Prahova, Buzau, Ialomita, Galati,
Braila, Constanta, Vaslui, Bacau and Vrancea.
   Bulgaria's state BTA news agency said the temblor was felt
nationwide there, but there was minor damage only in Silistra town,
bordering Romania. A nuclear power plant in Kozlodoui on the Danube
was closed.
   The quake knocked out telephone lines in the Soviet Union and
shook buildings in Russia, the Ukraine and Moldavia.
   This was the third major earthquake in Romania since 1977. The
other two were also centered in the Vrancea range. The most
serious, on March 4, 1977, killed 1,500 people.

<HEAD>State Promises Times Beach Pollutant Incinerator is Temporary</HEAD>

   A state official promised Wednesday that a
proposed toxic waste incinerator at the dioxin-contaminated and
abandoned town of Times Beach would not become a permanent fixture.
   Tracy Mehan, head of the state Department of Natural Resources,
outlined a plan he said provided multiple safeguards to ensure that
the proposed incinerator would be used only to burn dioxin-tainted
soil from Times Beach and 26 other sites in eastern Missouri.
   ``I am committing to the citizens of St. Louis County here and
now that the Department of Natural Resources will not allow Times
Beach to become the dioxin dumping ground of the nation,'' Mehan
said at a news conference.
   But some Times Beach neighbors who have opposed the incinerator
said Mehan's pledge did nothing to ease their fears.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it means absolutely nothing. It's
just another promise that we don't believe,'' said Eureka Mayor
Otis Nelson.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency plans to build a
huge incinerator at Times Beach, about 20 miles southwest of St.
Louis, to burn all the soil that was contaminated there and at the
other sites in the 1970s by dioxin-tainted oil sprayed to control
road dust.
   After the highly toxic chemical was detected, the federal
government bought out residents seven years ago and the town was
abandoned.
   Nelson and other opponents fear that once the incinerator is
built, officials could decide to use it to burn toxic wastes from
across the country. They also oppose it because it is to be built
alongside the Meramec River and would be vulnerable to flooding.
   The EPA says the incinerator would be protected from flooding by
a levee.
   ``What if they have a malfunction and pump a lot of toxic,
dangerous runoffs or whatever into the Meramec? Then what are they
going to say? `Whoops, we made a mistake?''' Nelson said.
   One of the points in Mehan's plan was a guarantee that the
department would not issue permits for the Times Beach facility
that allowed any other waste to be brought in.
   The EPA has said the entire cleanup would cost about $118
million and could take up to 10 years.

<TEXT>
   Government soldiers on Wednesday
stormed a U.N. compound where members of rival tribes had taken
shelter, killing a U.N. security guard, wounding two people and
abducting at least 30, witnesses said.
   Villagers took reporters to four bodies dumped a few miles
outside Monrovia and said they were victims of the attack.
   Civilians in the capital were outraged at the attack, with
hundreds of people booing and hissing at President Samuel Doe as he
tried to calm people several hours later.
   ``Kill us! Kill us!'' the crowd screamed at young soldiers
guarding Doe, whose government is fighting for its survival after
guerrillas reached within 30 miles of the capital.
   Doe said soldiers were not acting on his orders when they
attacked the compound early Wednesday, killing the U.N. security
guard and abducting about 30 men.
   ``They are doing it on their own and I am going to deal with
them drastically,'' he promised.
   A government statement promised the soldiers would be arrested
within 24 hours and said troops found harassing civilians would be
executed.
   Villagers took reporters to four bodies lined up in the grass a
few miles outside Monrovia alongside the road from the capital to
the main international airport. Witnesses said the four were
abducted from the U.N. compound.
   There have been repeated charges that Doe's soldiers have killed
civilians from the Gio and Mano tribes, which they accuse of
supporting the rebels. In the past weeks, several bodies of
beheaded Mano and Gio men were discovered near the capital.
   There are also reports that the rebels have been targeting
members of Doe's small tribe, the Krahn, and the Mandingo, a tribe
they say supports the Krahns and exploits other tribes.
   Guerrillas from the National Patriotic Front, led by a former
Doe aide, Charles Taylor, invades in December from the Ivory Coast
in an attempt to oust Doe, whom they accuse of corruption and
nepotism. Taylor has said he would maintain strong U.S. ties if his
forces oust Doe.
   Frightened Liberian families have packed their belongings and
fled the capital amid rumors that rebels are closing in. Senior
government officials, including several Cabinet ministers, are
apparently deserting Doe.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, officials announced they were
evacuating all 57 U.N. personnel from Liberia and had lodged a
protest with the Foreign Ministry over the attack.
   U.N. officials said they were trying to find churches to take in
the nearly 1,000 people who have sought refuge at their facilities.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said about eight soldiers
wearing masks forced their way into the U.N. compound in Monrovia.
``They bayoneted a guard and shot two others _ killing one and
wounding the other,'' he said.
   The soldiers then began beating men, women and children and
forced as many as 40 people into army vehicles before driving off,
he said.
   Local newspapers on Wednesday published government appeals
asking people to ``stop listening to rumors, stop panicking and go
about your businesses.''
   Ghana Airways, the main commercial air link to Liberia, said on
Wednesday it was cancelling flights to the country. The statement
came a day after rebels ambushed two truckloads of troops a few
miles from Robertsfield International Airport, 21 miles from
Monrovia.
   Diplomats said Doe, who took power in a bloody 1980 coup, fears
for his safety and no longer sleeps in the same place each night.
The diplomats also said Doe's presidential jet and an army Cessna
plane are being kept ready at an airfield in the capital.
   According to news reports and Western officials several
high-ranking government officials have deserted Doe and the
portfolios of foreign affairs, internal affairs and information are
being handled by acting ministers.

   President Bush met with top advisers and
consulted by phone with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Wednesday as he made last-minute preparations for his summit with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``He's upbeat, he's confident, he knows what he wants to talk to
Gorbachev about,'' said Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Bush met with Quayle and senior advisers in a final session to
run down the range of issues expected to come up at the four-day
summit that begins Thursday.
   The president did not watch on television as Gorbachev and
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney talked at an Ottawa news
conference about Germany's future, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   At the news conference, Gorbachev gave sometimes testy responses
to questions on Soviet policy on German reunification and Lithuania.
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush talked with Kohl on German unity and
other summit issues, Fitzwater said, and he had talked the day
before to Mulroney.
   On the eve of his second summit with Gorbachev, Bush, in
contrast to his Soviet counterpart, was completely out of public
view.
   Concluding a short stay in Canada, Gorbachev was highly visible,
breaking with his formal schedule at one point to stroll toward
Ottawa's Parliament Hill for discussions with Mulroney.
   Fitzwater said Bush brings to his meetings with Gorbachev ``the
understandings and insights of many allied leaders.'' Bush earlier
had consulted with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
French President Francois Mitterrand, the spokesman told reporters.
   Fitzwater said that Kohl and Mulroney initiated the respective
calls.
   Bush's mood on the eve of the summit was ``one of anticipation
and confidence that democratic values are sustaining positive
change in the world order,'' Fitzwater said. He said Bush looked
forward to ``frank, penetrating discussions.''
   ``The president approaches this summit as a very serious meeting
in which very specific and meaningful agreements will be
achieved,'' Fitzwater said.
   It was the second consecutive day that Bush remained out of
sight _ and behind closed doors _ meeting with senior advisors and
poring over summit briefing books.
   Within sight of Bush's Oval Office windows, a military band
rehearsed on the South Lawn and workers put the finishing touches
on scaffolding and a three-tier viewing stand for Thursday's
official morning welcoming ceremonies.
   Enormous U.S. and Soviet flags were draped over the entrance to
the Old Executive Office Building next door and smaller flags
decorated lamp posts surrounding the White House complex.
   Across the street, a rock band made up of Soviet youths, bearing
T-shirts declaring ``Rock Not Rockets,'' played in Lafayette Park _
sparsely populated on Wednesday but expected to be crammed with
demonstrators on Thursday.
   Bush had no plans to leave the White House, nor was he expected
to speak to Gorbachev _ arriving in Washington in early evening
after his stopover in Canada _ before Thursday's arrival ceremony,
Fitzwater said.
   However, since both leaders have in the past demonstrated a
degree of unpredictability, Fitzwater declined to be pinned down
when asked to say for certain that Bush would not contact Gorbachev
on Wednesday night.
   ``I don't rule anything out,'' the spokesman said.
   Bush attended two briefings from advisors in the morning _ one
dealing with economic and trade issues and the second with arms
control.
   In the afternoon, he held a final briefing session ``with key
advisors to consider overview questions, the general tone and
texture of the summit,'' Fitzwater said.
   While not detailing what Bush and Kohl talked about in their
Wednesday morning phone call, Fitzwater said the president does not
plan to unveil any new proposal at the summit to limit the military
forces of a unified Germany.
   He said that Bush still shares Kohl's views that a reunified
Germany should be a full member of NATO. ``We are opposed to any
proposal which would single out Germany for special limits,''
Fitzwater said.
   At the same time, Fitzwater said, the issue of force levels
within Germany was a proper subject for ``follow-on conventional
arms control negotiations'' once a treaty to reduce troops and
tanks throughout Europe is reached.
   ``The issue of the size of the (German army) is of obvious
concern to the Soviets. We understand that,'' Fitzwater said.
However, he added that it was not an issue that could be resolved
at this week's summit.
   Fitzwater said Germany unity would likely be discussed in
greater depth at the more-relaxed talks expected to take place on
Saturday between Bush and Gorbachev at the U.S. presidential
retreat at Camp David, Md.
   As it stood Wednesday, Bush and Gorbachev at their White House
sessions on Thursday and Friday planned to deal primarily with arms
control, conventional arms, chemical weapons, trade and other
issues that could lead to ``various specific agreements,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``There are a lot of floating parts at this moment,'' the White
House spokesman said. ``And trying to put order in that process is
really what Saturday's discussions are all about.''

   President Bush will cut no deal with Mikhail
S. Gorbachev at this week's summit to limit German troops, but he
is prepared to discuss a formula that might eventually scale down
those forces along with the Red Army, U.S. officials said Wednesday.
   The issue of German unification and its impact on arms control
loomed as the potential spoiler at the four-day summit, and
Gorbachev signaled his determination to press the matter before
leaving Canada for Washington.
   ``There are different scenarios that might not be exactly what
the West would propose,'' he told reporters before leaving Ottawa.
``There should be no attempt to dictate a solution.''
   Gorbachev's reservations about the more powerful nation that
will emerge from the merger of East Germany with West Germany have
contributed to a slowdown in negotiations to cut U.S. and Soviet
troops, tanks, aircraft, helicopters and other non-nuclear weapons
in Europe.
   American and Soviet negotiators held a fourth day of pre-summit
talks at the State Department to try to overcome the slump and to
expand on the kinds of long-range nuclear weapons to be reduced in
another treaty.
   They met for an hour and a half in the morning and did not
resume in the afternoon. ``Everybody would like to see things
progress, but there isn't a lot of progress,'' a U.S. official
said. ``They are waiting for the rest of the team.''
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze arranged to meet separately
Friday at the White House while Bush and Gorbachev hold their first
session.
   In 11th-hour drive to forge agreements, the Kremlin assigned
Col. Gen. Labronislav Omelichev, first deputy on the Soviet defense
ministry's general staff, to the talks. There was no immediate word
of his arrival from Moscow.
   The move was viewed by U.S. officials as a positive step.
Omelichev, a specialist on strategic nuclear weapons, was
considered instrumental in the headway the two superpowers made in
negotiations here in February.
   Before leaving Ottawa for the summit in Washington, Gorbachev
referred to U.S. insistence on full NATO membership for a more
powerful German neighbor, saying, ``I would like us to find a new
melody.''
   Bush administration officials here said the president was
determined to have a successful meeting with Gorbachev and to try
to ease the Soviet leader's concerns without backing away from
having Germany in the Western alliance.
   They said any settlement would require the participation and
consent of West Germany and the other partners in the 16-nation
military group.
   ``We are opposed to any proposal which would single out Germany
for special limits,'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,
said.
   However, Bush and Gorbachev will discuss the ``general
question'' of German unification and ``we want to hear their
concerns and interests,'' Fitzwater said.
   The formula other U.S. officials said Bush was ready to take up
with Gorbachev involved a tradeoff, to be negotiated by NATO and
the Warsaw Pact in Vienna after a treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
troops and non-nuclear forces in Europe is finished.
   The Western allies would consider imposing limitations on the
size of the German army, but in exchange the Soviets would have to
agree to cut down the Red Army proportionally within the Soviet
Union, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   And, in a concession to Gorbachev, who finds the buffer provided
by the Warsaw Pact crumbling, NATO troops would keep out of what is
now East Germany while some Red Army troops could stay there for
``a transitional period,'' the official said.
   Spokesman Fitzwater, hinting at the arrangement, said Bush was
prepared to explore ``mutually acceptable options and positions.''
He stressed there would be no bargaining, though, over unifying
Germany.
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond G.H. Seitz told reporters
that the United States wants rapid unification in ``an orderly
fashion'' and with the new Germany enjoying the privileges and
responsibilities of all other nations in Europe.
   ``That doesn't seem to be the Soviet approach,'' he said.
   Seitz said the Soviets have ``a lot of legitimate concern''
which the United States and its allies must address ``but not at
the cost of a fully sovereign Germany.''
   As for the arms talks, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State
Department spokeswoman, said, ``There are still a lot of questions
to be answered. ... I can tell you there has been some progress,
but there has not been a definite resolution.''
   The current negotiations got a pre-summit boost on Tuesday with
an agreement on how to define tanks and armored personnel carriers.
This will help in carrying out cutbacks in U.S. and Soviet arsenals
in Europe and also in verifying compliance with an eventual arms
reduction treaty.
   But U.S. officials, disclosing Omelichev's imminent arrival,
said there was no breakthrough on a half-dozen strategic nuclear
weapons issues. Nor, he said, have the negotiators settled on a
definition of combat aircraft, the key sticking point in the
conventional arms arena, despite the presence at the table of the
top Soviet negotiator, Oleg A. Grinevsky.
   There is ample agreement on enough strategic weapons reductions
to enable Bush and Gorbachev to issue a declaration during the
summit pledging to reduce their arsenals of nuclear missiles,
bombers and submarines by 30 to 35 percent.

<HEAD>Barry, Feds in Plea Bargain Talks, Source Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary plea bargaining has begun between
Mayor Marion Barry's attorney and federal prosecutors over the
mayor's drug and perjury case, a source familiar with the mayor's
legal situation said Wednesday.
   The source, a long-time confidant of Barry's who spoke only on
condition of anonymity, said U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens and
defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy held their first discussion last
week.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to all charges and lawyers on both
sides of the case have consistently denied any plea bargain
discussions were taking place
   The mayor is scheduled to stand trial on 14 charges beginning
June 4.
   In an interview published in Wednesday's editions of The
Washington Post, Barry acknowledged smoking crack cocaine just
prior to his Jan. 18 arrest at a downtown Washington hotel in an
FBI sting operation.
   But he said federal authorities had tried to kill him by
allowing him access to potent drugs. He also dismissed earlier
reports that he was considering a plea bargain.
   ``I think the prosecutors know that in this town all it takes is
one juror saying, `I'm not going to convict Marion Barry. I don't
care what you say,''' Barry told the newspaper.
   However, Barry added, ``I'm not saying that never in life that
one doesn't re-examine one's position.'' Later, he added: ``My ego
is not such that I'm going to go crazy if I'm not the mayor.''
   The source who disclosed the discussions between Mundy and
Stephens said, ``These are preliminary talks, sort of a feeling-out
process. But they're still talking.''
   ``Of course, these are plea bargain discussions,'' the source
added.
   The source said Stephens and Mundy have had at least four
conversations since last Friday, when U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson denied Mundy's motion to dismiss the case.
   ``They're still talking, but they are a long way off,'' the
source said. ``They are not making a great deal of progress, but it
would be wrong to say they cannot ultimately reach a settlement.''
   Barry, who faces three felony counts of lying to a grand jury
about his alleged drug use, would be barred from office and
prohibited from running for re-election if convicted of any of
those charges.
   ``He would not plead to that,'' the source said. ``The thinking
is, he would rather take his chances in court.''
   The 54-year-old mayor also faces 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges and one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge.
   Neither Mundy nor Stephens could immediately be reached for
comment. Several telephone calls to each were not returned.
   Barry has not publicly revealed his political plans but has been
making a series of campaign-style appearances around the city in
recent weeks. Anita Bonds, Barry's campaign manager, said in a
statement Tuesday that her staff is ``very hopeful that we will
have a candidate for mayor in Mayor Marion Barry later this
season.''
   Bonds told The Associated Press that she intends to pick up
candidate petitions from the city's Board of Elections later this
week. Such a move would mark Barry's first formal step toward a
candidacy.

   Space shuttle Columbia will not take
off until next week at the earliest after a fuel leak scrubbed
Wednesday's launch, NASA officials said.
   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off at 12:38 a.m. EDT with a
$150 million observatory called Astro. But it was called off about
six hours before launch time when hydrogen began leaking while
Columbia's external fuel tank was being loaded.
   Workers were expected to enter Columbia's rear engine
compartment early Thursday to search for the leak and assess the
problem. But first all the hydrogen must be vented from the
external tank and the system must be purged with non-flammable
helium.
   ``It's hard to believe at the rate (of) leak we've seen that we
missed it,'' said Bascom Murrah, a NASA official in charge of
pre-launch operations for Columbia. ``Something gave. But it's a
guessing game until we get in there.''
   It was the first time a shuttle launch had been scrubbed during
fueling. More than a half-million gallons of super-cold liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen were being pumped into Columbia's
external tank.
   ``The system was tight going into launch count, and it passed
all of our standard leak tests. We felt good about it,'' said NASA
launch director Bob Sieck. ``The problem did not manifest itself
until we saw cold cryogenic temperatures. Of course, it is our hope
that it is still there under ambient conditions when we go into our
troubleshooting.''
   Columbia's seven astronauts returned to their home base at
Johnson Space Center in Houston on Wednesday. They planned to
practice liftoffs and landings in a shuttle mission simulator while
awaiting a new launch date.
   Engineers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spent hours opening and closing valves and watching a network of
sensors before finding the general area of the leaks late Tuesday.
   A 17-inch valve in a pipe that carries fuel from the external
tank to the shuttle's main engines was believed to have a leak the
size of a pinhole, Sieck said.
   Sieck said hydrogen leaked for fewer than five minutes before
the fueling was halted. Readings showed hydrogen inside the aft end
of Columbia as well as outside the orbiter.
   Hydrogen also leaked from equipment on the launch platform, but
that was minor and would not have prevented NASA from proceeding
with the launch, Murrah said.
   If the problem is ``something obvious that we can repair on the
pad, then we'll do that and fly,'' Murrah said.
   Sieck said given those circumstances, the middle of next week
would be the earliest another launch could be attempted.
   A worse-case scenario would mean rolling Columbia back to its
hangar, which likely would mean a delay of about a month, Murrah
said.
   ``There is still maybe some unknown that we can check or test
every aspect of the (valve) between the orbiter and the external
tank in the current configuration at that pad,'' Sieck said.
   ``However, it's a technical problem and with technical problems
we can find them. We will find it and we will fix it and we will
get on with (the mission). There's just a schedule uncertainty as
to when we'll be there.''
   In either case, NASA plans to open Columbia's payload bay on
Friday and replenish the argon supply of Astro's X-ray telescope,
Sieck said. The telescope constantly needs argon so its instruments
remain cold. The job is expected to take more than two days but
could be done in conjunction with other work.
   NASA said Wednesday it would proceed as planned with Friday's
scheduled launch of a German X-ray observatory known as Rosat. The
observatory will be boosted into orbit by an unmanned Delta rocket.
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day mission with Astro will be the 36th
shuttle flight and the first one in five years devoted entirely to
scientific research. The observatory's four telescopes will examine
ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from extremely hot stars and
galaxies. Such radiation is invisible from the ground.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said
Wednesday the West's insistence on keeping a united Germany in NATO
sounds ``like an old record,'' and indicated he would offer new
ideas to break the impasse.
   ``We do have some leeway to find an accommodation. There are
different scenarios that might not be exactly what the West would
propose,'' he told reporters before he flew to Washington for his
summit with President Bush.
   Western leaders ``are trying to dictate to a certain degree,''
Gorbachev said. ``There should be no attempt to dictate a
solution.''
   Gorbachev said he and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney spent ``a
considerable part of our time'' discussing German unification, but
said they had not resolved a disagreement over whether a united
Germany could belong to NATO.
   ``In spite of all that, I think we can say we had an exchange
which was positive and very constructive,'' he said. ``It was a
short visit but a very intense visit.''
   Mulroney, like Bush and the other western allies, supports
keeping Germany within NATO. West Germany currently belongs to the
western military alliance; East Germany belongs to the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   The Soviet Union has suggested that a united Germany could
belong to both military alliances, or a new security system, but
has opposed suggestions that it belong only to NATO.
   Gorbachev has said failure to somehow neutralize Germany or
prevent it from ever again threatening the Soviet Union could stall
the Soviet military withdrawal from Eastern Europe.
   ``We have to find a course of action that will support, rather
than do damage to, those very important changes that are happening
in Europe and in the world,'' he said. ``It has to be a course of
action that we find together.
   ``I have not yet heard any alternative from the West. It seems
that it is just like an old record that keeps playing the same
notes again and again. I would like us to ... find a new melody.''
   At an airport news conference before leaving for Washington,
Gorbachev said that the nations discussing German unification must
carefully consider the consequences, as well as the views and
interests of all sides.
   ``This is not just a 30-second basketball match,'' he said.
``You have to ask: What does the other side want? Maybe we have to
take a time out.''
   In addition, he said, German leaders have much work to do before
achieving unification.
   ``They have to get rid of euphoria and get down to business
because they have enough problems,'' he said.
   Gorbachev also spoke of a ``changing Europe, changing for the
better. Instead of confrontation, we are getting to know each other
better. We are even getting to trust each other.''
   Mulroney was conciliatory, saying he believes there has been an
``inadvertent insensitivity to the legitimate security
apprehensions of the Soviet Union.''
   He told reporters that no country suffered more than the Soviet
Union in World War II.
   Mulroney urged the United States and the Soviet Union to pursue
a compromise course to avoid dealing ``a lethal blow'' to the
progress that has been made in East-West relations.
   Gorbachev also answered questions about his problems with the
three secessionist Baltic republics. He noted there has been
``pressure to use very hard measures to resolve this question.''
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were forcibly annexed in 1940 and
have been seeking to secede from the Soviet Union. Gorbachev
imposed economic sanctions against Lithuania after it declared
independence on March 11.
   He became very animated when he discussed Lithuania's
declaration, which he said was done in a ``dishonest, thief-like
manner'' on the eve of an important meeting of the Soviet
Parliament. And he said those Lithuanians seeking immediate
independence are ``adventurists.''
   Gorbachev has said the republics can only win their independence
by following the Soviet Constitution, which requires the republics
to get the approval of Soviet lawmakers.
   On a conciliatory note, he said ``our federation does require
some fundamental changes'' to give republics greater sovereignty
and the ability to preserve their languages and cultures.
   ``I think this is a progressive movement, and I think this
should be reflected in modern politics,'' he said. But he warned
that fears are raised when separatism ``rears its head.''
   Canada announced during the visit it will extend a $500 million
line of credit to the Soviet Union over the next two years. The aid
is about $425 million in U.S. dollars.
   Earlier, after a wreath-laying ceremony at a war memorial,
Gorbachev and Mulroney surprised their escorts by walking part of
the short distance to Parliament Hill to continue their talks.
   As they strolled toward the ornate stone Parliament building,
they smiled and occasionally paused to speak to the crowd that
gathered behind police barriers.
   They then got in their cars to drive the final stretch and
avoided an encounter with a group of several hundred demonstrators
who protested Gorbachev's refusal to grant independence to the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

   Scores of super-spelling youngsters,
conquering such words as ``clepsydra'' and ``probouleutic,''
breezed through the early rounds Wednesday of the 63rd annual
National Spelling Bee.
   About two-thirds of the 226 competitor who had begun the two-day
spelling contest in a hotel ballroom remained in contention after
the first three rounds. Seventy-one of the spellers dropped out,
victims of such words as ``upeygan,'' ``ipsedixitism'' and
``quercitron'' in the annual contest.
   The opening rounds moved quickly as the competitors were asked
to spell words from a master list of 1,000 selected by a panel of
researchers. The words in the first three rounds were among more
than 2,000 words provided to competitors for study.
   Organizers of the competition said the spellers, who are 10 to
14 years old, will find it tougher in the next rounds when words
will be used that have not been on the study list. ``There will be
a dramatic change,'' said Alex Cameron, the pronouncer in the
competition.
   In Wednesday's competition, eight spellers were eliminated in
the first round. The tougher second round took 33 additional
contestants, including Erika Harrell, 9, the youngest competitor.
Erika, a fourth grader from Muncie, Ind., stumbled on
``soliterraneous'' _ forgetting the second ``r.''
   Another 30 contestants dropped out in the third round.
   The youngsters sat on rows of chairs on a stage and, one by one,
walked to the microphone to be challenged. The winner of the bee,
which concludes Thursday, will win $5,000, a trophy cup and special
prizes from Encyclopaedia Britannica.
   ``Waiting for your number to come around'' is the hardest, said
Melissa Lake, 14, an eighth grader from Denver, between rounds. She
had just spelled correctly ``erubescent''.
   Nathan Erb, 13, an eighth grader from Lapeer, Mich., agreed,
saying that ``keeping yourself awake'' between words was also a
challenge. The first two words thrown at him were not much of a
challenge, however. He handled both ``casserole'' and then
``belomancy.''
   Margaret Rhine, 10, a fifth grader from Lexington, S.C., and one
of the younger competitors, had not competed before this year. But
she has had a lot of advice from her brother, who made it to the
nationals twice, each time being eliminated in the fourth round.
   ``I got two relatively easy (words),'' Margaret said with some
relief. She advanced through the second round by spelling
``eviternity.''
   Here are a few other words that contestants spelled correctly in
the early rounds: clepsydra, probouleutic, weddellite, chasmophyte,
burisiculate, gastriloquist, pityriasis and leggieramente.
   Last year 903 words were spelled before Scott Isaacs, 14, of
Englewood Colo., emerged as champion.
   The competition, which began in 1925, is sponsored by Scripps
Howard Newspapers and 208 other daily, weekly and Sunday newspapers
in 47 states.
   This year one contestant is making a fourth appearance in the
national competition; five others were competing for a third time,
and 35 were at the event for a second time.
   To get to the national competition, the 127 girls and 99 boys
had competed against nearly 9 million other students at the local
level.

   A woman told police she tried to set fire
to a Planned Parenthood Center because she was infuriated by a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that protesters could not block abortion
clinics.
   Shari D. DiNicola, 24, was arrested Monday and charged with two
counts of arson and one count of attempted arson. She pleaded
innocent Tuesday and was released. City Court Judge Langston C.
McKinney ordered her not to go near Planned Parenthood; its
director or his home.
   DiNicola said made the first of three attempts to burn down
Planned Parenthood's Syracuse clinic on May 23, two days after the
Supreme Court decision.
   In a statement to police after her arrest, she said the high
court's decision ``made me furious.''
   ``My intentions in doing these acts were not to hurt anybody. I
am opposed to abortions and my objective was to burn the building
down to put Planned Parenthood out of business,'' DiNicola said.
   DiNicola's relatives said she is receiving psychiatric
counseling. Her lawyer, Gaetano Colozzi, said he might raise her
mental condition as a reason for suppressing her statement in court.
   On May 21, the Supreme Court upheld a ban on demonstrations at
New York City area abortion clinics by the group, Operation Rescue.
A week earlier, the court left intact a ban on Operation Rescue
blockades in Atlanta.
   DiNicola was arrested early Monday after police said a videotape
camera they set up caught her trying to set a fire at the clinic.
DiNicola also admitted in her statement to two other arson attempts
at the center.
   None of the fires caused any serious damage.
   Planned Parenthood officials had blamed the fires on Operation
Rescue. Sixty-four Operation Rescue protesters have been arrested
at the clinic since March 1989.
   DiNicola and her relatives said she has never been a member of
the group.

   Baker: Mr. President, Mrs. Gorbachev, I am delighted to welcome
you to Washington on behalf of the president and Mrs. Bush and on
behalf as well of the American people. Mr. President, the eyes of
the world are on you, and they are on President Bush. Together, our
nations have the responsibility to leave behind not only the Cold
War but also the conflicts that preceded it.
   To do that, we must see a Germany unified and Europe reconciled.
We must reduce the danger of war by controlling nuclear, chemical
and conventional arms and by resolving regional conflicts. And of
course we want to see continued movement toward democracy and
openness in the Soviet Union.
   Mr. President, the world has looked forward since last winter to
this visit and to the promise that this visit holds. So together
this week, let us seek to fulfill that promise.

   Gorbachev: Thank you, Mr. Secretary of State for your words of
welcome and hospitality. In these first minutes of our visit to
America I wish to convey on behalf of the people of the U.S.S.R.
our best wishes to the people of the United States. We are looking
forward to important talks with President George Bush. A lot will
depend on their results in determining how things will work out,
not only between you Americans and us, but also on a larger scale.
   We shall also have meetings with other political leaders, public
figures and, I hope, with other Americans of various positions and
walks of life. This summit stands out in its importance, first of
all, for the promise it holds as the first major step to reduce
strategic nuclear arms. Both sides have worked painstakingly
together to prepare it.
   This meeting is also special because this is the first time that
the president of the United States and I will have enough time to
reflect on and discuss, not only in a formal setting but also in
more informal surroundings, one on one, all questions either of us
might have that fall within our responsibility.
   I would like once again to wish peace and well being to every
American home. Thank you.

   A Chinese group won the right Wednesday to
use a Buffalo park to commemorate last year's Tiananmen Square
crackdown, but was promptly warned not to expect any help from City
Hall.
   The group, June 4 Memorial Fund, persuaded a judge to block
enforcement of a city ordinance that forbids ``any speech, oration
or harangue'' in a city park without written permission from the
parks commissioner. The judge said the ordinance was probably
unconstitutional.
   ``In the absence of narrowly drawn reasons and definite
standards for officials to follow, the ordinance must be invalid,''
said state Supreme Court Justice Leo J. Fallon.
   Parks Commissioner Stanley Buczkowski rejected the group's bid
to use Delaware Park, Buffalo's major park, this Sunday, but
offered instead to close a downtown square to traffic so the
ceremony could be held there instead.
   Russell Sciandra, the city's lawyer, said he would not recommend
an appeal, but warned the group it can expect no special services
from the city.
   ``We were attempting to assist them by creating special
arrangements for them in terms of police, fire, streets,
sanitation, et cetera,'' Sciandra said. ``They don't feel they need
it. If they have the unfettered right to use the park, so be it.''
   Eva Koepsell, the group's secretary, said she found the city's
attitude ``appalling.''
   ``Every other major city in the United States is sponsoring a
ceremony to remember the students who died'' in the June 4 military
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, she said.
   Wei-Hsung Lin, the group's president, said the city's cold
shoulder would force organizers to look elsewhere for a stage and
electricity, but he said the experience was instructive.
   ``It taught me a lot about the constitutional rights of freedom
of speech and freedom of assembly,'' said Lin, a graduate student
at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, seeking
to broaden Moscow's links to the capitalist world, will meet with
South Korea's president next week in San Francisco, U.S. officials
said Wednesday.
   Moscow and Seoul have no formal diplomatic relations, and
Gorbachev's decision to hold the meeting represents the strongest
Soviet gesture yet toward South Korea.
   The Korea announcement came hours before Gorbachev arrived in
Washington for four days of summitry with President Bush.
   At a red-carpet welcoming ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base,
Md., Gorbachev said his meeting with Bush ``stands out in its
importance'' for an expected U.S.-Soviet agreement on the outlines
of a strategic nuclear weapons treaty.
   He also alluded to his desire to improve Soviet relations with
the non-communist world.
   Referring to the global importance of the Washington
discussions, Gorbachev said, ``A lot will depend on their results
in determining how things will work out not only between you
Americans and us but also on a larger scale.''
   Gorbachev was greeted by Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
and the pair traveled together to the Soviet Embassy for tea.
Soviet television broadcast tidbits from the embassy reception.
   About 1,000 people, both sightseers and protesters, were kept a
block and a half from the embassy, and as the motorcade drove by
the applause drowned out the boos.
   Among the protesters were about 30 people chanting ``Stop
killing Armenians'' and another group with Lithuanian flags and
signs saying such things as ``No tanks in Lithuania.''
   Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo on Monday in San Francisco, where he also will see Ronald
Reagan and former Secretary of State George Shultz.
   U.S. officials said they played no role in arranging the meeting
but were pleased to see it happen.
   Gorbachev flew to Washington from Ottawa, where he said after a
day of talks with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney that he
was waiting for the Western allies to sing ``a new melody'' on the
contentious issue of a united Germany's membership in NATO.
   Conflicting U.S. and Soviet views on the military alignment of a
reunified Germany _ and on the future role of NATO itself _ was
expected to be a major topic of Gorbachev's three days of meetings
with President Bush starting Thursday morning.
   ``The United States has strongly supported Seoul's efforts to
establish normal relations with the Soviet Union,'' said Margaret
Tutwiler, a State Department spokeswoman.
   Shortly before Gorbachev headed for Washington, the president
and the prime minister of Lithuania issued a joint statement on the
summit, stressing their desire for an early end to Moscow's
economic sanctions.
   In a videotaped message broadcast via satellite from Vilnius,
the Lithuanian capital, Kazimiera Prunskiene, prime minister of the
breakaway Baltic republic, said the energy situation there would
reach an ``essentially critical'' stage this week unless Gorbachev
agreed to end his cutoff of oil and other fuel shipments.
   ``We will be forced to stop not only the functioning of heating
systems, but also the nuclear power station, which is our primary
source of electricity, in order to avoid a disaster similar to
Chernobyl,'' Prunskiene said in reference to the 1986 nuclear power
plant accident that killed at least 31 people.
   While hoping to pressure Gorbachev into opening negotiations
with Lithuania on a transition to independence, the Bush
administration also is concerned that a mounting number of domestic
Soviet crises could break Gorbachev's grip on power.
   Administration officials sought Thursday to accentuate the
positive.
   ``He is a man of great political strength, clearly in control of
the political apparatus,'' said Raymond Seitz, assistant secretary
of state for European and Canadian affairs.
   ``It would be foolish to think he doesn't have problems, but
lots of political leaders have lots of political problems,'' Seitz
told reporters in a pre-summit briefing.
   During at least part of his stay in Washington, Gorbachev may be
able to set aside his worries. At least four U.S. organizations are
planning to present the Soviet president with special awards at a
ceremony Friday at the Soviet Embassy.
   The Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute said it would give
Gorbachev its Franklin Delano Roosevelt International Four Freedoms
Award for his ``extraordinary contributions'' in creating the
possibility of the United States and the Soviet Union once again
becoming allies.
   Also on Friday afternoon Gorbachev is to receive a ``Man of
History'' award from the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, a group
of religious and business leaders; the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Peace Award from the Friends World College of Long Island, N.Y.; an
the Albert Einstein Peace Prize from the Chicago-based Albert
Einstein Peace Prize Foundation.
   Earlier in the day Friday, Gorbachev scheduled a meeting with
congressional leaders at the Soviet Embassy.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he was
invited to attend the session, along with Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan.; Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., the majority whip; Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee; Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
Foreign Relations; House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.;
House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.; Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of Armed Services; Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
chairman of Foreign Affairs.

   An American and two citizens of the Soviet
Union won $10,000 prizes Wednesday for their proposals on how to
make the Soviet ruble convertible into dollars and other
international currencies.
   The winners were Giuzel Anulova of the Moscow Institute of World
Economy, K. Panov, a Soviet citizen who works for the United
Nations Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Franklyn
Holzman of Tufts University in Medford, Mass. near Boston.
   The prizes were awarded by a private San Francisco foundation.
   ``These papers have in common the underlying assumption that the
only effective path to ruble convertibility is through the creation
of a market economy,'' said a statement signed by six jurors in the
competition. Three signers were from the Soviet Union and three
from the United States.
   The Soviet Union needs dollars and other western or ``hard''
currencies to buy essential imports like grain and certain
machinery. To get hard currencies, it sells oil, natural gas,
diamonds, furs, arms, vodka and other exports.
   Ordinary people and most Soviet government enterprises cannot
simply go to world currency markets and offer rubles for dollars,
as citizens of other countries can trade their currencies. Few
people will buy rubles because the ruble can buy very little on
world markets. Many joint ventures involve awkward barter
arrangements to get around the lack of currency convertibility.
   The Soviet central government sets the rules for currency
conversions, including rates and amounts, to conserve its limited
stock of foreign currencies, and it controls the allocation of that
inventory.
   Major cities have lively black markets but these work only on a
small scale for individuals, who for instance may be willing to
spend the rubles they get in sightseeing and other tourist
activities. The black market cannot be used for the big
transactions of world trade.
   Officially, the ruble is worth about $1.56(0.64 rubles per
dollar). In fact, Soviet importers reportedly got only 80 cents
(1.25 rubles per dollar) for each ruble last year; travelers get 16
cents per ruble (6.26 rubles per dollar) and on the black market,
the ruble can go for as little as 6.7 cents (15 rubles per dollar).
   ``After two days of intense discussion the jury came away
impressed with the difficulties involved in devising a workable
strategy for achieving a convertible ruble, and also with the
immense importance of making headway on this issue,'' the jury
statement said.
   One of the Soviet judges was Ivan D. Ivanov, deputy chairman of
the Soviet Foreign Economic Commission. He suggested at a news
conference that convertibility might be achieved by the end of the
century.
   One of the American judges was Ed A. Hewett, a senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution, a leading Washington-based research
institute. He said the judges deliberately refrained from
distinguishing publicly among the ideas of the three winners.
   Another American judge, Anne O. Krueger, a professor of
economics at Duke University and former vice president of the World
Bank, said all the winners agreed that a first step would have to
be stabilization of prices within the Soviet Union.
   Stabilization would have to be followed by a freeing of prices
for all kinds of goods now regulated by the state, and finally
links between the Soviet domestic economy and the international
economy that she did not detail.
   The differences among the papers were small, she added, and
concerned such matters as the relative time and importance given to
the successive stages.
   Prices in the Soviet Union are highly controlled, and
inflationary pressures typically show up as shortages. Many prices
are to increase drastically on July 1 as the government hopes to
ease shortages.
   A second prize of $4,000 was awarded to each of three other
contestants:
   _Saltan Dzarasov, chairman of the Department of Political
Economy as the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   _Zsuzsa Kelen of the Hungarian Ministry of Finance
   _Kurosch Shafei of Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Their plans called for the Soviets to introduce a new kind of
money, parallel with the existing ruble, as a step toward
convertibility. The jury said it was not convinced a parallel
currency would necessarily work but recognized that a large body of
expert opinion supports the idea.
   There were 584 entries from 23 countries, according to
organizers of the prizes. There will be a conference in Moscow in
October where the winners and others will be asked to present their
ideas.
   The $42,000 in prize money came from the Furth Foundation of San
Francisco, Calif., which has previously spent much of its effort on
helping young Americans get educations.

   Any doubt that Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi
mixes with the rich and famous was dispelled Wednesday when one of
his personal phone books was admitted into evidence at his fraud
trial.
   Entries in the looseleaf book included presidents, entertainers,
athletes, business figures and apparently Leona Helmsley.
   Among the politicians: former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy
Carter; former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; and Robert
McFarlane, the former national security adviser under President
Reagan.
   Actors and entertainers included Christopher Reeve, Farah
Fawcett, Liza Minnelli, Paul Anka, Wayne Newton and Brooke Shields.
Also listed was George Hamilton, a close friend of Khashoggi's
co-defendant, Imelda Marcos, who earlier testified at the trial.
   The book also held phone numbers for Muhammad Ali, Chrysler
Chairman Lee Iaccoca and a ``Mrs. Helmsely,'' an apparent reference
to hotel queen Leona Helmsley, who last year was convicted of tax
evasion in the same Manhattan federal courtroom where Khashoggi and
Mrs. Marcos are being tried.
   The book was admitted into evidence during testimony by Robert
Shaheen, a longtime employee of Khashoggi, who said the phone
numbers were kept by Khashoggi's staff at his Fifth Avenue duplex
apartment.
   Khashoggi, once described as the world's wealthiest man, is
charged with obstruction of justice and mail fraud.

Convenes</HEAD>

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, setting the stage for the first post-Cold War summit,
staked out rival stands Wednesday on the military shape and
political alliance of a unified Germany.
   The Soviet leader opened his American visit with a warm
red-carpet welcome at a military airport, then moved on to a
boisterous greeting from a thousand people at the Soviets' downtown
embassy. Applause drowned out a chorus of boos.
   Secretary of States James A. Baker III welcomed Gorbachev and
touched immediately on the German question, which loomed as the
thorniest summit issue. ``Together our nations have the
responsibility to leave behind not only the Cold War but the
conflicts that preceded it.
   ``To do that we must see a Germany unified and Europe
reconciled,'' Baker said. He added, ``We want to see continued
movement toward democracy and openness in the Soviet Union.''
   Even as the Soviet leader arrived in Washington, there were new
indications of domestic turmoil: political maverick Boris Yeltsin
announced his intention to seek sovereignty for the republic of
Russia.
   Bush will formally welcome Gorbachev to the White House at a
Thursday morning ceremony of pomp and military honors. Vice
President Dan Quayle said the president spent Wednesday reviewing
``all the possible issues that could be raised, all the points he
wants to raise with Gorbachev.''
   At a pre-summit news conference in Ottawa, Gorbachev punctuated
the issue of German unity by complaining that the West was trying
to ``dictate'' the future of the new nation. ``This will not suit
us,'' he warned.
   Yet the Soviet leader did not mention the dispute when he
arrived in Washington.
   ``A lot will depend on our results,'' Gorbachev said. ``This
summit stands out in its importance, first of all, for the promise
it holds as the first major step to reduce strategic nuclear arms.''
   The two leaders were ready to sign long-sought agreements to
reduce nuclear and chemical weapons, but their differences on
Germany pushed to the top of the agenda on the eve of the four-day
meeting. Gorbachev emphasized his opposition to a united Germany
belonging to the West's NATO alliance and challenged Bush to offer
another solution.
   ``It seems that it is just like an old record that seems to be
playing the same note again and again. ... I would like us to find
a new melody,'' Gorbachev said in Ottawa.
   The White House said Bush was sympathetic to Soviet anxieties
about the military might of a combined Germany and said it would
pursue an answer that was ``politically acceptable and reasonable.''
   Gorbachev also voiced hopes for compromise. ``We do have some
leeway to find an accommodation. There are different scenarios that
might not be exactly what the West would propose.''
   In a reminder of Gorbachev's domestic troubles, Lithuanian
leaders sent a televised appeal via satellite to Washington for a
lifting of Moscow's economic blockade. They said oil shortages
threaten to shut down heating systems in the breakaway Baltic
republic. A few hours later, Yeltsin, the newly elected president
of Russia, said he would seek sovereignty for the Soviet Union's
largest republic.
   The summit, opening Thursday, was the biggest show in town.
   Red Soviet flags snapped in the wind alongside American flags in
front of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Vendors hawked summit T-shirts,
and television cameras staked out building tops within eyesight of
the White House.
   Thousands of demonstrators were poised to raise their voices in
Lafayette Park in protest of Soviet pressure against the Baltic
states and other issues.
   Gorbachev comes to Washington as a leader besieged by growing
domestic woes ranging from an economic crisis to fractures within
the Soviet Communist Party.
   Bush enjoys strong political support but stands accused by
conservative critics of giving away too much in arms deals to a
weakened Soviet leader.
   Bush, closeted with advisers in a final day of preparations,
gave the pre-summit limelight to Gorbachev.
   The president spoke by telephone with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who is trying to accelerate the move of East Germany
to the West into a single nation outside of Soviet influence.
   Bush also talked with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
who was Gorbachev's host during an overnight visit in Ottawa.
   U.S. and Soviet negotiators were wrapping up a dozen agreements
ranging from nuclear and chemical weapons to air travel and grain
sales for the leaders to sign at a formal ceremony Friday evening.
   ``As we move from conflict to cooperation, the agreements
reached on Thursday and Friday will provide for a realistic
foundation for the growing and changing U.S.-Soviet relationship,''
said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   He hinted Bush might be willing to sign a trade agreement with
Gorbachev despite differences over Lithuania's struggle for
independence. The treaty would be a step short of giving Moscow
coveted most-favored-nation trade status, which would lower tariffs
on Soviet goods.
   ``I intentionally want to be vague'' about prospects for a trade
pact, said Fitzwater. ``I urge you not to rule out anything.''
   Describing Bush's mood as one of ``anticipation and
confidence,'' Fitzwater said, ``The president sees a new horizon in
this meeting, a horizon of opportunity. And after these discussions
we should have a much better view of a new day in East-West
relations.''
   The sharp differences over Germany threatened to mar summit
harmony.
   The United States insists that a united Germany be a full
partner in NATO, politically and militarily.
   Gorbachev has been reluctant to let the World War II prize of
Germany slip away. He has proposed that it be a member of both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact, or that both alliances be isbanded.
   Fitzwater said Bush would explore the subject with Gorbachev
from the standpoint of seeking ``mutually acceptable options and
positions.''
   ``These issues are not going to be decided here,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said the size of German forces are ``of obvious
concern to the Soviets. We understand that.''
   He said the problem could be addressed within the context of
European-wide troop reductions in future talks, following an
expected first-stage agreement this year.
   ``We are opposed to any proposal which would single out Germany
for special (military) limits,'' he said.
   Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz, briefing reporters,
described the German question as an area of ``real conceptual
differences'' between the superpowers.
   He said the United States wants rapid unification, in ``an
orderly fashion'' with Germany enjoying the privileges and
responsibilities of all other nations in Europe.
   ``That doesn't seem to be the Soviet approach,'' he said.
   There were last-minute jitters over a pact to slash long-range
nuclear missiles and hopes for progress to cut troops and tanks in
Europe. U.S. officials said there was an impasse on a half-dozen
issues for a strategic weapons accord.
   The Soviets called in Col. Gen. Labronislav Omelichev, a nuclear
arms expert, in what was viewed by U.S. officials as a move to
settle some of the issues that have eluded negotiators over four
days of talks.

   Gen. Saw Maung said Wedneday that his
military regime was willing to lawfully hand over power to a
civilian government, but he warned that threats to national unity
could disrupt the process.
   In remarks to top government officials reported on state radio
and television, Saw Maung said the military would yield power to a
government formed by the parliament elected in Sunday's general
elections.
   Official results indicate that parliament would be heavily
dominated by the party most critical of Saw Maung's rule, the
National League for Democracy. Some Western diplomats and other
analysts have expressed skepticism over whether the military would
actually hand over power.
   Saw Maung told government employees ``to serve loyally any
government that comes to power.''
   But he said the military government would ``continue attending
to the country's need for security, transportation and food.'' He
did not elaborate.
   ``Whoever interferes in our carrying out our tasks of preventing
disintegration of the union, perpetuating national sovereignty and
protecting national unity will not be tolerated,'' Saw Maung said.
   It was the first public statement on the elections by Saw Maung,
who led a brutal suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in
September 1988 and established martial law.
   The military government called for general elections after the
crackdown and for a time allowed relatively free political activity.
   But when opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the charismatic
daughter of independence hero Aung San, criticized the military and
gathered mass support last summer, she was put under house arrest.
The co-leader of her National League for Democracy, Tin Oo, was
also jailed. Former Prime Minster Nu also remains under house
arrest.
   Sources in the National League for Democracy said their party's
unofficial vote tally showed they had gained 391 of the 485 seats
contested in the election. The latest official vote tally showed
the league had won 76 out of 82 seats.
   The official count apparently lags behind unofficial tallies
because signed certificates must be sent from polling stations to
the election commission in Rangoon, which has become a time
consuming process.
   The official Working People's Daily newspaper said 76 percent of
eligible voters turned out for the election, Burma's first
multiparty polls in 30 years.
   The military government, which still rules under a martial law
decree, has promised to turn power over to civilians once a new
constitution is completed and a strong government is in place.
   The election has proved a massive defeat for the pro-military
National Unity Party, which wielded unchallenged power when it
ruled under another name from 1962 to 1988.

<HEAD>Group Wants Attacks Halted on Human Rights Workers in Latin
America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International complained Wednesday that
attacks are increasing on human rights defenders and investigators
in Latin America and urged the Organization of American States to
take steps to stop the violations.
   In a letter to the OAS, the world human rights group cited
examples of obstruction, threats and harassment, torture,
disappearances and extrajudicial executions in Brazil, Colombia, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Peru.
   It identified 16 clergymen, priests, lawyers, politicians and
others who it said were threatened, tortured, abducted or killed in
the past 12 months.
   One case cited was that of Elizabeth Suarez Giraldo, a human
rights worker in Cali, Colombia, who reported being detained by the
army March 2 when she inquired about trade unionists in custody.
She said she was kept blindfolded and was tortured and raped before
being released April 19 after she was acquitted on charges of
violating an anti-terrorist law.
   The letter said that Luis Tenderini, president of the Brazilian
Justice and Peace Commission in Recife, was abducted and tortured
in March 1989 for demanding that death squads be investigated.
   It expressed concern over lack of ``substantial progress in
proceedings'' in the investigation of eight El Salvador soldiers in
last November's murders of six Jesuit priests and two others.
   In Guatemala, at least 77 members or sympathizers of the Council
of Ethnic Communities received death threats during the past year,
four were abducted and four others murdered, the letter said.
   It said violatons ``continued at an alarming level in the past
year'' against human rights defenders in Honduras, while in Peru
the Lima offices of the Andean Commission of Jurists and of Amnesty
were bombed Feb. 18 and March 4.
   The OAS General Assembly begins its 20th session Monday, meeting
in Asuncion, Paraguay. 9. An Amnesty International delegation will
attend as a special guest. The human rights group, which is based
in London, hopes its letter will be considered there.
   ``There was no specific incident that prompted us to send the
letter, but an accumulation of reports in our files,'' spokeswoman
Anita Tieson said.
   The letter, sent to the ambassadors of the 32 OAS member states,
said those responsible for the violations were generally the police
and military in uniform and plainclothes, acting as death squads,
and also civilian representatives of the army and citizens'
militias operating under military control.
   Official investigations of the abuses ``have been slow and
inefficient and almost invariably have not produced concrete
results,'' the letter said.
   Judicial authorities who tried to investigate reported
violations were sometimes threatened or attacked, it added.

   The layman son of a Presbyterian minister
was elected head of the Presbyterian church Wednesday, saying he
hopes to teach the love of Christ and a sense of community to a
church divided.
   Price H. Gwynn III of Charlotte, N.C., described himself as a
long-shot candidate who nevertheless sensed he might eventually win
leadership of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A).
   He won on a second ballot cast by the 605 commissioners meeting
in the faith's 202nd General Assembly to pick a successor to The
Rev. Joan SalmonCampbell. Gwynn, 67, received 322 votes, or almost
53 percent.
   ``I'm not a renegade,'' said Gwynn, who earlier had roused the
General Assembly with a speech critical of church bureaucracy.
   He said a belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ and his
Resurrection is all that is needed to heal rifts and a membership
malaise affecting the 2.9 million-member church.
   The church's membership has steadily declined over the past two
decades, losing more than 120,000 in the past three years and 30
percent of its membership since 1970.
   Gwynn said the cure lies not in the General Assembly, but in the
church's individual members and local congregations.
   ``If you are warm and inviting and the love of God is visible,
then I'm not concerned,'' he said. ``Rising water lifts all boats.''
   The new moderator, who will serve for a year, said the church
leadership needs to do a better job keeping abreast of the times.
   ``Change is driven by belief and faith and conviction. It is no
longer driven by technology. If we shoot ourselves in the foot,
we're going to have to answer for that,'' he said. ``This could be
a five million-member denomination by the year 2000.''
   Gwynn is the eighth moderator since factions of the church
reunited in 1983, healing a Civil War-era split over slavery. The
moderator presides over the General Assembly and represents the
church for the remainder of the year.
   Gwynn said he believes leadership may be out of touch with the
churchgoer, who worries more about the church itself than issues
such as whether homosexuals should be ordained as ministers _ a
topic the General Assembly likely will take up next week.
   ``The question I'm asked is, `Do we have our act together up
here ... can we put aside our differences to get our act together
in the world?''' Gwynn told the assembly, which meets through June
6.
   But emphasizing unity does not mean there is no place for
dissension, he said.
   ``We're going to disagree,'' said Gwynn, who pointed out
Presbyterians have a history of factionalism dating back to the
Civil War. ``Nobody should be shocked. But we don't have to agree
to work together.''
   Gwynn is a semiretired president of a Charlotte packing company
and chairman of the board of Presbyterian Hospital and Presbyterian
Health Services Corp.
   An elder in the Steele Creek church in Charlotte and father of
three, Gwynn said he is not an ``activist'' and has no plans for
radical changes. He said he could not support ordination of
homosexuals, who he said are sinners deserving of God's love but
not of the ministry.
   Gwynn said he supports ``responsible choice'' in dealing with
abortion. He said his experience with hospitals has taught him that
those who suffer when abortions are unavailable are the ``poor, the
powerless and the unwanted child.''
   About 750 Presbyterians from around the U.S. are attending the
10-day conference in Salt Lake City, the first meeting of the
Protestant denomination in predominantly Mormon Utah.

   Sikh militants in a jeep opened fire at
crowds in a Punjab village Wednesday, killing at least 10 people
and injuring 18, police said.
   Elsewhere in Punjab, seven other people were reported killed
Wednesday, United News of India said. The killings were reported
from separate areas in the prosperous northern farming state.
   In the village of Talwandi Bhaiyan, 70 miles south of Amritsar,
at least six militants in a jeep fired at crowds at two places,
Police Superintendent Anil Sharma said in a telephone interview.
   The militant Sikh insurgency for an independent nation has
claimed at least 950 lives in Punjab state this year. At least
1,821 people were killed last year.
   Sikh militants have been fighting for an independent nation in
Punjab since 1982, claiming Sikhs are discriminated against by the
majority Hindus.
   Sikhs are in a slight majority in Punjab but form only 2 percent
of India's 880 million people. Hindus make up 82 percent.

   Albanian Communist Party leader Ramiz Alia on
Wednesday told the first U.S. official delegation to visit his
country since 1939 that Albania wants to re-establish full
diplomatic relations with Washington as soon as possible.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif. said he had an ``extremely
long...lively, constructive'' meeting Wednesday evening with Alia,
whose hard-line Communist country has recently shown signs of
easing its extreme isolationist policies.
   Alia ``asked me to convey to President Bush and Secretary of
State (James A.) Baker their desire to establish full diplomatic
relations as early as possible, and I certainly feel the time is
right,'' Lantos said in a telephone interview.
   ``It is in the interest of both the United States and Albania''
to re-establish relations, Lantos said. ``We hope to have an
embassy in Tirana by September or October.''
   Lantos said ``Albanians have a long way to go'' in improving
their human rights record but said that should not stop the United
States from resuming relations.
   Another member of the U.S. delegation, Joe DioGuardi, a former
Republican congressman from New York, quoted Alia as saying that
Albania is interested in becoming a party to the Helsinki accords
on human rights.
   The official Albanian news agency ATA said Alia and Lantos had
``warm and friendly talks'' but gave no other details of the
meeting that was held in the People's Assembly in Tirana.
   The United States has long accused Albania _ the sole remaining
hard-line Communist state in Eastern Europe following a wave of
pro-democracy uprisings last year _ of human rights violations for
denying freedom of worship and emigration and other rights.
   The United States and Albania broke relations before World War
II.
   Lantos said Albania was also ``extremely eager'' to pursue joint
ventures with U.S. companies.
   Albania severed ties with the Soviet Union in 1961 due to an
ideological dispute, but has recently expressed interest in
restoring ties with Moscow.
   While Albania is reforming its political and economic system, it
has avoided any promises of instituting sweeping reforms similar to
those implemented by the other Eastern European nations.

<HEAD>Republicans Designate Political Unknown As Cuomo Opponent</HEAD>

   New York Republicans on Wednesday
nominated a political unknown to challenge Democratic Gov. Mario
Cuomo's expected re-election bid this year.
   ``I'm going into this thing to win,'' economist Pierre Rinfret
said in his acceptance speech.
   ``The Cuomo years have become a disaster,'' said Rinfret, who
was nominated by acclamation. ``The people of our state have twice
put their faith in Mario Cuomo. Unfortunately, he seems to have
lost faith in the people.''
   It had taken New York Republicans nearly a year to find a
candidate to challenge Cuomo. State GOP Chairman J. Patrick Barrett
had been turned down by one big-name Republican after another,
including U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
   Cuomo is expected to announce his plans to seek a third,
four-year term within days.
   Considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential contender,
Cuomo is generally viewed as a big favorite for re-election, even
by Republicans.
   Rinfret's acceptance speech was his first public appearance
since his name surfaced early last week as a possible candidate.
   The Canadian-born Rinfret, 66, has never run for public office
before. But he did serve as an unpaid adviser to Presidents
Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. He currently heads a New York
City-based economics consulting firm and he lives in Manhattan.
   Rinfret said he was running because ``I'm a lucky and successful
American dream.''
   He promised that if elected, he would ``cut tax rates and tax
burdens to restore economic growth'' and he pledged to ``enact the
death penalty and get tough on drug dealers.''
   Cuomo has presided over two consecutive years of $1 billion-plus
tax increases, including a record $1.8 billion in tax and fee
increases this year. The tax increases have become necessary
because of continuing budget deficits and economic problems in New
York.
   Cuomo has vetoed death penalty legislation every year since he
became governor in January 1983.
   Rinfret's lack of experience in politics and his abortion-rights
stance have prompted the state Conservative Party to reject him as
its nominee.
   Instead, the Conservatives plan to nominate New York University
professor Herbert London on Saturday as their gubernatorial
candidate. London could not convince GOP leaders to choose him as
their candidate. He then rejected an offer to be Rinfret's running
mate.
   A split between Republicans and Conservatives would divide the
anti-Cuomo vote and make the governor's re-election even more
likely.

   Syrian troops seized arms from rival
Shiite Moslem militias Wednesday in raids aimed at preventing new
clashes between the warring factions in west Beirut, police
reported.
   The Syrians also closed militia offices and banned gunmen from
wearing military fatigues, police said.
   Large quantities of weapons were seized in buildings and
apartments used by the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the Syrian-backed Amal militia in the daylong raids, police
reported.
   Syrian troops, armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers, also arrested a number of gunmen walking along
the streets, police said.
   Syrian patrols were reported in various districts throughout the
Moslem sector. Syria, with 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate, is the country's main power
broker.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting intermittently since May
1987 for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's
largest sect.
   At least 1,049 people have been killed and 3,136 wounded in that
power struggle.
   Last week, five people were killed and 42 wounded in street
battles between the two militias.
   The crackdown was launched after Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam held separate talks with the senior Sunni
Moslem cleric in Lebanon, Sheik Mohammed Rashid Kabbani, and the
Shiite spiritual leader, Sheik Mohammed Mehdi Shamseddine.
   Sources close to Kabbani quoted Khaddam as saying that
lawlessness in the Moslem sector of Beirut had to be halted.

<TEXT>
   An auto accident victim who died on the
operating table after sheets covering her caught fire was killed by
both the crash injuries and burns, the coroner's office ruled
Wednesday.
   Angela Hernandez, 26, a mother of four, died early Monday after
undergoing emergency surgery at UCLA Medical Center. She had
suffered heart and liver injuries when she was crushed in an
accident late Sunday in Santa Monica.
   Surgeons were about to take Hernandez out of the operating room
when the sheets and blankets ignited, the Fire Department has said.
   A medical examiner found no smoke in Hernandez' lungs but
determined she died both from burns and traumatic injuries suffered
in the crash, said Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman Scott
Carrier.
   ``It's going to be listed as an accidental death,'' Carrier said.
   Still under investigation Wednesday was the cause of the fire.
   Fire officials have said they were looking at whether a penlike
cauterizer used to stop bleeding from an incision was present in
the operating room along with pure oxygen. Such a combination was
blamed for a flash fire that killed a 15-year-old boy in an
operating room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in 1988.

   A 19-year-old North Las Vegas man
was arrested Wednesday in connection with the February slaying of a
member of The Coasters singing group.
   North Las Vegas Police Lt. Gary Rainey said Kinney Poole was
booked for investigation of murder in the shooting death of singer
Cornelius Gunter.
   Rainey said a police investigation into the Feb. 26 slaying of
Gunter gathered both physical evidence and eyewitnesses linking
Poole to the slaying.
   ``It all started to fall together about three weeks ago,'' said
Rainey.
   Rainey said robbery appeared to be the motive in the slaying of
Gunter, who was shot to death in his car at a North Las Vegas
intersection.
   Witnesses told police that a man was standing next to Gunter's
car and arguing with him at the time of the slaying. The man shot
Gunter and ran into the desert, tossing away a jacket as he fled.
   Gunter was a member of the doo-wop group whose hits included
``Yakety Yak'' and ``Charlie Brown.''
   Another former member of the group, Nathaniel ``Buster'' Wilson,
was shot to death in April 1980. His mutilated body was dumped near
Hoover Dam.

<HEAD>Gabon Says Murder Ruled Out in Opposition Leader's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition leader whose death set
off national anti-government riots apparently died of natural
causes and was not murdered as some protesters claimed, officials
said Wednesday after an autopsy.
   Military authorities meanwhile said an army patrol killed a
rioter during the night in the oil production center of Port Gentil.
   On Tuesday, protesters fatally injured a paratrooper there.
   Unconfirmed reports spoke of up to seven additional deaths in
Port Gentil, including a demonstrator whose body was shown to
journalists. Residents said relatives removed the bodies of other
victims.
   Rioting broke out last week in Libreville and Port Gentil in
this former French territory after the body of Joseph Rendjambe,
secretary-general of the opposition Gabon Progress Party, was found
in a hotel room.
   Many opposition supporters blamed President Omar Bongo's
government for the death, but officials in Libreville and in Paris
said preliminary results of an autopsy found no signs of foul play.
Gabonese and French doctors jointly conducted the autopsy.
   Needle marks were found in Rendjambe's stomach, but officials
said he was a diabetic who received regular injections in that part
of the body.
   In Paris, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas praised the performance
of French troops sent to Gabon to protect European oil workers and
their families during the disturbances. He said the troops would
stay as long as needed to protect the French community. His
ministry reported that about 2,000 of the more than 20,000 French
citizens in the former French colony were evacuated after trouble
broke out.
   Pierre Mamboundu, a Gabonese opposition leader speaking from
exile in Dakar, Senegal, said soldiers took Gabonese National
Assembly President Augustin Mbouma from his home in Libreville late
Tuesday. Mamboundou said Mbouma had threatened to quit Bongo's
governing Gabon Democratic Party.
   There was no official confirmation of such an action.
   At least 15 people were reported injured Tuesday in clashes in
Port Gentil as troops sought to retake control of the city from
protesters. Witnesses said at least 20 officials and supporters of
the Gabon Progress Party were arrested.
   Oil companies, which generate 80 percent of Gabon's income,
drastically cut production following the unrest. However,
Elf-Gabon, an affiliate of the French state-owned Elf company, said
Wednesday it had restored production to 90 percent of normal.

   Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley,
hospitalized with double pneumonia, showed marked improvement
Wednesday, a government spokesman said.
   ``This morning the doctors said he had turned the corner and
that he was no longer on the danger list,'' said Hartley Neita, who
was with Manley at the hospital. ``Naturally, they are still
monitoring and doing continuous tests to make sure everything is
normal.''
   Manley, 65, was flown to Miami Heart Institute from Kingston on
Monday.
   Doctors who are treating the pneumonia with antibiotics have
prescribed bed rest, said Neita.
   He said doctors have not indicated how long Manley will be
hospitalized, and they have indefinitely postponed prostate surgery
that Manley was scheduled to undergo June 5 at Sloane Kettering
Cancer Institute in New York.
   The prime minister is a socialist who has moderated his
positions and emphasized cordial U.S. relations since losing 1980
elections. He had served eight years as leader of the Caribbean
island nation. In February 1989, he returned to office after
leading his People's National Party to victory in 1988 general
elections.
   Manley had been admitted Sunday to Kingston's University
Hospital, where the pneumonia was diagnosed.

<TEXT>
   Croatia's first multiparty Parliament
in more than 50 years on Wednesday elected a retired army general
and former political prisoner as president of Yugoslavia's
second-largest republic.
   Thousands of flag-waving people gathered on a square outside of
Parliament in Zagreb's old quarter to greet Franjo Tudjman, leader
of the Croatian Democratic Union. The party won a landslide victory
in elections for the regional legislature earlier this month.
   The center-right party favors greater autonomy for Croatia
within Yugoslavia's six-republic federation. The party won 205 of
the Parliament's 356 seats and named Stipe Mesic as the republic's
prime minister.
   Tudjman was elected president Wednesday with 281 of 338 votes
cast.
   In his acceptance speech, Tudjman told delegates Croatia is
``willing to remain within Yugoslavia but only as fully sovereign
state in an alliance with other sovereign states.''
   He said Croatia would ``use the experiences of the free world,
and particularly the United States and Western Europe'' to create a
pluralistic political system.
   In an attack on the rival republic of Serbia, where the
Communist leadership is firmly entrenched, Tudjman said parts of
Yugoslavia where democracy had not taken hold would find Communist
rule ``represents a barren historical anachronism.''
   Croatia, a part of Yugoslavia since the country was established
in 1918, has long been at odds with Serbia, the largest republic.
   The 66-year-old Tudjman, who was once the Yugoslav army's
youngest general, spent almost five years in jail in the 1970s for
Croatian nationalism and ``hostile activities'' against the state.
Mesic also spent time in jail on similar charges.
   In a break with the republic's Communist past, a flag was
displayed at the meeting of Parliament bearing the red-and-white
checkered Croatian coat of arms instead of the Communist red star.
The Croatian national anthem was sung in place of the Yugoslav
anthem.
   Zagreb's cardinal, Franjo Kuharic, and representatives from
Croatia's Moslem and Jewish communities attended the sesion of
Parliament. The Serbian Orthodox church was not represented.
   Earlier Wednesday, thousands of people, including Tudjman,
crowded into Zagreb's 14th century cathedral to hear Kuharic pray
for ``the wisdom of those assuming responsibility for governing our
people.''

   Even though ABC said Laura Palmer's murder
would be resolved in last week's season finale of ``Twin Peaks,''
executive producer Mark Frost said he never made such a promise.
   ``I don't know what they would have been basing that on,'' Frost
said Tuesday in an interview from Hawaii. ``We never told anyone
that was our intention.''
   In fact, Frost said, it was decided long ago to keep the
audience guessing right to the end to force the network into
renewing the prime-time soap opera.
   ``We had no guarantee that ABC would ever renew us,'' Frost
said. ``I intentionally structured that last hour so that if ABC
was really curious about who killed Laura, they'd have to pick up
the show.
   ``Our sole strategy was survival. By withholding the identity of
the killer, we thought we were down to our last coin.''
   An ABC spokesman told the press early this month that the
mystery would be solved in the last show. But on Wednesday,
spokesman Bob Wright changed his tune.
   ``I was always under the assumption that the central part of the
story pertaining to the murder would be resolved,'' Wright said.
``I was wrong. From now on, I will not make any promises about
`Twin Peaks.'''
   So ``Twin Peaks'' will be back in the fall, along with, it
appears, disappointed viewers who charted every dizzying turn of
the show's nine hours trying to figure out who murdered the sleepy
Northwest lumber town's homecoming queen.
   On April 8, television was introduced to a world out of kilter,
confected by Frost and film director David Lynch, who made ``Blue
Velvet.''
   The ratings were only mediocre, but die-hard fans threw ``Twin
Peaks'' parties and more was written about the program than any
other in recent memory.
   So with much ballyhoo, ``Twin Peaks'' hurtled toward its season
finale with viewers waiting for the solution to Laura's murder, as
promised by ABC.
   ``There were a lot of people who were disappointed that they
didn't learn the identity of Laura's killer,'' Frost said. ``I just
think there was a misunderstanding somewhere.
   ``I can't give anything away, but when viewers come back _ and
we're coming back with a two-hour premiere _ I think their
curiosity will be satisfied.''
   What about the dancing dwarf who spoke backwards? And series
star Kyle MacLachlan, who had three bullets pumped into him at
point-blank range in the last episode?
   ``There are a lot of different ways that that can go,'' Frost
said. ``I think that when you see the show next year, you'll
understand why we left it that way. With scrutiny, everything so
far will come together.''

   An earthquake shook buildings from
Moscow to Istanbul on Wednesday and cut a path of destruction
across Romania, where eight people were killed and nearly 300
injured.
   Early Thursday morning, Bucharest was rocked again by a long
aftershock. It was felt at about 3:18 a.m. (8:18 p.m. EDT) and
lasted for nearly three minutes. There were no immediate reports of
new damage or casualties.
   Chunks of concrete from high-rise buildings crashed to the
ground and crushed people Wednesday in this capital city of 2.2
million, killing two. Tens of thousands of residents rushed into
the streets, many crying and screaming in fear as ceilings fell,
walls cracked and books toppled from shelves.
   Romanians leaped in panic from windows and balconies, and some
were badly hurt, ambulance officials said.
   It was the third major earthquake since 1977 with its epicenter
in Romania's Carpathian Mountains. Its force was felt in the Soviet
Union and Bulgaria _ where injuries were reported _ and in Hungary,
Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Poland.
   The quake center was 190 miles northeast of Bucharest, in the
wooded Vrancea range.
   BBC monitors in London, quoting the Bulgarian news agency BTA,
said one person died in Silistra of a quake-induced heart attack.
Soviet legislator Ilmars Bishers said initial reports indicated
some Soviet deaths occurred, but he gave no details.
   Richter scale readings ranged from 6.5 to 7.5. Uppsala
Seismological Center in Sweden said the quake was felt so widely
because it was about 63 miles deep.
   ``I think it was this deafening sound of cracking walls that
scared people,'' said clerical worker Sica Burcea, 52. ``The
building was swinging horizontally and vertically. We were lucky
only to have some cracks in the walls. I shivered when I realized
1977 was coming back.''
   More than 1,500 Romanians died in a 1977 earthquake.
   A communique from the General Inspectorate of Police said two
people died in Bucharest, two in the Danube River port of Braila,
and one each in eastern Buzau, southeastern Ialomita, central
Brasov and nearby Prahova County.
   Food shop clerk Petruta Lungu was killed when she ran outside
and was hit by bricks and concrete falling from an upstairs wall,
Bucharest police said. A man's body was pulled from rubble outside
the shop.
   The inspectorate reported 296 people injured, 45 critically. It
said 35 of the critically injured were in Bucharest, where 102
people were hurt.
   ``I fell on the stairs as the earthquake was reaching its peak
and my fingers went out of their sockets,'' said Cristina Amza, 28,
who was recovering from an operation at Bucharest's Emergency
Hospital. ``It was a nightmare.''
   The earthquake lasted for about 45 seconds, the Romanian news
agency Rompres said.
   In Moscow, Soviet officials said the quake was felt from the
Crimea to the Baltics and damaged dozens of buildings in the
southwest.
   In Ottawa, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he was
told shocks shook Moldavia and Armenia but ``no devastation, no
destruction.'' He said he saw no reason to break off his trip to
return home, as he did in December 1988, when a quake killed an
estimated 25,000 people in Armenia.
   In Soviet Moldavia, bordering on Romania, six people in Kogul
were hospitalized for quake-related injuries, Lt. Ivan Koltuk of
the regional Interior Department said by telephone.
   Buildings shook throughout Moscow, 1,000 miles east of
Bucharest, including the offices of The Associated Press. The
10-story U.S. Embassy building was evacuated. Telephone lines were
knocked out and buildings shook in at least four Soviet republics.
   In Istanbul, the Anatolia News Agency said tremors were felt in
eastern Thrace in Turkey and elsewhere around the Marmara Sea
region.
   The quake also was felt in Hungary.
   A nuclear power plant was shut down in Kozlodoui, Bulgaria, on
the Danube.
   The quake hit when Bucharest's streets were crowded with
lunch-hour shoppers and pedestrians. Many people tried to get home,
creating a huge traffic jam that police said was made worse because
the capital's main thoroughfare, University Square, was blockaded
by anti-Communist demonstrators.
   The mayor had announced the square would be cleared Wednesday.
Some protesters saw the quake as divine intervention to keep them
from being ousted.
   ``The demonstrators were swearing at Iliescu when the earthquake
struck,'' said Dr. Dragos Nicolescu, 42, who has been tending
hunger strikers supporting the protesters. ``They said it was a
sign of God that Iliescu would fall.''
   The earthquake struck 10 days after Romanians elected onetime
Politburo member Ion Iliescu president. The protesters want former
Communists like Iliescu banned for 10 years from holding public
office.
   The Richter scale gauges the amount of energy released by a
quake as measured by the ground motion recorded by seismographs. A
quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage. One of magnitude 7 is
reckoned as a major earthquake.
   The National Earthquake Center in Golden, Colo., registered the
initial quake at 6.5 and Thursday's aftershock at 5.9.
   ``We've had no reports of injuries or damages, but certainly a
5.9 is capable of that, especially when people are asleep,'' said
Pat Jorgenson, with the U.S. Geological Service in Menlo Park,
Calif.

   Railroad crews worked Wednesday to
collect 120,000 gallons of jet and diesel fuel spilled just
upstream from a wildlife refuge when 19 tanker cars derailed.
   Soggy terrain and the remote location hampered cleanup workers,
but officials said more fuel would have seeped into a creek running
into the refuge if not for beaver dams on both sides of the Alaska
Railroad tracks.
   ``I would have to give the railroad a good grade on first
response and the beavers even a better grade,'' said Al Townsend, a
biologist for the state Department of Fish and Game.
   The last of the derailed tankers were dragged away Wednesday and
the Alaska Railroad reopened, with trains moving at reduced speed,
said Dale Nelson, environmental engineer for the railroad.
   A 68-car train was transporting more than a million gallons of
jet and diesel fuel from a refinery at North Pole to Anchorage on
Memorial Day when 19 cars jumped the track about 40 miles south of
Fairbanks. Seven tankers tore open, dumping fuel into beaver ponds
on both sides of the tracks.
   Some fuel was seeping into Goldstream Creek and the 500,000-acre
Minto Flats Wildlife Refuge, a prime waterfowl nesting area.
   ``One of our concerns is the fairly substantial number of pike
and whitefish that just finished spawning,'' said Mac McLean of the
Fish and Game Department. ``The eggs could hatch anytime, and
that's a pretty sensitive life stage.''
   He also said beaver, muskrat and otters were particularly
threatened.
   Suction machines had skimmed an estimated 10,000 gallons of the
spilled fuel by late Wednesday. Work had been slowed, however,
because the pumps were mounted on rail cars and couldn't get past
the tangled pile of derailed tankers, officials said.
   An oily sheen extended at least eight miles down Goldstream
Creek despite the beaver dams and plywood dams and absorbent booms
laid by crews.
   The refined fuel is more toxic than crude oil, but can evaporate
more quickly if exposed to air and sunlight. State environmental
officials planned to have the creek water tested to determine
underwater levels of toxicity.
   Representatives of local, state and federal agencies met
Wednesday to discuss a long-term cleanup plan, which the railroad
must submit by Monday to the state.
   Railroad investigators took routine blood tests for alcohol and
drugs from the three crew members on the train, and brought the
train's speed indicator to Anchorage for inspection.
   Tests showed the train was moving within the 44 mph limit posted
for the area when it derailed, said railroad spokeswoman Vivian
Hamilton.

   An artist's use of an alleged ethnic slur in
the inscription of a steelworker statue is being attacked by
Croatians, the United Steelworkers union and other ethnic and labor
groups.
   The 12-foot fiberglass statue, in the middle of a downtown park,
is inscribed with the title and signature: ``Hunky Steelworker.
Luis Jimenez '90.''
   ``The sculptor's choice of words has touched a raw nerve among
our members across a wide range of ethnic backgrounds,'' said
Andrew V. ``Lefty'' Palm, director of the union district that
covers Pittsburgh steelworkers.
   ``It's a blatant insult,'' said Edward Verlich of the Croatian
Fraternal Union. ``We aren't trying to deny anyone freedoms, but we
don't want this emblazoned on a statue where a half-million people
will see it.''
   The term ``hunky'' originated in the late 1800s as a term to
describe people of Hungarian descent, but its use was expanded
quickly as an insult toward anyone whose ancestors came from
central Europe, said Sarah Thomason, a professor of linguistics at
the University of Pittsburgh.
   ``It's also of the same origin as the word `honky,' which some
blacks use to describe whites,'' Ms. Thomason said Wednesday.
   The city's controller, Tom Flaherty, noticed the inscription on
the back of the statue while jogging past it. Last week, he held a
press conference at its base to decry what he called a slur against
eastern Europeans.
   The statue was erected as a tribute to steelworkers.
   Jimenez, the artist, expressed surprise at the criticism of his
work.
   ``I certainly didn't think there would be a problem with this,''
he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ``I was trying to pay tribute
to the contributions steelworkers have made to this country.''
   Jimenez, 49, of Hondo, N.M., said he researched steelworkers at
Pittsburgh's Carnegie Library.
   ``I came across the term `millhunk' or `hunky' as a way that
steelworkers referred to themselves,'' he said. ``I used it as a
term that was part of the popular culture. I didn't mean it as any
kind of derogatory term.''
   Verlich, the son of a Croatian father and Czechoslovakian
mother, said he didn't fault Jiminez but would like to see the
title changed.
   ``He thought he was using a term of endearment, but the term is
derogatory and inflammatory and has no business on a statue in the
city of Pittsburgh,'' Verlich said.
   The city's Croatians and other ethnic and labor groups have
suggested that covering up the `Y' in hunky _ forming ``Hunk
Steelworker'' _ would be appropriate. The new title could work,
they said, because the steelworker depicted is disproportionally
stout in a hunk of fiberglass.
   ``They can cover that with plastic,'' Verlich said.
   The organizers of the Three Rivers Art Festival, which brought
the statue to the city, have said they'll meet with people who
don't like the statue but won't remove it from the park's most
prominent part.
   The festival director wasn't available immediately Wednesday.
The festival opens Friday.

   A strong earthquake killed at least 115
people, injured more than 800 and almost destroyed several towns in
Peru's northern jungle, Civil Defense officials said Wednesday.
   At least 42 people were missing after the quake Tuesday night,
which officials called Peru's deadliest in two decades. It was
followed by dozens of aftershocks, including one Wednesday morning
that measured 5.1 on the Richter scale.
   Civil defense officials declared a state of emergency late
Wednesday in San Martin province, 400 miles north of Lima.
   At least 35 of the confirmed 115 deaths from the quake occurred
in Moyobamba, a farming center of 50,000 people and the provincial
capital of San Martin, officials said.
   Most of the other dead were from nearby villages in the jungle
area.
   The Civil Defense said at least 818 people were injured.
   The quake, measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale, occurred at 9:33
p.m. and lasted 45 seconds, the Peruvian Geophysical Institute
reported. It was centered in the jungle 75 miles northeast of
Moyobamba, the institute said.
   The institute earlier Wednesday gave a Richter scale measure of
5.8, but revised that figure Wednesday night. An institute
spokesman said Wednesday night the area was hit by at least 45
aftershocks, including one that measured 5.1 on the Richter scale.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. said
the quake measured 6.3 on the Richter scale.
   Local police reports reaching Lima by radio Wednesday said
several villages around Moyobamba suffered widespread damage and
were nearly destroyed.
   Civil defense authorities said the area was completely cut off
from electrical service and telephone communications due to the
quake.
   Gen. Jorge Ferreyro, Peru's Civil Defense chief, said a downtown
church in Moyobamba was destroyed, and most municipal buildings
were badly damaged.
   Ferreyro said Moyobamba had few doctors and officials there were
asking the government to send doctors, medicine and electrical
generators.
   Health Minister Paul Caro Gamarra said an air force plane left
for Moyobamba on Wednesday afternoon carrying a team of 10 doctors
and emergency supplies.
   Health department workers have been on a nationwide strike for
two months, but a union official in Lima said workers were helping
with emergency plans.
   Patricia Vargas Llosa, the wife of presidential candidate Mario
Vargas Llosa, visited the area Wednesday, accompanied by former
President Fernando Belaunde Terry.
   In a news conference on returning to Lima Wednesday night, Mrs.
Vargas Llosa said damage was extensive and many people were being
treated in tent hospitals for fractures and other injuries.
   ``The people there are terrorized because the ground is still
shaking,'' she said.
   Belaunde Terry said the worst damage appeared to be in Soritor
and Porvenir, two villages located about 12 miles from Moyobamba.
   The quake came two days before the 20th anniversary of a
devastating earthquake that killed 70,000 people in the northern
Andes Mountains.
   That quake, the most deadly ever recorded in the Western
Hemisphere, registered 7.7 on the Richter scale. An estimated
20,000 people in the city of Yungay were killed that day, buried in
mud and ice that came crashing down from a nearby mountain.
   In Ecuador, two slight tremors shook Quito and Guayaquil Tuesday
night and early Wednesday, the Astronomic Institute of Quito
reported. There were no reports on damage or injuries.
   The institute said the epicenters of the quakes were located in
the Pacific Ocean, near the Peruvian coast.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage,
and a quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Army Called Out To Restore Order in Pakistan Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto called
out the army on Wednesday to stop the bloodshed in her embattled
home province, where ethnic-related violence has killed more than
300 people in the past two weeks.
   ``Enough is enough,'' she told a news conference. ``We will not
tolerate terrorism. We will be dealing with a strong hand.''
   Ms. Bhutto said the army would work with the civilian government
of Sind Province, where Karachi and her political power base lie,
to stop the sniper shootings, kidnappings and violent clashes
between rival ethnic groups and security forces.
   While she spoke, police said gunfire killed 20 people and
wounded 25 in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city with a population of
more than 5.1 million. Officials said that brought the death toll
since Sunday to 109.
   Despite widespread 24-hour curfews, sniper shootings broke out
in other parts of Karachi, police said. They said three victims
were shot in Clifton, the posh neighborhood where the prime
minister maintains a home, they said.
   The bloodshed has prompted daylong strikes in other cities
across Pakistan and led to mounting criticism of Ms. Bhutto and
appeals from all quarters for her to act to stop the violence.
   Police blame current violence on a militant faction of the
Mohajir Qami Movement, a small political party representing Moslem
Indians who emigrated to Pakistan during the 1947 partition of the
subcontinent. The movement demands recognition as Pakistan's fifth
nationality, along with the Pathans, Punjabis, Baluch and Sindhis.
   Ethnic tensions between the refugee Mohajirs and native Sindhis
have faded and flared for five years, claiming more than 2,000
lives.
   Fighting began anew on May 15.
   Heavily armed soldiers already patrol parts of Karachi and
Hyderabad, a city of 3 million people that was once considered
``Sind's paradise.''
   When the army chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, visited
Hyderabad on Tuesday, an estimated 100,000 people greeted him,
pleading that he guarantee their protection, witnesses said.
   One fear is that handing Sind to the army would be the first
step toward returning the entire country to military rule. Pakistan
has spent 25 years of its 43-year history under military
dictatorship.

   As his domestic troubles multiply, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev heads for Washington expressing confidence that he and
President Bush will find a way to permit German unification without
upsetting the balance of power in Europe.
   Asked Tuesday if he was optimistic about reaching agreement over
Germany and its membership in NATO, Gorbachev replied, ``I am sure
of that. And tell that to the American people.''
   His comment marked a sharp turn from the gloomy assessments of
Bush and his top advisers in recent days, and Gorbachev's own
warning that U.S. insistence on NATO membership for a united
Germany could stall the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern
Europe.
   The Soviet Union has moved progressively from outright
opposition to German reunification to acceptance of the concept
under some formula that would provide assurances a new German giant
would never again pose a military threat to its neighbors.

   The KGB apparently isn't all that concerned
about Washington's reputation as the nation's murder capital. But a
myriad of demonstrations promise to hold the attention of Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's protectors, described by one Soviet official as ``a
big bunch of people with big guns.''
   Richard Adams of the Secret Service said Tuesday the KGB didn't
ask about dangerous sections of town, and no such information was
volunteered. The two agencies are chiefly responsible for keeping
Gorbachev safe during the summit.
   Gorbachev will be staying at the Soviet Embassy just a few
blocks from the White House _ a relatively safe part of the city _
and most of his planned schedule revolves around the embassy and
the White House.
   There have been no slayings in the embassy's neighborhood in
recent memory. To ensure Gorbachev's tranquility, the entire block
of 16th Street in front of the embassy will be closed to traffic
throughout the week, said Metropolitan Police spokeswoman Shannon
Cockett.

   Those nuggets are among the information, from the momentous to

   The forms illustrated how for most House members, the $89,500

   Mayor Marion Barry acknowledges in a published
interview that he smoked crack cocaine the night of his arrest, but
he contends federal authorities tried to kill him by providing a
potent dose.
   In an interview in today's editions of The Washington Post, the
mayor also said he was confident he would not be convicted on drug
and perjury charges because ``in this town all it takes is one
juror saying, `I'm not going to convict Marion Barry.'''
   Barry said the FBI sting operation in January that led to his
arrest was part of a long effort by federal authorities to
discredit him.
   ``The prosecutors have been dipping and dabbling in the politics
of Washington for a long time, and it's unconscionable,'' the mayor
was quoted as saying. ``And then they tried to kill me, it's

   NASA scrubbed today's launch of
Columbia and its $150 million observatory because of two hydrogen
leaks and said repairs could delay liftoff until next week.
   The 12:28 a.m. mission was postponed six hours before liftoff
after sensors detected rising levels of hydrogen gas in Columbia's
engine compartment during fueling of the rocket Tuesday with liquid
oxygen and liquid hydrogen.
   Although hydrogen is highly combustible, NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone said ``the vehicle was never in an unsafe position at any
time.'' The seven astronauts on the all-scientific mission were to
have boarded hours later.
   Repairs are not expected to start until tonight, and it will be
at least several days before launch, Malone said. All fuel must be
drained from Columbia's big external tank before workers can return
safely to the launch pad.

   Nguyen Van Nam sat at his ``home'' at the High

   If Hong Kong refuses to grant him refugee status, he said

   Similar responses were echoed by several other High Island
residents during interviews Tuesday, indicating that the days of
tranquility for what has been a model detention center for
Vietnamese boat people may be numbered.
   So far, High Island has been free of the rioting, mass escapes

centers for boat people since a group of 51 Vietnamese were

   MTV's most popular executive caused a bit of
a stir when he abruptly quit last fall.
   Lee Masters, adored by the music industry and credited with
making the cable network solvent, walked out because, he said,
``The new structure didn't give me much room for growth or
authority.''
   Translation: MTV's new owners wouldn't let Masters run the show.
   Now he does, for a different, brand-new cable network that he
predicts will become MTV for adults.
   On Friday, the E! entertainment network will become the first
24-hour all-entertainment cable channel on television. Bankrolled
for the most part by Home Box Office, E! will transmit celebrity
news, interviews, movie picks, television features, fashion tips
and just about anything and everything related to Hollywood.
   ``People watch this kind of stuff,'' Masters said. ``They're
certainly not going to watch it every day, but the idea is to have
something for adults to watch the way youngsters and kids watch
MTV.''
   Isn't that what ``Entertainment Tonight'' is for? Or
``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous?'' Or, better yet, the
Movietime channel, which E! replaces?
   Yep, said Masters, but there's plenty to go around because
Americans have insatiable appetites for inside glimpses of
beautiful people and their seemingly beautiful lives.
   And Movietime, with its own version of 24-hour entertainment
programming, obviously never had Lee Masters at the helm or a huge
infusion of capital.
   E! already has interviews with Mel Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer and
Darryl Hannah in the can. The round-the-clock programming will be
divided into two-hour segments hosted by a male and female
``anchor.''
   Complementing the glitz of Hollywood is a media blitz of E!'s
own. At the recent National Cable Television Association convention
in Atlanta, E!'s lavish display (long on ``bells and whistles''
according to one attendee) wowed many.
   No expense has been spared on extravagant press kits or on the
network itself. According to Masters, E! has a $43 million ``war
chest,'' most of it from HBO.
   Although HBO is only one of 10 equity partners in E!, it is the
managing partner and chief financial backer. Other equity partners
include Comcast Corp., one of the country's biggest cable
operators, Warner Cable, Cox Cable and Continental Cablevision.
Many of these same backers were behind Movetime before it was
replaced with E!.
   Masters, whose programming ideas helped bring game shows to MTV,
is quick to point out that managing partner or no, HBO doesn't run
E!. Masters does.
   ``They don't really run the show,'' he said. ``There are a lot
of players and a lot of conflicting interests'' _ meaning the
number of equity partners.
   Although he does not shape programming, which made his name at
MTV, Masters said he is much happier with his lot at E!.
   ``Basically, I run the whole business,'' he said, ``which is why
I left MTV.''
   Thus far, E!, which will be part of basic cable service, has
spent $10 million to get the network up and running, Masters said,
and has signed on cable operators representing 14.5 million viewers.
   By the end of the year, Masters estimated, that number will be
20 million. But to do battle with the big cable networks such as
ESPN and the USA Network, he'll need more like 50 million viewers.
   ``The real key to us,'' Masters said, ``is that when we did our
research, we found there were two segments _ the celebrity,
personality-driven viewers and the solid information segment.
   ``What we're trying to do is meld the two.''

   Denizens of Western churches are marching in.
They're entering the once forbidden atheist territory of Eastern
Europe, providing preachers, teachers, equipment, building funds
and Bibles.
   Lifting of most restrictions on religion in the Soviet Union and
collapse of communist regimes in satellite countries have thrown
open the doors to the West's missionary enterprises.
   ``It's a tremendous opportunity,'' says the Rev. John D.
Erickson, chairman of the United Bible Societies, aiming for $58
million to send 30 million Bibles to that region. About 1.7 million
copies went there last year.
   ``The barriers to God's word are now down.''
   Erickson, also general secretary of the American Bible Society,
the U.S. branch and major budgetary source of 110-nation united
societies, says most all U.S. denominations participate in the work.
   Many of them also have launched their own special new programs
in countries that formerly shackled religion to help churches
there, spiritually strong from their long ordeal but lacking
material resources.
   Southern Baptists, the largest U.S. Protestant body, earmarked
$2.5 million for expanded activity in that region, about $1.5
million mainly for educational supplies and evangelism, the rest
for basic relief, chiefly in Romania.
   The denomination's foreign missions board also is assisting in
establishing a Baptist seminary in Moscow, and sending successive
teams of student volunteers for construction work this summer on a
seminary in Leningrad.
   Twenty-five additional career missionaries _ teachers, printers,
``partner'' evangelists, agriculturalists, broadcast specialists
and others _ also are being rounded up to serve in the region.
   ``The days in which we're living are some of the most momentous
and cataclysmic ... in a long, long time,'' says the Rev. R. Keith
Parks, the mission board's president, citing the widenened fields
for service.
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops established a special committee on
ways to aid newly liberated Catholicism in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, with a delegation going there to ascertain needs.
Plans are to be set in September.
   Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, the committee chairman,
called it ``an historic opportunity to help'' fellow Catholics
``rebuild their church after it was almost literally dismantled
over the past half century or more.''
   The United Methodist Church's Advance Fund, which handles
special designated giving, in April approved askings for 41
projects in Eastern Europe totalling about $2.6 million.
   ``There are new opportunities for ministry, evangelism and
church growth in these countries,'' says Doreen Tilghman, in charge
of work in that region for the denomination's Board of Global
Ministries.
   She said the ``opening up'' of the region had brought a flood of
requests for help, including printing equipment and supplies and
ministry training for lay and clergy.
   Approved projects included aid in renovating a church in Tallin,
Estonia, another in Stromica, Yugoslavia, and literature, printing
equipment and building improvements in Poland, including books for
a Warsaw seminary.
   Through various units, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) in March
approved $1.75 million of ``extra commitment opportunity'' projects
in Central and Eastern Europe.
   Funds were to be disbursed for Bibles, theological literature,
public evangelization, education of new church leadership,
refresher courses for pastors and repair of church facilities.
   Churches of Christ, a large but loosely knit U.S. network of
independent evangelical churches, embarked on a yearlong campaign
for $15 million to strengthen evangelism in Eastern Europe.
   The Slavic Gospel Association, based in Wheaton, Ill., launched
a ``Send the Light'' campaign for channeling Bibles, educational
materials and aid for training clergy to the region, and
broadcasting a Bible program.
   ``We've been praying for opportunities like these for decades,
but what has happened exceeds even our wildest hopes and dreams,''
says Peter Deyneka Jr., the association president.
   To coordinate $6 million in requests from Baptists in Eastern
Europe's churches, the Baptist World Alliance set up a ``Baptist
Response _ Europe'' committee to set priorities for routing aid to
needs.
   ``Literally thousands of individuals, groups and churches are
trying to rush in and help,'' says a committee official, the Rev.
Keith Parker, based in Zurich, Switzerland.
   Many individual congregations have formed ``sister-church'' ties
with congregations in Eastern Europe, providing aid and
encouragement, links developed through visits arranged by the U.S.
National Council of Churches.
   Also, groups of churches have combined to undertake various
projects. North Carolina Baptists, in a partnership with Polish
Baptists, have lined up 500 North Carolina volunteers in a
three-year project to build a Polish seminary.
   A heavy flow of teacher exchanges also was developing, with
professors from various American church-related colleges and
universities taking on short-term assignments with counterparts in
Eastern Europe.
   As an example, professors Ivan Fahs and Jim Mathisen of Wheaton
College in Illinois and Paul deVries of King's College in
Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., visited Moscow at the invitation of the
Soviet Academy of Science to discuss moral-ethical issues and the
relevance of the Ten Commandments to Soviet society.

<DATELINE>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anthony Tarracino, a 73-year-old former
saloonkeeper and boat skipper better known as ``Capt. Tony,'' says
this island city is ``not your normal town in the U.S.''
   That could be an explanation of his qualifications to lead it.
   Tarracino has fathered 13 children with five women, been
portrayed in a Hollywood movie and claims to have spent much of his
life flouting the Mafia, Fidel Castro, various neutrality laws and
the establishment in general.
   Since last November, he's been mayor of Key West. And by many
accounts, he's not doing badly at it.
   ``I tell you what he ain't doing _ he ain't doing anything
crazy,'' says Pritam Singh, the young multimillionaire developer
transforming the former Navy base here into a $250 million upscale
community.
   That might sound like an unusual way of grading a mayor's
performance, but people weren't quite sure what to expect after
Tarracino's slim runoff election victory last November. His
unofficial campaign slogan: ``All you need is a tremendous sex
drive.''
   Over three decades as the proprietor of Capt. Tony's Saloon, a
former hangout of Ernest Hemingway, Tarracino's reputation was not
for municipal acumen but for being a character who stood out on an
island full of them.
   No one knows for sure how much of Tarracino's self-recited
history is true, possibly not even he, after nearly 30 years of
retelling that began with his desire to give visiting journalists a
colorful feature story. They often came away describing Tarracino
as ``a character out of a Hemingway novel.''
   The story goes something like this:
   He was born in Elizabeth, N.J., became a Teamsters organizer,
then fled when mobsters discovered he was placing bets with their
bookies on horse races that already had been run.
   He came to Key West, and became a boat captain in 1948. Besides
charter fishing, he skippered gun-running and mercenary expeditions
and sneaked refugees out of Cuba and CIA agents back in.
   He bought his bar in 1962 and began perfecting his stories, some
of which were depicted with Stuart Whitman playing Capt. Tony in a
1980 low-budget dud called ``Cuba Crossing.''
   He ran for mayor four to seven times _ he doesn't count some of
them because he wasn't running seriously, he says. Along the way,
he fathered children ranging in age today from 53 to 4 years by
three wives and two other of the 10 women he's lived with.
   He lost a 1985 runoff election for mayor, then came back to win
last year in a rematch with banker Tom Sawyer, 3,049 votes to 3,017.
   Opinions vary on why Tarracino was elected. His opponents
grumble that people felt sorry for him after so many defeats.
Supporters say Tarracino represents a reaction against the
direction Key West is heading.
   The 27,000 people of the southernmost city in the continental
United States face costly problems stemming from living on an
island in an era when Florida is enforcing environmental protection.
   Sewage treatment costs residents $600 a year, and garbage nearly
$300, property taxes are six mills, and other costs, from rent to
the water that must be piped in from the mainland, also are
skyrocketing.
   Tensions are high among developers who see demand for more
condominiums, businesspeople who say the city must increase its tax
base, and ``the little people'' for whom Tarracino claims a mandate.
   As expected, Tarracino has focused his mayorship on fighting
developers.
   He's helped the city commission overcome business interests to
slash rents for vendors who ply their trades at the popular nightly
sunset festival on Mallory Square docks, and has led protests
against Navy plans to build military housing on Peary Court, a
27-acre green space in the island's middle popular for picnics,
softball and Frisbee-tossing.
   Tarracino admits getting confused sometimes by statistics and
procedures, but he relies on a broad range of friendly advisers.
   In the mayor's office early one day after a commission meeting
the night before that lasted to 11 p.m., Tarracino expounds on the
struggle he sees going on in Key West.
   ``People came here looking for their utopia,'' he says.
``They're dreamers, artists, people with high IQs. Whether it's
making beads or painting or fishing, they came here for their
little paradise in the sun.
   ``Then look at all these big hotels. It's all built on paper.
And when they stop making money, they'll pull out and leave the
stake holes.
   ``These are the people who are going to tell us what the rules
are, how to live here? They're strangers.''
   Although one of his campaign selling points was the news media
attention he would attract as mayor, Tarracino has no intention of
being a laughable figurehead. He got a copy of Robert's Rules of
Order after his election and rehearsed commission meetings with
friends.
   He dons a navy blue blazer for meetings and usually restrains
himself from injecting his own rhetoric into debates.
   Although the $10,000-a-year post is meant to be only part time,
Tarracino usually spends six to eight hours a day in his office. He
sold his bar, but goes there regularly to chat and sign posters for
tourists.
   Many other times, the mayor is available at the dog track.
   ``I'm like Ann Landers,'' he says. ``People know they can come
in and I'll listen to them.''
   Tarracino, who says he ``loves every minute'' of his job,
already is talking about running for re-election in 1991.
   But Richard Heyman, a two-time mayor who runs an art gallery,
expects people concerned about the tax base problems and other such
issues to be more active behind their own candidates in the next
election.
   ``I think Tony's intentions are good, but he's totally off-base
in his directions,'' Heyman says, noting, ``He only won by 32
votes.''

<BYLINE>Vacation Homes: Can Play Still Pay?
^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the approach of summer comes the peak
season in the sun for a special breed among American investments _
the vacation home.
   Whether the property of your dreams is a waterfront villa or a
modest cabin in the woods, vacation real-estate boasts many virtues
with enduring appeal.
   There aren't many other ways to combine in a single package the
pursuit of leisure with the business of trying to build a financial
nest egg and make it grow.
   The idea is simplicity itself. Or at least it was until the
architects of the nation's tax system went to work on it.
   Thanks in large measure to their regular efforts at additions,
alterations and redesign, owners of vacation properties in the
world of the 1990s need to be pretty fair hands at tax planning if
they want to maximize both the psychic and the financial rewards of
their investments.
   The key distinction to be made is how to classify the place _ as
a personal residence, a rental property, or a combination of the
two.
   If you never rent it to anybody else, it logically qualifies as
a personal residence, making mortgage interest (within limits) and
property taxes eligible under ordinary circumstances as deductions
on your tax return.
   With a property in this category, expenses such as upkeep and
repairs cannot be deducted.
   When you can rent a property out for less than 15 days a year,
its status as a personal residence still applies.
   At the other end of the spectrum, a place that is continuously
occupied by paying tenants and never used by the owner is a rental
property, subject to a completely different set of rules.
   Owning and operating a rental residence is a type of business
venture known as a ``passive activity,'' in which all expenses can
be deducted from income when you are settling up accounts with
Uncle Sam.
   In some cases, expenses exceeding your ``passive'' income can
also be deducted. One rule, for example, allows a tax loss of up to
$25,000 for people who are primary owners and managers of
properties and who have adjusted gross income from all sources of
$100,000 or less.
   A property is still a ``rental'' if your personal use of it
doesn't exceed either 14 days or 10 percent of the number of days
it is rented to others.
   And what if you, say, live in a home for two months in the
summer and rent it out the rest of the year? That's a personal
residence, notes the accounting firm of Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   ``The portion of expenses allocable to rental use of the home
will be deductible only to the extent of rental income,'' the firm
points out.
   It concludes: ``Decisions regarding the best tax posture for a
vacation home should be accompanied by a comprehensive assessment
of each individual's personal tax circumstances.''
   In a good many areas of the country, vacation-home owners have
lately had a complaint that they share with other real-estate
investors: Prices just aren't going up the way they did a few years
ago, and making money on a property isn't as easy as it used to
look.
   Will those good old days come back? Maybe, suggests John T. Reed
in his newsletter Real Estate Investor's Monthly, but then again
maybe not.
   ``I know of no law of economics which says real estate will
appreciate for extended periods in the future,'' he says. ``Buying
real estate and waiting for market-wide appreciation is
speculation.''
   To invest rather than speculate in real estate, Reed advocates
looking diligently for properties selling at bargain prices or
susceptible to upgrading strategies that can increase their value.

<HEAD>Cunhal Keeps Portugese Communists on Orthodox Course</HEAD>
<HEAD>By PAUL AMES</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The winds of change have forced reform
on Communists throughout Europe, but veteran leader Alvaro Cunhal
is keeping his Portugese party firmly to the traditional course.
   ``Our party continues to declare itself a Marxist-Leninist
party,'' he told 2,000 delegates to the group's congress last month
in Loures, a Communist bastion 12 miles from Lisbon.
   ``Few of our comrades have expressed the opinion that the PCP
should follow the path that other Communist parties have trod,''
Cunhal said.
   Delegates raised clenched fists in salute and cheered their
leader, who is 76 and has led the party since 1961. They re-elected
him unanimously despite hints earlier this year that he might
retire.
   Cunhal's decision to stay on may worry the growing reform
movement, but the congress also chose Carlos Carvalhas, a
48-year-old economist and member of the European Parliament, for
the new post of assistant general secretary.
   The combination of Cunhal and Carvalhas, who is more pragmatic
but not a member of the reformist wing, may be an attempt to mend
the rift between dissidents and the old guard.
   Reformers want the party to adapt its political program to
reflect the new situation in Eastern Europe, where the Soviet bloc
has collapsed, and Portugal's position as a stable democracy within
the 12-nation European Community. They also demand greater
democracy and openness in party operations.
   Party leaders have dealt firmly with dissenters.
   Zita Seabra, a leading campaigner for women's rights, was
expelled from the ranks in January after arguing for Cunhal's
resignation, a change in the party name and abandonment of
traditional ideology.
   Jose Luis Judas, a trade union official and leading critic of
Cunhal, was barred from the Loures congress. Other critics have
been dismissed from the party Central Committee.
   At the congress, Cunhal accused reformers of ``forming factions
that act in a conspiratorial and organized way within the party,
and carrying out a media campaign that places their action in a
wider anti-communist campaign against the party.''
   ``This will not be permitted,'' he declared.
   Dissidents say only reform can halt a decline that has seen the
party's share of the national vote drop from 21 percent in 1979 to
14 percent in December, when local elections were held.
   Some change has resulted from the fall of Communist regimes in
Eastern Europe. Cunhal acknowledges his former comrades ``commited
serious errors and isolated themselves from their people.''
   He has paid lip service to the reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the Soviet president, but also said anti-communist forces backed by
the West could ``compromise the building of socialism.''
   Cunhal's party supported the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the Kremlin's intervention in
Afghanistan, which lasted nearly a decade. It was silent on the
brutal repression of China's pro-democracy movement a year ago and
sent delegates to the Romanian Communist Party congress before
Nicolae Ceausescu's downfall in December.
   Despite media reports of poor health, Cunhal demonstrated in two
lengthy speeches to the congress that he had lost none of his fiery
speaking style. Delegates in the Loures' Hall of Peace and
Friendship interrupted frequently with applause and chants of
``PCP! PCP!''
   Cunhal spent 12 years in prison under the right-wing
dictatorship that governed Portugal for nearly half a century
before a coup in 1974 opened the way for democracy.
   His 40 years of resistance to the dictatorship, years in jail
and torture by the secret police earned Cunhal legendary status
among followers and the respect of political opponents.
   Judas said recently that Cunhal would continue running the party
even after retirement.
   ``Its a bit like Deng Xiaoping,'' the senior Chinese leader,
Judas said. ``Even when he leaves the leadership, it's he who
commands.''
   He said the party must change because, ``in the future, being a
Communist won't be the same thing as being a Communist in 1917. ..
. If the Communist parties don't change, adapt, then they'll
disappear.''

<HEAD>Jarring Contrasts of Ancient and New in Damascus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boxy apartment-office building on
concrete stilts surmounts ruins of the 2,000-year-old Roman Temple
of Jupiter, dramatizing the clash of old and new in this teeming,
ancient city.
   A modern, marble-clad temple of commerce with jewelry shops and
clothing boutiques is next door, opposite the ancient Islamic
Medressah, or School of Nur ed-Din.
   ``It's a bad integration of the old and the new,'' said Nazih
Kawakibi, a professor of architecture at Damascus University who
serves on several restoration committees. ``They could have done it
much better.''
   Like many cities in the Middle East, Damascus is bulging at the
seams, trying to provide housing and services to a population
estimated at 2 million.
   Damascus is considered one of the world's oldest continuously
inhabited cities. The Arameans, nomads from the Arabian peninsula,
settled here in 1200 B.C., eventually building a city that became
an important commercial center.
   Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Ottomans have occupied
Damascus. A treasure trove of monuments reflect the cultural tides
that have swept over the city.
   Some ancient sites, like the famed Ummayyad Mosque, were
venerated by all the occupiers.
   The mosque site originally was a temple to Haddad, the Aramean
god of thunder and lightning.
   It later became the Roman Temple of Jupiter. The Byzantines
built a cathedral there, but the Arabs transformed it into the
mosque, named for the Islamic dynasty.
   Only limited resources are available to preserve the the ancient
sites.
   Kawakibi pointed to the Medressah, just on the edge of a
straight, European-style avenue cut through the city by French
colonizers in the 1930s.
   ``They stopped here; they didn't go further, thanks be to God,''
said the architect, who has devoted his life to preserving Old
Damascus.
   A 14th century tomb of the Mamelukes has been rented to a cloth
merchant, who destroyed the original lintel and cut a door through
an ancient wall to allow access to his shop.
   ``Unless we propose a solution to blend those monuments with the
commercial life of the Old City of Damascus, this is the way it all
will go,'' Kawakibi said.
   ``These buildings shouldn't function as commercial buildings,
but as museums or cultural centers. They're all registered as
historical monuments, but the law hasn't been able to prevent them
from being transgressed.''
   In one old mosque, the antique wooden minbar, or preacher's
stand, was ripped out and left in the entrance, to be replaced by a
concrete one.
   An architectural gem, the 11th century Nur ed-Din hospital, is
sandwiched between a modern shop selling shwarma, thinly sliced
meat wrapped in Arabic bread, and a jewelry store. It was restored
in the late 1970s.
   ``Parasitic buildings accumulated around it, but they're now
just part of the ambience,'' said Kawakibi, who was instrumental in
the renovation.
   Only one of the original stone-lattice windows, carved in
intricate geometric designs, had survived. Master craftsment copied
it faithfully.
   A few painted Koranic inscriptions remained on the domed
ceilings. Instead of repainting them, restorers gently penciled in
missing portions of the holy book's text.
   In a display case are ancient herbal medicines, including one
called ``aphrodisiac radish, diuretic, activates the functions of
the genital glands.''
   The hospital and dozens of other old buildings are tranquil
havens in a bustling, noisy city, as are the 11th century baths,
reached through a small door in the midst of the bazaar.
   The baths saw hard times, even becoming a soap factory at one
point.
   Now, men swaddled in towels sip at glasses of boiling-hot tea
after a searing bath and massage. They read their newspapers
beneath a dome painted with complicated flowery designs.
   Renovation is not always popular.
   ``When you're trying to renovate these buildings, there's a lot
of protest because they don't understand what is meant by
renovation,'' Kawakibi said. ``They think you mean destroying the
old buildings and putting up new ones.''
   At the Masjid al-Madrassah al-Umariyah mosque and school
complex, which dates from the time of the First Crusade in the 11th
century, dozens of squatters who built concrete huts on the grounds
are being evicted.
   In deciding how to proceed, restorers rely on old drawings,
their knowledge of the architectural practices of the time, and
sometimes photographs from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
   In the 1960s, the government and experts drew up a master plan
for the city, which included providing modern services and
preserving the old city. It has become hopelessly outdated.
   Even a devoted restorationist like Kawakibi acknowledges that
``attention should be paid to modern problems more than old ones.
We need infrastructure, telephones, transportation.''

   Ragtag children marched around a burned-out
truck, stopping now and then to point through locked gates at huge
portraits of Che Guevara in a derelict camp where hundreds of Cuban
soldiers once lived.
   ``Soldiers gone,'' Pedro said, shouldering a gnarled stick to
imitate the Cubans. United Nations observers say 33,000 of the
50,000 Cuban soldiers in camps like Viana have left for home since
Angola and Cuba signed U.S.-brokered accords with South Africa in
December 1988.
   Unfortunately for children like Pedro and his friends, not only
the soldiers are leaving.
   Deprived of their military protectors, hundreds of Cuban
doctors, nurses and teachers stationed in this southern African
nation are leaving hospitals, health centers and schools already
crippled by 15 years of civil war.
   Western sources expect the last Cuban civilians to leave Angola
by the end of next year, six months after all the soldiers have
gone.
   UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, says the war between
the Marxist government and Jonas Savimbi's U.S.-supported rebels
has taken the lives of more than 100,000 Angolans and maimed at
least 20,000.
   About 1.5 million people, one-sixth of the population, have been
displaced. Most of the refugees are women, children and old people.
   Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
known as UNITA, claims more than 200,000 have died since fighting
began shortly after the 300,000 Portuguese colonials went home in
1975, leaving behind virtually no trained medical staff or skilled
workers.
   Of the 738 qualified doctors now in Angola, 509 are foreigners,
including 170 Cubans who have worked primarily in poorly equipped
provincial health stations. Isidro Diez, Cuba's economic counselor
in Luanda, the capital, said those isolated centers often were
targets of rebel attack.
   Diez said more than 500 Cuban teachers also were leaving.
   ``As our troops move north, the civilian workers go with them,''
he said. ``It's normal. No country would leave their civilians
unprotected.''
   The U.N. Development Program hopes to bring 24 doctors and
paramedics to Angola in the next 18 months, mostly from Brazil,
where Portuguese also is the national language. Otto Essien, who
represents the agency, said a maximum of six doctors would arrive
this year and more than 700 were needed.
   ``The problem is, the Cubans have gone to regions where others
don't go,'' said Francine Matthys, Luanda coordinator for Doctors
Without Frontiers, a private European group that is helping manage
health centers and hospitals.
   She said the Cubans ``don't do much training _ they have enough
to do filling the shoes of missing Angolan doctors _ and that has
created a sort of dependence.''
   Drugs also are short in the provinces. Medicines distributed by
the inefficient centrally planned system often are lost, stolen or
destroyed in rebel ambushes.
   Another problem is a 4-year-old drought, which the United
Nations says affects 800,000 people in four province of central and
southern Angola. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has
appealed for emergency food, medicine and funds.
   Bie, a war-torn province in the central highlands, has only one
doctor for each 49,714 inhabitants, and neighboring Huambo has one
midwife for every 123,527 people, according to Health Ministry
figures.
   Luanda has grown from 350,000 people at the start of the war to
more than 1.5 million, many of whom live in shantytowns, and has
only one civilian hospital. The other, Americo Boavida, is the
county's largest but is undergoing a two-year renovation.
   Morale among overworked Angolan medical personnel is low.
   Leading doctors earn the equivalent of $860 a month at the
official exchange rate _ but that equals only $14 on the black
market. During a cholera outbreak last year, doctors treated up to
100 cases a day in Luanda alone.
   At the Kwzola orphanage, home to 163 of Angola's estimated
40,000 war orphans, 9-year-old Raul was playing with a toy truck in
a green-and-white fleet made from oil cans by Dani, the home's
12-year-old resident engineer.
   Raul, who chattered happily with visitors, wants to become a
pilot and fly to Namibia. Dani kept to himself, staring silently at
the MiG jet fighters landing at nearby Luanda airport.
   Conceicao Almeida Dias, assistant director of the orphanage,
said Dani was brought in by soldiers last year from Uige, a
northern province where the rebels are strong.
   ``His parents were killed in the war, but we haven't been able
to get anything else out of him,'' she said.
   Francisca, 3, fled in tears when strangers approached.
   ``She had some sort of trauma and is already psychologically
disturbed,'' said Paula Francisca, a teacher at the home, which was
built with Italian aid.
   Stephen Johnson, emergency projects officer for UNICEF, said
only 3,500 or so orphans were in such homes. ``The rest are out in
the community, but we don't know exactly where and there's no
proper followup care,'' he said.

   Here are some facts and figures on Angola:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Angola covers 481,350 square miles, stretching about
800 miles from Zaire in the north to the desert frontier of
Namibia. The Atlantic Ocean is on the west and Zambia on the east.ern of
the Soviets _ Fitzwater said.
   The White House press secretary disputed news accounts
suggesting Bush would offer assurances on limiting German forces to
bolster Gorbachev's standing at home.
   On prospects for a trade agreement during the summit, Fitzwater
said, ``I intentionally want to be vague.'' He added, ``I urge you
not to rule out anything.''
   ``This is an issue that really will depend on Gorbachev and
Bush,'' he said. The Bush administration has held up the trade
agreement to protest the Soviet Union's economic sanctions against
Lithuania and Soviet failure to enact liberal emigration
legislation.
   In a move to resolve disputed arms control issues, Col. Gen.
Labronislav Omelichev, first deputy on the Soviet defense
ministry's general staff, headed for Washington to enter talks on
possible nuclear and conventional fores agreements for Bush and
Gorbachev to announce.
   On the question of German troop levels, the United States still
maintains such discussions should be held as part of future talks
on reducing conventional forces in all of Europe, Fitzwater said.
   ``We are opposed to any proposal which would single out Germany
for special limits,'' he said.
   However, Fitzwater said the summit would include ``discussions
on the general question. We want to hear their concerns and their
interests. We'll express our policy.''
   ``This is not an issue which is linked in any way to German
unity nor to the renunciation of four-power rights,'' Fitzwater
said, referring to control of Germany's destiny by World War II
victors Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union.
   ``President Bush will be exploring the subject with President
Gorbachev from the standpoint of exploring mutually acceptable
options and positions. Again, these issues are not going to be
decided here,'' he said.
   However, an administration official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said Bush hopes to nudge Gorbachev into accelerating the
first round of conventional arms talks under way in Vienna,
Austria, so a treaty can be completed by year's end.
   Bush was described as firmly opposed to a Soviet proposal that a
united Germany be excluded from NATO's military structure while
remaining within its political framework.
   Gorbachev was upbeat about the German issue as he spoke to
reporters Tuesday outside Mulroney's residence in Ottawa. Gorbachev
said he was confident that he and Bush will find a way to preserve
the balance of power in Europe after East and West Germany are
unified.
   Asked if he was optimistic about agreement on Germany and its
membership in NATO, the Soviet leader replied: ``I am sure of that.
And tell that to the American people.''
   U.S. officials disclosed that Gorbachev would meet with South
Korean President Roh Tae-woo in San Francisco after the Washington
summit ends with a Bush-Gorbachev news conference on Sunday. The
Soviet leader's plan to meet Roh was viewed as a further warming in
relations between the two countries, which recently established
``consular departments'' in trade offices in each other's capitals.
   Before flying to Washington, Gorbachev acknowledged the
emergence of a new domestic worry _ the election of political
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin as president of the Russian republic _ as
a major earthquake struck Eastern Europe.
   Gorbachev told reporters that ``everything is OK'' in the Soviet
Union despite the quake that struck Romania this morning, killing
eight people, injuring 260 and causing widespread damage. Tremors
were felt in Moscow and Leningrad and a Soviet lawmaker said
initial reports from the republic of Moldavia indicated there were
an unspecified number of deaths.
   The Soviet leader said he saw no reason to break off his trip
and return home. A major earthquake in Soviet Armenia in December
1988 forced Gorbachev to cut short a visit to the United Nations in
New York, where he also met with President Reagan.
   In advance of the Soviet leader's early evening arrival, it was
announced that Vice President Dan Quayle will meet Gorbachev
briefly on Friday at the Soviet Embassy to discuss cooperation on
space exploration.
   Arms control negotiators for the two countries, meanwhile,
wrangled for more than two hours Tuesday over U.S. and Soviet
conventional forces in Europe as well as their nuclear arsenals,
including bombers and submarines.
   Meeting in secrecy at the State Department, they made some
progress toward reductions in both areas. They agreed, for example,
on definitions for such conventional weapons as tanks and armored
personnel carriers, which will make it easier to verify that treaty
terms are carried out, an official told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
   Although Secretary of State James A. Baker III's recent trip to
Moscow led to agreement on sea and air-launched missiles, a handful
of tough strategic weapons issues remained unsettled.
   Arms control issues still in dispute include whether to ban
ballistic missiles with multiple warheads and the number of flight
tests the Soviets could conduct of their heavy SS-18 missiles. The
arsenal of such missiles is to be halved, from 308 to 154, but
there is no agreement restricting improvement in the missiles that
remain.
   Bush and Gorbachev still are expected to issue a joint
declaration of progress toward a major reduction in nuclear
arsenals, officials said, but they cautioned that long-range
nuclear weapon issues still disputed may be excluded from that
declaration.
   On the economic front, State Department spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said Tuesday that a new commercial air travel agreement
has been initialed. Officials said it will be ready for signing at
the summit.
   It would more than triple air service between the two countries
and would vastly increase Soviet visits to the United States,
Tutwiler said.
   In addition, officials said the two presidents will sign a new
five-year grain agreement, virtually settled in March. A pact that
would make it easier for U.S. and Soviet commercial vessels to
deliver goods in each other's countries also was ready for signing.

pastoral letter on women is so unsatisfactory that it might as well
be abandoned.
   In a column in the archdiocesan weekly, Catholic Herald, he said
the ``very credibility of the document comes into question'' in
treating the issue of women's ordination.
   He said that the document emphasizes women's equality, but fails
to deal with the traditional link between church authority and
ordination, a role the document rejects for women, as does the pope.
   ``It is easy to see the bind the authors are in,'' Weakland
wrote. However, since the letter avoids a basic question involved,
he suggested dropping the effort.

that years of research by his polling organization have found gaps

told the Evangelical Press Association's annual convention.
   Gallup said most Americans say they believe in God and Jesus and
trust the Bible. But he said statistics show Americans are ignorant
of the doctrines and history of their chosen faiths, and half of
the nation's Christians do not know who delivered the Sermon on the
Mount.
   ``We revere the Bible, but don't read it,'' he said. ``We
believe the Ten Commandments to be valid rules for living, although
we can't name them. ... We believe in God, but this God is often a
totally affirming one, not a demanding one. He does not command our
total allegiance.''

<HEAD>Religious Groups Receive Greater Freedom Under Glasnost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUSTIN BURKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religion may play a vital role in saving the
Soviet Union from collapse, but greater personal freedom under
perestroika means potential difficulties for some groups, U.S.
religious leaders say.
   President Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of greater openness has
created opportunities for spiritual development in the Soviet Union
that were unimaginable just five years ago, said the Rev. V. Bruce
Rigdon of Grosse Pointe, Mich.
   But the challenges facing Soviet church leaders are immense
because they lack the resources to deal with a myriad of problems,
said Rigdon, chairman of the National Council of Churches
U.S.-Soviet Working Group.
   ``For more than 70 years the Communists used systematic
oppression to stifle religion, and that resulted in a flat and
boring culture in which alcoholism became prevalent,'' Rigdon said
in a telephone interview.
   ``They (religious leaders) are up against the greatest challenge
since those faced in 10th-century Russia, when Christianity first
appeared in that country. They now have to Christianize the
population all over again.''
   A strong religious tradition will greatly facilitate the
revival, but attending to the spiritual needs of the populations is
only part of the problem for churches.
   If Gorbachev introduces economic reforms that cause high
inflation and unemployment, ``the role of the churches and welfare
organizations will become crucial,'' Rigdon said.
   Rigdon, pastor of Grosse Pointe's Memorial Presbyterian Church,
added, ``The church may find itself overwhelmed because it doesn't
have the infrastructure, ability or experience.''
   The Orthodox Church in Leningrad already has received government
permission to open a hospital, but finding trained personnel so far
has been a problem, he said.
   Foreign help will be required to help churches through the
initial crisis, U.S. church leaders agreed.
   Rigdon said the best thing that people in the United States can
do is listen.
   ``It's sort of an American curse to think that we know what's
best, and we shouldn't make that mistake again,'' he said. ``Rather
than what we think should happen, we should respect how churches
already there feel.''
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom of Chicago, head of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America, said a way to better understand Soviet
needs is through exchange programs.
   ``If we had more grassroots contacts, it would improve the
situation,'' said Chilstrom, who has visited the Soviet Union three
times in the past three years.
   ``They don't really want handouts, but they do want help in
setting up a free-enterprise system and establishing a democratic
system,'' Chilstrom said.
   Fostering democracy and free speech has a down side for some
Soviet religious groups, particularly Jews, said Rabbi Arthur
Schneier of New York City, president of the interfaith Appeal of
Conscious Foundation, which works to promote religious freedom.
   ``There are some dark feelings that are emerging as a result of
the newfound freedoms in the Soviet Union,'' Schneier said. ``There
are nationalist forces who in a demagogic fashion are trying to
scapegoat Jews for all the shortages in the Soviet Union...
   ``It will take a collective effort from the intelligentsia,
government and church to make sure the situation doesn't get out of
hand.''

<HEAD>A Banner Season on Broadway Makes for Strong Tony Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A banner season on Broadway means Sunday's
annual Tony Awards celebration will have something it hasn't had in
a long time _ respectable and, in some cases, strong competition in
several categories.
   But ``City of Angels,'' a Hollywood detective musical, and ``The
Piano Lesson,'' August Wilson's drama about a black family coming
to terms with its past, are favorites for the top awards of best
musical and best play.
   The two-hour festivities, to be broadcast by CBS starting at 9
p.m. EDT, will be presided over by Kathleen Turner, a best-actress
nominee for her sultry performance in the box-office smash revival
of ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   Among the stars scheduled to perform or present awards are
Matthew Broderick, Len Cariou, Dixie Carter, Michael Crawford,
Morgan Freeman, Timothy Hutton, James Earl Jones, Kevin Kline,
Bernadette Peters, Joan Rivers, Jessica Tandy and Lily Tomlin.
   This year's theme will be ``the year of the actor,'' with actors
doing solo turns. Kline will do a soliloquy from ``Hamlet,'' a role
he currently is playing off-Broadway.
   As usual, the program will feature scenes from best play and
best musical nominees. ``City of Angels'' will compete against
``Grand Hotel,'' Tommy Tune's stylish recreation of Vicki Baum's
novel set in the 1920s. The musical received 12 nominations, more
than any other show, including two for Tune for best
director-musical and best choreography.
   The other best-musical nominees are ``Aspects of Love,'' Andrew
Lloyd Webber's tale of passion in post-World War II France, and
``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a lavish stage version of the famous Judy
Garland movie.
   ``The Piano Lesson,'' which already has won this year's Pulitzer
Prize for drama, faces its stiffest competition from ``The Grapes
of Wrath,'' an adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel by Frank Galati
and Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company.
   Also nominated are ``Prelude to a Kiss,'' a Manhattan fairy tale
by Craig Lucas, and ``Lettice &amp; Lovage,'' Peter Shaffer's look at
an eccentric British tour guide played by Maggie Smith.
   Miss Smith and Miss Turner are top contenders for best actress
honors. They will compete against Geraldine James, who played
Portia in a revival of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' and newcomer
Mary-Louise Parker, the bewildering bride in ``Prelude to a Kiss.''
The prize probably will go to Miss Smith.
   Dustin Hoffman, snubbed by Tony nominators six years ago for his
performance in Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' received a
best-actor nomination this year for playing Shylock in ``The
Merchant of Venice.''
   He is the biggest name, but the strongest competition comes from
Robert Morse, who portrays writer Truman Capote in the one-man play
``Tru.'' Also nominated are Tom Hulce as a brash lawyer in the
military courtroom drama ``A Few Good Men'' and Charles S. Dutton
of ``The Piano Lesson.''
   Unlike the 1989 awards when two categories _ best book of a
musical and best score _ were eliminated, this year's competition
will have a full complement of 19 categories. One category,
choreography, was whittled down to three nominees instead of the
usual four because of a scarcity of competition.
   Last year, Tony suspense was minimal with only three shows in
the best musical competition _ ``Starmites,'' which quickly folded,
and two revues, ``Black and Blue'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.''
   Even the 1989 best play, ``The Heidi Chronicles'' by Wendy
Wasserstein, was a predictable winner.
   One sure winner Sunday is Tyne Daly, who plays the formidable
Mama Rose in the revival of ``Gypsy.'' Her competition for best
actress in a musical includes Beth Fowler of ``Sweeney Todd,''
Georgia Brown of ``3 Penny Opera'' and Liliane Montevecchi of
``Grand Hotel.''
   The two stars of ``City of Angels,'' James Naughton and Gregg
Edelman, are nominated for best actor in a musical and compete
against David Carroll, the debonair jewel thief of ``Grand Hotel''
and Bob Gunton, who played the title role in the revival of
``Sweeney Todd.'' Naughton is the likely winner.
   The 1989-90 season was one of the best in terms of quantity and
quality.
   There were the inevitable flops, musical duds like ``3 Penny
Opera'' starring Sting and ``The Prince of Central Park.'' But
there also were a variety of plays and revivals, many with big
names. In fact, a lot of them weren't nominated for a Tony.
   Among the also-rans were Vanessa Redgrave, who starred in a
controversial revival of Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus Descending''
and Rex Harrison, Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger, the three stars
of Somerset Maugham's ``The Circle.''

   Under the restructuring, the 44-year-old company said Tuesday it
plans to sell or close some of its test and measurement operations
and non-television communications businesses.

   Under a new air travel agreement slated to be
signed at the Bush-Gorbachev summit, Americans would be able to
sample glasnost and local delights in some of the more exotic
Soviet cities.
   Americans longing to see the ancient Golden Gate in Kiev or
diamond mines in Magadan, Siberia, would finally get their wish.
They also would be able to fly to Minsk, Tbilisi, Khabarovsk
(another Siberian city) and Riga, the capital of Latvia.
   New flights to those places from the United States are sure to
be filled, Alexey Mesiatsev, a spokesman for Intourist, the Soviet
tourism organization, said Tuesday.
   ``Demand is very big right now; the Soviet Union is one of the
hottest tourist destinations,'' Mesiatsev said from his office in
New York.
   He said some 150,000 Americans visited the Soviet Union last
year, up from 125,000 in 1988, 110,000 in 1987 and 25,000 in 1980 _
when relations between the two countries hit a low point.
   Nearly all arrived by air. Commercial flights between the two
countries now serve New York, Washington, Moscow and Leningrad.
   So far at least, U.S.-Soviet travel has been mostly a one-way
street. Only 460 Soviet citizens visited the United States last
year, most of them officials on tours organized around glasnost
themes.
   Under the new agreement, concluded on Sunday, air travel between
the two superpowers will be greatly expanded, possibly quadrupled.
And the two countries also will inaugurate regular cargo flights.
   The air agreement represents closer ties as Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev tries to get a grip on his troubled economy.
He will meet with President Bush beginning Thursday.
   The air travel accord will add four U.S. cities _ Anchorage,
Alaska; Chicago, San Francisco and Miami _ and the six new Soviet
cities to current airline routes.
   Six additional U.S. airlines will be allowed to fly between the
two countries, and a planned new Soviet airline will be able to
participate in U.S.-Soviet service.
   Currently, only Pan American World Airways and the Soviet
national airline Aeroflot fly U.S.-Soviet routes. Aeroflot launched
its first major marketing campaign in the United States last spring.
   A number of U.S. carriers have expressed interest, including
Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Alaska Airlines and Northwest
Airlines.
   A Pan Am spokesman was skeptical about a new wave of U.S.
tourists hitting the Soviet Union and whether there would be enough
passengers to fill new flights to that country.
   ``We do believe that the market is still rather thin and the
additional (airline) capacity is not warranted by the demand,''
said Jeff Kriendler.
   Delta spokesman Neil Monroe said his airline plans to apply to
the Transportation Department for permission to fly between Delta's
base of Atlanta and Moscow, and possibly Leningrad and Tbilisi. The
latter, the capital of the Soviet republic of Georgia, is the
sister city of another Georgia town, Atlanta.
   ``We're very interested in the Soviet Union,'' Monroe said.
   United has expressed interest in operating a Chicago-Moscow
route, said spokesman Rob Doughty.
   Under the new U.S.-Soviet accord, the two sides also agreed to
allow at least 100 annual charter flights over the North Atlantic
route and to consider as many as 100 charters across the Pacific.
   American tourists venturing beyond Moscow and Leningrad will
find wo historical museums in Minsk, the capital of the
Byelorussian republic, Mesiatsev said. Kiev, capital of the
Ukraine, offers monuments, parks and museums _ and the remains of
the Golden Gate, part of the old city's fortifications built in the
11th century.
   The Intourist official said Kiev's cuisine, which includes
borscht and ``galushky'' dumplings, is not to be missed. He
described Tbilisi as an industrial and cultural city full of old
churches.
   For the truly adventurous, there are the two Siberian cities.
Khabarovsk, in the southeast, is the final point on the
trans-Siberian railroad, with Mongolia and China beyond. Magadan,
like Khabarovsk an industrial city, has diamond mines.
   Riga, the Latvian capital on the Baltic, has a distinctive
culture and architecture, Mesiatsev noted. Like its fellow Baltic
republics of Lithuania and Estonia, Latvia has recently been
buffeted by nationalist stirrings.
   Pan Am charges $1,725 for a normal round-trip coach fare between
Washington and Moscow.
   The average Intourist package costs around $3,500 for a 12- to
14-day trip.

<HEAD>Group Seeks to Represent Eastern Pilots in Bargaining</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group seeking to replace the Air Line Pilots
Association as the representative of Eastern Air Lines pilots in
collective bargaining is pressing for an election to decide the
issue.
   The Eastern Pilots Association filed an application Tuesday with
the National Mediation Board in Washington and said it was seeking
immediate action on its request.
   ``Our organization better represents the real interests of the
men and women who are flying Eastern's planes every day,'' Thomas
Cooper, chairman of the EPA steering committee, said in a statement.
   ``The fairest way for the pilots of Eastern to determine the
destiny of their own careers and the future of Eastern is to have
an election,'' he said.
   Miami-based Eastern officially recognizes ALPA as the pilots'
bargaining agent. The group's membership includes an estimated
1,200 to 1,400 Eastern pilots who not now working.
   But Cooper said APLA has lost touch with Eastern's working
pilots. EPA claims to represent 93 percent of the airline's 1,775
flying pilots.
   Last year, ALPA called a sympathy strike against Eastern
management to back striking members of the Machinists union. Some
Eastern pilots continued to fly, and the airline hired replacements
for striking pilots.
   In a statement, ALPA spokesman Lou Baldwin said, ``Under the
Railway Labor Act, ALPA is the legal bargaining agent for all
Eastern pilots, and the actions taken today by the EPA do not in
any way affect that representation.''
   The airline had no comment, an Eastern spokesman said.

   After years of delay, Japanese electronics
companies received government approval today to sell digital audio
tape decks that can make virtually perfect copies of compact discs.
   The new decks' ability to make direct digital recordings of CDs
is expected to boost sales for the long-dormant and much-debated
recording medium.
   The approval from the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry was timed to allow manufacturers to introduce the machines
at the Chicago Consumer Electronics Show, which opens Saturday, the
officials said.
   Company officials said they were unsure until today's decision
whether they would be able to announce prices and marketing plans
for their DAT recorders at the show.
   Opposition to the technology continues in the United States
among song writers and record manufacturers concerned about
copyright protection. However, a bill pending in Congress that
would limit the number of copies that DAT recorders can make would
ease those concerns.
   Unlike analog tape recordings, digital recordings deteriorate
very little from generation to generation. Record manufacturers
therefore had feared DAT machines would result in a virtually
endless stream of high-quality copies of CDs that would cut into
their sales.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. spokesman Akira Nagano said
his company, which makes Panasonic equipment, might begin marketing
in the United States before the legislation is approved if
congressional action is delayed, since current laws do not prohibit
DATs.
   DAT decks have been sold in Japan and some parts of Europe since
1987. But in a concession to record companies, the equipment
currently on the market cannot make direct digital recordings of
CDs.
   Instead, they convert the high-quality digital signals on CDs to
analog signals and then reconvert them to digital form before
recording them, resulting in a slight loss in sound quality.
   That, combined with the high price of blank DAT tapes, which
cost almost as much as CDs, has held DAT sales far below initial
expectations.
   The biggest discord remaining in DAT's future may be its
still-high prices. DAT decks are expected to begin selling in the
United States for about $1,200.

   Genentech Inc. hopes to win
government approval for human tests of a genetically engineered
drug intended to clear the lungs of the deadly mucus produced by
cystic fibrosis.
   About 30,000 American children have cystic fibrosis, a
hereditary disease in which the lungs secrete large amounts of
thick mucus that impairs breathing and makes patients vulnerable to
infection. Most victims die by age 30.
   The Genentech drug, DNase, is a mass-produced version of a
natural human enzyme. Lab tests indicated that DNase, which will be
given in aerosol form, loosens lung secretions, said Dr. Steven
Shak, leader of the research team.
   Genentech also hopes DNase will let antibiotics reach and
destroy infection-causing bacteria and fight less serious but more
common lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, Shak said.
   Shak said Tuesday that Genentech has asked the Food and Drug
Administration to approve human testing of the drug. Approval could
come this year. Animal testing is not possible because no animal
has a disease like cystic fibrosis.
   Several years of testing may be required before the drug can go
into general use. The first stage of human testing will determine
its safety and give a preliminary indication of whether it works.

<HEAD>Brady Cautions Against Excess Concern About Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said
Wednesday that excess concern about inflation could hurt chances
for continued economic growth.
   But Britain's finance chief, John Major, said inflation remained
the ``main risk to continued growth and prosperity in our
economies.''
   The officials commented at the annual meeting of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which brings
together two dozen industrialized nations.
   The two-day meeting was expected to be dominated by efforts to
break a deadlock in the Uruguay Round trade talks, a four-year
drive to revamp the world trading system.
   However, Brady, Major and other finance chiefs offered a rundown
on the outlook for their economies at the meeting's opening session.
   Brady predicted the American economy would expand at a moderate
pace this year but pick up in 1991. He said that the price picture
will ``require continued vigilance.''
   But he cautioned, ``At the same time, we need to maintain a
balanced view of the inflation risk and not allow excess concern to
undermine the prospects for continued economic expansion.''
   Inflation has become a worry in the industrialized world, where
some fear it could bring to an end eight consecutive years of
economic expansion.
   In particular, some fear that price-conscious West Germany could
become the victim of higher inflation once it merges with East
Germany. A surge in consumer demand in East Germay could put upward
pressure on prices, some economists say.
   But West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann insisted his
country's influential central bank, the Bundesbank, would be solely
in charge of deciding monetary policy. He said the government
intended to keep the annual inflation rate at about 3 percent.
   Major, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, acknowledged that
rising prices remain a persistent problem for the British economy.
   ``The fact remains that inflation is too high, and accordingly
bringing it down must be, and is, the absolute priority of
policy,'' he told his colleagues at OECD headquarters in the
western part of Paris.
   He said the British government maintained a tight grip on
monetary policy and warned that interest rates could climb higher.
   The OECD, as part of the annual meeting, estimated economic
growth in its 24 member nations at a seasonally adjusted 2.9
percent this year and next. It was 3.6 percent last year.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills today made a
fresh pitch for progress in stalled trade talks, but European
officials resisted her call for immediate bargaining.
   ``The Americans made a serious mistake by trying to negotiate
here,'' said Frans Andriessen, the top trade official for the
12-nation European Community.
   Mrs. Hills wanted trade officials attending the annual meeting
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to
give a push to the stalled Uruguay Round trade talks, a four-year
effort to revamp the world trading system.
   But Andriessen said, ``This is not the negotiating place.''
Other countries, not attending the OECD meeting, have an interest
in the discussions, he said.
   Mrs. Hills reminded her colleagues in a speech to the opening
session of the OECD meeting that time was running short on reaching
agreement on new trading rules. The negotiations began in Uruguay
in 1986 and are due to conclude in Brussels in December.
   But a stubborn dispute between the United States and the
European Community over government payments to farmers has stalled
the talks.
   ``Agriculture is the linchpin of negotiations,'' Mrs. Hills said
in her speech.
   Shortly before today's meeting began, West German Economics
Minister Helmut Haussmann said the United States must ease its
demand that European officials scrap their costly subsidy programs
for farmers.
   The Bush administration wants the European Community to bring an
end to import barriers and export and domestic farm subsidies that
distort trade. The community has said it is cutting back on farm
payments but cannot eliminate them completely.
   The dispute has raised concern that the international trade
talks could end in failure.
   ``It's very important that the United States and the European
Community find a sort of mechanism that insures an overall
reduction of support prices,'' Haussmann told a breakfast meeting
of the Anglo-American press Association in Paris. ``That means the
United States will have to depart somehwat from its position.''
   He said the community ``will certainly agree to a substantial
reduction of support measures.''
   The negotiations involve some 100 nations and are attempting to
reduce barriers to trade in 15 areas. They include agriculture,
textiles and other manufactured goods, and services such as banking
and investment.
   Negotiators want to bring commerce in some of these areas under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for the first time.
GATT, a forum and an agreement for promoting freer trade, works to
curb unfair trading practices and lower trade barriers.
   The community provides assistance to its farmers through
guaranteed prices for many of their crops. It also gives exporters
help so more expensive European farm products can compete with
lower prices on the world market.
   Community officials argue that they have cut subsidies but say
they cannot get rid of their farm program entirely because many
small farmers depend on it for their livelihood.
   American officials also have run into trouble trying to get
Third World countries to back their ideas for tough rules to
prevent patent and copyright piracy.
   Poorer countries also are unhappy with a U.S. proposal to expand
GATT's market-opening rules to cover trade in services such as
banking, investment and insurance. American companies do well in
those fields and poor countries fear their infant industries would
be hurt.
   For their part, Third World countries want to tear down barriers
to trade in textile products. The United States, under pressure
from American textile groups, is pushing for a less comprehensive
reduction of existing tariffs and quotas. Trade in textiles isn't
covered by GATT rules but instead is regulated by the Multi-Fiber
Agreement, an accord of some 80 nations.
   Mrs. Hills and other officials want to advance the trade talks
so a preliminary agreement can be reached in some areas at a July
23 session in Geneva.
   OECD members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States and West Germany.

   Prices climbed higher on Wall Street today as
momentum from Tuesday's big advance carried over to another day.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which surged nearly 50 points
and closed at a new high on Tuesday, was up another 14.00 to
2,884.49 as of 10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of 7 to 3
with, 704 stocks rising, 290 falling and 500 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume came to 35.40 million shares after the first half-hour of
trading.
   Analysts had expected a late buying burst on Tuesday to continue
into the early part of today's session, but said it remained to be
seen whether the market could hold its gains, especially with the
Dow Jones average approaching the 2,900 barrier.
   The government reported today that its main economic forecasting
gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, slipped 0.2
percent in April, its second loss in four months and another
indication of the nation's sluggish economy.
   Analysts said the news was in line with market expectations and
gave a boost to bond prices, which in turn helped support the stock
market.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up $2.50 for each
$1,000 in face amount in early trading.
   The most-actively traded issue on the NYSE was Torchmark, down &lsqb;
at 46\.
   Technology stocks, which were the standouts Tuesday, were up
again in the early going today. IBM rose &lsqb; to 119~ on the NYSE,
while Adobe Systems rose &rsqb; to 38\ and Intel was up &rsqb; to 49 in
over-the-counter trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 0.75 to
197.32. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
gained 1.24 to 363.80.
   Prices rebounded on Tuesday following a 35-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrials on Friday. The industrial average gained 49.57 to
close at 2,870.49, surpassing the index's previous high of
2,856.26, set last Wednesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 11
to 4 on the NYSE, with 1,107 up, 427 down and 454 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 137.41 million shares, against 120.25
million in the previous session.

   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge slipped 0.2 percent in April, its second loss in four months
and another indication of the nation's sluggish economy, the
Commerce Department said today.
   The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months in advance, had risen 1.0
percent in March to regain February's 1.0 percent loss. The index
was unchanged in January.
   A slight increase in the average workweek caused the department
to revise the March figure up from 0.9 percent.
   Analysts had said in advance of the report that the economy had
started the second quarter at the same weak pace that it ran in the
first quarter and would improve only slightly in the second half of
the year.
   The economy grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the first
quarter and many economists expect it to advance only 2.0 percent
for the entire year, down from 3.0 percent last year and 4.4
percent in 1988.
   In a second report today illustrating the economic sluggishness,
the department said new home sales fell 1.6 percent in April, their
fifth consecutive monthly decline to their lowest level since the
recession year of 1982.
   The National Association of Realtors, which monitors existing
home sales, said last Friday that resales of single-family homes
slipped 2.1 percent in April, their third drop in four months
although sales were unchanged in March.
   Bush administration and congressional budget negotiators had
their eyes on the reports since continued growth would be required
for any reduction in the federal deficit.
   A recession would mean a loss of jobs and lower personal
incomes, diminished corporate profits and thus a drop in tax
revenues. At the same time, the government would be called on to
spend more on benefits.
   Analysts had expected a slight dip in today's leading indicators
report, in part because of a continuing decline in the number of
building permits in April. Permits have fallen each month since
January, when builders sought to take advantage of record warm
weather and to beat a deadline for meeting expensive new building
standards.
   Many analysts foresee no immediate improvement in the
construction industry in view of high interest rates and tighter
restrictions on credit.
   In addition to building permits, five more of the 11
forward-looking statistics were negative.
   They included a drop in new plant and equipment orders, a
decline in the average workweek, a decrease in orders for consumer
goods, a drop in manufacturers' unfilled orders and an increase in
weekly unemployment claims. Four of the components were positive:
an increase in the price of raw materials, an index measuring
consumer confidence, slower business delivery times and an increase
in the money supply.
   Stock prices were unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 144.9 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and down 0.6 percent from its level a year ago.
   Economists Bruce Steinberg and Laurie Allen contended in advance
of today's report that ``the latest batch of indicators provided
further evidence of a lackluster economy.''
   Writing in Merrill Lynch Capital Markets' ``Weekly Economic &amp;
Financial Commentary,'' they pointed to reports last week showing
continued sluggishness in the automobile industry and flat orders
since the first of the year for durable goods _ usually expensive
products expected to last at least three years.
   Steinberg and Allen also pointed out that the first-quarter
gross national product _ the broadest measure of the nation's
economic health _ was sharply revised downward, from 2.1 percent
originally estimated to just 1.3 percent in last week's report.
   ``Like other indicators released during the past month, the
latest set of data probably understate economic momentum,'' they
added. ``But they amply illustrate that the economy is going
nowhere fast.''
   While the GNP grew at its slowest pace since 1986 from January
through March, it contained what Robert G. Dederick, chief
economist with the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, described as
``the seeds of a pickup.''
   The downward revision was attributed almost solely to a
reduction in inventories, Dederick explained, which could provide
for expanded second-quarter growth as businesses begin to refill
their shelves and backlots.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist with the Boston Co., said
second-quarter economic information ``so far depicts a soft
economy.''
   ``But if sales and demand stay up, the economy will continue to
expand ... closer to 2 percent.''
   Three recent surveys show other analysts also expect the economy
to grow 2 percent this year, down from 3 percent last year and 4.4
percent in 1988. They were conducted by the Business Council, the
National Association of Business Economists and Blue Chip Economic
Indicators of Sedona, Ariz.

   Four years after it was completed and 14
years after construction began, the Seabrook plant has supplied
nuclear-generated electricity to New England customers for the
first time.
   The plant was operating at 15 percent capacity and producing
enough electricity to supply 65,000 homes when it was hooked into
the New England power grid Tuesday night, officials said.
   The milestone occurred during tests to ready the $6.5 billion
plant for full commercial operation by mid-summer. At full power,
Seabrook will generate 1,150 megawatts, enough for 1 million homes.
   Spokesman Rob Williams said today power had been increased to
about 20 percent, producing about 120 megawatts.
   After increasing to about 215 megawatts and producing power into
mid-afternoon, Williams said the plant would be disconnected from
the New England power grid so equipment could be tested. Then it
will be reconnected to the grid and the reactor brought to about 30
percent capacity.
   Seabrook has become a symbol of the nuclear industry's troubles
and a target of anti-nuclear activists. Construction began in 1976
and took 10 years. Even the, the plant was unable to get an
operating license until March.
   Because of delays, costs soared from less than $1 billion and
forced the plant's lead owner, Public Service Company of New
Hampshire, into bankruptcy court in 1988.
   Oponents contend the plant is unsafe and the evacuation plan for
the surrounding area inadequate.
   The plant produced electricity during tests in 1985, but that
was non-nuclear power generated by using the system's heater and
pumps.

<HEAD>Auto Journal Says Ford to Offer Big Year-End Incentives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will offer big incentives later
this year to make room for 1991 models, an automotive journal says.
   This week's editions of Automotive News said Ford has told
dealers it plans to offer incentives up to $1,500 on selected 1990
cars once the 1991 models get into showrooms in force.
   Ford already has begun selling some 1991 cars and trucks,
including the Ford Escort subcompact and the Ford Explorer
sport-utility vehicle. Year-end sales aren't unusual in the auto
industry, but such early word of how they may be conducted is.
   Early word of the incentive plan may torpedo some sales now,
since consumers may wait for bigger incentives later.
   Ford spokesman Bill Carroll was in a today and unavailable for
immediate comment.
   Earlier this month, Ford's financial vice president, David
McCammon, said the automaker spent about $1,000 per vehicle, or
about $4 billion overall, on incentives last year. He said the
company was trimming that cost this year.
   He also said new car and truck inventories were in good shape at
between 60 to 65 selling days. Ford, General Motors Corp. and
Chrysler Corp. have scheduled production increases in the third
quarter.
   Some industry observers have said the manufacturing boost is a
hedge against a possible United Auto Workers strike. UAW contracts
with each of the Big Three automakers expire Sept. 14. If there is
no strike, inventories of late 1990 and early 1991 cars and trucks
could swell.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts say the market continues to reflect concerns about the
weather. There is less rain in the forecast, which could allow
fields to dry enough to allow the planting of corn.
   Soybean planting has also been delayed, as shown by figures from
Illinois, where plantings are 17 percent completed. Over the past
five years, plantings are usually 81 percent compete by this time.
   Weather may also impact wheat futures. Rain delays to the hard
red winter wheat harvest could occur in some areas.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.34 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to

increased over the possibilty of decreased demand as the weather
warms.
   Hog futures slumped as profit-taking set in after Tuesday's
sharp rise in prices. But the run-up in frozen pork belly futures
in Tuesday's trading continued as traders reacted to light movement

<HEAD>Newspapers Would Have to Use Recycled Paper Under New Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's toughest newspaper recycling
law has been approved in Suffolk County on Long Island, where all
major papers will be required to use 40 percent recycled newsprint
in their editions by the end of 1996.
   The measure, which was approved Tuesday by a 12 to 6 vote in the
county Legislature, was criticized by a group representing 64 daily
papers in the state. The supporters of the bill would be able to
override a veto by County Executive Patrick Halpin.
   ``Any use of recycled paper should be market driven,'' said John
Kutzer, executive director of the New York Newspaper Publishers
Association. ``We feel local government is perhaps going overboard
with these requirements.''
   The law would apply to all daily and weekly newspapers printed,
sold, or distributed in Suffolk County, provided their Suffolk
circulation is 20,000 or more a week. Advertising circulars are
included if they meet the same circulation requirement.
   The bill would require that newspapers be printed on stock
containing at least 40 percent recycled paper by Dec. 31, 1996.
Compliance would be phased in in yearly steps.
   Papers which did not comply would face a $500 fine each day.
   Legislator Maxine Postal, D-Amityville, sponsored the bill,
saying the measure would ease the pressure on Long Island landfills
and incinerators.
   ``If the country does not move to resolve this problem, our most
famous product next to the F-14 is going to be garbage,'' said Ms.
Postal.
   Publishers complained there is just a single plant in the
Northeast which supplies recycled paper, and the next one is not
due to open until 1993.
   But Postal said paper manufacturers would retool to provide
adequate supplies of recycled paper once publishers were willing to
commit to long-term contracts.
   The publisher of Newsday, the largest circulation daily on Long
Island, was opposed to the Suffolk plan and plans to challenge the
law in court, said spokesman Sam Ruinsky. Newsday presently uses 17
percent recycled paper for printing.
   William K. Adler, manager of corporate relations for The New
York Times, cited a voluntary agreement approved by the publishers
association in which they agreed to gradually increase the use of
recycled paper. That plan set a goal of 40 percent by the year 2000.
   ``Since the state has initiated a coordinated program, attempts
by individual counties to legislate their own timetables for
recycled newsprint are counterproductive,'' said Adler.
   The Times is currently using 8 percent recycled fiber, he said.

   SmithKline Beecham announced Wednesday it
has agreed to sell its European cosmetics businesses to a West
German firm for $358 million.
   Completion of the sale of the Margaret Astor and Lancaster
subsidiaries, which manufacture skin care and decorative cosmetics
and fragrances, to John. A. Benckiser GmbH of West Germany is
subject to approval of the Cartel Office in the German Federal
Republic.
   It is expected to take place in a month.
   The firms being sold had sales of $426 million last year and
profits of $32 million.
   In December Benckiser bought SmithKline's Household Products
business in the U.S. and Canada for $106 million.
   Benckiser, which had 1989 sales of $1.6 billion, sells Calgon
water softner, Cling Free anti-static dryer sheets, Jet-Dry
dishwasher rinse agent and other consumer products.
   Last month SmithKline Beecham sold its Yardley-Lentheric
cosmetics business for $182 million to Old Bond Street Corp.
   With the latest transaction SmithKline said it has realized
$1.68 billion from its planned divestitures, most of it in cash.
The company has been reorganizing to focus on what it sees as its
key businesses, such as pharmaceuticals, since Philadelphia-based
SmithKline Beckman and London-based Beecham merged last year.
   Besides the cosmetics and households subsidiaries, SmithKline
has sold its Ambrosia, Bovril and Marmite food brands for $257
million and 32 U.S. over-the-counter specialty products for $53
million.
   It said discussions are continuing to sell some nonstrategic
human and animal pharmaceutical products, and the Yardley-Lentharic
operation in South Africa.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Pistor, who serves on the boards of some
of America's largest corporations, has resigned as chairman of a
small Dallas bank, a post he had taken after leaving the huge First
RepublicBank Corp. shortly before it failed.
   Pistor, a former vice chairman of First RepublicBank Corp. and
past president of the American Bankers Association, said Tuesday
that he decided to leave NorthPark National Bank because of the
bank's past financial difficulties and Texas' slumping economy have
prevented the expansion planned when he took the helm in April 1988.
   ``The reasons I was hired were obvious, to enhance the franchise
in the sense of making a much bigger organization with acquisitions
... and to increase private banking. Those opportunities are still
in front of the bank but I don't expect them to happen right
away,'' Pistor said.
   NorthPark is a retail and commercial bank owned by Dallas
developer Raymond Nasher. Although serving mainly upscale North
Dallas neighborhoods, NorthPark has had its share of problem loans.
The $700 million bank posted an $8.2 million loss in 1988 and a
$6.1 million loss in 1989. But the bank, which received a $10
million injection of capital from Nasher last year, was profitable
in the first quarter of 1990.
   Pistor also serves on the boards of Southern Methodist
University, the Meadows Foundation and Dallas-based Centex Corp.
and Oryx Energy Co.; Fort Worth-based AMR Corp.; and New York-based
American Brands.
   Pistor left First RepublicBank just months before its banks were
seized by regulators in July 1988 and sold to NCNB Texas National
Bank.

<HEAD>A Decade's Eye View of Work Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some economic analysts view events by the month,
others by the year and a very few by the decade, which is probably
the least publicized but most revealing study of all.
   A decade review puts into perspective all those little blips on
the trend line that cause excitement for a day or so or at most a
week. What is revealed may be the true underlying direction of
change.
   Following those longer trend lines, F. Thomas Juster, research
scientist at the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center,
traces lifestyle patterns during the 1980s and follows them through
some unusual twists and turns.
   Example: Real hourly earnings during the 1980s fell from growth
rates of around 3 percent a year in the 1950s and 1960s to less
than 1 percent in the 1970s and 1980s.
   That decline, however, can't be demonstrated by certain other
sets of data. Why not? Because, says Juster, while earnings per
hour of work have almost stagnated for close to 20 years, total
earnings have grown substantially.
   What seems to be a contradiction, however, is readily explained.
What occurred, says Juster in a paper, ``is that total earnings
have grown substantially because total hours of work have grown,
especially for women.''
   But doesn't that seem to be at odds with a popular belief, that
Americans have become more leisure oriented? Not so, says Juster,
who explains ``while total work hours in the market have grown,
work hours in total have declined.''
   Just a minute, you say, that doesn't make sense. But it does
after Juster explains that while people might have spent more time
on the job, that is, working for money, they spent less time
working at home.
   Well, the women did, anyway. It was a slightly different story
for men.
   Juster found that for most people, especially those between ages
25 and 44, the amount of time spent working for pay in the market
and that spent at unpaid household work moved in different
directions for men and women.
   Women spent less time at home and more in the marketplace. Men
spent less time in the market and more time at home.
   If that's so, was the much-touted leisure generation a myth? No,
it wasn't.
   ``Leisure time for both men and women has increased during the
1980s compared to earlier decades, and has in fact shown a steady
increase since the 1960s,'' says Juster.
   And where did this leisure time come from if women went to work
in the marketplace and men had to do more chores at home?
   The answer, apparently, is that while the time spent on
household chores by women, especially young women, diminished
sharply, the added time men spent on household tasks rose only
modestly.
   The added leisure time, that is, came right out of the home, and
that leaves some puzzling questions:
   Are men more efficient than women at household chores? Did
household chores not get done? Was the need for less attention to
household chores a result of more efficient houses and equipment to
run them?
   The answers weren't in Juster's research paper.

<HEAD>Construction Index Hits Four-Year Low</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts for new construction declined 6
percent in April, reaching a four-year low and resuming a slide
that began late last year, the F.W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill
Inc. reported Wednesday.
   The decline was blamed on a credit crunch affecting commercial
and residential builders.
   ``Events of the past six months have changed the character of
the construction sector from stable to vulnerable,'' said George A.
Christie, chief economist at F.W. Dodge.
   He said tight credit for builders had become a bigger problem
than mortgage rates, which he described as ``workable.''
   ``The current rate of contracting, which is only about 85
percent of what it was last fall, seems to bear out the concern
that we've been getting an overreaction by bankers to the
regulatory clampdown on high-risk real estate lending practices,''
Christie said.
   That clampdown was precipitated by the crisis in the savings and
loan industry.
   The Dodge index, which uses 1982 as its base of 100, dropped to
146 in April from 156 in March. The last time the index was lower
than 146 was in January 1986 when it reached 145. With the
exception of a 3 percent increase in March, the index has been
declining since it peaked at 181 in September.
   The yearly pace of total contracting was $230.2 million last
month, down from March's $245.5 million.
   Non-residential building set the pace with a 12 percent drop in
April. Homebuilding construction dropped 4 percent in April, while
public works and utilities projects increased 1 percent.
   For the first four months of 1990, construction contracting
trailed the first four months of 1989 by 9 percent.
   The Northeast continued its decline of recent months by dropping
27 percent compared with the first four months of last year. The
South trailed the pace set in 1989 by 11 percent. The West held
even with last year's contracting through April and the North
Central, leading last year by 5 percent, was the only region to
show improvement in the first four months of 1990.

   Aetna Life and Casualty Co., which
earlier this month announced it would pull out of Pennsylvania's
car-insurance market, has suspended its departure pending the
outcome of a rate case before the state Insurance Department.
   Under an agreement with the Casey administration, which was
announced Tuesday, the company also said it will rescind notices
sent to customers notifying them their policies would not be
renewed.
   As its part of the agreement, the state agreed to rule within
two weeks on Aetna's request to sidestep rate rollbacks in the
state's new car insurance law, which takes effect July 1 and
requires premium cuts of at least 10 percent for all drivers.
   If approved, the company's proposal would result in rate
increases for the majority of its 200,000 policyholders. Aetna
spokesman John C. Hawkins said the company would not rule out any
options, including withdrawal from the state, if the department
rejects its request.
   Aetna, the state's fifth largest car insurer, announced May 9
its intent to leave the state, claiming the new law would preclude
its ability to make a profit. The law calls for rate cuts of 10
percent for all drivers and at least 22 percent for drivers who
give up their right to sue in most cases.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey and Hawkins said the agreement signaled a
lessening of hostilities between the company and the state. Aetna
had filed suit against the law; the state later named Aetna in a
suit. The agreement will not affect the pending litigation.
   Casey said the agreement was another step toward getting the new
law in place by July 1. He said 155 of the state's 223 car
insurance companies, or about two-thirds, had filed rates in
compliance with the law, although 41 of those are seeking
exemptions from mandatory rate rollbacks.
   ``It's good news. It's real progress,'' Casey said, referring to
the agreement with Aetna.
   Some of the state's largest insurers _ Allstate, State Farm and
Erie _ have yet to file reduced rates under the law.
   Last week, the state granted exemptions to Keystone Insurance
Co. and Colonial Penn Insurance Co. For Keystone customers that
retain their full right to sue, rates will be boosted by 3 percent;
other customers would see cuts of about 11 percent. Colonial Penn's
rates would be cut by an average of 5.4 percent for those who
retain the right to sue and cut 18 percent for others.
   Casey said those rulings recognized that the new law would have
taken too large a chunk out of the companies' profit margin. He
said that in the ``vast majority of cases,'' drivers in
Pennsylvania could expect the full 10 percent or 22 percent cuts.

<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. on Wednesday announced the
appointment of Anthony S. D'Amato to the vacant posts of president
and chief operating officer.
   D'Amato, 59, also was elected to Borden's board of directors.
The appointments are effective July 1.
   ``Mr. D'Amato's promotion is an important step in preparation
for an orderly succession,'' Borden Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer R.J. Ventres said in a news release.
   Ventres said D'Amato's ``distinguished 31-year career at Borden
has provided him with broad experience in both consumer and
industrial product businesses to apply to the company's future
growth.''
   Ventres, 65, is due to retire at the end of 1991.
   The pattern at Borden has been that the president and COO is the
successor when the chairman and CEO retires, spokesman Nicholas R.
Iammartino said.
   D'Amato has served in various capacities during his Borden
career. He succeeded Ventres as an executive vice president and
president of the chemical division in 1985.
   Joseph M. Saggese was elected an executive vice president of the
company and president of the worldwide packaging and industrial
products division, succeeding D'Amato.
   Borden, the country's biggest dairy products company, also makes
other foods and non-food consumer items ranging from glue to
wallcoverings. It also manufactures industrial products, including
chemicals and plastics.
   The company has its corporate headquarters in New York.

   Deere &amp; Co. elevated its president Hans W.
Becherer to company chairman Wednesday, succeeding Robert A.
Hanson, who is retiring.
   Becherer, 55, also retains the position of chief executive
officer, to which he was named in August. Hanson, 65, had announced
his retirement as chairman effective Friday.
   Deere's board of directors also promoted three other top company
officials.
   ``This newly elected leadership ... is the same group of
executives who have been actively involved in the development of
the current strategic focus of Deere &amp; Co.,'' said spokesman Robert
J. Combs.
   John E. McGinty, an analyst with New York-based First Boston
Corp., said the management changes were expected. He said the
significant move came when Becherer was named chief executive
officer.
   Among other changes, the farm and heavy equipment manufacturer's
board named David H. Stowe Jr., 53, as president and chief
operating officer. Stowe has served as Deere's executive vice
president for worldwide agricultural equipment and consumer
products.
   Bill C. Harpole, 56, was elected to succeed Stowe, while
Harpole's former job of senior vice president for the worldwide
parts and logistics division went to Bernard L. Hardiek, 50, who
has been Deere's vice president for business development, planning
and taxation.
   ``Under Bob Hanson's guidance, Deere &amp; Co. met the tremendous
challenges of the 1980s in our major market, the U.S. farm economy,
and emerged as a stronger, more productive organization,'' Becherer
said in a statement.
   ``We look forward to the challenge of extending Deere &amp; Co.'s
long history of leadership and excellence.''
   Becherer joined Deere in 1962 and served in various posts
covering operations in Europe, Latin America, Australia and the Far
East.
   He joined the company's board of directors in February 1986 and
was elected president and chief operating officer in April 1987. He
was elected president and chief executive officer in August 1989.
   In the past fiscal year, which ended Oct. 31, Deere had net
income of $380 million on revenue of $7.2 billion. The company has
plants in eight countries.

<HEAD>State Department Says `Nyet' to AT&amp;T Plan For New U.S.-Soviet
Phone Link</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department opposes an American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plan to use the Soviet Intersputnik
satellite system to increase long-distance calls between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
   The department, in a letter to Federal Communications Commission
Chairman Alfred Sikes, said there was insufficient reason to
deviate from existing U.S. policy that requires most satellite
telephone traffic between the two countries to be carried by the
119-nation Intelsat satellite cooperative.
   In December, AT&amp;T asked the FCC for permission to use an
Intersputnik satellite located above the west coast of Africa to
try to keep pace with a large increase in U.S.-Soviet phone traffic.
   AT&amp;T said in a letter to President Bush that calling between the
two countries increased by more than 140 percent in the past two
years as East-West relations improved.
   The company said demand still far exceeded capacity, and it
sought FCC permission to nearly triple telecommunications capacity
between the two nations.
   But Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said there
were insufficient foreign policy reasons to give AT&amp;T permission to
shift some future traffic away from Intelsat.
   Eagleburger, however, in his May 14 letter to the FCC, said the
State Department would support use of Intersputnik for services not
interconnected with the public, switched phone network, such as
data transmission.
   An FCC decision is pending.
   Intelsat spokesman Tony Trujillo said Thursday it wasn't true
that Intelsat didn't have the capacity to meet the demand for
U.S.-Soviet calling.
   However, Charles Miller, AT&amp;T vice president for federal
government affairs, said the issue wasn't Intelsat's capacity but
the Soviet Union's problem of buying additional space on Intelsat
because the ruble isn't traded officially in international money
markets.
   ``The principal concern was ... the hard currency problem,'' he
said.
   Miller said the United States has 56 circuits to the Soviet
Union, about the same as for Iceland, a country with about 0.1
percent of the Soviet population.
   AT&amp;T, which handles more than 80 percent of all U.S.
international telephone calling, has the only Western phone
facilities to the Soviet Union. The traffic is carried on undersea
cable, land lines and by Intelsat. Other long-distance companies
lease space on the AT&amp;T circuits.
   AT&amp;T said it would need to build a new satellite earth station
near Catawissa, Pa., to connect with the Intersputnik satellite.

   Prices moved moderately higher on Wall Street
today as buying from Tuesday's big gains carried over to another
day and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to new highs.
   The Dow Jones average, which soared nearly 50 points and reached
a new closing high Tuesday, rose 6.88 to 2,877.37 as of 3 p.m. EDT.
The average, which was up more than 16 points earlier in the day,
fluctuated as some profit-taking set in.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 8
to 7 with 805 stocks rising, 675 falling and 508 unchanged on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume came to a moderate 164.59 million shares with one hour of
trading left.
   Analysts had expected Tuesday's surge to continue into today's
session but also said it remained to be seen whether the market
could hold its gains _ especially with the Dow Jones average
approaching the 2,900 barrier.
   The government reported today that its main economic forecasting
gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, slipped 0.2
percent in April, its second loss in four months and another
indication of the nation's sluggish economy.
   Analysts said the news was in line with market expectations and
gave a boost to bond prices, which in turn helped support the stock
market.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up about $2.18 for
each $1,000 in face amount.
   The most-actively traded issue on the NYSE was First Bank
System, up &rsqb; to 15&lsqb;.
   Among blue chip issues, IBM was up 1| to 121&rsqb;, General Electric
fell &rsqb; to 69&rsqb;, and Philip Morris was off 1&lsqb; to 42{.
   Technology stocks led Wall Street on Tuesday, but today's gains
were more evenly spread among the market, said Jack Barbanel,
president of First Global Asset Management Inc.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 0.13 to
196.70. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
gained 0.55 to 363.11.
   Prices rebounded on Tuesday following a 35-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrials on Friday. The industrial average gained 49.57 to
close at 2,870.49, surpassing the index's previous high of
2,856.26, set last Wednesday. the previous session.

   Marine Midland Bank has agreed to sell Barclays
Bank PLC its international private banking business, which
primarily operates in Latin America, the two banks announced
Wednesday.
   Marine Midland's decision to sell is part of a strategy to focus
on retail banking through its 317 branches in New York state,
Geoffrey A. Thompson, president and chief executive of Marine
Midland, said in a press release.
   Marion J. Cotrone, a spokeswoman for Barclays, said the bank
already does business in Latin America, but the acquisition of
Marine Midland's operations is an opportunity to expand Barclays'
client base.
   Terms of the agreement, which is expected to be completed in
August, were not disclosed.
   Tony Mattera, a Marine Midland spokesman, said he could not
discuss the specific size of Marine Midland's international banking
arm, but said: ``It's not insignificant, but on the other hand it's
not a giant business.''
   Marine Midland's holding company, Honkong and Shanghai Banking
Corp. Ltd., also known as HongkongBank, also handles international
private banking from the United States, he said.
   Barclays, headquartered in London, operates branches in more
than 70 countries. The bank had $205 billion in assets at the end
of 1989.
   Hongkong and Shanghai had assets of $133 billion.

   Honda announced Wednesday it will expand
its research and development operation in a $27 million project.
   The company said construction of the 81,000-square-foot facility
next to the Transportation Research Center and near the company's
Marysville operations in west-central Ohio is to begin in August
and be completed next year.
   Masaru Otabe, president of Honda R&amp;D North America, said the
expansion ``continues Honda's strategy to become a self-reliant
motor vehicle company in the United States.''
   The company said the new facilities will increase Honda's
ability to assist U.S. suppliers in developing parts of Honda
products made in the United States and Canada.
   The first Honda product to be designed, developed and engineered
in the United States is the 1991 Accord Wagon. It is to be made
exclusively in the United States and be exported to world markets.
   ``This represents the beginning of a major investment in what I
see as R&amp;D development in Ohio,'' Gov. Richard Celeste said at a
news conference.
   Celeste said the state will make grants available to Honda to
train new employees at the center. But he said he could not yet say
how much money the state will provide.
   Honda R&amp;D North America has 300 employees nationwide. With the
expansion, it expects total employment to reach about 500.
   Honda's research activities started in California in 1975. The
Los Angeles center is responsible for market research and analysis,
product planning and styling design.
   The Ohio center began operation in 1985. It is responsible for
development, prototype fabrication, testing and support of North
American suppliers.
   The Transportation Research Center is a 7,500-acre complex that
provides research, development and testing services and facilities
to companies and government agencies involved in transportation.
   Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. bought the TRC property from
the state of Ohio in 1988. But the independent TRC Inc. operates
the center through Ohio State University and has other clients
besides Honda.

<HEAD>Inventor Says He Has Developed 3-D TV</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An inventor said Wednesday he has developed
three-dimensional television, beating the world's electronics
giants.
   ``We think that just as black and white was converted into
color, so will color be converted into 3-D,'' said the 33-year-old
British inventor, James Ashbey.
   The technology does not require special glasses or screens. It
can convert all new and existing black and white and color films
into 3-D, along with live broadcasts, animation and computer
graphics, said his company, Delta Group.
   Ashbey displayed his invention at a London studio, showing color
films in what he calls ``full natural perspective.''
   The effect appears three dimensional, but it loses some
resolution compared with a standard TV image, and is very blurry.
Ashbey did not display the 3-D and normal television versions of
the same film side-by-side for comparison.
   Ashbey said he has applied for an international patent for his
invention, which he calls ``Deep Vision.''
   He said he developed the technology with financial support from
RCA-Columbia Pictures International, which he said provided
$245,000, and the British entertainment group Brent Walker Holdings
PLC, which he said provided $642,200.
   Deep Vision electronically stimulates the brain into creating an
illusion, he said.
   The technology takes a normal film, makes a digital version and
inserts what Ashbey calls stereo cues. A digital decoder added to
an ordinary television set then uses these cues to send slightly
different images to each eye, and that creates the experience of
depth, he said.

<HEAD>Sir John Harvey-Jones, Star British Businessman, Fights the
Stereotype</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessmen don't get no respect in Britain.
   Sir John Harvey-Jones has turned himself into a national
celebrity by trying to do something about that.
   ``I think we have an anti-industrial bias in this country and
have had for many years,'' said the former chairman of Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC, one of the largest British manufacturers.
   ``People think that business is just about money and figures and
that management is about administration and bureaucracy,'' he said.
``I actually think that business is about the totality of life and
finally about people.''
   Since before the time Charles Dickens created Ebenezer Scrooge,
ordinary Britons often have regarded businessmen as money-grubbing
exploiters. The strength of Britain's socialist opposition Labor
Party partly reflects an enduring contempt for capitalist role
models.
   Harvey-Jones, 66, has bucked the stereotype. He is widely
admired for turning Imperial Chemical into a multinational giant
with products that range from artificial carpet fiber to household
paints.
   Contrary to the arrogance and aloofness commonly ascribed to
many British business types, Harvey-Jones looks like a friendly
buccaneer, with collar-length hair, shaggy mustache and beefy frame.
   He goes for loud, expensive ties, drives a donkey trap around
his 13th century manor house and boasts a flare for cooking curry.
   Perhaps another reason Harvey-Jones defies the British executive
image is his political leaning. He's not enamored with Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has alienated many working
people with her strident free enterprise strategies that have
reshaped Britain's economy this past decade.
   ``I believe that our society has become more divisive in the
past 10 years rather than less,'' Harvey-Jones said.
   Thatcher doesn't much care for Harvey-Jones either. The British
press says he's her least favorite industrialist.
   But the Independent newspaper has called him the Field Marshal
Montgomery of Manufacturing, referring to Britain's World War II
hero, Viscount Montgomery. ``He runs on the same mixture of surface
flamboyance and underlying caution,'' the newspaper said.
   Harvey-Jones' latest effort to win Britons over to the
industrialists' side was a six-part BBC-TV series called
``Troubleshooter.'' In it, he called on businesses ranging from a
pottery to a carmaker, helping solve problems.
   Although the documentary-style program looked like a course on
basic management, it was a surprise hit, attracting between 2
million and 3 million viewers each week.
   ``I hoped in the series that we would be able to give a
different perspective on what businessmen actually do, the sort of
problems they are trying to deal with, and the reasons why
management is, I think, a very worthwhile career and a very
important career,'' Harvey-Jones said.
   ``A well-organized, well-functioning, efficient factory gives me
the same pleasure, albeit in a different way, as when I go into a
very nicely tended garden,'' he said.
   Harvey-Jones is the only child of an Army captain who later
served as a hired prime minister to under-age maharajahs in India.
He led a pampered childhood and once had his own ceremonial
elephant.
   He was wrenched away at age 6 and sent to the Tormore boarding
school in Kent, England, attended the Royal Naval College at
Dartmouth when he was 13 and served in the Navy during World War
II. He spent a dozen years in Navy intelligence doing secret work
that won him the Order of the British Empire.
   At age 32 he joined Imperial Chemical Industries as trainee,
rose through management for nearly four decades and became chairman
in 1982.
   The company had just reported its first quarterly loss.
Harvey-Jones funneled money into the company's growth areas and cut
back on the poorly performing plastics, fiber and petrochemicals
business.
   Imperial Chemical turned profitable again within two years. The
reversal became part of the reason Harvey-Jones was awarded with
knighthood in 1985.
   He retired from Imperial Chemical in 1987, and has taken on
about 32 part-time paid and unpaid jobs since, ranging from charity
events to his BBC series.
   Harvey-Jones is a director of several major British companies as
well as the Economist magazine and he is Chancellor of Bradford
University.
   ``I think the day when you stop doing anything and you just lie
back in your deck chair, you're ready for your box,'' Harvey-Jones
said during a recent interview at the Mayfair, a posh London hotel
favored by rock stars.
   His accessibility is unusual in a country where most executives
are tight-lipped and publicity shy.
   ``I'm probably better known than most,'' Harvey-Jones said, but
``if the best you can do is to have a sort of old-age pensioner as
a business hero, I think we're in trouble.''
   Harvey-Jones blamed Britain's anti-business attitudes partly on
what he called the bias of the national education system, which
exalts professions such as medicine and dramatic arts but seems to
steer students clear of business careers. Few of Britain's managers
are trained, he said.
   ``There is still a very considerable degree of snobbery in this
country. People are judged by their birth and are judged by the
type of career they follow. Certainly, business success in this
country doesn't open doors for you,'' he said.
   Harvey-Jones lives in Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire in central
west England, with his wife, daughter and 17-year-old
granddaughter. He has a reputation for cooking ferocious curries, a
talent he picked up in India.
   ``I enjoy it because it's a creative thing,'' he said. ``I tend
to be a big man with the onion and the garlic.'

<TEXT>
   First American Corp., Tennessee's
largest bank holding company, remains strong despite the firing of
its top executive and a recent loss, the chairman of its executive
committee says.
   First American, which has 140 branches across the state, fired
Kenneth L. Roberts, it chairman, president and chief executive
officer, in th wake of a first-quarter loss of $44.8 million.
   ``Despite recent problems, First American remains a strong
company with ample capital and liquidity,'' executive committee
Chairman David K. Wilson said in a statement release Tuesday after
Roberts was fired.
   Roberts, 57, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. An
employee of his who answered the telephone at the Roberts home said
Roberts was out of town.
   In a statement released by the bank, Roberts said:
   ``While I am proud of many achievements during the past 14
years, certainly I am not pleased with our current performance. As
we effect this change in leadership, let me express my appreciation
to our shareholders, directors, customers and employees for their
past support,'' he said.
   Roberts will continue to receive his salary and other benefits
for the next four years, totaling more than $1.5 million. He was
recently listed by Forbes magazine as one of the nation's
highest-paid executives.
   First American Vice Chairman James F. Smith Jr. was elected to
succeed Roberts on a interim basis as chairman, president and chief
executive officer.
   The $44.8 million loss came after a profit of only $4.2 million
for all of last year. The losses came after federal regulators
completed a special examination of real estate loans.

   Prices advanced moderately on Wall Street today,
with the Dow Jones industrial average reaching yet another closing
high, as buying from Tuesday's big advance continued into a second
session.
   The average gained 8.07 to finish at 2,878.56, eclipsing the
previous high of 2,870.49, set only one day before.
   Analysts had expected Tuesday's surge _ in which the Dow Jones
industrials gained nearly 50 points _ to spill over into today's
session. They also questioned whether the market could hold its
gains, especially with the Dow Jones average approaching the 2,900
barrier.
   The average fluctuated during the session and dipped into minus
territory late in the day as higher prices triggered
computer-program sell orders. But the market, continuing to show
resilience, repeatedly shook off the declines.
   The government reported today that its main economic forecasting
gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, slipped 0.2
percent in April, its second loss in four months and another
indication of the nation's sluggish economy.
   Analysts said the news was in line with market expectations and
gave a boost to bond prices, which in turn helped support the stock
market.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up more than $3 for
each $1,000 in face amount by late afternoon.
   The analysts predicted there would be caution in the market
later this week, especially with May employment figures due to be
released on Friday.

<HEAD>Chancellor Ponders Accepting Money From Felon Financier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chancellor of New York City's schools is
reconsidering the school system's acceptance of donations from
Michael Milken's foundation, following the disclosure that the
financier has visited a Harlem elementary school since pleading
guilty to felony charges.
   Milken, the junk bond billionaire, visited P.S. 92 on May 24 and
25 and on the second day gave a math lesson to about 30 elementary
students who were taken out of their regular classes to be with
him, according to a New York City newspaper.
   Milken faces up to 28 years in prison when he is sentenced in
October on his April 24 plea to violating federal securities and
tax laws.
   Milken's family foundation is a contributor to educational
causes, and Milken himself has visited classrooms around the
country. Money from the foundation, and from other foundations and
corporate contributors, has been needed and welcomed by the New
York school system, said James Vlasto, a spokesman for Schools
Chancellor Joseph Fernandez.
   ``But under the circumstances of Mr. Milken's current situation,
we are re-assessing the relationship between the Milken Foundation
and the New York City school system,'' Vlasto said Wednesday.
   According to the New York Post, Milken's foundation gave the
school a $50,000 grant last year for a computer center and flew the
school's principal, Steve Kaminsky, to Los Angeles for a computer
conference.
   In December the children received T-shirts and other Christmas
presents from the foundation, the Post said. At the time, Milken
was under a 98-count indictment and being threatened with added
charges.
   Kaminsky was quoted by the Post as saying, ``I'm not going to be
a hypocrite and say it's OK to take Mr. Milken's money and then not
allow the gentleman into the building.''
   Calls to the school seeking further comment from Kaminsky were
referred to the district superintendent, Bertrand Brown. Brown, who
the Post said approved Milken's visits to the school, did not
respond immediately to a call for comment.
   A spokesman for Milken, Ken Lerer, said Milken has donated money
to support education since the 1970s.

<HEAD>Walt Disney World To Help Orange County Borrow Money For Low-Cost
Mortgages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney World officials hope a plan to
help Orange County borrow about $80 million for low-cost housing
mortgages will foster some goodwill with its neighbors.
   Under the agreement, the company would back Orange County's
refinancing of a 1980 housing loan with New York bankers.
   Disney would benefit by ending a conflict that erupted after it
won a drawing that gave it the right to issue all the tax-exempt
bonds allocated for a six-county Central Florida area.
   ``We're interested partly because we've got a responsibility to
this community and a good image in this community that we want to
protect,'' Peter Rummell, president of Disney's development
company, said after the tentative agreement was reached Tuesday.
   Disney plans to spend $1.8 million to buy up the residual _ the
profit a bank stands to earn over the life of a bond issue _ from
the institution that holds the county's 1980 loan.
   A new loan for $80 million can then be negotiated.
   Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District, which functions as an
autonomous governmental unit, will use its tax-exempt bonding power
to build a sewage treatment plant on the attraction's 27,400-acre
property stradding Orange and Osceola counties.
   The bonds are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis by
the state Division of Bond Finance. The application from Orange
County, which originally had asked for $19 million, arrived Jan. 4,
two days after applications from Reedy Creek and Volusia and
Brevard counties.
   The three Jan. 2 applications were put into a box, and Reedy
Creek won the drawing.

   Crude oil and gasoline prices rose Wednesday as
traders tried to determine the extent of damage an early morning
earthquake caused to Romanian oil fields and refineries.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 10 cents to $18.08 per 42-gallon
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange following an 18-cent
increase Tuesday. Later contract months also showed small increases.
   The June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.08
cents to 66.87 cents a gallon, on top of Tuesday's 2.38 cent
increase. The July contract increased 0.30 cents to 63.26 cents a
gallon.
   The price of crude rose 20 cents to 30 cents a barrel early
Wednesday because of concerns that the earthquake, which struck at
6:40 a.m. Eastern time, had damaged oil installations in Romania
and along a fault line into Turkey and the Black Sea, said Peter
Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures
Inc.
   Severe damage would diminish the amount of gasoline on the world
market, driving up prices.
   But he said the price of crude, which reached a high of $18.45 a
barrel, declined and stabilized as traders received word that the
damage may not be as bad as originally thought. He said the extent
of damage was still unclear as traders conducted business during
the afternoon, but reports were more optimistic than when the
market opened.
   ``It appears there's less likelihood now that there would have
been a problem,'' he said.
   Beutel said Romania is major exporter of gasoline, with much of
its supply shipped to the West.
   Analysts said the energy futures prices also may have increased
in anticipation of new refinery capacity usage figures due for
release after the close of markets by the American Petroleum
Institute.
   ``They're just trying to book profits before the numbers come
out in case there's a surprise,'' said William Byers, director of
futures research at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
   Among other refined products traded on the Merc, the June
contract for home heating oil rose 0.91 cent a gallon to 51.15
cents, after rising 0.58 cent on Tuesday. Later months showed
smaller increases.
   Natural gas prices were mostly up. The July contract was
unchanged at $1.585 per 1,000 cubic feet, while future months
increased slightly.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains; Gold Lower</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against most major currencies
except the British pound Wednesday, benefiting from weakness in the
West German mark.
   Gold prices posted moderate losses in domestic and overseas
dealing.
   The dollar's advance did not reflect any fundamental improvement
in market sentiment toward the U.S. currency. Rather, the dollar
buying chiefly was a byproduct of mark selling.
   John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam
Bank in New York, said the West German currency has been under
pressure due to persistent concerns about possibly negative
consequences of German unification.
   The pound got a boost from expectations that Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major soon would indicate when Britain would enter
into the European Monetary System's exchange rate accord.
   The pound peaked in Europe at $1.7071 after comments by Major
from Paris where he was meeting with his French counterpart, Pierre
Beregovoy. But sterling pulled back from its highs when it became
clear that Major was not going to disclose anything significant for
the time being.
   The pound was quoted late in London at $1.6930 compared to
$1.6953 late Tuesday. In later New York trading, a pound fetched
$1.6950 compared to $1.6945 late Tuesday.
   Foreign exchange dealers expect the dollar to trade within a
narrow range as the market awaits the release of U.S. employment
data for May, due out Friday. The monthly jobs report frequently
moves financial markets.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising 0.05 yen to
a closing rate of 150.75 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at
151.30 yen. The dollar gained more ground in New York and was
quoted at 151.45 yen late in the day, up from 151.22 yen late
Tuesday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late quotes, included: 1.6825 West German marks, up from 1.6740
West German marks; 1.42265 Swiss francs, up from 1.4105; 5.6735
French francs, up from 5.6380; 1,237.75 Italian lire, up from
1,229.50; and 1.17675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17945.
   The Canadian dollar's strength against its U.S. counterpart was
attributed to technical trading factors, dealers said.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday's
levels were: 1.6810 West German marks, up from 1.6710; 1.4210 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4080; 5.6715 French francs, up from 5.6280;
1.8880 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8810; 1,237.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,228.25; and 1.1778 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1815.
   Precious metals prices moved lower.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
current delivery lost $3.30 to close at $364.10. Republic National
Bank quoted a late bid of $364.55 for a troy ounce of gold bullion,
$2.35 lower than Tuesday.
   Gold was quoted at a bid of $366.65 an ounce late in London,
down from $367.60 late Tuesday. In Zurich, the gold bid was
$366.25, down from $367.50 late Tuesday. Gold in Hong Kong fell
$2.01 to close at a bid of $367.47 an ounce.
   Silver for current delivery fell to $5.047 a troy ounce on New
York Comex from $5.138 on Tuesday. In London, silver was quoted at
a bid of $5.15 an ounce, down from Tuesday's $5.17.

   Prices moved moderately higher on Wall Street
Wednesday, nudging the Dow Jones industrial average to yet another
closing high and toward the 2,900 mark.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks picked up 8.07 to
finish at 2,878.56 and eclipse the previous high close of 2,870.49,
set only one day before. On Tuesday, the average soared nearly 50
points as technology issues led the market in a late buying surge.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
893 up, 693 down and 523 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a heavy 199.54
million shares, up from 137.41 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 248.22 million shares.
   The market's advance Wednesday came as little surprise to
analysts who expected the momentum from Tuesday's buying spree to
spill over into another session.
   But they also were not surprised by hesitation in the market.
Computer-generated sell orders eroded gains at several points
during Wednesday's session and took the Dow Jones average briefly
into minus territory.
   A.C. Moore, an analyst with Argus Research Corp., said prices
were able to withstand the dips partly because of strength in the
bond market. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up more
than $3 for each $1,000 in face amount by late afternoon.
   Including Wednesday's results, the Dow Jones industrials have
had eight new closing highs this month, but analysts shied away
from predicting the blue chip barometer will crash through 2,900.
   ``I don't sense that the tape has the type of momentum to make
an inexorable drive,'' said Moore, who noted that as prices rise
investors may begin to view stocks as overbought.
   Furthermore, analysts expected the market to become more
cautious prior to the government's release Friday of May employment
figures.
   The government reported Wednesday that its main economic
forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
slipped 0.2 percent in April, its second loss in four months and
another indication of the nation's sluggish economy. Analysts said
the news was in line with market expectations.
   The most active issue on the NYSE was Texas Utilities, which
rose &lsqb; to 36&rsqb;.
   Among blue chip issues, IBM was up 1&lsqb; to 120~, Philip Morris
fell 1&lsqb; to 42{, and General Electric was off &rsqb; at 69&rsqb;.
   Mobil rose 1 to 62~, Dow Chemicals slipped 1 to 63{, and
Woolworth rose 1&lsqb; to 66{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $3.189 billion, or 0.09
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.18 to 196.75.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.31 to 421.62, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.21 to 360.86.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.26 to 458.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 362.91, up 0.35.

<HEAD>Greyhound Will Remanufacture Old Buses Instead of Buying New</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc., searching for ways to save
money and entice new financing, said Wednesday it would rebuild its
fleet of 3,949 buses instead of buying new models.
   President Frank Schmieder estimated the strike-bound busline
would save $318.5 million over the cost of replacing the buses in
2{ years. Greyhound plans to rebuild 728 buses annually, finishing
the fleet in a little more than five years.
   Greyhound, which operates the only nationwide bus system, has
been experimenting with remanufacturing buses for more than a year,
and had begun streamlining its maintenance operation even before
bus drivers went on strike March 2.
   The company has operated a reduced schedule since the 6,300
drivers walked out, and lower revenue and resulting losses have
hurt the company's balance sheet.
   Greyhound will remanufacture its buses at an expanded garage in
Jackson, Miss., and at a second, yet-to-be-determined site.
   ``A new bus is a quality piece of heavy equipment made to last
25 years,'' Schmieder said in remarks prepared for delivery in
Jackson. ``It doesn't make sense to get rid of it just because its
engine, transmission and air conditioning systems have failed.
Those things can be replaced.''
   Schmieder said it costs Greyhound about $25,000 to remanufacture
a bus, compared to $200,000 for a new one.
   Engines and transmissions will be replaced, as will key
components such as brakes and shock absorbers. Other parts will be
replaced or repaired as needed then the bus will get new
upholstery, side panels, glass and paint.
   ``We're not doing this to scrimp,'' spokesman George Gravley
said. ``We expect the quality of our buses to be better,''
resulting in less downtime and ``a better product for the
customer.''
   Greyhound already has missed more than $14 million in lease and
interest payments, putting it in violation of agreements with its
creditors.
   The next deadline comes Friday, when the company owes a $2.5
million payment on a $40 million loan. Gravley said a decision on
making the payment had not been made. Greyhound also has a $2.8
million interest payment due in mid-July.
   In an effort to avoid bankruptcy, Greyhound has offered to
repurchase a majority of its $225 million in junk bonds for about
$90 million. Greyhound must borrow the money to buy back the bonds,
however, and analysts have questioned whether the company can find
the financing under current market conditions.
   Gravley said negotiations are continuing with possible lenders,
but no announcement is imminent. The repurchase offer is set to
expire June 18 but could be extended.
   Greyhound bought 476 new buses in 1987 and 1988, the first two
years after investors bought the company in a leveraged buyout. No
new buses were purchased last year, and Schmieder said the
remanufacturing program assumes the company will not buy any new
buses until at least 1993.

<HEAD>Ford Again Not Offering Year-End Dealer Credit; Using Incentives
Instead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. plans to offer customer incentives
instead of a discount to dealers this fall to help spur sales at
the end of the 1990 model year, a company spokesman said Wednesday.
   The minimum possible incentives, outlined in a letter to Ford
dealers, are lower than those in the automaker's current incentive
program but go higher if demanded by market conditions.
   The incentives would be in lieu of ``carryover'' credits _
effectively a discount to dealers _ that Ford used to offer to help
spur sales of prior-year vehicles when new model years began. It's
the second straight year that Ford has eliminated the 5 percent
carryover credit.
   The carryover allowance applied to cars on a dealer's lot when
the new model year began. Dealers used the allowances for customer
incentives, to pay for salesperson contests, to buy advertising or
simply pad their own profits.
   Ford spokesman Bill Carroll said Wednesday that the letter to
dealrs outlined some year-end plans, including the list of minimum
possible incentives on 1990 cars and trucks and a plea for more car
and truck orders.
   Ford's current incentive program is due to expire July 9. The
year-end incentives will be offered between Sept. 28 and the end of
the calendar year. Automotive model years typically begin Oct. 1.
   ``In our letter to dealers, we're mainly pointing out that we've
eliminated, for the second straight year, the 5 percent
carryover,'' Carroll said. ``We feel that it's better to eliminate
that and let it go by what the market is and what the incentive
programs are rather than the carryover program.''
   Ford's move did not sit well with the National Automobile
Dealers Association, which represents about 20,000 U.S. car and
truck retailers.
   ``It's still our longstanding belief that we are better local
marketers than the manufacturers,'' NADA spokesman Jake Kelderman
said Wednesday.
   ``From the dealers' perspective, when it comes to year-end
marketing, they would like to have more control than under a
program such as this,'' he said. ``We just have a general problem
with all this stuff of going over our heads with our consumers.
   ``It creates a lot of confusion in the marketplace.''
   Automakers are offering a wide array of incentives directly to
customers, including cash rebates ranging from $200 to $5,000 or
financing with interest rates as low as 2.9 percent.
   The companies also offer some other incentives to dealers, keyed
to car sales. Those incentives are used for advertising, contests
or are passed along to car buyers.
   General Motors Corp. will give dealers 5 percent of the sticker
price of 1990 model cars they sell after the start of the 1991
model year in October, until Dec. 31.
   Chrysler Corp. spokesman Tom Jakobowski declined to say what
kind of deal, if any, his company would offer dealers at the end of
the model year.
   Ford also used its letter to seek more orders for 1990 model
cars.
   ``We reminded them (dealers) that, `You could be in short supply
of certain cars and you should figure out what you need and put
orders in during this build-out period,'' Carroll said.
   A build-out period is the time when factory production is
indexed heavily to dealer orders, while manufacturers try to limit
production to expected demand. Recently, Ford temporarily shut down
its Chicago and Atlanta factories, which make the company's popular
Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans. Ford said each closing was
prompted by a shortage of dealer orders.

   Big Macs wowed Moscow, so perhaps it
should come as no surprise. But the Walt Disney Co. says Muscovites
gobbled up all 200,000 Russian-language Mickey Mouse comics
magazines the first day of release.
   The 32-page magazine, designed as the first in a quarterly
series, was released May 16 and sold for 1.5 rubles a copy _ $2.40
or so. It contains five comics of various lengths already published
in other countries, with dialogue in the ``word balloons''
translated into Russian.
   Disney's familiar menagerie is on display: Goofy and Mickey fly
a kite from an airplane on the front cover; Goofy and some little
green men sail past planets in a bubble-top spaceship on the back.
How universal can entertainment get?
   In fact, Disney is part of a number of Western comics publishers
whose sales have risen in Western Europe in recent years and now
are eyeing untapped markets in a part of the world where officials
once looked askance at capitalists like Scrooge McDuck.
   Disney, for example, has sold Mickey Mouse comics in Hungary for
about 2{ years, with recent sales reaching 125,000 a month. Eastern
Europe is still a tiny fragment of Disney's annual $1.5 billion in
consumer product sales, but the idea is to get the franchise in
early as the trade doors open wider.
   The Moscow comic sales numbers reported by Disney are strong,
other publishers said.
   ``Two hundred thousand copies in a day? I'm impressed!'' said
James E. Galton, the president of New York's Marvel Comics, home to
Spider-Man, X-Men, Fantastic Four, Captain America and The
Incredible Hulk.
   Marvel, the largest U.S. comics producer, publishes in 15
languages and 25 countries. Their Conan the Barbarian has invaded
Hungary and they publish four titles in Yugoslavia, Galton said.
   ``Right now, I've got a guy in Moscow checking out the
possibilities of publishing there,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``We also have German publishers shipping copies from
West Germany to East Germany _ that's been going on since they
knocked down the Berlin Wall.''
   The Disney publication is a joint venture between the
Disney-licensed Danish publisher Gutenberghus and Soviet publisher
Fizkultura I Sport. The partnership was managed by Disney's
consumer products subsidiary in West Germany.
   The comic book was distributed at hundreds of Moscow magazine
kiosks, and the publishers reported the single-day sellout,
according to Disney's senior vice president in Europe, Dennis
Hightower.
   In a telephone interview from Milan, Italy, Hightower said the
publishers estimated that Soviet demand was strong enough to have
sold 1.5 million copies nationwide. ``The major criticism we've
gotten is why weren't there more copies, and that's unfortunately a
problem with the paper allocation.''
   To put the numbers in perspective, Marvel expects to set a
single-issue record with a new, soon-to-be released Spiderman
comic. About 2 million copies have been presold in the United
States and Canada, and total sales should be 2.3 million or more,
said Marvel spokeswoman Pamela Rutt.
   Issue No. 2 of the Russian Mickey Mouse comic book series is
scheduled for July. It is expected the press run again will be
limited to 200,000 copies, reflecting the amount of printing paper
allocated to the magazine.
   In most countries of the world, U.S. comics are produced by
licensed publishers. In Spain, for example, Disney produces comics
in a joint venture with Brazilian publisher Abril. All of Marvel's
overseas deals are licensed except in England, where Marvel has a
subsidiary.
   However, Disney itself recently began publishing Topolino
(Mickey Mouse) comics in Italy, selling as many as 700,000 copies
each week.
   Disney also began publishing its own series of eight monthly
comics in the United States in April.
   It's not just big publishers who are moving into Europe. For
example, Eclipse Comics of Forestville, Calif., had revenue of
about $3.5 million last year, with 5 percent of that from European
publishing _ up from 2 percent three years ago, publisher Dean
Mullaney said.
   ``Comics are a luxury,'' he said. ``But what seems to be
happening is that they really want our entertainment, because they
haven't had access to it for so long.''

<HEAD>Boesky Trader Alleges Securities Trading Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivan Boesky's chief trader testified Wednesday
that John Mulheren Jr. temporarily held large blocks of securities
for Boesky in 1985 in an alleged scheme to help his former friend
avoid taxes and securities rules.
   Michael Davidoff, testifying at Mulheren's trial in U.S.
District Court, offered a trade-by-trade breakdown of an alleged
pact with Boesky's Seemala Corp. that forms the heart of
government's case against Mulheren.
   The government has said Mulheren entered into the trades with
Boesky in exchange for information about pending corporate
takeovers. Mulheren, 40, of Rumson, N.J., is charged with 41 counts
of conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, and record-keeping
violations.
   Davidoff has pleaded guilty to one felony charge and agreed to
cooperate with the government. Boesky testified for three days last
week in his first appearance as a witness since he pleaded guilty
in Wall Street's insider trading scandal in 1986.
   During daylong testimony Wednesday, Davidoff said Boesky turned
to Mulheren in mid-1985 to buy large blocks of securities and sell
them back after 31 days in a ``parking'' arrangement to create
phony trading losses for tax purposes.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Alfred Pavlis presented more than a
dozen trading records indicating that Boesky sold Mulheren the
securities one date and in most cases bought them back shortly
thereafter.
   The evidence and testimony marked the first substantive accounts
backing the government's allegations. In illegal stock ``parking,''
ownership of securities is concealed to avoid disclosure or other
federal guidelines.
   Under the deal, Mulheren bought 330,000 shares or $10 million
worth of Unical Corp. stock from Boesky through a third party
broker in July 1985. A month later, Davidoff told Mulheren that
Boesky didn't want to buy back the stock and Mulheren agreed to
keep the shares.
   Davidoff also cited alleged parking arrangements involving
securities known as options in Boise Cascade Corp., Warner
Communications Inc., American Hospital Supply Inc., Storer
Communications Inc. and R.H. Macy &amp; Co.
   Davidoff did not directly say that Mulheren knew the purchases
and sales were designed to break the law. He did say he drew up an
agreement that Seemala would be responsible for all profits and
losses in the transactions.
   By the end of 1985, Jamie Securities, Mulheren's now-defunct
trading firm, owed Boesky close to $2 million from trading profits,
Davidoff said.
   He testified that Mulheren suggested Jamie Securities inflate
brokerage fee bills and pay off the money gradually. The government
has alleged the money was paid back in 1986.
   Davidoff said Leonard DeStefano, a trading assistant at Jamie
Securities and Mulheren's co-defendant, was designated as his
contact during monthly payment of the alleged brokerage bills.
DeStefano, 34, is charged with two counts of conspiracy and fraud
in the case.
   Boesky's three-year prison sentence ended last month. He had
pleaded guilty to one felony count, paid $100 million in penalties
and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
   Once one of Wall Street's most successful stock traders, Boesky
provided the government information used against several prominent
figures, including Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its former junk
bond executive, Michael Milken.
   Mulheren is the only one of those directly named by Boesky to go
to trial. Others, including Boesky and Milken, have pleaded guilty
to violating securities laws and other crimes.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Tumble on Bearish Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices fell Wednesday for the second straight day
on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange in reaction to a
report of increased sugar production and a supply surplus.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans futures were mostly lower,
energy futures gained, precious metals fell, and livestock and pork
futures retreated.
   On Tuesday, the West German statistics firm F.O. Licht reversed
its world sugar deficit estimate of 57,000 metic tons to a surplus
of 694,000 metric tons.
   Licht also revised production and consumption figures, placing
production in the season ending Aug. 30, 1990, at 108.55 million
metric tons from 107.91 million. Consumption was revised down to
107.86 million metric tons from 108.07 million.
   Analysts said sugar futures contracts for coming months continue
to trade at a premium compared to later months despite the report,
an indication that a surplus does not exist.
   Sugar settled .27 cent to .38 cent lower with the contract for
delivery in October at 13.70 cents a pound. On Tuesday, sugar
prices fell by even larger amounts.
   Judith Ganes, a commodity analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in
New York, said Licht issued a statement Wednesday indicating
Tuesday's sell-off was overdone. But she said the sell-off should
help stimulate demand for sugar.
   ``If you don't see major users come in at this level, prices
will continue to slide,'' she said.
   Grain futures prices closed lower and soybeans were mixed on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The expectation of drier conditions sent
corn futures lower. The weather will allow many farmers to finish
remaining corn planting.
   Soybeans prices were marginally lower as traders consolidated
positions after a sell-off Tuesday. Reports of possible offers from
Asia for U.S. soybeans gave some support to soybean prices.
   Wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with July at $3.32\ a bushel;
corn was 3 cents to 4} cents lower with July at $2.79{ a bushel;
oats were 3\ cents to 3} cents lower with July at $1.42{ a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents lower to 3 cents higher with July at $6.05\
a bushel.
   Energy futures were higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
but prices settled down from the day's highs as traders became
cautious in anticipation of oil inventory figures.
   Analysts said they expected American Petroleum Institute stocks
figures to show a rise in crude inventories.
   After the close of trading, the API reported gasoline stocks up
1.055 million barrels in the latest week; it reported crude oil
stocks up 2.109 million barrels and U.S. distillate stocks up
737,000 barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 10 cents higher
with July at $18.08 a barrel; heating oil was .39 cent to .91 cent
higher with June at 51.15 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10
cent lower to 1.08 cents higher with June at 66.87 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Selling to take profits and forecasts for more rain in the
Midwest this week send live hog futures down. Analysts said rain
could prompt farmers to bring hogs to market. Hog futures selling
pushed down frozen pork belly prices.
   Cattle futures were lower, pressured by commercial selling and
spillover from the selloff in pork.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .33 cent lower with June at 73.97
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .35 cent lower with
August at 83.57 cents a pound; hogs were .22 cent to 1.30 cents
lower with June at 66.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.20 cent to 1.80 cent lower with July at 66.05 cents a pound.
   Precious metals futures were lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the U.S. dollar showed renewed strength against major
foreign currencies.
   Gold was $3 to $3.30 lower with June at $364.10 a troy ounce;
silver was 9.1 cents to 10.3 cents lower with June at $5.047 a troy
ounce.

   For almost two years, Ron Dinsmore
has scoured want ads, sifted resumes and combed a nationwide job
bank to find work for some of the 2,500 people laid off when
Volkswagen closed its U.S. assembly plant.
   The state employment counselor thought salvation may have come
when Sony Corp., another foreign industrial giant, announced in
April that it would convert the sprawling facility near this rural
western Pennsylvania town into a high-tech television tube factory.
   ``Everybody wants to know how to apply,'' said Dinsmore, 43, who
once was a full-time union representative at the VW plant and will
be seeking work himself in a few months when grant funding expires
for his own position.
   The Japanese electronics maker undoubtedly will give the area a
needed economic boost. But it remains unclear whether local VW
veterans, who once learned from scratch how to assemble cars, will
be rehired to build a product far more complex. Some experts doubt
it.
   ``I really think that Sony will recruit a new work force,'' said
Richard Florida, a management professor at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, who has studied Japanese industries
transplanted to the United States. ``Most of the jobs in that Sony
plant are going to be higher-skilled than auto work.''
   Sony said one reason it chose this area was the relatively high
level of education among students. For example, it looked at such
measures of student achivement as Scholastic Aptitute Test scores
to determine the quality of area schools in educating future
employees.
   But Kunitake Ando, president of Sony Engineering and
Manufacturing of America, hinted the company may not hire many
former VW workers.
   ``We are heavily recruiting engineering types, rather than
simple assembly-line workers,'' he said when the announcement was
made.
   The plant that Sony will occupy, built in a former cornfield,
stands like a monument to the frustration stories of the two other
manufacturers responsible for creating it.
   Chrysler Corp. began building it as an auto factory in 1968 but
never finished. Volkswagen of America took over and opened the
factory a decade later. Employment peaked at 5,700 in 1980, and
more than 1 million vehicles were built by the time VW closed shop
in 1988 because of declining demand.
   Pennsylvania is forgiving $40 million of the $70 million it
loaned Volkswagen to start operations. Sony will lease the plant
from the state.
   Although more than half of those laid off two years ago have
found work, Dinsmore said he counsels about 150 unemployed or
underemployed ex-VW workers weekly from his desk in a corner
cubicle at a state-funded employment training center in the county
seat of Greensburg.
   Dinsmore said he's had little information to share about Sony's
hiring plans, except that it expects to recruit about 1,000 people
in the next three years. He said he's still trying to find out what
type of workers Sony needs.
   ``I've read all different things in the paper. They want people
with dexterity skills, they want people with math skills, they want
people with electronic skills,'' he said. ``Everyone's waiting to
see what they need.''
   Among those waiting is Calvin Tomanda, 43, who had worked in
VW's supply store for more than 10 years. Tomanda issued equipment
throughout the 2.2 million square-foot factory, built along a
winding stretch of two-lane highway.
   Since his layoff, full-time work has eluded him. He entered an
18-month physical therapy training program, but that closed when he
was half-finished.
   Tomanda now works part-time as a nurse's aide and is looking for
a job in a warehouse.
   ``Like everyone else, we all hoped that Sony would take the
facility,'' he said. ``Whether former VW workers will be able to be
in there in sufficient numbers remains to be seen.''
   Phil Davis, 50, who worked 10{ years as general supervisor of
material and production control, is unemployed and studying
business management. He said Sony's announcement interested him,
but only in a passing way.
   ``It's good for the area,'' he said. ``I don't know if it'll
have a direct impact on me.''
   Davis said he'd like to find a job before Sony begins production
in about 18 months.
   ``I'm not banking on this for salvation for my employment,'' he
said.
   Even if Sony is not the answer to the problems of unemployed
autoworkers, the reopened plant will strengthen the economic base
of Westmoreland County and local municipalities, where the primary
source of income is farming.
   ``That plant sitting idly as a dinosaur _ what was once a very
fast-paced, very fast-moving production facility _ was doing nobody
any good,'' said Terry Marolt, chairman of the county board of
commissioners.
   ``It's obvious that there's the big clout benefit immediately of
a plant the size of Sony coming in,'' he said. ``In addition to
that, there's a rippling effect that flows throughout the business
world in the area.''
   Although a tax package has not been worked out, Sony has agreed
to at least match the $75,000 in property taxes paid by Volkswagen,
said Howard J. Keefer, an East Huntingdon Township supervisor.
Keefer said he's eager to use the money to provide some long-needed
repairs to roads, bridges, water lines and sewers.
   Local merchants also are optimistic about the arrival of a
sizable, regular payroll.
   ``When Volkswagen first came in, it definitely had an impact,''
said Basil Hawanchak, controller of Levin Furniture Co. in Mount
Pleasant. ``We're expecting the same type of impact from Sony.''
   Sony has said it hopes to build complete televisions at the
plant and has an option to purchase additional acreage for
businesses such as glass and cabinet makers.
   Former VW workers won't be written off completely as potential
Sony employees, said Florida. They might be hired for appearances
and taught the necessary skills, he said.
   ``I think the Japanese can train anyone to do anything,'' he
said.
   Dinsmore said the former autoworkers are not deterred by the
prospect of learning how to do high-tech work.
   ``Let me say this, in 1977 there wasn't a person in Westmoreland
County that built cars. In 1985 we won car of the year,'' he said.
   Motor Trend magazine gave the award to VW's GTI model,
manufactured at the plant along with the Rabbit, Golf and Jetta.
   ``No one knew how to build a car _ never built one in this
county before, or in the state,'' he said. ``They trained them,
they sent people to Germany, they sent a bunch of Germans in here
and did some training.
   ``So, you know, we can build televisions. We can build anything
if we get the proper training.''

   A federal judge Wednesday allowed Ames
Department Stores Inc. to pay $1.2 million to 6,500 employees who
left the discount retailer before it filed for bankruptcy
protection in April.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard Buschman III in New York approved a
request by Ames to pay up to $2,000 in severance and vacation pay
to employees who were not paid before the company filed for Chapter
11 protection.
   In the order, the judge indicated that payments should be mailed
to about 6,500 former employees on June 7. Bankruptcy court
approval is required for such expenditures.
   Ames, which operates 680 discount retail stores in 20 states,
filed for protection April 25 after suppliers stopped shipments in
the midst of mounting financial problems for the company, based in
Rocky Hill.
   Earlier this month, the court approved a $250 million financing
plan to allow the company to continue paying suppliers as it
reorganizes its business and finances.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. President Paul E.
Lego on Wednesday was named chairman and chief executive, following
a course started three years ago.
   Lego, who also holds the title of chief operating officer, will
succeed John C. Marous. Marous, 65, and Lego, 60, were promoted
three years ago when Douglas Danforth stepped down, leaving all
four titles open.
   Westinghouse did not name a new president or chief operating
officer.
   Analysts said Wednesday's move, effective July 1, is part of a
transition the company's board designed in 1987.
   ``Lego has been involved with Marous in the decision-making
process all along,'' said Ross Leavitt of Salomon Inc. ``There may
be some modest policy shifts.''
   Robert McCoy Jr. of UBS Securities said Lego's answers to
questions at a meeting of New York financial analysts earlier this
month lacked detail, and the appearance was blamed for a sudden
drop in Westinghouse's stock price.
   Westinghouse's stock closed Wednesday down 62{ cents at $35 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Westinghouse, a diversified company with interests in nuclear
energy, manufacturing, broadcasting and commercial finance, last
year posted earnings of $922 million, or $6.30 per share, on sales
of $12.8 billion.
   The 104-year-old company employs 115,000. Lego, who joined the
company in 1956 as an engineer, will be its 13th chairman.
   Marous earned $3.1 million in salary, benefits and stock
earnings in 1989. As president, Lego earned $2.5 million, according
to the company's financial disclosures.

   Continental Airlines said Wednesday it sold $200
million in bonds to finance a new terminal at New York City's La
Guardia Airport.
   Houston-based Continental said the bond issue was oversubscribed
on Wednesday, the same day it was issued. The offering represents
the largest facility bond issue in the carrier's history, officials
said.
   The new terminal is scheduled to be completed in early 1992.
   Continental, a subsidiary of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., will
be the terminal's primary tenant. The terminal will have 10
aircraft gates, eight for wide-body aircraft.
   The underwriting group was led by Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.
   ``Continental is pleased that the financial community recognizes
and is willing to participate in our future,'' said Continental
President Mickey Foret. ``We are particularly gratified that
investors signaled their confidence in Continental by
oversubscribing in an issue of this size.''

<HEAD>Jury Rules Against Ashland Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ashland Oil Inc. was ordered Wednesday
to pay $10.3 million to four neighbors of its Catlettsburg, Ky.,
refinery who said emissions from the plant hurt their health and
damaged their property.
   Residents of Ceredo and Kenova, W.Va. and Catlettsburg, Ky.,
brought suit against Ashland in Kanawha County Circuit Court after
they found a white substance on their cars and homes. The substance
was not easily removed and damaged their property, they alleged.
   ``The verdict recognizes the magnitude of the problem that
people have been living with for a number of years,'' said D.L.
Hamilton, an attorney for the residents. ``I hope Ashland Oil got
the message.''
   Hundreds of other Kenova-area residents have brought similar
suits against Ashland.
   Dan Lacy, vice president of corporate communications for
Ashland, said the company would appeal.
   The company's appeal to the state Supreme Court will be based on
Kanawha Circuit Judge Tod Kaufman's decision to block testimony and
evidence Ashland attorneys believed vital to their case, Lacy said.
   The court blocked testimony from a former Environmental
Protection Agency official who would have testified about air
quality standards, Lacy said. It also prevented jurors from hearing
about evidence collected by the company's air quality monitoring
units in the Kenova area.
   ``Had we been able to bring that information to the jury we
honestly believe the jury's verdict would be different,'' Lacy said.
   Ashland attorneys did argue that neighbors of the refinery
feared it because they didn't understand it. They also said the
residents lacked concrete evidence of illness or property damage,
such as medical or repair bills.
   Wednesday's verdict was the first part of the trial. In the
second part, the court will determine whether Ashland must pay the
tab for periodic health tests of the residents.
