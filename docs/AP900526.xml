<HEAD>Station Airs Half-Hour of Silence to Promote Reading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television station broadcast a half-hour of
silence to encourage families to read.
   Viewers who tuned to WLWT at 7 p.m. Friday for the syndicated
program ``Inside Edition'' instead saw the message, ``Please take
this time to read.'' There was no sound.
   The program was called ``Read Every Day System,'' or REDS, and
preceded the telecast of a baseball game between the Cincinnati
Reds and the Montreal Expos.
   It was part of an educational project by the station that has
included half-hour prime-time specials and public service
announcements on education, station manager Cliff Abromatz said. He
said the station plans similar telecasts in the future.
   ``They probably won't be half-hours, but they will be projects
designed to get children to read,'' Abromatz said.
   He declined to say how much the station lost by not selling
advertising during the half-hour, which is one of its most
profitable time periods.

<HEAD>Harvard Honors Colombian Journalists for Coverage of Drug Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombian journalists who have risked
their lives to cover the drug trade are being honored by Harvard
University's Nieman Foundation.
   The 1990 Louis M. Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in
Journalism has been awarded to Colombian reporters, both living and
dead, who have covered the drug industry and its effect on that
country, the foundation announced Friday.
   Luis Gabriel Cano, 67, president of El Espectador, a Bogota
newspaper, will accept the award this fall. El Espectador has lost
many of its staff to death or exile and had its newsroom bombed by
narco-terrorists last September.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based human
rights group, has documented the killing of 20 reporters and
editors in Colombia by agents of drug lords in the last five years.
However, Cano and other Colombian journalists estimate that 50 news
organization employees, including business employees, have been
killed, the foundation said.
   Among those murdered was Cano's brother, Guillermo Cano, El
Espectador editor-in-chief and a columnist.
   ``Mr. Cano has lost his brother and several of his associates to
the narco-mafia assassins, and recently suffered a major bombing to
the paper's installations which caused $2.5 million in damages,
seriously jeopardizing the paper,'' T. Roberto Eisenmann Jr.,
editor of La Prensa in Panama and a former Nieman fellow, wrote in
nominating Cano for the award.
   ``Yet Cano struggled on, realizing that if his newspaper fails
in its efforts, his country's institutions might crumble, giving
way to narco-mafia dominance. His courage is especially inspiring
for our profession.''
   A committee of the 21 members of the Nieman Fellow Class of 1990
chose the Colombians for the award, which is named in honor of
former Nieman curator Louis M. Lyons.
   The award carried an honorarium of $1,000. Cano will travel to
Cambridge to accept the award on behalf of his Colombian colleagues.

   U.S. members of the Mount Everest International
Peace Climb returned home Friday after placing 20 climbers on the
summit of the world's highest peak.
   Expedition leader Jim Whittaker said placing American, Soviet
and Chinese mountaineers side by side on the summit was a model for
the superpowers to emulate.
   ``We have a bond that will never stop,'' said Whittaker, who in
1963 became the first American to reach the top of Everest.
   ``My proudest moment was when we put the first group on the
summit. To have that vision become a reality was a wonderful
moment.''
   The first of the 20 climbers reached the 29,028-foot summit on
May 7, and were followed by the others over the next few days.
Tibetans who assisted in the climb also reached the summit.
   Previously, the record number of climbers to reach the top of
Everest with a single expedition was 17.
   The climbers said they collected about two tons of garbage while
on the mountain from previous expeditions as well as their own.
Some was buried, some was burned and some was carried off the
mountain to be recycled in China, said Dan Branley, a spokesman for
the climb.
   The expedition, which began in February, cost more than $1
million. It was being paid for by U.S. corporate sponsors,
including the L.L. Bean camping gear company of Freeport, Maine.

   Two activists for a radical environmental
group were arrested Friday in connection with a bomb blast that
ripped their car apart, but the duo and their supporters painted
them as victims, not criminals.
   ``The evidence is strong they were transporting this device and
that's why they were arrested,'' said Oakland Police Lt. Mike Sims
at a Friday news conference.
   ``Based on our determination of the placement of the device in
the car, we believe they should have known it was there. We believe
it went off accidently.''
   But in an interview from his jail cell, Darryl Cherney, who was
arrested along with Judi Bari, hotly denied carrying any explosive
devices and insisted that police investigate who was trying to kill
the pair.
   `` ... We are demanding ... that the Oakland Police Department
and the FBI seek out this assassin and bring whoever it is to
justice immediately,'' said Cherney, 33, describing himself and
Bari as victims.
   Bari's attorney, Susan Jordan, said her client also denied any
involvement with explosives during a meeting at Bari's hospital
bedsise.
   Bari, 40, required surgery at Highland Hospital for a fractured
pelvis and suffered other injuries, and was in listed stable
condition Friday. Cherney, who suffered minor injuries including a
head cut, was treated and released Thursday night.
   The two Earth First! supporters were being held for
investigation of possession and transportation of explosives.
Cherney was booked into city jail, and Bari was under guard at the
hospital.
   Jordan said that it's ``inconceiveable that they would destroy
their movement by doing that. It's always easy to charge somebody
who's unpopular.''
   Jordan added: ``If you had a bomb, wouldn't you be careful
enough not to place it where it could injure you?''
   The bomb exploded on an Oakland street just before noon Thursday
as Bari and Cherney were driving to a rally at the University of
California-Santa Cruz.
   The blast blew out the windows and the rear driver's side door
of Bari's station wagon. Other doors were blown open and the roof
was bowed upward.
   ``I don't believe it,'' said Mark Huntington, a friend of the
pair and an Earth First! supporter. ``If the police produced
evidence and put it on TV, I still wouldn't believe it. I think
they planted it. ... The FBI has a lot of reasons to get rid of
Darryl and Judi.''
   About 30 supporters of Earth First! on Friday maintained a vigil
outside Police Department headquarters in downtown Oakland, vowing
not to leave until Cherney and Bari were freed.
   Some in the crowd played guitars and held signs reading ``Stop
Blaming the Victim,'' ``Trees Not Bombs'' and ``The FBI Did It''.
   As many as 200 supporters gathered outside the police station
Friday night, wearing Earth First! t-shirts and singing folk songs.
   Sims said authorities served three search warrants and found
evidence in several places that led to the arrests. Thursday night,
police searched Cherney's van and a Berkeley house occupied by
several members of another environmentalist group, Seeds of Peace.
   Bari and Cherney had visited the house Wednesday night, and
Cherney's van was parked outside.
   The pair, described by friends as dedicated pacifists, were key
figures in planning ``Mississippi Summer in the California
Redwoods,'' an environmentalist effort to halt what they describe
as excessive logging of old-growth timber in northern California.
   Both were in the San Francisco Bay area to drum up support for
the summerlong campaign.
   The effort, patterned after the ``Mississippi Summer'' civil
rights protests that drew thousands of college students to the
South in 1964, has heightened tensions along the northern
California coast, where environmentalists and the logging industry
have long been at odds.
   Although Bari and Cherney's supporters said the two activists
are committed to non-violent change, Earth First! has become known
for tactics that include sabotage and vandalism, including ``tree
spiking'' _ driving spikes into soon-to-be-harvested trees to
damage logging equipment.
   Daniel Barron, an Earth First! organizer from San Francisco,
said about a dozen people have received anonymous death threats
such as one that was signed ``Committee for the Death of Earth
First!''
   One threat included a picture of Bari with the cross hairs of a
rifle sight drawn across her face, said Betty Ball of the Mendocino
Environmental Center.
   But environmentalists have not been the only targets. At
Louisiana-Pacific Lumber Co., spokesman Shepard Tucker said a pipe
bomb exploded two weeks ago at a mill in Cloverdale. An
investigation into that incident is continuing, said the Sonoma
County sheriff's department.

<HEAD>US May Deny Romania Trade Benefits Because of Election Abuses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is raising the
possibility that Romania may be denied U.S. trade benefits because
of electoral irregularities both during the campaign and on
election day.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the issue of
granting Romania most favored nation trade status is under review
as a result of the alleged abuses.
   That status would entitle Romania to have the lowest possible
tariff rates for its U.S. exports. The late President Nicolae
Ceausescu renounced the trade benefits two years ago because of
insistent U.S. demands for the protection of human rights as the
price for continuation of these privileges.
   According to some estimates, Ceausescu's action cost Romania
$250 million yearly in U.S. exports.
   Romania receives no U.S. economic assistance, but an $80 million
food aid program was began earlier this year.
   Official returns from last Sunday's election showed that acting
President Ion Iliescu won 85 percent of the vote and that
candidates from his National Salvation Front won almost 68 percent
in the balloting for the bicameral legislature.
   The Front has been in charge of Romania since the communist
regime was ousted last December. Its candidates consist mostly of
former communists who had a falling out with Ceausescu.
   Ms. Tutwiler said ``serious distortions'' during the campaign
included ``organized acts of intimidation and violence directed
primarily against the opposition candidates and their
sympathizers.''
   In addition, she said, the Front had virtually unrestricted use
of government resources for campaign purposes. Opposition parties,
meanwhile, did not have equitable access to public television and
were prevented from having reliable delivery of their campaign
literature.
   As for election day irregularities, Ms. Tutwiler said there were
instances of ``inadequate physical control over ballot boxes,
inappropriate `assistance' to some voters inside the voting booth,
and questions over the status of certain printed ballots and voter
identity cards.''
   She accused the Romanian government of failing to take
``sufficiently vigorous steps'' to remedy the distortions or to
discourage acts of intimidation and violence.
   On the other hand, she said that the overwhelming number of
Romanians were able to cast their ballots without visible coercion.
   ``We lack substantiating evidence that these voting day
irregularities were of sufficient weight to have altered the
outcome of the elections,'' she said.

<HEAD>New Group To Oppose Spread Of Bigger Trucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Huge trucks, with double or triple trailers,
could make driving more dangerous if allowed to spread to more of
America's highways, a new private group says.
   ``We have good cause to be afraid of these rigs,'' Gerald
Donaldson, a board member of Citizens for Reliable and Safe
Highways, said Friday. ``What the trucking industry wants is
ever-increasing size of trucks and ever-increasing weight of
trucks.''
   Leaders of the group, abbreviated as CRASH, announced its
founding at an outdoor news conference, with a 100-foot
triple-trailer truck placed in front of the Capitol dome as a
backdrop.
   The American Trucking Association, in a statement, said it is
not now seeking federal legislation to allow more widespread use of
very long trucks, with triple trailers or two 48-foot trailers.
They currently are restricted to certain highways in 13 Western
states.
   The association said CRASH was making ``an attempt to cloak the
rational discussion of trucking productivity in manufactured safety
hysteria.''
   It said CRASH was ``inspired and funded, at least indirectly''
by the railroads, which it said were trying ``to prevent increases
in trucking productivity and to enact unfair, burdensome truck
taxes.''
   Paul Loveday, vice president of Itel Corp., which owns and
leases railroad boxcars, told the CRASH news conference that his
company gave $150,000 to get the organization started.
   Other directors include former California Gov. Edmund G. ``Pat''
Brown, former Transportation Secretary John Volpe and Joan
Claybrook, former administrator of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration.
   ``If you look down the list of our board of directors, I don't
think you'll see anyone on that list who's a tool of industry,''
Loveday said.
   A statement distributed by CRASH said studies found double- and
triple-trailer trucks were more likely to be involved in crashes.
The trucking association said Transportation Department statistics
found bigger trucks to be as safe or safer than normal trucks.
   Claybrook said the group would try to influence the highway bill
Congress is expected to draft next year.
   She said CRASH also would push for stricter controls on drivers
who use drugs or alcohol, laws requiring devices on trucks to
record their speed and hours of operation automatically, and rules
to get poorly maintained trucks off the road.

<HEAD>Bush Plans To Plead Case For Keeping United Germany In NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he will use next
week's summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to make the
case for keeping Germany in NATO.
   The president, vacationing at his family compound at this
oceanfront resort, late Friday night signed a $4 billion spending
package that includes $720 million in emergency aid for Panama and
Nicaragua.
   The measure finally passed Congress in the wee hours Friday
morning. Bush signed it at 10:19 p.m. after an Air Force jet rushed
it to Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire and it was driven to
his home here.
   The president did so despite misgivings about what the White
House regards as pork-barrel add-ons by Congress and concerns about
restrictions on his ability to enter into international agreements
affecting NATO.
   In a statement, Bush said the $720 million will help ``restore
peace and ... support the emerging democracies in Panama and
Nicaragua.'' But he expressed ``regret that the Congress has used
this important legislation to enact many special interest
provisions that are not in response to dire emergencies.''
   He also criticized Congress for cutting $2 billion from defense
programs to offset about half of the $4 billion-plus cost of the
spending bill.
   In a pre-summit interview with French television, Bush said it
is not his problem whether Gorbachev is being hemmed in on arms
control and troop cutbacks by the Soviet high command.
   ``I gather he's in pretty strong control now, but facing
enormous problems,'' Bush said in the interview Thursday. The White
House released a transcript Friday.
   ``But it's not my role to figure out whether Gorbachev is having
a problem with his right or his left. It's mine to deal with what's
on the table. And what's on the table is a strong Soviet leader,
clearly in charge, with whom we have a lot of business items,'' he
said.
   ``I will approach him and make my case for a (united) Germany in
NATO,'' he said.
   In Moscow on Friday, Gorbachev said after meeting with French
President Francois Mitterrand that if the West insists on making
Germany a member of the Western military alliance, he would be
forced to take ``a fresh look'' at its polities on arms control and
European security.
   The White House declined comment on Gorbachev's warning,
spokesman Doug Davidson said.
   Bush hit the golf links with weekend guest Transportation
Secretary Sam Skinner shortly after arriving Friday. He was
expected to spend today jogging, playing tennis, boating and
getting in another 18 holes.
   Bush had called the presidents of Panama and Nicaragua before
leaving Washington on Friday to assure them help soon would be on
its way.
   The measure he signed provides $420 million for Panama,
rebuilding after U.S. economic sanctions and an invasion of
American forces last December to topple Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Nicaragua's new government, led by U.S.-backed President Violeta
Chamorro, will receive $300 million.
   The spending bill includes $1.2 billion needed to make up a
shortfall in food stamp funds for the current fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30; $545 million for veterans benefits; $166 million for
Head Start; $432 million for fighting forest fires; $110 million
for the Census; and $33 million for NASA.
   It also includes $75 million to meet refugee needs around the
world, $45 million in anti-narcotics aid to Bolivia and Peru, $30
million for aid to Caribbean countries and $30 million for Africa.
The final version dropped $10 million that the Senate wanted to
spend to build a new U.S. embassy in Lithuania.
   Bush complained the legislation would ``infringe upon my
constitutional authority over the conduct of diplomacy'' by
requiring him to give Congress 30 days' notice of agreements
involving NATO. He said he would regard those provisions as merely
``advisory.''
   Bush, who will not return to the White House until Monday, had
no special pre-summit briefings planned. His chief of staff John
Sununu, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater did not even accompany him to Maine.
   In addition to Skinner and his wife, Honey, the Bushes' weekend
guests included Houston friends Charles and Sally Neblett, and son
Marvin Bush, his wife Margaret and their children, Marshall and
Walker.

<HEAD>Washington Mayor Loses Round In Court; Says He's Ready For Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry says he's ready to go to
trial now that a judge refuses to drop the drug and perjury charges
against him or to throw out medical and videotaped evidence that he
allegedly used drugs.
   Defense attorneys argued on Friday that the government engaged
in prosecutorial vindictiveness by bringing six new drug charges
against the mayor May 10. They also argued that the government
engaged in impermissible conduct by having a cooperating government
witness lure Barry to the Vista Hotel on Jan. 18, where he
allegedly smoked crack cocaine.
   The mayor unsuccessfully sought to have the 14 criminal charges
against him dismissed and videotape and hair sample evidence
against him suppressed.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that
there was no evidence of vindictiveness. He also ruled that Barry's
actions at the Vista were voluntary, and not coerced by the
government.
   Defense R. Kenneth Mundy used statements by a cardiologist to
suggest that the FBI had endangered Barry's life by setting up the
sting operation.
   But ``no violence occurred, and no coercion was employed,'' said
Jackson.
   The judge did order the government to provide Barry with a list
of the alleged co-conspirators and the times and places of the
alleged cocaine possessions.
   Jackson also gave Barry until Tuesday to decide whether to seek
a separation of the six charges brought May 10, which would result
in a second trial at a later date.
   A June 4 trial is scheduled on 10 counts of cocaine possession,
one count of conspiracy and three felony charges of lying to a
federal grand jury.
   ``I feel very good about today,'' Barry said after the day of
pre-trial courtroom arguments, which he attended. ``We're ready to
go to trial.''
   The judge said the videotape of the hotel bedroom was lawfully
obtained with the permission of the hotel room's occupant, ex-model
Rasheeda Moore.
   Mundy said a hair sample taken from Barry after his arrest at
the Vista Hotel should be excluded. It tested positive for cocaine
residue.
   Mundy said the residue could be from someone else and that ``so
far, it's not a crime to be in a room'' where another person uses
cocaine.
   But the presence of cocaine in body specimens indicates
relatively recent ``ingestion'' of a substance, said Jackson, and
``may permit an inference of both a present familiarity ... and a
willingness to be using it again.''
   Jackson said he will reserve a ruling on whether the hair sample
will be admissible evidence at trial.

   Residents of rural Campbells Creek
figure their town went down a notch in the eyes of outsiders when
they were accused of bullying a local florist rumored to have AIDS.
   On Friday, after state and county officials said Bill Grealis
may have made up stories of beatings and threats against him,
residents said they had been in the spotlight long enough.
   ``I think it really gave us a black eye,'' said Anna Belle
Reynolds, 56, who operates a clothing store in Campbells Creek.
   ``I just want to see this over with ... There's been a lot of
negative publicity. It's been a real worry to me,'' she said.
   Grealis, 41, checked into a psychiatric ward in nearby
Charleston on Thursday, state officials said.
   Grealis had said he was terrorized by people in the small mining
community of 300 since last December, after he lost 50 pounds from
prostrate problems and split with his wife of 22 years.
   Grealis said he was nearly forced into bankruptcy and at one
point considered suicide because of the alleged smear campaign. He
said the tires of his van were slashed and ``AIDS'' scrawled on the
side of the vehicle.
   A week ago, Grealis said he was robbed, struck in the head and
had his left arm slashed by an unknown assailant. No arrests were
made.
   On May 14, Grealis and state Attorney General Roger Tompkins
announced at a news conference that Grealis was free of AIDS. The
florist posted his clean bill of health on the shop window.
   But on Thursday, prosecutor Bill Forbes disputed the man's
accusations and said he may have wounded himself. Carrie Webster, a
spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office, said the case
is being investigated.
   Grealis, who still contends that several of the attacks were
real, could not be reached for comment Friday. Officials at the
hospital where he is staying said they would not let him speak with
reporters.
   Rosalie Morris, 51, who works at Fas-Chek Super Market in
Campbells Creek, said many outsiders were unfairly basing their
opinions of the entire town on the incident.
   ``We get a bad reputation and there's a lot of good people up
here,'' she said. ``It's like anywhere else. There's good and bad
people.''
   Morris and others, however, said they wouldn't hold a grudge
against Grealis ``if the doctor really proves him sick.''

   Vanessa Williams, who lost the Miss America 1984
crown when it was disclosed she posed nude for Penthouse magazine,
says in a new magazine interview that relinquishing the title ``was
like a death in the family.''
   ``People sent flowers. The press camped out on our lawn. People
spray-painted obscenities on the driveway of the local A&amp;P,'' the
first black Miss America said in the June issue of Gentlemen's
Quarterly.
   ``But the hardest part was telling my parents about the
pictures,'' she said. ``I cried and told them I was sorry. They
said there was nothing to be sorry about.''
   With the help of her husband and business manager, Ramon Hervey,
Williams has developed a musical career. She achieved a
breakthrough in 1988 with the release of her rhythm and blues album
``The Right Stuff,'' which featured three hit singles.

   Paul McCartney will not be appearing at
the Yale Bowl after all, responding to residents of the area near
the stadium who bitterly opposed the concert.
   Mayor John Daniels initially blocked plans for the concert,

   A supermarket tabloid has paid undisclosed
damages to Tom Selleck's father for publishing statements falsely
attributed to him in an 1982 article detailing his son's alleged
``love secrets.''
   The Globe, a Florida-based weekly, published an apology this
week as part of a settlement of a $6 million libel lawsuit filed
seven years ago by Robert Selleck. The terms of the settlement were
not disclosed.
   The lawsuit concerned a Dec. 14, 1982, story headlined, ``Tom
Selleck's Love Secrets _ By His Father.'' Other headlines promised,
``His father reveals all'' about ``why Tom Selleck can never become
a happy lover.''
   Robert Selleck denied making any statements about his actor
son's love life.

   Thomas Monaghan, owner of Domino's Pizza
Inc. and the Detroit Tigers, wants to help rebuild a cathedral in
Nicaragua.
   Monaghan has invited 1,500 friends and associates to a June 11
fund-raiser at Domino's headquarters near Ann Arbor to raise funds
for rebuilding a cathedral destroyed in a 1972 earthquake in
Managua.
   Nicaragua Cardinal Obando y Bravo, seeking financial support in
the United States, first contacted Cardinal Richard Law of Boston,
who referred him to Monaghan.
   ``Obando and Law contacted Mr. Monaghan because they knew he was
a Catholic business leader, and they knew he would be interested
because he's already helping to build chapels in Honduras,'' said
Monaghan's daughter, Maggie.
   The Managua cathedral will cost $2 million to fix.
   Since 1988, the Domino's Foundation has financed two chapels in
rural Honduras.

   Funk rock singer, songwriter and producer
George Clinton was arrested for investigation of cocaine possession
after a small amount of the drug allegedly was found in a car he
was in, authorities said.
   Clinton, 45, former leader of the Funkadelics, a funk rock group
of the 1970s, was arrested early Friday with Archie Ray Ivy, 39, of
Inglewood, said sheriff's Deputy Bill Linnemeyer.
   Deputies stopped Ivy's 1977 Mercedes Benz because its headlights
were off, said Linnemeyer. He said deputies spotted the cocaine on
the car's floor between the two men.
   Clinton, a Michigan resident, was en route to his hotel after a
recording session, Linnemeyer said.
   Both men were booked and bail for each was set at $2,500.
Arraignment was tentatively scheduled for Tuesday in Inglewood
Municipal Court.
   During the 1970s, the Funkadelics and other permutations of the
band, including Parliament Funkadelic, recorded albums including
``Funkadelic,'' ``Free Your Mind,'' ``Maggot Brain'' and ``One
Nation Under a Groove.''

   Contra rebels broke off disarmament
talks Friday, accusing the Sandinista-dominated army of killing 14
disarmed guerrillas and 100 civilians in northern Nicaragua.
   The conservative government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
which succeeded the leftist Sandinista administration a month ago
but left Sandinistas in charge of the military, promised to look
into the report.
   Contra Commander Oscar Sobalvarro and other rebel leaders issued
a communique initially charging that five disarmed Contras were
killed and nine others were missing after a May 18 army massacre
near Waslala in Matagalpa province, 150 miles northeast of Managua.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Carlos Lara called the charges
``totally false.''
   A rebel delegation raised the later charges of 14 Contra and 100
civilian dead in a Friday night meeting with the government, said
Roberto Ferrey, one of the government representatives.
   ``If the charges bear out, the government is prepared to order
an exhaustive investigation and punishment sanctioning whoever
turns out to be responsible,'' said Ferrey.
   He said Mrs. Chamorro ordered an on-site investigation with the
participation of Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.
   The rebels learned of the incident Thursday, the same day that
disarmament talks with the government got under way, Sobalvarro
said in a news conference.
   ``The talks with the government are suspended indefinitely,
until the incident is investigated and those guilty of the massacre
of the demobilized rebels are punished,'' the Contra commander said.
   Lara branded the charges ``part of a Contra propaganda campaign
aimed at creating mistrust and insecurity among those who are
trying to demobilize and disarm according to agreements with the
government.''
   A May 4 agreement between Contras and the government set a June
10 deadline for 11,000 rebels to give up their weapons.
   But the Contra high command suspended disarmament on May 19, and
fewer than 1,500 fighters have been demobilized to date.
   Sovalbarro said Friday the high command will continue to
withhold orders for disarmament.
   The Contras, backed by the United States, fought the leftist
Sandinista government in a 10-year war that left 30,000 dead.
   Rebel fighters said they would give up their arms when Mrs.
Chamorro, backed by the United States, took over the presidency
from Sandinista President Daniel Ortega on April 25.
   But the high command changed its mind, saying its troops were
not receiving enough food, housing, jobs and security measures from
the government.
   The Contras say their chief concern is the threat of the army,
which is controlled mostly by Sandinistas.

<HEAD>Cheney Wants To Shuffle Defense Money To Avoid Firing Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney plans to shuffle
millions of dollars among the Pentagon's accounts to keep as many
as 68,000 of its employees from losing their jobs.
   Traditionally the defense secretary would make such a move with
the consent of key members of Congress, but Cheney says he plans to
go ahead with this regardless of whether all the necessary
lawmakers agree.
   ``We want to protect military personnel from the effects of
shortages in the manpower accounts,'' he said Friday. ``Last fall,
Congress said it expected us to pursue this kind of reprogramming,
and that's what I've been trying to do for the past five months.''
   The Pentagon has asked for authority to move $852 million from
other accounts to avoid the dismissal of military personnel by
October. Such a shift of funds from one pocket to another is known
in Washington jargon as a ``reprogramming.''
   Such shifts of money are customarily submitted to the chairmen
and ranking minority members of the House and Senate armed services
committees and the corresponding Appropriations defense
subcommittees.
   The Pentagon has estimated that without the reprogramming
authority, 44,100 to 68,200 military personnel would have to be
fired by Oct. 1. Between 32,000 and 36,000 people would be frozen
in their current jobs, 57,000 to 67,000 promotions would be
delayed, and 59,000 to 115,900 fewer men and women could be brought
into the armed forces.
   Cheney said he has the agreement of seven of the eight
lawmakers, with only Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, holding out.
   ``If no acceptable agreement can be worked out by the first week
Congress is back from its recess, then I will use the authority I
have to reprogram the necessary funds,'' said Cheney.
   ``I have agreed to make one more good faith effort and try to
reach a solution to which all eight chairmen and ranking members of
the key committees can agree,'' he said.
   Congress will return from recess June 5.
   Aspin was traveling and unavailable for comment. A committee
source, speaking on condition he not be identified, agreed the
Pentagon has the authority to move the funds around but said there
has been ``a gentlemen's agreement'' to consult with Congress.
``What Cheney is doing is trying to break the gentlemen's
agreement,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh took a
lie-detector test during an investigation into leaks to the media
from the U.S. Justice Department, The New York Times reported today.
   Thornburgh was believed to be the first attorney general to ever
take a polygraph exam, Bush Administration officials who were not
identified told the Times.
   He passed the test, which was conducted last September, the
Times said.
   The investigation involved Thornburgh's attempt to find the
source of an unauthorized disclosure to CBS News about an FBI
inquiry into financial irregularities at Rep. William H. Gray, D-Pa.
   Thornburgh took the polygraph at the request of Edward S.G.
Dennis Jr., head of the Justice Department's criminal division,
after investigators decided they needed to test all officials who
had access to the information about Gray, the Times said.
   Two of Thornburgh's top aides, David Runkel, his press
secretary, and Robert S. Ross Jr., his executive assistant, failed
lie-detector tests and were reassigned to lesser positions in the
Justice Department, the Times said.
   Neither was implicated as the primary source of the news leak,
the newspaper said.
   Two weeks ago, the Justice Department's second-highest official,
Donald B. Ayer, resigned in protest over what he said was an
attempt by Thornburgh to shield the aides from the inquiry.
   Thornburgh told the Times he considered the matter closed and
that he and his staff had been cleared of any wrongdoing.
   Nobody answered the telephone Friday night at the home of a
Justice Department spokesman, Dan Eramian, but the Times said
department officials had declined to comment.

   Communist rebels armed with assault rifles and
dynamite forced shoppers to loot two large downtown stores, police
said.
   A band of 20 guerrillas rounded up employees of a department
store and a shoe store on Friday and ordered shoppers to take
whatever they wanted, police said.
   The guerrillas, members of the Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement, left five sticks of dynamite in front of
one of the stores before escaping into the capital's streets filled
with rush-hour crowds.
   Ten of the rebels were armed with assault rifles and submachine
guns, while the rest carried sticks of dynamite, police said.
   The Tupac Amaru band took up arms in 1984. It is smaller and
less radical than the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who control
much of Peru's mountain and jungle regions.
   More than 18,000 people have died in political violence in the
last decade.

   The bodies of 50 endangered
penguins were found floating in the flooded hold of a Taiwanese
fishing trawler that ran aground, environmental officials said.
   The carcasses of the Jackass penguins had been individually
packaged in plastic bags, the officials said Friday.
   The fishing trawler An Hung ran aground on the rocky
southwestern coast of South Africa early Tuesday, and 15
crewmembers were rescued by helicopter. One was found dead on the
beach Tuesday.
   The Jackass penguin is unique to the southern African coast and
is protected under South African law. Its population has diminished
after centuries of being hunted.
   Its natural habitat has been diminished by fishing and the
collection of the guano the bird uses to build its nests.

<HEAD>Lawyer Who Ditched Plane Over Atlantic Faces FCC Disbarment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington attorney who ditched his plane
in the Atlantic Ocean last summer has been ordered to show why he
shouldn't be disbarred from practicing before the Federal
Communications Commission.
   In the meantime, Thomas L. Root has been suspended from
practicing law before the commission, the FCC said Friday.
   The commission said it took the action because the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia entered an order April 12
disbarring Root by consent. FCC rules require that attorneys
practicing before it not be under any disbarment order.
   Telephone calls to Root's office Friday went unanswered.
   In March, Root was indicted on 33 counts of fraud and other
crimes involving radio stations he was representing before the FCC.
   The federal indictment accused Root of defrauding the government
and five clients in FCC proceedings on permits to construct FM
radio stations throughout the United States.
   Root gained notoriety last July when his single-engine plane ran
out of fuel and plunged into the Atlantic off the Bahamas following
a six-hour, 800-mile flight that began near Washington.
   He told authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the
odyssey, but Navy fighter pilots flying alongside the plane
reported seeing him move in the cockpit.
   When he was taken to a Florida hospital, Root was found to have
suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
   Less than a week after the crash, Sonrise Management Services of
Columbus, Ga., sued Root for $584,000, claiming he failed to
perform work and double-billed a client.
   Root filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors in
October 1989, claiming he had $1.64 million in liabilities.

<HEAD>The King is Definitely Dead _ And It's Suicide?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is no supermarket tabloid, it's the cover
of Life magazine: ``Thirteen years after the death of ELVIS PRESLEY
new evidence points to an inescapable conclusion _ SUICIDE.''
   The King of Rock 'n' Roll _ rumored to be alive ever since his
August 1977 death _ actually killed himself with a massive drug
overdose, Presley's controversial biographer claimed Friday.
   Writer Albert Goldman's story for Life is based in part on
information from Elvis' stepbrother, who was among the first to see
Presley's body after the singer died in his Memphis mansion,
Graceland.
   ``It's the dream gone to nightmare. It's perfect, it's the
archetypal rags to riches to rot story,'' Goldman said as advance
copies of his magazine cover story were released to the media.
   A private autopsy conducted following Presley's death put the
cause of death as a heart attack. Through years of rumors about his
death, including some saying Elvis staged his own funeral, the
Presley estate has stuck with that finding.
   A phone call to Graceland for comment on Goldman's claim from
the Presley estate was not returned.
   Goldman stunned and infuriated millions of Presley fans around
the world with his 1981 biography, ``Elvis,'' which portrayed the
King as an obese, impotent, drug addict incapable of taking care of
himself. Another unflattering Goldman biography, ``The Lives of
John Lennon,'' had the same effect on his fans.
   In ``Elvis,'' Goldman asserted that Presley had died of an
accidental overdose. But he said subsequent conversations with
David Stanley, Elvis' stepbrother and a fixture at Graceland,
convinced him that Presley committed suicide.
   Stanley says he knew all along it was a self-inflicted death,
but he had trouble accepting it.
   ``I was willing to protect Elvis as far as last year. But with
the constant bombardment of Elvis is alive stories, I came to the
conclusion that the best way to deal with things was reality,''
Stanley said Friday at a news conference at the Time &amp; Life
Building.
   The day he died, Elvis had consumed three packets of assorted
drugs at once along with some codeine; the doses were usually
spread out over eight hours, Stanley said.
   Goldman points to Elvis' physical deterioration, his drug
addiction and his depression over a tell-all book written by
ex-bodyguards Red and Sonny West with Steve Dunleavy as three
factors in the alleged suicide.
   Dunleavy, a reporter for Fox's ``A Current Affair,'' called the
allegations ``absolute garbage'' in an episode of the program that
aired Friday.
   Goldman said Presley had also attempted suicide once before _ on
the eve of his marriage to Priscilla Beaulieu.
   Stanley, himself a recovering drug addict, said that two days
before Elvis' death, the King indicated that he was not much longer
for this world.
   ``He stood up in his bed, and started hugging me and crying.
Then he told me, 'David, I'm never going to see you again. The next
time we meet will be in a different place,''' Stanley recalled.
   Goldman said Stanley's story prompted more research, and he
quickly became convinced Elvis had killed himself: ``I began to
see, uh-oh, boy, you've got the last 18 months wrong. Because this
guy was three-quarters dead before he blew out the flame.''
   Robert Pondiscio, a spokesman for Life, said the magazine's
editors did not believe it was necessary to take extraordinary
steps to verify Goldman's research because of his background as the
singer's biographer. Routine fact-checking was done, he said.
   ``Albert Goldman is Elvis' biographer of record, for better or
worse,'' Pondiscio said. ``This is the type of story that can't be
ignored.''

<HEAD>Proposal Would Admit Homosexuals As Reform Rabbis But Advise
Reticence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reform Judaism, one of the three major Jewish
branches in the United States, is considering lifting age-old
barriers against ordaining homosexuals as rabbis.
   But homosexual rabbis would be warned about dangers of making
their sexual preference public.
   Reform Judaism, with 1.5 million members nationwide, would be
the first U.S. Jewish branch to take allow homosexual rabbis.
   Adoption of the new ordination guidelines would go against
traditional Jewish emphasis on procreation and aversion to
homosexuality, dating to pre-biblical times.
   The proposal was drafted by a 17-member committee of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, representing the nation's 1,560
Reform rabbis, after four years of study, hearings and debate.
   Rabbi Joseph B. Glaser, the conference's executive vice
president, said Friday he expects the proposal to be approved
during the group's convention June 24-28 in Seattle.
   ``It's a well-balanced statement, finely tuned and sensitive to
our concerns,'' he said. It ``sets a middle ground,'' approving
ordination of homosexuals in a roundabout way.
   ``We ordain people who are qualified and decent and we're saying
if they happen to be gay, it's not any business of ours. We're not
making an issue of it. We're saying it's not an issue.''
   The proposal urges that ``all rabbis, regardless of sexual
orientation, be accorded the opportunity to fulfill their sacred
vocation which they have chosen.''
   But rabbis who are homosexual would be cautioned about making
their orientation public, as it ``can have grave professional
consequences.''
   ``The unique position of the rabbi as spiritual leader and
Judaic role model make the acceptance of gay or lesbian rabbis an
intensely emotional and potentially divisive issue,'' the proposal
said.
   Glaser said there was an ancient and ``basic Jewish abhorrence
of homosexuality'' derived from Judaism's emphasis on procreation
and perpetuating the human seed.
   ``That was the first commandment,'' he noted, citing God's
injunction in the Book of Genesis to ``be fruitful and multiply'' _
something impossible in homosexual unions.
   The Conservative wing of U.S. Judaism, with 1,300 rabbis and 1.5
million followers, advised Reform colleagues against the new stand.
The Orthodox branch, representing an estimated 1 million followers,
also strongly condemns homosexuality.
   An estimated 2 million American Jews are not affiliated with any
of the three branches of U.S. Judaism.
   The proposed Reform policy says:
   ``All human beings are created betselem elohim (in the divine
image). Their personhood must therefore be accorded full dignity.
Sexual orientation is irrelevant to the human worth of a person.''
   The proposed new stand is based on a recently announced
admissions policy of Reform Judaism's Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion of Cincinnati and New York.
   Glaser said, ``There probably are quite a lot of homosexuals
already in the ministry, as rabbis, ministers and priests.''
   Citing scientific uncertainty about the origins of all
homosexuality, the statement says, ``There are some people for whom
heterosexual, monogamous procreative marriage is not a viable
option or possibility.''
   It adds: ``The majority of the committee reaffirms unequivocally
the centrality of monogamous, heterosexual procreative marriage and
its special status as kiddushin (sanctified marriage).
   ``Therefore, in the case of a person for whom sexual identity is
a matter of choice, the majority of the committee affirms that
heterosexuality is the only appropriate Jewish choice.''
   A committee minority maintained that even where choice is
possible, ``homosexual relationships are equally'' legitimate and
that ``the relationship, not the gender of people, should determine
its Jewish value.''

<TEXT>
   A commodities dealer was ordered to pay $2
million for destroying 86 acres of wetlands on his hunting retreat
and, in what the judge called ``restitution for birds,'' was barred
from hunting wild fowl.
   The penalties were the largest financial sanctions ever levied
against a person in an environmental criminal case, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jane Barrett said.
   Multimillionaire investment counselor Paul Tudor Jones II, 35,
pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court to one misdemeanor
count of violating the Clean Water Act for filling in the wetlands
on his Maryland property with 1,400 cubic yards of gravel without a
permit.
   Under a plea bargain, Jones was fined $1 million, ordered to pay
$1 million in restitution to the National Fish and Wildlife
Foundation and ordered to restore the 86 acres he destroyed,
Barrett said.
   U.S. District Judge Frederick Smalkin also banned Jones from
hunting migratory birds anywhere in the United States through 1991.
He was placed on 18 months probation and restricted from developing
2,500 acres of his 3,272-acre estate.
   Jones faced up to one year in prison.
   Wetlands are considered crucial to the health of Chesapeake Bay
because they filter pollutants and provide habitat for wildlife.
   ``The message this sends is clear _ that those who destroy
wetlands will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. That
is very good news for the Chesapeake Bay and other coastal
waters,'' said William Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay
Foundation.
   In a statement Friday, Jones said the problem arose because he
had gotten erroneous advice.
   ``We believed, in error, that our experts had properly addressed
the complex issues related to habitat development in wetlands,'' he
said.
   Breckinridge L. Willcox, the U.S. attorney for Maryland, said
the case is the largest wetlands case ever filed in the United
States.
   Jones bought the waterfront estate, now valued at $20 million,
in August 1987, Barrett said. The property included 1,742 acres of
marshlands and wetlands at the time.
   The property is northwest of the Black Water National Wildlife
Refuge, a sanctuary for geese and duck and home to one of the
state's largest populations of bald eagles.
   Prosecutors said Jones was warned repeatedly in 1987 by his own
consultant, Gregg Moore, to stop work at the site until he received
permits from the Army Corps of Engineers.
   The corps told the project manager, William Ellen, in February
1988 after inspecting the site twice to stop filling in the
wetlands until a permit was obtained, according to court documents.
   Ellen, 44, of Matthews, Va., was indicted Friday on six counts
of violating the Clean Water Act for filling the wetlands at Tudor
Farms without permits and one count of violating the Rivers and
Harbors Act by placing fill material in navigable waters without a
permit, the U.S. Attorney's office said.
   Jones owns Tudor Investment Corp., which deals in commodities
and financial futures trading. He topped Financial World magazine's
1988 list of the 100 highest-paid people in the investment
business, with earnings of $80 million to $100 million in 1987. He
reportedly made another $30 million in 1988.

<HEAD>Federal Government Suing Ohio For Overcharging Army For Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government wants Ohio's National
Guard to return the $2 million it allegedly overcharged the Army
and to pay some $6.4 million in penalties and damages.
   In a rare lawsuit filed against the state, the Justice
Department said Ohio ``routinely knowingly mischarged and
overcharged the National Guard Bureau for the costs of labor
through several different fraudulent practices.''
   The $8.4 million lawsuit, filed under the False Claims Act,
accuses the Ohio state government of overcharging the Army's
National Guard Bureau for the costs of labor, utilities and
materials at Camp Perry in northwest Ohio.
   Under the law, the federal government may seek treble damages _
in this case $6 million _ for alleged overcharges. The suit also
seeks $2.4 million in penalties for 229 alleged instances of false
claims between 1980 and 1987.
   The False Claims Act is commonly used against private
contractors for overbilling the government for goods and services.
Its use against a state government is ``extremely rare,'' Justice
Department spokesman Michael Robinson said on Friday.
   Brig. Gen. Thomas Schulte, an assistant adjutant general of the
Ohio National Guard, said: ``I haven't seen the complaint so I
can't comment. We'll have our attorneys take a look at that and go
from there.''
   Maj. Gen. Richard C. Alexander, adjutant general of the Ohio
National Guard, declined to comment directly on the suit, but said
the Guard had reached a settlement with the Army in 1988.
   ``A Defense Contract Audit Agency audit ... had a finding
against us of $4.1 million in disallowed costs going back to
1978,'' Alexander said Friday night.
   ``Rather than take the matter legally, we were suggested to
informally settle with the Army. We did that. There was an
agreement to pay the federal government $1 million over a five-year
period. ... DCAA made no move and the Justice Department came in.''
   D. Michael Crites, U.S. attorney for the southern district of
Ohio, said Friday night that the Army has no authority to settle
cases involving the False Claims Act.
   ``This suit is a necessary action to ensure that the government,
and in turn the taxpayers, get what they pay for,'' said Stuart M.
Gerson, assistant attorney general for the civil division.
   Among other things, the lawsuit accuses Ohio of billing the
National Guard Bureau $315,568 between 1981 and 1987 for the costs
of annual rifle matches that were staged by the Army's director of
civilian marksmanship.
   ``In spite of the fact that the state knew that these costs had
been billed to, or were to be billed to, the director of civilian
marksmanship, the state submitted vouchers for the same costs to
the National Guard Bureau,'' said the complaint filed in federal
court in Columbus.
   The National Guard Bureau was charged $315,568 between 1981 and
1987 for expenses that were also paid by the director of civilian
marksmanship, the complaint alleged.
   The lawsuit also accuses Ohio of mischarging or overcharging the
Pentagon $498,500 worth of labor costs between 1978 and 1987.
   The state charged the National Guard Bureau for the overtime of
federal workers it had assigned to perform tasks unrelated to the
Army's use of the camp.
   The suit also charges that the state billed the National Guard
Bureau $270,666 for fuel oil and electricity for heating buildings
that were not used by the Army.

<HEAD>Controversial Photo Exhibit Moving On</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A photo exhibit by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe was ending its seven-week run today at an art gallery
that was indicted for displaying it.
   More than 75,000 visitors viewed ``The Perfect Moment,'' a
display of 175 photos, at the Contemporary Arts Center.
   Five of the photos depicted homosexual acts and two showed
frontal nudity of children, prompting a Hamilton County grand jury
to indict the gallery and its director, Dennis Barrie, on
misdemeanor obscenity charges last month.
   The case remains unresolved. Judge David J. Albanese of Hamilton
County Municipal Court has yet to rule on pretrial issues,
including what evidence may be admitted in the trial and whether
the grand jury received proper instructions from prosecutors.
   The indictments fueled public interest in the exhibit. Lines
during the last week at the arts center were long, as usual. Robert
Brasier, a gallery attendant collecting admission fees, said the
museum had more than 4,600 patrons Thursday and Friday.
   ``This is like the first day,'' Brasier said Friday.
   Even before it reached Cincinnati, the Mapplethorpe exhibit
prompted a national debate over freedom of artistic expression. The
Hamilton County indictments were the first criminal charges brought
in the dispute, however.
   ``Cincinnati has become a microcosm of what is happening all
over America,'' Barrie said.
   In June, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., showed copies of the most
controversial photographs from ``The Perfect Moment'' to members of
Congress, and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., canceled
its showing of the exhibit.
   But the exhibit was show in six other cities without incident.
   In Cincinnati, the exhibit had a preview showing April 6 for
arts center members. When it opened for the public the next day,
spectators included the grand jury, and police temporarily closed
the gallery to videotape the photographs.
   U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin issued a temporary restraining
order April 8, barring law-enforcement officials from closing the
exhibit until the obscenity question was resolved in court.
   The exhibit now goes to the Boston Institute of Contemporary
Art, where it is to open Aug. 1. Institute director David Ross said
he expected a quieter reaction than Cincinnati's.

<HEAD>Striptease Enjoys Same Protection as Ballet, Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striptease dancing may be bad art, but no matter
how the dancers remove their clothes, they're still covered by the
constitution, a federal appeals court ruled.
   The decision released Friday by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals found that Indiana cannot use a statute banning public
indecency to prohibit nude dancing in taverns and strip joints.
   ``Though this dance is clearly of inferior artistic and
aesthetic quality as contrasted with a classic ballet as the Dance
of the Seven Veils in Strauss' `Salome,' the erotic message
communicated to the viewers is present in both performances,'' said
Judge Joel Flaum, who wrote the majority opinion in the 7-4
decision.
   Indiana authorities had not argued that the dancing was obscene,
and the ruling did not protect forms of dance deemed obscene.
   However, ``that Strauss' `Salome' tells a compelling story and
the nude dancing at the Kitty Kat Lounge may not is not
determinative,'' Flaum wrote. ``Expression does not lose its
protection for lack of a scripted plot.''
   Three dancers and their employers, J.R.'s Kitty Kat Lounge and
the Glen Theatre, both in South Bend, had challenged the Indiana
law.
   In dissent, Judge John L. Coffey said the framers of the
Constitution never intended for the First Amendment to protect nude
dancing.
   ``No less than in the contexts of abortion and other important
questions of present concern, we are required to permit the people
of each state to establish, through their democratically elected
representatives, the moral climate in which they choose to live and
raise their children,'' Coffey wrote.
   A spokesman for Indiana Attorney General Linley Pearson said the
decision would likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``Our office has been diligent in pursuing states' rights
issues,'' said the spokesman, Dan Foley. ``We feel that community
standards in Indiana are different from places like New York or San
Francisco.''

on the insanity and derangement of the whole system, a system which

   William Cooper, identified only as an ex-Marine who fought in
the Vietnam War, went on trial Friday in the Cuban province of

<TEXT>
   In the final days of a long election
campaign marred by bloody attacks by drug traffickers and leftist
guerrillas, a new wave of bombings and shootings has killed dozens
of people.
   In the latest violence, a car bomb blast in a Bogota
neighborhood late Friday night seriously injured four people and
heavily damaged dozens of homes.
   A leading presidential candidate in Sunday's election proposed
that cocaine be legalized in the United States and other countries
to wrest profits from drug traffickers.
   ``The legalization of cocaine in the world would resolve the
problem in Colombia,'' Alvaro Gomez, a center-right candidate for
the National Salvation Movement, told a news conference.
   The election front-runner is Cesar Gaviria of the governing
Liberal Party, who says there should be no negotiations with drug
bosses. The other three candidates have proposed at least some kind
of accommodation with them.
   No one immediately claimed reponsibility for the car bombing
Friday night but suspicion fell on drug traffickers blamed for the
deaths of more than 250 people since August. Two of three
assassinations of presidential hopefuls have been blamed on drug
traffickers.
   The Aug. 18 assassination of then-leading presidential hopeful
Luis Carlos Galan, of the Liberal Party, prompted a crackdown in
which authorities have extradited drug suspects to the United
States and seized the property of traffickers.
   Government officials say the drug barons are apparently stepping
up their terror attacks to scare people away from the polls on
Sunday. The army said this week that leftist guerrillas also aim to
disrupt the balloting.
   Since Thursday a wave of bombings and murders in the cocaine
capital of Medellin has left 22 people dead and 27 injured. Eight
bombs have exploded in Colombia in the last two weeks, killing a
total of 34 people and injuring more than 320.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel has offered $4,300 for every police
officer killed. So far this month, 33 have been assassinated,
police said.
   The army and police said they were mobilizing about 230,000
troops to ensure peaceful elections.
   Bogota is an armed camp. Military checkpoints line major streets
and highways, and armored personnel carriers mounted with machine
guns patrol the cities. Soldiers are everywhere.
   It is difficult to have a conversation with a Colombian these
days without the subject getting around to bombs and other
terrorist acts.
   ``The violence is keeping people away from public areas and
overwhelmingly reducing their activities. It might also keep people
at home for the elections,'' Camilo Castellanos, a social
scientist, told The Associated Press.
   A low voter turnout could wrest legitimacy from the winner. That
may be exactly what the perpetrators of the violence are seeking in
their campaigns to destabilize politics, officials say.
   The current president, Virgilio Barco, is barred by the
constitution from seeking a second consecutive term.
   Security concerns have prevented many candidates from appearing
in public, forcing them to conduct their campaigns through
television and radio.
   ``These are the most tense and difficult elections in Colombian
history,'' Antonio Navarro, the presidential candidate for the
left-wing M-19 party, told reporters Wednesday.
   Navarro took over as M-19 candidate after his predecessor,
Carlos Pizarro, was murdered in April by an assailant who shot him
to death on a commercial jetliner over Bogota. It is unclear
whether drug traffickers killed him.
   The other assassinated presidential candidate was leftist
Bernardo Jaramillo, who was killed March 22. Police said he was
killed by the Medellin cartel.
   In Medellin, five bodies, with hands and feet bound, were found
Friday on a highway, the police spokeswoman said. The police have
not been able to identify the victims.
   A 44-pound bomb exploded Friday morning at an office building in
a wealthy Medellin neighborhood, the spokeswoman said. Three people
were hurt, and nearby apartments and stores were damaged.
   She said one of the three assassinated police officers was shot
to death on her way to work Friday morning.
   On Thursday, a powerful car bomb blew up at a police post
outside the luxury Intercontinental Hotel, killing five people and
injuring 22, police said. Three of the dead were police officers.
   The police spokeswoman said unidentified attackers also stormed
a Medellin office Thursday night, fatally shooting three men and
two women.
   That same night, four people were murdered elsewhere in the
city, she said.
   Military spokesman Col. Eduardo Arevalo on Wednesday said the
rebel National Liberation Army on Tuesday kidnapped two mayors, two
mayors-elect, and three city councilmen in the northwestern state
of Antioquia.
   The Bogota daily newspaper El Tiempo, citing military sources,
reported this week that the National Liberation Army and another
insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, are
planning to sabotage presidential elections.

<HEAD>Railway Strike Spreads to South America's Largest City.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike against the government-owned
railroad has spread to South America's largest city, and the
president of the Federal Railroad System has quit to protest mass
layoffs due to austerity cuts.
   In Sao Paulo close to 10,000 railroad workers walked off the job
Friday, grinding commuter and cargo transportation to a halt. About
1 million commuters were forced to use other means of
transportation or stay home.
   The trains are used mostly by poor residents of the outlying
suburbs and slums to get to work in downtown Sao Paulo, with a
metropolitan area population of more than 15 million.
   Many commuters crowded into the extra buses placed into
circulation by the municipal government. Others resorted to car
pools, hitched rides or simply stayed home.
   In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's No. 2 city, 11,000 railroad employee
stayed off away from work for the second day, said Genaldo
Porfirio, public relations director of the Federal Railway System.
Some 700,000 commuters were affected.
   The walkout also affected railway transportation in the states
of Bahia, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul and Alagoas.
   The strikers are protesting a plan to fire about 18,000 of
Brazil's 88,000 railway workers.
   Late Thursday the president of the Federal Railway System,
Francisco Mario Chiesa, and his administrative director, Almir
Braga, resigned over disagreement about the layoffs.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello recently annnounced a plan to
fire close to 400,000 federal employees. He said the cuts were
needed to end a $31 billion budget deficit, seen as a main cause of
inflation that until recently galloped along at 4,000 percent.
   In Rio, oil workers also voted to strike June 6 in protest
against the planned firing of 16,000 of the company's 60,000
employees.
   The Central Workers Union, a radical left federation of labor
unions that claims to represent some 12 million workers, was
planning a nationwide general strike on June 6.

<HEAD>Former Hawaii Governor Says He Returned Cash Payment From Imelda
Marcos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. George Ariyoshi denied a report that
he accepted a $50,000 cash payment from Imelda Marcos when the
former Philippine first lady visited Hawaii in 1982.
   In a written statement Friday, Ariyoshi said Mrs. Marcos tried
to give him cash. But he said he returned the money.
   ``I have not done anything wrong and this unfortunate incident
was not one of my making,'' said Ariyoshi, who returned here from
Japan on Friday.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting Mrs. Marcos' travel expense logs
that were entered as evidence at her federal racketeering trial in
New York, last Saturday reported that Ariyoshi received the payment
three days after the Democrat announced his intention to run for
re-election.
   Ariyoshi said he was unable to recall the date. ``But at some
time, some gifts were left at Washington Place,'' Hawaii's
governor's mansion, he said.
   Ariyoshi said he found money in an envelope inside one of the
packages.
   ``I immediately decided to return it and rewrapped it,''
Ariyoshi said. ``I did not want to touch the money and I do not
know how much there was.''
   Ariyoshi said he returned the money to Mrs. Marcos and suggested
she donate the money to agencies benefiting Filipinos in Hawaii.
   Mrs. Marcos has denied making the payment.
   ``Mrs. Marcos has stated that she never delivered any money to
Gov. Ariyoshi and that's our position,'' said Ben Cassiday, an
attorney for Mrs. Marcos. ``If Gov. Ariyoshi has a different
position, that's fine. I have no idea of really what he's talking
about.''
   Mrs. Marcos is on trial in federal court in New York, charged
with embezzlement and fraud. She is accused of helping her late
husband, former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, steal more
than $220 million from their country's treasury.
   State records show Ariyoshi, who served as governor from 1974 to
1986, did not report a payment from Mrs. Marcos as a campaign
contribution. Either way, such a large contribution would be
illegal.
   Ariyoshi's name appears on Mrs. Marcos' log in a July 1982 entry
during a trip Mrs. Marcos made to the Soviet Union, Morocco and the
United States, the Times said.
   On a page listing ``cash disbursements'' for July, 20, 1982, is
a brief handwritten entry: ``$50,000 _ Given to Gov. Ariyoshi,''
the Times said.
   The logs are written in notebooks in which a private secretary
to Mrs. Marcos, identified in testimony as longtime aide Fe Roa
Gimenez, maintained a running account of expenses incurred by Mrs.
Marcos and her entourage during trips abroad, the Times said.
   Ariyoshi, now a private attorney, is a longtime friend of Mrs.
Marcos and her husband, who died in exile in Honolulu in September
1989.
   Ariyoshi was at Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu to greet the
Marcoses in February 1986 when they fled the Philippines after an
uprising that swept President Corazon Aquino to power.

<HEAD>U.N. Panel Urges Cutting Related Emissions By More Than Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. scientific panel has called for drastic
cuts in emissions that cause global warming, saying temperatures
will otherwise rise faster in the next century than in the past
10,000 years.
   The report Friday by the respected committee could help shift
international debate from whether global warming exists to how to
combat it. The United States and Japan have been skeptical of the
phenomenon and reluctant to take action.
   Global warming is the process by which so-called ``greenhouse
gases'' _ such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons _ collect
on the outer edges of the Earth's atmosphere and trap heat within.
   The emission of some gases must be cut by more than half simply
to stabilize the situation, or the warming will be even faster, the
U.N. report said.
   As it is, the scientists predicted, the overall increase in
temperatures in the next century will be greater than that of the
previous 10,000 years combined. The rising temperatures could cause
sea levels to rise more than two feeet by the end of the next
century, they said.
   The report was one of three being prepared by working groups of
the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which called
on the expertise of about 1,000 scientists around the world.
   The two other working groups are preparing reports on the
effects of global warming, including dangerous climatic change they
say will cause rising seas; the spread of disease; and widespread
starvation in poor countries.
   The three reports will be presented in November at the World
Climate Conference in Geneva.
   The scientists said global temperatures will likely increase
about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 35 years and 5.4 degrees
before the end of the next century. Sea levels were predicted to
rise by 2.3 inches each decade. That would come to 8 inches by the
year 2030, and more than two feet by the end of the next century.
   Martin Houlgate, a former chief scientist with Britain's
Environment Department, said the study suggests that failing to
take action could be dangerous.
   ``The implications of inaction are far more serious than the
risks of taking action now and finding that not all our projections
were sound,'' he said on British Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   Dan Lashoff of the Washington D.C.-based Natural Resources
Defense Council, said with the new report, the Bush administration
``will no longer be able to pick its favorite scientific skeptics
as an excuse for not reducing U.S. emissions.''
   The United States has called for more study of global warming
before it imposes measures to fight it.
   After the report's release, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
urged a ``giant international effort'' to deal with the threat. She
pledged Britain to reducing projected carbon dioxide emissions by
30 percent by the year 2005.
   But the United Nations report said cuts in carbon dioxide
emissions should be twice as large, and must take effect
immediately.
   ``There must be immediate cuts of more than 60 percent in the
output of long-lived gases _ carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and
chlorofluorocarbons _ to stabilize their concentrations at today's
levels,'' the scientists said.
   Means of cutting the emissions include improving energy
efficiency and substituting natural gas and other ``clean'' fuels
for high-carbon fuels like coal and oil.
   Other suggested steps included: improving public transportation
and traffic management; reducing industrial emissions; promoting
tree planting and discouraging deforestation; and providing aid and
training to developing countries to encourage the use of
energy-efficient technologies.
   West Germany has proposed a 25 percent reduction in carbon
dioxide by 2005. The Netherlands have agreed to stabilize emissions
by 1995. France, Italy, Denmark and most of the other 12 members of
the European Community favor a proposal that will be discussed at a
meeting next month to stablize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990
levels by the year 2000.

<HEAD>Excerpts from Global Warning Report</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Global Warming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some excerpts from the report by the U.N.
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group I, entitled
``Scientific Assessment of Climate Change.'' The ``executive
summary'' of the report was distributed Friday by the British
Central Office of Information:
   We are certain of the following:
   _There is a natural greenhouse effect which already keeps the
Earth warmer than it would otherwise be.
   _Emissions resulting from human activities are substantially
increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases:
carbon dioxide, methane, the chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide.
   These increases will enhance the greenhouse effect, resulting on
average in an additional warming of the Earth's surface.
   The main greenhouse gas, water vapor, will increase in response
to global warming and further enhance it.
   We calculate with confidence that:
   _Some gases are potentially more effective than others at
changing climate, and their relative effectiveness can be
estimated. Carbon dioxide has been responsible for over half the
enhanced greenhouse effect in the past, and is likely to remain so
in the future.
   _Atmospheric concentrations of the long-lived gases adjust only
slowly to changes in emissions. Continued emissions of these gases
at present rates would commit us to increased concentrations for
decades to centuries. The longer emissions continue to increase at
present day rates, the greater reductions would have to be for
concentrations to stabilize at a given level.
   _The long-lived gases would require immediate reductions in
emissions from human activities of over 60 percent to stabilize
their concentrations at today's levels. Methane would require a
15-20 percent reduction.
   Based on current model results, we predict:
   _Under the IPCC Business-as-Usual scenario of emissions of
greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of global mean temperature
during the next century of about 0.3 degrees C. per decade (with an
uncertainty range of 0.2 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C per decade).
   This is greater than that seen over the past 10,000 years. This
will result in a likely increase in global mean temperature of
about 1 degree C above the present value by 2025 and 3 degrees C
before the end of the next century.
   The rise will not be steady because of the influence of other
factors.
   _That land surfaces warm more rapidly than the ocean, and high
northern latitudes warm more than global mean in winter.
   _Regional climate changes differ from the global mean, although
our confidence in the prediction of the detail of regional changes
is low.
   For example, temperature increases in southern Europe and
central North America are predicted to be higher than the global
mean, accompanied on average by reduced summer precipitation and
soil moisture.
   There are less consistent predictions for the tropics and the
southern hemisphere.
   _Under the IPCC Business-as-Usual Emissions scenario, an average
rate of global mean sea level rise of about 6 centimeters per
decade over the next century (with an uncertainty range of 3-10
centimeters per decade), mainly due to thermal expansion of the
oceans and the melting of some land ice.
   This amounts to a rise of about 20 centimeters in global mean
sea level by 2030, and 65 centimeters by the end of the century.
There will be significant regional variations.
   There are many uncertainties in our predictions particularly
with regard to the timing, magnitude and regional patterns of
climate change.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Nazi War Crime Suspect Innocent; Jewish Groups Call For
Retrial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In Canada's first war crimes trial, a jury has
acquitted a man charged with manslaughter and other atrocities
against thousands of Jews in Nazi-occupied Hungary during World War
II. Jewish leaders called for a retrial.
   Imre Finta, 77, who had shown little emotion as he sat in the
prisoner's box during the six-month trial, broke down and cried
when he heard the verdict Friday.
   Finta had been charged with confinement, kidnapping, robbery and
manslaughter in the rounding up and deportation of 8,617 Jewish
civilians from Hungary in June 1944.
   ``Nobody believes Finta a Nazi,'' he said sobbing, after being
cleared of all charges. ``I love the Jewish people. ... My (former)
fiancee was Jewish.''
   The Ontario Supreme Court jury of eight women and four men
returned its verdict following 12{ hours of deliberations over two
days.
   The native of Hungary, Finta became a Canadian citizen after the
war and is now retired from the restaurant business in Toronto. He
was a captain in the Hungarian police when the Jews were deported.
   Identification was a key question at the trial. Finta's lawyer
Doug Christie said there was no proof Finta was the uniformed
officer some witnesses claimed had been giving orders.
   The charges alleged Finta was in command when the Jews were
rounded up at a brickyard in the village of Szeged, forced aboard
squalid boxcars and transported to labor camps in other
Nazi-occupied countries.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center of Los Angeles said in a statement
that it was ``deeply disappointed'' by the acquittal, adding it
``hopes that the judicial authorities will proceed with any and all
appeals open to them in this case.''
   ``We're in a state of shock,'' said Frank Dimant of B'nai B'rith
Canada. ``It's exceptionally painful to us in light of the rising
anti-Semitism internationally and in Canada.''
   Dimant, executive vice-president of the group, urged Canadian
federal officials to appeal the decision and said his
organization's lawyers are analyzing legal grounds for a retrial.
   In 1986, Jules Deschenes, the former chief justice of Quebec
Superior Court who headed a government inquiry into war crimes,
said there was evidence to warrant immediate prosecutions against
at least 20 war crime suspects in Canada.
   The following year, Parliament passed its war crimes
legislation, which empowers the government to make retroactive
war-crime charges in war-associated offenses that occurred in
another country.
   Finta was the first person charged under Canada's 1987
legislation on war crimes and crimes against humanity.
   The two others charged under Canada's war crimes law _ Stephen
Reistetter of St. Catharines, Ontario, and Michael Pawlowski of
Renfrew, Ontario, near Ottawa, have not yet gone to trial.
   Reistetter, 75, is charged with kidnapping and unlawfully
transporting 3,000 Jews from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia while he
was a government official during the war.
   Pawlowski, 72, is charged in the 1942 deaths of 490 people in
Byelorussia, the western Soviet Union.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ex-Nazi SS soldier whose
ultrarightist party was a growing political force until recently
has quit as party leader because he says extremists have taken over.
   Franz Schoenhuber, 66, said after resigning Friday that a
``small clique of extremist functionaries'' existed at top party
levels and that he was not responsible for recent clashes between
police and party members.
   Mainstream politicians in Bonn said his decision marks the
near-certain demise of one of Europe's most controversial political
parties, which went from a mushrooming political force to a fringe
group in disarray.
   Otto Lambsdorff, head of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior
coalition partners, the Free Democrats, said Friday, ``The remains
... of this party will soon scatter themselves into the wind.''
   The Republicans' main office in Munich said Schoenhuber's former
deputy, Johanna Grund, 56, will replace him until a new chairperson
is elected.
   Schoenhuber led the Republicans to head-spinning fame last year,
championing xenophobic and right-wing platforms to appeal to West
Germans tired of competing with foreigners for scarce jobs and
housing.
   Beginning with West Berlin in January 1989, the Republicans
scored large gains in state and local elections and also won 7.2
percent in last June's elections for the European Parliament,
landing Schoenhuber a seat there.
   The party claimed its membership climbed from 18,000 to 26,000
the past year.
   But the wind went out of Schoenhuber's sails after the East
German revolution last fall and the sudden realization that German
reunification was no longer just a dream. With every mainstream
party embracing unification, the Republicans lost much of their
nationalist appeal.
   In recent state elections, the Republicans mustered less than 2
percent of the vote. They slipped badly in national polls _ far
below the 5 percent needed to gain seats in the federal parliament
in scheduled Dec. 2 elections.
   In recent days, Schoenhuber repeatedly cautioned that the party
was heading too far right and was becoming an extremist right-wing
group. His charges drew fire from other party leaders.
   Schoenhuber said Friday he could not take further responsibility
for the party following clashes between police and party members
during recent rallies for Oct. 14 Bavarian state parliamentary
elections. He said he himself was withdrawing as a candidate for
parliament in those elections.
   Far-right political parties in West Germany have a history of
fizzling out, unable to sustain strong membership in a nation where
the Nazi past makes the electorate especially sensitive.

   A small earthquake rattled dishes in
Hurricane, authorities said.
   No damage was reported in the tremor Friday evening measuring
2.6 on the Richter scale, said Jim Pechmann, a research assistant
professor at the University of Utah Seismograph Stations in Salt
Lake City.
   Pechmann said the earthquake likely was centered along the
Hurricane Fault running about seven miles northwest of this small
town 270 miles south of Salt Lake City near the Utah-Arizona border.
   Pechmann said he spoke by telephone with several Hurricane
residents who all reported feeling the quake. One woman told him
that the dishes in her kitchen cabinets rattled.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion and recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number in magnitude means the
ground motion is 10 times greater. An earthquake of 3.5 magnitude
can cause slight damage in the local area.

<TEXT>
   A replacement driver of a Greyhound Lines
bus that crashed was fired after the company determined the
accident was avoidable, a spokesman said.
   Spokesman George Gravley said Greyhound completed its
investigation Friday and found that driver Bobby Williamson could
have prevented the accident Thursday night that hospitalized eight
of 46 passengers.
   Four of the injured passengers were released Friday from a
hospital; the remaining four were in stable condition with cuts and
bruises, hospital officials said.
   Williamson, 50, of Chicago, had told the state highway patrol a
tractor-trailer forced the bus off Interstate 80 about two miles
east of Wamsutter on Thursday. But passengers on the bus told the
patrolman investigating the accident that Williamson was drowsy and
had been drifting between lanes.
   The cause of the accident hadn't been determined by Friday
afternoon, but Gravley said Williamson should have been able to
control the bus even if he was forced off the road.
   ``We found the accident was preventable and was caused by driver
error,'' Gravley said. ``We had two stories: One about the truck
forcing him off the road and the story that he fell asleep. In one
respect it doesn't matter.
   ``Once he went into the median, he should have been able to slow
down and avoid the accident.''
   Williamson was a replacement driver who began driving for
Greyhound when members of the Amalgamated Transit Union went on a
nationwidestrike against the bus company in March, Gravley saod.

   A 12-year-old girl abducted by her mother from a
hospital two weeks ago underwent the heart surgery that her mother
had objected to on religious grounds.
   Kimberly Winfield was in critical but stable condition after
open heart surgery Friday to correct damage she suffered from
rheumatic fever five years ago, doctors at Children's Memorial
Hospital said.
   Doctors repaired a valve in Kimberly's heart and replaced
another with an artificial valve, hospital spokeswoman Jean Benzies
said late Friday.
   Caroline Winfield, 35, abducted the girl from the hospital on
May 10. As a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mrs. Winfield is
opposed to any medical procedure that involve blood transfusion.
   Mrs. Winfield, a homeless, woman, surrendered several days later
and Kimberly was returned to the hospital. Her mother was charged
with child abduction.
   Kimberly had been a ward of the state since March, when she was
found wandering the streets with Mrs. Winfield, said Dave
Schneidman of the Illinois Department of Children and Family
Services.

<HEAD>Noriega Aide Says Castro Taped Key Prosecution Witness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former aide to Manuel Noriega says Fidel Castro
plans to turn over taped conversations with a witness in Noriega's
trial that will assist the former Panamanian strongman in his
defense.
   Maj. Felipe Camargo, an intelligence officer who held a variety
of top positions under Noriega, made the statements to The Miami
Herald from his prison cell in Gamboa, Panama, where he has been
held since the U.S. invasion.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said he had not received any
transcripts from Castro, although he said Castro provided him with
defense material during a meeting in Cuba.
   Camargo said Castro had taped conversations with Jose Blandon,
the former Noriega aide who broke with his boss in 1988 and later
testified before Congress and to a federal grand jury against
Noriega.
   Blandon was the chief witness to one important charge in the
February 1988 drug-trafficking indictment against Noriega. He said
Castro had mediated a dispute between the Colombian cocaine cartel
and Noriega after a raid on a Panamanian drug lab that the
traffickers had paid millions of dollars to protect.
   Camargo, who frequently traveled to Cuba on behalf of Noriega,
said Castro disputes the charge, and was sending transcripts to the
Miami defense attorneys to back up his claim.
   ``As a security measure, everything was taped,'' Camargo said.
``Fidel showed us that he had transcripts of various conversations
with Blandon. ... He told us they prove that the affair with the
Colombians was never discussed.''
   After Blandon went public with his charges, Castro added a
stenographer at all meetings with Panamanian officials, said
Camargo.
   The Herald said Camargo is believed to be negotiating a plea
bargain for a reduced sentence in Panama on 18 charges of brutality
against prisoners, in exchange for his testimony on behalf of
Noriega's prosecutors.
   Camargo refused to answer directly whether Castro had knowledge
of the cocaine lab raid dispute, but said another highly placed
Cuban, Manuel Pinero, head of Cuba's powerful Americas Department,
talked to him about the incident.
   ``Pinero told me, `Don't get into trouble with the Colombians:
They are very powerful people, very dangerous people,''' Camargo
said.

<HEAD>State to Appeal Ruling That Allows KKK Members to Wear Masks In
Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has struck down a law that
banned the Ku Klux Klan from wearing masks in public, saying the
group was ``persecuted'' for expressing its racist views.
   State Court Judge Howard E. Cook ruled on Friday that the 1951
law prohibiting the use of masks in public violated the First
Amendment and was unconstitutionally vague and broad.
   Assistant county solicitor David M. Fuller filed a notice of
appeal 30 minutes after Cook ruled in favor of a Klan member, who
had challenged the law by wearing the white headgear during a
one-man demonstration.
   ``It saddens me because this order, if upheld, gives protection
to some groups worthy of it, but it's going to afford the same
protection to groups not worthy of it, such as the Klan,'' Fuller
said.
   The ruling would give the Klan ``carte blanche to revert to how
it operated in the '30s and '40s,'' Fuller said.
   Cook wrote in his decision that, ``Anonymity has been permitted
(under the Constitution) when the group has been subject to
potential harm to themselves and their family members, as well as
the possibility of losing their jobs and the ability to earn a
livelihood.''
   Klansman Shade Miller Jr., 27, of Calhoun was arrested and cited
for a misdemeanor during the February demonstration. He said during
the trial he wore it because he feared for his safety and his
family's safety if his Klan affiliation were known.
   Miller's attorney, Michael Hauptman, criticized the state for
defending the ban and predicted Cook's ruling will hold up on
appeal.
   ``The statute is clearly unconstitutional. The state would be
better off in spending its resources drafting a constitutional
statute rather than defending this one,'' Hauptman said.

   A man who was caught burglarizing a
home because he stopped to play a Nintendo video game was sentenced
to eight years in prison.
   Kelly Lee Hardyman, 20, pleaded guilty Friday to two burglary
charges and was sentenced as an habitual offender. He also was
ordered by Circuit Judge Robert Cates to serve 15 years of
probation and undergo drug treatment and testing after his release.
   In January, a woman stopped by her house on her lunch hour and
encountered Hardyman playing the family's Nintendo game. He had
taken a small amount of money. Hardyman also was charged in a
similar break-in where he also had stopped to play Nintendo.
   Hardyman, who has a history of burglary convictions, has told
police he broke into houses partly because he was bored.

   A former Nazi SS guard at the Auschwitz
concentration camp was arrested for failing to disclose his Nazi
past when applying for a U.S. visa. It was the second such arrest
here in three weeks.
   Stefan Paal, 65, of Stuttgart, West Germany, was charged Friday
with one count of visa fraud. U.S. Magistrate Bert Tokairin ordered
Paal to be held pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.
   Paal arrived Thursday on vacation. A computer check by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service showed he had served at the
concentration camp in Poland during World War II, the U.S.
Attorney's Office said.
   Another suspected former Nazi SS officer, Joseph Aloysius Goertz
was arrested on visa fraud charges when he arrived in Honolulu on
May 8.
   Goertz, 76, was freed on $100,000 cash bail but was ordered to
stay in his hotel room at night and on weekends.
   Both men apparently were part of tour groups, the U.S.
Attorney's Office said.
   Under U.S. law, former concentration camp guards cannot be
issued U.S. visas under any circumstances.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Burke said Paal's passport
showed he had traveled to Thailand, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji
before his arrival on a New Zealand Airlines flight.
   Paal acknowledged performing guard duty once or twice a week in
1943-44, and admitted he did not disclose his Nazi past when he
applied for a visa, INS inspector Joseph Rogers said.

<HEAD>Pope Tells Maltese to Cling to Catholic Heritage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II crossed the Maltese
archipelago today and urged the islanders to reject any challenges
to the Roman Catholic Church's ban on abortion and other family
teachings.
   On the second day of his pilgrimage here, the first ever by a
pope to Malta, John Paul kept up his theme of reminding the Maltese
of their centuries-long Catholic traditions.
   The Vatican says 98.9 percent of Malta's 350,000 people are
Catholic. Abortion is illegal here, and courts do not grant
divorces.
   John Paul crossed from Malta to Gozo, the second largest island
in the archipelago, on a 60-foot catamaran. The trip took him by
St. Paul's Bay, where Maltese say the apostle was shipwrecked in
the year 60 and founded the first Christian community on the island.
   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said John Paul stood on the
bridge during the 18-minute trip across the blue Mediterranean
waters, nearly calm except for an occasional whitecap.
   Celebrating his first Mass on Malta at a 17th-century shrine
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, John Paul said that Maltese families
must guard against the challenge posed by rapid development.
   ``Like many societies, yours is not immune to a kind of
spiritual disorientation caused by rapid social changes and the
attraction of value systems and modes of behavior which run counter
to the deepest convictions which have molded your identity as a
people,'' John Paul said, speaking in English.
   He called on ``all those responsible for the public welfare'' to
reject as harmful to society ``everything that would ignore or deny
God's plan for the family and lessen respect for the gift of human
life,'' referring to abortion.
   About 1,000 people jammed into the small square in front of the
basilica under a scorching sun for the Mass.
   With a holiday spirit prevailing, cannons boomed a noisy salute
when word reached this town that the pope had docked in Gozo.
   Enthusiastic crowds rushed toward the white ``popemobile'' as it
drove toward the Mass site.
   The visit comes after a long period of church-state tension
under the previous Socialist government, which ruled from 1971
until narrowly losing the general election in 1987.
   The Socialist government barred private schools, including
Catholic ones, from charging tuition. It also ordered the church to
hand over property it could not prove it owned.
   New church-state accords are being worked out with the present
Nationalist administration.
   Since arriving in Malta on Friday afternoon, the pope has made
clear he expects the government to allow the church to play its
historic leading role on the islands. The visit, the pope's 48th
foreign tour, ends Sunday.

   Tens of thousands of whites
shouted their support for apartheid and white minority rule today
at a mass gathering to challenge the government's mandate to share
power with the black majority.
   ``The so-called `new South Africa' of forced integration which
the government is forcing on us gives us no other choice but to
defend our rights and our property at all levels of our
community,'' Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht told the
largest pro-apartheid rally since President F.W. de Klerk came to
power last year.
   The Conservative Party had predicted up to 100,000 whites would
attend the rally at the Voortrekker Monument, built on a hill
overlooking Pretoria to commemorate the pioneering forefathers of
the Afrikaners who constitue a majority of South Africa's 5 million
whites. Journalists estimated the crowd at between 30,000 and
50,000.
   Treurnicht has called for a petition campaign to gather 1
million signatures calling for a new white election. He says the
governing National Party would lose because white voters were
misled in last year's parliamentary voting about the extent and
speed of changes de Klerk intended to make.
   ``It is an unreasonable government which no longer represents
the nation, which practices fraudulent politics,'' Treurnicht told
the cheering crowd.
   He said the Conservative Party would try to win constitutionally
as long as such a method was possible. But he warned the
government: ``Do not force our people to stand in your path and to
challenge you to walk over us ... We are serious. There is no boat
waiting for us in the harbor.''
   The Conservatives hope the signature drive will make de Klerk
reconsider his policies, but he cannot be forced to call a new
election before 1994.
   De Klerk has freed from prison African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, legalized the African National Congress and the
Communist Party after 30 years of low-level guerrilla war, ended
segregation of beaches and hospitals, suspended executions, reduced
the influence of the military on national policy, and promised
apartheid would be gone within five years.
   Treurnicht said the Conservative Party has nothing against
people of other races who want to live in their own communities and
follow their own culture and nationalism. He told the crowd their
fight is with the Communists and the ANC, and denounced de Klerk
for freeing Mandela from his life sentence for plotting the
overthrow of the government.
   ``The ANC hates the Boer people and the white nation,''
Treurnicht said. ``They demand our land. They reject our right to
exist.'' He said Mandela ``proceeds to provoke with his threat of
violent struggle, nationalization, sanctions and a rejection of any
notion of a people or a nation in his socialist future vision.''
   De Klerk returned today from a European tour saying he had
achieved success in explaining the new direction away from
apartheid and discrimination.
   ``The new South Africa is already in the process of being born.
Nobody can stop it,'' he said. ``Not through mustering of large
meetings can anybody stop the process of the new South Africa.''
   De Klerk was greeted at Johannesburg's airport by government
officials and a multiracial police choir singing a song in Zulu and
English.
   One elderly white man stood on the edge of the 1,000-strong
airport crowd which had been bused in to greet de Klerk. The man
held up a five-foot white cross and a sign saying, ``God stands up
for the whites.''
   The Conservatives want to retain white-minority rule in most of
South Africa, contending that whites and blacks are incapable of
living together because of cultural differences. The Conservatives
favor the policy of separate homelands for black tribes and
separate neighborhoods and public facilities for different races
living in urban areas.
   The National Party began establishing the policy in law when it
came to power in 1948, but government officials now say it is
impracticable.
   Choirs sang hymns and nationalist songs to the accompaniment of
organ music and bugle fanfares. About 200 commandos wearing khaki
uniforms rode on horseback from central Pretoria to the
amphitheater on a hill overlooking the city.
   Banners on the podium said, ``The white struggle will continue''
and ``The struggle for a free state has begun.''
   People wore T-shirts saying, ``I love apartheid,'' with ``love''
represented as a big red heart.
   One sign at the back of the audience said, ``Hang Mandela.''
   Scores of uniformed members of the white supremacist Afrikaner
Resistance Movement wore guns and swastika-like symbols on their
khaki uniforms. Their leader, Eugene Terreblanche, was not invited
to address the rally.
   Ridiculing Treurnicht's call for 1 million signatures on a
petition to force an election, Terreblanche has called for whites
to assemble 1 million guns.

<HEAD>Navy Told To Conduct More Tests After `Grave Doubt' Cast on Iowa
Verdict</HEAD>

   The Navy and independent analysts will conduct
new tests over the next two weeks in the hopes of determining
exactly what caused the explosion aboard the USS Iowa that claimed
47 lives.
   Congress called for the testing _ and the Navy said it would
comply _ in light of congressional findings announced on Friday
that lawmakers said ``cast grave doubt'' on the Navy's official
conclusion that a troubled sailor probably caused the blast a year
ago.
   Officials of the General Accounting Office told members of the
Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday that the Iowa explosion
may well have been an accident.
   The Navy, in a report last September, concluded that gunner's
mate Clayton Hartwig probably set off the April 19, 1989, explosion
by inserting a chemical detonator between bags of powder.
   The lawyer representing Hartwig's family said the Navy should
pay them the same amount it spent on its first investigation: more
than $4 million.
   ``They ought to give the family at least that much to compensate
for the hell they have put them through,'' Kreig Brusnahan said
from his Cleveland office.
   ``I am more convinced than ever that we have a legitimate claim
for intentional and negligent infliction of emotion distress
against the Navy,'' Brusnahan said.
   Brusnahan expects to submit a claim to the Navy within 90 days.
The Navy will have six months to respond. If the claim is rejected,
Brusnahan said he will file with the federal courts.
   The Navy's chief of naval operations, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost,
ordered on Friday that Vice Adm. Peter Heckman take over the
renewed investigation. Heckman is director of the Navy's Sea
Systems Command, which oversees the service's naval weapons and
supervises how ships are run and built.
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who supervised the first Navy
inquiry, will not be involved in the new investigation and will
instead remain at his post as a budget director in the Navy's
planning and programing office.
   The Navy and the Sandia National Laboratories will cooperate on
the new tests, and the Navy pledged on Friday to make the findings
of their study public.
   In its report to Congress, the GAO cited tests conducted by
analysts at Sandia that indicated that the Iowa explosion may have
been caused by the ``unintentionally high-speed overramming'' of
gunpowder bags. This meant the bags might have been rammed too hard
and too far into the barrel of one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Congress sought advice from scientists at the Sandia lab in
Albuquerque, N.M., because they found fault with the Navy's initial
finding that Hartwig was ``most probably'' responsible for the
killer blast.
   The Sandia lab had conducted tests on 8-inch guns which
indicated that when an overram occurred with the gunpowder pellets
in the bags jumbled from their normal straight-across pattern _ an
occurrence that could easily happen, analysts said _ enough
friction was produced to cause an explosion.
   As for the Navy's theory that a saboteur ignited the explosion,
Sandia analysts said forms of some of the chemical constituents of
the theorized ignitor were ``either commonly used in the turrets or
are part of the maritime environment.''
   The Navy, in reopening its investigation, ordered a halt to any
firing of 16-inch guns aboard the service's four battleships.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he expected Friday's testimony ``would expose
significant shortcomings in the Navy's investigation and would cast
grave doubt on the conclusions'' and that ``I believe that the
testimony we have heard has done that and more.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, who represents Hartwig's home state,
said the Navy blamed the seaman ``because of its inability to find
other reasons. That's wrong. The rush to blame Hartwig was flat
wrong.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., added: ``The Navy's conclusion is
seriously undermined.''
   But Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
Armed Services Committee, said, ``It's far too early to jump to any
conclusions'' about a firing system that has worked tens of
thousands of times since World War II.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he would reserve judgment on
the new reports until additional investigations are completed.
   Navy officials ``did the best job they could. Now there's new
evidence, new information that warrants reopening the
investigation,'' Cheney said.

   The government offered a reward to the people
who brought a Mexican doctor to the United States to face charges
in the slaying of an American drug agent, a prosecutor acknowledged.
   A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Friday also
admitted for the first time that the government made a $20,000
payment about 10 days after Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was
captured in Mexico to face trial in the 1985 slaying of DEA agent
Enrique Camarena.
   A witness at a federal hearing in Los Angeles confirmed the
$20,000 payment and said the DEA has paid an additional $6,000 a
week in ``expenses'' since April 8 to the Mexicans who abducted the
doctor, for a total of $62,000 so far.
   Another witness, DEA supervisor Hector Berrellez, testified that
up to $50,000 was authorized for the capture of Alvarez. He said
that DEA Deputy Director Pete Gruden knew of the plan.
   The seizure of the doctor from his office in Mexico has created
a rift between the U.S. and Mexican governments. Mexico has
demanded his return, saying his delivery to the United States
violated its sovereignty.
   Alvarez, a Guadalajara gynecologist, was arrested April 3 after
being brought to El Paso, Texas, to face charges he administered
drugs to Camarena during the kidnapping, torture and murder of the
drug agent and his pilot.
   The lawyer for Alvarez argued vehemently for dismissal of the
charges against him. U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie asked for
more legal documentation before he makes a ruling.
   ``This defendant is the third defendant in this case whose
presence in this country is the result of forcible removal from his
country,'' Rafeedie said.
   He apparently was referring to Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, the
Honduran drug dealer detained by U.S. agents after being arrested
in Honduras and sent to the Dominican Republic, and Rene Martin
Verdugo Urquidez, handed over to border patrol agents through a
hole in the fence on the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fahey told Rafeedie that
capturing a witness in such a fashion was ``not frowned upon'' in
U.S. courts and that legal precedent would allow the case against
Alvarez to proceed.
   Rafeedie said he would consider whether the court has ``a
supervisory power'' to punish the government for actions even if
case law does not make the actions illegal.
   ``There comes a time when the court has to draw the line on this
type of conduct,'' the judge said.
   DEA spokesman Frank Shults in Washington denied that the
government offered a reward or bounty for the people who captured
Machain, saying the $20,000 payment was for ``services.'' He said
it could have covered such things as rental of the plane that flew
Alvarez to El Paso, Texas.
   But Fahey said: ``Clearly, the evidence is that a reward was
offered and that expenses would be reimbursed.''
   Former Mexican police officer Antonio Garate Bustamante, who is
wanted by the Mexican government, testified he paid $20,000 in DEA
money to the people who captured Alvarez, and was continuing to pay
their expenses.
   Garate said he arranged for the doctor to be brought across the
border with the approval of DEA officials. He said he found friends
who would take on the job without advance payment.
   ``I told them that no money would be provided up front, and they
would have no assistance from the DEA,'' he said. ``Whatever they
were doing they were doing on their own.''
   Testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that
Camarena was tortured and interrogated by drug lords. Prosecutors
maintain that Alvarez gave Camarena drugs to revive him for
additional torture before his slaying.
   The drug lords reportedly were incensed because Camarena's
undercover work had led U.S. and Mexican authorities to a desert
marijuana plantation, where they seized 10,000 tons of the drug
worth billions of dollars.

   Former President Reagan must cancel a trip to
Europe and limit his activities for several weeks because of
complications from cancer surgery in 1985, a spokesman said.
   But Reagan, 79, still plans to fly to San Francisco next month
to meet with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, spokesman Mark
Weinberg said Friday.
   ``Several small adhesions have developed in President Reagan's
small intestine, which his physicians believe are a result of his
abdominal surgery in 1985,'' Weinberg said.
   Adhesions often appear after abdominal surgery and are rarely
serious, said Zbigniew Petrovich, a specialist in colorectal cancer
at the University of Southern California. When a patient has
adhesions, the exterior wall of the bowels becomes attached to
another part of the bowel, Petrovich said.
   In extreme cases, he said, surgery is required when the
adhesions obstruct the bowel. ``But they are rarely that serious,''
Petrovich said.
   ``Surgery is not now contemplated. Hospitalization is not now
contemplated,'' Weinberg said.
   ``President Reagan's physicians have advised him to limit his
traveling for the next several weeks. Therefore, President and Mrs.
Reagan's trip to Europe, planned for next month, will be
postponed,'' Weinberg said.
   ``He is otherwise in excellent health,'' the spokesman said from
the Reagan office in Century City.
   Reagan was seen by a doctor on Friday, but Weinberg didn't
discuss any aspect of the visit.
   Reagan has had several intestinal surgeries in recent years.
   On July 13, 1985, doctors removed a 2-inch, cancerous polyp and
2 feet of Reagan's intestinal tract. Six months later, Reagan had
three small benign polyps removed from his intestine, and six
months after that, two small non-cancerous polyps were removed from
his colon.
   Reagan underwent prostate surgery in January 1987. Six months
later, two small benign polyps were removed from his colon.

   President Roh Tae-woo today said ``no
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory'' for Japan's brutal
colonization of Korea, but that Japan's expressions of regret are
the basis for a new relationship.
   Roh returned today from a three-day trip to Japan, during which
he invited Emperor Akihito to make the first Japanese imperial
visit to South Korea.
   The invitation came after Akihito expressed regret for the
colonization of Korea nearly half a century ago, and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu extended ``honest apologies'' for Korean
suffering in the colonial period.
   Roh, upon his arrival in Seoul, said it was time for the two
countries to put the past behind them.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity, now that Japan has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes,'' he said at an airport news conference.
   During the colonial period, Japan tried to stifle Korean culture
by banning Koreans from learning their language and forcing them to
adoptJapanese names. Tens of thousands of Koreans were killed after
being drafted for the Japanese war efforts.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and Japan in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' Roh said.
   Some Koreans said Japanese measures to clear up current sore
points were more important than apologizing for the past.
   There are unresolved disputes over discrimination against
Koreans living in Japan, aid to Koreans who remain displaced after
being forcibly removed from their homeland to perform wartime labor
for Japan, and assistance to Korean survivors of the atomic
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Roh said he had asked Japan to move forward on these issues and
expressed satisfaction with the progress made so far.
   About 20,000 police had been mobilized in Tokyo to provide
security for Roh during his three-day state visit against possible
threats from extreme leftist or rightist groups. But no incidents
were reported.
   Roh's visit to Tokyo was only the second by a South Korean head
of state since the two countries established diplomatic relations
in 1965. Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, visited Japan in 1984.
   Japan and Korea have a long history of enmity and sore points
still linger from Japan's 1910-45 colonization of the Korean
Peninsula.
   The centerpiece of Roh's visit was the Thursday night state
banquet at which Akihito expressed his ``deepest regret'' for the
suffering Koreans endured at Japanese hands. Kaifu offered his
``sincere remorse and honest apologies,'' and said good relations
between Japan and Korea are a basis for peace in the region.
   Roh extended the invitation to Akihito and Empress Michiko to
visit South Korea during a short meeting with the emperor today at
the Akasaka State Guesthouse, said a palace official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``After your coronation I am sure that you will visit many
countries, and I hope that you will consider visiting South Korea
also,'' the official quoted Roh as saying.
   Akihito, who assumed the throne after the death of his father,
Emperor Hirohito, will not travel abroad until after his official
coronation on Nov. 12. The coronation is traditionally delayed by a
year of mourning for the deceased emperor.
   Akihito would be the first emperor to visit South Korea since
its creation after Japan's defeat in World War II.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said Kaifu
had also accepted an invitation from Roh to visit South Korea at a
mutually convenient time.

<HEAD>Authorities Close Unlicensed Day Care Center With 54 Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities in this District of Columbia
suburb say they found 54 children, some in infant car seats and
some on benches, in the home of a woman running an unlicensed day
care center.
   Thirteen infants were kept in bedrooms on the first floor of the
two-story brick house, Prince Georges County authorities said
Friday. Nine of those infants were in child car seats, they said.
Older children, up to age 10, were sitting on benches in the
basement, authorities said.
   A teen-ager was watching over the children when Prince Georges
County Police and employees of the Maryland Department of Human
Resources entered the house on Thursday, authorities said.
   Despite the number of children present, the 12-room house was
described as immaculate.
   Nannie Marie Pressley, 53, was given a letter ordering her to
stop caring for the children in her home, said Ardis Welch, a
spokeswoman for the Department of Human Resources. No criminal
charges were filed, but Welch said the case had been referred to
the state's attorney's office.
   Roberta Ward of the Department of Human Resources said there was
no sign of abuse among the children seen Thursday.
   Pressley acknowledged in an interview with The Washington Post
that she had been caring for children without a license, but no
more than 20 on most days, including eight or nine infants.
   ``Yeah, I know it was wrong,'' Pressley said. ``Sometimes people
ask you, `Can I bring my baby over?' and you have to say yes.''
   Pressley said there were more children than normal in her home
Thursday because she was giving a birthday party. She said she left
her daughter in charges while she went out to buy supplies for the
party.
   It is a misdemeanor under Maryland law to operate a day care
center without a license. A violation is punishable by a fine up to
$500.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev says he will keep hundreds of
thousands of Soviet troops in eastern Germany and review his
policies on European arms control and security negotiations if a
united Germany joins NATO.
   The Soviet president's comments Friday came six days before he
discusses German unification with President Bush in Washington. It
amounted to a new Kremlin bargaining chip, a message that the West
would pay a high price for German membership in the Western
military alliance.
   Gorbachev repeated the Soviet preference that Germany belong to
both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact. The Bush administration favors only NATO membership
for a united Germany.
   Gorbachev also suggested Friday that a united Germany could
follow France's lead and take part only in NATO political
activities.
   He told a news conference that Western leaders seem to assume a
unified Germany would join NATO, but he said the German people
should be allowed to decide the issue. He said Moscow was wary of
that prospect.
   ``What should we do then about all the negotiating processes,
including the European process, the CSCE process, the Vienna
disarmament process? Then we must take a fresh look at whether we
should pursue the same policy, whether we should base it on the
same approaches,'' Gorbachev said.
   The superpowers are trying to negotiate reductions in their
nuclear and conventional forces and hope to reach agreements during
the Washington summit. CSCE refers to the 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which deals with military
security, economic cooperation and human rights.
   Soviet negotiators and State Department officials are still
trying to wrap up major unsettled issues in a new Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, or START. The aim is to expand on a declaration
already ready for Bush and Gorbachev to sign during their May
31-June 3 summit.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Gorbachev made a similar
warning to Secretary of State James A. Baker III during their talks
last week in Moscow.
   A West German newspaper today quoted Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze as saying the Soviets cannot approve NATO
membership for a united Germany. He told the paper the Soviet
position ``is determined by the realities of our foreign policy
interests, by our history and by our public opinion.''
   ``I believe that the West must understand this, and that in this
question we must be aware of our responsibility to our people,'' he
told Welt am Sonntag, which released a text of the interview before
its publication Sunday.
   Gorbachev did not threaten to withdraw from the European
negotiating processes and did not specify how the Kremlin's
positions in those talks might change. But, referring to wartime
treaties, Gorbachev indicated the estimated 380,000 Soviet troops
in eastern Germany would become squatters if the new country joins
NATO.
   ``On the basis of those international legal acts, the Soviet
Union will remain where it is now with its group of troops,'' he
said.

   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat today urged the
United States to take a tougher line against Israel in efforts to
bring about peace in the Middle East.
   ``We are running out of patience,'' Arafat told a news
conference, referring to the casualty toll in the 29-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The comments by the Palestine Liberation Organization chief came
as the United Nations Security Council was winding up a two-day
session on the escalating confrontation in the occupied territories.
   Arafat today renewed the call he made Friday to send a U.N.
emergency force into the territories to protect the Arab
population. No vote was taken on the issue, and the Security
Council meeting was to resume in New York on Tuesday.
   Arafat also called for the deployment of U.N. observers in the
area, a ban on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and
international sanctions against Israel.
   Israel opposes the deployment of a permanant U.N. force. A U.S.
official said the United States would veto any resolution that
called for either a permanent force in the occupied territories or
sanctions against Israel.
   ``There are obviously elements of the (Arafat) speech we don't
agree with,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States envoy, Thomas Pickering, did not take the
floor at the Geneva meeting.
   Israel's deputy foreign minister, Benyamin Netanyahu, said he
met U.S. representatives today and was ``encouraged'' by their
assessment of the debate. ``I found the U.S. position
understandable and reasonable,'' he told reporters, without
elaborating.
   By far the most violent attack on Israel during today's debate
came from Iran, which pledged to support the ``struggle against the
Zionist entity so as to dismantle this source of mischief,
instability and aggression.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Sheikholeslam of Iran told
reporters that the Jewish state is ``illegal'' and a ``cancerous
tumor.''
   Arab delegations called the emergency meeting of the 15-nation
Security Council to consider ways to quell a surge of Arab-Israeli
clashes in the territories and Israel. The violence followed the
killing of seven unarmed Arab workers by an Israeli gunman on
Sunday.
   Arafat challenged Israel's claim that Sunday's killings were the
act of an isolated madman, saying: ``The primary responsibility
falls on the insanity and derangement of the whole system.''
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, 710 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians, 43 Israelis slain by
Palestinians, and at least 216 other Palestinians killed by fellow
Arabs.
   Arafat said Palestinians had the ``sacred right'' to continue
their uprising until Israel ended its 23-year-old occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   Arafat today said the United States, which provides about $3
billion in aid to Israel annually, is shielding the Jewish state
from international pressure.
   He also criticized Washington for restricting the immigration of
Soviet Jews to the United States. He said this forced the
``transfer'' of Soviet Jews to Israel instead.
   ``Does the American citizen accept that in 30 months, 256
Palestinian children have died? In relation to the U.S. population
this is the equivalent of 140,000 American children,'' he said.
   Netanyahu told journalists that casualty figures given by Arafat
were at least double the real toll.
   In Washington on Friday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
stated U.S. opposition to stationing a U.N. observer force in the
territories but said the ``idea of the secretary-general sending
one of his top aides to take a look at the situation and return is
something quite different.''
   Asked to appraise Arafat's speech, Baker said he had not read it.

   The Vatican ambassador today announced
that Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun and militia chieftain Samir
Geagea have agreed to a permanant truce, but their forces continued
to fight.
   Police said Aoun's troops and Geagea's Lebanese Forces
militiamen exchanged sniper fire in east Beirut, killing three
people and wounding one.
   The latest fighting raised the casualty toll to 1,035 killed and
2,770 wounded since the power struggle between the rival warlords
broke out Jan. 30.
   There was no immediate comment from Geagea or Aoun on the
declaration of the envoy, Pablo Puente. Many previous cease-fires
have failed to last.
   Puente said at a news conference that in addition to making
permanant their 9-day-old truce, the two leaders had agreed to halt
propaganda campaigns against each other and to release all
prisoners.
   Also today, the Syrian army intervened to end 15 hours of street
battles between rival Shiite Moslem militias that killed five
people and wounded 42.
   In another development, Israeli-backed militiamen killed four
Arab guerrillas during a clash today in south Lebanon, the Israeli
army command and the guerrillas said. The Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine said its fighters attacked to avenge the
slayings Sunday of seven Palestinian laborers by an Israeli. The
slayings near Tel Aviv caused riots in the occupied lands.
   Syrian troops armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers moved into the south Beirut slum quarters of
Hajjaj and Haymadi before dawn to stop the fighting there.
   The capital's Moslem sectors remained tense, with fighters of
the fundamentalist pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the
mainstream Syrian-backed Amal movement still on a combat footing.
   The factions have been battling for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest sect, for 2{ years. By
police count at least 1,049 people have been killed and 3,136
wounded in that intermittent feud.
   Most of the 16 Westerners missing in Lebanon are believed held
in the south Beirut slums close to the fortified Green Line that
slices the capital into Christian and Moslem sectors. The hostages
include six Americans.
   Streets were littered with the burned-out, blackened hulks of
dozens of cars set ablaze by rocket-propelled grenades in the
fighting.
   Hundreds of Moslem families used the lull to evacuate the
shantytown slums and head for the relative safety of villages in
predominantly Shiite south Lebanon, where Hezbollah and Amal
frequently clash.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. It has 40,000 troops
in the country, mainly in Moslem areas, under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   In the clash in south Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said
the guerrillas ambushed a South Lebanon Army convoy near the town
of Shebaa in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied border zone.
   Israel established the 6-to-10-mile-deep zone to curb guerrilla
raids into northern Galilee when it withdrew the bulk of its army
from south Lebanon in mid-1985, three years after it invaded.
   The Israeli military also reported four guerrillas killed, and
said members of the South Lebanon Army, which is trained and
supplied by Israel, suffered no casualties. An army spokesman said
the attackers were members of George Habash's Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   The Popular Front, in a series of communiques issued in Beirut,
acknowledged four of its fighters had died and said the attack was
to avenge the massacre of seven Palestinian workers near Tel Aviv
on Sunday.
   The Front is made up of Palestinian and leftist groups which
regularly attack the Israelis and their militia allies in south
Lebanon.
   Lebanese security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the guerrillas detonated three remote-control bombs on a road
as the convoy passed.
   It was the heaviest guerrilla raid in the heavily guarded buffer
zone in several weeks.

   A $7 million production of Giuseppe
Verdi's opera ``Aida'' at Giants Stadium has been canceled because
of problems in setting up the show, a stadium official said this
morning.
   Producers of the show decided to cancel late Friday ``because of
their inability to complete some necessary logistical arrangements
for the show,'' said John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey
Sports and Exposition Authority. The authority operates the stadium.
   The show was scheduled for performances June 1 and 2.
   Ken Cherry, a supervisor at Ticketmaster in New York City, said
ticket sales had been brisk.
   ``It was selling out,'' he said. ``There were quite a few
tickets sold.''
   No one answered the telephone this morning at the offices of the
Montreal-based producers, International Opera Festival.
   The opera extravaganza was to feature a cast of more than a
thousand and a five-story replica of a sphinx.
   The show was first performed in Giza, Egypt, in 1987. Since
then, the production has been staged around the world and seen by
about 850,000 people.
   Tickets ranged in price from $35 to $300; Cherry said refunds
would be available.

   Populist Boris N. Yeltsin today failed to win a
runoff election for the presidency of the Soviet Union's largest
republic, and the Russian Congress now must take new nominations.
   Yeltsin is considered one of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's main rivals,
and his failure to win the runoff was a major victory for the
Soviet leader.
   Yeltsin won 503 votes, 28 short of the necessary majority of the
1,060-member congress. His rival, Communist Party functionary Ivan
Polozkov, received 497 votes.
   Lawmakers said Yeltsin, 59, may run again, or that a compromise
candidate with better chances of winning a majority may be
nominated. The legislators will resume their session on Monday.
   In Friday's first round of voting by the Russian Congress,
Yeltsin won 497 votes, short of the 531 he needed for an absolute
majority.
   The candidate backed by Gorbachev, Russian premier Alexander
Vlasov, withdrew from the race Friday after it became clear he
lacked Yeltsin's popularity.
   During his campaign, Yeltsin angered Gorbachev with calls for
sovereignty for the Russian republic, which includes Moscow, the
seat of national leadership. Russia, by far the largest of the
nation's 15 republics, contains more than two-thirds of the
country's territory and half the Soviet populace.
   Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of being anti-socialist and said his
plans for Russian autonomy would mean ``the breakup of the Soviet
Union.''
   Yeltsin pledged Friday that if elected he would defend the
republic from Kremlin interference, but also said he would be able
to work with Gorbachev.
   Yeltsin told the Russian Congress of his plans to promote
Russian sovereignty, establish a market economy, increase housing
and fill stores with consumer goods.
   He blasted the national government program announced Thursday
for a transition to a free-market economy. Yeltsin said he backed
an alternative program involving sale of government property, full
independence for enterprises, more liberal laws on ownership and
foreign loans.
   Yeltsin is already a member of the national Congress of People's
Deputies and a member of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   Yeltsin, once a Gorbachev protege, has made a remarkable
political comeback from disgrace two years ago, when he was ousted
from his post as Moscow party chief and ostracized by the Kremlin
elite, including Gorbachev. Yeltsin has continued to criticize
Gorbachev for what he calls ``halfway reforms.''
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov appealed to consumers Friday
to stop their panic buying of food, triggered by his announcement
of plans for sharp price increases, and urged lawmakers to quickly
approve economic reforms.
   Opposition deputies in parliament demanded a no-confidence vote
aimed at bringing down Ryzhkov's government, but he got one
important voice of support for his program: from Gorbachev himself.
   ``I'm hoping in the end, after all the debates _ and they won't
be simple _ we'll agree that we have to move toward a market. I'm
sure of this,'' Gorbachev told a news conference.
   Ryzhkov's plan, broadcast on national television Thursday,
proposes tripling the price of bread and other flour-based products
on July and increasing the prices of most other consumer goods in
January.
   It envisions a five-year gradual shift to a government-regulated
market economy by freeing most prices, raising taxes, selling off
state property, and reducing central control of industry.
   Announcement of the plan triggered immediate rushes to stores
for macaroni and bread, Ryzhkov told reporters at the Kremlin.
``Now this wave for bread and bread products has already rolled
through half the country, and it's gotten to Moscow,'' he said.
   ``I am appealing for restraint and calm,'' said Ryzhkov, looking
haggard and with his voice ragged from fatigue.
   At Food Shop Number One on Gorky Street, a shop assistant, who
asked not to be identified, said panic-stricken buyers ``are
literally clearing full shelves for hoarding.''
   Bread is the staple of the Soviet diet, virtually the only
product that's always readily available and remains cheap at about
32 cents a loaf.

   A moderate earthquake shook the
Portuguese capital for a few seconds Saturday but caused no damage
or injuries, authorities said.
   The quake, which registered 4.0 on the Richter scale, was
centered 90 miles west of Lisbon in the Atlantic Ocean, according
to Lisbon's National Institute for Meteorology and Geophysics.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5. A quake registering 4 can cause moderate
damage in a populated area.
   Much of Lisbon was destroyed by a powerful earthquake and an
ensuing tidal wave and fire in 1755. The city center was rebuilt
and has since suffered several less serious quakes.

   A small earthquake shook central
West Germany on Saturday, sending worried residents rushing into
the streets but causing no damage or injuries, authorities said.
   The temblor, which shook buildings for up to 10 seconds,
registered between 3.5 and 3.6 on the Richter scale of ground
motion, said Professor Ludwig Ahorner at the Cologne University
seismograph station.
   The epicenter was probably in the Rhein-Main area, near
Frankfurt, he said.
   Officials said police and fire stations were inundated with
telephone calls from people who reported dishes rattling and floors
shaking. The quake struck at 1:45 p.m., when stores were crowded
with shoppers.
   Some anxious customers rushed out of stores onto the streets,
police said.

<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents are investigating possible
links between a car-bomb blast that injured two radical
environmentalists accused of carrying the explosives and a recent
bombing at a lumber mill.
   Earth First! activists Darryl Cherney and Judi Bari, who have
been waging a campaign to slow logging in Northern California's
old-growth forests, strongly denied knowing anything about the pipe
bomb that injured them Thursday.
   Some of their supporters accused police of framing the victims,
and about 200 environment activists held a vigil at police
headquarters Friday night.
   The two were put under arrest Friday after police questioned
Cherney for several hours.
   Bari, 40, was under police guard at a hospital where she was in
stable condition after surgery for a fractured pelvis, officials
said. Cherney, 33, was treated for minor injuries and booked into
city jail.
   Oakland Municipal Court Judge Horace Wheatley raised bail to
$100,000 each, based on what he called new information from Oakland
police. He declined to elaborate.
   No charges were immediately filed, but police Lt. Mike Sims said
at a news conference, ``The evidence is strong they were
transporting this device and that's why they were arrested.''
   ``We believe it went off accidentally,'' Sims said. ``Based on
our determination of the placement of the device in the car, we
believe they should have known it was there.''
   Sims declined to be specific about what evidence was found. But
The Tribune of Oakland quoted unidentified law enforcement sources
today as saying that the bomb, which was located behind the
driver's seat, was covered by Bari's guitar case.
   She placed the case there when she got into the vehicle, the
sources said, suggesting that she knew the device was in the car.
   Finishing nails identical to ones used in the bomb were found
elsewhere in the car, and similar nails were found during a search
of one of the suspect's home, the sources said. Duct tape and wire
resembling that used in the bomb was found in Cherney's van and
home and also in Bari's house, they said.
   Duke Diedrich, spokesman for the FBI in San Francisco, said the
bureau planned to send remnants of the pipe bomb to its
headquarters for analysis and comparison to remains of a pipe bomb
that exploded May 10 outside a lumber mill in Cloverdale, about 80
miles north of San Francisco. That blast caused no injuries and
only minor damage.
   The FBI is also investigating possible links between Friday's
explosion and sabotage of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric transmission lines
in Santa Cruz County last month that left thousands of residents
without power throughout the county.
   ``We will conduct and have been conducting an investigation
throughout Northern California to see if any of the incidents are
connected in any way,'' Diedrich said. ``This is going to be a
long, involved investigation.''
   The bomb in Bari's car exploded on an Oakland street as she and
Cherney were driving to a rally in Santa Cruz. The blast blew out
the windows and the left rear door, bowed the roof upward and blew
open other doors.
   Bari and Cherney insisted they are victims, not criminals.
   ``We are demanding ... that the Oakland police department and
the FBI seek out this assassin and bring whoever it is to justice
immediately,'' Cherney said in an interview from his jail cell.
   Susan Jordan, an attorney for Bari, said her client blamed the
explosion on the timber industry. ``We're not involved in any
violence,'' Jordan quoted Bari as saying.
   The pair were described by friends as dedicated pacifists,
instrumental in planning non-violent efforts to halt what they
believe is excessive logging of ancient redwood trees in Northern
California.
   Though Earth First! has become known for radical tactics,
including driving spikes into trees to damage logging equipment,
the group recently announced it was ending the practice.
   Sims said authorities had used three search warrants to find
evidence that led to the arrests. Police Thursday night searched
Cherney's van and a Berkeley house occupied by several members of
another environmentalist group, Seeds of Peace. On Friday the
searched Bari's home near Ukiah.
   Cherney said he agreed to let police search the van because he
feared for his life. Daniel Barron, an Earth First! organizer from
San Francisco, said about a dozen anti-logging activists have
received anonymous death threats.
   The arrests prompted Earth First! supporters to criticize police
for ``blaming the victim.'' They vowed to continue a 24-hour vigil
at Oakland police headquarters until the activists are released.
   ``I know they didn't blow themselves up,'' said Shannon Marr, a
friend who was in a car ahead of Bari's vehicle.

<HEAD>Genscher Stresses Transatlantic Partnership to Graduates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher today called for a ``new transatlantic partnership,''
bolstered by a treaty, with the United States and Canada to
accompany a more unified Europe in 1992.
   ``The Atlantic must not grow wider as a result of European
unification,'' Genscher told graduates of Georgetown University's
School of Foreign Service. Genscher received an honorary doctorate
from the university.
   European unity has raised concerns in this country about the
ability of U.S. business to compete with a ``Fortress Europe''
whose internal trade barriers are lowered.
   The 12-nation European Community plans to create a vast common
market by the end of 1992. Leaders are also working on a blueprint
for political unity.
   ``The European Community is becoming a pillar in the
transatlantic structure as a result of its progress towards
European union and of economic monetary and political union,''
Genscher said. ``We must establish a framework for consultation and
action for the new transatlantic partnership.
   ``Other important European institutions, such as the European
Parliament and the Council of Europe, should also seek new forms of
dialogue and cooperation with our American partners. I call for a
solemn joint declaration on this new transatlantic partnership.''
   The European Parliament is the representative body for the
European Community. The Council of Europe is a separate
representative body.
   ``This declaration must embrace the political, economic,
ecological, technological and cultural aspects of relations linking
the United States and Canada with the European Community. This must
be followed by a European-American treaty aimed at shaping the
future. Both of these must also play a part in overcoming the
division of Europe. They must contribute to the formation of the
one Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals and pave the way for
cooperation between North America and the new democracies in
Europe.''
   The EC comprises the European Economic Community, known as the
Common Market, the European Atomic Energy Commission and the
European Coal and Steel Community. Its members are Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

<HEAD>Incumbents Enjoy Overwhelming Edge in PAC Receipts</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-PAC Money-Spending, AM-PAC Money-Donations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

   Political action committees gave $63.5 million
to congressional candidates in the first 15 months of the 1990
election cycle, targeting nearly 90 percent of the special-interest
money to incumbents.
   The 4,517 PACs registered with the Federal Election Commission
began April with another $131 million on hand for the final six
months of the election year, the FEC said in a study released
Saturday.
   The $63.5 million in candidate contributions by PACs from
January 1989 through March 1990 represented a 13 percent increase
over the comparable period in the 1987-88 election cycle.
   Most of the increase came in spending on House races and was
partly attributable to the 10 special House elections held to fill
vacancies over the past year.
   All told, PACs raised $219 million and spent $173 million in the
15 months covered by the study. Fund raising was up 2 percent over
the last cycle, and spending increased 7 percent.
   Total spending was nearly three times the amount actually
donated to congressional candidates. Total spending includes
administrative, staff and new fund-raising costs and in some cases
transfers from the national PACs to affiliated state PACs for use
in state elections.
   The study's release comes as the Senate considers
campaign-finance legislation containing new limits on PAC activity
designed to erode some of the fund-raising edge typically enjoyed
by incumbents.
   The FEC data show PACs not only are spending more on
congressional races but incumbents are getting even larger shares
of the money.
   In the 15 months studied, incumbents got $56.4 million from
PACs, or 89 percent of PAC candidate donations. Challengers
received $3.2 million, or just 5 percent. The rest went to
candidates in races without incumbents.
   In the same 15-month period of the 1987-88 cycle, incumbents got
88 percent of PAC donations to candidates and challengers received
6.5 percent. Two years earlier, the edge was 85 percent to 7
percent in favor of incumbents.
   ``What this shows is that we need public financing of
elections,'' said Joan Claybrook, the head of the public-interest
lobby Public Citizen. ``PAC contributions from special interests
which want legislation enacted should not determine who gets
elected to Congress.''
   Democrats, largely because of their majorities in both chambers
of Congress, received more PAC money.
   This year's Democratic Senate candidates received $10.3 million
from PACs through the end of March, with $9.5 million of that total
going to incumbent senators facing re-election. GOP Senate
candidates got $9.5 million from PACs over the same period, of
which $7 million went to incumbents.
   In House races, PACs gave $30.1 million to Democratic
candidates, $28 million of it to incumbents. Republican candidates
received $13.3 million, with all but $240,000 going to incumbents.
   The PACs also reported contributing $10.3 million to national,
state and local political party organizations.
   Twenty-nine PACs reported raising at least $1 million over the
15 months, and nine of them raised at least $2 million.
Twenty-three PACs spent more than $1 million in the study period;
three topped $2 million.
   Topping the fund-raising list was the Teamsters union PAC, which
reported raising $6.7 million in the 15-month period. The Teamsters
PAC also was first in spending, at $4.6 million, and in the $4.9
million it had on hand as of March 31.
   Another labor PAC, that of the Letter Carriers union, narrowly
eclipsed the Teamsters in donations to candidates, with
contributions totaling $884,600 in the study period, $2,000 more
than the Teamsters' group.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's PAC was the leading corporate
PAC, with $1.8 million in receipts; disbursements, $1.7 million;
and contributions to candidates, $829,000.
   Leading the trade- and health-organization PACs in fund raising
and overall spending was the American Medical Association PAC,
which collected $4.1 million in the 15-month period and spent $2.1
million.
   But in that same category, the Realtors PAC gave the most to
candidates, reporting $789,000 in contributions compared with the
AMA PAC's $542,037.
   The Realtors group was second to the AMA in fund raising in this
category, collecting $3.2 million in the 15-month period.

<HEAD>Race for Democratic Nomination a Free-for-All</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The three-way fight for Iowa's
Democratic gubernatorial nomination began as a battle over abortion
but has ranged far afield in a free-for-all that has Iowans
wondering what comes next.
   The heat got so intense at one point that state party Chairman
John Roehrick told two contenders to ``cool it'' and ``keep their
eyes on the prize'' _ two-term Republican Gov. Terry Branstad.
   With the June 5 primary just around the corner, the Democratic
race remains too close to call.
   The fight is between state House Speaker Don Avenson, state
Attorney General Tom Miller and former banker John Chrystal, all
hoping to oppose Branstad in November.
   Some argue the pressure is higher because the state features the
first-in-the-nation precinct caucuses. That brings more attention
to the state even in non-presidential years, Avenson said.
   ``The significance of Iowa goes beyond our small population,''
he said. ``We're the first-in-the-nation caucus state, we're the
state that many people in this country listen to for direction in
terms of Democratic politics.''
   Because of that, activists on the abortion issue have gotten
involved. Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, said the group would target Miller and Branstad,
both of whom are pro-life, for defeat.
   Michelman previewed television ads the group had prepared, and
said she planned a $250,000 campaign. That was derailed, however,
when only one television station in the state would carry the
commercials.
   NARAL's Iowa affiliate endorsed Avenson, angering Chrystal, who
pointed to his 25 years of financial support for Planned Parenthood
and abortion rights. But Avenson also snared endorsements from
other feminist groups, including the National Organization for
Women.
   The groups believe Avenson has the best chance of beating
Miller, and they don't want to split the pro-choice vote.
   ``Iowa Democrats won't let these would-be kingmakers tell them
how to vote,'' snapped Chrystal.
   ``You have to wonder why Don Avenson would accept support from a
group that is narrow, negative and not interested in the future of
Iowa,'' Miller echoed.
   The campaign has featured twists on other issues as well.
   Avenson is a large man who concedes he's as much as 40 pounds
overweight. In 1985 he suffered a heart attack, and he was
hospitalized for two days last week for emergency procedures to
clear a blocked artery in his heart.
   Some activists believe voters will be nervous about Avenson's
health, but others look for a sympathy vote.
   Avenson said his quick recovery demonstrates his general good
health.
   ``It makes Miller and Chrystal understand they're dealing with
steel wrap and rawhide here, not just a normal person,'' said
Avenson, who took time out to admonish reporters on their smoking
habits and weight.
   For his part, Miller has sought to deflect attention from
abortion by stressing tough anti-crime stands. Television ads brag
he's ``convicted 135 murderers'' and underscore his proposal to
halve the blood-alcohol level needed for a drunken driving
conviction.
   Avenson charges that would make criminals out of people who
drink two cans of beer and says it's ``insane.'' Miller accused
Avenson of being ``on the side of the drunk driver.''
   That's when Roehrick told the candidates to keep their eyes on
Branstad.
   Many label Chrystal a dark horse, but he's well connected and
has raised far more money than the other Democrats. He has reported
raising $524,000 to Miller's $339,000 and Avenson's $294,000.
   Branstad dwarfs them all with $2.4 million.
   Chrystal also will get attention in the closing days of the
campaign courtesy of the summit between President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Chrystal, an acquaintance of Gorbachev, has been invited to
Washington during the May 31-June 3 summit and will lead a
delegation of farm experts to Minneapolis to meet with Soviet
officials when Gorbachev stops there.
   That comes just before the June 5 primary.
   Complicating the issue is a big block of undecided voters,
ranging as high as 40 percent in some surveys.
   Avenson said that's because Iowa voters are sophisticated after
having been exposed to presidential contenders for 20 years.
   ``Iowans make their decisions very, very late,'' said Avenson.

<HEAD>National Gallery Opens Show of Edvard Munch's Troubling Prints</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tormented inner life of Norwegian artist
Edvard Munch, who once said that ``my pictures are my diaries,'' is
laid bare in a new exhibition of his prints opening Sunday at the
National Gallery of Art.
   The show's 94 prints were assembled from the holdings of Sarah
and Lionel Epstein of Washington, D.C., who plan eventually to give
their entire collection of about 200 Munch woodcuts, lithographs
and other graphic works to the National Gallery.
   Gallery officials say the Epsteins, who began collecting his
prints in 1961, have the largest and finest collection of Munch's
graphic works outside Europe.
   To mark the show's opening, the Epsteins gave the gallery two of
the prints on display. They are ``The Kiss,'' a color woodcut made
in 1902, and ``Madonna,'' a color woodcut combined with lithograph
made in the same year which presents an ambiguous image of
religious or sexual ecstasy.
   The prints reveal the turbulent feelings of anger, jealousy,
loneliness, anxiety, fear and sexual desire that haunted Munch for
much of his life. His recurring artistic themes, such as sick
children and estranged couples, reflected his own romantic
conflicts and the traumatic deaths of his parents and siblings.
   Senior curator Andrew Robison said Munch, like his contemporary
Sigmund Freud, ``portrays the life of his inner self, his emotions
and dreams.''
   Munch's approach to life through his art and innovative print
techniques was highly influential among German expressionists.
Gallery director J. Carter Brown called Munch, who died in 1944,
``one of the great talents of modern Western civilization.''
   The exhibition, titled ``Edvard Munch: Master Prints from the
Epstein Family Collection,'' will appear at the National Gallery
through Sept. 3.
   It will travel to Honolulu, Los Angeles, Miami, Indianapolis,
Kansas City, Mo., Atlanta and Memphis, Tenn., through January 1992.
   The exhibition is underwritten by Statoil, the Norwegian
national oil company.

<TEXT>
   On a siding near an interstate highway,
the old cabooses sit out of service, but they're far from the end
of their line.
   Already, many of these railroad relics have been cleaned,
painted and moved across the country to serve as quilt shops, ice
cream parlors, storage buildings and motel rooms.
   ``The railroads don't make them anymore,'' says Don Flynn, a
Danville businessman who has just five of his original 26-caboose
fleet left at the siding visible from Interstate 74.
   Flynn, who operates Prairie States Warehouse, has the cabooses
lined up outside his business with a telephone number and ``For
Sale'' sign displayed for passing motorists.
   The collection caught the eye of James Friedlander of Freeport,
Maine.
   ``Last year, in the dead of winter, we were driving by Prairie
States and saw four or five cabooses parked on the tracks along the
interstate,'' Friedlander said. ``They gave us the keys and said to
pick the one we wanted.''
   Friedlander selected his favorite, paid Flynn $3,500 for it, and
shipped it to Freeport for an additional $2,000. A crane lifted the
caboose from the track and took it to Friedlander's 15-room
bed-and-breakfast home.
   He and his wife planned to use the caboose for another sleeping
room.
   ``Instead, we use it for an office and for storage,'' said
Friedlander.
   Flynn acquired the 26 cabooses in 1982 after the death of the
Danville businessman who owned them.
   ``We had the tracks out here and so we just brought the cabooses
he owned out here and tried to sell them,'' said Flynn.
   The first 14 went for $2,500 each. The price has risen to $4,500.
   Each caboose is 40 feet long, 13 feet wide and 16 feet high, and
weighs 30 tons. They have toilets and heating stoves that were used
by the railroad crewmen who once rode in them.
   Railroads have been phasing out cabooses, which once were the
last cars on freight trains.
   Flynn said that when the last five cabooses are gone he probably
will have no more to sell. ``They're getting harder and harder to
come by,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Here are some facts and figures about Burma's national election,
to be held Sunday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   AT STAKE _ The first multiparty elections in Burma since 1960
are for 492 seats in a parliament that will draft a new
constitution. Once this is done, the ruling military has promised
to step down from power.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VOTING _ There are nearly 21 million eligible voters, including
2.6 million in Rangoon, the capital. All citizens 18 years old and
above can vote. A complete election tally will not be available for
up to three weeks.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SUPERVISION _ Some groups have charged the election will be
rigged; the military maintains it will be fair and free. An
election commission says ballots will be counted at each of the
18,190 polling stations with candidates' representatives present.
   Foreign monitoring will be minimal. Several human rights and
legal groups asked to observe the election but have not received
visas. Rangoon has allowed more than 60 American, Asian and
European journalists into the country, which has been virtually
off-limits to the foreign press since mid-1989.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MAIN PARTIES AND CANDIDATES _ Contesting the election are 2,296
candidates from 93 parties along with 87 independents.
   The National Unity Party, fielding 490 candidates, is widely
believed to have military backing. The best organized and financed,
it is the least popular: under the name of the Burma Socialist
Program Party it led Burma to economic ruin during a
quarter-century of one-party rule.
   The National League for Democracy, fielding 448 candidates, is
the strongest of the pro-democracy parties, although its two key
leaders _ Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo _ have been barred from
participating in the elections.
   Other parties which stand to make a showing are the League for
Democracy and Peace, backed by onetime Prime Minister Nu; the Union
Nationals Democracy Party of Aung Gyi; Thu Wai's Democracy Party
and the Democratic Front for National Reconstruction headed by
onetime leftist leader Chit Maung.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ISSUES _ Pro-democracy parties are hoping to return to a liberal
multiparty government, abolished by the military in 1962. The
National Unity Party stands for conservatism and the status quo.
   Parties have been vague on specific political and economic
issues. Criticism of the military was forbidden during campaigning
and discussion of other topics was restricted as well.

   The crew of a Chinese tanker whose hull
cracked in a storm gave up a three-day struggle to save the leaking
vessel on Saturday and was rescued by another ship in the Indian
Ocean.
   The Australian Federal Sea Safety Center reported all 38 crewmen
aboard the Tao Yuan Hai had been transferred to the Japanese gas
tanker Kakuko Maru.
   The Tao Yuan Hai first reported it was in trouble on Wednesday
after its hull cracked in rough weather 2,000 miles southwest of
Perth.
   The ship headed north in search of calmer waters but continued
taking on water in conditions Australian authorities described as
atrocious.
   The 122,000-ton ship was hauling a load of iron ore from
Venezuela to Wollongong, 50 miles south of Sydney.
   A salvage tug, the Smit Rotterdam, was steaming toward the Tao
Yuan Hai and was expected to reach the ship on Tuesday, the Sea
Safety Center said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels in El Salvador have flagrantly
violated international law by executing hundreds of civilians over
the years without proper judicial procedures, a human rights group
said Saturday.
   Americas Watch, a privately funded group based in New York, said
in a report the FMLN rebels should immediately halt trials of
suspected war criminals until the insurgents can prove the
proceedings comply with international standards.
   It also called on the insurgents to renounce the use of the
death penalty to punish offenses related to the civil war.
   The report said the rebels are bound by the terms of Geneva
Convention rules which provide for the protection of victims of
civil conflicts.
   Specifically, the study accused the insurgents in some instances
of carrying out assassination-style executions of government
officials, members of civil defense groups and others said to be
government informers or collaborators.
   They cited El Salvador's attorney general, Roberto Garcia
Alvarado, as being the victim of an ``extrajudicial slaying'' a
year ago.
   In other instances, the report said the victims were given the
death penalty after being subjected to a flawed judicial
proceedings in areas controlled by the rebels.
   The Salvadoran military has been widely accused of promoting or
engaging in extrajudicial slayings over the years, and Americas
Watch has highlighted these abuses in previous reports.
   But the report released Saturday, titled ``Violations of Fair
Trial Guarantees by the FMLN's Ad Hoc Courts,'' focuses on rebel
excesses.
   In response, FMLN spokesmen said death sentences for enemy
collaborators normally are preceded by an investigation whose
results are judged by an impartial civilian tribunal.
   The rebel spokesmen cited by Americas Watch acknowledged that
conditions for a fair trial are not always ideal in
rebel-controlled territory. In some zones, the spokesmen have
noted, there is not a single person who qualifies as a defense
attorney.
   But Americas Watch rejected the FMLN arguments, asserting that
the rebels have given the authority to impose the death penalty to
persons with no legal training. It called this practice
``appallingly indecent.''
   The report also denounced as a ``serious flaw'' the FMLN
decision to withhold the identities of the members of its courts.
The insurgents have said confidentiality is necessary to protect
these persons from reprisals.
   As for the rebel practice of selecting the counsel for the
accused, the report said, ``This makes a farce of any defense the
rebels assert is provided to the accused.''
   The FMLN has in public statements said it is attempting to
ensure compliance with the Geneva Convention in its judicial
proceedings.
   Rebel spokesmen also have acknowledged that the FMLN is
``normally severe'' with those who are discovered to be engaging in
spy activities for the government.
   ``It finds itself forced to be so because the government forces,
with the support of American advisors, have increased their efforts
to create intelligence networks which ... are aimed at discovering
where the strategic command posts of the FMLN are in order to
annihilate them,'' the FMLN has said.
   The conflict between the rebels and the U.S.-backed Salvadoran
government is believed to have claimed more than 70,000 lives since
it began more than 10 years ago.

   Squatters protesting a court order
evicting them from an office building hurled bricks at police, set

streets on Saturday.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd and arrested seven
squatters, but the rest withdrew into their heavily barricaded
building in the northern city. Police surrounded the building,
television said.
   No injuries were reported in the early morning clash, and it was
not immediately clear how many police and squatters were involved.
   The squatters, who have been ordered to leave the
Wolters-Noordhof office complex by Monday, tossed the furniture of
the bar and lawyer's office into the street before setting them
ablaze, the television report said.

   Investigators picked up the pieces of an Air
Force jet and tried to determine why the plane crashed, plowing a
fiery path through a residential neighborhood. The pilot and a
woman on the ground were killed.
   The F16-A, on an approved training route, had just flown low
over a public school with more than 1,000 students when it went
down Friday morning in rural south Georgia, witnesses said.
   It was the second time since November that a military jet
crashed in Georgia and killed civilians on the ground.
   ``My first thought was, `They're bombing us,''' said Vance Taft,
whose farm abuts the crash site two miles north of Pearson.
   Taft and his wife, Lucy, watched in horror as the plane
destroyed two houses and continued across a highway, shearing a
pine tree in half, turning sideways and shattering to pieces.
   Killed in the crash were the pilot and a woman identified by the
Atkinson County Sheriff's Department as Marian Lanier, in her
mid-50s, who worked each Friday as a housekeeper in one of the
leveled homes.
   Air Force officials today identified the pilot as Maj. Archie E.
Stuart, 39, of New Castle, Pa. An 18-year Air Force veteran, Stuart
was chief of operations plans for the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing.
He was assigned to Moody in October 1988.
   The F-16A ``Fighting Falcon'' was on a training flight from
Moody Air Force Base, about 40 miles away near Valdosta, to Lake
George Weapons Range in Florida when it crashed, Moody officials
said. The pilot was the only person on board, they said.
   A 50-member team from Moody searched the woods near the damaged
houses, putting remains of the plane into black plastic bags. An
Air Force board was formed to investigate the crash.
   The board's interim president, Col. Stu Mosbey, estimated it
would take 30 days to determine the cause of the crash.
   The plane, which General Dynamics Corp. said cost about $9
million, was carrying 20mm practice bullets _ including some that
apparently caught fire after the crash _ six practice bombs and a
practice unarmed Sidewinder missile, Mosbey said. He said all the
items were recovered within the crash area.
   The jet was in a ``two-ship formation'' with another F-16A when
it went down, said Air Force Master Sgt. Pat Miller.
   Mosbey said jets from the base routinely make low-level training
flights at altitudes of no more than 500 feet.
   The training route used by the two pilots Friday is approved by
the Federal Aviation Administration, a Moody spokesman said.
   The jets had just passed over a public school when the one went
down.
   ``We see the planes flying low over the school all of the time,
but these two were flying lower than usual,'' said Michele
McKinnon, a teacher at the county's elementary and high school
complex, where more than 1,000 students were startled by the
explosion.
   ``We ran around to the front of the school and we could see the
smoke coming from where the plane crashed,'' she said.
   The plane itself did not burn, but flames from a fuel tank that
tore away from the jet and exploded quickly engulfed the
single-story house where Mrs. Lanier was working, City Fire Chief
Henry Vickers said.
   The house and a mobile home behind it were destroyed, and at
least seven other homes were damaged by debris, authorities said.
   In November, a Navy jet crashed into an apartment complex north
of Atlanta and burst into flames, killing two residents of the
complex and seriously wounding the pilot. The fighter was trying to
land at Dobbins Air Force Base when it crashed in suburban Smyrna.

   A man who admitted molesting and killing
12 children over a four-year period and hiding some of the bodies
in abandoned wells has been convicted of murder and sentenced to
hang.
   The man's arrest in December and his conviction Thursday ended a
traumatic time for the nation, where the string of child killings
was unprecedented.
   The victims, nine boys and three girls, were between 9 and 13
years old. Many of the victims' parents demanded a public hanging.
   The killer, 45-year-old Naceur Ben Allala Damergi, admitted the
crimes and showed investigators where the victims' bodies were
hidden, mostly in pastures and unused wells.
   No death sentence has been carried out in Tunisia for two years.

   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi flew to the

Kuwait News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said Gadhafi immediately went

   Quoting unnamed sources, it reported that Gadhafi was trying to
persuade Assad to attend the Arab summit scheduled to start Monday
in Baghdad, Iraq.
   Assad, a bitter foe of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, has
refused to attend the summit called to deal with the influx of
Soviet Jews into Israel and occupied Arab territories. The summit
also was to address an alleged Western media and diplomatic

   Michael Creamer could produce a show
called ``America's Most Inebriated Videos,'' but the veteran
policeman is just glad to show the videotapes in court to convict
drunken drivers.
   During nearly three decades as an officer, Creamer has arrested
scores of drivers who couldn't walk a straight line or recite the
alphabet, only to see them acquitted once they got to court looking
sober and respectable.
   But thanks to one of the nation's insurance giants, he and other
law enforcement agents across the nation have been turning on video
cameras to capture on tape the evidence of drunken driving:
swerving cars, slurred speech, wobbly steps.
   ``With the video cameras, you have a pretty clear case,'' said
Creamer, chief deputy in the Franklin County Sheriff's Department
in Columbus, Ohio. ``The tape says it all.''
   Hartford-based Aetna Life &amp; Casualty has donated more than 300
video cameras to 19 police departments in 10 states under a program
it began last year with Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
   So far, results have been impressive.
   Creamer's department has a perfect conviction rate: All 27
drivers whose videotaped arrests have made it to court have pleaded
guilty.
   In Tampa, Fla., where police have used cameras for almost a
year, 36 out of 37 cases that went to court have resulted in a
conviction _ most through guilty pleas entered after defendants and
defense attorneys watched the tapes.
   ``It's just indisputable evidence,'' said Jimmy Stallings, a
deputy chief in the Tampa Police Department. ``Once the defense
attorney sees what their client looks like at that particular point
in time ... it's very obvious, it's not even close.
   ``Many times, you've got a person who says they had two drinks,
and they're falling down drunk'' on the videotape.
   Aetna concedes that its move is just good business as well as
being philanthropic.
   The company estimates it paid $250 million in claims from
drunken driving accidents last year. The $300,000 worth of video
equipment is a small price to pay to combat what has become a
national epidemic, Aetna says.
   ``The drunken driving problem is a major business problem, in
addition to taking a terrible human toll,'' said Aetna spokesman
Robert Caruthers. ``That's where these cameras fit in. We believe
it has a very strong deterrent effect.''
   The Houston Police Department got the first camera in July 1989.
Since then, Aetna has donated cameras to police departments in
Phoenix; Pittsburgh; Richmond, Va.; Indianapolis; Montgomery, Ala.;
Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and Kansas City, Mo. The
Colorado Highway Patrol has also received cameras.
   Hoping to capitalize on the publicity from anti-drunken driving
campaigns timed for the Memorial Day holiday, Aetna this month
donated another batch of cameras to seven more departments: Austin,
El Paso and Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas; Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y.;
Cleveland; and Cincinnati.
   Aetna plans to donate cameras to departments in Connecticut this
summer.
   Officers turn on the dashboard-mounted cameras as soon as they
spot somebody they suspect is driving drunk.
   The videotapes typically show a car weaving across the road, a
driver stumbling through his alphabet or wobbling as he tries to
walk a straight line, and an officer telling the suspect he is
under arrest for drunken driving.
   Most police departments say they tell drivers they are being
videotaped just before the arrest, but officials also acknowledge
that have not made it mandatory for officers to warn suspects about
the cameras.
   Videotaping suspects before they are read their rights and
without a lawyer present has raised some questions about legality
and constitutionality.
   Loren Siegel, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the ACLU is monitoring the program, but has not decided
whether to challenge it.
   ``Although actual testimony isn't being given, videotaping
without the presence of an attorney raises the self-incrimination
question, and that's a basic part of due process of the law,''
Siegel said. ``One should not be forced to give testimony _ verbal
or otherwise _ against oneself.''
   Drunken driving arrests in the United States reached an all-time
high in 1983 at about 1.92 million, then dropped to about 1.8
million a year since then, according to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.

<TEXT>
   Folks in this parched seaside
resort, perhaps the driest town in California this summer, cope
with drought in their own ways.
   Some blame the government. Some seek charity. And some pour
money on their problems.
   ``At this point, people are really in a frenzy, and there's a
lot of noise about what we should be doing,'' said Tom Rogers,
chairman of the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors. The
water shortage has ``occupied all the politics in the (area) for
the past three or four months.''
   Unlike the rest of southern California, which brings in outside
water in canals and aqueducts, the county and scenic city 100 miles
northwest of Los Angeles rely entirely on groundwater and local
rainfall. That has to serve the county's 300,000 residents plus 5
million tourists a year.
   Years of below-normal precipitation have exhausted one reservoir
and nearly drained another. The region now faces a 45 percent
supply shortfall, forcing the City Council to declare a ``drought
emergency'' in February.
   The council has imposed some drastic measures to foster
conservation. Water rates were hiked drastically. Outdoor
sprinklers and hosing were banned. Other rationing measures were
ordered and three ``drought cops'' were hired to enforce the rules.
   One customer with a leaky toilet recently complained he was
charged $2,725, city officials said.
   Gardening businesses have dried up. Farmworkers also have lost
work, said Josie Mendoza, a case worker at Catholic Charities.
Families are unable to pay their water bills and evictions have
increased, along with requests for assistance and shelter.
   But the drought has created opportunities for some entrepreneurs.
   Steve Bates, 24, delivers water in a 4,000-gallon tanker truck
to spray homeowners' trees, yards and shrubs _ for $80 a load and
$55 an hour.
   ``The best way to describe that truck these days is it's like an
ice-cream truck,'' said Bates, who gets his water from a private
well. ``People are always stopping me while I'm driving down the
street.''
   Landscaper Walter Barrows offers to make a dying lawn look lush
_ by painting it green. A modest front yard costs just $45, he
says. Spray-painted turf doesn't look bad from a distance, but
underfoot it feels like Iowa corn stalks following harvest.
   In nearby affluent enclaves, drilling rig operators are busy
with orders from residents willing to pay upwards of $20,000 for
private wells.
   County environmental health officials say at least 81 well
permits have been issued this year in affluent Montecito, compared
with 12 for the same period last year. Since 1975, 3,295 private
wells have been drilled throughout the county, according to health
officials who monitor well water quality.
   The drilling has prompted worries that an every-man-for-himself
attitude could deplete groundwater.
   ``Those people who have money can do any dang thing they want,''
said E.R. Masonheimer, 76, a retired construction worker who
recalled that just 10,000 people lived in the area when he arrived
in 1917.
   Residents are still buzzing about Harold Simmons, the
Dallas-based corporate raider who paid the nearby Montecito Water
District $25,504 in surcharges for almost 10 million gallons of
water last year at his 23-acre vacation home.
   Simmons apparently was willing to pay any price, said Henry
Muller, a Montecito director. After weeks of wrangling last fall,
Simmons drilled his own well for $18,000.
   For almost 20 years, Santa Barbara city and county officials
have used water as a means of controlling growth.
   If you want to build a house today, you usually have to drill a
well, because the towns of Santa Barbara, Montecito and Goleta
refuse to issue permits for new water hookups, Muller said. The
city of Santa Barbara has clamped down on new construction
altogether because of the drought.
   Local water agencies cannot regulate drilling outside the city
because water is a property right under California law.
   City officials have been considering a number of long-range
solutions to modestly supplement existing water supplies. On
Tuesday, the City Council is expected to approve initial
development of a multimillion-dollar seawater desalinization plant.
   Other options include shipping water by tanker from the
Northwest, arranging water transfers from the state, and drilling
more wells.
   In the meantime, people like 82-year-old Herman Fisher will
continue to use rags to wipe dirt off cars returned to Fiesta Car
Rental.
   ``They don't have enough water for all the people,'' he said.
``Of course, you can't blame people for moving here. It's the
nicest place in the world.''

   The $3 million Highport Marina on Lake
Texoma has a restaurant and even an outdoor dance floor, but these
days it's more of a scuba divers' haven.
   Nearly a month after severe flooding began, the marina and other
lakeshore properties are still under as much as 10 to 12 feet of
water.
   Record rain in the first days of May, following the wettest
spring since 1922, made the man-made lake on the Red River rise to
28 feet above normal, flooding hundreds of properties. Water flowed
over the dam's spillway for only the second time since it was built
in 1944.
   Residents of Lake Texoma's 1,200 miles of shoreline in Texas and
Oklahoma are among thousands whose lives will be disrupted for
months by flooding.
   On Memorial Day, boaters approaching the sprawling Highport
Marina can refuel at a floating gas station and buy food under a
tent pitched on a hill overlooking the submerged Pompanos and
Puffers restaurants.
   ``Many months from now, the lake businesses and residents, along
with more than 8 million visitors who come to Texoma every year,
will still be feeling the flooding's impact,'' said Highport owner
C.D. Loe Jr. ``The whole area will have an economic problem through
next year, including decreased sales tax revenue.''
   Only the rooftops of Loe's two restaurants and a bar can be seen
at the lake about six miles north of Pottsboro. Texoma is slowly
receding, but at 6 inches a day it will take two months just for
water to drain from his development.
   Flooding on the Red and other rivers also prompted disaster
declarations for more than one-third of Arkansas' 75 counties and
caused millions of dollars damage to farmland and homes. Farther
downstream on the Red, more than 100,000 acres have been flooded in
Louisiana. More than 1,000 Oklahomans were affected by flooding and
tornadoes, said the Red Cross.
   Not far south of Lake Texoma, the same storms made the Trinity
River flood in the Dallas area. Downstream in southeastern Texas,
that river will continue to flood low-lying subdivisions until fall
as runoff is slowly released from swollen reservoirs, said David
Haun of the Texas Division of Emergency Management in Austin.
   The upper Trinity River has a normal flow of 7,000 cubic feet
per second, said Trinity River Authority spokesman John Jadrosich
in Arlington. But for the next few weeks, it will course at nearly
three times that rate _ 20,000 cfs.
   ``That's the point at which the river begins to leave its banks
and cause low-level flooding, so that will continue through the end
of the summer,'' he said.
   Texas croplands, many acres of which remain underwater, suffered
hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, said Heather Ball, a
Texas Department of Agriculture economist in Austin.
   Downstream at the Trinity River's Lake Livingston Dam, the
release of water through the spillway has exceeded 100,000 cfs,
five times normal.
   Below Lake Livingston, several hundred homes were flooded and
Jim Mitchum, Liberty County Emergency Management coordinator, said
the high water could affect as many as 7,000 residents.
   Of 24 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reservoirs on the Red,
Trinity and five other river basins, 20 are still storing excess
water, said corps spokesman Ron Ruffennach. It will take more than
two months to drain the excess from some of them, he said.
   Although the corps says the system of dams and levees built
since the 1940s spared Texas from suffering more than the $500
million worth of losses already estimated, critics said more and
better flood control is needed.
   In Arkansas, Gov. Bill Clinton appointed a task force to examine
the corps' release of water from reservoirs along the Red and
Arkansas rivers.
   And the Lake Texoma Association is urging the government to
build more dams upstream on the Red and Washita rivers.
   ``It is obvious that Lake Texoma cannot hold all the water that
the watershed can supply,'' said Loe. ``Where are the politicals
and why are they not doing something about the problem? If Texoma
can't hold the water, why don't we have another lake?''

<HEAD>Communist Official Says Moscow to Review Foreign Military Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union soon will undertake a
``radical review'' of its foreign military assistance programs, a
Soviet Communist Party official said Saturday.
   Andrei S. Grachev, deputy of the international department of the
Communist Party Central Committee, told reporters that Moscow is
putting less emphasis on its relations with the Third World in
light of political changes in Eastern Europe and at home.
   He indicated that foreign military assistance programs could be
readjusted as a result.
   ``These will be subject to a very radical review in the near
future,'' he said.
   Grachev acted as moderator at the first in a series of meetings
between U.S. journalists and Soviet political figures, scholars,
writers and others who are in Washington in connection with the
U.S.-Soviet summit meeting that begins Thursday.
   His comments about foreign military assistance were in response
to a question about whether Moscow intended to reduce its aid to
Cuba and other Third World countries in light of its own domestic
economic and political problems.
   Grachev did not specifically mention Cuba, but his response
seemed to indicate that a review of foreign military assistance
would include all countries currently receiving such aid.
   A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency official told Congress last
month that the Soviets already have been cutting back their
military aid programs. The value of Soviet military assistance to
Third World countries dropped to $17 billion in 1989, about $2
billion below the previous year's figure.
   Lower shipments to Iraq and other Middle East states accounted
for the drop, the DIA official said.
   Grachev also said that while some parts of the Soviet Union are
suffering acute food shortages, Moscow is not looking for emergency
assistance from the United States. He said the main thing the
United States can do for the Soviet economy is help end the arms
race, thereby reducing the burden of Soviet military investment.
   In describing the context of the coming summit meeting between
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush, Grachev
said the key factor was that this would be the first superpower
summit since the demise of the Cold War. The two men last met in
December 1989, a month after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
   Grachev said the tenor of the emerging new world order ``will
depend on the results of the meetings here'' which are expected to
focus on arms control, economic relations and the future political
and military structure of Europe.

   The Magellan spacecraft completed a
four-day run-through of the tasks it will perform when it enters
Venus' orbit to map that planet later this year, scientists said.
   The spacecraft, 104 million miles from Earth and 12 million
miles from Venus, completed 100 hours of maneuvers, data gathering
and communication with ground stations on Earth on Friday
afternoon, said Magellan project manager Anthony J. Spear.
   The spacecraft performed flawlessly, Spear said.
   Magellan is scheduled to go into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10
to begin a 243-day mission mapping about 90 percent of Earth's
sister planet.
   The spacecraft will look for ancient stream channels, shorelines
and other evidence the planet once had oceans.
   Scientists believe an unchecked greenhouse effect _ in which the
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped solar heat _ raised the planet's
temperature until water disappeared.
   Gravity forces on Venus will be studied by plotting the path of
Magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the planet's surface,
then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977 miles.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.

<HEAD>As S&amp;L Losses Mount, Legislators Focus on Justice Department Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's bill for cleaning up the savings
and loan crisis is rising _ along with the temperatures of
legislators who accuse the Justice Department of dragging its feet
on prosecuting S&amp;L fraud.
   As the rhetoric heats up, some department officials are hinting
that major indictments could come down soon.
   ``We do have some excellent investigations that we hope will be
very productive in the very near future,'' Marvin Collins, the U.S.
attorney in Fort Worth, Texas, said last Thursday.
   Collins declined to elaborate, since the Justice Department's
policy is not to discuss pending cases. But there is speculation
that indictments could be announced in the coming weeks against S&amp;L
high-fliers in Texas, a hotbed of thrift fraud and failure.
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, has sharply boosted its
estimates of how much the government will have to borrow to clean
up the savings and loan mess. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
told Congress this past week the borrowing need is between $90
billion and $130 billion.
   The new assessment came after the administration insisted for
more than a year that most of the problem could be resolved with
the $50 billion in borrowing authority included in the S&amp;L bailout
bill.
   U.S. taxpayers will have to shell out an astounding $325 billion
or so to cover losses to depositors of the federally insured
thrifts.
   Some Democratic legislators, perhaps sensing a potential
campaign issue, are becoming more muscular in their approach to the
S&amp;L debacle.
   And some government agencies, such as the Office of Thrift
Supervision, seem to be taking a higher profile as well. Timothy
Ryan, who became the OTS director in early April, held his first
news conference last Wednesday. He outlined a ``broad game plan of
enforcement'' under which the OTS and other federal agencies plan
to coordinate efforts with the Justice Department to bring
perpetrators of S&amp;L fraud to justice.
   At the White House, President Bush said the worsening thrift
crisis ``causes me great concern'' and the first priority of
government policy makers is to protect the depositors.
   The House Banking Committee held a hearing Tuesday and Wednesday
on the $1 billion collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association, a Denver thrift that counted Bush's son, Neil, among
its directors.
   Committee Chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said he will
ask Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to testify before the panel as
it broadens its S&amp;L investigation.
   Another Democrat on the committee, Rep. Frank Annunzio of
Illinois, was more strident.
   ``We must find out why the Justice Department is so reluctant to
investigate savings and loan cases,'' Annunzio told the hearing
Wednesday. ``The taxpayers have a half-trillion reasons to want an
answer to the question: When are the savings and loan crooks going
to jail?''
   In fact, some of them already have been put behind bars since
Congress passed the S&amp;L bailout bill nine months ago. Twenty-three
former thrift officers and roughly the same number of real estate
developers, brokers and accountants are serving terms ranging from
six months to 30 years for bank fraud, conspiracy and related
charges, according to the Justice Department.
   But Justice still has a backlog of thousands of potential
criminal cases under investigation, ranging from simple teller
thefts to serious abuses that dragged down thrifts.
   ``The cases themselves are very difficult to make,'' Justice
Department spokesman Doug Tillett said Thursday. ``It's very
difficult to prove criminal intent.''
   Nearly all of the convictions so far have been in southwest
Texas. The department has set up S&amp;L fraud task forces in 27 cities
across the country.
   Tillett said government investigators have to trace ``very
complex, usually bogus'' financial transactions, with the result
that it takes three to four years on average to build a fraud case.
   Tillett declined to comment on whether the department planned to
announce big indictments soon. He did promise, however, that
``you're going to see prosecutions.''
   Concern about the pace of investigations and prosecutions isn't
limited to the Democrats on the banking committee.
   ``It's not a partisan thing at all,'' said a committee staffer
on the Republican side, who asked not to be identified by name.
``We're more than prepared to help to get the attorney general up
here.''
   He was more inclined than the Democrats, however, to give the
Justice Department the benefit of the doubt on the foot-dragging
issue. ``I would assume that they're doing the best they can,'' he
said.

   President Roh Tae-woo said Saturday
that Japan's apologies for its brutal colonial rule might not
satisfy all South Koreans, but he urged them to look to the future,
not the past.
   Roh returned from an emotional three-day visit to Japan aimed at
beginning a new partnership between the Asian neighbors. At its
conclusion, he invited Emperor Akihito to make the first Japanese
imperial visit to South Korea.
   During Roh's visit, Akihito expressed ``deepest regret for the
sufferings and pain'' Japan inflicted on Korea during its colonial
rule from 1910 to 1945. Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
extended his ``sincere remorse and honest apologies.''
   Kaifu's apology was Japan's clearest statement of regret ever
over its military past. But Roh acknowledged many South Koreans
would be dissatisfied with it.
   ``I well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have
about what went on between our country and Japan in the past. No
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory,'' Roh said at a news
conference at Seoul's airport.
   During much of the colonial period, Koreans were forced to speak
Japanese, use Japanese names and worship the late Japanese Emperor
Hirohito, Akihito's father. Many Koreans died after being
conscripted into Japan's army or in dangerous jobs as laborers in
Japan.
   Before leaving Tokyo on Saturday, Roh said Akihito's words of
regret ``were very significant,'' and said the emperor and Kaifu
had ``expressed a common awareness about this unfortunate period
between our two countries.''
   ``With this, I feel that myself and the people of my country
feel we can put the unfortunate period of our history behind us,''
Roh said.
   In Tokyo, about 20,000 police had been mobilized to guard
against threats to Roh from both rightist and leftist groups, but
no incidents were reported.
   During a brief visit to Osaka in western Japan on his way home,
about 30 leftists demonstrated peacefully against Roh's visit,
police said.
   Roh's visit had sparked far bigger protests in South Korea.
Before he left for Japan, radicals and human rights groups
demonstrated almost daily, demanding that he cancel his visit.
   One man slashed his belly with a knife in front of the Japanese
Embassy in Seoul in protest.
   Roh said after his return that he believed Kaifu's and Akihito's
statements of regret were sufficient and urged that they be
accepted.
   ``Even if we may feel that the Japanese apologies do not fully
live up to our expectations, we should accept them with magnanimity
and generosity now that Japan has forthrightly admitted its
mistakes, reflected on them and apologized,'' he said.
   ``With that, I believe we must now forge a new era of
neighborliness and friendship,'' he added.
   Some sore points remain unresolved, including discrimination
against Korean residents in Japan and health care for Korean
survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Roh made clear that he had asked Japan to move forward on those
issues, but he said he was satisfied with the progress so far.
   ``If we are to promote the peace and prosperity of northeast
Asia and also usher in an Asian-Pacific age by the 21st century, we
should advance friendly cooperation with Japan, our next-door
neighbor,'' he said.

<HEAD>West German Calls for New U.S.-European Economic Alliance</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher called Saturday for a new, treaty-based economic
partnership between the United States and Europe to ensure that the
reduction in political and military tensions is not replaced by
wars of trade and technology.
   ``The Atlantic must not grow wider as a result of European
unification,'' Genscher declared.
   In a commencement address at the Georgetown University School of
Foreign Service, Genscher also called for the Soviet Union to
become a full partner, through the 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe, in developing ``a stable European
confederation from the Atlantic to the Urals.''
   Genscher made no mention of Soviet President Michael S.
Gorbachev's warning on Friday that the Soviet Union would keep its
troops in eastern Germany and would review its participation in the
CSCE process if a reunited Germany is a military _ rather than just
political _ member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But Genscher, who met with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, in Geneva on Thursday, did affirm his government's
determination that ``a united Germany will remain a decisive
advocate of the close bonds between Europe and America, and will
remain a member of NATO.''
   Genscher's commencement address duplicated, in large measure, a
speech he made to the American Society of Newspaper Editors in
Washington several weeks earlier, when he called upon the United
States and Canada to join members of the European Community ``in a
joint declaration heralding a new Atlantic partnership, a
declaration encompassing all the political, economic, technological
and cultural aspects of our relationship.''
   On Saturday, he said such a declaration ``must be followed by a
European-American treaty aimed at shaping the future.'' He did not
elaborate as to what that might specifically entail, but said ``the
right decision to reduce political and military tension must not be
replaced by a wrong decision to engage in wars of trade and
technology.''
   ``National thinking is no longer in line with the new challenges
confronting the whole of mankind,'' Genscher said. ``The future
belongs to a worldwide domestic policy which must involve a new
culture entailing the coexistence of the nations.''
   By 1992, trade among the 12 member nations of the EC will be
simplified by the lifting of hundreds of tariffs and other trade
restrictions. Many American business and political leaders fear
this single-market system will unfairly restrict U.S. and
non-European trade.
   Genscher said he was confident that the summit between
Presidents Bush and Gorbachev in the week ahead ``will lead to a
new, broad-based breakthrough'' on nuclear arms control and than an
agreement on conventional troop cuts will be reached by the end of
the year.
   The conventional pact, he said, ``will pave the way for further
far-reaching reductions in troops and for the reorganization of all
troops in Europe.''
   The global challenge now, said Genscher, ``is to ensure the
survival of mankind. The vicious circle of poverty, overpopulation
and the destruction of the environment has reached new proportions.
Life on our planet is being threatened. Now that Europe is
achieving peace, now that East and West are bringing their
senseless waste of resources on the arms race to an end, mankind's
war with nature must also end.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met Saturday
with the directors of three national weapons laboratories but made
no decision on their request to ground a short-range nuclear
missile carried by Air Force planes.
   The meeting focused on the Short Range Attack Missile-A, or
SRAM-A, which are carried aboard B-52, B-1 and FB-111 bombers that
are on alert. The laboratory directors fear that a plane will crash
or catch on fire by accident and that the flames will spread to the
missiles, destroying protective walls and dispersing radioactive
material into open air.
   The directors believe the missiles should be taken out of the
air and stored.
   ``They had a very good discussion. Cheney was briefed first hand
by the lab directors, but they reached no decision,'' said Tom
Olson, a spokesman for the Energy Department.
   Defense Department spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi said most of what was
discussed at the session was classified.
   Also at the meeting were Energy Secretary James Watkins and Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The three directors were Albert Narath, president of Sandia
National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M.; John Nuckolls, director
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California; and
Sigfried Heckler, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in
New Mexico.
   Their safety concerns about the SRAM-As emerged Wednesday at a
hearing held by the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on strategic
forces.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who has an Air Force
Base with combat-ready B-52s in his district, telephoned Cheney
following the testimony to urge a meeting with the directors.
   The three laboratories design and test nuclear weapons, but they
are manufactured elsewhere. How many of the missiles are currently
being flown aboard ``alert'' strategic bombers has not been
disclosed.

   Radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin failed Saturday
to win a majority in balloting for president of Russia, the largest
Soviet republic, but said he'll start a new campaign Monday for
another election.
   The Congress of the Russian Federation will take new nominations
then, and Yeltsin said he will stick to his platform of
transferring economic and political decision-making power from
central authorities to the republic _ despite opposition from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I am not going to change on matters of principle,'' he said as
he strode through the Kremlin grounds after Saturday's runoff
election in the parliament.
   Gorbachev, who holds the posts of Soviet president and general
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, accused Yeltsin on
Wednesday of being anti-socialist and said his demands for Russian
sovereignty would mean ``the breakup of the Soviet Union.''
   If Yeltsin ultimately wins Russia's presidential election, the
post would give him and his supporters a prominent platform from
which to continue their campaign to accelerate Gorbachev's
political and economic reforms.
   Yeltsin pledged Friday to defend the republic from Kremlin
interference but also said he could bury personal differences and
work with Gorbachev.
   In Friday's first round of balloting he won 497 votes, forcing a
runoff on Saturday. But Yeltsin received 503 votes in the second
round, still short of the 531 needed to win.
   His opponent, Krasnodar Communist Party chief Ivan Polozkov, won
473 votes in the first round and 458 in the second.
   The Russian Congress is electing the first president of the
republic. By far the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
Russia comprises more than two-thirds of the country's territory
and is home to half the Soviet populace.
   Yeltsin told reporters he thought he could swing blocks of votes
by agreeing to include various legislators in the government, but
he offered no specifics.
   Noting his gains in the second round, he jokingly told reporters
and supporters outside the Great Kremlin Palace that ``I need 531.
That means we should go for five rounds, and every round we will
add six votes.''
   He said he expected Polozkov to withdraw in favor of another
Gorbachev supporter, Yuri A. Manayenkov, first secretary of the
Communist Party organization in the Lipetsk region, in southern
Russia.
   The first candidate backed by Gorbachev, Russian premier
Alexander Vlasov, withdrew from the race Friday after it became
clear he lacked Yeltsin's popularity.
   The race for the Russian presidency marks the latest stage in a
remarkable political comeback for Yeltsin, 59, who was ousted as
Moscow party chief in 1987 after urging Gorbachev to speed up the
reforms.
   As Yeltsin left the red walls of the ancient Kremlin, he avoided
a crowd of several hundred supporters waiting in Red Square.
   Two women handed him bouquets of flowers. One woman fell to her
knees in front of him, but he raised her to her feet and said:
``Please, don't,'' then stepped into a waiting car.
   The car drove past the adjacent Rossiya Hotel where about 300
more Yeltsin backers chanted his name and the word ``referendum,''
demanding a direct presidential vote.
   ``This election has been undemocratic,'' said legislator Viktor
Aksyuchits, addressing the crowd through a bullhorn. ``We demand
that the voice of Russian citizens be heard.''
   Olga Yulitova, a doctor, said: ``the people want Yeltsin. But
our opinions don't matter. The (Communist Party) apparatus is
against him.''
   Police looked on but did not interfere with the demonstration.
   Yeltsin told reporters he believed ``a direct vote for president
of Russia ... would be the most objective'' means of settling the
race.
   ``Nominations will take place again on Monday. I think that I
will be nominated, and instead of Polozkov, Manayenkov will be
nominated,'' Yeltsin said.
   He urged Gorbachev ``to take a step forward, and come halfway. I
am ready to meet him halfway.''
   Asked what step he wanted Gorbachev to take, Yeltsin said he
should withdraw his criticism.
   ``At least he should not say the words he said in the hall,'' he
said.

   Security forces waged a gun battle
Saturday with residents of the city's poorest neighborhood, leaving
at least 18 people dead and more than 200 wounded, police and
witnesses said.
   Police and doctors at a local hospital said they expected the
death toll to rise as ambulances picked up bodies that lined the
narrow streets of the old walled city, a winding congested maze of
mud brick houses and shanties.
   The battle, which lasted for more than two hours, forced
authorities to cancel a two-hour curfew break, they said.
   As security troops cordoned off the area and prepared to conduct
house-to-house searches, the fighting spread to other parts of
Hyderabad, the second-largest city in southern Sindh Province.
   According to official count, at least 75 people have been killed
and hundreds more wounded since May 15 in ethnic-related violence
and indiscriminate shootings in this city of 3 million people.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bloodshed. Police
blame a militant faction of the Mohajir Qami Movement, a small
political party representing descendants of Moslem Indians who
immigrated to Pakistan during the 1947 partition of the
subcontinent.
   The movement is demanding recognition as Pakistan's fifth
nationality, along with the Punjabis, Pathans, Sindhis and Baluch.
   Witnesses said Saturday's gun battle erupted as security forces
moved into the old city, home to about 100,000 people, searching
for weapons.
   The residents, most of them Mohajirs, apparently thought rival
Sindhi nationalists planned to attack and opened fire with
automatic weapons, killing two officers and wounding seven others
before security forces returned fire, witnesses said.
   About 2,000 combat-ready paramilitary units, riot police and
rangers have patrolled the city to try to contain the violence.
Army-supervised curfews have become a way of life.
   Thousands of security force members swept through Hyderabad and
across Sindh on Thursday and Friday and arrested more than 800
suspects. Police said they included members of the Mohajir Qami
Movement and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's
Party.
   In recent years the province has been the site of constant
kidnappings and assassinations. More than 2,000 people have been
killed.
   The worst carnage occurred on Sept. 30 in Hyderabad, when at
least 300 people were killed in a massacre that lasted only 23
minutes. Those suspected of organizing the killings have not been
arrested, fueling fears that the problem is beyond the government's
control.
   In Karachi, the provincial capital, ethnic strife and political
rivalries have turned Pakistan's largest city into a battleground.
The main combatants are Ms. Bhutto's supporters and members of the
Mohajir Qami Movement.
   Opposition politicians have accused Ms. Bhutto's 17-month-old
government of failing to curb the violence in her home province.
   She has said the provincial government has not done enough to
curb the escalating violence and lawlessness. But she accused
neighboring India of stirring up trouble in Sindh and in the
eastern province of Punjab.
   New Delhi blames Pakistan for violent separatist movements in
Indian Punjab and Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state that has a
Moslem majority.

   The Defense Department said Saturday the
remains of two Korean War soldiers being returned on Monday have
been identified by North Korean officials as being from Utah and
Pennsylvania.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi noted, however, that the United
States would not be certain of the identities of the remains at
least until it receives the report of forensics specialists at a
Honolulu military laboratory.
   The North Koreans said May 14 that they would turn over the
remains of five Americans who lost their lives in the Korean War,
which began in 1950 and finally ended in a truce in 1953.
   The North Koreans plan to return the remains Monday through a
congressional delegation at the village of Panmunjom where truce
negotiations were held during the Korean War.
   The Pentagon said the Koreans identified the remains as those of:
   _Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden, Utah, who was
listed as missing in action on Feb. 13, 1951. The Army believes he
died as a prisoner of war the following month.
   _Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, listed as missing Feb. 12,
1951. He disappeared near the village of Hoengson, as did Saunders.
   Bodanyi said the Army has not been able to reach the relatives
of Seaton, who lived in Chester, Pa.
   The Washington Post in Saturday editions quoted Saunders' widow,
LaRelle Basoco of San Bernardino, Calif., as saying that ``after 40
years it's a relief.''
   ``It seems like it has been up in the air all these years
because we've had no body,'' she said.
   She said she remarried and moved to California about six years
after Saunders was listed as missing. ``I used to worry about it a
lot after I remarried _ that he would come back and what would I
do,'' she said. ``But it's a relief.''
   The newspaper quoted her as saying that Saunders ``thought it
was dirty over there and he didn't like it.''
   ``He was anxious to get back,'' she said. ``He didn't like it.
He didn't write too much about what the war was like because he
didn't want to worry me.''

   Actor Don Johnson says he's satisfied after
an arbitrator ruled that parts of his house were poorly built and
the contractor was ordered to pay damages.
   ``The people who did the actual work will finally be paid,''
Johnson said after the hearing.
   The contractor, Duddy-Viele Construction Inc. of Vail, sued
Johnson in November after he refused to make a final payment of
$95,813 on the $604,085 job. But the settlement requires
Duddy-Viele to pay Johnson and subcontractors nearly $112,000, said
Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz.
   Johnson earlier had said he was withholding payment because
floors and beams in the Woody Creek home were cracked and sagging,
plumbing leaked and backed up, and doors and windows were not
airtight.
   A panel of three arbitrators visited the home, and took
testimony from Johnson and other witnesses, Mintz said.
   Johnson's attorney, Robert Shoecraft, said that much of the
money Duddy-Viele claimed Johnson owed it was actually money
Duddy-Viele owed subcontractors.
   Duddy-Viele must pay more than $64,000 to subcontractors, and
$47,900 to Johnson to compensate him for ``the costs to remedy the
defective workmanship,'' said Mintz.
   Mike Ellis of Duddy-Viele said Friday that no company officials
would be available to comment on the settlement until after
Memorial Day.

   Acknowledging he doesn't have ``many more years left,'' Brennan
said he's trying to let the American people know exactly how the
Supreme Court works. One way of accomplishing that would be
televising court sessions, he said.
   ``I would love it. I'm the only one presently of the nine who

Brennan.
   Nonetheless, he thinks the day is inevitable that Supreme Court

   A union group has sent a letter to Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, informing him that the award he
received last month from Bellarmine College comes from a school
that uses non-union labor.
   ``We view the Bellarmine Award as rank hypocrisy,'' said Jerry
Hammond, secretary-treasurer of the Kentucky State Building and
Construction Trades Council.
   Bellarmine recognized the rights of Polish workers, Hammond
said, but at home college officials haven't ``practiced what they
pretend to preach.''
   The letter congratulated Walesa on receiving the award, which is
given to those who ``exemplify charity, justice and temperateness
in dealing with controversy.''
   But it also said the college has awarded multimillion-dollar
construction contracts to companies that ``exploit their workers''
by paying wages below union scale and refusing to provide health
insurance.
   College spokesmen said Friday that the school does not
discriminate between union and non-union contractors. Bids for
construction are awarded based on the ``lowest and best bidder,''
said Bill Lynch, a retired consulting engineer who serves on the
college's construction committee.

   Actor Marlon Brando hired a former chief
pathologist for New York City to perform an independent autopsy on
the man Brando's son is accused of killing, a county coroner
official said.
   Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner of New York,
performed the autopsy on Dag Drollet, 26, of Tahiti, coroner's
supervisor David Campbell said Friday. The autopsy's results were
not released.
   Baden also reviewed coroner's documents filed in connection with
a first-degree murder charge against Christian Brando, 32. Drollet
was found shot to death at Marlon Brando's exclusive estate on May
16.
   ``We wanted someone with impeccable credentials to review the
way the coroner's autopsy was conducted,'' said Daniel Stormer, a
lawyer for Brando.
   Baden served as a pathologist for congressional committees
investigating the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and
civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   Stormer said Drollet's family had granted permission to perform
the second autopsy.
   The defense maintains the shooting was an accident that occurred
during an argument over Drollet's treatment of Cheyenne Brando,
sister of Christian Brando and daughter of the Oscar-winning actor.

   With David, 27, making the field at Monaco, it will be the first
time a son of a world champion starts in a Formula One race. He
just barely made the 26-car field, qualifying for the next-to-last
spot.
   He averaged 87.15 mph on the twisting street course, a far cry
from 38-year-old brother Geoff's Indy qualifying mark of 216.58 mph
in winning a seventh-row position in Indianapolis.
   Still, David is happy to be racing on Sunday.
   ``I am absolutely delighted to have made it,'' David said.

   French troops guarded key
installations in this oil city Saturday, enforcing a calm after two
days of riots and hostage-taking. The capital of Libreville also
appeared calm.
   The riots were triggered by the unexplained death of an
opposition leader in a Libreville hotel Wednesday. Opposition
supporters burned shops and government buildings in Libreville and
Port Gentil.
   The French consulate in Port Gentil was burned and the consul
held hostage for several hours Wednesday. On Thursday, 10 oil
company executives were held for most of the day.
   The hostages were released after French troops arrived, but oil
production remained shut down.
   French authorities insisted Saturday that their goal was to
protect French and other expatriate workers, and they would not
intervene to protect President Omar Bongo.
   By Saturday evening, more than 1,300 evacuees _ French, Belgian,
Dutch and English _ had been flown to Paris.
   Meanwhile, results of the autopsy conducted on Joseph Rendambe,
secretary-general of the Gabon Progess Party, were still not known.
Official sources said Rendjambe might have died as the result of an
injection of a liquid whose composition was undetectable. Earlier
the government said traces of needle marks had been found on the
stomach of Rendjambe, a diabetic.
   Bongo's government has said it had nothing to do with the death
of the opposition leader, whom it described as a patriot. Rendjambe
was viewed as a moderate in Gabon political circles, and his party
also was held to be among the most moderate of opposition groups.
   Violence spread to Lambarene, 140 miles southeast of Libreville,
on Friday. Protesters attacked a prison, freeing many inmates.
Shops and government buildings and vehicles were burned, witnesses
said.
   Violence also was reported in Mouila, 200 miles south of
Libreville, according to the witnesses, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Bongo, after visiting several areas badly hit by the rioting,
said that if the demonstrations continued he ``would pull out all
the stops'' to restore order, news reports said. He did not
elaborate.
   Information Minister Jean-Remy Pendy-Bouyiki appealed on
national television for an end to the violence to faciliate the
country's move from a one-party state to a democracy.
   The oil-rich country had suffered a wave of riots in January as
opposition groups pressed Bongo to accept opposition parties. The
president ultimately agreed to hold a national conference on the
issue, and he accepted their recommendation to install a multiparty
democracy.
   The tension eased after the conference, and on Monday the
constitution was amended to permit the opposition to contest
elections in September.

   Bandits swiped more than $250,000 after breaking
into a pair of automatic teller machines at a bank's branch office,
police said Saturday.
   The money was taken from a Chemical Bank branch in Manhattan
sometime between closing Friday and Saturday morning, when bank
security personnel discovered the break-in, said Chemical spokesman
Charles Salmans.
   ``We're still trying to determine the exact amount that was
taken,'' said Salmans. Police Sgt. Ed Burns said more than $250,000
was reported missing.
   There was no evidence of forced entry at the bank, said Burns.
   ``The machines are open and the money is gone,'' he said.
   Chemical Bank has 120 cash machines in the city, and Salmans _
while not providing any figures _ said thefts from the machines are
rare.

<HEAD>Feds Won't Tell Family Whereabouts Of Man Missing for 12 Years</HEAD>

   Federal officials know the whereabouts of
a former police chief who disappeared 12 years ago but, at his
instruction, they can't tell his wife and two children.
   The Social Security Administration informed the family of John
Hoyt Kelley on Friday that Kelley is alive but does not want his
whereabouts revealed.
   Despite the distress it causes his family, federal privacy laws
require the agency to respect his wishes.
   ``How do we know he's still alive? They just told us they
know,'' said a sobbing Linda Kelley Bardin, Kelley's former wife.
``We don't have any proof he's alive. I can't believe he wouldn't
want to let his kids know where he is or even to talk to them.''
   Kelley was declared legally dead in 1987 to allow his children
to draw $17,363 from three life insurance policies.
   Ms. Bardin said she received a letter Thursday instructing her
to call a Social Security representative in El Dorado. She said she
talked to Betty Harper there Friday morning.
   ``She said `I have some good news,''' Ms. Bardin said. ``I said
`He's alive' and she said yes, but he had signed papers saying that
he did not want his kids or me to know his whereabouts.''
   ``I'm not convinced. They tell me they did it, but I'm not
convinced the man they've found is him,'' she said.
   Ms. Harper, reached by telephone Friday, confirmed that Kelley's
former wife had been notified that her ex-husband was alive, but
said further details could not be released.
   Kelley joined the Crossett Police Department in 1964. He
divorced his first wife 10 years later and was police chief by the
time he met Linda in 1975. He was 34, she was 27.
   Ms. Bardin recalled that the family was happy, even though
Kelley kept secrets about where he went and how he spent his money.
   She said she has learned he received $17,000 from the sale of
his father's estate through 1976 and 1977, but said she had no idea
at the time that he received so much money.
   Then threatening telephone calls began from people insisting
Kelley owed them money, Ms. Bardin said. Kelley began disappearing
for days at a time.
   He resigned as police chief in January 1977 and moved the family
to Little Rock, where he worked as a salesman.
   One day in 1978, he got up, helped his children get ready for
school, kissed his wife and told her he loved her, dropped the
children off at a bus stop and drove away. He never returned.

<HEAD>Neighbor Says Woman Caring for 54 Kids Was Helping Struggling
Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A modern-day Mother Hubbard who allegedly had
54 children in her suburban Maryland home when authorities raided
it last week was described Saturday by a neighbor as ``a lot of
help to people who couldn't afford'' licensed care.
   ``She was real particular about the children,'' said Albert H.
Abney, 44, who lives two houses down from Nannie Marie Pressley in
the Washington suburb of Oxon Hill, Md.
   Authorities who searched Mrs. Pressley's home on Thursday said a
lone teen-ager was keeping watch over the children, ranging from
infants to 10-year-olds.
   Authorities said 13 infants were in bedrooms on the first floor
of the two-story house, and nine of those infants were in infant
car seats. Authorities said the older children sat on benches in
the basement.
   Mrs. Pressley, 53, was served with a letter telling her to stop
caring for children in her home, said Ardis Welch, a spokeswoman
for the Maryland Department of Human Resources.
   The case has been referred to prosecutors, authorities said. But
Prince George's County Police Lt. Mark A. Wright said Saturday he
had not been asked to help serve any criminal warrants.
   Ms. Welch said it's a misdemeanor punishable with up to a $500
fine to operate day care from a home without a license. The state
limit on home care is six children, she added.
   Felony charges can be brought if there is evidence of abuse or
unsafe conditions, she said.
   Mrs. Pressley did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment Saturday.
   Ms. Welch said the raid was the result of a complaint, since
state authorities lack the resources to search for unlicensed home
providers.
   ``The need is too great and the practice is too pervasive,'' she
said.
   Abney said Mrs. Pressley fulfilled such a need.
   ``She was a lot of help to a lot of people who couldn't afford
to pay $50 to $75 a week for day care,'' Abney said. ``Mrs.
Pressley would charge people $15 to $20 and maybe a little more.''
   Mrs. Pressley often let women get by without paying accumulated
bills as high as $400, he said. ``I used to tell her she was crazy
for doing that.''
   He said a lot of the clients were young, single mothers. ``She
couldn't say no to that mother.''
   ``I'm not sure I'd know the woman if I'd see her,'' said another
neighbor from across the busy, four-lane street. But the neighbor,
who asked to remain anonymous, said she was aware that day care was
being offered. She said the exterior of the house was maintained
``very nicely.''
   Another neighbor who asked that his name not be used, said he
noticed more and more ``younger girls'' bringing their children by
for help.
   The neighbor, who has lived near Mrs. Pressley for about eight
years and said she has been caring for children that long, added:
``I think people did depend on her. ... If she wasn't that good,
she wouldn't be in business that long.''
   He said the neighborhood of modestly priced homes was occupied
by working people and a large number of retirees.
   In an interview published in Saturday editions of The Washington
Post, Mrs. Pressley acknowledged that she cared for children
without a license but usually cared for no more than 20.
   She said there were so many children because she had been giving
a birthday party. She had left the children temporarily with her
teen-age daughter when she went to the store for supplies, Mrs.
Pressley said.
   ``Yeah, I know it was wrong,'' Mrs. Pressley said about keeping
kids without a license. ``Sometimes people ask you, `Can I bring my
baby over?' and you have to say yes.''
   Mrs. Pressley told the newspaper the children were in the
basement because they had been watching a videotape.
   The Post described the interior of the house as immaculate and
well furnished.
   Labor Department figures say 57 percent of all women with
children under 6 work outside the home, compared with 12 percent in
1950. The Children's Defense Fund, a Washington-based advocacy
group, predicts that by 1995 two-thirds of all pre-school children
will have working mothers.
   Ms. Welch said she was unaware of any other instance of finding
so many children being cared for in one home.

   Here is the text of the statement
released Saturday by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine, as translated from Arabic into English by The Associated
Press:
   As a result of the latest crime committed by Zionism, the foster
daughter of America, international changes have emerged in the
reactions, which required the organization of Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine to take time in declaring its position
until all reactions had been scrutinized.
   A big storm has been unleashed. Hardly anyone has been left
without condemning and declaring profound dismay. A unique global
outrage was triggered off, but it was clear that it was only an
artificial patronage of our people's security against the
executioners and their masters. The bloodletting continued. It was
a hollow storm of empty words representing a new method to diffuse
the anger of the honest freedom-loving strugglers and manifesting
the orchestrated conspiratorial role of the international community
against our sacred cause.
   The Organization of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine declares that the effective deterrent is force. America
is directly responsible for shedding the blood of our people and
our cause. America seeks at all costs to retain its base, Israel,
in the east and will not permit even verbal resolutions of an
adverse nature against Israel.
   We warn America and Israel that future developments will not be
in the interests of either of them. They will realize that the
blood will not be wasted. They will pay the price.
   Lastly, we address warm tribute to our struggling people in
Palestine and call for redoubled action and uprising.
   Have patience for dawn will be coming.
   Peace upon those who serve justice for the sake of justice.
   The Organization of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine.

<HEAD>Anti-Nuclear Activists Plot Strategies For Halting Testing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Grass-roots activists from around the
world came together Saturday with songs, shouts and sad stories of
radiation damage in Soviet Kazakhstan, and they discussed ways to
halt all nuclear testing.
   ``We're poisoning our air, we're poisoning our soil, we're
poisoning our water,'' former bomb-maker Ted Taylor told
participants in the four-day conference. The U.S. nuclear physicist
said Americans and Soviets are more likely to be killed by the
pollution from their own nuclear testing than by an enemy bomb.
   Although superpower tensions are easing, the activists decided
they have virtually no hope of persuading U.S., British and French
leaders to stop testing nuclear bombs anytime soon. The United
States detonated an underground bomb on Friday.
   The activists are concentrating instead on Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said Dr. Bernard Lown, an organizer of the
conference and president of International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War.
   The conference was highlighted by Saturday's festive,
multinational rally and a political victory for the hosts, a Kazakh
nuclear group called Nevada-Semipalatinsk, named after the U.S. and
Soviet test sites.
   On Wednesday, Kazakhstan's legislature voted unanimously to ask
the Soviet government to halt all nuclear explosions at
Semipalatinsk, located in the northern steppes of the Central Asian
republic.
   The American delegation to the conference, in contrast, was
outraged to learn their government had set off another underground
nuclear explosion in Nevada.
   ``I feel ashamed and angered,'' Lown said. ``This makes no
sense. Why are we conducting nuclear tests just a few days before
the summit?''
   Gorbachev is to meet President Bush in Washington this week, and
the superpowers hope to complete an agreement to reduce long-range
nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   The activists sent a telegram urging the leaders to halt nuclear
testing. But no serious discussion of the issue is expected at the
summit, Lown said, quoting Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   Conference leaders met with Shevardnadze on Tuesday in Moscow,
where he restated the Soviet willingness to stop nuclear testing if
the United States does.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to sign protocols on verifying
compliance to a 150-kiloton ceiling for nuclear tests. Although a
pair of treaties setting the ceiling were signed in the early
1970's, they have never been ratified by the U.S. Senate, and
previous American administrations expressed doubt about Soviet
compliance.
   U.S. policy, outlined by an American diplomat in Moscow, is that
exploding nuclear bombs under the Nevada desert is necessary for
testing safety and new weapons.
   But the Kazakhs of Central Asia have used Gorbachev's policies
of glasnost and democratization to temporarily halt the blasts and
pollution they blame for health problems. Semipalatinsk has been
silent since October.
   At the conference, participants saw a graphic documentary film
called ``Testing Ground,'' which mixed scenes of deformed local
children with film clips of mushroom clouds blasting sheep off the
Soviet prairies.
   Still births have tripled near the test site since 1970, said
Dr. Samaim Balmkhanoe, assistant director of the local radiation
research institute.
   Nevada-Semipalatinsk, led by a Kazakh poet named Olzhas
Suleimenoz, had won a Soviet government promise to end testing at
Semipalatinsk by 1993, but plans to move testing to Novaya Zemlya
in the Artic could be delayed.
   The rally on Saturday appeared to have official support: Giant
bilingual banners in English, Russian and Kazakh called for peace
and truckloads of pastries were sold from state-run kiosks.
   But local journalists said their coverage of the conference was
being restricted by the state-run media, Suleimenoz said.
   The government ordered the demonstration moved from a downtown
square to a remote stadium where passers-by would not be likely to
join in. Turnout was less than 15,000 instead of the expected
50,000.
   The authorities ``are afraid of public action,'' Suleimenoz said
in an interview at Saturday's rally, which ended with the crowd
carrying him out of the stadium on their shoulders, chanting his
name.
   ``If they don't show us support, they will lose authority,''
Suleimanoz said. ``Communists, and non-communists alike are united
here.''

   Mayor Gavriil Popov said Saturday he would
temporarily allow only Muscovites to shop in the capital's stores
for fear that continued mass panic buying would play into the hands
of ``conservative forces.''
   The consumer fever began Thursday after Soviet Premier Nikolai
I. Ryzhkov announced an economic reform plan that would triple
bread prices July 1 and raise prices on most other goods in January.
   ``As a direct result of the speech, there has been a gigantic
explosion of demand for anything that can be bought,'' Popov told a
news conference at the Moscow City Council.
   If Muscovites enraged by empty stores riot, ``that would only
profit the conservative forces who are dreaming of provoking mass
clashes that could serve as a pretext to bring on measures against
perestroika,'' he said.
   In the past two days, people have bought seven times as much
flour and vegetable oil as usual and doubled their purchases of
salt, said Yuri Luzhkov, head of the City Council's executive
committee.
   He said a two-week period during which would-be purchasers must
show identification with their Moscow addresses would allow time to
calm the panic and let city officials work out other measures to
cope with heightened demand. The two-week period is to begin Monday.
   Many other regions of the country began similar residents-only
rules months ago, and some have long been on a straight ration
system requiring coupons for such basics as meat, cheese and
butter. Sugar is rationed throughout the Soviet Union.
   But Moscow, long the country's showcase, remained relatively
rich in goods and even had enough to supply an estimated 1 million
out-of-town visitors a day.
   The sudden rush on the stores ``is a reason for frustration _ we
were like the last bastion of a non-administrative economy,'' said
Sergei Stankevich, Moscow's deputy mayor.
   Stankevich and Popov, both members of the opposition group in
the Soviet Congress and thus more radical in their thinking than
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said the Ryzhkov plan and its
consequences showed it was time for the government to step down.
   ``Our government can't think ahead of events,'' Stankevich said.
``This is a real weakness and it's unimaginable that we still have
this kind of government.''
   Popov said people lacked confidence in the national Supreme
Soviet, which has the power to vote down the economic plan but has
rarely defied the government.
   City officials said they expected the residents-only buying plan
to provoke conflicts with the regions that surround Moscow _
Vladimir, Yaroslavl and Tula _ whose inhabitants are used to buying
many of their supplies in the capital. But they said they would try
to work out deals with regional leaders over the next two weeks.
   Residents of the greater Moscow region will still be able to buy
in the city's stores, as will veterans and invalids from elsewhere,
Popov said.
   Moscow's stores have been packed since Thursday with what
Stankevich called ``enormous lines of angry people.'' They were
trying to buy macaroni, cereals and salt, all usually among the few
readily available food products in the shortage-plagued Soviet
Union.
   Lines at some food stores Saturday evening were not longer than
usual, and shoppers interviewed at random said they were not buying
up extra goods _ although they clearly were dissatisfied with the
selection of what food was available.
   Popov said Moscow had received offers from Lithuania, Estonia
and the Crimea to supply it with food, but did not specify whether
it would circumvent the Kremlin's ministries and strike deals on
its own.
   Ryzhkov's economic plan proposes a five-year transition to what
it calls a market economy still partially regulated by the
government.
   It has drawn criticism from all sides. Lawmakers are angry over
its price increases and the expected unemployment it will bring,
while Western experts say it doesn't do enough to liquidate central
control and introduce a real market.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature is to continue discussing the
plan early next week, and a vote is not expected before Tuesday.

   Former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein
leads state Attorney General John Van de Kamp for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination but Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson would
beat both, a poll found.
   A Los Angeles Times survey, published Saturday, showed that 38
percent of registered voters favored Feinstein while 27 percent
wanted Van de Kamp. Thirty-five percent of respondents were still
undecided on a Democratic nominee in the June 5 primary.
   The Times polled 1,730 registered voters by telephone between
May 17 and May 23. The sample included 854 self-described
registered Democrats, 621 people who said they were registered
Republicans, 218 independents and 37 members of other parties.
   Neither top Democrat has picked up significant support since
late February, according to the poll.
   Feinstein jumped ahead of Van de Kamp that month with a
television commercial that featured her announcing the
assassination of San Francisco Mayor George Moscone.
   The number of undecided voters also has not changed since
February.
   Of those polled, 42 percent said they would vote for Wilson,
compared with 36 percent who said they preferred Feinstein. Another
21 percent were undecided and 1 percent would vote for someone else.
   In a Van de Kamp-Wilson matchup, 44 percent said they would vote
for Wilson and 36 percent for Van de Kamp. Twenty percent were
undecided.
   Feinstein supporters said her ``single most important quality''
is the belief that she ``can get things done,'' the poll said. Van
de Kamp's chief attraction for his supporters was his experience,
according to the survey.
   The Times said the poll's margin of error for all registered
voters was 3 percent. For Democrats and Republicans only, the
margin of error was 5 percent.

   President Bush said Saturday he will
try to convince Mikhail Gorbachev there is no threat to the Soviet
Union from a united Germany in NATO.
   However, Bush acknowledged it will be difficult to sell that
idea.
   ``I think it's going to take a while before we have agreement on
how a post-German unification Europe looks,'' Bush said.
   ``My job is to convince him that there is no threat to the
Soviet Union from a united Germany in NATO and, I'm absolutely
convinced there is no threat to him and I think it's stabilizing,''
Bush said.
   The president spoke briefly with reporters as he began a round
of golf at a local country club. Bush is relaxing here for four
days before meeting with the Soviet president in Washington.
   Gorbachev said Friday that if Germany is allowed to join NATO,
the Kremlin will refuse to pull out its troops and might retreat in
all negotiations to end the East-West confrontation in Europe.
   But Bush, asserting that a united Germany should be in NATO,
said, ``I think really I can make the case that it is in their
interest.''
   He acknowledged, however, ``They have a different position than
we do right now.''
   Bush, who arrived Friday at his oceanside estate, received a
morning briefing from Robert Gates, his deputy national security
adviser, on developments throughout the world but then moved on
quickly to recreation.
   The weather was perfect for a holiday weekend, with sunny skies
and warm temperatures.
   After a morning tennis game, Bush piloted his boat, Fidelity,
into the Atlantic Ocean. Swinging by the shore, he waved to
tourists. A group of children, camping on a beach, yelled in
unison, ``Hello, Mr. Bush.''
   Spending the weekend with Bush and his wife, Barbara, at his
Walker's Point compound were Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner and his wife, Honey; Houston friends Charles and Sally
Neblett; and Daphney Murray, director of the Institute of Museum
Services of Washington.
   Also staying with the Bushes are their son, Marvin, and his
wife, Margaret, and their two children; and their daughter, Dorothy
LeBlond, and her two children.
   As Bush relaxed, his senior advisers were getting ready to set
the stage for the summit by appearing Sunday on television talk
shows. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft were scheduled to appear on network TV
programs.
   Bush was interviewed in Washington on Thursday by a Soviet
television journalist for broadcast on Sunday.
   Gorbachev will return to Washington on Wednesday evening after
an overnight stop in Ottawa for talks with Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney.
   Bush and Gorbachev will begin their meetings Thursday at the
White House.
   After two days of talks in Washington, the two leaders will go
to Camp David on Saturday for more discussions. Their meeting will
conclude on Sunday with a morning news conference back at the White
House.

   Cashier Sofia Martikina waved her arms toward the
dozens of people jamming a nearby counter to buy sausage and lard.
   ``It's just outrageous!'' she said. ``They are sweeping up
everything. There is no salt or macaroni left.''
   At a bakery down the street, Nargiza Nargieva clutched a loaf of
brown bread as she spoke of the impending government plan to triple
the prices of bakery goods on July 1 and the crush of shoppers back
home in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia.
   ``It's been that way for about a week,'' she said of the run on
the stores in the Caucasus republic. ``In Georgia, we are very much
afraid of bread price increases. ... There is nothing left, neither
bread nor cheese.''
   Mrs. Nargieva, who on Saturday bought a dress imported from
Hungary before heading back to Tbilisi on Monday, seemed genuinely
surprised at new, temporary restrictions that would prevent
out-of-towners from buying goods in Moscow stores.
   ``We just can't believe that anything like that _ selling things
on passports _ can happen in the Soviet Union,'' she said. ``I
can't believe that. It's very bad.''
   In reality, some other regions in the country adopted
residents-only rules months ago. Moscow's planned restrictions are
being put into effect to curb panic-buying that city officials say
has been occurring in the capital since an economic reform plan was
announced Thursday.
   Another woman in the bakery who refused to give her name was
pleased with the rule in which residents of Moscow would have to
show their ``propiska'' _ a stamp in their internal passports _ to
shop at the city's stores.
   ``I'm a Muscovite and I think it's good,'' she said. ``There
will be fewer crowds in the shops and we will be able to buy
anything without a fuss.''
   But Mrs. Martikina, the cashier, wasn't so sure.
   ``I don't know how I will feel when a woman with a young child
comes up to me to buy milk and I have to refuse on the grounds she
has no propiska,'' Mrs. Martikina said. ``Does the fact that she's
not a Muscovite mean that she has to starve, she and her child?
It's just awful.''
   Shoppers interviewed at random on a drizzly Saturday evening
said they had not done any hoarding of goods themselves and had not
seen their neighbors buying extra.
   Alexandra Sergeyeva, standing in a slow-moving line along with
more than 60 other people to buy about 2 pounds of the grayish,
wrinkled sausages on sale, said she has not been stocking up on
food.
   ``I don't have any place to store it,'' she said, adding that if
she did have extra shelf space, she would be buying more goods.
   ``Well, anyway, I don't have that much money, but I could afford
another kilo,'' she said. The store was limiting shoppers to two
kilograms, almost 4{ pounds.
   ``Yes, I heard that prices will go up,'' Mrs. Sergeyeva said.
``You know, I don't think the country's economy is going to be
saved. For ordinary people it's going to be worse. It's not that
they will suffer that much, but they will be much poorer.''
   Further up the line, Svetlana Kireichnenkova, who has a husband
and two children, said the planned price increases are ``going to
adversely affect my family.''
   Mrs. Kireichnenkova described herself as an out-of-towner and
had heard about the new rules for Moscow shoppers, but did not want
to speculate about her future.
   ``I don't really feel up to making forecasts,'' she said. ``We
shall live and see.''

<HEAD>TV Station Admits Videotaping Illegal Pit-Bull Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives at a Denver television station have
defended their staff's videotaping of an illegal pit bull fight as
``legitimate news-gathering activities.''
   Roger Ogden, general manager of KCNC-TV, on Friday said station
employees attended such a fight in September, but they didn't
realize at the time that it was illegal.
   He also said the tape used in reporter Wendy Bergen's four-part
series on illegal pit bull fights came from a confidential source.
   ``We have been told, and we believe, that this video was not the
same fight attended by KCNC employees in September,'' the station
said in a statement.
   The station and police agencies began an investigation this
month after allegations were made by anonymous sources that KCNC
staged a fight between two dogs for Bergen's series. The sources
also told competing news organizations the station paid for the
fight.
   KCNC-TV denied the allegations, and Ogden ordered a
comprehensive investigation.
   Police said the fight featured in Bergen's report, which aired
April 30 through May 2, occurred on a grassy area near the South
Platte River in Sheridan, a Denver suburb.
   Staging a dogfight or even attending one is a felony in
Colorado, punishable by up to four years in prison and $1,000 fine.
   Police investigations into the incident were completed this
week. District attorneys in Arapahoe and Jefferson counties, where
the fights reportedly occurred, are looking into who might have
been involved.
   No charges have been filed against station employees or dog
owners. KCNC-TV News Director Marv Rockford said no disciplinary
action has been taken against any KCNC employee.
   In a statement released Friday, KCNC defended its actions.
   ``We believe the subject of pit bulls and pit bull fighting in
Colorado was and is a legitimate topic of public concern and
interest and is an appropriate journalistic subject,'' the unsigned
statement said.
   ``Last September, in the course of investigating the pit bull
issue, KCNC employees attended and videotaped a pit bull fight that
took place in Arapahoe County. Attendance and coverage of the fight
was in the normal course of the station's activity in gathering the
news and preparing the report. The station later learned of the
existence of a criminal statute relating to dogfighting.
   ``We then contacted and met with Robert Gallagher, the district
attorney for Arapahoe County, and members of his staff, to discuss
whether journalists attending and videotaping a pit bull fight for
the purpose of obtaining and reporting the news might be committing
a criminal act.
   ``While they indicated that it was their view that the statute
might apply even in that situation, KCNC did not and does not agree
with any interpretation of the statute that would make criminal
such legitimate news-gathering activities.''
   When the Arapahoe County district attorney's office learned of
KCNC's statement, it announced that a special prosecutor would be
appointed to review the case.
   But because of the holiday weekend, it will be at least Tuesday
before the court appoints a special prosecutor.

<HEAD>Arafat Asks U.S. to Pressure Israel to Move Ahead on Middle East
Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, apparently
sensing a cooling of relations between Washington and Jerusalem,
pleaded with the U.S. government Saturday to help along Middle East
peace by pressuring Israel.
   A U.N. Security Council emergency session on the latest violence
between Irsaelis and Arabs in the Israeli-occupied lands adjourned
and was to resume Tuesday in New York.
   An Arab diplomat said a council decision could be ``one week,
two weeks'' off.
   Arafat asked the 15-nation council during the two-day session
for sweeping U.N. moves to protect Arabs in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   At a news conference Saturday, Arafat criticized the United
States for shielding Israel from international pressure and for
vetoing critical Security Council resolutions.
   ``In view of Israeli dependence on U.S. aid, we are expecting
the U.S. administration and people to play a more effective role in
bringing about peace,'' the Palestine Liberation Organization chief
said through an interpreter.
   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud said the United States had
tried to launch the idea in Geneva of sending an international
fact-finding mission to the occupied territories, but backtracked
Saturday under Israeli pressure.
   ``The U.S. had been informally suggesting such a development and
in our view flip-flopped on its position,'' Maksoud told reporters.
``It means Israel still has a stranglehold on the decision-making
process.''
   The U.S. State Department earlier said it was prepared to
discuss having the Security Council send a temporary fact-finding
mission to the occupied lands.
   That put Washington publicly at odds with Israel, which said it
would bar any observer team.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering suggested a likely move would
be dispatching a personal representative of U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to look into the situation in the
territories. This has been done before.
   ``The direction in which we're looking is something that might
come from the secretary-general in that regard,'' Pickering said
after the meeting.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III raised the possibility
Friday when he said Washington would not oppose such a mission.
   Pickering did not speak in the council meeting.
   Arafat, in an unprecedented speech to the council Friday,
appealed for a U.N. emergency force to protect the 1.7 million
Arabs in the occupied lands, and he urged sanctions against Israel.
   A U.S. official made plain Saturday that Washington would veto
any council resolution containing those points. ``There are
obviously elements of the speech we don't agree with,'' the
official said on condition of anonymity.
   A U.N. emergency team would include representatives of several
countries rather than personal representatives of Perez de Cuellar
and would presumably mount a wider probe than a special envoy.
   The Security Council convened at Arab behest after an Israeli
gunman killed seven Arab workers on May 20, touching off a surge of
violence in the occupied territories that left at least 15 dead.
Israeli officials say the man was deranged.
   Palestinians have been waging an uprising, or intefadeh, for
nearly 30 months aimed at ending Israel's 23-year-old occupation of
the lands.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, 720 Palestinians have
been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians. An additional 216
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have died.
   The Security Council session was held in Geneva rather than New
York City to avoid a showdown over Arafat's visa. The United States
has refused him entry in the past.

   The State Department on Saturday warned that
Americans traveling in the Philippines face an increased risk of
terrorism as the two countries prepare for a new set of
negotiations on U.S. military bases in the island nation.
   ``During this period, Communist elements in the Philippines are
likely to expand their current terrorism campaign beyond U.S.
officials and active duty U.S. servicemen to include retired
personnel and the places they frequent,'' the department said in a
statement.
   American and Philippine negotiators are preparing to resume
talks on whether to renew a lease on Clark Air Base, Subic Bay
naval base and four smaller installations. The leases expire in
September 1991.
   Opposition to the bases is growing because many Filipinos view
them as an infringement on national sovereignty.
   The State Department said that ``most of the major tourist
destinations and most urban areas generally have not experienced
the type of civil disorder'' noted in its advisory.
   But it added: ``Because of criminal activities, travelers should
exercise caution at night in the downtown entertainment districts
of major cities and should avoid travel to remote mountainous
areas.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors Want Stuart's Attorney to Break Attorney-Client
Privilege</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors want the lawyer of Charles Stuart, who
apparently committed suicide after his wife's mysterious shooting
death, to break attorney-client privilege, two newspapers reported
Saturday.
   Suffolk County prosecutors are seeking to force lawyer John T.
Dawley to tell a grand jury what he knows of the events surrounding
the October shooting that left Carol Stuart and her prematurely
born son dead.
   Stuart, who also was shot, originally blamed the attack on a
black robber, and summoned police help with a dramatic call from
his car telephone.
   The request to order Dawley to testify came in a closed hearing
last month. Appeals Court Judge Edith Fine on Friday ordered the
court to release a condensed transcript of the hearing following an
appeal by the Boston Herald.
   Superior Court Judge James Donohue has asked the state's
appellate court to rule on the prosecutors' request, the Herald and
The Boston Globe reported Saturday.
   At the closed hearing, Assistant District Attorney Thomas Mundy
argued that shortly before Stuart apparently jumped to his death
off a bridge five months ago, he told Dawley of his plot to kill
his wife.
   Mundy said Stuart's brother, Matthew, was a potential target of
the grand jury's investigation, and indicated that Dawley's
testimony could shed light on Matthew Stuart's possible role in the
killings.
   ``The inferences point that he may well have told Dawley exactly
what occurred, and that information may be very important to the
grand jury's determination as to what inference they wish to draw
from Matthew Stuart's purported statements to several witnesses in
determining what charges to bring,'' Mundy said in his argument
before Donohue.
   Matthew Stuart told police he thought he was involved in an
insurance scam when he drove to the city's Mission Hill section to
meet his brother shortly after the shooting.
   Matthew Stuart allegedly disposed of the gun police believe was
used in the shooting, as well as other items he said he believed
would later be reported stolen.
   He also said he did not recognize Mrs. Stuart in his brother's
car, but mistook her body for a duffle bag or laundry bag.
   Mundy said he believed ``the interest of the grand jury in
resolving this very serious crime, I would submit in the interest
of justice, overrides the privilege'' protecting client-lawyer
communications.
   Nancy Gertner, a lawyer for Matthew Stuart, argued at the
hearing that no Massachusetts case law gives precedent for
overriding the attorney-client privilege in the interest of justice.
   ``And in addition, the kind of evidence, even if Mr. Dawley were
permitted to testify, would not be admissible in a proceeding
likely to come out of this,'' Gertner said.

<HEAD>Rival Christian Forces Agree to Truce in Lebanon, Vatrican Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Vatican envoy said Saturday that rival
Christian leaders agreed to end their 4-month-old war that has left
more than 1,000 people dead, but new sniping reportedly claimed
three lives.
   In south Lebanon, Palestinian guerrillas ambushed a convoy of
Israeli-backed militiamen, inflicting an undisclosed number of
casualties and losing four of their men, Lebanese security sources
reported. An Israeli spokesman said no militiamen were killed.
   In Lebanon's other factional power struggle, Syrian troops
intervened early Saturday to halt 15 hours of street battles in
west and south Beirut between rival Shiite Moslem factions. That
fighting reportedly left five people dead and 42 wounded.
   Vatican ambassador Pablo Puente told a news conference that
Christian Gen. Michel Aoun and fellow Christian Samir Geagea, a
militia chieftain, had agreed that a 9-day-old cease-fire ``will
become a permanent truce.'' Puente said the rival leaders made the
pledges separately to him and also vowed to release all prisoners.
   Neither leader provided immediate confirmation.
   They have been fighting for control of Lebanon's Christian
enclave, which comprises east Beirut and nearby coastal communities.
   Despite Puente's announcement, police said Aoun's troops and
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militiamen exchanged intermittent sniper
fire in east Beirut, killing three people and wounding one.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to 1,035 killed and 2,770
wounded since the power struggle broke out Jan. 30.
   Independent observers doubt the power struggle will end until
Aoun and Geagea work out a political settlement and somehow
overcome their deep-seated hatred of each other.
   Aoun controls 19,000 troops. Geagea's militia includes 6,000
core fighters who are backed by about 30,000 reservists.
   Before agreeing to the cease-fire May 17, the two forces had
fought each other to a standstill.
   Geagea has accused Aoun of trying to destroy his militia. The
general charges Geagea with ``plotting against the Christians'
interest'' by trying to enforce a peace accord brokered by Arab
nations to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war between Christians
and Moslems.
   The accord, endorsed by Lebanon's parliament in Saudi Arabia in
October, gives Moslems equal power with the traditionally dominant
Christians.
   Aoun rejects that accord, complaining it does not guarantee the
withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon. They have been
deployed since 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate, and
they now control most of Lebanon's territory.
   In the south Lebanon fighting, the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine said in a series of statements from Beirut
that its fighters carried out Saturday's attack to avenge the
massacre of seven Palestinian workers by an Israeli gunman near Tel
Aviv on May 20.
   Lebanese security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said a guerrilla force detonated three remote-control bombs on a
road inside Israel's self-designated security zone north of the
border with the Jewish state as the mostly Christian South Lebanon
Army convoy passed. The SLA works in concert with Israeli forces.
   But an Israeli Army spokesman in Tel Aviv said there were no SLA
casualties but reported that the militiamen killed four guerrillas.
He made no mention of bombs.
   The Israeli version indicated that an SLA patrol intercepted an
infiltration attempt, not that the militiamen were ambushed.
   However, a Lebanese source said the SLA convoy of two armored
personnel carriers and two jeeps was hit near Shebaa in the eastern
sector of the Israeli zone.
   In the Moslem power struggle, police said the situation remained
``very tense'' after Syrian troops moved in to stop the Beirut
fighting. Authorities said the mainstream Syrian-backed Amal
movement and the fundamentalist pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, were keeping their fighters on alert.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been battling sporadically for 2{ years
for control of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest
sect. At least 1,049 people have been killed and 3,136 wounded
during that time.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Looks to Narrow Differences With Bush Over Germany</HEAD>
<NOTE>For Release at 8 p.m. EDT - time set by source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev says the question of
whether a unified Germany should belong to NATO is certain to
produce a major disagreement in his coming summit with President
Bush, but ``I do expect the differences to be narrowed,'' Time
magazine reports.
   ``I hope the character of the relationship I've developed with
the president will permit us to move forward rather than backward
in our discussions,'' Gorbachev said in an interview with the
magazine Tuesday at his office in Moscow. The transcript of the
session appears in the June 4 edition of the magazine.
   On Friday, Gorbachev told a press conference that the Soviet
Union will keep hundreds of thousands of troops in eastern Germany
and will review its approach to European arms-control talks if a
united Germany joins NATO. The U.S. and West German governments
have insisted that membership in the alliance is imperative.
   President Bush, meanwhile, told reporters Saturday he will try
to convince Gorbachev the Soviet Union would not be threatened by a
united Germany in NATO.
   ``I think it's going to take a while before we have agreement on
how a post-German unification Europe looks,'' Bush said. ``My job
is to convince him that there is no threat to the Soviet Union from
a united Germany in NATO and, I'm absolutely convinced there is no
threat to him and I think it's stabilizing.''
   In the session with Time, Gorbachev said that ``Politically, we
are already entering a new phase that should be characterized by
the establishment of permanent security structures, instead of NATO
and the Warsaw Treaty Organization.
   ``I envision Europe as a union of states with common
institutions to assure military and environmental security, along
with cooperation in science and culture,'' the Soviet president
said. ``Each state would retain its local and national character
and have the right to protect is special interests without
prejudice to others.
   ``You ask how my approach differs from that of President Bush.
Indeed, there are some differences. According to the American
scenario, as far as I can tell, NATO _ and that means a NATO
strengthened by the inclusion of a unified Germany _ should be the
foreman and guarantor in the building of a new European order,''
Gorbachev said.
   ``I can understand that Americans and many Europeans have their
own perception of this organization,'' he went on. ``They give it
credit for keeping peace throughout the cold war. On that basis, we
are being told the role of NATO, in the new phase as well, will be
entirely positive, and will even serve the interests of the Soviet
Union. But that's just not serious. For our people, too, NATO is
associated with the cold war _ but as an organization designed from
the start to be hostile to the Soviet Union, as a force that
whipped up the arms race and the danger of war.
   ``Regardless of what is being said about NATO now, for us it is
a symbol of the past, a dangerous and confrontational past. And we
will never agree to assign it the leading role in building a new
Europe. I want us to be understood correctly on this.''
   Gorbachev, at another point, was asked whether he expected the
issue to lead to a ``major disagreement'' at the summit his coming
week. ``I wouldn't say I expect a major disagreement _ I'll state
for a fact that there will be one,'' he replied. ``But I do expect
the differences to be narrowed as a result of my discussions with
President Bush.''
   On other topics, Gorbachev:
   _Conceded his domestic economic reforms are likely to trigger
serious inflation and unemployment as the nation moves toward a
market economy. ``You have to bear in mind that we have quite a few
factories ... that are simply inefficient,'' he said. ``They're
going to have to reorient their production. People will have to be
retrained. Many will have to find new occupations.
   _Said ``it would be an environmental catastrophe'' if other
nations, including his own, tried to achieve the standard of living
enjoyed by Americans. ``America already consumes a disproportionate
percentage of the world's energy resources,'' he said. ``That's why
I stress the conflict between consumer society and nature.''
   _Defended his tough stance against the independence moves of the
Baltic states, saying ``as president, I took an oath of office to
uphold the constitution ... We are looking for a way to restore
constitutional order and authority, and to do so by political
means. Let me just stop there, particularly because recently we've
seen some new and encouraging signs.''
   _Said a return to the cold war is ``hardly possible now''
because ``We have learned too much about each other to be able to
revert to old preconceptions and ideological cliches.''

   Thirty-one people were killed and
hundreds of thousands left homeless by last weekend's earthquake
and strong aftershocks in southern Sudan, government and rebel
officials said Saturday.
   Thirty people were killed at Kuon-Wei near the city of Bor, 669
miles south of Khartoum, said the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation
Association in Nairobi, Kenya. The association is the relief arm of
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   It said the May 20 quake sent homes tumbling into the River Nile.
   A spokesman for the rebel relief group, James Nduku, said
another person was killed and two buildings collapsed in the
village of Lafan near Torit, 790 miles south of Khartoum.
   Because of the remoteness of the area, reports about the effects
of the earthquake have trickled in slowly.
   The quake measured 7.4 on the Richter scale, capable of causing
widespread damage in a populated area. But much of southern Sudan's
population has been displaced by famine and the country's
7-year-old civil war.
   Brig. Dominique Kasiano, a member of Sudan's ruling junta and
political supervisor of the southern Equatoria region, said every
government building and many homes were destroyed in Terakeka, a
Nile River garrison town 55 miles north of southern Sudan's main
city, Juba.
   He appealed for international help for quake victims.
   The government said about 300,000 people were left homeless.
   Officials of Western relief agencies and the rebel relief group
said they had no knowledge of the situation in Terakeka, but
questioned government figures on the number of people left homeless.
   In Cairo, the head of Egypt's monitoring service said the unit's
seismographs have recorded almost continuous aftershocks since
Thursday, when a strong aftershock struck. Monitoring stations
measured it at 7.1 on the Richter scale.
   A number of houses and buildings have been reported damaged in
Juba, 750 miles south of Khartoum, whose population has been
swelled by refugees. No injuries have been reported in Juba,
however.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.1 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.1.

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's Communist Party on
Saturday called for nationwide multiparty elections and formally
renounced its monopoly on political power at a national congress.
   But the congress was boycotted by Communist Party members from
three of Yugoslavia's six constituent republics, and analysts said
it is doubtful the latest moves by the party will help restore its
sagging national power.
   In a rare commentary, the leading Macedonian daily Nova
Makedonija said Saturday's session represents ``the definite end''
of the Communist party of Yugoslavia since only three of the six
republics took part in the session.
   Delegates from Slovenia, Croatia, and Macedonia refused to join
in the resumption of the 14th Communist Party congress that broke
up in disarray at its last meeting in January.
   Communists suffered resounding defeats in recent local
multiparty elections in Slovenia and Croatia, the first free
elections in Yugoslavia in 50 years.
   Delegates from the three republics that boycotted the meeting
claimed the resumed congress was organized by hard-liners intent on
maintaining their leading role at a time when parts of the country
are already moving toward democracy.
   The January congress was suspended when Slovenia's delegates
left the hall after losing a vote on reforms to hard-liners.
   Participating in Saturday's gathering were Communists from
Serbia, the largest republic, Montenegro and Bosnia-Hercegovina.
   Delegates at the three-hour session adopted a statement waiving
the party's leading role in society and called for free national
elections.
   ``The most important thing is that the party be radically
reformed ... into a modern political party,'' said Communist Party
acting president Miomir Grbovic in his opening speech.
   Yugoslavia's Communist Party continues to rule at the federal
level, but its power has been crippled since center-right parties
won elections in Slovenia and Croatia.
   Multiparty elections are also planned in Bosnia-Hercegovina and
Macedonia.
   Many political analysts doubt the Communist party can restore
the authority it has lost after over a decade of ethnic and
political squabbles and economic mismanagement.
   Saturday's session decided that a ``Congress of Democratic
Renewal'' will be held on September 29 and the Communist Party will
take part in future free elections at the federal level.
   The adopted document said the ``radically renewed party'' will
try to unite all leftist political groups within Yugoslavia.
   ``The party still enjoys the support of the working class and
will continue to rely on it in the future,'' Grbovic said. But he
admitted the party's reputation ``has drastically declined
throughout Yugoslavia.''
   Nijaz Durakovic, head of the party in Bosnia-Hercegovina, told
the gathering the Communists ``must show the right-wing parties
that we are able to unite and function successfully in a multiparty
environment.''
   Serbian Communists are still firmly entrenched in their
republic. Serbia is the only one of Yugoslavia's six states that
has failed to schedule multiparty elections.

   ``A white, 1955 T-Bird pulls on Main Street in front of

   Shiverdecker has been unable to determine who the

   The counties are Crawford, Plymouth and Woodbury. The White

low-interest loans for businesses and individuals.
   The announcement was made here, where Bush is spending four days
at his oceanside home.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, a self-described
``racing buff,'' hoofed the soggy three miles of the Indianapolis
500 Festival parade with his wife and three children Saturday.
   Quayle, wife Marilyn and children Tucker, Benjamin and Corinne
were whisked into a building to wait out a 30-minute downpour
before the festivities began.
   But the weather at least stayed dry during the 2{-hour parade.
   ``I can't believe he's walking,'' said Janie Charles, who waited
to ride an old-fashioned bicycle in the parade as Quayle bodyguards
tucked umbrellas into an escort car.
   Quayle, the first sitting vice president to serve as parade
grand marshal, said the role was unquestionably in character for
him.
   ``I've been to the race close to 20 times, that's about half the
years of my life,'' the 43-year-old vice president said.
   The Quayles were joined by several celebrities and the race's 33
drivers, who rode in open convertibles over the sopping wet
black-and-white checked carpet near the reviewing stand.
   Bands from as far away as South Dakota and Texas marched and
played, while gigantic balloons of Raggedy Ann and Popeye floated
high above the soggy crowd.
   Gov. Evan Bayh and Indianapolis Mayor William H. Hudnut also
took part in the parade, as did Showtime comedian Jeff Altman and
actor Norman Fell.
   Quayle, a former senator from Indiana, said getting to the race
this year would be a lot more convenient than when he lived in his
hometown of Huntington or was in law school in Indianapolis.
   ``We're going to fly over traffic this year,'' he said.
   ``But there was something that was fun _ to get ... to the track
by some sort of back road,'' he added.
   ``We'd usually get about a half a mile from the race track. It
was a little bit of a challenge to do that hauling the picnic
basket.''
   Quayle attended last year's race as a spectator.
   Organizers of Saturday's nationally televised parade said the
rain kept attendance down to less than 100,000.
   ``We usually don't get to see any of the parade,'' said Tim
O'Connor, a hot dog vendor and seven-year parade regular who's
usually too busy selling. ``We'd usually be out of pop by now, but
we can't give it away,'' he said.
   As of late Saturday afternoon, the forecast for Sunday's race
included clouds _ and a 30 percent chance of rain. The start was
set for noon EDT.

   George Bush's second get-together with Mikhail
S. Gorbachev shapes up as a summit of lowered expectations.
   There will be no treaty signed to limit long-range nuclear
missiles, no announcement of a dramatic increase in trade between
the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Other differences also will be felt: Moscow's resistance to
German unity, its pressure on rebellious Lithuania to rejoin the
Soviet fold, and the slow pace of talks to call home hundreds of
thousands of troops and tanks from Europe.
   An agreement will be signed to destroy chemical weapons and a
statement will be issued announcing limits on cruise missiles, an
important step toward a broader treaty cutting the deadliest
weapons in the superpowers' arsenals.
   But much of the three days of talks will be given over to
discussing issues on which the superpowers are at loggerheads.
   ``We've got a lot of things to discuss that might not result in
a signed agreement,'' Bush said last week, adding, ``There's
enormous problems that just need to be talked about.''
   Yet, he told reporters, ``I don't want to have two ships pass in
the night, the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Recognizing the two leaders' fondness for springing surprises,
many experts believe that something unexpected will emerge from the
summit _ but probably nothing earthshaking.
   ``They are almost compelled to pull one or two rabbits out of
the hat but they're going to be fairly small rabbits,'' predicted
Robert W. Tucker, a Soviet specialist at the Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies.
   ``The administration always `low balls' summits,'' said Robert
Hunter, a Soviet expert at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. ``It's the New Hampshire primary syndrome.''
   Possible steps toward progress include further compromises for a
pact covering long-range nuclear missiles, where differences
already have been narrowed significantly, or pledges to revive
slowly moving negotiations on a treaty to slash the superpowers'
European armies and stores of conventional arms.
   Tucker said the real importance of the summit is that it
continues the string of superpower meetings.
   ``It's part of the long and complicated and arduous process of
winding down the Cold War and the differences that remain between
us,'' Tucker said.
   Aside from striving for progress in arms talks, Bush will press
Gorbachev to allow a united Germany to be a part of the U.S.-led
NATO alliance.
   ``At stake,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker III, ``is
the reconciliation of a people and of a continent too long divided
and the future of a legitimate and stable European order.''
   Yet, Moscow has refused _ at least publicly _ to budge from its
opposition to a united Germany in NATO, fearing a shift in the
balance of power in Europe.
   Bush will press Gorbachev on the pace of negotiations in Vienna
aimed at reducing the U.S. and Soviet forces and conventional arms
in Europe.
   As the president said Thursday, ``The talks haven't gone as far
or as fast as I would like to see. ... Maybe we can find some way
at the summit ... to move CFE (the talks) forward.''
   The Bush administration feels Moscow has slowed the pace of the
discussions on a Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, in part,
because it wants the large West German army scaled back.
   On this issue, there may be signs of movement.
   Last week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
Moscow ``advocates an acceleration in the Vienna negotiations.'' He
rejected the notion that Moscow's concerns over the West German
army have made his government hesitant to sign a CFE agreement.
   Moreover, West German officials who met with Shevardnadze say
they think the U.S. assessment of Soviet concerns may be a
misunderstanding.
   Lithuania also promises, in Bush's words, to put ``some tension
on the summit.''
   Baker said recently that ``a good bit'' of the president's time
will be spent discussing the moves by Baltic states to become
independent of the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's pressure to keep
them in the fold.
   Gorbachev, facing tests of his power at an important Communist
Party Congress in July, likely will be unwilling to give up too
much to Bush, experts say.
   ``Gorbachev's playing a very weak hand but he's playing it so
well he's made himself look like an equal,'' said Hunter.
   ``His objective is not to humiliate the president but to be seen
as a member of `The Club.' It's Bush's interest to be as
forthcoming with Gorbachev as he can, while Gorbachev is doing what
we want him to do,'' Hunter said. ``They have a mutual interest in
success at this summit.''
   Gorbachev is interested in any help Bush can offer for the
battered Soviet economy. But that help, at least for now, won't
include the trade concessions that once had been expected from the
Bush administration.
   The United States will not grant the Soviet Union preferential,
most-favored-nation status because the Soviet legislature has not
passed legislation guaranteeing the right of emigration.
   U.S. law prohibits the president from granting such concessions
to any nation determined to be denying its citizens the right to
leave.
   On the other hand, Bush recently loosened restrictions on sales
to Moscow of high-tech products such as computers and precision
milling equipment.
   The two presidents also will discuss the unfulfilled efforts to
sign a treaty limiting strategic arms.
   While Bush and Gorbachev will declare their intention to reduce
the numbers of their long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and
submarines by one-third, the formal agreement they once had hoped
to sign is not even close to being ready.
   Gorbachev arrives in Washington Wednesday evening as a leader
enjoying widespread popularity on the international stage but
strapped by immense problems at home.
   His economy is wrecked. His nation is torn by nationalist
uprisings. His far-flung communist empire virtually is gone.
   By contrast, Bush remains high in the public opinion polls and
deals from a position of strength even though he is wrestling with
difficult deficit problems.
   Yet, Bush does not want to undermine Gorbachev or push him from
power because he has been the champion of Soviet reforms and
allowed Eastern Europe to break free from Moscow.
   Despite his problems, Gorbachev appears in control.
   ``Whether we like what he is doing, whether we are unhappy with
what he is doing, the buck in the Soviet government today stops
with him,'' said Dimitri K. Simes, a Soviet expert at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.
   Beginning Thursday, Bush and Gorbachev will hold two days of
talks at the White House. On Saturday, they will retreat to the
privacy of Camp David for a day of discussions on troublesome
political issues.
   It is at the presidential retreat, Bush said last week, that he
expects he and Gorbachev ``can sit and talk'' about relations
between the two superpowers.
   The summit will end Sunday morning, when the two leaders hold a
wrap-up news conference in the chandeliered East Room of the White
House.
   The planned showpiece of the summit will be the signing Friday
evening of the agreements to destroy chemical weapons and clamp
long-sought limits on air- and sea-launched cruise missiles.

<HEAD>Talks Break Off in Polish Transport Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking railworkers and government
representatives broke off talks Saturday after failing to settle a
walkout that has crippled transportation nationwide.
   The strike over a wage dispute has tested the resolve of the
government reformers, who have imposed a strict program to shock
the economy back to life. The government has flatly rejected pay
increases as an inflationary threat to the economic overhaul plan
imposed on Jan. 1.
   ``I am willing to talk with everybody ... about everything
except wages,'' said Labor Minister Jacek Kuron of the
Solidarity-led government. ``There will be no change of the
government's stand.''
   Strike committee member Janusz Zaborowski said his negotiating
team would return to its headquarters in the northwest city of
Slupsk to decide on its next move.
   ``We came to Warsaw in good faith and our outstretched arm was
rejected yet again,'' Zaborowski said. ``The only constructive
effect of the talks was that both sides agreed the strikes are over
purely economic issues'' and not politics.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki reiterated Friday that despite
sympathy for the sufferings of Poles under the economic reforms, he
would not give to the strikers' demands.
   Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity trade union, said the
workers' grievences were real but said a strike was not the
appropriate answer.
   The strikes began May 20 and quickly spread across northwest
Poland.
   But the protest eased slightly Saturday when strikers at Gdansk
harbor and in at least one other area agreed to allow limited
passenger service as ``good will gestures.''
   The first signs of progress came Friday night when 42 hunger
strikers, six of them hospitalized, suspended their fast and three
rail stations in north-central Poland were reopened pending the
outcome of negotiations.
   But rail traffic to the Baltic coast remained closed on Saturday
and the country's busiest port, Szczecin, was paralyzed. The
Transport Ministry said 72 passenger trains had been canceled
Saturday morning.
   Freight traffic to the ports from Poland's industrial south and
Hungary and Czechoslovakia were also disrupted.
   The army was called in to move essential freight, but Transport
Minister Adam Wieladek said Saturday the military would not be used
to run the railroad. He said there were plans to replace major rail
routes with bus and truck transport.
   Officials say ``thousands'' of the nation's 400,000 railroad
workers were striking but gave no specific figures.
   The government's economic reforms cut off huge government
subsidies that allowed state-run industries, including the
railroad, to charge unrealistically low rates. The government has
demanding that pay increases come from funds within the enterprise
and have refused to make any exceptions.
   Strict wage controls coupled with a raise in prices to market
levels has reduced real income by an estimated 40 percent.
   Strikers are demanding a raise in rail workers' pay to 110
percent of the average national wage of $79 as month and have asked
for the dismissal of railroad directors installed under the former
Communist regime.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. tour of Verdi's opera
``Aida'' that would have included a five-story Sphinx and about
1,200 performers was canceled because producers felt they'd lose
too much money, an official said Saturday.
   ``The bottom line was red ink. The costs were getting too high
and the producers felt income would not cover expenses,'' said Tony
Attanasio, marketing director for the International Opera Festival.
   The show was scheduled to begin with performances June 1 and 2
at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, across the Hudson River from
New York City, and 30,000 tickets had been sold, Attanasio said.
   It had been scheduled to move to Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   The Montreal-based festival usually produces its own shows but
had contracted with Concert Production International to run the
show, Attanasio said in a telephone interview from New York.
   He said the company had a proven record of success with rock
tours by the Rolling Stones and David Bowie.
   ``They were trying to put on a good show,'' Attanasio said.
``Most of the trucks with the props had arrived in New York from
Toronto and work on building the stage and set was supposed to
start Monday ... they were just overwhelmed by the size of this
production.''
   The production was to include a stage the length of a football
field, the five-story replica of the Sphinx _ the Egyptian statue
of a lion with the head of a man _ and about 1,200 performers,
Attanasio said.
   The show was first performed in Giza, Egypt, in 1987. Since
then, the production has been staged around the world and seen by
about 850,000 people.
   Concert Production International decided to cancel Friday in a
decision that surprised festival officials, he said.
   A man answering the phone Saturday at Concert Production
International headquarters in Toronto referred all questions to
marketing director Joe Owens, but said Owens would not be reachable
until Monday.
   The cancellation cost the production companies a combined $2.5
million, Attanasio said.
   He said the festival was planning to resume the show in Europe
next summer.
   ``We have to go back to our old way of doing production _
produce it ourselves and do it one show at a time,'' he said.

   Cambodia's four warring factions
signed a truce and agreed to form a body to enforce it, but one
rebel leader said Saturday that the accord would accomplish little.
   If successful, the truce would end the 11-year-old civil war
between the Vietnam-backed government in Phnom Penh and a
three-party guerrilla coalition.
   However, guerrilla and diplomatic sources say they expect
renewed fighting prior to peace talks in Tokyo as the guerrillas
try to gain new ground and strengthen their bargaining positions.
   The truce will go into effect when it is announced officially at
the Cambodian peace talks scheduled in Tokyo June 4-5, said senior
guerrilla sources who spoke on condition of anonymity Saturday. The
parties also will announce that peace talks will be resumed in
Paris in July, they said.
   The guerrilla sources said the parties also agreed to the
formation of a Supreme National Council that would include
representatives from each faction and oversee the truce.
   The rebels include the Communist Khmer Rouge, the non-Communist
Khmer People's National Liberation Front, and a faction loyal to
coalition leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   One guerrilla spokesman, Ok Serei Sopheak of the National
Liberation Front, said Saturday a truce would not end the fighting.
   ``It is only a document,'' he said. ``It is a play on words.
There will be no cease-fire on the ground.''
   Another National Liberation Front, Ieng Moly, described the
reported agreement as only ``a voluntary self-restraint on the use
of force. There is no control, no supervision.''
   The National Liberation Front launched major attacks Friday
against the government-held town of Svay Chek in northwestern
Cambodia. Guerrillas said that 4,000 fighters were involved in the
push.
   ``We believe that an effective cease-fire must be controlled by
the United Nations,'' Ok Serei Sopheak said. ``Otherwise the
fighting will continue. We see a cease-fire as an element of a
larger solution. We won't get anything at all through a cease-fire
alone.''
   Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, a key mediator in the
conflict, had said last week that the pact would be signed. The
guerrilla sources said the agreement had been initialed by Thai
Defense Minister Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh.
   The Khmer Rouge is accused of killing a million Cambodians when
it ruled Cambodia for 3{ years during the 1970s. Vietnam invaded,
drove the Khmer from power and installed another government.
   The current government objects to any participation in a future
government by the Khmer Rouge, but China _ which supplies the
guerrilla faction _ says it must be a part of any peace settlement.

   A Korean Air Boeing 747 shut down one of its
four engines when flames shot out on takeoff Saturday, and the jet
returned to Los Angeles International Airport after dumping fuel,
officials said.
   Flight 17 to Seoul, South Korea, returned safely with its 384
passengers, said S.K. Park, the airline's local passenger services
manager.
   He knew only that the engine was not working, but had no details.
   The flames were observed by people on the ground as the jet took
off about 12:50 p.m., said Art Morrison, a Federal Aviation
Administration duty officer.
   The No. 1 engine, the outside engine on the left wing, was shut
down and the plane circled over the ocean to dump fuel. It landed
about 2:10 p.m.
   About 20 people in seaside El Segundo, just south of one end of
the airport's runways, saw flames and smoke coming from the 747,
said police Lt. David Cummings.
   ``People saw flames as the plane flew over the ocean and then
the flames stopped,'' Cummings said. ``They commented that it was
flying slow and lower than normal.''

   A memorial was dedicated Saturday at the former
site of Camp Douglas, once a training camp for Union soldiers _
many of them blacks _ and later a prison where thousands of
Confederate soldiers died.
   More than a century later, just six miles from the glitzy
boutiques and department stores along Chicago's Magnificent Mile,
no trace remains of the camp.
   The Heritage Memorial Wall honors the 6,000 Confederates who
died in the prison camp of malnutrition, disease and exposure, and
the thousands of Union soldiers who enlisted at the training camp,
said Ernest A. Griffin, who financed the $20,000 monument.
   Many soldiers from Camp Douglas are buried in mass graves at Oak
Woods Cemetery five miles away.
   Griffin said Camp Douglas was the Union's main training site for
black soldiers, almost 200,000 of whom served in the Union army in
a separate federal branch designated as the U.S. Colored Troops.
   For Griffin, the 6-by-6-foot concrete memorial mostly represents
his ``admiration for a grandfather who participated in a historic
event.''
   The grandfather was Pvt. Charles H. Griffin, a Civil War veteran
who served in the 29th Regiment's Company B of the U.S. Colored
Infantry.
   Ernest Griffin was born on what was once the camp site in 1912
and now is director of Grifin Funeral Home Ltd., which occupies
part of the tract.
   ``My grandfather enlisted for his Civil War service at this
precise spot where I have my funeral establishment,'' Griffin said
in a telephone interview Friday.
   About 300 people, including Mayor Richard M. Daley, joined a
motorcade and parade Saturday from Oak Woods Cemetery to the
memorial, which features a fountain, Confederate and Union flags,
other war memorabilia and the flags of each state that fought in
the Civil War.
   Daley presented Charles Griffin's great-great-great
granddaughter, 14-year-old Suzanne Griffin, with a Civil War flag.
   ``After 125 years, all wounds between the North and the South
should have been healed,'' said Ted Saunders, chairman of the
Veterans Task Force Inc. in Illinois, organizers of the dedication
ceremony. ``Over the years we have become one nation and one group
of people.''
   Saunders said he hopes the wall's dedication can help bring
blacks and whites closer together.
   ``Every Memorial Day, I think all of our soldiers, black and
white, realize how close we are to each other,'' Saunders said.
   Race is meaningless when soldiers are hiding in a fox hole, said
Saunders, a Vietnam War veteran.
   ``The man who was sitting next to me _ I didn't care whether he
was black or white. I wanted to be sure he'd cover my back, and I'd
cover his. You don't have division in that type of situation.''

<HEAD>Tradition Vs. Progress As Girls Clubs Change Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The members are often young girls who still
play with dolls and know their dreams will come true. But the
adults that run the Girls Clubs of America see the harsher
realities the girls face.
   They see a tight economy, expensive housing, cheap drugs and
other tough tests ahead for their 250,000 young participants, more
than half of whom are members of minorities and come from poor,
single-parent urban homes.
   In the face of those challenges, the Girls Clubs has changed its
name to Girls Inc., and adopted a new slogan, ``Growing up is
serious business.''
   These days, the 45-year-old, 120-affiliate national network
balances lessons in baking pies with lessons in selling them.
   ``The theme ... is to turn these girls into autonomous,
independent adults so they don't get stuck in some awful cycle
without any hope,'' said Keven Bellows, who works for the New
York-based national organization and directed the search for a new
name.
   She said the new name underscores the group's mission by
``moving away from the word `club,' which suggests exclusivity and
recreation.''
   It also should clarify the distinction between the organization
and the increasingly coed Boys Clubs and Girls Inc., Bellows said.
   However, several of the oldest Girls Clubs, like the one founded
here 28 years before the national organization was chartered in
1945, object to what they say is leaving a tradition behind.
   ``This club played a very important role in the whole
integration of women into society,'' said Nancy Achin Sullivan,
executive director of the Girls Club of Lowell, about 20 miles
north of Boston. ``We are very committed to its history.''
   Through the decades, professional staff members here have helped
thousands of girls, from Yankees looking for a diversion during
World War I to the Hispanic and Cambodian immigrant girls who
dropped in last week.
   Its 600 members, ranging in age from 6 to 14, visit the white
clapboard club daily to learn about computers, banking, science,
cooking and other practical skills. They also learn how to avoid
unwanted pregnancy, drug addiction and welfare.
   ``We've built a lot of equity in our name here,'' said Sullivan.
   She and other officials worry the club's historic stature will
be compromised and reliable donors, who account for at least half
the Lowell club's annual $250,000 budget, will be put off by the
name change.
   ``People will begin wondering what else has changed,'' Sullivan
said.
   Other clubs, like the nation's oldest in Stamford, Conn., have
lodged similar objections.
   But Bellows said the change was practical and inevitable.
   ``Nostalgia had to go by the wayside here in favor of
survival,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``Keeping the
traditional name was a kind of frivolous luxury we didn't have.''
   The issue arose two years ago during a Girls Clubs' lawsuit
against the Boys Clubs of America Inc., which had decided to change
its name to Boys and Girls Clubs of America Inc. to reflect its
growing coed membership.
   The case was eventually settled out of court when the Girls
Clubs agreed to accept $760,000 and withdraw its objections.
   But Girls Clubs' officials still worried the public would assume
the two organizations had merged. The name change was approved by
the national body at its annual meeting and made official in May.
   The old motto _ ``It doesn't matter where a girl comes from as
long as she knows where she is going'' _ also was changed to the
more sobering ``Growing up is serious business.''
   Girls Inc. has hired a public relations firm and plans a
national TV, print and radio campaign this summer trumpeting its
educational programs.
   But in Lowell, Sullivan said the club's reputation needs no
enhancement.
   ``We are steeped in tradition and don't need a new identity,''
said Sullivan. ``I have a problem with the assumption that a
national group ... knows what's best for this community.''
   Clubs have until 1992 to decide whether to go along with the new
name, slogan and image.
   Any that decides not to could become a non-voting affiliate of
the national organization.
   ``Either way, the kids don't really care,'' said Mary Kajanka,
president of the Lowell club's board of trustees. ``All they care
about is having some place to go and someone to care for them.''

<HEAD>More Than 150 McDonnell Douglas Workers Fired for Misuse of
Company Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. fired more
than 150 employees who allegedly used interest-free company loans
intended for personal computers to buy stereos or big-screen
televisions or simply for extra cash.
   The workers received loans of up to $4,000 each under the
company's loan program but never bought computers, company
spokesman Don Hanson said Friday.
   A data processing employee reportedly processed the loans by
printing phony invoices for computer sales, then took a $1,000
kickback. Loan applicants would then pay back the loan in
interest-free paycheck deductions.
   Some workers at the Long Beach plant used the money to buy
big-screen televisions and stereo systems, the Long Beach
Press-Telegram reported.
   In another scheme, employees would buy a $4,000 computer, submit
the invoice for a loan, then sell the computer back to the retailer.
   ``The reason for the program is to help our people acquire
equipment that would improve or assure their computer literacy and
to assure what they got at home would be compatible with what they
were working on at the plant,'' Hanson said.
   The program began in 1984 to allow people to shop for the best
computer bargain and get the loan for the amount of the sale,
Hanson said. Some 5,000 employees have taken advantage of the
program.
   Hanson said the fraud was discovered in April when an unusually
large number of applications were received for the maximum amount.
   No charges were filed in the case.

   The youngest son of executed dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu insisted Saturday he never ordered the army and
police to shoot at demonstrators during the bloody revolution that
toppled his father.
   Nicu Ceausescu, 39, appearing frail and tense, was flanked by
two helmeted policemen as he testified on the first day of his
nationally televised trial.
   ``I kept asking the security forces not to shoot at
demonstrators,'' he said. He told the five-judge military court
that the evidence did not support the chief charge against him,
complicity in genocide.
   Key prosecution witnesses were to be called Monday when the
trial resumes.
   Nicu Ceausescu was the regional Communist Party secretary in
Sibiu, 155 miles northwest of Bucharest in southern Transylvania.
The city was the scene of fierce fighting during December's
revolution.
   While he steadfastly denied ordering troops to fire on
demonstrators, Ceausescu admitted to a lesser charge, illegal
possession of firearms and ammunition.
   He also admitted he ordered the destruction of the Interior
Ministry archive in Sibiu to prevent people from finding a list of
informers for the Securitate, the hated secret police.
   The trial, held in Sibiu's cultural center, was expected to last
several days. The building was ringed by half a dozen armored
personnel carriers and about 40 soldiers in full combat gear.
   During the 6{-hour court session, attended by about 200
spectators, Ceausescu testified that he had disagreed with his
parents for at least two decades on economic and political issues.
   Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu's other two children _ Valentin, 43,
a nuclear physicist, and Zoia Elena, 37, a mathematician _ have
also been in custody awaiting trial, but no date has been announced.
   The trial provided glimpses of the lifestyle of the younger
Ceausescu, who had a reputation as a playboy with a penchant for
violence.
   Although he lived in luxury by Romanian standards _ he had a
mansion with a garden and swimming pool _ he apparently feared for
his life. He told the court that all his meals were brought by
plane from Bucharest and that he never tasted ``any food from local
sources.''
   Press reports after the revolution described the younger
Ceausescu as a hated figure who had committed rapes and had killed
at least one person while speeding recklessly in his car. He was
also reported to have lost at least $1 million gambling.
   For his court appearance Saturday, Nicu wore a salt-and-pepper
blazer and an open-necked shirt, as well as sunglasses.
   His attorney asked if Ceausescu could sit during the reading of
the indictment because he was still recovering from a stab wound
suffered after his arrest Dec. 22 near Bucharest, where he was a
passenger in a car driven by his cabaret-singer mistress.
   Nicu needed surgery and six days of hospitalization after the
attack by an unidentified assailant, the court was told.
   According to the indictment, the younger Ceausescu's order to
fire on demonstrators was made in a telephone conference call with
local party leaders.
   ``From now on we are in a state of war, not ... a state of
emergency,'' the prosecutor quoted him as saying in the Dec. 17
telephone call. He said Nicu ordered troops to battle stations and
said: ``You will shoot without warning.'' Eighty-nine people were
killed in fighting between the revolutionary forces and Ceausescu's
security troops in Sibiu, the indictment said.
   More than 20 former police officers and local officials in Sibiu
have been tried and sentenced for genocide and other serious crimes
in recent months.
   Ceausescu denied issuing shoot-to-kill orders even at the height
of the revolution on Dec. 22, just hours before his parents fled
Bucharest when the army decided to back the revolution.
   Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu were arrested, convicted of genocide
at a summary military trial and executed on Dec. 25.
   Nicu Ceausescu testified that on the morning of Dec. 22, police
and leaders of the local Securitate told him they were being shot
at by demonstrators and asked him what to do. He said he told them
to take their secret files, but ``don't shoot at anybody.''

   Scheduled arms negotiations between U.S. and
Soviet officials were postponed Saturday because the Soviet
delegation did not arrive in Washington until later than expected,
a State Department spokeswoman said.
   Anita Stockman said the first round of talks would be Sunday.
   The Soviet delegation is headed by Viktor P. Karpov and is to
meet with a U.S. group led by Under Secretary Reginald Bartholomew.
   The weekend negotiations involve a half-dozen unsettled issues,
including ways to guard against cheating and whether to ban
missiles with multiple nuclear warheads.
   The goal is to expand an agreement reached last week in Moscow
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and to produce a
declaration for announcement by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their summit next week.

   The loose-knit band of radical
environmentalists known as Earth First! has gained notoriety for
such tactics as toppling power lines and billboards and driving
spikes into trees to destroy logging equipment.
   Such tactics are the only way to prevent irreversible
destruction of the environment, including the harvesting of
old-growth forests, supporters say.
   But the radical actions, dubbed ``monkeywrenching'' for the
tactics described in the 1975 novel by Edward Abbey, ``The Monkey
Wrench Gang,'' have made enemies of loggers, utility companies,
ranchers and other targets.
   ``They are a violent, terrorist group,'' said John Ross,
executive vice president of the California Cattlemen's Association.
   Two key Earth First! organizers were arrested Friday for
investigation of transportation and possession of explosives after
a pipe bomb exploded in their car, injuring both. Bail was set for
each at $100,000.
   Darryl Cherney, 33, suffered a facial cut. In addition to the
possession charge, he was booked for possession of a destructive
device in a public place and for possession of a booby trap.
   Judi Bari, 40, remained in stable condition at Highland Hospital
with a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. She was booked on
all but the booby trap charge.
   ``We suspect they intended to use the device in some way, shape
or form,'' said Oakland Police Lt. Mike Sims.
   FBI investigators are looking for a link between the car blast
and a May 10 pipe bomb that partially exploded in a
Louisiana-Pacific Lumber Co. mill in Cloverdale about 80 miles
north of San Francisco, causing minimal damage.
   But Earth First! supporters suspect that Bari and Cherney were
themselves the targets of a terrorist act, accusing both law
enforcement officials and logging interests of responsibility.
   ``This smacks of FBI tactics that were used against political
activists, like the Black Panther Party and the anti-apartheid
movement, in the '60s and '70s,'' said Earth First! activist Karen
Pickett.
   Bari's lawyer, Susan Jordan, called the arrests ``absolutely
insane.''
   ``All their past, their present, has been devoted to
non-violence,'' she said.
   In a jail interview with The Tribune of Oakland, Cherney said
that by arresting him, ``the police and the district attorney are
hiding the fact that they are incapable of going after the would-be
assassin.''
   ``This whole thing reeks of an FBI operation,'' he said.
   Cherney said both he and Bari have received numerous death
threats in recent months as they worked to drum up support for
``Redwood Summer,'' a three-month series of non-violent protests
planned for this summer.
   Modeling their plans after the ``Mississippi Summer'' civil
rights protests of 1964, supporters hope hundreds of protesters
will flock to northern California forests to participate in
blockades and sit-ins against logging.
   ``We fully expected this oppression to come down if we were
effective,'' Cherney said.
   Friends describe Bari and Cherney as committed to non-violence,
and folksinger Utah Phillips credits Bari with helping unite
loggers and environmentalists on economic reasons to oppose
clear-cutting of old-growth forests.
   Bari also led a recently successful drive to renounce
tree-spiking in northern California. A labor organizer, Bari saw
the controversial practice as an attack on the working class,
Phillips said. The campaign came after a mill worker was seriously
injured three years ago while cutting a spiked tree.
   Earth First! was founded in 1979 with the slogan ``No compromise
in defense of Mother Earth.''
   The group is loosely organized, with no officers, board of
directors or formal members. Supporters refer instead to the
``movement.'' The decentralized structure makes it impossible to
estimate membership, but more than 10,000 people subscribe to the
Earth First! Journal, which is published eight times a year.
   Earth First! co-founder David Foreman, 43, says the group is
dedicated to defending the Earth at all costs. In 1985, he wrote
``Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkeywrench,'' which includes
instructions on how to down power lines and spike trees.
   Foreman and three others were arrested in May 1989 and later
indicted on charges of conspiring to sabotage nuclear power and
arms plants in Arizona, California and Colorado. Their trial,
originally scheduled for April, has been postponed until September.
   An anonymous telephone caller who said he represented Earth
First! claimed responsibility for attacks on the California
Cattlemen's Association headquarters in Sacramento and a livestock
auction warehouse in Dixon in the same January day in 1989, said
Ross.
   In April, thousands of people in the Santa Cruz area were
without electricity for hours after two utility towers were the
targets of sabotage believed to be the work of a splinter group of
Earth First! called Earth Night Action Group, according to police.
   Earth First! supporters planned to maintain a 24-hour vigil at
Oakland Police headquarters until Cherney and Bari are released.
   ``This only deepens our commitment to non-violence, and I hope
it does the same for everybody,'' Cherney said.

<TEXT>
   In a gubernatorial race that has been
notably lacking in substantive discussion of the issues, Democratic
candidate Ann Richards drew criticism Saturday for doing just that.
   In their first joint public appearance, Richards shared the
stage with Republican nominee Clayton Williams at a centennial
celebration for Floyd County.
   Williams, speaking to about 800 people in this Panhandel county
seat, told a story about buffalo herding more than a century ago in
West Texas and described what a lousy football player he was in
high school in Fort Stockton.
   Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, took the stage next, and
spoke about a series of salient issues including education, rural
health and prison overcrowding.
   ``I worked hard on this speech,'' she said. ``I didn't come here
just to tell you all a bunch of stories.''
   But county Chamber of Commerce President Kyle Smith said Ms.
Richards reneged on an agreement to avoid making public political
statements during the Old Settlers Day celebration.
   ``Ann Richards kind of broke the rules on us,'' he said. ``Her
campaign had made it clear to us her speech wasn't going to be
political. Her camp wanted to make sure Clayton understood that so
they would have the same type of speech.''
   Many in the audience, however, said they had come to hear the
candidates discuss the issues.
   Ms. Richards was en route to another appointment late Saturday
afternoon and could not be reached for comment on whether she had
broken the rules.
   Both candidates held news conferences after the ceremony.
   At his, Williams said he had abided by the organizers' request.
   ``I came here with the understanding that we were to talk about
pioneers today,'' he said. ``A press conference is the proper time
to ask questions above the roar of the crowd.''
   Williams then reiterated that, if elected, he would push for a
law requiring parental consent for abortions for minors. The
oilman-rancher said he supports abortion only in cases of rape,
incest or danger to the mother's life.
   Williams declined to answer questions about other issues, saying
he would do so next week.
   At her news conference, Ms. Richards reiterated that, if
elected, she would push for construction of more prisons.
   She also slammed outgoing Republican Gov. Bill Clements for
vetoing a $555 million school-finance reform package, but declined
to say how she would have acted.
   The Richards campaign has accused Williams of avoiding open
debate.
   Before Saturday's ceremony, Williams approached Ms. Richards to
shake hands and she said, ``I'm so glad to see you. You don't have
to be afraid of me.''
   Williams had no reply when Ms. Richards added, ``Tell your
consultants to lay back and relax and let you be Claytie.''
   Her comment was evocative of Williams' statement earlier this
year comparing bad weather to rape. He said then, ``If it's
inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.'' Williams later apologized
for the remark.

   Police on Saturday opened fire on
demonstrators demanding an end to one-party rule. Two people were
killed and nine wounded, hospitals reported.
   The violence occurred when members of the opposition Democratic
Social Front held an illegal rally in the northern city of Bamenda,
almost 200 miles north of Yaounde, the capital of this west African
nation.
   Demonstrators set up barricades at the rally, and police opened
fire to disperse the group.

   The archconservative John Birch Society on
Saturday denounced the upcoming summit meeting between Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush.
   ``President Bush should not be welcoming Mikhail Gorbachev to
America, should not be helping him out of his severe economic
difficulties, and should not be sweeping 70 years of Soviet
barbarism under a White House rug,'' Birch spokesman John F.
McManus told a news conference.
   McManus said Gorbahev's glasnost and perestroika initiatives
were a disguise for continuing the tyranny of earlier Soviet
governments.
   He urged Bush, who begins his meetings with Gorbachev on
Thursday at the White House, not to sign any new treaties with the
Soviets.
   ``Why should we sign agreements with people when we know they're
going to break it?'' McManus said.
   McManus also read from a Birch Society advertisement appearing
in Saturday's editions of the Chicago Sun-Times that calls
Gorbachev an ``archcriminal desperately seeking Western aid to stay
in power.''
   He said the ad will appear in newspapers in the Minneapolis area
when Gorbachev and his wife Raisa visit there June 3 and in the San
Francisco area the next day.
   McManus, whose group is based in Appleton, Wis., criticized Bush
for not being more forceful in demanding independence for the
Soviet Union's Baltic republics.
   McManus charged that U.S. presidents have aided the spread of
communism by negotiating with Soviet leaders over the years.
   If Bush wants change in the Soviet Union, he should simply let
communisim fall under its own weight, McManus said.
   McManus refused to talk about whether summits have led the world
closer to peace or help create a climate in which the Berlin Wall
has been dismantled.
   ``I want to answer about the contract of the last 50 years that
helped build the Berlin Wall,'' he said.
   McManus criticized Bush and Congress for approving economic aid
for Eastern Europe, contending that Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia are still being run by Communist bureaucrats.
   ``We should not be helping these people,'' he said. ``When they
say democracy, they have literally changed nothing.''

<TEXT>
   Police arrested 18 radical students
who tried to march on the U.S. Embassy on Saturday, accusing
Washington of condoning a bloody crackdown on a 1980 uprising.
   The students were overpowered by riot police a few minutes after
they rushed out of an underground walkway 30 yards from the embassy
compound in Seoul.
   The students scattered leaflets charging the United States
condoned the military crackdown on the anti-government uprising in
the southern city of Kwangju that left about 200 people dead. The
protesters demanded an apology.
   It was the second time this week that radical students tried to
march to the U.S. Embassy. On Tuesday, eight students were arrested
when they tried to deliver a protest letter to the U.S. Embassy
concerning the Kwangju revolt.
   Radical students are in the midst of a period of
anti-government, anti-U.S. protests to mark the 10th anniversary of
the revolt on May 18, 1980. It was the bloodiest in modern Korean
history.
   Korean radicals argue that the United States took a bystander's
role during the 10-day revolt, thus condoning the crushing of the
revolt by South Korean paratroopers. The United States has denied
the allegations.
   In Kwangju, 156 miles south of Seoul, tens of thousands of
people mounted street protests to mark the anniversary last week.
One rally attracted about 100,000 people.

<HEAD>Spurned Lover Sentenced to Seven Consecutive Life Terms in Arson
Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who set fire to the home of the
lover who spurned her, killing his mother, wife and 2-year-old
daughter, was sentenced to seven consecutive life terms plus 15
years in prison.
   Vicky Chao, 46, remained subdued during sentencing Friday by
Superior Court Judge Richard S. Gebelein, and shook her head when
asked if she wished to make a statement.
   ``You were found guilty of the murders of three people, one of
which was a child,'' the judge told Chao before pronouncing
sentence. ``There is no crime on Earth, I guess, which is as
serious as that. The law does provide for a very serious penalty,
and the court is going to impose it.''
   Chao was convicted in August of six counts of first-degree
murder (one of intentional murder and one of felony murder for each
victim), one count of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of
first-degree conspiracy, and single counts of first-degree arson,
first-degree burglary and second-degree conspiracy.
   The jury could not reach a unanimous decision on the death
penalty, automatically mandating life imprisonment without
probation or parole for the murder convictions.
   Gebelein imposed a seventh life sentence for the attempted
murder count and 15 years for the other counts.
   Chao was arrested in March 1988, less than 24 hours after
setting fire to the suburban home of William Chen, 36. The fire
killed Chen's mother, Lyen Yu Chen, 56; his wife, Guo Jing Hong,
31, and their daughter, Anna Chen, 2.
   Chen, sole survivor of the pre-dawn blaze, admitted during the
trial that he and Chao had a long affair, which he had broken off
shortly before the fire.
   He testified that he barely escaped the blaze.
   He collapsed in the courtroom when the verdict against Chao was
announced, but was not present for her sentencing.
   His brother, Edward, was there and said, ``Life sentence, right?
But her family can see her, right? But our family, can't see
anymore.''
   William Chen is expected to testify against Chao's co-defendant,
Tze Poong Liu, in the fall.
   Prosecutors allege that Liu, a New York City cab driver, drove
Chao, who worked in a New York hotel, to Delaware and helped set
the fire. He is free on unsecured bail.

   A tropical depression spawning rains that could
help ease south Florida's drought dissolved Saturday as it passed
over the Florida Straits.
   The system still threatened to dump heavy rains over south
Florida, but the center dissolved Saturday morning.
   Water officials feared the rain may not travel as far north as
Lake Okeechobee, the backup water supply for most southern Florida
cities.
   The system kicked up high seas and made weekend boating
hazardous.
   The depression's center moved through the Florida Keys in a
slow, erratic path to the northeast as it dissolved into a
rainstorm, forecasters said.
   A depression is officially classified as a tropical storm and is
given a name if its top sustained surface winds reach 39 mph; those
that reach 74 mph are classified as hurricanes.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Soldiers Kill 380 Rebel Troops, Afghan Government Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan soldiers repelled an attack on
an eastern garrison town Saturday, killing 380 Moslem guerrillas,
state-run Kabul radio reported.
   Seven soldiers and four civilians were also killed and 15
civilians wounded in the attack on Khost, a besieged town 15 miles
from the Pakistan border, said Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad.
   The radio also said ``extremists'' fired 22 U.S.-made rockets
into residental areas of the capital of Kabul, killing six people
and wounding 12. The term ``extremists'' refers to the
Pakistan-based guerrillas who have been trying for 12 years to
overthrow the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan.
   The reports could not be independently verified.
   The guerrillas insist they target only military installations
but admit they sometimes misfire and hit residential areas. More
than 100 rockets hit the capital in the past week, killing at least
12 people.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan said the guerrillas apparently
stepped up their attacks on Kabul to coincide with preparations for
a government assembly that is expected to approve major changes in
the constitution. The session is also expected to loosen the grip
of the leftist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan that seized
power in a 1978 coup.
   In Khost, the radio said, thousands of guerrillas launched a
major attack on the town but were repelled by troops loyal to
Afghan President Najibullah. ``The attack was foiled by prompt
counter-operations by the military forces, and 380 extremists were
wiped from the front line and large amounts of arms and ammunition
were seized,'' it said.
   Khost, located on a high plateau and ringed by mountains, has
little strategic significance but is of symbolic value. Najibullah
and other senior members of his government are from the area.
   The rebels, who are financed by the United States, Saudi Arabia,
and other sympathetic Arab states, have moved within two miles of
the town and frequently fire heavy artillery and rockets into the
town. The guerrilla outposts are routinely bombed by government
warplanes.
   The city's airport has been closed for months and supplies to
the estimated 5,000 government troops are dropped by air.

   Mexico will seek the arrest and extradition
of a U.S. narcotics official for his alleged role in abducting a
Mexican doctor charged in the death of an American drug agent, the
Mexican attorney general's office said.
   The office said it is asking for the extradition of Hector
Berrellez, a superviser in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
and allegedly the mastermind of the kidnapping of the doctor.
   ``Based on public recognition and testimony in a trial in Los
Angeles that the DEA paid $20,000 `for services' to kidnap Dr.
Humberto Alvarez Machain from Mexican territory,'' the Attorney
General's office will ask for the extradition of Berrellez, it said
in a news release Friday.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty in Washington declined to
comment on the request for extradition.
   The Mexican doctor faces trial for alleged participation in the
1985 slaying of DEA agent Enrique Camarena.
   Berrellez testified Friday at a federal hearing in Los Angeles
that a payment of up to $50,000 was authorized for the capture of
the doctor. He said DEA Deputy Director Pete Gruden knew of the
plan.
   The abduction of the doctor from his office has caused tension
between the U.S. and Mexican governments. Mexico has demanded his
return, saying the incident was a violation of Mexican sovereignty.
   The doctor, a Guadalajara gynecologist, was arrested April 3
after being taken to El Paso, Texas, to face charges he
administered drugs to Camarena during the kidnapping, torture and
murder of the drug agent and his pilot.
   In Washington, DEA spokesman Frank Shults denied that the
government offered a reward or bounty for the people who captured
the doctor, saying a $20,000 payment was provided for ``services.''
He said it could have covered such expenses as rental of the plane
that flew the prisoner to El Paso.
   Former Mexican police officer Antonio Garate Bustamante, who is
wanted by the Mexican government, testified he paid $20,000 in DEA
money to the people who captured the doctor and was continuing to
pay their expenses.
   Garate said he arranged for the doctor to be brought across the
border with the approval of DEA officials. He said he found friends
who would do the job without advance payment.
   ``I told them that no money would be provided up front, and they
would have no assistance from the DEA,'' he said. ``Whatever they
were doing, they were doing on their own.''
   The attorney general's office said Friday that it would present
formal accusations against Berrellez and Garate in a Mexico City
district court. After obtaining warrants, it will present the
accusations to the Foreign Ministry to seek the official's
extradition.
   On April 28, the attorney general's office announced the arrest
of six Mexicans for alleged involvement in the doctor's capture.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, commenting on the case,
said Friday that the abduction ``does not help in the fight against
drug smuggling.''
   Speaking in the northern state of Chihuahua, Salinas said that
the U.S. and Mexican governments should behave with mutual respect.
   Salinas and other Mexican officials have threatened to redefine
the rules under which Mexico cooperates with the United States in
drug enforcement. However, officials at the attorney general's
office have said cooperation continues without any changes.
   Testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that
Camarena was interrogated and tortured by drug traffickers.
Prosecutors maintain that the abducted doctor gave Camarena drugs
to revive him for additional torture before he was killed.
   The drug barons reportedly were angered because Camarena's
undercover work had led U.S. and Mexican authorities to a desert
marijuana plantation, where they seized huge quantities of the drug
worth billions of dollars.

   Cuban exiles challenged visiting Soviet officials
Saturday to withdraw economic aid that helps keep Fidel Castro
afloat, but the Soviets rejected the suggestion and reaffirmed
support for Cuba's communist government.
   ``We are giving aid not to the Cuban government, but to the
Cuban people,'' Latin American specialist Yuri Pavlov of the Soviet
foreign ministry said during the rare meeting at a University of
Miami conference.
   The statement drew groans from many in the crowd of about 300
attending the ``Moscow-Miami'' conference at the Grand Bay Hotel in
Coconut Grove.
   The conference was highlighted by a discussion of U.S.-Soviet
relations by a panel that included Georgy Arbatov, a close adviser
to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and five other Soviets;
U.S. Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.; and U.S. Reps. Dante Fascell and
Larry Smith, both D-Fla.
   The discussion covered a broad range of topics, including
economic cooperation, arms reduction and emigration by Soviet Jews.
   But there was one dominant issue for members of Miami's Cuban
exile community who attended to plead their case against Castro.
   ``No nation is in a better position to influence the Cuban
government,'' said Jorge Mas Canosa, an adamant foe of Castro's
regime and chairman of the conservative Cuban American National
Foundation. ``If the (Soviets) withdraw their subsidy, the Cuban
problem would be solved in 48 hours.''
   But several of the Soviet visitors disagreed with Mas. Several
countered that U.S. trade with Cuba would reduce the need for
Soviet economic aid and might lead to reforms.
   ``We have full respect for the views of the Cuban communists,''
said Pavlov. ``We are against an economic blockade of any one
country.''
   When the groans and cries of ``Lithuania!'' rang out from the
back of the room, Jiri Valenta, director of the university's
Institute for Soviet and East European Studies, quickly moved to
the microphone.
   ``We will conduct this conference in a civilized manner,'' he
said, quieting the audience.
   Much of the conference was quite civilized, with only a small
group of protesters across the street from the luxury hotel to
criticize the Soviet alliance with Castro.
   Before the recent dramatic changes in East-West relations, the
appearance of Soviet officials in Miami would have provoked far
more anger in the exile community.
   In the recent past, pro-communist entertainers have been banned
from performing and paintings by pro-communist artists have been
censored. In 1984, a city councilman even tried to prevent a visit
by Miss Yugoslavia.
   But as Cuban broadcaster Tomas Regalado said in an earlier
interview about the Soviet visit, ``This is something that Fidel
will not like. The bottom line is if Fidel doesn't like it, we like
it.''
   The Soviet delegation included reform-minded members of the
Supreme Soviet, Latin American specialists, and journalists.
   After the two-day conference ends Sunday, most of the Soviets
plan to fly to Washington for the Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting.

   Two Florida prison escapees shot and
killed a National Park ranger, but minutes later were wounded and
captured by police, authorities said.
   A woman called police around 9 a.m. and said she had escaped
from two men who abducted her and brought her to a motel in this
Gulf Coast city, said Police Chief Carolyn Frayser.
   The escapees kidnapped Marie Long Burnette, 55, early Friday
from an Alabama motel where she worked as a night clerk, police
said.
   Dempsey Alexander Bruner, 29, and John Fred Woolard, 27, had
escaped Thursday morning from Holmes Correctional Instititution
near Bonifay, Fla., while out on a doctor's visit, Florida
authorities said.
   Bruner was serving a 20-year sentence for crimes including
sexual battery, kidnapping and robbery. Woolard was serving 15
years for crimes including burglary, cocaine possession, battery on
a law enforcement officer and a previous escape.
   Both were hospitalized in stable condition Saturday with gunshot
wounds to the legs, hospital spokesmen said.
   Authorities said the details remained unclear of the events that
led to the death of Robert L. McGhee Jr., 50, a ranger who was
armed and on duty in the Gulf Islands National Seashore Park.
   An off-duty ranger who lives nearby heard a shot and found
McGhee on the side of the road.
   McGhee, who was shot several times in the chest and head, was
pronounced dead at the park at 9:13 a.m., said Jackson County
Coroner James Miller.
   The escapees, with Burnette, had checked into the Ocean Springs
motel at 4 p.m. Friday, Frayser said.
   She said officers responding to Burnette's call found the
escapees minutes later near the park.
   In an ensuing car chase, the suspects tried to ram a police car,
causing one officer minor contusions.
   A shootout followed, and the escapees were captured in woods
next to the park, Frayser said.
   Unknown to police, the escapees had encountered McGhee about a
mile away, she said.
   McGhee was married and had two children.

<TEXT>
   Lithuania's premier Saturday said her
republic will stand by its declaration of independence despite
pressures from the Kremlin, and she said it could attain
sovereignty within six months.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said Lithuania could
become independent in two or three years if the republic backs down
from its March 11 declaration and follows Soviet procedures for
secession.
   Officials in Lithuania said hot water supplies throughout the
Baltic republic were shut off because regional distribution
stations ran out of oil as a result of Soviet economic sanctions.
   Lithuanian Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene, in a speech to a
congress of German Catholics, said: ``No one can demand from us a
withdrawal of the declaration of independence.''
   She added the Lithuanian government had receiveda popular
mandate to ``secede from the empire'' and appealed to the world's
estimated 950 million Roman Catholics for support. Lithuania is
predominantly Roman Catholic.
   The Lithuanian premier also blasted Gorbachev during the
address, saying he had not decided between ``democracy and being
reactionary.'' Mrs. Prunskiene accused him of unfairly calling the
Lithuanian movement a threat to his plans to revamp Soviet society.
   The West Berlin audience of 4,000 people applauded her for
several minutes after the address, which she delivered in German.
   In talks with reporters, Ms. Prunskiene said she was ``hopeful''
that a solution could be found to end the stalemate.
   In an interview with West Germany's Saarland State Radio, Ms.
Prunskiene said the Baltic republic could achieve sovereignty in
six months. She said Lithuania's future was closely linked to the
pro-democracy situation in all of Eastern Europe.
   ``When all of Eastern Europe is developing in this direction,
then we'll also achieve independence in Lithuania more quickly,''
she told the radio station.
   On Friday, Gorbachev called Lithuanian leaders ``adventurists.''
   ``We have great reserves of will power, but we are looking for
ways'' to end the impasse, Gorbachev said.
   In an interview with Time magazine, Gorbachev said: ``We are
looking for a way to restore constitutional order and authority,
and to do so by political means.''
   He refused to comment further but added that ``recently we've
seen some new and encouraging signs.'' The transcript of the
session appears in the June 4 edition of the magazine.
   Also on Saturday, thousands of Georgians held rallies in the
southern Soviet republic's capital of Tbilisi to mark the 72nd
anniversary of their brief independence from the Soviet Union,
witnesses said.
   About 5,000 people attended two pro-independence rallies
sponsored by the National Forum, a union of about 40 political
groups, and Round Table, comprised of four other political
organizations.
   Georgia declared independence on May 26, 1918, and remained
independent until Feb. 25, 1921, when it was forcibly annexed by
the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Long Line for Final Day of Mapplethorpe Show</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Robert Mapplethorpe photo exhibit ended
Saturday the way it began _ with a long line waiting to see the
pictures that prompted an obscenity indictment.
   Nearly 4,000 people lined up Saturday at the Contemporary Arts
Center to see the 175 photos, including seven mentioned in the
indictment, before the show closed. The line stretched onto the
street in front of the arcade that houses the art gallery.
   The 3,902 patrons brought the show's final total to 79,893,
easily a record for the arts center, a spokesman said.
   The exhibit goes next to the Boston Institute of Contemporary
Art, where it is to open Aug. 1.
   Boston Institute Director David Ross said he expects a quieter
reaction than in Cincinnati.
   ``The Perfect Moment,'' a display of the late Mapplethorpe's
photographs, includes seven that a Hamilton County grand jury found
objectionable. The arts center and its director, Dennis Barrie, are
under indictment on misdemeanor charges of obscenity and displaying
children in nudity-oriented matter.
   Five of the photos show homoerotic acts; two show naked or
partly naked children.
   The exhibit had a preview showing April 6 for arts center
members. When it opened to the public the next day, the grand jury
was among the spectators.
   The case remains unresolved. Another court appearance is
scheduled next week.
   The controversy only fueled public interest in the exhibit, and
the local dispute became a national cause.
   ``Cincinnati has become a microcosm of what is happening all
over America,'' Barrie said. ``In one way, it's very positive for
Cincinnati. I like being able to help shape the future direction of
national concerns.''
   Mapplethorpe's name was first heard outside the art world last
June when Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., showed copies of his
controversial photographs to members of Congress.
   The Corcoran Gallery in Washington canceled its showing of ``The
Perfect Moment.'' But the exhibit had been shown in six cities
without incident before it reached Cincinnati.
   In February, a local group called Citizens for Community Values
began a mail campaign calling for ``action to prevent this
pornographic art from being shown in our city.'' The arts center,
its board members and board members' employers received hundreds of
protest letters and calls.
   The center voluntarily withdrew from the city's Fine Arts Fund
on March 25, fearing its inclusion might damage the 1990 fund drive.
   The exhibit's opening drew further attention when police
temporarily closed it to videotape the photographs.
   The arts community feared the exhibit would be closed to the
public. But U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin issued a temporary
restraining order April 8 barring law enforcement officials from
closing the exhibit until the obscenity question was resolved in
court.

   Eleven people were injured Saturday by
a smoke grenade thrown into refugee housing, and arsonists burned
down 15 barracks elsewhere in the latest of a spate of attacks on
the public centers.
   Immigration authorities put all the government-funded refugee
centers on alert, an immigration official said. Police officers
were starting around-the-clock guard at some places, the television
reported.
   The 11 refugees were slightly injured in an attack early
Saturday when a smoke grenade was thrown into a building housing
refugees outside Motala, 160 miles south of Stockholm.
   Hours later, arsonists burned down 15 barracks to be used by
refugees in a community further south outside Laholm, police said.
   Swastikas and hate slogans, such as ``no niggers,'' were painted
on walls.
   ``We have called up centers in all regions and told them to be
on the lookout,'' Lena Hall-Eriksson, the national immigration
official, told a reporter on Swedish national television.
   Hall-Eriksson said the attacks ``may be organized, or maybe one
incident is inspiring the other.''
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson denounced the attacks as
``criminal acts.''
   This country of 8.4 million inhabitants has long had liberal
immigration policies. Nearly 20,000 refugees have moved to Sweden
every year, many from Iran, Ethiopia and other Third World
countries.
   Until recently, there had been few reports of violent opposition
to the influx.
   The recent wave of attacks flared up about a week ago when
windows were shattered at the center outside Motala. On Thursday,
two barracks that were being prepared for refugees in Kimstad, 90
miles south of Stockholm, were burned to the ground.

   About 90 campers, some in trees, were rescued
Saturday after heavy rains caused a creek of the Mineral Fork River
to rise and flood several campgrounds, authorities said.
   ``You could see them hanging in the tops of the trees, waving
flashlights and screaming for help,'' said Dennis Spradling, a
firefighter for the Potosi Fire Protection District.
   Dozens of people, including Washington County sheriff's
deputies, firefighters from about 15 area departments and
volunteers, used boats to help rescue campers near this eastern
Missouri town, Spradling said.
   The water was over Highway 21, hampering rescuers' efforts, he
said.
   The river already had been high, following persistent rains
through most of May.
   The call for help came in about 12:30 a.m., Spradling said.
People were rescued from four campgrounds just south of Washington
State Park, about 13 miles north of Potosi. They were taken to a
nearby school.
   There were no major injuries, Spradling said. Three boats sank
in the rain and fast-moving water.
   By mid-afternoon Saturday, the high water was receding and
authorities were checking campers, other vehicles and camping
equipment. There were no reports of missing people, Spradling said.
   The area got about 2.5 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at
   John Feldt of the National Weather Service said the area got
about 2.5 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending at 7 a.m. Saturday.
He said the heaviest rain was in central Missouri, with Iberia
getting about 6 inches in that period.

   An upcoming critical biography of L. Ron
Hubbard, author and founder of the Church of Scientology, may be
published in its original form, a federal appeals court ruled.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court's
ruling in February for New Era Publications International,
exclusive licensee of Hubbard's works, which had filed a copyright
infringement lawsuit.
   Hubbard died in 1986.
   The appeals court held Thursday that the book's quotations from
Hubbard's published works, which amount to about 3 percent of the
total biography, constituted fair use.
   Michael Lee Hertzberg, an attorney for New Era Publications,
said his client had not decided whether to appeal.
   The book is ``A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L.
Ron Hubbard Exposed,'' by Jon Atack, a former Scientology member
who turned against the church, claiming it is a dangerous cult.
   The book is scheduled to be shipped to stores in June, said
Steven Schragis, president of Carol Publishing Group.

   Kidnappers holding two American hostages
vowed Saturday to make the United States and Israel ``pay the
price'' for the massacre of seven Palestinian workers in Israel
last week.
   However, the statement by the Organization of Islamic Jihad for
the Liberation of Palestine did not directly threaten to harm the
two hostages.
   In another hostage development Saturday, PLO leader Yasser
Arafat reportedly said two Swiss Red Cross workers kidnapped in
Lebanon seven months ago are alive, and he offered to help mediate
their release.
   The Arabic-language statement, delivered to a Western news
agency in Beirut, came with an instant picture of U.S. hostages
Jesse Turner and Alann Steen. They were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987,
from Beirut University College.
   The picture showed a smiling, bespectacled Turner wearing a
bushy black beard and a striped pullover. Steen wore a dark
jumpsuit and a beard, and his hair was slightly disheveled. Both
looked straight at the camera.
   The picture resembled a photograph the group released Feb. 23,
1989, showing Turner and Steen along with former American hostage
Robert Polhill.
   However, the two photographs were clearly different, because
Turner's hair was much longer in the later one.
   On April 22, the same group released Polhill, a New Yorker and a
lecturer in accounting who was kidnapped with Steen and Turner.
   Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, and Steen, 50, a native of Boston,
were professors serving with the U.S.-affiliated college when they
were abducted by gunmen posing as Lebanese riot police.
   Eight days after Polhill was freed, another pro-Iranian group,
the Organization of Islamic Dawn, released American hostage Frank
Herbert Reed, 57, of Malden, Mass., after 3{ years in captivity.
   Iranian leaders and their Lebanese allies have since complained
the United States has failed to respond with a goodwill gesture of
its own.
   ``America is directly responsible for shedding the blood of our
people and their cause,'' the 18-line statement said Saturday,
referring to the shooting deaths of seven Arab laborers in a Tel
Aviv suburb on May 20.
   Israeli officials have said the accused gunman, a former
soldier, was apparently deranged. The shootings prompted widespread
unrest among Arabs in Jordan, Israel and the occupied territories.
Arafat also cited the killings when he urged the U.N. Security
Council in Geneva on Friday to send an international force to
protect Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   ``We warn America and Israel that future developments will not
be in the interest of either of them. They will realize that the
blood will not be wasted. They will pay the price,'' the
kidnappers' statement said.
   ``America seeks at all costs to retain its base, Israel, in the
East and will not permit even verbal resolutions of an adverse
nature against Israel.'' This was seen as a reference to frequent
U.S. vetoes of U.N. Security Council resolutions condemning Israeli
actions.
   Asked about the statement, State Department spokeswoman Anita
Stockman said: ``I don't really have have anything I can comment on
in terms of the report except to say that our general policy is to
say that the hostages should be freed immediately and
unconditionally.''
   The Foreign Ministry spokesman in Israel refused to comment.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine took
responsibility for the kidnapping of Turner, Steen, Polhill and
fellow professor Mitheleshwar Singh, who was released Oct. 3, 1988.
   The group's statement Saturday condemned the slaying of seven
Palestinian workers as a crime. It called the international uproar
over the killings ``artificial patronage'' and a ``hollow storm of
empty words,'' and said the ``effective deterrent is force.''
   Turner and Steen are among 16 Western hostages held in Lebanon,
most of them by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem zealots. The captives are
six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an
Italian and an Irishman.
   After the U.N. Security Council session in Geneva on Friday,
Arafat discussed the two Swiss hostages with Pierre-Yves Simonin, a
ranking Swiss Foreign Ministry official, a department spokeswoman
said Saturday.
   But the PLO chief did not say where Emanuel Christen and Elio
Erriquez of the all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross
were being held or by whom. The spokeswoman, Andrea Reichlin, also
said Arafat offered to mediate between the kidnappers and Swiss
authorities if such contacts come about.
   In a meeting with Cornelio Sommaruga, president of the
Geneva-based ICRC, Arafat repeated his assurance that the two
hostages are alive, she said.
   Erriquez and Christen were taken captive Oct. 6 in the southern
Lebanese port city of Sidon, where they helped run an artificial
limb center for victims of civil war. No one claimed responsibility
for the kidnapping.
   However, the men are believed held by the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, the group headed by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal, who
broke with Arafat years ago. Palestinian sources linked the
abduction to a Lebanese Moslem Shiite, Hussein Hariri, jailed for
life in Switzerland in February 1989 for hijacking an Air Afrique
jetliner two years earlier and killing a French passenger.
   Of the 16 Western hostages, the longest-held is U.S. journalist
Terry Anderson, 42, of Lorain, Ohio, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Most Americans expect President Bush to ask
Congress to increase taxes, and less than half say he never meant
his campaign pledge of ``no new taxes,'' according to a New York
Times-CBS News poll.
   The most acceptable tax to raise would be the federal excise tax
on beer, wine and liquor _ chosen by 80 percent of the 1,140 adults
surveyed in the poll published in Sunday editions of the Times.
   About 78 percent said to raise the tax on income over $200,000.
   Bush has declined to say whether his staunch campaign opposition
to tax increases is still in effect.
   But nearly 70 percent of those surveyed Tuesday through Thursday
expect Bush to seek higher taxes, and 40 percent say he never meant
his no-tax pledge.
   Asked what should be cut from the budget, 83 percent said reduce
foreign aid and 64 percent said reduce military spending.
   Unacceptable areas for cuts included education (named by 86
percent), Social Security increases (82 percent) and the
environment (74 percent).
   Neither party gained a clear advantage in the survey when people
were asked which party was more likely to raise taxes. About 38
percent said Republicans were, and 42 percent picked the Democrats.
   The poll's margin of error was 3 percentage points.

   An explosion ripped through a downtown chemical
plant Saturday, killing at least seven workers and injuring 19, the
fire department said.
   The blast occurred early in the day at Dai-ichi Chemical
Industries in northwestern Tokyo, burning down nine factory
buildings, said a city fire official.
   At the time, 51 employees were working in the factory, which
manufactures bleaching agents, chlorides and other chemicals. The
condition of the remaining 25 was unknown, though most were thought
to have escaped, the fire official said.
   No damage was reported outside the factory, said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Chiyo Ito, a 21-year-old waitress at a coffee shop next to the
factory, told Kyodo News Service that she saw three factory workers
run out of the building with their clothes on fire.
   Neighbors beat out the flames and splashed water on the victims
while they waited for ambulances, Kyodo quoted Ms. Ito as saying.
   The fire department was investigating the cause of the
explosion, the official said.
   Dai-ichi Chemical Industries was founded in 1953.

   Actor Robert Wagner and actress
Jill St. John were married Saturday in a private ceremony in the
garden of Wagner's Pacific Palisades home.
   Wagner, 60, and Miss St. John, 49, have been together for eight
years, said publicist Alan Nierob.
   Katherine Wagner, 26, served as maid-of-honor. Natasha Gregson,
19, and Courtney Brooke, 16, were bridesmaids. Also attending were
Wagner's mother and sister and Miss St. John's mother, Nierob said.
   Wagner was married twice to the late actress Natalie Wood. On
Nov. 29, 1981, Miss Wood accidentally slipped from Wagner's 60-foot
yacht Splendour and drowned off Santa Catalina Island, Calif., at
age 43.
   After Miss Wood's death, Wagner gave the yacht to the Sea
Scouts, sold their rambling Beverly Hills home and moved to a
Sunset Boulevard estate with Natasha, Miss Wood's daughter from her
marriage to English producer Richard Gregson; Courtney, born to
Miss Wood and Wagner after they married a second time in 1972, and
Katherine, Wagner's daughter from his marriage to dancer Marian
Marshall.
   Wagner and Miss Wood's first five-year marriage ended in 1965.
   Miss St. John, whose films include ``Diamonds are Forever,'' was
previously married and divorced three times.
   Wagner, who has been in numerous films, starred in the TV series
``Hart to Hart'' from 1979-84.

   A person wearing a Bozo costume and
bearing flowers and balloons shot a woman in the face Saturday when
she opened her front door.
   The suspect _ with a costume that included red hair, an orange
nose and white gloves _ sped out of the exclusive Palm Beach County
development in a white car without a license plate, police said.
   The victim, 40-year-old Marlene Warren, was in critical
condition on a respirator at Palms West Hospital Saturday night.
   Investigators said they had some leads, but none solid enough to
determine a motive or suspects. They said it appeared that Mrs.
Warren was the target. Her son and some friends were home and saw
the shooting about 11 a.m.
   Mrs. Warren opened the door for the clown, investigators said,
and took the flowers and balloons without saying anything.
   ``As soon as she reached out and grabbed it, he pulled out a
revolver and shot her once in the face,'' said Sheriff's Detective
Sgt. Lou Sessa.
   Mrs. Warren and her husband Michael own several properties,
including duplexes in West Palm Beach and an auto dealership.

   The bloodiest election campaign in
Colombia's 180 years of independence comes to a close with Sunday's
presidential voting, but many feared that the terror unleashed by
drug traffickers would continue.
   Officials accused the drug barons of using violence to keep
people away from the polls. The army and police mobilized 230,000
troops for election-day duty, and military checkpoints lined major
streets and highways.
   Just hours before the polls were to open, President Virgilio
Barco exhorted Colombians to vote in defiance of the terrorism.
   ``To vote is to support democracy, to reject violence and to
defend the rights that the terrorists want to snatch from us,''
Barco said in his nationally broadcast speech.
   He added, ``I do not have the slightest doubt that both the
terrorist acts aimed at taking the lives of presidential candidates
as well as those committed against other compatriots have been
carried out to intimidate the popular will.''
   Some Colombians said they planned to vote early _ to cut the
time spent standing in line, thus reducing the risk of being killed
or maimed in an attack.
   Colombia's drug war has overshadowed every other issue in the
presidential campaign.
   In the past nine months, three presidential candidates, 262
policemen, 93 soldiers, three judges, 15 news media employees and
about 1,700 other people have been slain.
   Bombs have exploded at schools, churches, shopping centers and
supermarkets. One bomb destroyed a Colombian airliner, killing all
107 people aboard.
   In the two weeks leading up to Sunday's balloting, nine bombs
exploded in four Colombian cities, killing 37 people and wounding
more than 320.
   Few of the crimes have been solved, but suspicion for most of
the killings has fallen on drug traffickers, who have private
armies and billions of dollars in cocaine profits at their disposal.
   Right-wing death squads and leftist guerrillas also have played
roles in the carnage.
   The army and police said 230,000 troops would be out in force
for the election, and a curfew was imposed in the drug capital of
Medellin following a wave of bombings and murders.
   Government officials have expressed fears that intimidation by
traffickers would prevent some people from voting, and accused the
drug lords of stepping up attacks to scare people. There are about
13.8 million eligible voters.
   Barco and his wife planned to vote as soon as the polls opened,
as is traditional for the president. Barco's four-year term ends
Aug. 7, and the constitution prohibits a president from serving two
successive terms.
   There are 12 candidates for president. Only four are considered
to have nationwide backing.
   The ruling Liberal Party's candidate, Cesar Gaviria, is
considered the leading contender. He is the only candidate who has
promised to continue Barco's tough policies against the
traffickers, including extradition of drug traffickers to the
United States.
   Gaviria replaced the party's front-running presidential
contender, Luis Carlos Galan, who was assassinated last Aug. 18.
   It was the killing of Galan _ which authorities blamed on
traffickers _ that set off the government's offensive against the
drug trade, including the resumption of the government's
extradition policy.
   One main presidential contender, Alvaro Gomez, has urged
legalization of cocaine in the major drug-consuming countries. He
says the only way to put the traffickers out of business is to
deprive them of profits.
   Gomez, an independent, and the other two main candidates,
Rodrigo Lloreda and Navarro Wolf, all say they would likely stop
the extraditions. The Barco government has extradited 15 drug
suspects to the United States in the past nine months.
   Gaviria says he would continue extraditions at least until
Colombia is able to put traffickers in jail and keep them there.
   No other issue claimed anything approaching the attention given
to the drug war.
   ``The traffickers' dark shadow of terrorism has blotted out all
other issues,'' said Enrique Santos, whose family owns the Bogota
daily El Tiempo, Colombia's largest newspaper. ``There is nothing
philosophical about this election.''
   Indeed, the candidates have scarcely mentioned such pressing
issues as unemployment, inflation and the need for land reform.
   Unemployment is running 9 percent, according to government
figures. Private economists say it is 20 percent. Inflation is
running at 28 percent, up from 26 percent last year.
   Clara Lopez, a former Bogota city council president, says
drug-related violence poses less of a threat than social injustice,
which she says could lead to unrest.
   ``All of Colombia's problems originate with the inequitable
distribution of land,'' said Lopez, a human rights activist who has
campaigned for constitutional reforms.
   Colombians also decide Sunday whether a constituent assembly
should be named to consider changes in the 1886 constitution.
Proponents of the assembly say the constitution must be altered to
make the judicial system stronger and to break up large land
holdings.
   According to a 1970 census, the last that tracked land
distribution, ownership of 68 percent of the land is concentrated
in the hands of 4.3 percent of the population.
   But even that problem goes back to drug traffickers. The army
has said traffickers own millions of acres of land.
   Gaviria and other presidential candidates, following Barco's
lead, have insisted that the root of the problem lies with the
insatiable appetite for cocaine in other countries, especially in
the United States.

   The Rev. Desmond Tutu said he was more
surprised by the recent changes in South Africa than the fact that
tens of thousands of pro-apartheid demonstrators turned out in
Pretoria on Saturday to protest them.
   ``They've been supporting apartheid for so long,'' Tutu, South
Africa's Anglican archbishop, told a news conference. ``What is
surprising is that we should see a government that is willing to
risk that.''
   Since coming to power last year, South African President F.W. de
Klerk has freed African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela
from prison, promised apartheid would end within five years and
taken other measures to end discriminatory policies.
   Tutu said it's not surprising that whites who enjoyed privileges
under apartheid would object to losing some of them.
   ``The surprising thing is that the government should in fact
have broken loose from that kind of thinking,'' he said.
   Tens of thousands of whites shouted their support for white
minority rule and condemned de Klerk at the rally Saturday in
Pretoria.
   Tutu, in Cincinnati for a four-day visit, said if he had been
able to address the demonstrators, he would have told them they
cannot prevail.
   ``I'd say to them, `You do have the right to hold that rally,
but ultimately it is self-defeating,''' he said. ``What in fact are
you seeking to do? You are seeking to carve out for yourself a
separate freedom. Now the world has discovered that freedom is
indivisible.''
   ``There's a spirit that cannot be quenched,'' he said, referring
to recent changes in, for example, Eastern Europe. ``A repressive
government, an unjust system, are based on a foundation that is
fundamentally unstable.''
   Tutu is spending the weekend meeting with religious leaders and
representatives of the black community, and making numerous public
appearances.
   The cleric, on a six-city trip through the United States, said
he's enjoying the chance to visit a country with freedom and
opportunities.
   ``You do get a sense of how wonderful it is _ despite all of the
awful messes that are happening _ at how wonderful it is in fact to
live in a free country,'' he said. ``Let's say a country that seeks
to be ever more free.''
   Tutu said he dreams of a day when diversity will be cherished in
his country and liberties will be guaranteed.
   ``What we dream about is a country that will have a bill of
rights that guarantees individual rights,'' he said. ``And then I
hope that we would be absolutely libertarian, totally libertarian.''

<TEXT>
   A party host was charged with
manslaughter in the death of a teen-age guest who apparently
inhaled laughing gas, authorities said.
   Jonathan Sutton, 23, of suburban Homewood surrendered to
Jefferson County authorities Friday night on charges stemming from
the death of Kristi Ann Lowery, 18. He was released on $5,000 bond,
a deputy said.
   The high school senior died May 20 after apparently inhaling
undiluted nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, at the
party, authorities said.
   The gas played a role in the woman's death, said Jefferson
County Chief Deputy Coroner Jay Glass. When undiluted, nitrous
oxide can cut off oyxgen to the brain or trigger irregular
heartbeats, he said.
   Sutton surrendered on the advice of his attorney, J. Scott
Boudreaux, who accused the district attorney's office of yielding
to public pressure to bring charges.
   University of Alabama at Birmingham officials fired Sutton from
his job as a university store clerk last week after he told
Homewood police he had taken home the gas container linked to Miss
Lowery's death, said university spokeswoman Pam Jones.
   Campus police charged him with theft of property, she said.
   Chief Deputy District Attorney Roger Brown said Boudreaux called
him Friday asking if there were any other charges against his
client. After being told Sutton was being charged with
manslaughter, Boudreaux took him to the county jail, Brown said.

   Tens of thousands of flag-waving
whites staged the largest pro-apartheid rally since President F.W.
de Klerk came to power last year and cheered a pledge by right-wing
leaders to defend white power.
   Andries Treurnicht, leader of the main opposition Conservative
Party, said whites would resist any effort to impose a black
majority government and called for early elections to oust de Klerk.
   About 50,000 whites, including many women and children, attended
the rally under deep blue skies at the Voortrekker Monument, a
shrine to Afrikaner nationalism. Organizers claimed 150,000 people
attended.
   ``Stay White'' and ``The struggle for a free state has begun,''
said some of the posters carried by protesters.
   ``The so-called New South Africa of forced integration, which
the government is forcing on us, gives us no other choice but to
defend our rights,'' Treurnicht said as the huge throng cheered and
clapped.
   ``We shall not accept the threatened destruction of our nation's
freedom, but will fight to restore that which has already been
unjustly given away,'' he said.
   Treurnicht denounced Nelson Mandela and his African National
Congress as Communists and terrorists. He claimed black
nationalists would impose Communist dictatorship if they gained
power.
   ``The ANC hates the Boer people and the white nation. They
demand our land. They reject our right to exist,'' he said as the
crowd screamed its approval.
   Mandela addressed a rally in the nearby black township of
Atteridgeville, where he told about 40,000 cheering blacks that the
right wing could not preserve white rule.
   ``Today, at this moment, in fact, Andries Treurnicht, that
prophet of doom, is meeting over that hill ... in order to oppose
the effort made by the ANC and the government to bring peace into
this country,'' Mandela said. ``We say to Treurnicht, `We have
defeated greater men than himself.'
   ``He will be defeated.''
   In Cincinnati, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said if he had a chance
to address the white demonstrators, he would have told them that
freedom will prevail.
   ``I'd say to them you do have the right to hold that rally, but
ultimately it is self-defeating,'' he said. ``What in fact are you
seeking to do? You are seeking to carve out for yourself a separate
freedom.''
   ``The world has discovered that freedom is indivisible,'' said
Tutu, South Africa's Anglican archbishop and Nobel peace laureate.
   Treurnicht's rally marked the launch of the right wing's ``Third
Freedom Struggle,'' a reference to two 19th century wars against
Britain. Treurnicht presented a Freedom Manifesto that called for
nationwide struggle for a white state.
   He denounced de Klerk for moving to end white-minority rule and
share power with the black majority. De Klerk, who came to power
last August, legalized the ANC and released Mandela in February
after 27 years in prison, but he has stopped short of supporting
black majority rule.
   Treurnicht, who received a thunderous ovation from the crowd as
he arrived in a horse-drawn carriage, was escorted by about 200
horsemen in a ``commando,'' or Afrikaner war party.
   The crowd waved hundreds of blue, red, white and green flags of
the old Transvaal Republic, which was defeated by Britain in the
Boer War. Afrikaners, whites of mainly Dutch descent, dominate
South African politics.
   Scores of uniformed and armed members of ultra-right groups
attended the rally, and some carried signs with slogans such as
``Hang Mandela.''
   ``Of course I'm a racist. The blacks are racist. I know I'm
better than blacks,'' said one right-winger who would not give his
name.
   In Johannesburg, de Klerk predicted substantial changes in South
Africa's relations with the rest of the world. He returned Saturday
from 18 days of explaining his reform policies in Europe.
   ``I can report back to you today that substantial change in the
relations of Europe with South Africa will come. And I believe
through Europe, the international community will follow,'' he told
about 1,000 cheering supporters at Jan Smuts Airport.
   The government cannot be forced to call elections until 1994 and
de Klerk is confident he can carry out reforms and gain acceptance
in that time.
   Treurnicht said little that was new and was vague on what the
Conservatives would do if the government refuses to hold elections.
He said his party would follow legal means of opposition.
   ``As long as there is a constitutional path open whereby we can
regain political control, we will use that strategy to win a
victory at the polling booth,'' he said.
   But Treurnicht did make veiled references to a white backlash if
de Klerk ends white minority rule. ``Do not force our people to
stand in your path and to challenge you to walk over us. ... There
is no boat waiting for us in the harbor,'' he said.
   The government contends the right wing cannot stop the reforms
begun by de Klerk. But officials admit privately that many whites
are flocking to the Conservatives because of their opposition to
ending white rule.

   A young former fugitive who confessed to
three slayings was returned to Delaware from Louisiana on Saturday,
and ordered held without bond in the slayings of his parents 1{
years ago.
   Charles Cohen, 25, had eluded capture until Thursday when,
facing simple battery and attempted robbery charges under an
assumed name, he stunned spectators in a Louisiana courtroom with
his confession.
   Cohen disappeared at the same time the bodies of his parents,
Martin and Ethel, were discovered on Nov. 14, 1988, in their home
in the northern Delaware town of Hockessin.
   Martin Cohen, 58, was director of the Delaware State Hospital,
the state psychiatric hospital. His 63-year-old wife was an
occupational therapist.
   Cohen has told police the identity of the third person he claims
to have killed, Attorney General Charles Oberly told a news
conference Saturday. Oberly would not release the identity of the
person, but said the homicide did not occur in Delaware or a
neighboring state.
   The state's top prosecutor said he expected police to confirm
the details within 24 hours.
   Cohen managed to avoid capture despite publicity on the Fox
network's weekly television show, ``America's Most Wanted.'' He had
long hair and facial hair when he disappeared, but looked ``like an
all-American boy'' when he was captured, New Castle County police
chief Thomas Gordon said.
   Cohen, a former student at the University of Delaware, had been
lead singer in a rock band in Illinois.
   Police were still tracing Cohen's path as a fugitive, but said
he moved to New Orleans in mid-February from New York City.
   At the time of his arrest, Cohen identified himself as James
McDowell, said Capt. Bob Garner, a sheriff's spokesman in Gretna,
La.
   Cohen was closeted with New Castle County police from his
arrival in Delaware around 1 p.m. until he was turned over for
arraignment six hours later.
   Delaware Magistrate Paul Smith ordered Cohen held without bond
on two first-degree murder counts, and Cohen was taken to Gander
Hill Prison Saturday night, police said. His preliminary hearing
was set for June 5.

   Rain, strong winds and lightning
Saturday knocked out power to about 5,000 people, swelled rivers,
blew over trees and whipped up a tornado, authorities said.
   No injuries or deaths were reported in the severe storm, which
included a funnel cloud sighted in a small, rural community in
Fayette County, about 30 miles southeast of Charleston.
   The storm left about 5,000 people in five counties without power
before it subsided Saturday night. Meteorologist Barry Gooden of
the National Weather Service said more rain was expected in the
area Sunday.
   Jack Shaver, a spokesman for Appalachian Power Co., said high
winds knocked trees into power lines and downed some poles.
Emergency crews were sent out to restore service by early Sunday,
he said.
   The state police said in a written statement that a tornado
touched down in the Gauley Bridge community, where trees were blown
over, power lines were downed and streets were covered by up to 3
feet of water.
   A tree knocked a power line onto the roof of the state police
office at Gauley Bridge, cutting electricity and telephone service,
the statement said.
   A dispatcher for the Fayette County Sheriff's Department said no
storm-related injuries or deaths were reported. The Gauley Bridge
fire department also had no such reports.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev says he'll keep hundreds of
thousands of Soviet troops in eastern Germany and will review his
policies on European arms control and security negotiations if a
united Germany joins NATO.
   The Soviet president's comments Friday came six days before he
discusses German unification with President Bush in Washington. It
amounted to a new Kremlin bargaining chip, a message that the West
would pay a high price for German membership in the Western
military alliance.
   Gorbachev repeated the Soviet preference Friday that Germany
belong to both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The Bush administration favors only NATO
membership for a united Germany.
   Gorbachev also suggested Friday that a united Germany could
follow France's lead and take part only in NATO political
activities.

package that includes $720 million in emergency aid for Panama and
Nicaragua.
   The president signed the measure despite misgivings about what
the White House regards as pork-barrel add-ons by Congress and
concerns about restrictions on his ability to enter into
international agreements affecting NATO.

   The Navy and independent analysts will conduct
new tests over the next two weeks in the hopes of determining
exactly what caused the explosion aboard the USS Iowa that claimed
47 lives.
   Congress called for the testing _ and the Navy said it would
comply _ in light of congressional findings announced Friday that
lawmakers said ``cast grave doubt'' on the Navy's official
conclusion that a troubled sailor probably caused the blast last
April 19, 1980.
   Officials of the General Accounting Office told members of the
Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday that the Iowa explosion
may well have been an accident.
   The Navy, in a report last September, concluded that gunner's
mate Clayton Hartwig probably set off the April 19, 1989, explosion
by inserting a chemical detonator between bags of powder.

   Reform Judaism, one of the three major Jewish
branches in the United States, is considering lifting age-old
barriers against ordaining homosexuals as rabbis.
   But homosexual rabbis would be warned about dangers of making
their sexual preference public.
   Reform Judaism, with 1.5 million members nationwide, would be
the first U.S. Jewish branch to take allow homosexual rabbis.
   Adoption of the new ordination guidelines would go against
traditional Jewish emphasis on procreation and aversion to
homosexuality, dating to pre-biblical times.
   The proposal was drafted by a committee of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, representing the nation's 1,560
Reform rabbis, after four years of study, hearings and debate.
   Rabbi Joseph B. Glaser, the conference's executive vice
president, said Friday he expects the proposal to be approved
during the group's convention June 24-28 in Seattle.

   China's political repression hasn't altered the shift schedule
for workers making Barbie doll accessories near Canton, McDonnell
Douglas jetliners outside Shanghai or Jeep Cherokees in Beijing.
   But for other American businesses, ranging from defense
contractor Grumman Corp. to tourism outfits like Lindblad Travel,
the consequences of the year-old crackdown on dissent have been
disappointing or worse.
   Their experiences show the mixed impact of the crushed Tiananmen
uprising on the hundreds of U.S. companies and investors that have
sought a foothold in the world's most populous nation since it
emerged from isolation a decade ago.
   ``China has always been difficult to generalize about. It's a
huge place,'' said Jerome Alan Cohen, a China specialist in the
Hong Kong office of the international law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind
Wharton &amp; Garrison.
   ``Trade continues to go up, investment is plainly down,'' said
Cohen, whose firm advises American and other foreign clients. ``You
have fewer new projects coming into the pipeline. The results are
only gradually becoming apparent.''
   Other U.S-China specialists and business executives generally
agree the combination of a political chill and a severe economic
decline have made the country a more difficult place for foreign
companies the past year.
   Many pending deals have stalled or unraveled, new investment has
tumbled and the long-term outlook for improvement remains unclear.
American visitors have slowed to a trickle.
   U.S.-Chinese commercial relations warmed somewhat on May 24,
when President Bush extended China's most-favored-nation trading
status for a year.
   The move, aimed at protecting $18 billion in two-way trade, was
welcomed by U.S. farmers, toymakers and textile importers who stood
to suffer had Bush done otherwise.
   American business attitudes toward China have hardened
nevertheless. Any illusions that American entrepreneurs may have
harbored about the potential of this market of a billion consumers
were shattered by last June's violence.
   ``No one is saying, `Hey, China, there's something we haven't
looked at yet,''' said Richard Brecher, manager of the investor
advisory program for the United States-China Business Council, a
Washington-based group that promotes American business interests in
China.
   At the same time, Brecher said, ``I think there's a sense among
most of the business community that we're dealing with a
transitional government. It's a matter of holding on now,
weathering the storm.''
   No U.S. company operating in China before June has departed.
Many say that after a short-lived disruption a year ago, their
operations there are normal or close to it.
   At Mattel's two factories in southern Guangdong Province, for
example, output of Barbie accessories, Disney items and preschool
products accounts for about 20 percent of the toy giant's business,
spokesman Glenn Bozarth said.
   Although the company could have switched production to other
factories in Malaysia, Mexico or Europe under an emergency
contingency plan last June, he said, ``we didn't invoke that
because there wasn't a need.''
   At McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s operation near Shanghai, where
Chinese workers assemble MD-80 jetliners, the production schedule
recently was extended by 20 aircraft. The operation, one of China's
largest manufacturing ventures with a U.S. company, began in 1985
with a long-term contract to assemble 25 MD-80s.
   ``The fact is China has a very large requirement for
airplanes,'' said Donald Hanson, spokesman for the company's
Douglas Aircraft subsidiary. As for the political mood in the
country, ``I don't think I can say it's had any major impact,'' he
said.
   But some other high-profile ventures have slowed down. Chrysler
Corp. has been forced to scale back the production schedule at its
Jeep assembly plant in the Chinese capital, largely because of
China's economic austerity controls, spokeswoman Karen Stewart said.
   ``We haven't gone backwards, but haven't gone forward as much as
we would have liked,'' she said. ``With China, our policy is, we're
there to stay for the long haul. You reach ebbs and flows.''
   Grumman Corp. suffered when China scrapped a $256.8 million
contract to modernize Chinese jet fighters with equipment built by
the defense contractor.
   The mid-May cancellation was an indirect result of the Bush
administration's suspension of military sales to the country last
year. Still, said company spokesman Weyman B. Jones, Grumman
remains a partner in a joint venture near Shanghai that plans to
produce 500 fire trucks a year.
   Last year, U.S. companies signed 268 contracts for joint
ventures and other projects, 43 more than a year earlier. But
practically all 1989 contracts were completed before June and new
ventures definitely have stalled.
   ``Between June and December, clearly there was a downturn,''
said Charles J. Conroy, a partner at Baker &amp; McKenzie, a law firm
that represents many businesses with interests in China.
   Conroy said some American companies have since begun to quietly
explore new opportunities in China. But, he said, ``they're not
megabillion-dollar investments like new airports or port
infrastructure.''
   Perhaps the biggest U.S. business victims of the past year have
been tour operators. Most were overwhelmed by cancellations last
summer, their busiest time of year, and face another dismal summer
this year.
   United Airlines and Northwest Airlines, the two U.S. carriers to
China, have both cut flights to one a week because of slack demand.
   ``The reason why people aren't going is not because they're
afraid. It's moral indignation about what happened there,'' said
Lars Eric Lindblad, whose Lindblad Travel company pioneered
large-scale U.S. tours to China but folded in October, partly the
result of mass cancellations.
   Lindblad nevertheless plans to lead a 484-passenger Ocean Cruise
Lines tour to China on June 21, the first big U.S. vacation group
to visit the country since the Tiananmen uprising. He said the tour
is fully booked.
   Other tour operators said they've picked up some China business,
mostly for the fall. Many expect tourism to resume in earnest
eventually, but most are still smarting from the wallop they
received a year ago.
   ``The group business just dropped. Everyone canceled,'' said
Patricia Cunneen, head of EastQuest, a small New York-based travel
concern that specializes in adventurous trips to Asia.
   Although her company survived, she said, ``A lot of businesses
have closed. They call it the Tiananmen massacre here.''

   When Mikhail Bernstam taught economics in
Leningrad 20 years ago and expressed some distinctly non-Marxist
ideas, his colleagues gave him puzzled, worried looks.
   ``My friends barely understood me. They thought I was crazy,''
says Bernstam, now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on the
Stanford University campus.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's post-summit visit Monday to
Hoover, a longtime bastion of anti-Communism, will give Bernstam
the chance, finally, to offer his ``crazy'' notions to a more
receptive countryman.
   Bernstam and five other scholars at Hoover _ the think tank that
spawned the economic principles and some key figures in the Reagan
and Bush administrations _ will offer papers to Gorbachev
suggesting ways of solving the Soviet Union's enormous economic
problems.
   If Gorbachev is coming to Stanford for advice and San Francisco
for business, he'll find plenty of people eager to accommodate him
_ though more than a few are skeptical of the success of his reform
program.
   The academic and corporate communities playing host to Gorbachev
expect him to make a strong pitch for support in converting the
Soviet economy to a free-market system.
   The visit has charged the Bay area with a Super Bowl atmosphere,
sending corporate executives scrambling for a chance to dine with
him at a business luncheon _ some willing to pay thousands of
dollars for a ticket.
   Fifteen companies co-sponsoring the event are paying $2,000 for
two seats each, and up to $500 for additional seats. Labor leaders
are complaining they may be left out.
   Phone lines are jammed at the Soviet consulate, Stanford, the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and City Hall. T-shirts with
Gorbachev's image and tackier souvenirs _ a ``Communist Party
Animal'' T-shirt _ already are on sale, and billboards are planned
to welcome the Soviet leader in the city and on the highways.
   ``This may even exceed the Super Bowl,'' predicted Stanford
spokesman Joel Shurkin, who said the university had been bombarded
with requests by 5,000 reporters to cover Gorbachev's speech at the
1,700-seat Memorial Auditorium.
   A lottery is planned to determine who gets to go, with
preference to Stanford faculty and students.
   Silicon Valley is experiencing a ``Gorbasm,'' said Mark Muchnik,
president of Global Development Corp., who has organized a Soviet
Silicon Summit to encourage high-tech trade between the countries.
   Raisa Gorbachev's planned visit to an Oakland-based program that
helps Soviet children doomed by heart defects, and the possibility
that she'll visit some of the area's big tourist attractions, has
sparked more excitement.
   ``Lots of people have invited her ... institutions, hospitals,
homes,'' said Charlotte Mailliard Swig, San Francisco's chief of
protocol.
   Armenians, Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians are planning
protests, some coming from hundreds of miles away to register
complaints about Soviet policies.
   Gorbachev's audience at the luncheon in San Francisco will be
with executives of 150 major companies in California, Washington
and Oregon. At his request, the companies will represent a variety
of industries _ telecommunications, computers, agribusiness, food
processing, construction, oil, banking, hotels and tourism.
   Gorbachev's aides chose the companies from a list submitted by
the Chamber of Commerce, which is co-host of the luncheon with
Mayor Art Agnos and California Gov. George Deukmejian.
   ``The Soviets have an interest in positioning the Asian part of
their country as a Pacific Rim player,'' said Carol Piasente,
spokeswoman for the Chamber of Commerce. ``The purpose of this
luncheon is to build a relationship between the West Coast
companies and the Far Eastern part of the Soviet Union.''
   Executives of some companies with longstanding ties to the
Soviet Union, including AT&amp;T, BankAmerica, Hewlett-Packard and
Chevron, will attend the luncheon.
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said the Soviets have ``a desperate
need'' for computers, fax machines, modems and other high-tech
office equipment that are attracting them to Silicon Valley. And
the interest is mutual.
   ``We are very concerned about losing one of the largest markets
we'll ever see,'' said Campbell, who fears European and Asian
companies will swoop in on the Soviets if American firms move too
slowly.
   ``I don't see any risk to our defense and I do see economic
benefits. One of the great dreams is we'll be so integrated
economically that nobody would benefit from an attack,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's visit is ``more than a public relations gesture,''
said Bill Johnston, Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard's director of
international planning and administration. ``He is clearly wooing
the West, and certainly this area. He's trying to get his economy
squared away and attract U.S. manufacturing expertise to the Soviet
Union.''
   Hewlett-Packard has had an office in Moscow for 18 years, and
last week joined four other U.S. companies in a consortium with
three Soviet health and medical research ministries.
   ``There are a lot of problems,'' Johnston said. ``The currency
is a major issue. There is still considerable political and
economic uncertainty, and the two are interlocked. They have a mess
on their hands.''
   To help Gorbachev clean up the mess, Hoover scholars will offer
their ideas and willingness to join with Soviet officials to
reshape the country.
   The one-page summaries offered to Gorbachev, who was lured to
Hoover by former Secretary of State George Shultz, are written in
Russian and will be followed by longer papers for his aides.
   ``We don't want to be so presumptive to suggest that we want to
tell him how to run his country,'' said Hoover Director John
Raisian. ``But we want to be cooperative and be prepared to have an
offer (of assistance) ready if we were welcomed to have one.''

<HEAD>Baltic Tensions Hang Over Summit Like a Cloud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Baltic cloud hangs over the U.S.-Soviet
summit as pressure builds on Lithuania to suspend its declaration
of independence and return, at least temporarily, to the Soviet
fold.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush, both
hopeful of making progress on arms control and other issues, may
find the Baltics a needling irritant when they begin a four-day
summit Thursday.
   But Gorbachev may be moving to disperse what Bush calls ``a
cloud of tension'' over the three Baltic republics' proclamations
of independence.
   If Gorbachev succeeds, the summit forecast could be much sunnier.
   Late last week, Gorbachev said that if Lithuania suspended its
March 11 declaration he would lift his punishing economic embargo
and even compensate Lithuanians for its damage.
   The Soviet president also offered a road map for Lithuanian
independence, saying it could be achieved under Kremlin rules
within two years, three years earlier than he had said previously.
   In a meeting with Lithuanian lawmakers in Moscow, Gorbachev did
not repeat his previous insistence that independence be sought only
under the terms of a Soviet secession law.
   That law, which Baltic leaders dub ``the law to prevent
secession,'' permits independence only after a five-year
cooling-off period.
   But Gorbachev paired last week's carrot with a heavy stick,
vowing to impose direct presidential rule on Lithuania if the
independence declaration was not suspended.
   If he imposed presidential rule, Gorbachev could disband
Lithuania's parliament, its first freely elected legislature in 50
years, replace the Lithuanian government with Moscow-appointed
officials, and impose martial law.
   The Lithuanian parliament has so far offered only to suspend the
effect of laws to implement independence and has adamantly refused
to freeze the independence declaration itself.
   Baltic-Americans will use the summit to dramatize the cause of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, all of which lost their independence
in a 1940 secret deal between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler.
   A rally is planned in Lafayette Park across from the White House
before Gorbachev's arrival. One Lithuanian group will demonstrate
outside the Soviet Embassy. Another will conduct a candlelight
vigil there. Two mass demonstrations are planned on the steps of
the Capitol.
   Bush acknowledged last week that the independence crisis
``certainly puts some tension on the summit'' and said he was
``unhappy about the state of play in the Baltics.''
   But Bush has also said repeatedly that his discussions with
Gorbachev on nuclear arms control are too important to be derailed.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said recently the
independence crisis does cast a long shadow. But he says the
administration is determined to prevent the summit's eclipse.
   ``There is too much at stake ... to dismiss cavalierly the
potential for progress'' in U.S.-Soviet relations, Baker said.
   The euphoria that flared from Baltic ex-patriots worldwide when
Lithuania issued its ringing declaration of independence evaporated
in the warning rumble of Soviet tanks through the streets of
Vilnius and in Gorbachev's orders to slow to a trickle the flow of
oil and natural gas into the republic.
   But the Soviet economic embargo did not discourage the thirst
for independence there or in neighboring Latvia and Estonia.
   The Estonian parliament on March 30 branded the Soviet Union an
occupying power and vowed to restore full independence over time.
   On May 4, the Latvian parliament followed suit, declaring
independence while trying to avoid an outright clash with Moscow by
postponing the effective date pending completion of negotiations.
   Baltic leaders have contended that agreeing to Gorbachev's
original demand that they seek independence under Soviet law would
be to concede their incorporation into the Soviet Union was legal
in the first place.
   ``Admitting that we must quit the Soviet Union under Soviet law
would be to lose our most important asset, our status as an
occupied country,'' said Tunne V. Kelam, chairman of the Council of
Estonia, the executive committee of Estonia's independent
parliament.
   ``When you are raped and robbed, you cannot ask for legal
divorce; you were never married,'' Kelam said in an interview
during a recent U.S. visit.
   The three Baltic republics have long been known in conservative
circles in the United States as ``the captive nations.'' Outside
the Baltic-American community, the most intense domestic pressure
on Bush to embrace the independence cause has come from this
direction.
   Bush and Baker have voiced a double-edged policy toward the
Baltics:
   _Over 50 years, the United States has never recognized the
forced incorporation of the three republics into the Soviet Union.
It does not do so now.
   _But the United States will not extend formal diplomatic
recognition until those republics control their own territory,
institutions and political destiny.
   With a high-stakes agenda before him, Bush decided not to impose
sanctions against the Soviets to make Gorbachev pay a price for his
embargo against Lithuania.
   Upset by that decision, the Senate on May 2 voted 73-24 to put
Bush on notice that congressional approval of a new U.S.-Soviet
trade agreement prized by Moscow is unlikely until the embargo is
lifted and talks begin on Lithuanian independence.
   Kazimiera Prunskiene, an economist and Lithuania's elected prime
minister, said repeatedly during a U.S. visit last month that the
West held the key to independence.
   Her prescription: Increase economic and political pressure on
Gorbachev to free the Baltic republics while at the same time
encouraging the democratic reforms fostered by Gorbachev's glasnost
(openness) and perestroika (economic restructuring).
   A democratized Soviet Union, she reasons, will not cling to
formerly independent nations annexed against their peoples' will.
   Dmitri Simes, an exiled Soviet scholar who is a senior associate
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, contends the
real choice Gorbachev faces is not between perestroika and
Lithuanian independence but between building Soviet democracy and
saving the vast and rickety Soviet domain.
   But many Western leaders fault Lithuania for moving too rapidly,
for giving fuel to Gorbachev's conservative opposition.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois
Mitterrand have urged Lithuania to suspend its declaration of
independence and follow the dictates of the Soviet independence law.
   The Bush administration has all but endorsed this approach,
nudging the Baltic republics to accept it.
   Gorbachev told Baker in Moscow earlier in the month that
domestic pressures are such that he does not have ``a lot of room
to maneuver'' on the Baltic crisis.
   There the stalemate stands.
   Vytautas Landsbergis, the president of the Lithuanian
parliament, urged his countrymen last week to hold on and to
survive ``as though we were in a surrounded fortress.''
   Meanwhile, he and the leaders of Latvia and Estonia have
appealed to Bush and Gorbachev ``to take our problems into their
hearts'' as they view the world from the summit's heights.

   This summer's movie season is so competitive
that film studios have been juggling release dates as if they were
auditioning for the circus.
   With Madonna as a co-star and cameos by such stars as Dustin
Hoffman and James Caan, ``Dick Tracy'' is the most hyped summer
extravaganza. But it's going up against such probable hits as
``Total Recall,'' the science-fiction adventure starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger, one of the movie industry's biggest box-office
draws, and ``Back to the Future III,'' the last in the Michael J.
Fox trilogy.
   There are other eagerly anticipated summer movies as well:
``Another 48 HRS.,'' sequel to the Eddie Murphy-Nick Nolte cop
caper; Tom Cruise's car racing movie, ``Days of Thunder''; and
``Die Hard 2,'' a sequel to the Bruce Willis thriller.
   ``Total Recall,'' directed by Paul Verhoeven, whose most recent
smash was 1987's futuristic thriller ``Robocop,'' was once set to
open against ``Dick Tracy'' on June 15. Now it will debut June 1.
``Back to the Future III'' opened Friday to good reviews.
   ``Dick Tracy,'' starring and directed by Warren Beatty, will see
whether audiences staggered by last summer's ``Batman'' are ready
for another film inspired by a comic book. It also remains to be
seen if Beatty, who has made only two movies in nine years, is a
box-office draw. The Walt Disney Co.'s fortunes for the season are
riding on ``Dick Tracy'' as well as the sci-fi ``Arachnophobia,''
``Ducktales _ The Movie'' and the reissue of the classic ``Jungle
Book.''
   ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' stand-up comic Andrew Dice
Clay's portrayal of a rock 'n' roll detective, originally slotted
for a May and then a June premiere, won't arrive until July.
Paramount Pictures moved ``Another 48 HRS.'' from June 27 to June
8, switching places with the studio's delayed ``Days of Thunder.''
   Studio distribution executives worry 23,000 domestic screens
aren't enough for all this summer's titles, which include about 40
major releases. And some wonder whether all the commotion is really
worth it.
   ``It is not a good thing to rush films to the screen,'' said
Robert Zemeckis, the director of ``Back to the Future Part III,''
which had been set to open Friday by Universal Pictures for more
than a year.
   Universal considers the Memorial Day weekend, traditionally a
heavy movie-going weekend, to be one of the best spots to launch a
film with this much anticipation.
   Summer moviegoers have a tremendous choice, from the Mel
Gibson-Goldie Hawn romantic adventure-comedy ``Bird on a Wire,''
which opened May 18 to good box office but mixed reviews, to David
Lynch's ``Wild at Heart,'' opening Aug. 24, which won the top prize
at the recent Cannes Film Festival.
   ``I think it's going to be a little wilder and a little woolier
this summer,'' said Sid Ganis, president of Paramount's motion
picture group. ``There are lots of big, good summer films opening
this year.''
   While most of the season's movies probably won't send critics
scurrying for superlatives, the bumper crop is among the costliest
ever. ``Total Recall'' cost a reported $60 million. ``Die Hard 2,''
with Willis trying to rescue his wife in an airport, reportedly
burned up just a few dollars less.
   ``Days of Thunder,'' dubbed by some ``Top Car'' because it seems
to resemble ``Top Gun,'' has raced through $50 million.
   With so much money being thrown at the screen in so few weeks,
it's certain that several high-ticket movies will unspool to mostly
empty houses. Will the busts include ``Robocop 2,'' ``Gremlins 2:
The New Batch,'' ``Flight of the Intruder'' or ``Fire Birds,''
which opened Friday to poor reviews? Or will these take off,
leaving other efforts in their wake?
   If there are any sure bets this summer _ and there aren't many,
according to studio insiders _ they include ``Days of Thunder,''
``Another 48 HRS.,'' ``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total Recall'' and ``Back to
the Future Part III.''
   A lot of prognosticators are keen on Beatty's ``Dick Tracy,''
but others aren't convinced the 53-year-old ``Ishtar'' veteran
still has the directorial talent he showed in ``Reds,'' or the
appeal he had years ago in ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Shampoo.''
   According to an informal poll of studio executives, possible
summer sleepers include ``Presumed Innocent,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Problem
Child'' and ``Arachnophobia.''
   Disney, which has appended the new Roger Rabbit short ``Roller
Coaster Rabbit'' to ``Dick Tracy,'' hopes audiences will be
attracted to the studio's sequel-free lineup.
   ``We don't have any Roman numerals after any of our pictures,''
said Dick Cook, president of Disney's Buena Vista Pictures
Distribution.
   To promote ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' 20th Century Fox
will run trailers for the film with ``Die Hard 2,'' which opens
July 4.
   The strategy, said Tom Sherak, president of domestic marketing
and distribution for Fox, is to make Clay a more familiar face in
Middle America. ``As the studios come up with better and better
films, the pressure on the marketing and distribution people has
never been greater,'' Sherak said.
   Si Kornblitt, Universal's executive vice president of worldwide
marketing, said opening Bill Cosby's ``Ghost Dad'' opposite ``Days
of Thunder'' might not be as masochistic as it looks. ``It takes
guts to go against Tom Cruise, but we think we've got the picture
to do it,'' he said.
   ``Ghost Dad,'' directed by Sidney Poitier, stars Cosby as a
corporate father who spends more time in the office than at home.
He drowns and then spends a few days looking for his body while
putting together a merger and visiting his children.
   Taking a cue from Disney's move last summer of pitting ``Honey,
I Shrunk the Kids'' against ``Batman,'' Universal hopes the family
theme of ``Ghost Dad'' will appeal to audiences not so keen on car
racing or Schwarzenegger's muscles.
   The action-adventure glut may benefit Samuel Goldwyn Co., whose
``Wild at Heart'' might offer relief to audiences shell-shocked
from a summer of exploding bodies and car chases.
   ``There is an appetite driven by `Robocop,' `Gremlins' and `48
HRS.' for a distinctive offering _ a film that is neither a sequel
nor a generic copy,'' said Tom Rothman, Goldwyn's head of worldwide
production. He said just as TV viewers tuned into David Lynch's
``Twin Peaks'' because they were weary of network drivel, movie
patrons should flock to Lynch's offbeat look at two young lovers on
the road.
   Last summer was the richest in Hollywood history, with more than
$2.04 billion worth of tickets sold from Memorial Day through Labor
Day. The 1989 summer was exceptional because in an era of $6
tickets, admissions were up to more than 456 million, an increase
of 40 million tickets from the previous summer.
   Five of last summer's films _ ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade,'' ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids'' and ``Ghostbusters II'' _ made more than $100 million
apiece, with ``Batman'' becoming the fifth most popular film in
movie history.
   This summer could top last year's.
   ``We think this summer on paper looks like it's going to be
huge,'' said Greg Rutkowski, vice president of West operations for
AMC Theatres, the nation's second-largest theater chain.
   ``The feeling in our company is it's going to be every bit as
big as last summer. And we don't think business will be limited to
four or five films as it was last summer.''

   The first time Raisa Gorbachev met Barbara
Bush, the two were sharing a limousine during the rush of events
that surrounded the 1987 Washington summit between President Reagan
and Raisa's husband, Mikhail.
   Mrs. Gorbachev apparently had been briefed that the wife of the
then-vice president was a white-haired, grandmotherly homemaker.
   ``Oh, Barbara, I have to share with you a wonderful recipe for
blueberry pie,'' Mrs. Gorbachev, a doctor of philosophy, told her
hostess, the best known dropout from the Smith College Class of '47.
   The Soviet visitor described a rudimentary recipe that sounded
as if it came from a script. Barbara Bush listened, then asked
skeptically, ``Raisa, do you cook at home?''
   ``Well, yes, sometimes, I do,'' replied Mrs. Gorbachev.
   ``Well, I never cook at home so let's talk about something
else,'' said Mrs. Bush, and the two women proceeded to converse in
a more relaxed _ and less stilted _ fashion.
   The anecdote, which Mrs. Bush herself enjoys telling, makes two
points:
   _Raisa Gorbachev, ever the Marxist lecturer, tries to do her
homework before she comes to a summit.
   _Barbara Bush is never at a loss for words, and no one, however
high or mighty, is immune from her wit.
   The two first ladies will share the spotlight with their
husbands Thursday when Bush welcomes Gorbachev to the White House.
The wives will repair to the private residence for tea while their
husbands talk in the Oval Office. That evening, the Bushes will
play host to the Gorbachevs at a black-tie dinner.
   Friday, the first ladies will fly to Wellesley College in
Massachusetts, where both will address the school's commencement.
That night, the Gorbachevs will be hosts for the Bushes for dinner
at the Soviet Embassy.
   Saturday, the women probably will accompany their husbands to
Camp David, the presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains 75
miles away. Sunday, the Gorbachevs will fly to Minneapolis, where
she will visit with a middle-class family, and then to California.
   Sharing the Wellesley podium was Mrs. Bush's idea. She tendered
the invitation long before 150 seniors signed a petition
questioning her selection as commencement speaker.
   The seniors challenged the wisdom of honoring ``a woman who has
gained recognition through the achievements of her husband.''
   Prominent feminists responded that they had no quarrel with the
way Mrs. Bush chose to lead her life. Mrs. Bush herself called it
``no big deal. Even I was 20 once.''
   Barbara Bush, 64, is a publisher's daughter from Rye, N.Y., who
dropped out of college in 1944 to marry her teen-age sweetheart,
George, a Navy pilot and war hero. She followed him to Yale and
then Texas for a life in the oil fields.
   Apart from a wartime summer job in a bolt factory and a
part-time stint at the Yale Co-op, Mrs. Bush devoted herself to
home and family, raising five children _ a sixth, daughter Robin,
died of leukemia when she was 3 years old _ and holding the family
together through 29 moves in her husband's peripatetic career in
business, politics and diplomacy.
   A lifelong volunteer, she adopted literacy as her personal cause
when Bush became vice president in 1981. Since he was elected
president 16 months ago, she has spoken out on the plight of AIDS
victims but has avoided delivering her views in public on abortion
and other controversial issues.
   Her down-to-earth ways, her obvious love of family, her
full-size figure and her white hair have all endeared her to
Americans across the political spectrum.
   Raisa Gorbachev, 58, is the Siberian-born daughter of a railway
worker. She attended the Soviet Union's top academic institution,
Moscow State University, where she met her future husband, a law
student who lived in the same hostel.
   While her husband rose through the party ranks, she taught
school and wrote a pioneering, sociology-like dissertation on life
in rural Stavropol's collective farms. The Gorbachevs are known to
have a daughter, who is a physician, and are believed to also have
a son.
   When Gorbachev became the Communist Party's agriculture
secretary in 1978, she joined the philosophy faculty at Moscow
State. She stepped down when her husband became the party's general
secretary in 1985.
   Strong-willed and stylish _ the British press once dubbed her
``Soviet realism's answer to Princess Diana'' _ she has been in the
public eye far more than the wives of past Soviet leaders. While
the coverage of her foreign trips has been far less extensive at
home than abroad, her penchant for finer living has aroused some
enmity. One of her husband's best-known opponents, maverick Boris
Yeltsin, even criticized her in a 1987 speech to party leaders.
Soon thereafter, Yeltsin was stripped of his party office.
   However Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Gorbachev get along, their relations
will likely be better than those between Nancy Reagan and the
Soviet first lady.
   The Nancy-Raisa feud was played out in soap opera fashion at
summits whenever they met _ and once when they didn't. Mrs.
Gorbachev showed up unexpectedly in Reykjavik, Iceland, for the
hurriedly called 1986 summit while Mrs. Reagan, who had been told
her counterpart would not come, stayed home.
   On her 1987 visit to Washington, Mrs. Gorbachev kept the Reagan
White House guessing about her schedule. Mrs. Reagan had trouble
pinning her down for a White House tour, and when she did come, she
described the presidential mansion as more of ``a museum of
American history'' than ``a regular house.''
   In Moscow during the June 1988 summit, Mrs. Reagan described her
testy relationship with Mrs. Gorbachev as a ``Mexican standoff.''
   In her 1989 memoirs, ``My Turn,'' Mrs. Reagan wrote: ``My
fundamental impression of Raisa Gorbachev was that she never
stopped talking. Or lecturing, to be more accurate.''
   As part of the Gorbachevs' tour of the United States, he is said
to be trying to set up a breakfast meeting with Reagan in San
Francisco. Whether Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev would join their
husbands isn't known.

   Never let it be said that the swine
industry lacks a sense of showmanship.
   The 1990 World Pork Expo will boast a ``Squeal of Fortune''
game, a ``Pig-Casso'' art show, pig races and exhibitions of
Chinese swine with skin more crumpled than a commuter's suit on a
steamy day.
   The show opens Saturday at the Iowa State Fairgrounds and is
expected to attract more than 100,000 visitors, including
representatives from about 60 countries, before it winds down on
June 4.
   Those forking over the $5-a-person admission fee also will have
a chance to pig out on more than 13 tons of pork to be dished out
at the Big Grill _ a barbecue pit that's almost as long as a
football field _ where about 200 volunteers will use pitchforks to
tend to the ham, ribs and pork loins.
   Organizers hope to set a record for the world's largest pork
barbecue, breaking the 12-ton mark set at last year's expo.
   This year's festivities come as hog farmers deal with concerns
that such issues as food safety and animal rights could endanger
their recently strong business.
   Pork prices are at heights last seen nearly eight years ago and
profits have been steadily rising this year, according to Dan
O'Brien, an economist at Iowa State University who specializes in
livestock markets.
   The university's monthly survey of livestock operation profits
says the most common hog farm in Iowa earned a profit of nearly $30
a head in April, compared with $12.56 a head in January.
   ``The mood of the industry has to be excited,'' says Mike
Wehler, who raises hogs near Plain, Wis., and is president of the
National Pork Producers Council, the nation's leading pork trade
group. ``We could very well be headed for an all-time record year
in terms of prices.''
   With things going so well, the industry is wary of anything that
could reverse the trend.
   ``From the producers standpoint, deterioration of the market is
the No. 1 fear,'' Wehler says.
   Two primary concerns are food safety and animal rights. Not only
are consumers asking more and more questions about the chemicals in
their food, but they also are organizing boycotts.
   Memories of last year's alar uproar that hurt apple sales and
halted use of the chemical are fresh in the minds of farmers. The
pork industry has its own memories of the nitrite scare that
plagued bacon sales a decade ago.
   ``We've all seen what can happen with demand for a product,''
Wehler says.
   In an attempt to avoid becoming a target again, the pork council
has organized a quality assurance program to encourage farmers to
adopt safe practices in the use of livestock medication and to
highlight the dangers posed by tainted feed.
   The animal rights movement also is on the mind of livestock
producers, especially as protests have spread to farm country.
   In Iowa this spring, pickets protested the treatment of animals
during an appearance of the Moscow Circus at Ames. On Mothers Day,
animal-rights activists marched outside a Des Moines dairy company
to complain that calves are separated from their mothers and
ill-treated.
   The cover of the May-June edition of PeTA News, a publication of
the Washington-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
has a picture of a pig and a headline, ``Did Your `Food' Have a
Face?''
   The World Pork Expo has scheduled a seminar on animal rights.
   ``More and more producers need to know what the issue is and
what it isn't,'' says pork council spokesman Charles Harness.
   Pork producers tend to label the issue one of ``animal care'' or
``animal welfare.''
   ``We certainly believe in the proper treatment of animals. It's
the ethical and moral thing to do,'' Harness says. ``We simply do
not agree that animals have rights equal to humans.''
   Wehler says the industry worries about ``extremists who want to
remove meat from our diet.''
   The pork council will use proceeds from the sale of raffle
tickets in its Squeal of Fortune $25,000 sweepstakes to support
efforts on behalf of producers in animal welfare, food safety and
other industry issues.
   For those who just love pigs for pigs sake, there will be a
competition for prizes in the Pig-Casso show of pig-oriented art or
a chance to gawk at the entries featuring pigs in a variety of
shapes and forms.

<HEAD>Futures Brokers Hail Electronic Trading Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Commodity brokers and their customers are the big winners in the
agreement by Chicago's giant futures exchanges to share an
electronic trading system.
   The unusual pact between the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange means the futures industry will avoid
the high costs of duplicate networks _ costs that ultimately would
be passed on to customers _ and the hassle of learning two systems.
   David Vogel, chairman of the Futures Industry Association, also
agreed with the benefit touted by the exchanges when they announced
the agreement this past Wednesday: by uniting instead of competing,
the Chicago markets stand a better chance of maintaining their
dominance of global futures trading as financial markets everywhere
move toward round-the-clock trading.
   ``It looks like 24-hour electronic trading is going to come
about and it will be multinational and competitive in nature,''
said Vogel, chief executive officer of LIT America Inc., a New York
futures trading concern.
   ``I think it's very important that Americans be competitive
here,'' he said.
   Ever since the Merc developed world currency futures in the
early 1970s, touching off a worldwide explosion of financial
futures and options products, the Chicago exchanges have seen
global access as the key to continued U.S. leadership in the
expanding marketplace.
   The problem can be boiled down to two words: time zones. Tokyo
is about 16 hours ahead of Chicago, and London is six hours ahead.
To attract business from both of those important financial centers,
the Chicago markets ideally would have to be open around the clock.
   The Board of Trade initiated a three-hour night trading session
for interest-rate futures early in 1987 to catch the opening of the
Japanese business day. The exchange has declared night trading a
success but concedes it would be impractical to keep its trading
floor open 24 hours.
   In the fall of 1987, the Merc announced a different approach. In
partnership with London-based Reuters Holdings PLC, the Merc would
create an automated trading system called Globex that would operate
when its trading floor is closed.
   Globex would enable traders around the world to buy and sell the
Merc's products _ and those of other exchanges that chose to
participate _ by tapping orders into computer terminals supplied by
Reuters. The orders would be matched by a central computer, often
called a ``black box.''
   The Board of Trade initially opposed the concept and asked
regulators to block it. But early last year the Board of Trade said
it would develop its own electronic trading system, dubbed Aurora.
   Unlike the blind trade-matching technology of Globex, Aurora's
screen would mimic a commodity trading pit and enable users to
select their trading partners. The Board of Trade contended this
was a superior concept and earmarked $25 million to develop the
system.
   But critics said Aurora would be more susceptible to trading
abuse. Many brokers, led by the Futures Industry Association,
clamored for a single system.
   Last May, the exchanges agreed to explore the possibility of a
shared system.
   ``The FIA ... from the very beginning promoted this dialogue and
made it very clear that (a single or shared system) is what they
desire,'' Vogel said.
   The agreement announced by the exchanges does not explain how
the system will be shared. But it does say Reuters will be
involved, prompting speculation it will be a black box system and
that Aurora will exist only as a name under which the Board of
Trade's products will be offered.
   The exchanges said they expect the system to be fully
operational by November.

<HEAD>Japan's Automakers: Small Step into Potentially Huge Soviet Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's motor vehicle exports to the Soviet Union
quadrupled last year, but the nation's big carmakers don't expect a
sudden breakthrough into the market even though local production
falls millions short of pent-up demand.
   The main barrier for Japanese automakers _ as it has been for
many Western businesses _ is that the Soviet ruble is not
convertible into other currencies, making it difficult to
repatriate any profits.
   Other problems include lack of repair facilities and other
infrastructure-related matters, poor coordination among
auto-related industries and outdated Soviet factories.
   But in a reflection of interest in the Soviet market, 10
Japanese automakers participated in a seven-day Japan auto industry
exhibition in Moscow in April. It was the first industrial fair
held solely by Japanese companies in the Soviet Union, said Takashi
Murakami, an official of the Japan Association for Trade with the
Soviet Union and Socialist Countries of Europe.
   Although prospects seem poor now, the Soviet market offers a
powerful lure. Demand is estimated at 4 million cars a year, but
only 1.2 million are produced. Soviet citizens wait several years
just to get on a list to buy a car and then have to wait another
year for delivery.
   Japan exported 4,561 motor vehicles to the Soviet Union last
year, up from 1,313 in 1988, according to the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association. More than 90 percent of the 1989 total
were buses and trucks.
   Japan's vehicle exports to the Soviet Union are dwarfed by its
shipments to the United States, which took 2.43 million units last
year.
   Murakami said Japan's Soviet vehicle exports will remain in the
range of 4,000 to 5,000 a year because Soviet officials are giving
higher priority to other consumer goods such as food and clothing.
   An official at Toyota, Japan's biggest automaker, said the
company exported 2,541 vehicles, including 409 passenger cars, to
the Soviet Union in 1989.
   Toyota participated in the Moscow industry exhibition in April
but did not make a specific deal, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Mazda Motor Corp., Japan's fourth-largest automaker, recently
said it will export its first cars to the Soviet Union _ 210 Mazda
323s, destined for a Soviet timber complex in Ilimsk, Siberia.
   Nissan Motor Corp., the No. 2 automaker, expects no sudden surge
of exports in the near future, but demand could be strong in the
long run, said a company official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Mitsui and Co., a big trading company which participated in the
Moscow exhibition, expects auto exports to increase gradually along
with the introduction of a market economy in the Soviet Union,
according to a Mitsui official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``It will be years before a (Soviet) individual can buy a new
foreign car, though many are wanting one now,'' said the Mitsui
official.

<HEAD>Opposite Roads for Stocks, Real Estate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The worlds of two of the nation's most popular
investments _ stocks and real estate _ are about as far apart as
they can get right now.
   The stock market has been forging ahead, reaching a succession
of record highs over the past two weeks.
   The real estate and housing markets, on the other hand, are
suffering a protracted period of weakness that extends into many
parts of the country.
   Analysts are quick to point out that this divergence is by no
means unique. In the 1970s, for example, real estate prices surged
ahead on the crest of a wave of inflation, while the stock market
languished for much of the time.
   In theory, at least, financial observers say the current
disparity could persist for a similarly long time.
   But sooner or later, many feel, ripple effects from either
market could exert an influence on the other. Just how and when
that might occur is a subject of much debate on Wall Street.
   One theory holds that slumping real estate prices and housing
starts reflect a squeeze on credit that somehow has failed to make
an impression yet on investors in the stock market, but that sooner
or later will prove impossible to ignore.
   On the opposite side of the argument, optimists say the woes of
real estate and construction may well prompt the Federal Reserve
eventually to adopt a stimulative credit policy, stoking the stock
and bond markets with fuel for further gains.
   ``A drop in construction and real estate activity cuts a wide
swath,'' said Michael Sherman, investment strategist at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``It hits almost every owner of real estate, almost every vendor
in the construction industry, and nearly every lender in the
financial markets. The only beneficiaries are those few people who
have held back before buying or building.
   ``In short, a major downturn in this area would be broadly
deflationary, and the Fed would know that.
   ``As a consequence, if the current weakness we see emerging in
construction continues and accelerates, monetary policy will have
to change. As it does, it will enhance the outlook for financial
assets.''
   Talk of that sort helped stock prices extend their spring rally
in the past week. Even with a setback on Friday, the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials rose 1.01 to 2,820.92, recording its
fourth consecutive weekly gain.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index edged up 0.16 to
193.71; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 5.29 to 453.60 and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 3.52 at 359.84.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 163.47 million shares a day,
against 175.65 million the week before.
   In the eyes of James Grant, a newsletter publisher and vocal
bear on the financial outlook, stocks look vulnerable to some of
the same problems that have hurt real estate.
   ``The stock market is a creature of credit,'' he writes in the
issue of Grant's Interest Rate Observer published Friday. ``It
cares about the Treasury market. It depends even more on the cost
and availability of business credit.
   ``The expansion of credit tends to be bullish, and the
contraction of credit tends to be bearish. In the 1980s, reckless
lenders expanded credit. In the 1990s, timid lenders will shrink it.
   ``It is only 1990, but the contraction is under way. It
therefore stands to reason that stock prices are headed lower.''

<HEAD>Boesky Puts on Show as Witness, More Dirty Details Emerge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He lied more than he could remember, got a big
tax break from cheating the stock market, kept an illegal fortune
out of government hands and bribed fellow felons with pocket change
to do his dirty laundry.
   Those were among the new details that embellished the portrait
of former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky under harsh questioning
in a Manhattan federal courtroom this past week, and he wasn't even
on trial.
   The gaunt 53-year-old inside trader, central figure in the
biggest criminal scandal in Wall Street history, premiered as a
star prosecution witness in the trial of John A. Mulheren Jr., a
former friend and Wall Street professional accused of securities
fraud.
   Boesky's first public appearance since completing a federal
prison term last month had been eagerly awaited, largely because it
finally afforded someone he'd implicated in his crimes the
opportunity to confront him.
   The faceoff between Boesky and Mulheren's attorney Thomas
Puccio, riddled with terse and acidic exchanges, provided more
drama than scriptwriters for ``L.A. Law'' could ever have
concocted. It was a defense lawyer's dream.
   Puccio spent hours seeking to skewer Boesky's moral values and
his self-portrait as a reformed, impoverished and humbled ex-baron
of the stock market who'd paid his debt to society.
   The witness admitted he'd lied repeatedly to investigators
before his plea bargain and took a tax deduction for half his $100
million insider trading settlement with the government in 1986.
   He also admitted the settlement didn't include profits he'd
earned from other insider trading, which by some estimates total
many millions of dollars.
   One of the more telling admissions came in a seemingly innocuous
detail about his life in the Lompoc federal prison camp, where he
spent two years. Asked if he'd broken any rules there, Boesky
admitted improperly paying other inmates quarters to wash his
clothes. The New York tabloid press seized on it.
   ``Boesky Cleans Up'' and ``Two-Bit Boesky'' screamed the
headlines in the New York Post. The Daily News called it ``Ivan's
Dirty Laundry.''
   Lawyers following the case said Puccio may have succeeded in
undermining Boesky's credibility, but that did not mean Mulheren
was any closer to acquittal. He faces 41 counts of securities
fraud, mail fraud and other crimes.
   ``Ultimately the question for the jury is not Ivan Boesky alone.
It's going to be government witnesses in the aggregate,'' said John
C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia Law School professor. ``I'd be very
surprised if the government rested its factual allegations on just
Boesky's say-so.''
   Stanley Arkin, a well-known defense attorney who has represented
several traders implicated in the Wall Street fraud scandal, said
federal prosecutors may have made Boesky testify early in the trial
so the jury would forget about him after a couple of weeks.
   ``When the government feels it might have a credibility problem
with a witness, they want to put him on first and get it over
with,'' Arkin said. ``It's the strategy of letting time and other
things heal the inadequacy of the lead witness.''
   Others said it was possible jurors would focus on Boesky's
performance because it was a dramatic point in an otherwise
complicated trial. Some said Boesky's admissions about his life and
his image as a squealer who cut a deal to save himself could be
quite damaging to the government's case.
   ``Boesky sounds like he's being as evasive as hell,'' said
Michael Feldberg, a New York defense attorney and former federal
prosecutor. ``It sounds like he's not being terribly candid, just
from the impression he's given. But ultimately the jury's going to
decide that.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _More signs emerged of an economy that's sluggish but not near
recession. High mortgage rates hurt home April sales in many parts
of the country, the National Association of Realtors said. But the
Commerce Department said consumer spending, a barometer of economic
health, rose moderately last month.
   _An air fare skirmish flared just as the summer travel season
got under way, good for consumers but not for the profitability of
the airline industry. Major carriers vowed to match discounts
started by United Airlines.
   _President Bush averted a major crisis with China by extending
its most-favored nation trading status, enabling the country to
sell goods in the United States at reduced tariffs. U.S. business
that depend on China trade welcomed the move, but Congressional
critics pledged to fight it, arguing that the Bush should punish
the hardline Beijing government for its crackdown on dissent.
   _The government admitted the cost of the thrift bailout could
nearly double to as much as $130 billion, which could force it to
borrow enormous amounts of money and consequently put upward
pressure on interest rates. By some estimates, the total cost of
rescuing the nation's ailing savings &amp; loans could reached $300
billion including interest.
