   The government says it plans to end its
26-year-old monopoly on television, allowing two private channels
to operate alongside the two existing official channels.
   The new channels, which should begin operating in the summer of
1992, will still be closely regulated, government spokesman Luis
Marques Mendes said Thursday.
   The government will control the length of airtime reserved for
news, educational shows and other programming, Marques Mendes said.
   The center-right government of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
Silva on Thursday said prospective broadcasters will have three
months from Jan. 2 to present their plans and two will be chosen in
June or July.
   A reform of the Portuguese Constitution in July 1989 allowed the
government to end the monopoly of the state-run Radio-Televisao
Portuguesa (RTP).
   Initial enthusiasm for the project among Portuguese and foreign
businessmen has been dampened by recent studies casting doubt on
the local advertizing market's capacity to support four channels.

Warning</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Shiseido Co., Japan's leading cosmetics maker, says
its Australian and Singapore subsidiaries are recalling six skin
care products containing an acid that one Australian researcher
linked to skin cancer.
   A Shiseido spokesman said Thursday, however, that urocanic acid
has been used worldwide for a long time and has been approved as
safe by Japan, the United States and many other governments.
   He said Shiseido does not plan to recall the products elsewhere.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
Australian government advisory on Dec. 18 urged a recall and a
gradual suspension of use of the acid, an ultraviolet absorbing
material.
   While no similar government action was taken in Singapore, he
added, the local subsidiary decided to recall the products after
local media coverage of the Australian action began to alarm
consumers.

<HEAD>Some State and Local Officials Attack Census Figures as Too Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ink was barely dry on the first official
1990 census results when the numbers came under attack from state
and local officials fearful of losing political clout and federal
dollars.
   ``I think this thing was destined to fail from day one,'' said
Mayor Jimmy Kemp of Meridian, Miss., a longtime critic of how the
headcount was run.
   He was far from the only mayor to complain that the census
overlooks many of the nation's poor living in big cities.
   The census numbers determine how many representatives each state
sends to Congress and how many federal aid dollars states and
localities receive.
   If the numbers are skewed, some states will get more than their
share of money and power while others will be shortchanged.
   Michael Darby, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs,
said Thursday he was confident the count was ``full, fair and
accurate.'' He said an analysis due next summer is designed to
checkthe accuracy.
   ``Certainly there's no valid basis for making a judgment about
an undercount or overcount at this point,'' said Darby, who
oversees the Census Bureau.
   The bureau said Wednesday that it counted 248.7 million people
in the United States as of April 1, up nearly 10 percent from a
decade ago. Sun Belt states such as California, Arizona and Florida
were the big gainers. Population grew at a far slower pace in the
industrial northern states and the Farm Belt.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, president of the National
League of Cities, said the numbers seemed ``to confirm the fears of
many city officials that significant numbers of people in their
communities were uncounted.''
   He said the figures put ``a substantial burden'' on the Census
Bureau and the secretary of commerce to prove the count was
accurate or adjust it to account for uncounted people.
   ``We have not seen anything that would convince us that there
has been a complete count in Texas,'' said John Bender, a spokesman
for the state comptroller's office. ``We are certain there was an
undercount in 1980 that cost the state at the very least $30
million a year in federal funds during the 1980s, and it appears
that there's been an undercount again in 1990.''
   ``We will assume they missed people in the state,'' said Ken
Jones an analyst with the Vermont Office of Policy Research and
Coordination.
   ``If we feel that the number missed in Vermont is consistent
with the number missed throughout the country, then we are
comfortable with that,'' he said. ``If we feel that the rural areas
were undercounted more than the urban areas, then we will take
action.''
   But California officials praised the census figures, which
showed the state's population grew 26 percent in the 1980s.
   The count released this week was significantly higher than the
preliminary figures ``and more in line with our own estimates,''
said Linda Gage of the California Finance Department. ``We are
surprised and delighted.''
   Rep. Tom Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of the House census
subcommittee, noted the overall population count was 4.7 million
people below the Census Bureau's October estimate of 253.4 million.
   ``We're saying the apparent discrepancy is cause for concern,''
Sawyer said.
   But Rep. Thomas Ridge of Pennsylvania, senior Republican on the
census subcommittee, said failure to confirm the October projection
``is not legitimate grounds for criticizing the enumeration process
itself.''
   The Census Bureau said it counted 249.6 million Americans. That
figure includes nearly 1 million Americans living abroad, who
weren't counted in 1980 and who weren't included in the October
estimate.
   More than 6,000 local governments - including the nation's 51
largest cities - filed challenges to preliminary figures released
earlier by the Census Bureau. The resolution of those local
challenges will help determine the final totals.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has until July 15 to decide
whether to add people that the local officials say were not
counted.

   The Italian Treasury is issuing a new 1,000-lire
bill with a picture of educator Maria Montessori, replacing the
traditional portrait of explorer Marco Polo.
   The old bills will eventually be phased out, the Treasury said
Thursday as it began the new issue. A thousand lire are worth about
86 cents.
   The new bills are far more colorful than the old ones, with
designs in green, yellow, blue, orange, red and blue instead of
only green and light brown.
   Montessori, a psychiatrist and educator, was born in Italy in
1870. She developed a system of preschool and elementary education
that emphasized individual initiative and creativity.

<HEAD>Administration Continues to Send Mixed Signals on Troop Readiness</HEAD>

   Could U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf go to
war 10 minutes from now? Or on Jan. 15? Or shortly after Jan. 15?
Or not until Feb. 15?
   All are prospective strike dates raised by U.S. officials in
recent days, as conflicting signals emerge from the administration
on whether and when the nation is ready and able to go to war.
   President Bush himself now says there's been enough talk about
the preparedness of U.S. forces.
   ``I've said all I want to say about readiness,'' he told
reporters Thursday during a one-day trip back to Washington from
his vacation retreat at Camp David, Md.
   ``I think it would be very useful if from the president and
others there were fewer comments about readiness.''
   Then he proceeded to talk about readiness.
   Bush sought to dispel reports, stemming originally from public
statements by the deputy U.S. commander in the gulf region, that
American forces will not be ready for offensive action until
mid-February - a month after the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United
Nations for Iraq's withdrawal from occupied Kuwait.
   ``I feel that the situation is exactly where I was told it was
going to be at this time,'' the president said. ``Don't believe
those reports you're reading,'' he said of accounts that his
military advisers are warning against launching an attack before
mid-February.
   Bush said he is ``very comfortable'' with what his aides have
told him about the preparedness of the American force, now at
300,000 and growing to 430,000. One aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the president would not be deterred from launching
a strike, if necessary, even if all U.S. troops and equipment are
not in place.
   Bush said he ``absolutely'' stood by his comment last Saturday
that U.S. and allied forces could ``respond vigorously'' on 10
minutes' notice if provoked by Iraq.
   He said his top military advisers - Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
- did not try to change his mind on that point when they briefed
him Monday on their trip to the gulf region.
   On the other hand, the president called ``too provocative'' a
question as to whether he would have any hesitation in going to war
on Jan. 15. And he never directly denied news reports quoting U.S.
officials saying the troops will not be sufficiently ready for
offensive action until weeks after the Jan. 15 deadline.
   Bush's comments came in the wake of a jumble of conflicting
statements from senior U.S. officials.
   Last Wednesday, Army Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller, second in command
of U.S. forces in Operation Desert Shield, told reporters Bush
should wait until mid-February if he wants to attack because the
troops would not be ready until then.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater then said Waller
meant the troops ``might not be as ready as they'd like to be ...
for all the contingencies.''
   The Pentagon said Cheney was ``not displeased'' by Waller's
comments. Some Pentagon officials said U.S. air power would be
fully prepared for a strike even if ground troops were not.
   Then Cheney himself said that ``soon after Jan. 15,'' the U.S.
forces would be ``in a position to take military action in
conjunction with our allies.''
   Bush entered the readiness fray on Saturday, stating that he
could launch an attack in 10 minutes.
   The varying statements caused speculation that the
administration was deliberately trying to put Iraq's Saddam Hussein
off balance. Fitzwater told reporters that, ``It never hurts to
build in a little uncertainty about what our intentions are as it
relates to Jan. 15.''
   Administration officials have stressed that Jan. 15 is not a
strike date, but merely an authorization date.
   Asked what message he wanted Saddam to get on the readiness
issue, Bush said Thursday, ``We are going to fully implement the
United Nations resolutions,'' which include one authorizing use of
force.
   A senior administration official said, meantime, it has been
decided not to talk about readiness any more.
   Asked for an indication of which of the various statements
represented the real administration position, the official said
only, ``I would take the president's comments most seriously.''
   As to Bush's statement that he could go to war in 10 minutes,
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``His is
the last word.''

   The Army is calling up a reserve unit that
recovers soldiers' bodies and arranges for their burial.
   The activation of 630th Quartermaster Company is part of
Operation Desert Shield, the Army said Thursday.
   The company, with nearly 40 soldiers, is trained to recover,
identify, evacuate and arrange interment of the bodies of U.S.
military and allied personnel, said an Army statement from Fort Sam
Houston, Texas.
   The company is to report Jan. 3 to the Army Reserve center in
New Orleans and to Fort Polk on Jan. 6.
   A Lake Charles, La.-based reserve detachment that prepares
papers for replacing soldiers in active Army units, the 221st
Adjutant General Detachment, was activated earlier this month. The
unit of about 20 soldiers is to report to Fort Knox on Monday.

<TEXT>
   This was the year the Cold War ended and NATO
and the Warsaw Pact signed the most sweeping arms-reduction treaty
in history.
   The phrase ``new world order'' gained currency in America as
well as Europe. East Germany was merged into West Germany without a
flicker of friction. Nations at odds for 45 years were
contemplating new arrangements to promote peace and prosperity.
   So much had the volatile world changed that for a while it
seemed the biggest worry in some State Department offices and
Washington think tanks was whether new uses could be found for NATO
now that U.S.-Soviet tensions had nearly evaporated and military
alliances seemed obsolete.
   As distrust dissolved, President Bush offered up to $1 billion
in food credits to the Soviet Union and other incentives for
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to weather dislocations and to keep trying to
establish a free-market economy.
   Superpower cooperation raised hope, meanwhile, of ending wars in
Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia. Arms sales around the world even
dipped a bit.
   But as 1991 draws near, the world is not necessarily a safer
place.
   Gorbachev is trying to hold on to the 15 Soviet republics by
taking on new powers that his old friend and ally, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, denounced as a step toward dictatorship.
   Shevardnadze resigned as foreign minister, shattering a smooth
relationship with Secretary of State James A. Baker III that had
promoted reconciliation between Washington and Moscow.
   Gorbachev pledged that his foreign policy would be maintained.
But that is bound to be harder to do after the resignation of one
of its chief architects and amid grumbling in some segments of the
military that the Soviets gave in too easily to German unification
and to independence in Eastern and Central Europe.
   Unrest in the republics poses an even bigger danger to world
peace.
   Some of the rebellious nationalities are reviving the hateful
chauvinism that the central government in Moscow had managed to
suppress. Disorder could provoke a heavy-handed response from
Gorbachev. He may not be able to cope with separatists on several
fronts at once. And that could lead to a splintering of the Soviet
Union and the destabilization of Europe.
   In the Persian Gulf the threat of war made the whole world
anxious.
   There is no sign of a diplomatic solution even with the approach
of the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq
to withdraw its forces from Kuwait.
   And President Bush threatens to go to war unles  all the troops
are not out by then.
   `We haven't blinked so far,'' Brent Scowcroft, his national
security adviser, said last week. ``We're not blinking now, and we
will not blink.''
   Not to be outdone in bravado, Bush said of Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein: ``If we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his
ass kicked.''
   Saddam, meanwhile, threatened to attack Israel and to use all
his resources, including chemical weapons.
   Perhaps the tough talk on both sides was simply bluster,
designed to achieve political objectives. For Bush, that would be
the liberation of Kuwait and the restoration of the ousted royal
family. For Saddam, that would be at least a piece of Kuwait and
the mobilizing of international pressure against Israel.
   On the other severely troubled front, maybe Gorbachev will be
able to get through the winter with his reconstruction program
intact and his drive toward democracy only slightly impeded by the
authoritarian measures he has taken.
   In the meantime, though, the promise 1990 held out for peace
seems more fragile with the approach of the new year.

   Salman Rushdie, under a death sentence by Iran
for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic
Verses,'' today explained his recent embrace of the Moslem faith.
   ``I am certainly not a good Moslem. But I am able now to say
that I am a Moslem,'' Rushdie wrote in a column published today in
The New York Times and The Times of London.
   Rushdie, a British citizen born in India, said he came from a
Moslem family background but wasn't raised as a believer.
   ``However ... I have been engaging more and more with religious
belief ... and religion for me has always meant Islam,'' he wrote.
   Rushdie rejected calls by Moslems to withdraw ``The Satanic
Verses'' from sale, however. ```The Satanic Verses' is a novel that
many of its readers have found to be of value. I cannot betray
them,'' he wrote.
   Rushdie, 43, has been in hiding since the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini ordered him killed in February 1989.
   Rushdie pledged Monday not to publish the novel in paperback or
in languages other than English. He also said he disagreed with the
utterances of the novel's characters. But Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Wednesday the death decree was
irreversible.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Bob Hope has come a long way on his wit and
grit, in more ways than one.
   At the age of 4, the future entertainer was a British immigrant
to America. Now a proposed family history center at Ellis Island
will be named for the 87-year-old entertainer, the Ellis Island
Restoration Commission said Thursday.
   Plans for the Bob Hope Family Heritage Center were disclosed as
Hope was winding up another Christmas visit with American troops
overseas.
   Commission spokesman Alan Prigge said Hope, reached in Saudi
Arabia, quipped, ``Sounds great, but does this make me a national
monument?''
   The center will be built with $15 million in private
subscriptions. Holding records of the 17 million immigrants who
passed through Ellis Island, it will include a computer center
where descendants can research their family ancestry.
   Opening is tentatively set for fall 1992.

   ``I've been to some of their productions, and I've liked what

``They use their money very well. I just thought I'd help them
out.''
   ``We are just absolutely delighted,'' Barbara Reifler, the GeVa
Theatre's development director, said of the Christmas gift.
   GeVa will use the annual interest on the endowment, about
$2,000, to pay musicians, Reifler said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Ed McMahon has called off his marriage to
restaurant hostess Joanna Ford.
   McMahon, 67, was to marry Miss Ford on Jan. 12 at his Los
Angeles home, his spokesman Charlie Barrett said Thursday. No
reason for the cancellation was given.
   It would have been the third marriage for McMahon and the second
for Miss Ford, Barrett said.
   McMahon is Johnny Carson's sidekick on ``The Tonight Show'' and
host of the syndicated series ``Star Search.''
   McMahon filed for divorce in 1989 after 13 years of marriage to
his second wife, Victoria. For tax reasons, the divorce was not
expected to become final until January at the earliest.

<HEAD>USDA Standing By Food Price Forecast Despite Freeze Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The freeze that hit much of the nation before
Christmas ravaged fruit and vegetable crops in California, but
Agriculture Department analysts are holding to their 1991 food
price forecast.
   Ralph Parlett Jr. of the department's Economic Research Service
said Thursday, however, that it was too soon to predict accurately
what impact the freeze will have.
   Parlett said fruit and vegetable prices will go up ``a little
more'' next year than has been predicted. Overall, he is sticking
with the agency's forecast that food prices will rise an average of
2 percent to 5 percent in 1991.
   This year, according to USDA calculations, consumer food prices
rose about 6 percent, compared with a 5.8 percent gain in 1989.
That is the sharpest back-to-back increase since an 8.6 percent
jump in 1980 and a rise of 7.8 percent in 1981.
   Parlett's comments, in a telephone interview, followed a report
by the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility that crop
damage from the cold wave during the week of Dec. 16-22 was mostly
confined to fruit and vegetables in California.
   The severe cold in California ``caused extensive damage to the
citrus and vegetable crops,'' the report said. But Arizona and
Texas crops escaped serious freeze damage, it added.
   ``Rain and snow over the eastern third of the nation provided
moisture to growing crops and delayed late harvest of corn and
soybeans,'' the report said. ``Lack of moisture in Florida resulted
in continued use of irrigation in fruit groves.''
   The weather facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports show the general effects of weather on
crops but do not foretell actual losses or production estimates.
   While the low temperatures in California damaged the citrus
crop, the report said ``damaged fruit can be processed but will be
limited by processing capacity.''
   In southern Texas, growers in the Rio Grande Valley ``reported
little damage to growing crops'' from cold weather, the report
said. However, there was some minor damage to spinach and beet
crops in the San Antonio winter garden area.
   Parlett said it appeared losses in California were mainly to
navel oranges, a valuable fruit for the fresh market. Valencias, he
said, come along later but still may have been badly hurt by the
cold.
   ``We have a big crop (of oranges) in Florida, and when we get
into the valencia season, I'm sure a lot of the Florida valencias
will be attracted away from the juice market and end up in the
fresh market,'' he said.
   As for vegetables, Parlett said lettuce prices don't need much
cold weather to trigger sharp increases. Other vegetables also may
react.
   ``This will be temporary,'' he said. ``They'll come back pretty
quick'' as growers plant new vegetable crops. ``But it's going to
have some effect.''
   In USDA's first 1991 food price forecast a month ago, retail
prices of fruits and vegetables as a group were projected to rise 1
percent to 4 percent in 1991, compared with gains of 7.5 percent in
1990, 8.5 percent in 1989 and 7.6 percent in 1988.
   Parlett, without being more specific, said the outlook for the
fruit and vegetable price index now will be ``a little more'' than
was forecast.
   The report by the weather facility said the condition of winter
wheat planted for the 1991 harvest was varied.
   ``Snow provided limited cover and moisture to Kansas wheat,'' it
said. ``Some wheat fields in south-central areas of Kansas had
serious army worm damage.''
   The wheat crop was said to be in ``mostly good to excellent
condition'' in Illinois. Snow helped provide insulation from the
cold in Montana and Oklahoma.
   ``Showers early in the week slowed the last of the corn harvest
in Michigan,'' the report said. ``The soybean harvests in South
Carolina and Georgia were almost complete. Texas' soybean harvest
was almost complete, with yields poor to average.''
   The 1990 cotton harvest was ``virtually complete'' in Arizona,
the report said. But late harvesting continued in southern
California. The Texas cotton harvest was said to be 97 percent
completed, nine percentage points ahead of normal.
   Pastures and livestock across the nation were reported ``in good
to fair condition'' as the holidays approached.
   ``Hay supplies were adequate in North Dakota, and adequate to
surplus in West Virginia,'' the report said. ``Range conditions in
the southern two-thirds of California were poor to very poor, and
poor to good in the northern third.''
   Winter pastures in Texas continued to provide adequate grazing
despite a lack of moisture, the report said.

   ABC was America's favorite network in the
latest ratings contest, thanks to Monday night football and a Dolly
Parton Christmas special.
   It was the third win of the 14-week-old season for ABC.
   The ``NFL Monday Night Football'' skirmish between the San
Francisco 49ers and the Los Angeles Rams was second with an 18.9
average rating, according to figures released Thursday by the A.C.
Nielsen Co.
   ``Dolly Parton: Christmas at Home'' was the No. 4 show. The
country singer's homespun holiday program also was this season's
highest rated 60-minute special.
   ABC won the overall network race with a 12.6 average rating. NBC
was second with 11.9, just three-tenths of a ratings point ahead of
CBS with 11.6.
   Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   The most watched show on television was a repeat of ``Cheers,''
NBC's perennial ratings winner. The beer-drinking crowd at Sam
Malone's bar also occupies the No. 1 spot for the season to date.
   The CBS news magazine ``60 Minutes'' was third.
   Olivia Newton John's portrayal of a mannequin that comes to life
in ``A Mom for Christmas'' helped NBC's ``Monday Night Movies''
land in seventh place.
   The rest of the top 10 was dominated by non-holiday fare.
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' was in fifth place, followed by NBC's ``A
Different World.''
   In a two-way tie for eighth place were CBS' ``Designing Women''
and NBC's ``The Golden Girls.''
   ``Unsolved Mysteries'' on NBC was tenth.
   ABC and Peter Jennings continued to lead the network news
contest last week with an 11.3 average rating. CBS and Dan Rather
finished second with 10.3 and NBC and Tom Brokaw were last with
9.5.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating:
   ``Cheers,'' NBC, 19; ``NFL Monday Night Football,'' ABC, 18.9;
``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 18.3; ``Dolly Parton: Christmas at Home,''
ABC, 17.8; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 17.6; ``A Different World,'' NBC,
17.5; ``Monday Night Movies: A Mom for Christmas,'' NBC 17;
``Designing Women,'' CBS, and ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC (tie),
16.3; ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' NBC, 16.2.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Sends Bush `Friendly Greeting' in Message</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev sent him a private message containing ``friendly words of
greeting'' but he and aides are mum about the details.
   ``It was just one more in what's become a series of exchanges
with the president of the Soviet Union,'' Bush told reporters after
Soviet Ambassador Alexander Bessmertnykh hand-delivered the message
Thursday.
   ``There were some very friendly words of greeting from President
Gorbachev,'' he said, giving no details. ``And I had a chance to
... ask the ambassador to give him our best wishes for a Happy New
Year.''
   Bush said he and the Soviet envoy discussed ``some of the
problems'' in the Soviet Union, a nation engulfed in a political
turmoil that resulted last week in the resignation of Gorbachev's
longtime close ally, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   A senior administration official characterized the letter as ``a
private message,'' and would not describe it further except to say
it ``is not going to change the course of human history.''
   The communication came as Gorbachev is struggling to keep his
clout and to reconcile volatile conflicts between reformers and
conservatives within the Soviet Union. At the same time, the
country is suffering severe economic problems, with shortages and
food distribution problems.
   ``They are having difficulties, economic difficulties
principally,'' Bush said Thursday. ``Difficulties in sorting out
this new federation.''
   He said those problems were to be expected with Gorbachev's
efforts to transform his nation from a totalitarian state to a more
open, market-oriented country.
   ``The main thing is, there's a determination to keep going down
this path of reform,'' he said. ``And that's very important.''
   The president said he believes the Soviets can ``sort that all
out'' themselves.
   U.S. officials are closely monitoring the tumultuous political
situation in the Soviet Union, especially as to how it might affect
U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the Persian Gulf and on pending arms
control agreements.
   The administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Gorbachev still appears ``pretty resourceful,'' and
so far has succeeded in balancing the opposing forces of reformers
and conservatives.

<HEAD>Growers Brace for More Cold; Orange Prices to Jump</HEAD>

   Navel orange prices could double nationwide
because of the deep freeze that devastated much of California's
citrus crop, an industry official says.
   Farmers, meanwhile, braced for a second arctic blast that
threatened to destroy surviving crops and the trees themselves.
   The navel orange crop in the San Joaquin Valley, the state's
main growing region, was virtually wiped out in the siege of
freezing temperatures that started Dec. 21.
   A number of vegetable crops were also damaged, including
artichokes, avocados, broccoli, cauliflower and celery. And the
cold affected the state's flower crop, forcing people working on
the Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena to use substitute
decorations.
   Joel Nelsen, manager of California Citrus Mutual, a growers
organization, estimated 15,000 workers in the state's 70 citrus
packing houses, plus an undetermined number of harvest workers,
will lose their jobs.
   Preliminary estimates put the loss at $286 million to $288
million for valley orange growers in California's worst freeze
since 1913, agriculture officials in Tulare, Kern and Fresno
counties reported.
   As a result, navel oranges will be scarce and more expensive in
supermarkets nationwide, industry officials said Thursday.
   ``Prices could double because of the severe damage in the
central valley,'' said Claire Peters, spokeswoman for Sunkist
Growers Inc., a marketing cooperative of about 6,000 California and
Arizona growers.
   ``The fruit will be well tested, so the quality should be fine,
but there won't be as much and it will be more expensive,'' she
said.
   Most of the country's eating oranges are grown in the West,
while Florida produces most juice oranges. California's central
valley produces about half of the West's navel orange crop.
   Citrus farmers in some Southern California pockets escaped with
less damage because temperatures remained a few critical degrees
higher, said Bob Perkins, manager of the Riverside County Farm
Bureau.
   ``As one farmer here said, they will make money on somebody
else's misfortune. The price of remaining fruit will rise because
of damage in the central valley,'' Perkins said Thursday.
   National Weather Service forecasters predicted a second ``Yukon
Express'' cold air mass could send the mercury plummeting again by
week's end, threatening remaining crops and the trees themselves.
   Severe cold can damage the tender fruitwood, the ends of the
twigs where fruit grows, and endanger next year's crop, Perkins
said.
   There was a midweek respite from the cold. Los Angeles and San
Diego reached 64 degrees by midday Thursday, while San Francisco
reported 49 degrees. Fresno, in the central valley, had a midday
high Thursday of 50.
   But forecasters said nights would remain chilly, dipping into
the low 20s in some valley locations even before the second arctic
blast arrives.
   Last weekend, temperatures throughout the San Joaquin Valley
citrus region dipped below 20. Navel oranges begin to sustain
damage if the temperature stays below about 26 degrees for at least
four hours.
   State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. urged homeowners to be wary of
the next cold blitz and insulate pipes. The company said 15,000
homes it insures in Northern California were damaged by water from
burst pipes during the past week.

<HEAD>Healing Is Slow And Executions Continue 25 Years After Failed Coup</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: One name only for Sukarno and Suharto.
^By KENNETH L. WHITING</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bloodbath began 25 years ago in
the waning days of what the late President Sukarno said would be a
``year of living dangerously.''
   From Sumatra to Bali there were nights of horror in city slums
and jungle clearings, a rampage in the name of anti-communism that
left hundreds of thousands dead following an unsuccessful coup in
September 1965.
   Indonesia is still dealing with the carnage and shows no real
willingness to bury the past. Much leftover business remains from
the turbulent period.
   The government recently started screening about 1.5 million
former communists or sympathizers to dcide whether they will be
allowed to vote in the 1992 general election.
   Four former palace guards were executed earlier this year for
their part in the aborted coup, which was blamed on Chinese
influence. At least six more prisoners await the firing squad.
   Diplomatic relations with China, suspended since 1967, were
restored only four months ago. Still to be settled is the issue of
more than 300,000 Chinese made ``stateless'' when they were unable
to renew their passports or leave Indonesia when relations were
frozen.
   Two books about the aborted coup were banned this year. One of
them ``The United Stats and the Overthrow of Sukarno,'' by Peter
Dale Scott of the University of California, Berkeley, alleged that
President Suharto helped instigate the uprising.
   The memory of that brutal chapter still haunts the country's
leaders who are anxious to ensure that the next transfer of power
is peaceful. Suharto, 69, is halfway through his fifth five-year
term. Diplomats and other analysts assume he will continue for
another term if his health remains good.
   No conclusive account of the coup attempt that can be verified
independently has been issued. A government ``white paper'' with an
official version was completed in the 1970s but never released.
   What is known is that it started on Sept. 30, 1965 with an
uprising by a group of middle-rank army officers. The government
says they were backed by the Chinese-influenced Indonesian
Communist Party, then the world's third-largest, claiming 20
million followers.
   They struck first by murdering six leading generals but were
unable to seize power. The coup was put down within 36 hours by
troops led by then Maj. Gen. Suharto, whom the plotters
inexplicably left off their hit list.
   As head of the strategic reserve command, he was more important
than most of the generals who were killed.
   There was popular resentment at the slaying of the generals and
Moslem anger at a power grab by infidels, but the country remained
calm at first. For several weeks a semblance of order was
maintained.
   Then something snapped. By late October the official Antara news
agency was reporting massacres in Central and East Java. Religious
and racial tensions exploded, with ethnic Chinese singled out for
the settling of old scores. The Moslem majority had long envied the
Chinese for their wealth and questioned their patriotism.
   As months of frenzy passed, the purge of anyone labeled a
communist came to be considered a national obligation, not murder.
   Officials announced in 1975 that from 450,000 to 500,000 people
were killed. Tens of thousands were injured.
   An estimated 600,000 suspects were detained without charge,
among them some of the country's best known writers, poets,
educators, journalists, film directors and intellectuals. The last
detainees were released in 1979.
   When calm was restored in March 1966, Sukarno relinquished
executive power to Suharto and the army, a situation that prevails
25 years later.
   Sukarno's downfall and outlawing of the Indonesian Communist
Party led to a reversal of a leftist, pro-China foreign policy and
adoption of a pro-Western course.
   Suharto halted a costly two-year war with neighboring Malaysia
that had divided the armed forces. Jakarta helped found the
anti-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   The catchy acronyms and slogans that spiced Sukarno's oratory
ended when he went into virtual house arrest until his death in
1970. Among the best known slogans, thanks to a novel by C.J. Koch
and movie based on it, was Sukarno's forecast that 1965 would be a
``year of living dangerously.''
   Once hailed for his vision of a unified nation free of Dutch
colonial rule, his economic policies left the country near
bankruptcy by the time he died.
   Only the second president in 45 years of independence, Suharto
has brought stability and economic progress to the country of 180
million at the expense of political freedom - a tradeoff most
Indonesians appear to accept.
   He has largely succeeded in ending most of the regional,
religious and political factionalism that wracked the country
during its first 20 years and threatened to tear apart the
13,677-island archipelago.
   The country's economic policies, praised by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank, are bearing fruit. Last year's
growth rate was 7.4 percent.
   But Indonesia must find jobs for a work force that grows by 2.5
million people each year. Per capita gross national product was
only $500 last year.

   Subscribers to a nationwide computer
network contend the owners are taking a byte out of the First
Amendment by censoring the network's electronic bulletin board
messages.
   But officials for the Prodigy network, which provides consumer
and information services to several hundred thousand subscribers,
maintain they have the same right as newspaper and broadcast
executives to ``set boundaries'' on the exercise of free
expression.
   An electronic communications law expert agreed, saying the
challenge for Prodigy is enforcing standards tough enough to avoid
lawsuits sparked by bulletin board content.
   ``They should be able to forbid ... whatever they forbade in
their subscriber agreement,'' Dallas attorney Benjamin Wright said
Thursday.
   But subscriber indignation has been flowing for weeks into the
electronic bulletin board Prodigy sets aside for complaints.
   ``Censorship is the most un-American, communist thing in the
Prodigy service,'' wrote subscriber Chris Hanke, who did not say
where he lives. ``If a member finds anything offensive (on the
bulletin boards) this service should ask them if they still want to
be a member of this service.''
   Subscriber John Gillis likened the service's editors to ``old
ladies'' afraid of mice. That drew a one-word retort from Ray
Bandel, one of the badly outnumbered subscribers who support
Prodigy's standards: ``Bull.''
   Prodigy, which carries such items as stock quotes, advertising
and horoscopes, considers itself a ``family service,'' company
spokeswoman Martha Griffin said. It is jointly owned by Sears and
IBM Corp.
   ``When you send something into a public bulletin board on a
family service, then you expect to write within the boundaries of
the rules that are stated,'' she said from her White Plains, N.Y.,
office.
   When they join, Prodigy subscribers agree to refrain from
sending messages that contain profanity or obscenity, threaten or
insult, might offend those doing business through Prodigy, or are
``otherwise objectionable.''
   Messages rejected by Prodigy editors included one seeking the
least painful way to commit suicide and another accusing somebody
of being an embezzler, said Geoffrey Moore, who directs market
programs and communications for Prodigy.
   ``The Constitution bestows no rights on readers to have their
views published in someone else's private medium,'' Moore wrote in
a Dec. 16 essay in The New York Times. ``What the Constitution does
give readers is the right to become publishers themselves.''
   But some subscribers contend the service is heavy-handed and
goes beyond its own standards. Daniel Hunter wrote that Prodigy has
rejected his messages to the Arts Club bulletin board because they
made reference to the Marquis de Sade and contained ``a historical
discussion of mass murders, plagues, etc.''
   ``If anything, our editors do err on the side of conservatism,''
Ms. Griffin said. ``There are other bulletin board services where
people can express more extreme views if they wish.''
   She also said Prodigy does not interfere with private messages
sent directly from one subscriber to another. ``The only way we
would see those messages is if the receiver complained about their
content,'' she said.
   Wright said the real issue for Prodigy and other computer
networks ``is the extent to which a video-text service provider has
an obligation to look at what's getting on the bulletin boards.''
   He noted that Soldier of Fortune magazine recently was
successfully sued by the family of a man slain by a killer-for-hire
who had advertised in the magazine.
   ``The law found that the magazine had a duty to screen the
information it published,'' he said.
   Prodigy may not have as great a duty, Wright said. That would
depend on whether a judge or jury found it to be ``more like a
newspaper or magazine, which have a greater duty to monitor content
than entities not in that business.''
   ``Where they would stand in terms of liability is unclear,'' he
said. ``There are few if any statutes or lawsuits as precedent.''

   Brittany Eichelberger is a little hoarse, her
lungs are congested and she may lose the tips of her fingers and
toes to frostbite.
   But her mother couldn't be happier.
   Doctors say the 3-year-old girl was alert and well Thursday,
three days after she was found frozen and clinically dead in a
snowdrift outside her mobile home in Elkins, W.Va.
   ``At this point, she looks pretty normal,'' said Dr. Shekhar
Venkataraman, the girl's doctor at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh, where she was in serious condition.
   Brittany was breathing and eating on her own and is expected to
be released from Children's within two weeks. It will be some time,
though, before doctors determine if there's been any brain damage,
he said.
   ``When we first took her to the hospital, I didn't think she had
a chance because she just looked so bad,'' said Brittany's mother,
Melinda Eichelberger, 20. ``Now, she's fighting with the nurses,
telling them to get away.''
   Doctors estimated the blond, blue-eyed toddler was outside for
two to three hours, dressed only in a T-shirt and underwear in
27-degree weather.
   Her body temperature dropped to 74 degrees, causing her heart to
stop - apparently minutes before her mother found her, Venkataraman
said. He said her heart probably stopped at 80 degrees.
   Without oxygen, the cold helped preserve her brain, the doctor
said.
   A neighbor, Paul Owens, began heart and lung resuscitation until
medics arrived. Doctors at Davis Memorial Hospital in Elkins
continued revival techniques for 3{ hours until Brittany's
temperature began to rise and her heart began to beat.
   Doctors also warmed the little girl immediately, both externally
with warm blankets and lights and internally with a warm saline
solution pumped into her stomach.
   She was flown to Pittsburgh on Monday evening. Her mother said
Brittany was able to speak to her on Christmas.
   ``Her voice was real hoarse, but I was excited. I was afraid she
wasn't going to be able to talk,'' Ms. Eichelberger said. ``She
says `no,' `mommy,' `get,' and `stop.' ''
   ``It was the best Christmas I've had in all these years,'' said
Ms. Eichelberger's fiance, Steve Robinson, 21.
   In Rockford, Ill., doctors Thursday decided against amputating
the frostbitten legs of a 2{-year-old girl left in a relative's car
for 17 hours on Christmas night in sub-zero weather.
   Kandy Shoulders was in fair condition at Rockford Memorial
Hospital, hospital spokeswoman Laurie Miller said. The child's
mother, Stephanie Shoulders, said she was left in her grandmother's
car by accident.
   ``I thought she was in bed at my mother's house and my mother
thought she was at my house,'' Ms. Shoulders said. ``Everybody
feels sick, but it was completely an accident.''

<HEAD>Conservatives Grade Bush Down At Midterm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's acceptance of a tax increase
was reason enough for a panel of conservatives to mark him down in
midterm grades, and one of them suggests the president might flunk
out at reelection time.
   The conservative Heritage Foundation lined up seven figures from
the right to grade Bush, his Cabinet and top aides for the
``sophomore slump'' report card. They gave Vice President Dan
Quayle better marks than Bush.
   The critique released Thursday is to be published in Policy
Review, the foundation's quarterly magazine. A year ago, in a
similar exercise, Bush got grades ranging from ``B'' to ``D.'' This
time, one rater gave him an ``F'' and three said ``D'' in judging
his domestic policy performance.
   The budget deal and tax increase were their common complaint.
   Martin Anderson, a White House adviser to Ronald Reagan who now
is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, said Bush rated a ``B
minus'' overall, and could have made ``A'' if he hadn't flunked on
the budget and economic policy.
   At the other end of the scale, Edward H. Crane, president of the
libertarian Cato Institute, gave Bush an ``F.''
   ``George Bush will go down as one of the worst presidents in
American history,'' Crane wrote. ``The Republicans were the
anti-tax party and now they are the dumb party.''
   James C. Miller III, a Reagan budget director now chairman of
Citizens for a Sound Economy, said ``D'' because of Bush's
``incredible blunder'' on taxes.
   ``His credibility has suffered a mortal blow,'' said Miller.
``Can he promise anything in the 1992 campaign without evoking
giggles from the audience?''
   Burton Yale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage
Foundation, who has suggested that conservative Republicans may
challenge Bush in the 1992 presidential primaries, also gave him a
``D'' on domestic affairs.
   ``At best, he is reactive,'' Pines said. ``At worse, he risks
being a Herbert Hoover-William Howard Taft one-term president.''
   Most of the conservative graders ranked Bush higher on foreign
policy, and his handling of the Middle East crisis, while reserving
final judgment pending the outcome of the confrontation with Iraq.
   Crane didn't agree, contending that Bush blundered by sending
troops to the Middle East, and with ``his dangerous and costly
vision of a New World Order'' involving U.S. military and economic
involvement abroad. He stuck with his ``F.''
   ``Bush's foreign policy has unraveled like a cheap Russian
sweater,'' Crane said.
   The conservative panel gave Quayle four ``A's'' and two ``B's,''
praising his loyalty to conservative tenets as well as to Bush and
saying he'd tried to talk the president out of the budget and tax
deal. But Crane said ``D-plus,'' with points off for loyalty.
   ``The vice president has proven to be a loyal team player, which
would be okay were it not for the fact that he's playing on the
Bush administration team'' Crane said.
   The conservatives gave White House chief of staff John H. Sununu
low grades. Pines marked him ``F'' for ``meekly surrendering to and
becoming an eager captive of Washington's permanent
establishment.''
   Gary L. Bauer, another Reagan adviser now president of the
Family Research Council, made it a ``C,'' but with a warning
against Sununu's ``pit bull mode.''
   ``Unless he drops his Simon Legree attitude toward conservative
Republican congressmen, he will become a liability to the
president'' Bauer said.
   ``When President Bush takes aim at his own foot, Sununu brings
in the heavy artillery,'' complained Amy Moritz, of the National
Center for Public Policy Research. She said Sununu should take aim
at the left, not at his old friends. She graded him ``D.''
   Among other items on the conservative report card:
   -Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development, got the
highest Cabinet grades, including five ``A's.'' Crane dissented,
awarding Kemp a ``D'' for not resigning to ``rescue the Republican
Party from George Bush.''
   -Back on taxes and the budget, Pines called budget director
Richard G. Darman ``the Milli Vanilli of the Bush White House'' and
said ``he lip syncs what are actually the economic policies of the
Carter administration.'' Pines gave Darman an ``F.''
   Anderson wouldn't even give Darman a grade, saying the budget
director should be expelled.

<HEAD>FDA To Spot Check Milk For Antibiotics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration will begin
weekly tests of raw milk around the nation to determine if it
contains certain antibiotics, the agency said.
   The FDA said Thursday that 250 locations across the country will
be chosen for testing of raw milk samples. The inspections will be
conducted each week in five of the sites, selected randomly.
   The samples will be tested for the presence of eight sulfa drugs
and three tetracycline drugs. The FDA said that when residues are
found, the states will be told and the agency will help track down
the source.
   ``As newer analytical methods become available, milk will be
monitored for additional drugs,'' the FDA said in a statement.
``The system will add another layer of protection for consumers.''
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., attacked the plan as inadequate.
   ``Testing five milk samples per week means that each processing
location in FDA's program will be visited only once a year,'' he
said in a statement. ``FDA's attempt to describe this as a
nationwide program is ludicrous. To even call it a modest proposal
is a wild exaggeration.''
   Weiss, who is chairman of the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources, conducted hearings earlier this
year on the FDA's milk-testing methods.
   Antibiotics are often used by veterinarians to treat infections
in dairy cattle. Testing is conducted to determine if residues from
the drugs are present in the milk.

<HEAD>EPA Tightens Smoking Rules for Employees</HEAD>

   The Environmental Protection Agency will no
longer allow its workers to routinely smoke inside the agency's
offices and facilities.
   The EPA said its Thursday directive is designed to protect
nonsmokers from passive smoke. It applies to 120 agency facilities
nationwide.
   The agency said employees will be provided with separate smoking
lounges equipped with special ventilation systems.
   The previous EPA policy allowed smoking in other designated
areas as well as in restrooms and sections of cafeterias.
   The new smoking policy comes as the EPA staff is considering a
draft study that concludes there is considerable evidence that
passive smoke causes lung cancer. A final report on the draft
study, which has been widely distributed, is expected to be issued
sometime next year.

<HEAD>Unusual Tides Expected Next Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chances of coastal flooding will increase when
a rare alignment of the sun, moon and Earth will produce higher and
lower tides than usual from Sunday through Wednesday, government
forecasters say.
   A similar astronomical arrangement Dec. 1 through Dec. 4. caused
local flooding on the coast of the Gulf of Maine, making this the
second round of unusual tides this month.
   Forecasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said Thursday they expect the turn-of-the-year tides
to be more pronounced on the West Coast than the East Coast.
   The Weather Service forecast no major storms on either coast,
but onshore winds are possible on the New England coast Tuesday and
the mid-Atlantic coast Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The extra tidal displacement should amount to less than a foot,
higher at high tide or lower at low tide, the forecasts said. But
that could be enough to make a difference in some places.
   Heavy rain, snow or onshore winds could bring localized
flooding, NOAA said. Extremely low tides could expose mariners to
low-water hazards but could reduce the threat of flooding during a
storm.
   People living and working in coastal areas were urged to consult
tide tables and to be alert to weather forecasts.

   A moderate earthquake shook southern
Alaska and was felt in Anchorage, authorities said.
   Thursday night's quake, centered about 50 miles south of Denali
National Park, measured 4.9 on the Richter scale, said
seismologists at the Tsunami Warning Center at Palmer.
   It struck at 9:36 p.m. AST (1:36 a.m. EST Friday), said center
chief Tom Sokolowski. He said there were no immediate reports of
damage or injury.
   Anchorage is about 125 miles south of Denali.
   Moderate to strong earthquakes are common throughout Alaska.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 6 on Richter scale can cause severe
damage.
   The devastating 1964 Good Friday earthquake, centered in Prince
William Sound, measured 8.5 on the Richter scale.

<HEAD>Budget ssis Looms As Russia Plans To Cut Billions From
Contribution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, having won his
battle for wider powers from the Soviet Congress, faces a new
crisis as the Russian Federation plans to cut its contribution to
the national budget by more than 80 percent.
   Meanwhile, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, a chief rival of
Gorbachev, suffered his own setback when his capitalist-minded
finance minister quit over the slow pace of reform.
   The Congress of People's Deputies wrapped up its latest session
on Thursday by approving Gorbachev's nominee for the vice
presidency - Gennady I. Yanayev - after narrowly rejecting the
obscure burea5bat in a vote earlier in the day.
   Yanayev, 53, was the only candidate for vice president, a post
created as part of the reorganized federal government hierarchy
that was adopted by legislators Wednesday and which further
centralizes control under Gorbachev.
   During the stormy 10-day session, the Congress endorsed
Gorbachev's draft of a treaty to hold together the crumbling union,
and approved his proposals for national referendums on whether to
allow private ownership of land and whether to preserve the union.
   Beyond the victory, however, looms a serious dispute between
Russia and the central government that threatens the nation's
solvency.
   Gorbachev told the Congress Thursday that Russian lawmakers have
agreed to provide only $37.4 billion toward the national budget for
next year, $190 billion or about 83 percent less than the
republic's contribution this year.
   The vast republic comprises two-thirds of the Soviet Union's
territory and half the country's population.
   The Russians want to keep the money for themselves, saying they
do not recive enough in return to justify their contribution to
the national budget.
   If other republics follow Russia's lead and cut their
contributions to the $400 billion national budget, he said, the
result would be ``a collapse not only of the economy, but of the
union.''
   ``All the people will be on the street,'' he said in a second
speech later, referring to the possibility of massive civil unrest.
   ``What are we supposed to do, disband our military entirely and
stop all fundamental scientific research? That's not serious,''
Gorbachev told lawmakers.
   The 59-year-old Soviet president urged the Russian parliament to
suspend its decision.
   He also asked the national Congress to pass a resolution calling
for a series of actions to resolve the budget dispute, including
creation of a national economic stabilization fund, higher taxes
and higher prices.
   The budget issue is the latest to face Gorbachev as he grapples
with a crumbling economy, independence-minded republics and ethnic
unrest. All 15 Soviet republics have declared some form of
sovereignty.
   Yeltsin faces problems of his own.
   Boris Fyodorov, Russia's 33-year-old finance minister who led
efforts to create a market economy in the republic, resigned
Wednesday in frustration over stalled progress on his plan.
   He said in an interview published Thursday with Rossiiskaya
Gazeta, the official newspaper of the Russian Supreme Soviet
legislature, that Russian lawmakers have been unwilling to take
necessary but unpopular measures such as lifting artificial price
controls and allowing private ownership.
   The impact of Fyodorov's resignation could not immediately be
gauged, but it was certain to raise questions by fledgling
investors and entrepreneurs in the largest of the Soviet Union's 15
republics.
   Fyodorov told the newspaper that decisions such as forming
private companies, setting up a stock market and bringing Russian
accounting practices in line with international norms ``get bogged
down in the depths of the apparatus ... of the Russian Council of
Ministers for months on end.''
   On Nov. 1, the Russian Federation began a program to switch from
a centrally planned, command economy to a free market within 500
days. Russian lawmakers said they wanted to move faster than the
national government, but their policies often conflict and create
confusion rather than reform.
   Fyodorov is credited with helping draft Russia's version of the
500-day plan and was a member of the joint Russian-Soviet committee
that tried to merge the governments' divergent plans.
   A devotee of British economic policies under former Prime
Minister Magaret Thatcher, Fyodorov holds a doctorate in economics
from the Moscow Institute of Finance. He has worked for the huge
Soviet economic planning agency, Gosplan, and the prestigious
Institute for Economics and International Relations.

   Nancy Cruzan's relatives have suffered the
agony of losing her twice, says the minister who stood beside the
young woman's parents as they fought for her right to die.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, who suffered massive brain damage in a 1983 car
crash, was to be buried today. She had lived in a persistent
vegetative state until her death Wednesday, 12 days after a judge
allowed her feeding tube to be disconnected.
   The Rev. Bob Clyde said Ms. Cruzan's family first said their
goodbyes to her after the Jan. 11, 1983, car crash.
   ``She has finally passed away, and they have lost her again,''
he said Thursday.
   Clyde, the family's pastor for the past 1{ years, was to conduct
today's funeral. He said it would be a celebration of Ms. Cruzan's
life before her accident.
   ``I prayed for Nancy, and I prayed with her,'' said the United
Methodist minister. ``My prayer now is that her family will be
comforted, and also be able to grab hold of and recognize the hope
in the midst of their time of grief.''
   Ms. Cruzan's parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, fought for three
years for the right to remove their daughter's feeding tube, saying
she would not want to live in a persistent vegetative state.
   The U.S. Supreme Court, in its first right-to-die decision,
ruled last June that Ms. Cruzan could be allowed to die if ``clear
and convincing'' evidence was presented that that was her wish.
   Three witnesses then testified in state court that she had told
them she would not want to live as a ``vegetable.''
   Pro-life advocates protested the state judge's ruling. Nineteen
of them were arrested last week when they tried to enter Ms.
Cruzan's state hospital room and reattach her feeding room.
   Some of the protesters were affiliated with the anti-abortion
group Operation Rescue.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) - Huge bushfires whipped by gusty winds
burned out of control tonight in two Australian states.
   Two major fires and 18 minor ones were reported throughout New
South Wales as temperatures in the mid-90s and winds of up to about
45 miles per hour hampered firefighters.
   In Victoria, an extra 150 firemen were broughtsections of a huge bushfire
that destroyed 57,000 acres of bush and
grassland in the Strathbogie Ranges.
   Although most of the Victorian blaze had been contained, a
Country Fire Authority spokesman said it was burning out of control
on rough terrain at Mount Wombat.
   Five hundred firemen and 10 tankers were fighting that blaze,
which missed the township of Strathbogie by one-half mile Thursday.
   About 150 fires plagued Victoria on Thursday. One came close
enugh to Melbourne airport to force the closure of one runway.

   Smiling shyly as a staggering line of
well-wishers passed before him, David Souter looked little like a
member of the trio of U.S. Supreme Court justices dubbed
``murderers' row.''
   Souter returned to his home state Thursday for the first time
since becoming the Supreme Court's newest member.
   He's always avoided publicity and crowds, but he greeted
well-wishers for three hours during a Statehouse reception that
drew more than 1,000 people in a ine that stretched down the
stairs from the second-floor Executive Council chambers and out the
door.
   Also known for his modesty, Souter said: ``I wasn't sure anyone
was going to come. I was surprised and very happy.''
   ``An amazing percentage of the people here are old friends from
one of the wars in the past,'' he said.
   Souter is a former state attorney general and state Superior
Court and Supreme Court judge. He briefly was a federal appeals
judge in Boston before he joined the nation's high court in
October.
   Lawyers who argue before the U.S. Supreme Court have dubbed
Sop4fr and justices Antonin Scalia and John Paul Stevens, who sit
together at one end, ``murderers' row'' because of their
penetrating questions, said Souter confidant Tom Rath, a Concord
lawyer and Republican activist.
   Rath said Washington hasn't changed Souter, who often works 14

<HEAD>New Massachusetts Laws Aim to Protect Wildlife Habitat, Reduce
Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVE EPSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials have moved to make Massachusetts
safer for plants, animals and people with laws ordering protection
of wildlife habitat and a drastic reduction in automobile air
pollution.
   The measures were signed Thursday by Gov. Michael Dukakis, who
leaves office next week.
   The wildlife measure provides protection to more than 200
threatened species of plants, animals and invertebrates by
controlling the alteration of wetlands and other areas where the
wildlife reside.
   ``This is the most important environmental legislation for
wildlife ever passed in the commonwealth,'' said Christopher Leahy,
the Massachusetts Audubon Society's conservation director.
   He said the legislation was controversial because it could limit
what some private landowners can do on their property.
   ``But it's crucial to be able to truly protect things,'' he
said.
   The new law also establishes a process for listing species as
endangered, threatened or of special concern, and prohibits the
taking or selling of those that make the list.
   Also Thursday, Dukakis signed a clean air bill that goes beyond
new federal requirements in restricting auto emissions.
   The measure is based on standards recently adopted in
California, and supporters say it makes Massachusetts only the
second state to establish pollution controls stricter than the
federal government's.
   ``We hope to create a domino effect,'' said Jenny Carter of the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group.
   Massachusetts air quality failed to meet federal health
standards on at least 40 days over the past three summers. ``This
law will help reverse that trend,'' Carter said.
   The law orders automobile manufacturers to cut smog-causing
hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions from 50 percent to 75
percent beyond what is required by the federal Clean Air Act.
   The law calls for the new emission standards to be phased in
beginning in 1993.
   Manufacturers can meet the standards using any technology they
wish, but Carter said she expects most manufacturers would refine
catalytic converters to reduce more emissions.
   She estimated the measure would cost consumers an extra $170
when they buy a new car.

<HEAD>Report: Army Flight Surgeon Ordered to End Fast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KILLEEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flight surgeon stationed in Saudi Arabia
against his will has been ordered to end a 28-day hunger strike,
his lawyer says.
   Attorney Richard Prinz said Capt. David Wiggins called him
Wednesday and read a written order instructing the physician to
eat.
   The order indicated Wiggins, 28, was being required to eat
because he is ``too weak to perform his duties and that combat
might be necessary immediately,'' Prinz told the Temple Daily
Telegram in a story published Thursday.
   Prinz would not say if Wiggins would disobey the order, but said
``if you've been covering the story, I think you know what the
answer is.'' Wiggins' wife, Patty, said Thursday her husband told
Prinz he would refuse the order.
   Wiggins, who is 5-foot-10, weighed 167 pounds when he began his
hunger strike on Nov. 30, and had lost about 21 pounds on a diet of
vitamins and water when he was sent to Saudi Arabia on Dec. 17 as
part of Operation Desert Shield. He stopped eating after a federal
judge rejected his appeal of an Army decision to deny his
conscientious-objector application. Wiggins, whose hometown is
Waverly, N.Y., had been stationed in Fort Hood.
   Maj. Jesse Seigal, an Army spokesman, said he ``had heard'' the
flight surgeon would be ordered to eat, but said he could not
confirm the order was given.
   Seigal declined to speculate on the consequences of Wiggins
disobeying the order. He said anything from a verbal reprimand to a
full court martial is possible.
   Mrs. Wiggins said she had not spoken directly with her husband
and did not know how he is holding up physically. In a letter she
received Thursday, he told of being watched closely by military
police, she said.
   A 1984 graduate of West Point who finished 23rd in a class of
more than 1,000, Wiggins has said he was enthusiastic at first
about joining the Army. Over time, however, Wiggins said he became
disillusioned and that war was ``an unnecessary evil.''

<DATELINE>AVIGNON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's hard-line Communist Party
leader, Georges Marchais, walked out of a hospital today after two
days of treatment for a mild heart attack.
   A pale Marchais, 70, played down the attack as ``a light
problem'' and told reporters that ``retirement isn't for me''
before beginning a journey to his home in Paris.
   The combative leader of the dwindling Communist Party was to be
accompanied on the flight by a cardiologist and paramedics.
   Marchais suffered the heart attack Wednesday morning at his
vacation home in nearby Robion. He was rushed to Henri-Duffaut
hospital in Avignon.
   He had been enjoying a holiday after last week's party congress
where he received 99 percent of the delegates' votes to serve a new
term as party secretary-general. He has led the party since 1972.
   The victory marked a triumph after a year of criticism by party
reformers for Marchais' failure to change his orthodox views
despite the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.
   Once the largest political party in France, the Communists have
seen their political muscle weaken steadily during the 1980s.
   Communist deputies held 44 seats in the 577-member National
Assembly in 1981 but have only 26 today.

   The mob movies ``The Godfather,
Part III'' and ``GoodFellas'' have begun to move in on Academy
Award turf, capturing 12 Golden Globe nominations between them.
   Oscar nominations won't be disclosed until Feb. 13, but
Thursday's Golden Globe selections established the two Mafia dramas
and Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' as strong early
favorites.
   ``The Godfather, Part III'' was nominated seven times and
``GoodFellas'' collected five nominations from the membership of
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
   In awards already presented, ``GoodFellas'' has been named best
film in year-end voting by film critics associations in New York
and Los Angeles.
   The National Board of Review selected ``Dances With Wolves,''
directed by and starring Costner, the best movie of the year. The
western collected the second most nominations - six - in Golden
Globe voting, including best dramatic motion picture.
   Other films receiving multiple nominations, four apiece, were
``Dick Tracy,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Reversal of
Fortune.''
   The Golden Globes do not carry the prestige of the Oscars, but
in past years have presaged Academy Award nominations fairly
accurately. Trophies will be presented Jan. 19 - the same day Oscar
ballots are mailed.
   The Golden Globes will be broadcast from Beverly Hills by cable
television's TBS.
   The ``Godfather'' sequel was selected for best dramatic motion
picture and received nominations for best actor (Al Pacino),
supporting actor (Andy Garcia), director (Francis Ford Coppola) and
best screenplay (Coppola and Mario Puzo.
   The movie also received nods for original score and original
song, ``Promise Me You'll Remember.''
   Costner was nominated for best actor and best director in his
first directing effort. ``Wolves'' co-star Mary McDonnell drew a
supporting actress nomination.
   ``GoodFellas''' five nominations included best dramatic motion
picture and best director for Martin Scorsese, also honored for
co-writing the movie.
   Unlike the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes divide films in two
categories - drama and musical or comedy.
   In one wacky selection, ``Ghost,'' the enormously popular
tearjerker, was judged in the musical-comedy category. Other
nominees for best musical or comic motion picture were ``Dick
Tracy,'' ``Green Card,'' ``Home Alone'' and ``Pretty Woman.''
   In another peculiar matchup, the 86 foreign press members said
Macaulay Culkin, the 10-year-old star of ``Home Alone,'' and Gerard
Depardieu, the great French actor who stars in ``Green Card,'' will
compete for best actor in a musical or comedy.
   Nominated for dramatic actress were Kathy Bates for ``Misery,''
Anjelica Huston for ``The Grifters,'' Michelle Pfeiffer for ``The
Russia House,'' Susan Sarandon for ``White Palace'' and Joanne
Woodward for ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.''
   Best dramatic actor nominees, in addition to Costner and Pacino,
included Richard Harris for ``The Field,'' Jeremy Irons for
``Reversal of Fortune'' and Robin Williams for ``Awakenings.''
   Best musical or comic actress selections were Mia Farrow for
``Alice,'' Andie MacDowell for ``Green Card,'' Demi Moore for
``Ghost,'' Julia Roberts for ``Pretty Woman'' and Meryl Streep for
``Postcards From the Edge.''
   Best musical or comic actor competitors include Culkin,
Depardieu, Johnny Depp of ``Edward Scissorhands,'' Richard Gere of
``Pretty Woman'' and Patrick Swayze of ``Ghost.''
   Foreign language film nominees were ``Cyrano de Bergerac,''
``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' ``The Nasty Girl,'' ``Requiem for
Dominic'' and ``Taxi Blues.''
   Screenplay nominees were ``Dances with Wolves,'' ``Reversal of
Fortune,'' ``Avalon,'' ``GoodFellas'' and ``The Godfather Part
III.''
   Golden Globes are also presented in television. Among TV shows,
``L.A. Law'' led with five nominations and director David Lynch's
cult saga, ``Twin Peaks,'' had four.
   ``China Beach,'' the Vietnam War drama, was nominated for best
dramatic series while Dana Delany was nominated for best actress.
The series currently is off the air, but may come back in the
spring.

<TEXT>
   A Jewish vigilante group that claimed
responsibility for wounding three Palestinians in a roadside ambush
says it will launch more attacks on Arabs, an Israeli journalist
reported today.
   In the occupied lands, meanwhile, Palestinians observed a
general strike called to protest the mass immigration of Soviet
Jews and the increasing settlement of Jews in Israeli-occupied land
in east Jerusalem.
   Roni Shaked, a reporter for the Yedioth Ahronoth daily
newspaper, said an anonymous telephone caller told him an hour
after the shooting Thursday night that ``this is the first activity
of the group, and there are going to be more actions, and much
worse than this.''
   The caller claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of
a group calling itself the ``Zionist Avengers.''
   Relatives of the victims and some liberal Israelis claim the
right-wing government maintains a lax attitude toward Jewish
militants and encourages violence against Arabs.
   The shooting attack came a day after three Jewish settlers were
freed after serving less than seven years of a life term for
killing three Palestinians in a shooting spree and maiming two West
Bank mayors with car bombs. They were greeted as heroes by fellow
settlers.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens condemned Thursday's shooting as a
``criminal act'' and said the assailants would be ``most severely
punished.'' Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir, called the attack ``shocking.''
   One of the victims, 30-year-old Faisal Amer, was in serious but
stable condition after being shot several times in the chest, leg
and abdomen, said Ruth Mekel, a spokeswoman for Jerusalem's
Hadassah Hospital.
   Amer's 34-year-old sister, Ibtissam, was in stable condition
after being shot in the hand. Her 9-month-old daughter, who was hit
by shrapnel in the hips, was also stable, Mrs. Mekel said.
   Amer, a physician from the West Bank town of Hebron, was driving
his sister and niece home late Thursday when his car was flagged
down by a man in army uniform on the main highway between Bethlehem
and Hebron, Israel army radio said.
   Amer slowed down the car and the man in uniform started shooting
with a submachine gun, the report said.
   Ibtissam Amer said the assailant told her that ``you will both
die, and God will not protect you.''
   The army said no soldiers were involved in the incident.
   ``We shot at an Arab car tonight, and I hope people were killed
in the attack,'' Shaked quoted the caller as saying.
   The caller told Shaked, who is well-known for his coverage of
the occupied territories, that the shooting was a warning to the
government to do more to protect Jews. Similar calls were made to
Israel's army radio and other news organizations.

   A record 201 manatees died in Florida
waters this year, authorities said.
   At least 46 of the endangered sea cows were found dead in the
weeks following a three-day freeze last Christmas, and boat
collisions killed at least 46 more, said Bruce Ackerman, a marine
mammal researcher with the state Department of Natural Resources.
   A variety of factors contributed to the other deaths.
   Last year, 166 manatees were killed, up from 133 in 1988.
   State officials estimate there are 1,200 to 1,500 West Indian
manatees in Florida, down from an estimated 10,000 several decades
ago.
   The manatee has been around for 60 million years, evolving from
four-footed creatures about the time the dinosaurs were on their
last legs. The big, slow sea cows loll in warm, shallow areas in
oceans, rivers and canals to feed on underwater grass. They can be
longer than 10 feet and weigh more than 1,000 pounds and are unable
to avoid fast boats.

<HEAD>Snow in the Pacific Northwest and Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A winter storm hit the Pacific Northwest for the second time in
a week and snow and freezing rain fell in the Northeast early
today. The South and Midwest had rain and fog.
   Washington state was expecting up to five inches of snow today
and accumulations of up to three inches were possible in Oregon. In
California, where record cold has ruined much of the citrus crop,
temperatures could dip into the low 20s in some valley locations
tonight.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for Idaho and Utah and a
high wind watch was in effect for some sections in Colorado. Snow
was also expected in northern North Dakota.
   In the East, snow was the forecast for much of New England and a
mixture of snow and rain was predicted for the Middle Atlantic
region.
   Temperatures were expected to warm into the 40s and 50s in the
Midwest, where winter storms dumped up to a foot of snow Thursday.
The South was looking for sunshine and highs in the 60s and 70s.
   Florida was expected to be, again, comfortably above it all,
with sunny skies and highs in the 80s. On Thursday, Tampa recorded
the nation's high temperature, peaking at 85 degrees.

   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
thin and sluggish early trading today. Gold prices rose more than
$3, boosted by the approaching Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face possible force.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.60 yen to a closing 136.05 yen.
Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 135.78 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid morning compared with late Thursday:
   -1.5190 German marks, down from 1.5310
   -1.2960 Swiss francs, down from 1.3090
   -5.1640 French francs, down from 5.2050

   -1,145.00 Italian lire, down from 1,152.75
   -1.1607 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1618
   In London, the dollar also fell against the British pound.
Sterling was quoted at $1.8977, more expensive than $1.8870 late
Thursday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$385.40 an ounce at mid morning, up from $382.25 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price at noon was $385.25, up from $382.20
late Thursday.
   Bullion dealers said remarks by President Bush that there has
been no progress on fixing a date for Secretary of State James A.
Baker III to visit Iraq for talks helped increase prices.
   Gold is a traditional haven for investors in times of crisis.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.36 an ounce to close at a

<HEAD>Death Penalty For Drugs And Pornography; Security Chief Replaced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese officials today approved the death
penalty for some drug and pornography cases, and they replaced the
security chief who failed to quell last year's pro-democracy
movement.
   Wang Fang, the 70-year-old public security minister in charge of
the police, submitted his resignation before today's meeting of the
Standing Committee of China's legislature, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
   He was replaced with Tao Siju, 55, who was vice minister of
public security since 1988. Tao's ascendancy was predicted after he
accompanied Communist Premier Li Peng on a tour of four Asian
countries earlier this month.
   The report gave no reason for the departure of Wang, who served
in the post since 1987.
   But as early as last year Chinese sources said Wang was expected
to step down in disgrace for his failure to keep last year's
pro-democracy marches by Beijing college students from escalating
into a nationwide mass movement.
   Police were ordered to block the initial student marches but
failed, sometimes offering only token resistance. Some uniformed
police flashed V-for-victory signs to show support.
   The government finally called the army into Beijing's Tiananmen
Square on June 4, 1989, causing hundreds of deaths.
   The 135-member Standing Committee, which concluded a nine-day
session today, meets between annual sessions of the full
2,700-delegate National People's Congress.
   Xinhua said the new drug law approved by the committee specifies
sentences ranging from 15 years in prison to the death sentence for
ringleaders of drug smuggling gangs and those linked to
international rings. It also calls for sentences of seven years to
life for possession of 2.2 pounds of opium or 1.75 ounces of
heroin.
   Drug abuse in China, while still far below Western levels, has
increased in recent years along with income levels. A growing
problem is the shipment of drugs from Southeast Asia through China
to Hong Kong.
   The committee mandated life imprisonment or execution for
``serious cases'' of producing or selling pornographic materials,
but Xinhua did not say what would constitute a serious case.
   ``Theresolution is aimed at safeguarding social order and
promoting advanced socialist culture,'' Xinhua said.
   China already allows judges to hand down the death penalty for
virtually any crime if they deem the circumstances serious enough,
and hundreds are executed annually, based on media reports alone.
Official totals are never released.
   Also today, Zheng Tuobin, 66, minister of foreign economic
relations and trade since 1985, resigned and was replaced by his
vice minister, Li Lanqing, Xinhua said. No reason was given.
   Western diplomats, however, said they were told earlier in the
year that Zheng was ill. He was not believed to be in political
trouble.
   The diplomats described his successor, Li, 58, as a pragmatist
who worked in the auto industry and has experience in administering
state loans and foreign investment. He speaks English and Russian.

   France will restore official lines of credit for
French-managed projects in China broken off last year after the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, an official said today.
   An Economics Ministry official said a protocol signed last week
by China and France will free loans of $260 million to finance
telecommunications and water treatment projects.
   The official said France's move is in accordance with a decision
taken by the 12-nation European Community in November to normalize
economic relations with Communist China.
   The funds will be the first official transfer from France to
China since the Beijing government ordered the harsh crackdown on
pro-democracy activists June 4, 1989 at Tiananmen Square.
   The French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
several subsidiaries of France's Cie Generale d'Electricite,
including Alcatel NV, were among the major contractors for the
projects suspended last year.

<HEAD>Parent of Patient at Nancy Cruzan's Hospital Wants to Remove
Feeding Tube</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Cruzan Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNT VERNON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of a brain-damaged patient
at the hospital where Nancy Cruzan died this week wants to move his
daughter to another state and remove her feeding tube.
   ``I'm not going to let my kid stay like that,'' Pete Busalacchi
said of his 20-year-old daughter, Christine, who has been in a
persistent vegetative state since a 1987 car accident in St. Louis.
``If she knows what's going on, it's pure torture. If she doesn't,
it's not worth going on.''
   Busalacchi, 43, of St. Charles, declined to say what other
facilities or states he was considering. ``It might happen real
soon,'' he said.
   Ms. Cruzan died at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center early
Wednesday, 12 days after a judge ruled that her parents had
convincing evidence that she would want to die and allowed doctors
to remove her feeding tube. She had been in a persistent vegetative
state since a 1983 car crash.
   Busalacchi said he wants to move his daughter to a state with
less strict regulations because he does not have the evidence
required to meet the Missouri law and also hopes to avoid the
publicity that surrounded the Cruzan case.
   While Ms. Cruzan starved and dehydrated, anti-euthanasia
protesters held a vigil outside the southwestern Missouri state
hospital. Nineteen protesters were arrested when they tried to
enter her room. The protesters said they feared the case would turn
the rehabilitation center into a mecca for people seeking
euthanasia for family members.
   Ms. Cruzan's parents' legal battle led to the first U.S. Supreme
Court ruling in a right-to-die case. The court said states can
require ``clear and convincing'' evidence that the patient would
want to die.
   Busalacchi has not taken his daughter's case to court.
   He said several doctors have told him his daughter is not likely
to recover, but that some hospital staff members said she has shown
improvement.
   Administrator Don Lamkins said the center would not try to
prevent Busalacchi from moving his daughter.

<TEXT>
   Two Argentine nationals and two local jewelry
dealers have been convicted of laundering $350 million in Colombian
drug profits through jewelry markets.
   It was the biggest money-laundering case ever tried in this
country, prosecutors said.
   Raul Vivas, 38, of Argentina and jewelry dealers Nazareth and
Vahe Andonian of Los Angeles each were convicted Wednesday of 25
felony counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to
launder money.
   Juan Carlos Seresi, also from Argentina, was convicted of 20
felony money laundering counts and a conspiracy count.
   Each money laundering count carries a maximum 20-year prison
term. The conspiracy count carries a maximum prison term of five
years.
   Federal court jurors said they were unable to reach verdicts on
narcotics conspiracy counts against the four defendants. The panel
also failed to reach verdicts on 27 counts against Ruben Saini,
another Argentine, accused of helping to destroy evidence.
   U.S. District Judge William Keller ordered jurors Thursday to
resume deliberations on those counts.
   Federal prosecutors claimed Vivas created a laundering operation
dubbed ``La Mina,'' or ``the mine,'' that was based on a triangular
trade of drugs, gold and cash by Colombian drug traders.
   Though the amount cited by prosecutors in the trial was $350
million, in the past, investigators have said the amount laundered
by ``La Mina'' could total $1 billion in Los Angeles and other
cities including New York and Miami.
   The network used drug profits to buy gold through jewelers for
Colombian cocaine traffickers, prosecutors said. Officials of Wells
Fargo Bank in Los Angeles told federal officials the Andonians, who
operated Andonian Brothers Jewelry in Los Angeles, had deposited
$25 million in cash during a three-month period.
   Earlier this month, the jury acquitted four jewelry company
employees charged with playing lesser roles in the organization.

   An ultra-Orthodox rabbi considered to be a
political kingmaker has enraged religious and secular Israelis by
saying the Holocaust was God's punishment for sins such as
violating the Sabbath and eating pork.
   ``Not for a long time has any single remark caused such an
emotional reaction,'' said Razi Barkai, host of a radio talk show
that was flooded with hundreds of calls Thursday over the remarks
of Rabbi Eliezer Schach.
   Barkai said calls ran about 3-to-2 against the 97-year-old
rabbi, who said another disaster may befall Jews for violating
traditional religious tenets.
   ``The last time he brought destruction, it was the Holocaust ...
Because of the sins, the Almighty may bring another Holocaust upon
us, and it may already be tomorrow,'' Schach told Jewish seminary
students earlier this week.
   About 6 million Jews died in the Nazi genocide during World War
II, and tens of thousands of survivors live in Israel. Five percent
of Israel's Jewish residents are ultra-Orthodox, while 70 percent
define themselves as secular.
   ``Rabbi Schach today is one of the most powerful men in Israeli
politics and each one of his words creates a lot of noise,'' said
sociologist Menachem Friedman, an expert on religious communities.
   Earlier this year, Schach helped Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
form a government by ordering his followers to join Shamir's
coalition. The support of two factions loyal to Schach gave Shamir
60 votes in the 120-member parliament. Shamir also had a promise of
support from the two-seat ultra-rightist Moledet faction, which
stayed outside the coalition.
   In exchange for the support of another ultra-Orthodox faction,
Agudat Israel, the government party asked for a series of reform
laws, including a ban on sexually suggestive ads and sale of pork,
forbidden by Jewish dietary laws.
   The Knesset, or parliament, earlier this month outlawed outdoor
advertising that features scantily clad people. It is expected to
take up some of the other proposals soon.
   The proposed laws have angered many secular Israelis, who claim
the ultra-Orthodox minority carries too much influence.
   Schach's comments on the Holocaust was simply repeating a theme
common in the Bible: of divine retribution against the Jewish
people for straying from the path of their religious law.
   But on another level, many took his remarks to mean that the
Jews somehow were to blame for the Nazis' behavior.
   ``The Almighty keeps a balance sheet of the world, and when the
sins become too many, he brings destruction. We don't know how long
his patience holds out, sometimes 20 years, sometimes 10 and
sometimes only a year,'' Schach said.
   Schach's chief rival, Brooklyn-based Rabbi Menachem Schneersohn,
told supporters Thursday the Jews who died in the Holocaust were
``pure and holy.''
   ``Heaven forbid someone should say that the Jews sinned in some
way and God settled accounts with them and imposed on them the most
terrible sentence of the past generation,'' said Schneersohn, the
politically influential leader of the Hasidic Habad movement.
   Some of Schach's sharpest critics were Holocaust survivors.
   Menahem Russak, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp
and a former commander of the Israeli police unit investigating
Nazi war crimes, said Schach ``shamed and humiliated'' millions of
Holocaust victims.
   His voice shaking, Russak told listeners that Schach ``not only
exonerated the Nazi murderers, but turned them into messengers of
God who were sent to punish the people of Israel for not observing
the Torah.''
   But another caller, an ultra-Orthodox woman who lost relatives
in the Holocaust, defended the rabbi.
   ``With al the pain I have, I can understand his words. We
believe in the link between sin and punishment,'' said the woman,
who did not give her name.
   Friedman said Schach's views reflect ultra-Orthodox thinking
prevalent since the 1950s.
   But secular Israelis only began listening after the
ultra-Orthodox left their self-chosen isolation and entered Israeli
politics in the 1980s, Friedman said.
   The secular public tends to stereotype ultra-Orthodox Jews like
Schach as throwbacks to the Jews' ghetto years who never embraced
the Zionist cause. For one thing, they speak Yiddish, the language
of the ghetto in Europe, rather than Hebrew.

<HEAD>Aquino Says Philippines Can Meet Swiss Deadline on Marcos Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said today
her government would meet conditions set by a Swiss court for the
return of $350 million deposited in Switzerland by the late
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   In a decision made public Thursday, the Swiss Supreme Court
ruled the money must be returned as soon as a competent Philippine
criminal court has issued a ``legally binding'' verdict in a case
against Marcos and his wife, Imelda.
   The money has been frozen in several Swiss banks since March
1986.
   The order set a one-year deadline for the Philippine government
to complete legal proceedings. It said that if no verdict is
returned within that period, Swiss banks would end their seizure of
the assets.
   ``The decision of Switzerland's Federal Supreme Court should be
hailed as a victory for the Filipino people,'' Mrs. Aquino said in
a statement. ``For our part, we are confident that we will be able
to fulfill the conditions within the time frame available.''
   Neither Marcos, who died in September 1989, nor his widow,
Imelda, has ever been charged with a criminal offense in the
Philippines because the government feared they would demand their
right to return from exile and face trial.
   But David Castro, chairman of the Presidential Commission on
Good Government, said the government did not have to file criminal
charges against the Marcoses to meet the terms of the Swiss order.
   Castro said a guilty verdict in civil suits for embezzlement
against the Marcoses handed down by an anti-graft court would
satisfy the Swiss Supreme Court requirement.
   Castro said the Philippine Supreme Court has ruled in the past
that a civil suit whose penalty is forfeiture of assets was ``penal
in nature'' as in a criminal case.
   He said the government's Swiss lawyers assured him that this
formula would satisfy the Swiss Supreme Court. The government has
filed 35 civil cases against the Marcoses and their close
associates in the anti-graft court.
   In Bern, however, Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said
the Swiss government has ``no reason to doubt that the Philippines
will open criminal proceedings'' in the case.
   He said it was ``clear that criminal proceedings have to be
conducted and that the accused will have to be granted all the
rights of defense provided for by the federal constitution and the
European Human Rights Convention.''
   Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii after a popular revolt
toppled his 20-year rule and swept Mrs. Aquino to the presidency.
Mrs. Aquino banned the return of the Marcos family, citing security
threats.
   The Aquino government claims Marcos and his associates embezzled
up to $10 billion but has offered little evidence to substantiate
that figure.
   In the four years since Marcos' ouster, the government has
managed to retrieve only $400 million, mostly from Marcos'
associates.
   Castro said the government expects to find more of Marcos'
``hidden wealth'' after it obtains seized bank records, which under
the Swiss Supreme Court ruling can be handed over to the Philippine
government.

   A Georgia man who rushed from his bed to save
a woman from drowning was among 16 people honored for heroism,
including four people who died trying to help others.
   The awards were announced Thursday by the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission, based in Pittsburgh.
   Andrew ``Skeet'' Moss, honored for saving Kelley Gibbs after her
car was swept off a flooded street last March, recalled how he
wasn't sure what was going on when the woman's screams awakened
him.
   ``I thought it was a cat screaming and finally, my wife said,
`Get up! Get up! There's a woman screaming,' '' Moss, an air
traffic controller from McDonough, Ga., said Thursday in a
telephone interview.
   He threw on a pair of jeans and rushed outside to find the
19-year-old in the creek at the edge of his yard. He waded in,
braced himself against a tree and pulled her to safety.
   ``I was scared to death the whole time. The current was real
strong and I wasn't exactly sure where I was,'' he said. ``I just
didn't want to do the wrong thing.''
   Moss, 30, and the other heroes or their survivors each will
receive a Carnegie Medal and $2,500.
   The commission presents awards about every two months to people
who risk their lives to help others. Industrialist Andrew Carnegie
founded the panel in 1904 after a mine accident near Pittsburgh
killed 178 people, including some who tried to save others.
   Thursday's awards bring to 106 the number of people recognized
in 1990 and to 7,511 those honored in the United States and Canada
since the commission was established.
   Also honored Thursday were:
   -Jonathon E.J. Swenson, 9, Sumner, Wash., who died after trying
to save his aunt and two cousins from a burning house Feb. 4, 1989.
When the house caught fire, he ran upstairs to alert the others. He
was overcome by smoke and died two days later.
   -Jessie R. Moore, 29, Rocky Mount, N.C., a laborer who died Aug.
5, 1989, trying to save an 8-year-old girl from drowning in the
Atlantic Ocean at Beaufort, N.C. The girl, who could not swim and
had fallen off an inner tube, survived.
   -Clayton M. Cutter, 31, a forestry technician who died trying to
save three teen-age campers and a counselor from drowning Feb. 19,
1990, at Mammoth Lakes, Calif. The campers, their counselor,
another counselor and a firefighter also drowned in the icy lake.
   -Rickey Lee Dewey, 27, Lexington, Neb., a farm hand who died
Aug. 6, 1989, trying to save his 19-year-old cousin from drowning.
The younger man, who could not swim, had fallen into a canal from a
bridge.
   -John A. McDaniel, 26, Summerville, Ga., a cotton-mill laborer
who saved an 11-year-old boy from drowning June 11, 1989, in a
river in Fort Payne, Ala. McDaniel entered the river and grabbed
the boy and held him at the brink of 60-foot-high falls until the
two were pulled from the water by others.
   -Kurt Ernst, 31, Rochester, N.Y., a meter reader who saved a
2-year-old boy and his 6-month-old sister from burning Dec. 2,
1989. Ernst saw the flames as he was driving past the family's
apartment. He crawled through a window, found the boy and handed
him to another person outside. Ernst returned to find the girl and
her mother on the floor. He carried the infant to the window and
arriving firefighters saved the mother and another child.
   -Darryl W. Lastiwka, 29, Thorold, Ontario, a carpenter who
rescued a 21-year-old woman from her burning apartment Nov. 30,
1989. Lastiwka, a neighbor, crawled on the floor under smoke, found
the unconscious woman on the kitchen floor and carried her to
safety.
   -Patrick M. Maloney, 27, Chicago, a paramedic who saved a man
from being assaulted with a knife by an enraged motorist at the
scene of an auto accident Dec. 31, 1988.
   -John E. Moore, 43, Dunn, N.C., and Ronnie Gene Woodall, 36,
Benson, N.C., who helped rescue a 26-year-old woman from a burning
car Dec. 5, 1989, after a highway accident.
   -Robert W. Lemon, 40, and Timothy L. Donoghue, 43, both of Ojai,

   About 16,000 sailors and Marines began
leaving today for the Middle East as the Navy beefs up its
Operation Desert Shield forces.
   The deployments of 17 ships from East Coast ports, including
eight from the huge Norfolk Naval Base, involved a rare same-day
departure for two aircraft carriers, the USS America and the USS
Theodore Roosevelt.
   Several dozen tearful relatives lined the piers in a brisk
breeze and drizzle as the destroyer USS Caron, one of the earliest
ships to leave, pulled out about 8 a.m.
   Joseph Leyes, whose son, Louis, is an ensign aboard the Caron,
said he felt a mixture of emotions: ``sad, excited, supportive,
frightened.''
   ``They're going to go out there; they're going to do a job;
they're going to come back,'' he said.
   Donna Beckum, whose husband, Larry, also is a Caron crewman,
said her main concern was ``just how long they're going to be
gone.''
   The Roosevelt and America, which were to sail early in the
afternoon, will join three other carriers - the USS Kennedy, USS
Saratoga and USS Ranger - already operating in the Middle East,
where thousands of U.S. forces have been sent since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The deployment of such a large number of U.S. warships to one
part of the world is unprecedented since the Vietnam war.
   Capt. Charles S. Abbot, commanding officer of the Roosevelt,
said his crew was prepared, though not eager, to leave home so soon
after the holiday.
   ``There's really no discontent that I've observed,'' said Abbot,
whose ship's last deployment was almost 18 months ago.
   Still, Christmas was bittersweet for those shipping out and
their families.
   ``I'm happy he was here for Christmas, but I'm upset he's
leaving and not knowing when he's coming back,'' said Carmen
Kubala, whose husband, Dan, is an electrician aboard the America.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the U.N. has set a Jan. 15
deadline for it to withdraw or face possible military action. Navy
officials said the carriers will take about two weeks to get to
their destination.

   A court found 63 people guilty today for
taking part in nationwide rioting two weeks ago that left at least
five people dead.
   The rioting Dec. 14-15 broke out in several cities in this North
African country during a general strike by the nation's two largest
labor unions.
   Two human rights groups today formed an independent commission
to determine who fired during clashes between rioters and security
forces in Fez that led to the deaths. The panel will also determine
how many peopl died. The government said five people were killed,
but the trade unions say about 30 died.
   Parliament on Thursday created a separate commission of 25
legislators to investigate the disturbances.
   The court in Kenitra, near Rabat, today found 63 people guilty
of rioting. Eleven people were sentenced to two years in prison and
22 to one year. The remaining rioters received terms ranging from
one to three months.
   The sentences come a day after officials announced that 87
people had received stiff jail sentences - some as long as seven
years - for taking part in disturbances in Fez, Meknes and
Tangiers.
   Fez, the country's spiritual and intellectual capital, was the
site of the most extensive violence. Soldiers and police intervened
as rioters attacked hotels, post offices and a police station.
   The government is negotiating this week with unions and
employers on ``priority measures'' promised after the disturbances.
Among the measures under consideration are increases in minimum
wages and in social allocations.

   Snow returned to the normally rainy Pacific Northwest today,
making roads treacherous and knocking out power, and several inches
fell in the East a few days after many cities recorded their
warmest Christmas ever.
   Forecasters said a second ``Yukon Express'' air mass could send
the mercury plummeting again in California, where record cold
devastated citrus crops last week. Temperatures could dip into the
low 20s in some valley locations tonight even before the second
arctic blast arrives.
   Cold and stormy weather have been blamed for more than 80 deaths
nationwide in the past 10 days.
   Seattle, known for rain, got heavy snow for the second time in a
week. Washington state residents stocked up on tire chains,
flashlights and candles.
   ``We are pretty much prepared this time,'' said Jeanne Grijalva,
emergency management coordinator for Kitsap County. ``It won't
catch everyone off guard like it did last week. That was one of the
worst storms people in this county had seen for years.''
   Some 6 inches of snow fell on hills east of the Seattle
metropolitan area, the weather service said. Three inches hit
downtown Everett, but little of the snow that fell on Seattle
stuck.
   At least 34,000 customers were without electricity today because
of downed power lines, said Teri Van Duine, spokeswoman for Puget
Power, the region's largest utility.
   Strong winds in central Oregon caused trees to tumble, damaging
automobiles and power lines. A Bend fireman was seriously injured
by a falling tree while helping clear debris on a roadway,
sheriff's deputies said.
   In New York City, 7 inches of snow fell by 6 a.m. today in
Central Park, just a few days after record warm weather saw
temperatures rise into the 60s. By late morning, the snow had
changed to freezing rain.
   The city mobilized hundreds of salt-spreading trucks and
snowplows. Motorists were urged to leave their cars at home.
   Bob Lavner, a spokesman for the Automobile Association of
America, said the timing of the storm would hold down traffic
problems and reduce calls for emergency service.
   ``It's a Friday at the end of a holiday week. The volume of cars
on the road is going to be down and people are going to stay home
because of the snowfall,'' Lavner said.
   The winter's first major snowstorm slowed commuter traffic in
Pennsylvania's metropolitan areas, but few problems were reported.
   ``Everything appears to be under control and (today's) rain will
make everything slushy, and should pretty much melt all this
away,'' said Deborah Weisberg, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation in Pittsburgh.
   Delays of 10 to 20 minutes were reported during the morning rush
on some regional rail and bus routes in the Philadelphia area.
   Martinsburg, W.Va., was buried under at least 10 inches of snow
and freezing rain turned West Virginia's highways into skating
rinks, authorities said today.
   ``We don't have any roads shut down per se. But they're bad,
real bad,'' Berkeley County emergency services dispatcher Robin
Taylor said. ``They're just full of snow.''
   ``The cars are all over the place. They're a mess.''
   Ohio's first major storm of the winter dumped 8 inches of snow
on Cincinnati and other southwestern cities Thursday, but the
precipitation changed to rain this morning. Highs in the 40s were
forecast, and the much of the snow was expected to melt.
   In Hedgesville, W.Va., four members of one family died and two
were missing when their car plunged off a bridge into a creek on
Wednesday, authorities said. Recent rain and snow swelled the creek
to twice its normal 4-foot depth, and water covered the bridge.
Rescuers today resumed their search for two boys who were still
missing.
   In Indianapolis, a homeless woman was found dead outside an
abandoned service station, and authorities said she probably died
of hypothermia when the thermometer plunged into the single digits
Wednesday night.
   Warmer temperatures were expected today in Indiana, where icy
roads and accumulations of 6 or more inches of snow forced hundreds
of holiday travelers to check into motels Thursday. Police reported
hundreds of accidents, but no traffic deaths.
   A blizzard in North Dakota dropped visibility to near zero in
some areas Thursday night and forecasters said wind chills could
drop to 40 to 60 below in the western and central part of the state
today.
   ``It could be close to impossible to travel,'' said Bob
Nordland, a forecaster at the National Weather Service in Fargo.
Temperatures were expected to reach the 50s by the weekend.
   In San Francisco, the record cold wave drove ants indoors in
search of warmth and food.
   ``People are frantic, some hysterical,'' said Ann McDonald,
whose husband, Rich, owns a pest control company.
   One of McDonald's customers in Sausalito left half a cake out
Christmas night. When she got up the next morning she found ``the
ants had taken over.''
   ``They were all over everything,'' Dorothy McLaird said. The
counters and cupboards were alive with what McDonald estimated as
30,000 ants.

   Two escaped prisoners killed
themselves with a revolver today rather than surrender to police
approaching their lakeside hideout in helicopters and rubber boats.
   The shootings ended a 36-hour chase for three convicted
murderers who broke out of their jail early Thursday by sawing
through bars in their cell, police said. Hundreds of police were
mobilized for the manhunt.
   One escapee was caught near the rural lake outside the
provincial city of Taejon. When police found him, he surrendered
peacefully and asked for food, police said.
   The other two - Park Bong-sun, 30, and Shin Kwang-jae, 21 -
crossed the lake aboard a stolen boat but were trapped by a dozen
sharpshooters on the shore. Civilians, including news
photographers, witnessed the dramatic lakeside standoff.
   The two rejected repeated calls to surrender, with Park holding
the revolver to his head and threatening to shoot himself. As
police approached in helicopters and rubber boats, Park fired a
bullet into his head.
   Shin then took the gun and fired a bullet into his chest. He
died on the way to a hospital.
   The revolver had been stolen from a policemen earlier today,
when the escapees, armed with a knife, had been stopped for
questioning at a bus terminal in Taejon, 100 miles south of Seoul.
   A police officer was stabbed in his neck and seriously injured
during that confrontation.

   Millions of dollars in federal funds provided
to the states to fight the war against drugs are going unspent, the
Office of National Drug Control Policy says.
   States have been spending just two-thirds of their federal
grants aimed at fighting drugs over the last four years, the White
House agency said Thursday.
   The situation is most striking for law enforcement grants, where
states have spent only 40 percent of the federal money they have
received, said Bruce Carnes, director of planning, budget and
administration for the drug policy office.
   ``I think what's bringing the spending level down is the law
enforcement grant, because there were such enormous increases in
that in the last two years,'' said Carnes, who released the figures
as his office issued a report on block grants given to states over
the past few years.
   Anti-drug block grants issued by the Justice Department dropped
from $178 million in the 1987 fiscal year to a low of $56 million
in 1988. They jumped back to $119 million in 1989 before zooming to
$395 million in fiscal 1990, which ended Sept. 30. They climb to
$423 million this year.
   ``There's going to be a huge wave of money,'' Carnes said. ``It
started to descend on them in '89 and '90, and it's going to keep
going up this year.''
   Carnes said states spent 82 percent of their drug treatment and
prevention grants, 46 percent of their drug education grants and 40
percent of their law enforcement grants.
   Overall, the three block grant programs sent $5 billion to the
states from October 1986 through June 1990.
   Only $3.4 billion, or 68 percent, of that amount was distributed
during that time by state and territorial governments to anti-drug
programs, the figures show.
   ``Obviously I'd like to see it higher, but I'm not prepared to
say they're not doing their jobs,'' Carnes said.
   Among the states, top-ranked Arizona spent 83.4 percent of the
$77.7 million it received. Second was Nevada, spending 79 percent
of $26.7 million, followed by the U.S. territories, which spent 77
percent of $63.3 million.
   Trailing the list, Puerto Rico spent only 34.2 percent of the
$31.7 million it received, Hawaii spent 52 percent of $27.4 million
and Wyoming 55 percent of $14.1 million.
   Hawaii Attorney General Warren Price said county prosecutors and
police departments in the state use county funds for anti-drug
efforts and later seek reimbursement from the federal grants. He
said this sets up a time lag that makes it look as if the federal
funds aren't being spent quickly.
   The drug policy office said in the report that it opposes giving
such grants directly to cities on grounds that doing so would place
too heavy a paperwork and administrative burden on the federal
government.
   ``Instead of speeding up the process, the time required at the
federal level to review thousands of applications from local
governments would almost certainly slow it down,'' it said in the
report.
   States ``are closer to the problem than federal administrators
and can more quickly react to changes in local requirements,'' it
added.
   Governors oppose giving the money directly to cities, but mayors
complain that the states fail to send the money to the places that
need it the most.
   Former New York City police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy said
mayors believe that while recreational users in the suburbs may be
driving the drug problem, the most severe crisis is elsewhere.
   ``The worst problems - the murder and violence among the kids
who get into the traffic and the delays for treatment for
low-income people who don't have health insurance - are in the
cities,'' said Murphy, who directs the U.S. Conference of Mayors'
police policy board.

   These are the latest developments in the Persian Gulf crisis:
   ---
   About 16,000 sailors and Marines were to begin leaving U.S.
ports Friday for the gulf aboard 17 ships, including the aircraft
carriers America and Theodore Roosevelt from the Norfolk Naval Base
in Virginia. Three aircraft carriers are already in the Middle
East. The deployment of so many U.S. warships to one part of the
world is unprecedented since the Vietnam War.
   ---
   The Pentagon was reportedly planning inoculations for troops
against biological warfare. The New York Times reported Friday that
the inoculations could begin ``within a matter of weeks.'' Army Lt.
Col. Steve Roy, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, refused
to comment on the report, which quoted unidentified administration
officials.
   ---
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu urged U.S. officials on
Friday to hold talks with Iraq to avert a war, Kyodo News Service
reported. Kaifu made a similar request in a letter to Saddam
Hussein on Wednesday, in which he also called for the immediate
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   ---
   More than 250 Soviets left Iraq for home, and Soviet Deputy
Premier Igor Belousov met with Iraqi leaders in Baghdad seeking an
agreement to terminate Soviet companies' contracts with Iraq,
officials reported. The Soviets left on an Aeroflot airliner
shortly after midnight. About 1,000 others will be airlifted by
Soviet and Iraqi airliners by Jan. 10.

   The Pentagon said today it plans to begin
vaccinating U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf against possible germ
warfare.
   The vaccinations are part of a plan to protect U.S. troops
against the possibility that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein may use
chemical or biological weapons if war breaks out.
   ``We are committed to providing maximum protection for our
troops, including protection against chemical and biological
weapons,'' said a brief Pentagon statement.
   ``We expect to begin a program of inoculations soon,'' it said.
The statement did not provide further details, and a spokeswoman
said more may be available later in the day.
   The New York Times reported in its Friday editions that senior
administration officials recommended the inoculations as part of a
broader plan that also includes the use of masks and other
protective garments.
   CIA Director William Webster said recently that Iraq has a large
stockpile of biological weapons. Saddam has repeatedly denied it.
   Iraq used chemical weapons against some rebellious Kurds in its
own country and against Iran during its war with that country.
   As a result, U.S. troops in the Gulf have been given protective
clothing and have undergone training on how to protect themselves
against an attack of poison gas.
   The Times said it was unclear how many troops might be
vaccinated.
   The administration plans to deploy more than 400,000 troops in
the region, and all are expected to be in place within several
weeks.
   The Times said the inoculations could begin ``in a matter of
weeks.''
   Biological weapons are based on living agents like viruses and
bacteria, and they cause diseases such as typhoid and cholera.

<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ramsewak Shankar and his
Cabinet have presented their resignations to parliament, which is
expected to name a new president and vice president by Saturday.
   As the country's elected parliamentarians somberly sat in
silence Thursday night, Vice President Henck Arron handed the
resignations to National Assembly President Jaggernath Lachmon.
Arron said the Cabinet had already resigned.
   The armed forces of this nation in northern South America
overthrew Shankar without bloodshed on Monday and urged the
parliament to elect new chief executives and hold national
elections within 100 days.
   Lachman asked Shankar and Arron to remain in office until their
resignations were formally accepted, which is expected Saturday
despite domestic and international condemnation of the military
overthrow.
   Cmdr. Ivan Graanoogst, the acting army chief, claimed on
Thursday that the military's overthrow of Shankar allowed by the
constitution. He denied the takeover was a military coup.
   The new chief executive will appoint a Cabinet and set a date
for national elections to be held within three months, military
leaders said.
   Guido Grooscors, Venezuela's ambassador to the Organization of
American States, whose members include Suriname, called the
takeover a ``severe violation of the principles of the OAS
charter.''
   The 13-nation Caribbean Community, known as Caricom, issued a
statement by its chairman, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley,
expressing ``dismay and outrage'' and demanding full restoration of
democracy in the former Dutch colony of 400,000 people.
   Manley said otherwise Caricom members may ``reconsider the
future relationship with Suriname and the Caribbean Community.''
Suriname does not belong to Caricom.
   The first public criticism at home was contained in an editorial
published Thursday by the daily newspaper De Ware Tyd.
   ``Reduced to its essentials, the army has simply imposed its
will on the government,'' the newspaper said.
   The Council of Labor Union Federations, which represents
organized labor in Suriname, issued a statement rejecting the
army's interpretation of the constitution, approved approved by a
plebiscite in 1987. The council noted that its objection was in
spite of its displeasure with the Shankar government.
   Graanoogst became acting army chief Saturday after military
strongman Desi Bouterse resigned in a dispute with Shankar.
Bouterse, as chairman of the five-commander Military Authority,
remains the most powerful figure in the country.
   Bouterse came to power after a 1980 military coup deposed Arron,
then president. Bouterse headed a military dictatorship that ruled
the Georgia-sized nation until parliamentary elections were held in
1987.
   Shankar's three-party coalition, the Front for Democracy and
Development, won by a landslide. The assembly elected him in 1988
to a five-year term as president.
   Shankar's overthrow coincided with growing popular discontent
with his government's inability to revive the economy, beset by
high inflation and unemployment. The government has a monthly trade
deficit of $10 million.
   The economic decline began during Bouterse's rule. Major factors
included a fall in prices for bauxite, the country's main export,
and guerrilla attacks that disrupted bauxite and aluminum
production.
   The Netherlands suspended the development aid in 1982 after the
massacre of 15 opposition leaders while in military detention.
Bouterse had accused them of plotting his overthrow.

<HEAD>Minnesota Drug Law Ruled Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state law providing for a four-year
sentence for first-time crack users and probation for first-time
users of powdered cocaine is racially biased - and thus
unconstitutional, a judge has ruled.
   Hennepin County District Judge Pamela Alexander ruled Thursday
that state sentencing guidelines are flawed, saying there is no
logical reason why people convicted for possession crack should be
treated any differently from those convicted of possessing any
other form of cocaine.
   Assistant Hennepin County attorney Chuck Sweetland said if the
ruling issued Thursday is upheld, it could affect 100 cases in his
county alone. It will be appealed to the state Supreme Court, he
said.
   ``If this isn't reversed, it is going to make it impossible to
prosecute the vast majority of urban crack cases,'' Sweetland said.
   Attorneys for five suspects who challenged the crack law said 92
percent of people arrested on charges of possession of crack in
1988 were black, while 85 percent of people arrested on charges of
possessing powdered cocaine were white. Crack is cocaine in the
form of highly purified, pebble-like nuggets that can be smoked.
   ``Cocaine is cocaine,'' the judge said in her ruling. ``So
regardless of the form that it's in, it should be treated the same,
and all persons charged under that should be treated the same
regardless of whether they're black, white, pink or purple.''
   Under the statute, which took effect Aug. 1, 1989, the
recommended punishment for a first offender convicted of crack
possession is a four-year prison term but possession of cocaine
calls for only probation.
   State Rep. Randy Kelly, one of the legislators who drafted the
tougher sentencing for crack, said he was stunned by the judge's
ruling.
   ``We never ever considered that it was going to be applied
unequally to people of color or whatever,'' Kelly said. ``Our major
concerns were its potency, its absolutely devastating influence on
people, its cheapness and its attractiveness in terms o  selling to
children. Those were the concerns.''
   Alexander's ruling is binding only in Hennepin County unless it
is affirmed by an appellate court, according to James E. Konen,
head of the Criminal Division for the Ramsey County Attorney's
Office.
   Until the high court rules, no convicted user will be freed. But
Sweetland said about 15 suspects awaiting trial in Hennepin County
could get out of jail immediately.
   A Supreme Court decision is not expected for several months.

and his brother, Josh, 2, in Back Creek near Hedgesville. The
search had been called off during the night because of heavy snow
and strong current in the creek.
   Rescuers decided to resume out of fear that the creek would
swell even more when the snow begins to melt, police Cpl. Dennis
Streets said.
   The bodies of the boys' parents, grandfather and stepbrother
were recovered up to 2 miles downstream from the bridge.
   The family was returning from a Christmas visit to relatives in
Baltimore when the car fell off the bridge early Wednesday, said
Preston Gooden, Berkeley County sheriff. The creek, swollen by
recent rain and snow to twice its normal depth of 4 feet, is over
the bridge's surface.
   A motorist noticed the car submerged in the creek Wednesday
afternoon and called police. The driver's window was open,
suggesting the passengers may have climbed out, Gooden said.
   Searchers found the body of the boys' grandfather, Richard
Wiesner, 62, late Thursday night. Earlier they found the bodies of
the boys' parents, Laurie Wiesner, 30, and Chris Wiesner Sr., 31,
and their stepbrother, George Hall, 10.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Pennsylvania would assume some
control over Philadelphia's spending under a new plan to rescue the
city from bankruptcy.
   The proposal outlined Thursday by City Treasurer Benjamin
Blakney calls for creation of an oversight authority that would
borrow money to cover a $229.5 million shortfall in the fiscal year
ending June 30.
   The city would be required to provide ``assurances that the
means are in hand to prevent deficits in the future,'' he said.
   Blakney presented the plan during testimony before the City
Council's new Select Committee on Fiscal Stability and
Intergovernmental Cooperation.
   The committee's chairman, Councilman John F. Street, said the
authority would be granted additional powers if Philadelphia proved
unable to balance its budget after the deficit was eliminated.
   Details of an oversight body would be determined by the state
Legislature, which convenes next week but won't get down to
business until the last week of January.
   ``In the weeks ahead, we will be urging all involved parties to
support the creation of a new authority that can provide and
control the borrowing capacity ... of the city,'' Blakney said.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode, City Controller Jonathan A. Saidel and
other Democratic leaders have urged creation of an oversight entity
whose powers would be triggered if the city failed to pass
realistically balanced budgets.
   A consortium of banks, in loan negotiations with the city, last
week put forth a recovery plan that would create an independent
board with line-item veto power over city spending.
   In recent weeks, the city has sought to sell up to $300 million
in short-term notes to local banks and two pension boards to keep
essential bills paid through winter.
   Banks have trimmed the request to $150 million, which would
allow the city to meet its payroll but not pay all its debts to
suppliers and service providers, while a long-term solution to the
city's fiscal ills is worked out.
   Goode said Wednesday that the city would not be able to pay
employees a full salary after next week.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar today
opened talks with a Sikh leader aimed at ending a 7-year-old
secessionist conflict in Punjab that has claimed thousands of
lives.
   The talks were the most serious attempt at discussing the
dispute since a peace accord between the Sikhs and the government
collapsed in 1986.
   The meeting follows a conference two days ago by three rival
Sikh political groups that authorized a Sikh leader, Simranjit
Singh Mann, to meet the prime minister to negotiate
self-determination for the wealthy northern state.
   Mann, a former police officer who was accused of plotting the
1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, said he would
try to broaden the talks to include outlawed militant
organizations.
   ``We want to involve the militants. They are the ones who are
laying down their lives,'' Mann said, reached by telephone before
meeting the prime minister.
   Mann told journalists before entering the prime minister's
residence that he had come with the mandate for securing the right
of self-determination for the people of Punjab.
   On Thursday, the five-member Panthic committee controlling the
most powerful extremist groups issued a statement that it would
consider talks with the government if a venue and agenda could be
agreed. The group is said to control the most powerful extremist
groups.
   The statement reportedly suggested talks in Geneva or the United
Nations.
   It said Pakistan should act as an observer in the talks.
Pakistan supports the Sikhs' political claims but denies
allegations by India that it also provides aid and shelter to the
militants.
   The prime minister has ruled out independence for Punjab, but he
says he's willing to negotiate constitutional amendments to
overcome Sikh grievances.
   Mann declined to predict the results of the talks or say how
long they will last. He also refused to say if he would consider a
moratorium on violence while the talks were under way.
   Mann served five years in prison on sedition charges and was to
stand trial for conspiracy in Mrs. Gandhi's murder when he was
elected to Parliament in 1989. Charges against him were dropped by
the government of Rajiv Gandhi, Mrs. Gandhi's son, and he was
released from jail.
   Punjab has been under federal rule since 1987, when a campaign
of assassination and intimidation intensified against Hindus and
Sikh moderates.
   Unofficial accounts say the militants have killed more than
3,260 people in the past year. The toll makes 1990 the bloodiest
year since the extremists began their campaign to separate from
India in 1983.
   Sikhs say they are targets of discrimination in this
Hindu-dominated country, where they comprise 2 percent of the 880
million population.

   A judge ordered the body of an infant who
died in 1983 exhumed after her 23-year-old mother confessed to
suffocating her and also killing two other children since then.
   Diane L. Spencer of Wayland, Mich., is being held in the Allegan
County (Mich.) Jail charged with first-degree murder in the
September death of her 6-month-old son Aaron A. Spencer.
   From Michigan, she wrote to Pennsylvania authorities to protest
the planned exhumation of her daughter Joyce A. Donochick, who died
in 1983 at age 6 weeks. Parts of the letter were read aloud in
court Thursday. But Clearfield County Judge John Reilly Jr. ruled
nevertheless that Joyce's body should be examined by forensic
pathologists.
   ``I believe this to be totally unnecessary at this point and am
willing to do whatever I myself or authorities in Pennsylvania deem
necessary to prevent the exhumation,'' Spencer wrote.
   Wayland police Chief Dan Millerhas said Spencer admitted
smothering the boy and also confessed to killing Joyce in 1983 and
another daughter, 17-day-old Autumn Dawn Spencer, in 1987.
   Clearfield County Coroner R. Joel Heath said Joyce's body would
be exhumed within two weeks. A woman in the Clearfield County
district attorney's office who refused to identify herself said
today that investigators were also reviewing records of an autopsy
done after the death of Autumn Spencer, who lived in Clearfield
County but was pronounced dead at a hospital in neighboring Centre
County.
   At the time, authorities believed the children died of sudden
infant death syndrome.
   Pennsylvania authorities have not filed charges related to the
deaths of Spencer's daughters.
   A first-degree murder conviction in Pennsylvania carries a
possible sentence of death in the electric chair.
   At the time of Aaron's death three months ago, the child's
father was in jail on drug charges, authorities said.

   Chun Doo-hwan, the disgraced former
president, will return to his house in the capital over the
weekend, ending his two-year rural exile in a remote temple, aides
said today.
   Chun's aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he will
leave the 14th century Buddhist temple in the eastern mountains on
Sunday.
   A dissidents' association in southern Kwangju issued a statement
saying the people would not accept Chun's return. ``We warn against
restoration of a suppressive rule following the former president's
comeback.''
   Dissidents have asked the government to prosecute Chun,
contending he ordered the military to crush a 1980 pro-democracy
uprising in Kwangju. By official count, about 200 people were
killed in the uprising.
   Kwangju is a major stronghold of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung.
   Kim said he would not oppose Chun's return, but he told the
former president to stay out of politics.
   Chun and his wife, Lee Soon-ja, went into exile in the
Paektam-sam temple in November 1988 after apologizing for abuses
during his authoritarian rule, which began in 1980.
   When Chun left Seoul, he said the house and other properties
would be turned over to the government to atone for wrongoing.
President Roh Tae-woo has said Chun should be allowed to live in
his old house.
   Roh sent one of his secretaries to the temple to discuss Chun's
future after stating on Monday that he hoped the former president
would return home.
   Roh, a former general who helped Chun seize power in 1980, has
appealed to the nation for mercy for Chun. A dozen of Chun's
relatives and associates have been convicted of corruption and
imprisoned since Roh took office in February 1988.

   Nine-month-old twin girls, joined from the
chest to the navel, died in their mother's arms at home after
suffering from pneumonia.
   Doctors had said the outlook for their health was uncertain when
Shaneka and Shanell Florence - who shared a liver and fused hearts
- were born March 23. They died Wednesday as their father looked
on.
   Yolunda Florence, the Siamese twins' 20-year-old mother, said
the girls recently caught pneumonia. The babies also suffered from
cyanotic heart disease, or ``blue baby syndrome,'' stemming from
abnormal blood flow through the hearts. It prevented them from
getting enough oxygen.
   Yolunda Florence and her 22-year-old husband, Lister, each
dropped out of school to care for their daughters when they became
ill last month. Yolunda is expecting another child in two months.
   ``Shanell and Shaneka taught me to be happy with whatever you

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie, the novelist condemned
to death by Iran for allegedly blaspheming Islam, believes a ``time
for healing'' will enable him to emerge from hiding, according to
an interview released today.
   His comments to the United News of India were among a series of
attempts this week aimed at ending his isolation. Rushdie on Monday
affirmed his belief in Islam and said he would not support a
paperback printing or further translations of his novel, ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   However, a religious leader in Iran responded by saying the
nation would not lift the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call to
kill Rushdie for his novel, which they said blasphemes Islam.
   In a guest editorial today in The Times of London and The New
York Times, Rushie said he regretted ``the renewed threats from
Tehran and cannot help wondering why the British government seems
no longer to feel any need to respond to such threats.''
   The Indian news agency quoted Rushdie as saying: ``Gradually,
good will can replace ill will. There is a feeling that enough has
been done (to me).''
   ``Most Moslems are not violent or bloodthirsty. Though Moslems
throughout the world now know me by name, relatively few Moslems
know what sort of person I am, and they could be willing to listen
to me,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Rushdie, a British national who was born in India, went into
hiding in Britain in February 1989 after the death call.
   He has emerged in recent weeks for a television interview in
London and has showed up unannounced at a London bookshop to
autograph copies of his newest book, ``Haroun and the Sea of
Stories.''
   In the interview with United News of India, Rushdie was quoted
as saying: ``I don't think I can call myself a good Moslem, but I
am Moslem and I believe in the oneness of God and the central
tenets of the Prophet's teaching.''
   While many Moslems in Britain have denounced Rushdie, he
asserted that ``there is a silent majority which feels the matter
must be brought to an end,'' United News said.
   Rushdie noted ``Haroun and the Sea of Stories'' had been
well-received in his native India, adding perhaps the change that
enables him to come out of hiding can start in India.
   ``There's something new to talk about - that is the process of
healing, and it's particularly important to talk to Indian Moslems
- that's where I came from, and if that is where it began, it can
be one of the palces where the ending can come from,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   Predominantly Hindu India, where tensions with the Moslem
minority periodically erupt into deadly riots, was one of the first
nations to ban ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Within a few weeks, at least 19 people were killed as riots over
the book started in Rushdie's hometown of Bombay and
Indian-governed Kashmir and spread to neighboring Pakistan.

<HEAD>Record Immigration in December, Housing Shortage Looming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A surge in the number of Soviet Jews
immigrating to Israel in December will give the Jewish state its
highest monthly total of immigrants in its 42-year history, an
Israeli official said today.
   The influx of 40,000 Jews this month - 35,000 of them from the
Soviet Union - is intensifying a major housing crisis, said Simha
Dinitz, head of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency. Dinitz urged
the government to take over construction to resolve the crisis.
   The pace of immigration has accelerated in recent weeks because
of increasing uncertainty in the Soviet Union and better
transportation arrangements by Israel, Dinitz told a news
conference.
   December will be ``a record month in the history of immigration
in Israel,'' said Dinitz, whose agency assists the Israeli
government in transporting and resettling immigrants.
   The government expects more than 200,000 immigrants this year,
about 90 percent of them Soviets. The total will be second only to
1949, when more than 239,000 immigrants arrived in the new state.
   Soviets have been pouring into Israel since spring 1989, when
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government eased its policy on
exit permits.
   Dinitz said that discussions with newly arrived Soviets showed
that ``the question of lack of stability, the disintegration of the
(Soviet) system, is the thing that worries them most.''
   In addition, he said, Israel has improved its transport
arrangements via Budapest, Bucharest and Warsaw.
   He said the housing crisis was created because the construction
planned by the government had not been carried out.
   Dinitz said, for example, that government budgeted for 45,000
new housing units this year, but that only 27,000 had been started.
Not one of the 15,000 planned prefabricated homes has been erected,
he said, and only 950 of 30,000 mobile homes have been moved into
place.
   He predicted ``a difficult situation for the next 10 to 12
months'' and urged the government should take over construction.
   Dinitz said he did not believe the newcomers would have to be
housed in tents, as some Israeli officials have said. Instead, he
said, Israel will have to make use of ``every available space'' in
hotels, collective farms, army camps and public buildings.
   He said Israel estimates there are 3 million to 3.5 million Jews
in the Soviet Union, about 1 million higher than Soviet estimates,
and that as many as 2.2 million could come to Israel.
   He said more than 200,000 have arrived over the past two years
and that 1 million more already have Israeli invitations to
immigrate.
   ``We are already working on the second million,'' Dinitz said.
``I think easily another million is in the pipeline provided no
catastrophe happens.''
   Israel has a total population of 4.56 million people, including
3.7 million Jews and 840,000 Israeli Arabs, the people and
descendants of the people who stayed within Israel's boundaries
when the state was founded in 1948.

   The bill was mailed March 6, 1940.
   ``It just goes to show that a piece of mail, no matter how old

   Zaken said the postcard, which bears a New York postmark and
metered postage for 1 cent, probably was caught in a piece of

<HEAD>Barry Bows Out As Washington Mayor After Humbling Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By any measure, 1990 was a terrible year for
Mayor Marion Barry. It began with his videotaped arrest in a drug
sting, and saw him convicted of cocaine possession and defeated for
a lesser office. And in the end, his wife moved out on him.
   Barry, once one of the nation's most prominent and promising
black politicians, is set to leave office on Jan. 2 unemployed and
with a six-month jail sentence hanging over his head.
   But the former civil rights worker, who has relished the
underdog's role in a 30-year career in the public eye, insists his
chin is up - even after being forced to abandon plans to run for a
fourth, four-year term and suffering a humiliating defeat in his
bid instead for a city council seat.
   ``Some people would be sad, other people would be disappointed
... sort of downcast,'' Barry said in an interview. ``I feel
relieved. Some people would feel regret, but that's not here with
me - maybe it ought to be, but it's not.''
   But detractors and supporters alike can't help but wonder at the
promising future once held by a man who left behind the bleak
poverty of his boyhood in Itta Bena, Miss., to become a foot
soldier in the civil rights movement and later the unrivaled star
of Washington's local politics.
   ``He had his life together beautifully at one time, but he's
blown it, and he blew it in this last term,'' said Max Berry, a
former Barry supporter who directed the mayor's 1986 re-election
effort. ``He did a lot of good things in those first seven years
that no one will remember, and he's the reason that his own life is
in disarray.''
   Longtime supporter Calvin Rolark, a local community activist,
said Barry is ``a success story, because he showed what true black
leadership can be about.''
   ``At the same time, he showed the effect of drugs on
individuals, no matter how strong people are,'' Rolark said. ``I
think the history of Marion Barry will show that you can go from a
law maker to a law breaker.''
   Dissident black Roman Catholic priest George Stallings described
Barry's legal travails as ``a national tragedy,'' but insisted that
the mayor should be remembered for his wide range of
accomplishments, particularly the development of a minority
contracting procedure that generates more than $600 million
annually for businesses owned by African-Americans, Hispanics and
other groups.
   ``On that front, Marion Barry took the city to a new level, and
that was a great example to other municipalities,'' Stallings said.
``He was a very strong leader, and that should not be forgotten
either.''
   Barry was both relaxed and reflective as he prepared to leave
the job he has held for a dozen years, but he demonstrated none of
the braggadocio that used to be his trademark. The mayor, who has
admitted to alcoholism, addiction to prescription drugs and
occasional cocaine use, credits his recovery program with taking
the blunt edges off his personality.
   ``This isn't like death,'' Barry said of his departure from the
local political scene. ``I've gotten ready for this, and I look
back and say, `Someone's going to take over ... I won't have that
awesome responsibility anymore,' and in some ways that is nice. I
have more perspective now.''
   Barry stressed his contributions to the city, including his
minority contracting plan, a downtown development boom, senior
citizen and youth programs, and the order he initially brought to
the city's chaotic financial books. But he admits that in recalling
his career, many will think first of his legal troubles.
   ``I believe that in time, my personal situation will evaporate
from people's minds and they will finally get around to the good
things I did here,'' Barry said. ``But that's what people will
remember for awhile, and you can't stop that.''
   The mayor also said he can cope with the prospect of spending
time in prison if he fails in the appeal of his cocaine possession
conviction and subsequent six-month sentence.
   ``If it happens, it happens - I'll do the six months and move
on,'' Barry said quietly. Not that I like the prospects of it, but
I've learned that I can't change that, and I may have to do it,
come out and start again.''
   How did Barry's downfall begin? Berry, his former campaign
director, says ``I think that he partied a lot, drank too much, got
on the dope, and did too many crony deals, really just fell in with
the wrong people.''
   ``Maybe in the future, if he stays clean, he will learn to pick
his friends better,'' Berry said.
   Sharon Pratt Dixon's landslide victory in the race to succeed
Barry was seen as a stunning repudiation of the mayor, whose love
for the trappings of power contrasted sharply with Dixon's pledge
for a simple, no-nonsense government.
   And as Dixon prepares to tackle problems that include a massive
municipal budget deficit, record murder rate and other woes, Barry
turns his attention from those difficulties to the problem of
finding a job.
   ``I'm not anxious about the future, I'm not panicky about it,''
said Barry, who has no firm plans beyond a handful of speaking
engagements. ``One thing is for sure - I won't be sitting on the
sidelines like a little mayor, commenting on everything the new
administration does.''
   Barry's wife Effi moved out of their home with son Christopher
last month after sitting in her husband's trial all summer and
listening to a lurid string of tales that detailed his alleged drug
use and womanizing.
   ``This whole thing has been hard on all of us - hard on me, hard
on her, and hard on Christopher,'' Barry said. ``But she and I are
friends, and we have an understanding. We'll work something out.''
   Despite the mayor's recent setbacks, those who have known him
over the years believe the strengths that have marked his career -
a sharp mind combined with disarming charm - may lead to good
things in the future.
   ``I'm very sad about this, because of what he has done to
himself, and by extension, to the city,'' Berry said. ``But you
know, something about him makes me want to like him, even now, even
though I know he's a scoundrel.''

<HEAD>Riegle Asks Treasury Department To Study Insurance Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Keating Five'' Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. is
asking the Treasury Department to study the condition of the
insurance industry, warning that the nation cannot afford to ignore
the development of problems similar to the savings and loan
debacle.
   Riegle, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, asked
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to have his aides examine
whether insurance companies have made too many risky investments in
commercial real estate and other slumping sectors.
   He asked the department to look into whether state guaranty
funds are adequate to protect customers from insurance company
defaults and to estimate the risk to the economy of a major
insurance company failure.
   He also sought to determine whether consumers can get enough
information to identify high-risk insurance companies and to
recommend whether federal regulation of insurance is needed.
   ``I believe that the recent history of the savings and loan and
commercial banking industries makes clear that the federal
government cannot afford to ignore serious problems in any industry
that lies close to the heart of the American economy,'' Riegle
wrote in a letter dated Dec. 20 and released Thursday.
   He asked that the Treasury Department report back by Sept. 1. A
Treasury spokeswoman said the department was considering the
request.
   On Dec. 10, Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, began a series of
hearings examining whether state regulation of insurance has been
adequate. He chairs the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust,
monopolies and business rights.
   Riegle is one of five senators being probed by the Senate Ethics
Committee for intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf
of Charles H. Keating Jr., former head of the failed Lincoln
Savings and Loan.
   Riegle, who like the other senators has denied any wrongdoing,
received $78,250 in contribution funds from Keating and his
associates. He later returned the money.

<HEAD>Deadlock Persists Over U.S.-Iraq Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today charged Iraq
with blocking progress on setting up talks to deal with its
annexation of Kuwait.
   Joseph C. Wilson IV, the senior U.S. diplomat in Baghdad, did
not discuss the situation for a second day in a row with Iraqi
foreign ministry officials, Mark Dillen, a State Department
spokesman, said.
   Wilson had been in almost daily contact with Deputy Foreign
Minister Nizar Hamdoon or other Iraqi officials.
   ``Iraq continues to block any progress toward setting dates for
an exchange of visits,'' Dillen said.
   He referred to the stalled proposal by President Bush for Iraq
to send Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz here and then for Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to go to Baghdad to see President Saddam
Hussein.
   The cutoff for a Baker trip to Iraq is Jan. 3. That is 12 days
before the deadline the U.N. Security Council set last month for
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or to risk a military clash with the
United States and its allies.
   Iraq had invited Baker to visit Jan. 12, but he refused, saying
it was too close to the deadline for withdrawal.
   Baker is on vacation in Houston and is expected to return to
Washington Jan. 1. He has meetings scheduled with Bush on Jan. 2
and Jan. 4, officials said.
   Meanwhile, Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat, the Iraqi ambassador to
Washington, did not return to his post today after consultations in
Baghdad. Other Iraqi ambassadors had been called home, as well.
   U.S. and Iraqi officials said Mashat was expected in Washington
this weekend or early next week.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Signal Protracted Slump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge plunged in November, the fifth consecutive monthly drop, and
analysts said it signaled increased joblessness and a slump
extending until late next year.
   ``The basic message is there's no light down there in the tunnel
that we can see,'' said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The recession is clearly in place and
clearly has further to go,'' he said.
   Friday's announcement of the November decline of 1.2 percent in
the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Indicators was the
latest in a spate of gloomy news about economic conditions last
month.
   Unemployment jumped to a three-year high of 5.9 percent. New
orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable goods such as
automobiles and appliances plunged 10.5 percent, matching the worst
decline on record. Consumer spending and income growth was
virtually flat, and construction of single-family homes fell to the
lowest level since 1982.
   Analysts said the latest drop in the leading index, designed to
forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance, offered
almost no hope that the economy will revive soon.
   Less than three weeks ago, most private analysts believed the
economy, having entered a recession in the fourth quarter of this
year, would begin to grow again next spring.
   The November decline in the leading index followed a 1.3 percent
drop in October, the steepest since the month after the October
1987 stock market crash.
   The decline left the index at 139.7 percent of its 1982 base of
100, down 4.4 percent from its 146.2 peak in June. It has been the
worst multiple-month retreat by the index since 1981, at the start
of the last recession.
   ``The November indicators leave no doubt that a serious and
lengthy recession is under way,'' said economist William K.
MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``... This is good
evidence that the current recession will last at least through the
third quarter of 1991 - longer than could have been foreseen just
weeks ago.''
   ``It means a continuous drop in jobs throughout most of next
year and a rise in the unemployment rate to about 7.5 percent,'' he
said. ``That's a loss of more than a million jobs from where we are
now.''
   Top administration officials, including President Bush, have
been reluctant to label the slump as a recession. But on Thursday
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee, said, ``We will, in fact, have a recession,'' and warned
the unemployment rate could go as high as 8 percent.
   However, analyst Samuel Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc. the
nation's economic prospects may not be as bleak if the Persian Gulf
crisis is resolved early in the year.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring and the
confidence of American consumers plummeting. That, in turn has
caused sharp pullback by businesses, he said.
   ``If the war is settled, we might get a boost in consumer
confidence, which could turn the whole thing around rather
quickly,'' he said.
   In November, eight of the 11 forward-looking components of the
Commerce Department's index fell.
   Pulling it down were a jump in new claims for unemployment
benefits and declines in new orders to factories for consumer
goods, prices of raw materials, the backlog of unfilled orders at
factories, new orders for business investment equipment, the length
of the average workweek, the inflation-adjusted money supply and
building permits.
   The only positive contributors were an increase in stock prices,
a slowing in business delivery times and a slight improvement in
consumer confidence.

   Less than three weeks from a U.N. deadline for Iraq to leave
Kuwait or face possible attack, the U.S. Navy began beefing up its
forces in the Persian Gulf and 16,000 sailors and Marines had
orders today to leave for the region.
   A day earlier, President Bush dismissed reports that the United
States is still weeks away from being ready to mount a full
military strike. Officials were quoted today as saying Bush favors
a quick war to save American lives.
   Because such a conflict could involve the use of biological
weapons, the Pentagon said today it plans to inoculate American
troops against them.
   Such weapons could be launched at the U.S.-led forces by
missiles, and for the second time this week Iraq test fired a
surface-to-surface missile today.
   The U.S. Central Command in Saudi Arabia reported that the
missle was fired away from multinational forces so that it landed
within Iraq.
   ``The firing appeared to be part of an additional testing or
training mission,'' said Air Force Lt. Casey Mahon, a Central
Command spokesman.
   Military analysts also said today that thousands of Iraqis have
been trained for suicide attacks on U.S.-led multinational forces
if war breaks out.
   In other developments:
   -President Bush today ordered forgiveness of Egypt's $7 billion
in military debts as a reward for its cooperation with the U.S.
efforts against Iraq. Bush cited U.S. national security interests
and said the action was necessary for ``the success of Desert
Shield,'' the code name for the U.S. gulf forces.
   -The Bush administration today charged Iraq with blocking
progress on setting up talks on the gulf crisis. The dispute over
dates has prevented Secretary of State James A. Baker III from
meeting with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   The 16,000 sailors and Marines were scheduled to begin leaving
U.S. ports for the gulf today aboard 17 ships, including the
aircraft carriers America and Theodore Roosevelt from the Norfolk
Naval Base in Virginia.
   Navy officials said it should be a two-week voyage, meaning the
ships would arrive before the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline. Aircraft
carriers on station in the Middle East region are the USS Saratoga
in the eastern Mediterranean, the USS Midway in the Arabian Sea and
the USS John F. Kennedy in the Red Sea.
   The deployment of such a large number of U.S. warships to one
part of the world is unprecedented since the Vietnam War.
   More than 400,000 U.S. troops are expected to be deployed by
mid-February, as well as about 100,000 from other nations. Iraq,
which invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, has more than 500,000 troops in
southern Iraq and in Kuwait.
   The New York Times reported today that inoculations of soliders
against biological weapons could begin ``within a matter of
weeks.'' A Pentagon Statement released today confirmed the account.
   ``We are committed to providing maximum protection for our
troops, including protection against chemical and biological
weapons,'' the statement said. It did not say when the vaccinations
would begin.
   Saddam has denied having biological weapons, based on viruses
and bacteria that can spread diseases such as typhoid and cholera.
Iraq has used chemical weapons against its Kurdish population and
against Iran.
   Lt. Gen. Calvin Waller said last week he did not believe the
United States was prepared for a full attack on Jan. 15. Several
media reports says that view has wide support among the military.
   But Bush said Thursday: ``Don't believe those reports you're
reading'' and noted he was ``very comfortable'' with U.S. firepower
on hand in the region.
   He also said there had been ``no progress'' on settling a
disagreement over dates for a proposed meeting between Saddam and
Baker. The Iraqis have insisted on Jan. 12 talks, but Bush said
there would be ``no compromise'' on the U.S. position of talks no
later than Jan. 3.
   Should negotiations fail, Bush favors a quick attack, according
to senior government officials quoted in today's Los Angeles Times.
The officials said Bush believes a prompt strike will reduce
American casualties.
   Asian military analysts in Baghdad, meanwhile, said Iraq has
been training army commandos and volunteers for special operations
against the allied forces. The training includes sea and airborne
suicide missions, they said.
   A senior Iraqi Baath Party official told Iraq's government
Al-Jouhouriya newspaper that 138,700 volunteers had completed
courses at a military camp in Najaf, Iraq, 90 miles south of
Baghdad, since the gulf crisis began.

   Vanna White bought a marriage license in
this celebrity-filled ski resort, but she didn't provide a clue
about when she'll say ``I DO.''
   With a scarf wrapped tightly around her head, the 33-year-old
``Wheel of Fortune'' letter-turner and her boyfriend, Brooklyn
native George Santo Pietro, 44, picked up the $20 license Thursday
at the Pitkin County Courthouse.
   No one recognized White, even after she provided her driver's
license for identification.
   ``I didn't even know who it was,'' said Deputy County Clerk Kim
Schultz, who helped the couple fill out their marriage license
forms.
   Santo Pietro's mother, Catherine Santo Pietro of Plainview,
N.Y., said she was ``delighted, very delighted'' that White will
become part of her family.
   Mrs. Santo Pietro said she had been told of the wedding plans,
but didn't know when it would be. The marriage license is good
anywhere in Colorado for 30 days.
   White was the second celebrity this week to get into the
marriage game at a Colorado ski resort. On Christmas Eve, film star
Tom Cruise and Australian actress Nicole Kidman married in a secret
wedding in Telluride.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Tammy Wynette says a new generation of
performers has helped popularize country music all over again.
   ``The abundance of great new talent ... is changing the
demographics of the listening and buying audience,'' she said in
comments published in the Country Music Association's ``Close-Up''
magazine.
   ``Because of their impact, the audiences are younger and the
consumer dollars at both the record and concert levels have greatly
increased,'' she said in the publication's January issue.
   She cited Mary-Chapin Carpenter, Joe Diffie, Randy Travis, Ricky
Van Shelton, Clint Black, Patty Loveless and Garth Brooks as among
those making an impact.
   Wynette, the first lady of country music, has had such hits as
``Stand by Your Man'' and ``D-I-V-O-R-C-E.''

   LONDON, Ohio (AP) - Johnny Paycheck, who achieved stardom in
1978 with the worker's anthem ``Take This Job and Shove It,'' is
singing the blues to Gov. Richard Celeste in hopes of getting out
of prison.
   Paycheck, whose real name is Donald Eugene Lytle, is serving a
seven-to-9{-year prison term for a shooting in a bar in 1985.
   The singer is asking Celeste to grant him clemency before the
governor leaves office Jan. 15.
   A spokesman for Celeste declined to comment, except to say that
the governor has an ``extremely conservative record in granting
clemency.''
   Paycheck, 51, has served 10 months for aggravated assault,
tampering with evidence and using a handgun. He was convicted for
shooting a fellow bar patron in the head in 1985, injuring him.
   He won't be eligible for parole for five years.
   Highland County Prosecutor Rocky Coss said he has written to the
Ohio Parole Board to object to Paycheck's clemency bid.
   ``He's used his celebrity status all his life to evade the
consequences of the law, both criminal and civil. I think it would
not serve the law to give him clemency due to his celebrity
status,'' Coss said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Police Chief Daryl F. Gates' forthcoming
autobiography will be nothing short of arresting, his publisher
hopes.
   The outspoken chief's work should attract readers because of the
``glamour and charisma'' of the Los Angeles Police Department, said
Stuart Applebaum, spokesman for New York-based Bantam Books.
   Gates' sometimes blustery style has ruffled some feathers. This
year, for example, he told a U.S. Senate hearing that casual drug
users should be shot.
   Gates has received an advance of close to $300,000 for the book,
which Bantam will release in 1992, said Police Department spokesman
Cmdr. William Booth.

   Jose Canseco is striking out with the
homeowners association in his exclusive neighborhood.
   The Oakland Athletics baseball star and his wife, Esther, are
facing foreclosure for skipping $4,264.44 in maintenance fees on
his two estates in the bayfront development of Cocoplum.
   The Cocoplum Homeowners Association charged in a Dec. 14
foreclosure lawsuit filed in Dade Circuit Court that the Cansecos
``have failed or refused to pay their past-due assessments and
charges.''
   Last month, the association placed liens on the homes, valued at
a total of $2.3 million.
   Association officials have refused to comment on the matter.
``This is between Mr. Canseco and the association,'' said Michelle
Gorman, the organization's attorney.
   Canseco, who signed a five-year, $23.5 million contract with the
A's in June, grew up in Miami and returns to Florida during the
offseason.
   No one answered the telephone Friday morning at the office of

   AVIGNON, France (AP) - It hasn't been an easy year for the
leader of France's Communist Party. But Georges Marchais is a
survivor.
   Marchais, who triumphed in a party election last week only to be
laid up by a mild heart attack, walked out of a hospital Friday
after two days of treatment.
   The 70-year-old communist leader played down the attack as ``a
light problem'' and told reporters that ``retirement isn't for
me.'' He then set out for his home in Paris.
   Marchais had been at his vacation home in nearby Robion when he
was stricken. He had been enjoying a holiday after last week's
party congress, where he received 99 percent of the delegates'
votes to serve a new term as party secretary-general. He has led
the party since 1972.
   The victory marked a triumph after a year of criticism by party
reformers for Marchais' failure to change his orthodox views
despite the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.

   The Soviet Union is expected to dramatically
reduce economic aid to Cuba in January, and some legislators say a
re-evaluation of political ties with the longtime ally may be next.
   Cuban leader Fidel Castro has scoffed at President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's 5-year-old reform campaign, and some Soviet deputies
say he continues to foment insurgencies around the world while
ignoring the needs of his people.
   ``Some members of parliament ... are fed up with the export of
revolution. If they (Cubans) continue the so-called `old course,'
we'll let them continue. But foreign aid won't be as it was
before,'' said Nikolai V. Neyland, a member of the Supreme Soviet's
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Officially, the Kremlin is sticking by Castro politically. But
Castro's steadfast refusal of Soviet-type reforms may play a role
when the national Supreme Soviet legislature considers a foreign
aid bill.
   Western experts estimate Soviet economic aid to Cuba at $5
billion a year, and military aid at about $1.5 billion. Soviet
reformers say this is a luxury the country cannot afford when it
can't feed its own people, and cuts are expected in trade talks
beginning next month.
   The foreign aid bill, proposed by Gorbachev, envisions a 75
percent cut in ``gratuitous'' foreign economic aid, apparently
affecting all Soviet allies.
   It would accompany a new policy, starting Jan. 1, requiring
allies to pay convertible currency at world prices for most trade
with the Soviet Union. That would end a practice of giving aid - in
the form of favorable trade terms - to countries such as Cuba,
Vietnam, North Korea and Ethiopia.
   In other changes, the Soviets also are pushing for a thaw in
U.S.-Cuban relations, a 31-year antagonism that nearly led to
nuclear war over the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
   Gorbachev, preaching ``new thinking'' in foreign affairs, said
during a visit to Cuba in 1989 that he rejected Castro's support
for Communist revolutions in countries such as El Salvador, Angola
and Nicaragua.
   Still, the official reason given for the cutback in aid is
economic.
   ``We have given up the state monopoly on foreign trade, given
enterprises the right of access to the international market, given
up ideological-ridden approaches which used to lead to waste of
resources in relations with some countries,'' Gorbachev told the
parliament last week.
   The huge Russian republic, with 90 percent of the country's
exportable energy, is seeking more say over some foreign policy
questions and could lead the way in asking hard questions about
ties with Cuba.
   ``We don't want to interfere in the internal affairs of Cuba.
Cubans must decide for themselves,'' said Yevgeny Kozholkhin,
chairman of the Russian legislature's committee on foreign
relations.
   ``But as we come to any consideration (about aid), we should
just consider what kind of regime we have before us.''
   At some point, ``we must consider human rights,'' he said.
   A hint of anti-Cuban sentiment in the national legislature
emerged in October, when legislator Olzhas Suleimenov took the
floor and criticized Cuba as a ``totalitarian'' state.
   In November, an expose in the reformist daily Komsomolskaya
Pravda reported that Castro has 32 houses, a personal security
force of 9,700, and five children by his ``present wife.'' That
would shock many Cubans, who have been told only that Castro was
divorced 35 years ago.
   The report prompted the Communist Party daily Pravda to run a
response by Cuba's ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jose Ramon
Balaguer Cabrera, calling the report ``lies.''
   Since the fall of hard-line governments in East Europe last
year, Cuba's favored status among Soviet allies has come under
bolder attack. Commentators have questioned the value of the
Kremlin's commitment to a country they say has offered little in
return.
   ``How many more years is the Soviet government going to take
away the `rations' of poverty-stricken peasants in order to
underwrite and maintain the inefficient, militarized economy of
this far-off overseas state?'' asked a commentator in the labor
newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna last month.
   Andrei Kortunov, a staff researcher at the Soviet Institute of
the U.S.A. and Canada, has estimated that more than one quarter of
the $12 billion annual Soviet foreign aid budget in 1989 went to
Cuba.
   Vyacheslav Krestyaninov, an editor of Latin America, a Soviet
monthly, said the new policy would shift the basis of Cuban-Soviet
relations from a political to economic footing.
   But he said decades of Soviet adoration of Castro would not die
so quickly.
   ``I wouldn't call it a split,'' Krestyaninov said. ``It's like a
new agreement in a family. It's still a family.''

   Quayle shot more than 18 holes Thursday at the course in Pebble
Beach. Beach. The Professional Golfers Association in September
ruled the club ineligible for the 1991 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am.
   ``I have a great concern about the vice president of the United
States playing at Cypress Point and not being aware of the
sensitivity of the issue that revolves around it,'' Monterrey
County Supervisor Sam Karas said.
   Quayle couldn't be questioned for reaction because Secret
Service agents kept reporters and photographers off the club's
private grounds.
   But his office in Washington released a statement from Press
Secretary David Beckwith, stating Quayle was ``unaware of the
controversy surrounding the Cypress Point golf course. He has been
assured the club does not discriminate and has never had a policy
of discrimination.''
   However, the statement said, ``The vice president is unwilling
to leave any impression that he condones any form of
discrimination. He has therefore canceled his round of golf
today.'' Quayle is a member of the Burning Tree country club
outside Washington, which has an all-male membership.
   He was returning to his skiing vacation in Colorado before
returning to Washington on Saturday. Quayle will leave Saturday
night for a New Year's visit to the troops in the Persian Gulf.
   Asked how Quayle could be unaware of the highly publicized
controversy involving the club's banning from the national
tournament, his chief of staff Bill Kristol said in a telephone
interview: ``It proves he's not spending time reading the golf
pages.''
   An official who answered the telephone at the club's hotel,
where Quayle was staying, said the staff had been instructed not to
try to contact Quayle's party.
   Golfing with Quayle on Thursday were two Cypress Point Club
members who are prominent officials in the Bush administration -
Donald B. Rice, the Air Force secretary, and Ebersole Gaines, U.S.
Ambasador to the Bahamas.

   Eugene Smith said Friday he had scaled the walls
of Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth II where he could find
his lost love.
   Smith, who had picked up a rock to smash his way into the palace
if the doors and windows were closed, failed to make it.
   Police arrested him Dec. 7 in the palace grounds and charged him
with carrying a piece of masonry without lawful excuse with intent
to destroy Crown property.
   Peter Codner, Smith's attorney, told Bow Street magistrates'
court that the 32-year-old jobless Irishman came to London from
Dublin after becoming infatuated with a woman who claimed to be the
queen's niece, and that his only desire was to find her.
   He called Smith's actions ``strange'' but said that sometimes
people get so profoundly moved that they do peculiar things.
   Smith was conditionally discharged by magistrate Ronald Bartle,
who said if he came before the court again within 12 months he
would have to pay $950.
   ``I met her in Amsterdam about three months ago. Her name is
Julie Craig and she is 24 years old, blonde and beautiful,'' Smith
said after leaving the court.
   ``She made me promise to come back and said she was related to
the queen. I have not been able to make contact with her. I climbed
the walls of the palace grounds in desperation.
   ``If only I could find her I would give her the biggest kiss and
tell her I love her and will love her for ever and ever. She is
wonderful,'' he said.

   HAFR AL-BATIN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - The front line arrayed
against Iraq is a polyglot Arab-Islamic force whose role in the
northern Saudi desert may be merely symbolic.
   As the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline approaches for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait or face possible force, it's still not clear
what part the Arabs would play in a potentially bloody offensive.
   More than 100,000 Saudis, Egyptians, Syrians, vengeful Kuwaitis
and others have joined to confront Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, a
fellow Arab, since he invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Forces from Pakistan, Morocco, Bangladesh, Niger and Senegal
have planted their flags on Saudi soil. Some contingents are little
more than token forces.
   Behind them are about 350,000 American, British and French
troops with the firepower needed to hammer the Iraqis.
   ``If peace doesn't arrive, and if we're ordered by our supreme
commanders, we can teach (Saddam) a lesson he'll never forget,''
boasted Lt. Gen. Khalid bin Sultan, the Saudi prince who commands
the 145,000-member Arab-Islamic force.
   Those are big ifs.
   The Arab alliance is like an orchestra. All the players have
instruments, but some play different notes. Not all of them will
sound ``Charge'' if the U.S.-led multinational force is ordered
into Kuwait.
   The Kuwaitis, of course, want their country back, but they won't
fight in Iraq.
   The Saudis will fight with the United States and its allies if
invited by Kuwait. The Egyptians say they will do what the Saudis
do.
   The Syrians and others have said only that their role here is
defensive and to stop aggression.
   ``It's clear that there are varying levels of commitment in
terms of willingness to use offensive military action to achieve
our objective,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney acknowledged
recently.
   It is also uncertain what the Arab response would be if Saddam
carried out his threat to launch a missile attack on Israel. It
would be difficult for the Syrians and the Saudis to fight Saddam
if he gets into a shootout with the Arabs' main enemy.
   The Arab states who have the most at stake, the ones ``that
really count,'' are the Saudis and the Egyptians, Cheney noted.
   The Saudis have a 75,000-member army and air force; the
Egyptians have pledged 40,000 troops, including two armored
divisions.
   The Egyptians and Syrians, who have sent an armored division
with their 20,000-member contingent, bring combat experience to the
Saudi desert. Both have fought the Israelis, and the Syrians have
been in action in Lebanon.
   The U.S.-equipped Egyptians also trained with American troops in
a 1988 exercise.
   But some analysts say the biggest contribution of the
Arab-Islamic force is is symbolic: Arabs are standing up to Saddam,
muting criticism of having Western forces in a land that houses
Islam's holiest shrines.
   The Arab alliance is ``a useful show of political solidarity,''
said Ian Kemp, a military analyst with Jane's Defense Weekly.
   ``But if it comes to an offensive operation, I don't think
they'll play anything but a marginal role. The Americans and the
British will play the lead.''
   Some expect a force of Kuwaitis and Saudis to spearhead the
U.S.-British effort as a political gesture.
   ``This will allow the Arab-Islamic forces to say they were the
ones who liberated Kuwait City,'' said Tony Banks, political editor
for Jane's.
   ``But when it comes to the real thing, the Americans and the
British will bear the brunt of it.''
   By agreement, no offensive can be launched from Saudi soil
without the consent of King Fahd and President Bush.
   In the defensive configuration, Prince Khalid shares command of
the 28-nation force with U.S. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf.
   ``If there's any blood shed, I can assure you Saudi forces will
be the first to spill it,'' the Saudi prince stressed recently.
``If anyone touches my land, you will see vicious soldiers who will
do their job well.''
   The Saudi army, untested in combat, lives well. Television
antennas sprout from their tents, rugs cover the sand and wool
blankets adorn their bunks.
   Egyptian commandos, in contrast, eat raw rats to prove they can
live in the desert. Syrians drill with Soviet-made T-60 tanks.
   U.S. Special Forces train with many of the Arab forces. They
teach techniques such as mine-clearing, setting up fire zones and
calling in air strikes.
   Among the Arab forces are the remnants of Kuwait's shattered
army. They work with their salvaged tanks and practice karate - a
dubious asset against Iraqi armor and chemical weapons.
   They call themselves the Martyr Brigade, and they talk tough.
   ``We ask to be in the front. We must have revenge,'' said a tank
commander who gave his name only as Ali because his family is still
in Kuwait.
   ``By dying, I'll feel I'm doing something.''

   A trolley car was struck by another trolley this
morning as it unloaded commuters in a station on the edge of Boston
Common, injuring 31 people, at least one critically, officials
said.
   ``I just screamed out, `Everybody hang on and get down! We're
going to hit!''' said Steve DePaulo, a passenger on the moving
train. ``It just seemed like seconds later we smashed into the
trolley in front of us. People just went flying everywhere.'' He
said he thought his train was moving rather fast as it entered the
station.
   The collision between two outbound Green Line trains occurred at
around 6:45 a.m. at underground Arlington Station. The Green Line
is one of four subway lines operated by Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority.
   The accident came less than 2{ weeks after more than 250 people
were injured at nearby Back Bay station when an Amtrak train struck
a commuter train. It also occurred about 2{ hours before a New York
City subway fire killed a passenger and injured at least 100 from
smoke inhalation.
   John Fasana of Emergency Medical Services put the number of
injured in the Boston accident at least 31, describing the injuries
as ``typical injuries expected from a low-impact collision.''
   ``Two of them suffered what I would consider to be serious
injuries,'' he said. ``The rest of them were walking wounded-type
injuries.''
   Ernest Jones, a passenger on the stationary trolley, said one
minute he was reading his newspaper, the next they were hit and he
saw at least four people bleeding from head injuries.
   ``I was looking at the lady across from me. Next thing I knew
the lights went out and she was on the floor,'' he said. ``I saw
one man in the back on the floor on his back, crying, obviously in
agony, hurt.''
   Transit authority officials said each of the one-car trains was
carrying about 40 people, with the capacity for 60. They said
ridership was light because of the holidays this week. After the
accident, riders were bused between stations on each side of the
accident site.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis made the Green Line well-known during
the 1988 presidential campaign because he commuted on the line from
his home in Brookline to the Massachusetts Statehouse.
   At the time of the accident, the area was experiencing its first
snowstorm of the season, but officials said they doubted that
weather played a role in the underground collision.
   ``That will be part of the investigation, but it does not appear
to be weather related,'' said Nancy Sterling Gleason, a transit
authority spokeswoman.
   Many of the injured were carried from the station on stretchers.
   One person was admitted and listed in critical condition at the
New England Medical Center, said Cheryl Paris, a hospital
spokeswoman. Other hospitals had not determined whether any of the
injured they were treating would have to be admitted.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn, who was on the scene shortly after the
collision, said he wasn't ready to believe reports of another rail
crash so soon after the Back Bay collision, which remains under
investigation.
   ``You think it's just some sort of joke at first, that there was
another train accident,'' Flynn said. ``But we arrived here and saw
the situation.''
   Thomas Glynn, transit authority general manager, said despite
the fact that there have been two rail crashes in less than three
weeks, ``I think in the end people are going to realize that
overall our record is good.''
   Glynn said operators of both trains were sent for drug and
alcohol tests.

   One of the biggest calls Lois Decatur
ever got came this week, but she wasn't there to get it.
   It was talk-show host David Letterman, hoping to chat about the
weather.
   ``He's the most important person ever to call me, and I wasn't
home, gosh darn it,'' Decatur said Thursday. ``I should have stayed
home.''
   Letterman picked her number at random from a telephone directory
while taping his NBC-TV ``Late Night'' show Wednesday night.
   Decatur, 61, said she was driving her son to a bingo game.
   Letterman tried six other numbers around the country. They
weren't home either.
   ``How many people are living in this country, 250 million?''
Letterman asked on the show. ``You'd think we could get one at
home.'' He finally called the mother of a ``Late Night'' employee.
   Decatur said her phone rang a lot the next day - callers who'd
seen her miss her chance in the limelight on national TV.
   Her son didn't win any bingo games either.

   Joylean Lucas did her bit for Operation
Desert Shield, donating coffee and cornbread to the Mississippi
National Guard helicopter crew that landed in her back yard.
   But her first reaction was to call the sheriff's office. After
all, as Mrs. Lucas observed Thursday, ``It's not every day that a
helicopter sits down in your backyard.''
   The whapwhapwhap of a helicopter's rotor can be startling at
close range. Mrs. Lucas heard it while she was taking down her
Christmas decorations.
   ``It sounded like they were going to take the top of the house
down. I guessed I had better see what was going on,'' she said. ``I
ran outside, and I saw the helicopter landing behind the catfish
pond.
   ``At first, it looked like he was going to land in it.''
   The helicopter turned out to be from the Mississippi National
Guard's 155th Armored Brigade, forced to the ground by fog on the
way from Camp Shelby, Miss., to Fort Hood, Texas. Five other
helicopters landed at nearby Buckeye Elementary School.
   Once the chopper set down, Mrs. Lucas recalled, ``two men got
out of the helicopter and said, `We're kind of in a bind.' The
pilot said he was flying along with the others when he couldn't see
anything and spotted our pasture. There was plenty of open field
and pasture for him to land.''
   Mrs. Lucas invited the men inside for coffee, and offered them
some of the lima beans, rice and cornbread she had cooked for
dinner.
   ``All they wanted was some cornbread because they said it
smelled so good,'' she said.
   The 155th Armored Brigade is one of three National Guard combat
brigades in the country activated as part of Operation Desert
Shield. It will train at Fort Hood.

<HEAD>Iraq Preparing Commando Suicide Squads, Analysts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Iraqis are being trained to
conduct attacks against U.S.-led forces if war breaks out, and
Asian military analysts said Friday some were being prepared for
possible suicide missions.
   In another defense move, Iraqi media reported Friday that
paramilitary militias in the Kurdish region have been reactivated
to shore up the country's northern border with Turkey.
   The Asian military analysts, speaking in Baghdad on condition of
anonymity, said Iraq has been training army commandos and
volunteers from the Popular Army for special operations against the
400,000-strong allied forces in Saudi Arabia.
   The analysts said the training includes preparations for
possible sea and airborne missions that they characterized as
suicidal.
   A day earlier, a senior Iraqi Baath Party official was quoted as
saying that thousands of volunteers had completed courses at a
military camp in Najaf, Iraq. He said they receieved special
training on weapons and commando tactics.
   Abdul-rahim Abdul-qadder told Iraq's government-run
Al-Jouhouriya newspaper that since the Persian Gulf crisis began in
August, 138,700 volunteers have been trained in special operations
at the camp, 90 miles south of Baghdad.
   ``The Najaf camp is ideal in training combatants who symbolize
heroism and discipline,'' he told the newspaper.
   The Asian analysts said the volunteers were probably receiving
training in commando missions to be launched behind the lines of
the multinational forces.
   More than half of Iraq's 1 million-strong army is deployed in
southern part of the country and in Kuwait. The U.N. Security
Council has said Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face
possible attack by U.S.-led forces.
   The Popular Army was set up by the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party as an ideological counterweight to the Iraqi army. Officials
in Baghdad say it numbers 8 million, but diplomatic sources place
its strength at closer to 850,000 and say the soliders are mostly
poor combatants.
   Meanwhile, Iraqi Interior Minister Samir Mouhamad Abdul-wahab
urged local chieftans in the Kurdish region to take part in ``plans
to confront the challenges imposed on Iraq,'' news reports from
Baghdad said Friday.
   The chieftains were appointed as commanders of the
pro-government paramilitary forces formed during the 1980-88 war
with Iran to combat the Kurdish rebellion in northern Iraq.
   The units, known as National Defense Brigades, were defunct
after the cease-fire went into effect in the Iran-Iraq war and the
government had crushed the Kurdish rebellion.
   The analysts said the reactivation of the militia of about
300,000 men was intended to beef up Iraq's defenses against Turkey,
Iraq's northern neighbor.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week accused Turkey of
deploying troops and warplanes on the border and said Iraq had to
increase its military strength in the area to counter the buildup.

<HEAD>Eighth-Graders Sell Script to Steven Spielberg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNESBORO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three eighth-graders who created a script
for an afternoon children's show about a vacation gone wrong will
travel to Los Angeles next month to sign a contract with Steven
Spielberg.
   Renee Carter, Amy Crosby and Sarah Creek created an illustrated
200-page story book for an episode of the show, ``Tiny Toon
Adventures.'' It is produced by Spielberg, whose movies include
``Jaws,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' and ``E.T.''
   ``It was a miracle our idea was ever accepted,'' said Miss
Crosby. ``They told us the studio usually returns unsolicited
material without even opening it.''
   Studio officials said someone at Warner Bros. which syndicates
the show, mistakenly opened the manuscript package, liked it, and
passed it on. The manuscript passed from desk to important desk,
impressing all readers, until it arrived in front of Spielberg.
   He liked what he saw.
   Warner Bros. lawyers were said to have advised against pursuing
the script. They said it would create a precedent and that the
studio would be swamped with scripts from school children.
   ``But Steven wanted it, and you don't say no to Steven
Spielberg,'' said Jean MacCurdy, vice president and general manager
of Warner Bros. Animation.
   Spielberg sent Ms. MacCurdy and Barbara Brogliatti, senior vice
president of publicity and promotion, to Waynesboro on Dec. 13 to
meet with the students and make an offer.
   ``They proposed paying us $250 for the episode, which we will
split three ways, and to fly us and our parents to Los Angeles for
four days,'' Miss Carter said.
   The girls and their parents leave Jan. 18 for Los Angeles. While
there, they will tour Universal Studios, Magic Mountain, Warner
Bros. Studios, and attend a news conference and story meeting with
Spielberg.
   Miss Carter said the idea for the story book, a series of
drawings and captions detailing the action of an episode, came to
her at school one day. She began drawing characters and laying out
a story line. The story eventually was titled ``Buster and Babs Go
Hawaiian.''
   The characters Buster and Babs take a free Hawaiian vacation,
which turns out to be a nightmare of lost luggage, inoperable
rental cars, bad hotels and a cruise that ends up in a shipwreck.
   The two other girls contributed story ideas and artwork. The
episode is expected to air next fall on ``Tiny Toons Adventures,''
which is seen on the Fox network.
   Classmates of the girls are already asking them to get
Spielberg's autograph.
   ``Sure,'' said Miss Carter. ``On the contract.''

   An electrical fire spread choking smoke through
a subway tunnel today, killing a commuter and injuring more than
140, officials said. Terrified passengers screamed and prayed out
loud.
   Transit Authority spokeswoman Caren Gardner said the death
occurred after a weather-related fire broke out on the electrified
third rail in the subway tunnel underneath downtown Brooklyn.
   ``We really thought we were gone, that we wouldn't see New
Year's,'' said Gertrude Hoyte, a 51-year-old Brooklyn resident who
was on her way to work in Manhattan.
   She described how smoke filled the subway cars, causing people
to panic and several to vomit into their newspapers.
   ``People were screaming, `We're going to die!''' said passenger
Dana Sullivan, 28, of West Islip. Others were praying out loud, she
said.
   The accident occurred about 9:10 a.m. in the tunnel used by the
No. 2 and No. 3 subway lines, going through downtown Brooklyn and
then under the East River toward Manhattan.
   Authorities said 145 people were injured, all apparently from
smoke inhalation. So many were taken to hospitals - 132 in all -
that city buses had to be used.
   The identity of the dead man, described as a subway rider, was
not released.
   Medical staff at Long Island College Hospital managed to revive
a woman whom authorities at the scene had believed to be dead, but
her condition remained grave, hospital officials said.
   ``The prognosis does not look favorable for her,'' Dr. Neil
Flomenbaum, chairman of emergency medicine at the hospital, said
this afternoon.
   It was one of two serious transit accidents this morning. In
Boston, more than 30 people were injured when a trolley car slammed
into the rear of a stopped car in an underground station near
Boston Common.
   Authorities in New York estimated that there were 300 to 400
people aboard the train most severely affected by the smoke.
   Naomi Smalls-Watson, 23, of Brooklyn said she was sitting in the
first car of the train when she ``heard a popping noise and then a
whoosh.''
   ``Then there was another big boom and people started
panicking,'' she said.
   At that point, the subway tunnel began filling with smoke, so
much that passengers could not see anything outside the train, she
said.
   ``A lot of people passed out,'' she said.
   Witnesses said some passengers considered trying to open train
doors but were convinced by fellow passengers that it would only
worsen the smoke. Eventually, the train was backed up to a station
that was farther away from the fire and the passengers were able to
leave the train.
   The fire on the third rail apparently occurred when snow from
streets above leaked into the subway system and onto wires on the
tracks near the Clark Street station, the last station in Brooklyn
before the train goes under the river, Gardner said. She said it's
possible the snow grounded some heavy-duty electrical cables
against the third rail.
   Some 30 firefighting units responded in Manhattan and Brooklyn,
said department spokesman Joe McGee. He said the smoke condition
was heavier on the Brooklyn side.
   By late morning, dozens of people were being treated or
comforted in the lobbies of downtown Brooklyn buildings. Some
passengers sat wearily in the lobby of a Crosslands Bank as
employees gave them cups of water; others received oxygen from
emergency personnel.

   A convicted cocaine dealer cheated
undercover police in a drug deal, and ended up with a lighter
prison sentence.
   Ramon Leon of Grand Rapids would have faced a mandatory 20 years
in prison if he sold 8 ounces of cocaine to the police. But the
officers later discovered they bought only 7.8 ounces.
   Leon, 28, was sentenced Thursday to 13 to 20 years.
   ``He shorted us,'' Kent County Assistant Prosecutor Ellwyn
Bloemers said. ``That's not unusual to have that happen to us. When
we buy 2 ounces, it should be 56 grams, but we come back with 49
frequently. He's very slick; he's very polished.''
   Bloemers said that on Nov. 22, 1989, an officer weighed the
eight cocaine-filled bags on a scale kept in his car's trunk but
may not have accounted for the weight of the bags. Police paid
$6,800 for the drugs.
   Bloemers said he believes Leon intentionally held back, knowing
an 8-ounce deal could mean a 20-year term.
   State law says a dealer convicted of selling 225 grams or more
of cocaine faces at least 20 years in prison. Dealers convicted of
selling 50 to 224 grams face at least 10 years.
   ``The only reason you're not covered by the 20-year minimum term
is that you cheated the officer in that transaction,'' Circuit
Judge Donald Johnston told Leon before sentencing.

   Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged
9.68 percent this week, up from 9.64 percent last week, according
to a national survey released Friday by the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.
   Two weeks ago, fixed-rate mortgages hit a 44-month low of 9.56
percent after peaking for 1990 at 10.67 percent during the week
ending May 4.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 7.92 percent, up from 7.86 percent last
week, the lowest in 29 months. The one-year rate hit its high for
the year of 8.63 percent in the week ending May 11.
   The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

   The state broadcasting committee has canceled two
episodes of one of the Soviet Union's most popular television
programs because it disapproves of its political coverage, the
show's host said Friday.
   The episodes of ``Vzglyad,'' English for viewpoint, were to
include stories about outgoing Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, including a March interview in which he said he
considered quitting to protest shootings by Soviet troops in his
native Georgia, said the host, Alexander Lyubimov.
   Shevardnadze resigned on Dec. 21, saying he feared hard-line
Communist force were pushing the Soviet leadership into a
dictatorship.
   Program officials said the cancellation was clearly politically
motivated and that it indicated a return to state censorship.
   The episodes were to have been broadcast Friday night and Jan.
4. on Soviet TV's main channel, said Lyubimov, who is also a
lawmaker in the Russian republic's legislature.
   He said that Gostelradio, the state committee for television and
radio, ``told us they don't like political issues'' broadcast on
Channel 1 and said the programs should be withheld ``until ... the
situation is more clear.''
   He said Gostelradio's new chairman, lawmaker Leonid Kravchenko,
told him that Channel 1 ``should be a presidential channel, serving
the president and his policies, his politics.''
   Andrei Shipilov, head of the youth office at Central Television,
said the episodes were canceled ``for political reasons.''
   But Lyubimov said ``Vzglyad'' could not ignore Shevardnadze's
resignation and warning or the Congress of People's Deputies' vote
to strengthen President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's powers.
   He said that when the weekly live news and entertainment program
began in 1987 ``it was one of the first that broke the barriers of
censorship on Soviet TV.''
   ``We are worried about the coincidence between this event and
the recent resignations of supporters of the liberal cause on
Gorbachev's team and the dramatic events at the Congress of
People's Deputies,'' he said.
   ``So far, Gorbachev's team comprises old players and we can
hardly express even cautious optimism in regard to our future. ...
I think that this (cancellation) is another piece of Gorbachev
taking over.''
   Lyubimov said Friday night's program was scheduled to include
interviews with Shevardnadze's aides discussing his resignation.
   Vice President Gennady I. Yanayev, a long time Communist Party
bureaucrat whose confirmation by the legislature Thursday dismayed
leading reformers, had also been invited to appear, he said.
   The Jan. 4 broadcast was to include a 75-minute documentary on
Shevardnadze, videotaped by a crew who accompanied the foreign
minister on an eight-nation African tour in March, Lyubimov said.
   The documentary included a ``very frank'' interview in which
Shevardnadze said he considered resigning over the bloody April
1989 clash in Tblisi, Georgia. Soviet troops shot and killed 19
pro-independence demonstrators.
   The weekly ``Vzglyad'' program includes a game show, a
historical section, and American rock music in addition to the news
segment. Lyubimov said the other segments would be broadcast as
usual.
   Earlier this year, the Sunday night news program ``Seven Days''
was canceled after its popular host made remarks critical of the
government.
   Two weeks ago, ``Authors' Television,'' a group of late night
news and commentary programs, was also pulled off the air, although
it has not formally been canceled.
   Kravchenko, former director-general of the official Tass news
agency, was appointed head of Gostelradio last month as part of a
shakeup of the state television monopoly.
   The reorganization replaced the one Central Television Station
with four separate channels. Each was supposed to have creative and
commercial independence.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said at the time Channel 1
would continue to carry the country's principal news programs and
remain an outlet for government information and cultural
programming.
   Earlier this year, the Supreme Soviet passed a new law on
freedom of the press, giving legal backbone to Gorbachev's policy
of glasnost, or greater openness. It also ended censorship except
on matters of state security.

   Norfolk's two daily newspapers, The
Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star, announced plans Friday to
merge next year into a single, all-day newspaper under The
Virginian-Pilot name.
   The newspapers will be combined in September. Subscribers to The
Ledger-Star, an afternoon newspaper, will begin receiving afternoon
editions of The Virginian-Pilot, which has been published in the
morning.
   ``We will have the same number editions as we do now - four in
the morning and one in the afternoon,'' said Frank Batten Jr., vice
president and associate publisher of the newspapers.
   ``At present, the same reporters write for both newspapers, and
many of the stories appear in both newspapers. Having one name on
the masthead recognizes that The Virginian-Pilot and The
Ledger-Star are almost the same newspaper today.''
   The newspapers, owned by Landmark Communications Inc., combined
their staffs in 1982.
   ``The change to one name will make it easier for people to
understand what we are,'' Batten said.
   The weekday circulation of the morning newspaper paper is
157,292, and 72,066 for the afternoon paper. On Saturday and Sunday
the newspapers publish a combined edition with 239,457 circulation
on Saturday and 239,189 on Sunday.

   Recent storms through the Pacific Northwest are
easing four years of drought in Washington and Oregon.
   The snowy, cold weather that barreled into the western United
States a week before Christmas has built up a substantial snow base
in the Cascade Mountains that could fill reservoirs when it melts
this spring, agriculture officials said.
   ``The Yakima River basin was just barely getting by on
irrigation water in the past few years,'' said William Weller, a
Spokane-based water supply specialist for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. ``It appears this year they will be in real good
shape.''
   But the weather has done little to alleviate California's
equally long drought.
   ``Mostly, we had frost,'' said Emil Loe with the marketing
division of the California Department of Food and Agriculture. ``If
it did anything, it made things worse, because frost dries
everything out a lot. There really was no measurable impact on the
drought from last week's weather here.''
   Temperatures plunging into the teens and 20s have wiped out 80
percent of California's navel orange crop for a loss of nearly $288
million in farming revenues, the department reported. Navel oranges
make up about half of the state's total orange crop.
   Valencia oranges may also be affected, but agricultural
officials will not know the extent of damage until harvesting
begins in March.
   ``People in the industry say they've never seen anything like
this,'' said Tom McNair, agricultural statistician for the
California Agricultural Statistics Service. ``In future years
freezes will be compared to this one. They will say, `It's not as
bad as 1990.'''
   The state avocado producers report a loss of 20 percent of their
crop. And in Imperial County on the Mexico border, cold weather
will leave the lettuce, celery, broccoli and cauliflower crops a
little brown around the edges, but edible, agricultural officials
said.
   The melting snow has helped restock the Northwest's
much-depleted water supply, but Barry Norris, engineer for the
Oregon Water Resources Department, said the state has yet to
recover fully from its dry spell.
   ``We need a good wet January and February, too,'' Norris said.
``We need a couple of better than average years to fill the
reservoirs, get the soil moisture back in good shape and get our
river levels back up. We've gone through a dry cycle.''
   In Washington state, things started to improve in November as
days of rain pushed more than a dozen rivers past flood stage and
forced thousands to flee their homes.
   The winter precipitation is welcome as long as it stays in the
highlands, agricultural officials said.
   ``It's good news if we can get it to stay up there in the
mountains and melt off slowly for summer use,'' Weller said. ``But
it was bad news for western Washington when we had warm rains come
on snow and it melted into floods in November.''

<HEAD>Town Reaches Solution on Pigeon Waste, Some Still Unhappy</HEAD>

   The great pigeon dropping debate here has
been resolved with a decision to pay $67,000 to remove the
offending detritus from town buildings, a solution that an opponent
says is for the birds.
   ``I think it's crazy,'' said David Keenan, who showed up for one
of the many meetings on the subject attired in a ``Pigeon-Buster''
mock space suit.
   Removal of the waste from Town Hall and a school stirred
passionate debate, with Keenan's faction decrying the prospect of
spending town money to do a job they said could be handled by
volunteers.
   T-shirts were printed up with silhouettes of the ubiquitous
pigeons surrounded by the familiar red circle with a diagonal slash
drawn through it.
   The town had set aside $125,000 for the job, but officials
received bids lower than that. The lowest bid failed to meet state
specifications, so the $66,836 contract is going to the
second-lowest bidder, Venture Asbestos Abatement of Salem, N.H.,
according to Laurie Benoit, administratative assistant to the town
manager.
   ``Everything is in place and we should have a signed contract by
the end of next week,'' she said Friday.
   ``It's been a good process. There's been a lot of public input
and it's been a good learning experience.''
   But Keenan, a real estate agent, contractor and candidate for
position of selectman, was less sanguine.
   He noted that Amherst, a small town that mixes Yankee heritage
with the intellectual circles from two private colleges and the
state university, is holding a special meeting to debate a
resolution urging Bush not to go to war in the Persian Gulf.
   ``That's Amherst,'' said Keenan, one of the few Republicans in
town. ``It can't clean up its own pigeon poop but we're going to
have a special Town Meeting to tell Congress what to do.''
   The town of about 34,000 has voted to oppose every war since
1812 and suggested banning the nuclear bomb during the Cold War. It
voted to declare the town a nuclear-free zone and to ban officials
from investing town funds in companies doing business in South
Africa or companies that make nuclear weapons.
   In the pigeon debate, Benoit said the volunteer approach
suggested by Keenan and fellow businessmen was impractical because
it raised too many insurance and liability problems and ran afoul
of state bidding laws.
   ``There was no way. We tried,'' she said.
   Keenan said he still believes in the volunteer approach.
   ``We would rather do things like that than keep raising our
taxes,'' he said.

   Spurred by Iraqi aggression, Persian Gulf
Arab leaders say they're ready to forge a new regional security
structure with Iran, a country that they feared for years.
   But some observers are skeptical that Iran and its neighbors
will ever overcome mutual suspicions and engage in meaningful
cooperation to defend the oil-rich region.
   The Gulf Cooperation Council - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait - was formed in 1981
primarily to counter the threat posed by Iran's Islamic revolution
and its stated aim of toppling the conservative Gulf monarchies.
   But Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani began a process of
rapprochement with the gulf states following the death of Iran's
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in June 1989.
   Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait accelerated that
process. Rafsanjani's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, has
been courting Iran's jittery neighbors since then.
   Saddam's actions proved how vulnerable the gulf states were and
underlined their dependence on the Americans, despite massive
spending on high-tech weaponry.
   The leaders of the GCC states made clear during a four-day
summit in Doha that ended last Tuesday that they now believe Iran
has to be part of long-term defense arrangements in the strategic
region.
   A summit communique expressed interest in developing ``special
relations'' with Tehran and urged it to settle differences with GCC
states ``seriously and realistically.''
   Kuwait's minister of state for foreign affairs, Sheik Nasser
Mohammed al-Sabah, stressed during a recent visit to Tehran:
``Without the powerful presence of Iran, no regional security is
possible or practical.''
   Sheik Nasser's statement reflected how the political map of the
region has been turned upside down by the invasion of Kuwait,
producing alignments that only a couple of years ago would have
been unthinkable.
   Iranian-backed terrorists for years waged a bombing campaign in
Kuwait and tried to assassinate the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, in 1985.
   The Iranians plotted in 1981 to topple Bahrain's ruling family.
Saudi Arabia was a target for Iranian subversion where it hurt
most, the annual Hajj to Mecca. Riyadh severed relations with
Tehran in April 1988.
   Most of the GCC states sided with Iraq during the 1980-88 war
with Iran. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia gave an estimated 34 billion
dollars to Baghdad. Iran attacked their ships in retaliation.
   Since the 1988 cease-fire, Rafsanjani has tried to end Iran's
isolation and rebuild bridges with his neighbors.
   The indications are that Saudi Arabia and Iran could soon
restore relations, a necessary step before the two biggest gulf
states can join forces in a new security structure.
   That's unlikely to happen until Kuwait has been liberated and
Saddam humbled.
   There will be other obstacles to overcome.
   Iran is likely to demand a pre-eminent position in any alliance
that emerges, something the gulf Arabs are not expected to accept
without argument.
   Diplomats said Iran stands to gain the most from an alliance and
cautioned that Tehran was not expected to abandon its aim of
regional domination.
   Iran has opposed the invasion of Kuwait, but it has also
condemned the Western military force brought into the gulf by the
Saudis.
   The Americans say they want to see a new security structure in
the region, which sits on two-thirds of the world's oil reserves.
   Saudi and other Arab officials say that will involve sizeable
U.S. forces staying on for some time, a factor likely to antagonize
the Iranians and other Moslem fundamentalists.
   Iran's radicals oppose any rapprochement with Saudi Arabia.
Rafsanjani has largely outflanked them in a post-Khomeini power
struggle, but they remain a thorn in his side.
   Tehran's radical Kayhan daily on Friday dismissed a regional
defense accord as ``a mirage'' and warned that Iran would be ``the
only loser.''

<HEAD>Government Wants ``Disneyland,'' But Residents Unamused</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DAMDAMA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pehlad Singh, a farmer in this small
village in northern India, is fighting a battle - against an
amusement park.
   Seven centuries ago, Singh's ancestors fought the Moslem Emperor
Balban when he tried - and eventually succeeded - to take over
their area.
   Now, Singh and his fellow villagers want to stop roller coasters
and lagoons from being built on their ancestral lands.
   They say the park, which is popularly called ``Disneyland'' but
has no connection with the real one in California, will destroy
their source of livelihood and ruin their culture.
   ``The government wants to take our land and drive us out,''
Singh said. ``We have warned them that rivers of blood will flow if
they touch our land.''
   The confrontation began early this year when the government of
the northern state of Haryana announced plans to build India's
first big amusement park on 28,000 acres of land inhabited and
farmed by 150,000 people in 28 villages. The government said the
park would cost an estimated $555 million.
   But the villagers, mostly small farmers and cattle grazers, said
the government was trying to uproot them.
   Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, Haryana's highest elected
official, pushed the project through despite the people's
resistance.
   Even before ``Disneyland,'' Chautala's name was synonymous with
dynastic rule and corruption for many people.
   Villagers accused Chautala of using the amusement park to push
up land prices. They said Chautala and his friends had bought a lot
of the surrounding land, which would appreciate enormously once the
amusement park was built.
   Haryana's tourism minister, Siri Krishan Hooda, dismissed ``all
these allegations'' as ``baseless.''
   The people's fears were aggravated further last month when
Chautala's father, Devi Lal, became India's deputy prime minister
and tourism minister.
   Chautala succeeded his father as Haryana's chief minister last
winter but was forced out of office by political infighting at the
national level and the killings of at least 12 people when he ran
for the state legislature. But his father retains the political
clout to expedite the ``Disneyland'' project.
   In December, Devi Lal met the villagers and told them he would
give the go-ahed for the project. Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar,
who accompanied Devi Lal, said he supported the project and wanted
to see it through.
   ``This is all nonsense,'' said Khem Chand, a 60-year-old retired
soldier who lives in one of the villages that would be supplanted
by the amusement park. ``Instead of providing us education and
basic health care, the government is offering us amusement.''
   Like many towns, none of the 28 villages in this area, 25 miles
southwest of New Delhi has sufficient drinking water. The nearest
hospital is several miles away and is usually filled to capacity.
   ``The government is legally right but morally wrong,'' said
Amrit Singh, a village headman, ``They say they have no money to
spare for village development but have enough for this useless
project.''
   Singh's lament - and that of many others - strikes at the heart
of India's most pressing problem: how to develop an overpopulated
country of 880 million plagued by illiteracy and poverty without
alienating the people.
   ``The amusement park is not a need of the people,'' said Prem
Chowdhry, a historian and a native of Haryana. ``It's an example of
development that leaves people out.''
   The Haryana government doesn't agree. It says it will pay the
villagers $5,555 an acre for their land and will employ them in the
amusement park.
   But the money offered by the government is several times lower
than the market price. India has a huge black market economy that
pushes up the price of land enormously. If the villagers sold their
land to businessmen, they could get between $27,777 and $55,555 an
acre.
   But the state government has frozen all land sales in the
villages.
   The villagers are also wary of the government's guarantee of
employment. They say the government seldom employs local people in
tourist resorts. Two years ago the government held out a similar
promise when it built a motel in Damdama. It hired four villagers,
but fired them within a week.
   Many villagers say they will not be able to put the money the
government gives them to good use.
   ``We have been farmers for generations and have never handled
large sums of money,'' said Dhoom Mahase, a 42-year-old farmer.
``Too much money will only destroy us.''

<HEAD>Lithuania Drops Demand for Protocol, Calls for Renewed Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's secessionist parliament agreed Friday
to drop conditions on negotiations with the Kremlin over Lithuanian
independence and called for a new round of talks, the Baltic
government said.
   The vote by the Lithuanian Supreme Council was intended to
restart talks with Soviet officials that were bogged down over
Lithuania's demand for signing of a ``protocol on the starting,
goals and conditions'' of negotiations.
   Soviet officials had refused during preliminary talks to sign
the protocol, insisting the preliminary talks themselves
represented negotiations.
   The sides agreed last June to start negotiations after Soviet
officials said they would lift an economic embargo if Lithuania
suspended its March declaration of independence for 100 days.
   Counting toward the deadline would begin with the start of
negotiations.
   The parliament voted Friday ``to allow the state delegation ...
to begin negotiations with the U.S.S.R. without a previously
determined negotiations commencement protocol, but without
violating the sovereignty of the Lithuania state,'' according to
Lithuanian statement sent by telex.
   Lithuania President Vytautas Landsbergis, in a speech to the
parliament, said he was ready ``to soften the demand for a ...
protocol whose signing the Lithuanian side had considered necessary
for the start of negotiations,'' the pro-Lithuanian news agency
Baltfax reported.
   The statement gave no date for the start of talks. There was no
immediate reaction from the Kremlin.
   During the preliminary talks in Moscow last fall, the Soviet
delegation was led by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who
suffered a heart attack last week. It was unclear who would lead
the Soviet side in his place.

   Watch your language. Some 10,000 academics -
representing a veritable ``Who's Who'' of English and language
professors - were in town Friday.
   The president of the Modern Language Association says the
group's annual convention is bent on exploring ``the newest of
methods and the oldest of texts.''
   ``I think this association really represents a great commitment
to diversity of inquiry and freedom of thought,'' said Catharine
Stimpson, president of the 32,000-member organization.
   Stimpson said much debate in academic circles today focuses on
the trend on college campuses to teach and review literature beyond
the traditional scope of Western Civilization. New perspectives
include those of minority, feminist, Third-World and homosexual
authors.
   The trend has been criticized for forcing students into
``politically correct'' interpretations of written works and moving
away from the study of classics.
   But the purpose of studying literature is to learn about
cultural values and that study shouldn't be limited to old methods
and established texts, said Stimpson, an English professor at
Rutgers University in New Jersey.
   ``There are lots of different perspectives. Some are richer than
others and some are more comprehensive than others,'' Stimpson
said. ``Historically you can look back at literature to see the way
it's shaped culture's ideas of what is beautiful, what is true.''
   Many professors and graduate students welcomed the move toward
exploring more diverse literature. Some criticized more traditional
presentations for giving the impression that authors must be white,
male, European and dead to be worth studying.
   ``These newer texts, I think, will show students that literature
is still an open-ended enterprise,'' said Robert Hamner, a
professor at Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas. ``A
writer doesn't have to be dead to deal with serious issues.''
   Hamner, who specializes in Caribbean literature, has been
teaching since 1968. He said while the movement toward diversity
isn't new, it's finally gaining attention.
   ``Some students find it exciting, they're looking for something
new and interesting,'' Hamner said. ``I tell them to remember that
these writers are not being touted because they're minority
artists. They are just good authors.''
   But introducing a more diverse selection of literature isn't
just a matter of choosing the authors and telling students to start
reading, said Susan K. Harris, who teaches at Queens College, City

   ``Philosophically I'm all for it,'' said Harris, who specializes
in American literature and 19th century women authors. ``But on a
practical level I'm still struggling.''
   Harris said professors encounter difficulty drawing critical and
thematic connections between the newer texts and the classics.
   ``I have found ways to talk about the new literature in artistic
terms,'' she said. ``People critical of the new approach often feel
it's all come down to the fact that we've thrown out art in favor
of diversity.''

<HEAD>Greece to Pardon Imprisoned Members of Former Right-Wing
Dictatorship</HEAD>

   The conservative government announced
Friday it intends to pardon nearly all the imprisoned leaders of
the 1967-74 right-wing dictatorship.
   The announcement to free seven of the eight former military
leaders outraged socialists, Communists and other leftists,
thousands of whom were jailed or exiled during the dictatorship.
Many politicians and other citizens were tortured.
   Andreas Papandreou, whose socialist government ruled from 1981
to 1989, denounced the decision as an ``insult to those that fought
and died for democracy in our country.''
   Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis proposed the pardon for
humanitarian reasons after meeting with President Constantine
Caramanlis. Justice Minister Athanassios Kanellopoulos said the
ministry's pardons committee will discuss it Monday, and approval
was expected.
   According to practice, a pardon is proposed by the government
and approved by the committee, clearing the way for a presidential
decree.
   Eight members of the junta are serving prison terms ranging from
20 years to life imprisonment for their involvement in the military
coup. Since their sentencing by a special court in 1975, they have
refused to apply for pardons.
   The only junta member left out of the proposed pardon was
Dimitris Ioannides, who engineered a failed 1974 coup in nearby
Cyprus, a disaster that led to the partition of the Mediterranean
island and Greece's return to civilian rule.
   Those serving life sentences include former Col. George
Papadopoulos, 71, who led the April 1967 army coup in Greece; his
brother Constantine, 69; and Ioannides, 67, a former brigadier who
in turn overthrew Papadopoulos. They were originally sentenced to
death for high treason.
   The rest of those jailed are former military officers convicted
of torture.
   The military took over the government in 1967 following a period
of political instability, and Papadopolous vowed at the time:
``There is no possibility of democracy as practiced in the past
ever returning to Greece.''
   The junta was condemned in the West as clumsy and authoritarian.
Its political opponents were tortured by the military police and
exiled by the thousands to barren Greek islands.
   The United States distanced itself from the junta and
temporarily banned arms sales to Greece, but then-Vice President
Spiro Agnew went to Greece in 1971 in a visit seen a tacit approval
of the regime.
   The junta relinquished power after a student uprising in
November 1973 and Ioannides' failed 1974 coup in Cyprus aimed at
uniting the island with Greece.
   The short-lived coup resulted in Turkey invading the island,
ostensibly to protect the Turkish-Cypriot minority. The July 1974
invasion of Cyprus brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war.
   The military turned over power latr that year to an interim
government led by Caramanlis, which oversaw elections. Caramanlis
also had immediately commuted the death sentences handed down by
the special court.
   Six other members of the junta have been released over the years
for health reasons.
   Papandreou, the main opposition leader, said the government's
decision to pardon the junta members would allow them to claim
their 1967 military coup was justified.
   ``It is a case of justification. They didn't ask for a pardon.
It was imposed on them from above,'' Papandreou said.
   The Communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and Progress said
it considered ``the government decision an insult to the democratic
feelings of the Greek people.''
   Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy returned to power in
April after losing to the Socialists in 1981. The prime minister
said Caramanlis did not have any objections to his decision.

   With tears streaming, they stood on the
piers and watched and waved. Wives and mothers, fathers and
friends, they strained to catch a last glimpse of the gray-hulled
ships whose silhouettes bled into a foggy gray horizon.
   Friday was shipping-out day for 16,000 sailors and Marines. For
the first time since the Vietnam War, two aircraft carriers - the
America and the Theodore Roosevelt - were sent overseas at the same
time from the huge Norfolk Naval Base.
   Six other ships assigned to the carriers' battle groups also
left the Virginia port, and nine other Navy vessels sailed from New
York City and Mayport, Fla.
   They are being sent to the Persian Gulf to augment American
forces in Operation Desert Shield. For those whose loved ones are
aboard the ships, it was a difficult farewell.
   ``I wish men would stop being so greedy,'' a sobbing Michelle
Coats of Virginia Beach said of the crisis that began with Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. Mrs. Coats married seaman Brad Coats
of the destroyer Caron just last weekend and celebrated a combined
Christmas-honeymoon at home.
   A brisk wind, occasional drizzle and temperatures just above
freezing failed to keep hundreds of family members off the piers as
ships pulled away.
   A few people waved American flags; others carried signs with
personal messages, such as ``Love Ya Jim.'' Emotions ran high, and
many people cried and hugged each other as the ships shoved off.
   ``Once he goes out, he'll have a great experience,'' said Vida
Tyndall of Covington, Ga., whose son, Dorian Cheek, is assigned to
the Roosevelt. ``But the threat of war puts a damper on the
excitement.''
   Cheek, a port equipment maintenance specialist, said he was
thrilled at his first deployment but would miss his family. ``Can't
wait to get over and get back,'' he said.
   Joseph Leyes of Millford, Conn., who came with his wife,
Margaret, to watch the departure of their son Louis aboard the
Caron, said he felt ``sad, excited, supportive, frightened.''
   ``They're going to go out there, they're going to do a job,
they're going to come back,'' Leyes said. ``I'm very confident they
know what they're doing.''
   How long the deployment will last is the second big question for
families, after their concerns about a war.
   ``We know it's going to be a long time,'' said 13-year Navy
veteran Gordon Wilson of Norfolk, a Roosevelt crewman who said he
hopes to return in time for his son's 10th birthday next September.
   ``This will be the longest he's ever been away,'' said his wife,
Toni. She said the crisis has given her a keen interest in
following the news.
   ``You cling to every word when you hear something about the
Roosevelt or the Navy or the Persian Gulf,'' Mrs. Wilson said.
   The America and Roosevelt will join three other carriers in the
area: the Kennedy, Saratoga and Ranger.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won victory after
victory at the Congress of People's Deputies session that ended
this week. But he still may have come out a loser.
   The 59-year-old Soviet president gained new constitutional
powers, streamlined the executive branch of government, and pushed
reluctant lawmakers into confirming his nominee for the new job of
vice president.
   But he came no closer to solving the key question of how to hold
the 15 republics together - a problem that burst onto the surface
again Thursday, the final day of the Congress, in an angry rift
with the Russian Federation over the national budget.
   Earlier in the 10-day session, Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze's sudden resignation and dramatic warning that the
country was moving toward dictatorship caused international concern
over the fragility of Gorbachev's democratic reforms.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's heart attack deprived Gorbachev
of a second faithful political ally, at least temporarily.
   And in choosing Communist Party apparatchik Gennady I. Yanayev
as vice president, Gorbachev missed an opportunity to pick a
better-known figure who might have stopped his slide in public
opinion polls.
   ``The more the president surrounds himself with little-known
politicians, the lower his own rating will be,'' reformist lawmaker
and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak told reporters.
   The 2,250-member Congress, which usually meets twice a year, is
the country's highest legislative body and must approve all
constitutional amendments.
   After a carefully orchestrated debate - Chairman Anatoly
Lukyanov shut off the microphones of dissenters and refused to
allow votes on their motions - the lawmakers overwhelmingly
approved Gorbachev's reorganization of the executive branch.
   Gorbachev asked for, and got, a ``vertical line of authority''
from the presidency, through the new Cabinet of Ministers, to
government officials at the regional, city and village level.
   In the past, decisions by the ministries could be overturned by
the Supreme Soviet, the 542-member standing legislature elected by
the Congress. Now, the ministries answer directly to the president.
   The streamlining, coupled with the authority previously granted
to issue presidential decrees, gives Gorbachev strong weapons to
put down ethnic disputes, enforce economic changes and impose other
orders.
   His only defeat was a vote against creating a Supreme State
Inspectorate, a new law enforcement agency to ensure compliance
with his decrees. But a presidential aide said Gorbachev believes
he can still establish the inspectorate - by decree.
   With his dual position as leader of the Communist Party and head
of the restructured government, the only thing now standing between
Gorbachev and authoritarian rule may be his personal commitment to
democracy.
   Fear of that commitment wavering under pressure from hard-liners
appears to have been behind Shevardnadze's warning.
   ``My guess is that what he worried about was not so much a
conscious effort that, `We're going to establish a dictatorship,'
but a slide into the use of authoritarian methods,'' a western
diplomat in Moscow said Friday.
   ``For example, if force is used in some of the republics now,
and that brings a reaction of the people, you could get an
escalating situation, and a growing bloodbath.''
   Short of using force, it is unclear how much obedience Gorbachev
can expect from the republics, no matter what legal authority he
might have.
   That uncertainty was underlined on the final day of the Congress
when the president demanded that lawmakers in Russia, the largest
of the 15 republics, reverse their stance on the national budget.
   Russia's parliament recently asserted control over the lion's
share of taxes and other government revenues raised on its
territory. Gorbachev told the Congress that Russian lawmakers had
voted to cut the republic's contribution to the 1991 national
budget by about 80 percent.
   As though giving a stern lesson to a lazy pupil, Gorbachev
ticked off some major items in the national budget: education,
health care, scientific research, defense and subsidies for heavy
industry.
   ``What are we supposed to do, disband our military entirely and
stop all fundamental science?'' he said.
   Gorbachev said he was now unable to conclude a temporary
agreement to maintain economic ties between the republics pending
the completion of a new Union Treaty, the fundamental document that
formed the country in 1922.
   If other republics follow Russia's suit, he warned, the result
could be ``the collapse not only of the economy, but of the
union.''
   After Gorbachev's impassioned speech, the response from Russian
lawmakers was an unsettling silence.
   The republic's president, Boris N. Yeltsin, was on a trip to the
Yakutsk region of Siberia. Its parliament had recessed for the New
Year's holiday.
   When the Russian lawmakers convene next month, Gorbachev will
face a severe test of his moral and political authority - and his
new constitutional powers are unlikely to be much help.

<TEXT>
   Gilbert Lindsay, the city's first black city
councilman who played an instrumental role in shaping the modern
skyline of Los Angeles, died Friday. He as 90.
   Lindsay, who had served on the council since January 1963, died
at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, said Bill
Chandler, a spokesman for Mayor Tom Bradley. Lindsay had been
hospitalized for four months by a stroke. The cause of death was
cardiac arrest, the mayor's office said.
   ``I am deeply saddened that Gil Lindsay, with whom I shared a
lifelong friendship and more than 27 years of public life, has
died,'' said Bradley.
   Lindsay was born on a Mississippi cotton plantation in 1900. He
served in the Army's 10th Cavalry and the 25th Infantry. After
leaving the military, he moved to Los Angeles and became a janitor
in the city's Department of Water and Power.
   In 1952, Lindsay signed on with county supervisor Kenneth Hahn's
campaign. Hahn, the longest-serving supervisor in state history,
made Lindsay the county's first black deputy supervisor.
   After a decade in that job, Lindsay was appointed to the vacant
9th District seat on the City Council in 1963. In that job,
representing the downtown financial district, Chinatown and Little
Tokyo, he helped push through legislation lifting the city's
12-story building height limit. That prompted a boom in high-rise
development that transformed the city.

<TEXT>
   Supporters of two rival political
parties battled with homemade bombs in a Dhaka suburb Friday,
leaving at least 15 people injured, police said.
   The clash was the first major outbreak of violence between
political parties since the ouster of President Hussein Muhammed
Ershad earlier this month. It erupted when the Awami League and the
Freedom Party held campaign rallies at the same place.
   Police said both sides exploded homemade bombs during the
hourlong melee. They said they used steel-tipped batons to stop the
fighting. Police said three policemen were among the 15 injured.
   The Awami League is led by Sheik Hasina, who was at the
forefront of seven weeks of nationwide protests urging the ouster
of Ershad. Ershad stepped down Dec. 6, turned over power to a
caretaker government and was placed under house arrest.
   The Freedom Party is led by Syed Farukur Raman, a retired army
colonel, who took part in a 1975 coup that ousted Bangladesh's
first independent government headed by Sheik Mujibur Rahman, father
of Mrs. Hasina.
   The caretaker government headed by acting President Shahabuddin
Ahmed has announced parliamentary elections for Feb. 27.
   A Home Ministry press communique warned Friday that the
government will deal sternly with incidents of violence between
political parties.
   ``The government wants all political parties to exercise
restraint for holding peaceful elections,'' the communique said.

   Italy's state-owned television decided Friday not to
air an interview with Saddam Hussein, saying the broadcast might
``disturb the efforts'' for a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The decision to squelch the broadcast indefinitely drew sharp
protest from reporters. The journalist who conducted the interview,
Bruno Vespa, threatened to resign.
   The director-general of RAI television, Gianni Pasquarelli,
announced the move in a letter to Vespa, the highly regarded
director of the nightly TG-1 news broadcast.
   ``Italy is president of the European Community and we must
avoid, in a moment of extreme delicacy, any act that could
contribute to disturb the efforts that are being made to find a
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis,'' said the letter, read on
the evening broadcast.
   It did not say how the interview might have affected peace
efforts.
   Vespa told viewers of Friday night's TG-1 program that he
disagreed with the decision. ``I expressed to the director-general
my surprise and my complete dissent,'' he said.
   A RAI spokesman said he did not know if the Italian government
had asked the network to stop the broadcast. The government funds
RAI and political parties have broad influence in its operation.
   The Iraqi leader has given numerous interviews to Western
television stations since his country invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Vespa said that during the 1-hour, 40-minute interview conducted
several days ago, Saddam had harshly criticized the United States
and seemed to rule out negotiations.
   He added that Saddam had ``implicitly admitted'' he would use
chemical weapons in a war.
   The editorial committee of the RAI said it supported Vespa in
the dispute.
   ``The invitation (by Pasquarelli) to not transmit the interview
appears like an act of self-censorship that the editorial staff of
TG-1 can not consider acceptible in any way,'' the committee said
in a statement.
   Pasquarelli, who belongs to the dominant Christian Democrat
Party, became director-general of RAI earlier this year after
serving as managing director of the state highway corporation. He
was previously a television journalist.
   The Christian Democrats control appointments at RAI-1, the
channel that broadcasts Vespa's program.
   The second-biggest party in the government, the Socialists, have
strong influence at RAI-2, another state-owned channel.
   The Communists, Italy's biggest opposition party, condemned the
decision not to show the interview.
   ``We have denounced for some time the new climate of censorial
secrecy that is predominant at the RAI,'' said Walter Veltroni, the
party's spokesman.

   The lawyer for convicted Nazi war criminal John
Demjanjuk said Friday he has filed a motion to have his client
freed because of new evidence that could prove his innocence.
   The Supreme Court will hear the motion Monday, said Yoram
Sheftel, Demjanjuk's Israeli attorney.
   The court hear Demjanjuk's appeal of his death sentence last
summer, but has not yet issued its final ruling. Demjanjuk, a
retired auto worker, lived in Ohio after the war and was extradited
to Israel for trial in 1986.
   Sheftel said a file discovered in Moscow proves that his client
is not ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a gas-chamber operator at the
Treblinka camp in Nazi-held Poland who raped, beat and stabbed Jews
headed to their deaths.
   The newly discovered file contains ``numerous statements taken
in the 1950s by Ukrainian guards at Treblinka that state clearly
that `Ivan the Terrible' was Ivan Marczenko,'' Sheftel said.
   ``There is no dispute that Demjanjuk was never called Marczenko
and was born under (the name) Demjanjuk,'' Sheftel added.
   The prosecution contends Demjanjuk took the alias Marczenko
because it was his mother's maiden name.
   Sheftel said he discovered the material in Moscow three weeks
ago and that the prosecution had flown to Moscow to investigate it.
   Prosecutor Michael Sheked could not be reached for comment.

   Parliament has decided to investigate
officials who allowed former King Michael to enter Romania on
Christmas Day but then deported him, state media reported Friday.
   Deputies from all parties decided to form a multiparty
commission to investigate and asked a full report from Interior
Minister Doru Viorel Ursu, the official news agency Rompres
reported.
   Opposition parties in the assembly criticized the National
Salvation Front government for deporting Michael hours after
authorities let him into the country.
   Lawmakers from the governing party demanded that airport
authorities and the Interior Ministry be investigated for letting
the 69-year-old Michael in, allegedly without a visa.
   The former monarch was flown back to Swiss exile in a military
plane early Wednesday, less than 12 hours after arriving on his
first visit to Romania since Communists forced him to abdicate in
1947.
   His wife, Anne de Bourbon-Parma, a daughter and accompanying
staff and reporters were also ejected.
   A statement issued by Michael's office in Geneva and carried by
Rompres on Friday said he was in Romania ``on a perfectly legal
basis'' and blamed the ``highest Romanian authorities'' for
expelling him. It said this could not prevent Michael's ``unabated
wish to travel to Romania as a free citizen of this country.''
   The former king ``declares himself ready to serve the cause of
the Romanian people,'' it added.
   But Deputy Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu said Michael could
have been tried for ``fraudulent border crossing'' and would have
faced up to six months in jail, if convicted.

<TEXT>
   North Carolina filed a lawsuit Friday
seeking $5.5 million from the operator of a dredge that broke loose
from moorings and knocked out the only road link to Hatteras
Island.
   North American Trailing Co. was negligent in the Oct. 26
accident because the dredge's captain failed to drop a second
anchor during a storm, the lawsuit said.
   The accident stranded residents and tourists on the island. The
U.S. District Court suit filed in Norfolk, Va. seeks money to
repair a damaged 370-foot section of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge.
   ``We think they were negligent in making their decision to
anchor where they did in light of weather forecasts,'' said Grayson
Kelly, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office.
   ``We think they were negligent in being unable to navigate under
the bridge without striking the bridge, which they were required to
do under contract by the Corps of Engineers,'' he said.
   The U.S. Coast Guard ruled Dec. 18 that the dredge captain,
William Cliett, may have been negligent in not dropping a second
anchor to help keep the craft from slamming into the bridge.
   There was no answer Friday to repeated telephone calls to North
American Trailing's offices.
   The cost of repairing the bridge initially was estimated at
about $3 million, but was raised to $5.5 million, Kelly said. The
amount could go up again, he said.
   In testimony before the Marine Safety Office in Norfolk last
month, Cliett said the vessel was anchored in its usual place
before the accident. He said weather conditions ``well beyond the
conditions which had been forecast'' led to the accident.
   Officials estimated in mid-November that repairs, which are
under way, would take until the end of January to complete. But
many of the island's 5,000 residents said they expected bad winter
weather to prolong repairs.
   The state is spending $20,000 a day on ferry service to Hatteras
Island, another cost the state hopes will be passed to North
American Trailing, Kelly said.
   The Coast Guard said Cliett chose to try to free the vessel
rather than secure it with a second anchor.
   ``Under the circumstances, it would have been prudent to use all
means available and a second anchor may have added sufficient
holding power to prevent the (accident),'' the Coast Guard said in
a statement. ``The master's failure to use the second anchor
constitutes evidence of negligence on his part.''

   Iraq referred to its conquest of Kuwait as
a ``felicitous union'' in a letter circulated Friday objecting to
Kuwait's ambassador being seated in the General Assembly.
   The letter from the Iraqi U.N. Mission, dated Dec. 20 but
released Friday, expresses a reservation to the General Assembly's
credentials committee report in the case of Kuwait.
   Iraq did not try to challenge Kuwait's right to be seated.
   It would have lost any such attempt in the General Assembly by a
humiliating margin. Nearly all the 158 other voting members would
have backed Kuwait's membership.
   Iraq's letter says the ``felicitous union produced by the merger
of Iraq and Kuwait on 9 August 1990 has made Iraq and Kuwait once
again a single state represented by a single delegation to the
United Nations.
   ``Accordingly, the delegation of Iraq enters a reservation with
respect to the decision of the Credentials Committee to accept the
credentials of the so-called delegation of Kuwait to the United
Nations and wishes to have that reservation officially recorded.''
   Baghdad announced Aug. 9 it had annexed Kuwait as Iraq's 19th
province, a week after invading the emirate.
   The Security Council voted 15-0 that same day to declare the
annexation null and void in international law, in Resolution 662.

   Police will step up patrols in
neighborhoods where five students were slain as the University of
Florida's campus begins to fill up after the holiday break, the

   The still unsolved killings happened in August at the beginning

   Five students, four females and a male, were stabbed to death
and mutilated in their off-campus apartments.
   Clifton said confusion caused by students moving in, many not
knowing their neighbors and being careless about security, may have
been a factor in the slayings.
   The second semester starts Jan. 7.
   ``We want to be particulary cautious,'' Clifton said Thursday.
   Undercover and uniformed officers will patrol southwest
Gainesville and other areas heavily populated by students, he said.
Clifton didn't say how many officers will be sent to the
neighborhoods.
   ``We want to saturate the area,'' he said.
   Clifton said a task force of investigators is making progress on
the case and he believes it will be solved.
   The focus has faded from former University of Florida freshman
Edward Lewis Humphrey, for weeks considered a strong suspect. He is
serving a sentence in a mental institution for beating his
grandmother.

<HEAD>Foes Snub Romania's Iliescu, Warn of `New Dictatorship'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prominent members of the original
leadership of Romania's revolution spurned President Ion Iliescu's
invitation to attend a first anniversary celebration of the
uprising Friday and warned of a ``new dictatorship.''
   A spokeswoman at Iliescu's office said the celebration was going
ahead as planned Friday evening, with most of those invited
expected to attend.
   Eight founding members of the National Salvation Front, which
took power during the December 1989 revolution against Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, said they would boycott celebrations at
Iliescu's offices in Bucharest's Cotroceni Palace.
   In a letter, they accused the Front of having used them ``to
lend legitimacy to the appearance of democracy ... as a democratic
ornament for a masked new dictatorship.''
   The group includes popular revolutionary figures such as former
dissidents Doina Cornea and Ana Blandiana, intellectual Gabriel
Andreescu and actor Ion Caramitru.
   ``We are united in the feeling that we were used from the
beginning,'' said the letter, a copy of which was made available to
The Associated Press.
   The Front overwhelmingly won elections last May. But the
government it formed has come under increasing fire from opponents,
who claim many of its leaders are old regime holdovers and still
harbor Communist tendencies.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed on Dec. 25, 1989.
   Last week, Iliescu sent invitations to all 71 members of the
Front's original council, hastily formed by former Communists,
dissidents, prominent intellectuals and others on Dec. 22, 1989,
when Ceausescu fled Bucharest.
   Many members, including the eight boycotters, soon resigned and
later became Iliescu's most vocal critics.
   The letter from the eight said their attendance would have given
the ``illusion of dialogue (with the government) which has proven
impossible over the past year.''
   Sources close to Iliescu, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the invitation was ``an honest attempt at reconciliation at a
difficult time for Romania.''
   Frequent, sometimes violent anti-government street protests have
taken place since the May elections.
   In mid-June, six people were killed when police and
pro-government miners suppressed a 53-day opposition rally in
Bucharest.
   Government economic reforms proposed in November that included
raising prices on many basic goods have also led to popular
protests among consuers.
   On Friday, Finance Minister Teodor Stolojan presented to
Parliament a national budget for 1991 of $7.2 billion, slightly
higher than 1990's budget of $7 billion.
   He said state investments in the economy would decrease from
$1.7 billion this year to $890 million in 1991 and would help slash
a budget deficit that totaled $1 billion this year.
   He said private savings here could help boost the economy.
   ``There is enough money around for investments in the economy,''
Stolojan told Parliament. ``We do not need to allocate large sums
from the budget.''
   He urged quick adoption of new tax and foreign investment laws.
He also said that Romania's currency, the leu, ``is still far from
convertibility.'' The leu was devalued officially in November from
20 to the dollar to 35 to the dollar. Its unofficial value on the
parallel market usually exceeds 120 to the dollar.

<TEXT>
   A woman convicted of inciting violence after
she burned an American flag to protest the military buildup in the
Persian Gulf was sentenced Friday to one year in prison.
   Cheryl Lessin of Cleveland was taken to jail immediately after a
judge imposed the sentence.
   Several of Lessin's supporters chanted ``Stop the U.S. war
machine no matter what it takes'' as they left the Justice Center.
   Her lawyers said they will ask that Lessin be freed pending
appeal.
   A jury in October convicted Lessin, 46, on a charge of inciting
violence after she took part in an Aug. 10 protest against the
presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The rally in downtown Cleveland escalated into scuffling and
yelling after Lessin burned the flag.
   Two police officers testified that she ran through the crowd
throwing punches and shouting obscenities. Lessin and other
witnesses said at the trial that the protest was not a riot.
   Lessin's lawyer, Christopher Stanley, asked the Ohio Supreme
Court to disqualify Common Pleas Judge Patricia Cleary, saying she
was prejudiced, but the high court rejected the request.
   Stanley said Cleary should have instructed the jury that flag
burning is a protected form of free speech. He said prosecutors
used a state law against inciting violence to prosecute Lessin for
burning the flag.
   Clearly said she applied the law correctly during the trial and
in her jury instructions.

<HEAD>Former Secret Police Chief Arrested in Chilean `S&amp;L' Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former secret police chief under the
military regime was arrested Friday for his alleged involvement in
a financial scandal that has shaken the Chilean army.
   Gen. Gustavo Abarzua wa held incommunicado by judge Marcos
Libedinsky, who has five days to either charge or release him, said
Abarzua's lawyer, Marcelo Cibie.
   Two other generals, Patricio Gualda and Patricio Varela, were
briefly detained and questioned by Libedinsky, but were not
charged.
   Libedinsky was appointed two months ago to investigate an
illegal savings and loan scam in which hundreds of soldiers, lured
by interest rates of up to 30 percent, deposited their savings with
army officers.
   The bank, called La Cutufa after the name of a dog reportedly
owned by one of its officers, collapsed when the operators fell
short on payments.
   So far eight officers have been charged with breaking the
banking law.
   News coverage of his investigation has clearly upset former
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who turned over the government to
elected President Patricio Aylwin in March after a 16-year
dictatorship.
   Pinochet put the army on alert for several hours Dec. 19 to
protest the investigation. The government, sensitive to the
military's anger, has tried to keep a lid on the affair.
   But Pinochet did order an internal army investigation of the
bank, and has given Libedinsky a list of 150 officers and
non-commissioned officers who were punished by the military as a
result of the probe. Many were discharged.
   Abarzua was the last chief of the feared military intelligence
agency, known by its Spanish initials CNI, which was disbanded
shortly before Pinochet stepped down.
   Abarzua, Gualda and Varela were retired in October by Pinochet,
who remains commander of the 60,000-man army.

   Opposition parties called for immediate
mass protests Friday to force President Mobutu Sese Seko from
power. They said Mobutu is a dictator who has delayed a promised
transition to democracy.
   It was the first time Mobutu's opponents joined in a common
front.
   Mobuto has ruled this central African state for 25 years. He
pledged in April to install a multiparty democracy within a year,
but modified this later to say he would permit only three political
parties to contest 1991 elections.
   The opposition emanded Friday that Mobutu resign and be
replaced by a government of national unity to organize elections
ending one-party rule.
   The Zairean leader is also under pressure from the United States
and other Western governments.
   U.S. officials previously shrugged off accusations of human
rights abuses in Zaire to support Mobutu as a bulwark against
Marxism in the region. But Congress ignored appeals from the Bush
administration and cut all aid to Mobutu's government following
charges that Zairean troops massacred from 50 to 150 students at
the University of Lubumbashi in a night raid last May 11.
   Mobutu's government said one student was killed in what it first
described as ethnic factional fighting. Later, it blamed regional
government officials for the attack and said they would be
punished.
   The opposition on Friday asked an international inquiry into the
incident. Mobutu refused such a request earlier from Belgium, the
former colony power.
   At least six people were killed this month in demonstrations
against price increases. Government foes say soldiers shot the six.
Officials deny it.
   The opposition parties also complained Friday of economic
hardship and devaluation of Zaire's currency.

<DATELINE>KYLE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of American Indians on horseback
arrived Friday at the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre on the
eve of its centennial.
   Religious ceremonies and other observations were planned for
Saturday at the site of the final bloody chapter in the 19th
century U.S.-Indian wars.
   Fifty riders set out Dec. 15 from Standing Rock Indian
Reservation in north-central South Dakota. Others joined along the
way. About 300 riders arrived at Wounded Knee at the conclusion of
the 220-mile trip.
   The event they are commemorating occurred Dec. 29, 1890, when
U.S. calvary troops killed hundreds of Sioux men, women and
children at Wounded Knee. The exact number is a point of
contention. The federal government says about 150 died; the Sioux
say as many as 400.
   Among the riders on the pilgrimage to Wounded Knee was former
American Indian Movement leader Russell Means, who declared
Thursday that there is little left for the radical Indian
organization to accomplish because tribes have learned to speak for
themselves.
   ``There's no need for AIM to be a vanguard,'' Means said in an
interview at Kyle, about 20 miles northeast of Wounded Knee.
``We're still around and we still make statements, but we're no
longer needed because the Indian people have collectively risen up
and said what they want to say independently.''
   Means, who helped lead a takeover of Wounded Knee in 1973, said
his return to the site had him ``swelling with a tremendous amount
of prideful emotion.''
   ``Wounded Knee proved to Indian people that it's all right to
stand up and be an Indian, and that it's even worth fighting for,''
he said.
   Means helped organize an armed 71-day occupation of Wounded Knee
on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation 17 years ago. Two men were
killed and several others wounded in the action that divided the
Sioux Nation.
   Resulting indictments against Means and about 115 others were
dismissed by a judge.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Suez Canal chief played down Iraq's
threat to block navigation in the international waterway in the
event of war.
   The Suez chairman, Mohamed Ezzat Adel, said his men can remove
any obstacle in the strategic waterway that links the Mediterranean
with the Red Sea within 48 hours.
   Adel made the remarks in a statement scheduled for publication
Saturday in the state newspaper Akhbar El-Yom. The weekly said the
comments were made in reaction to Iraqi threats to block navigation
in the canal.
   He said it is hard for anything to block the canal because its
navigation width is about 630 feet.
   The canal was widened several times under successive development
plans carried out after Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in
1979.
   Adel also said the canal authority would lose about $4.3 million
daily if war broke out in the Persian Gulf. He said 36 percent of
gulf trade with the outside world was passing through the canal
before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Since then, he said, the canal has been losing 29 percent of its
income.
   He said navigation safety is being supervised by ``high security
authorities.'' The reference could mean that the presidency and the
Egyptian intelligence service are overseeing security of the canal.
   Adel told Egyptian new media three days ago that authorities are
stepping up security in the canal.
   Canal sources first disclosed the heightened security to The
Associated Press a week ago. They said the aim was to prevent a
possible Iraqi attempt to scuttle a vessel in the waterway and
block it.
   Sealing the 101-mile-long canal would greatly curtail the flow
of troops and arms from Atlantic and Mediterranean points to the
U.S.-dominated multinational force countering Iraq.

   Iraq on Friday test-fired a
surface-to-surface missile for the second time this week, shooting
it away from multinational forces in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Central
Command said.
   ``The firing appeared to be part of an additional testing or
training mission,'' said Air Force Lt. Casey Mahon, a Central
Command spokesman.
   Mahon said the missile landed in Iraq. He could not comment on
the alert status of the 300,000 U.S. troops in Operation Desert
Shield during the firing. Details about the flight path or the kind
of missile were also not released.
   Reporters visiting the U.S. hospital ship Mercy said crew
members went on a heightened state of alert because of the missile
launch, carrying their protective gear against chemical weapons
with them.
   Land-based troops were already on a heightened alert because of
the possibility of a terrorist attack over the Christmas and New
Year holidays.
   Iraq test-fired a missile Wednesday under nearly identical
circumstances, the U.S. military said.
   British and U.S. military officials said Iraq test-fired SCUD
missiles from east to west Dec. 2. Fired north to south, the
missiles would hit Saudi Arabia, where multinational forces
confront Iraq following its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Concern has been expressed that the pressure of the Jan. 15 U.N.
deadline allowing use of force against Iraq unless it withderaws
from Kuwait might prompt Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to launch a
pre-emptive strike. Saddam has threatened to hit Israel first to
split the Arab and Western coalition ranged against him.

<TEXT>
   A woman has been named commander of an active U.S.
Navy vessel for the first time, officials said Friday.
   Lt. Cmdr. Darlene M. Iskra was installed as commander of the
salvage vessel USS Opportune on Thursday night after Cmdr. Edgar J.
Jones was flown back to the United States for a medical emergency,
said Lt. Scott Campbell, public information officer for U.S. naval
support activity in Naples.
   ``We've never had a female commanding officer of a deployable
ship or ship that can be sent overseas,'' Campbell said. ``There's
a little bit of naval history being made here.''
   Iskra will command an all-male crew of about 100, Campbell said.
   Iskra, a special operations officer, is the most senior female
diving officer in the Navy and is a graduate of officers' candidate
school in Newport, R.I., Campbell said.
   She had originally been scheduled to succeed Jones on Jan. 24.
   The USS Opportune is assigned to the U.S. Sixth Fleet, based in
Naples. It is a noncombatant vessel, said Campbell.
   As a result, the vessel will not be involved in military action
in the event of a war in the Persian Gulf. However, the ship could
be sent to an area outside the war zone to provide support.
   The ship is responsible for recovering equipment or the wreckage
of ships or planes from the sea, and sometimes makes repairs to
Navy vessels, Campbell said. It also tows disabled ships.
   The next woman scheduled to receive command of a Navy ship is
Cmdr. Deborah Gernes, a surface warfare officer. She is scheduled
to be installed in December 1991 and will command the USS Cimarron,
Campbell said.
   Nearly 11 percent of all officers in the U.S. Navy are female,
Campbell said.

   Christopher Justice was accused of two crimes by
a prosecutor: setting fire to a house and using a racial slur to
describe the inhabitants.
   ``Don't worry, it's just a bunch of niggers,'' Justice allegedly
told neighbors after the fire.
   District Judge Thomas Shea agreed there was enough evidence to
order Justice to stand trial on the arson charge. But he said the
U.S. Constitution protected Justice's right to say whatever he
wanted about his neighbors, contrary to Michigan's law prohibiting
ethnic intimidation.
   The law, which took effect April 1, 1989, makes it a crime to
threaten or harm persons or their property because of their race,
religion or ethnic background. Conviction carries a maximum penalty
of two years in prison and allows a jury to award triple damages to
a plaintiff.
   At least 30 other states have similar laws.
   Shea's Nov. 28 quashing of the law applies only to his
five-township jurisdiction about 20 miles west of Detroit. But
Prosecutor William Delhey said he's afraid that eastern Washtenaw
County could become a haven of hatred.
   ``We think Judge Shea was wrong and we want a determination of
the constitutionality of the ethnic intimidation statute so it will
be applied uniformly in the entire county,'' Delhey said.
   Justice, 21, of Superior Township, remains jailed in lieu of a
$500,000 bond on the arson charge stemming from the Nov. 9 fire at
the home of Sherwin McDonald. A trial before Circuit Judge Patrick
Conlin is scheduled March 18. Justice faces up to 20 years'
imprisonment if convicted.
   Delhey's office has asked Conlin to reinstate the ethnic
intimidation charge, and he might rule by the end of January, said
David Lady, chief assistant prosecutor.
   Shea said the law was unconstitutional because it violated First
Amendment guarantees of free speech and was too vaguely worded. The
American Civil Liberties Union agrees with him.
   ``The law's too vague to be able to stand,'' said Howard Simon,
Michigan ACLU director. ``The appellate courts have got to come
down with an interpretation.''
   Justice's attorney, Don Ferris, believes the law violates free
speech. But he also said prosecutors failed to prove Justice was
motivated by prejudice.
   Ferris said no evidence was introduced at Justice's preliminary
hearing that indicated he knew the McDonalds were black, or
threatened them before the fire. The alleged racial statements were
uttered after the fire and not to the McDonalds but to neighbors,
who said Justice was drunk, the lawyer said.
   ``The problem with the law is, as Judge Shea ruled, parts of it
are not very properly defined,'' Ferris said. ``The less clear the
words are in a statute, it gives prosecutors ... a lot more
discretion in applying the law.''
   The author of Michigan's ethnic intimidation law predicted
Shea's ruling would be reversed.
   ``It's definitely constitutional,'' state Sen.-elect David
Honigman said. ``It doesn't regulate any kind of speech whatsoever.
It regulates conduct.''
   Similar laws in other states have survived challenges on
constitutional grounds, Honigman said.
   The triple damages portion of the law has yet to be used.
Honigman said the provision was meant to cripple organized hate
groups.
   ``We can't legislate good will,'' he said. ``But we can make ill
will terribly costly.''
   McDonald, 29, a Ford Motor Co. engineer, said Shea's ruling
added insult to the injury of having lost his home in the fire.
   ``If this isn't ethnic intimidation, nothing is,'' said
McDonald, who now lives with his wife and twin daughters in an
apartment. ``We always thought our girls would grow up in Washtenaw
County. But if this is the type of judge that represents Washtenaw
County, then maybe that won't be.
   ``Maybe we'll have to move back to Detroit, where it's safe.''

   The Pentagon announced Friday it plans to
vaccinate troops in the Persian Gulf against possible germ warfare
attacks by Iraq, and a 17-ship carrier armada set sail to bring
America's naval deployment in the region to a level unprecedented
since the Vietnam war.
   The naval reinforcements, scheduled to arrive in the gulf in
about two weeks, are carrying 16,000 Marines and sailors and
include the carriers USS America and Theodore Roosevelt, each with
about 80 warplanes, from the Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia.
   They will join three other carriers in the area - the USS
Saratoga in the eastern Mediterranean, the USS Midway in the
Arabian Sea and the USS Kennedy in the Red Sea.
   The fresh troops will bring the United States closer to its goal
of having about 430,000 in Saudi Arabia and nearby waters to
confront Iraq if it refuses to withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15 -
the deadline imposed by the United Nations.
   Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it was preparing to inoculate
troops against possible germ warfare by Iraq.
   ``We are committed to providing maximum protection for our
troops, including protection against chemical and biological
weapons,'' said a brief statement. ``We expect to begin a program
of inoculations soon,'' it said, but did not provide further
detail.
   The New York Times, which first reported the plan, said the
inoculations could begin ``in a matter of weeks.'' It also said the
United States doesn't yet have sufficient vaccines for all its
troops in the gulf.
   In London, the British Defense Ministry said British troops
taking part in Operation Desert Shield also would receive
inoculations. The ministry said it was issuing gas masks to about
British 21,000 civilians in the area.
   Britain is contributing about 21,000 troops to the anti-Iraq
force.
   In other developments Friday, Iraq test fired a
surface-to-surface missile for the second time this week. The U.S.
Central Command in Saudi Arabia reported that the missle was fired
away from multinational forces, and that it landed within Iraq.
   Military analysts also said that thousands of Iraqis have been
trained for suicide attacks on the U.S.-led forces if war breaks
out.
   CIA Director William Webster has said in recent weeks that Iraq
has sizable stockpiles of biological weapons. Iraq denied the
allegations.
   Biological weapons are basically germs - viruses and bacteria -
that cause diseases such as cholera, anthrax, typhoid, botulism.
They can be delivered by warheads on missiles, by low-flying planes
spreading the germs much like a crop duster, or by contamination of
water supplies.
   Unlike nuclear or even chemical arms, biological weapons are
easy to make because they rely on the kind of agents and equipment
used in manufacturing pharmaceuticals and are readily available on
world markets.
   The U.S. Commerce Department, for example, approved more than 20
shipments of biological agents to the Iraqi government, according
to a congressional staffer investigating the sales. The U.S.
company which sold the agents believed they would be used for
vaccinations, said the official.
   Defenses against germ warfare include protective clothing,
masks, and vaccines.
   Experts caution, however, that dozens of diseases can be
converted into weapons - making it hard to know against which to
inoculate.
   Also, it could take one month or longer to develop immunity to
some of the diseases after being vaccinated, said Dr. Sanford
Kuvin, vice chairman of the National Foundation for Infectious
Diseases.
   One of the diseases Iraq is believed to have in its arsenal is
anthrax, an easily transmittable and severely incapacitating
illness.
   The vaccine, however, is not commercially available because the
only people who need it in this country are those handling imported
raw hides and goat hair.
   The vaccine is only made by Michigan's public health lab, which
is having trouble keeping up with the demands for gulf troops,
Newsweek reported.
   Another disease Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is known to have
in his arsenal is botulism, a form of stomach poisoning which is
treatable with antibiotics but against which there is no vaccine.
   The United States wasn't the only nation gearing up for a
possible fight.
   In London, the government ordered the call-up of 390 medical
reservists for service in the gulf after getting too few
volunteers. The British are members of the anti-Iraq coalition.
   And, to prevent being stranded by war, more than 250 Soviet
citizens left Iraq Friday and 1,000 others were to be evacuated by
Jan. 10. Soviet Deputy Premier Igor Belousov met with officials in
Baghdad seeking to terminate numerous commercial contracts with
Iraq.
   But Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu urged talks with Iraq
on averting war.
   The State Department said, however, that there hadn't been any
progress in efforts to arrange a meeting between Secretary of State
James Baker and Saddam. Iraq wants Jan. 12 as the meeting date but
Baker says he won't go after Jan. 3.
   For the second day in a row, the senior U.S. diplomat in
Baghdad, Joseph C. Wilson, did not have any contact with the Iraqi
foreign ministry, said Mark Dillen, a State Department spokesman.

   As world leaders debate Saddam Hussein's
nuclear potential, the list of German companies alleged to have
helped him advance Iraq's atomic technology grows.
   At least 100 German companies are suspected of helping Iraq
develop its unconventional weapons capability, sources say. German
officials won't say how many of those are being investigated for
suspected nuclear technology exports.
   The news magazine Der Spiegel said this week that ``several
dozen'' European companies were implicated and listed six German
companies with some reported connection to Iraq's weapons program.
   ``I would not like to be George Bush and going to bed tonight''
with the uncertainty over whether Iraq has a nuclear bomb, said
Kenneth Timmerman, editor of the Paris-based Middle East Defense
News.
   Spiegel and the specialized McGraw-Hill publication,
NuclearFuel, both alleged this week that German companies are
suspected of supplying Iraq with sophisticated technology to make
weapons-grade uranium.
   The companies and individuals named in the reports deny any
wrongdoing.
   It is not clear how far along Iraq might be toward making a
nuclear bomb.
   The British newspaper, The Sunday Times, reported earlier this
month that Iraq might be only a year away from the goal.
   But a major source for its report, German engineer Bruno
Stemmler, denied the paper's time frame in an interview Thursday.
He said, based on a 1988 visit to Iraq, the country was at least
five years from building a centrifuge that could make enriched
uranium. It would then take several more years before a series of
centrifuges, called cascades, could come on line.
   At least 1,000 cascades are needed for bomb production.
   Spiegel predicted it would be eight to 10 years before Iraq
could build a bomb.
   ``Iraq is acquiring enrichment technology,'' a German official
said on condition of anonymity. ``It's not believed that Iraq is
now producing highly enriched uranium in significant quantities.''
   But he said, without elaborating: ``You cannot exclude that they
are doing something ... on an experimental level.''
   The official, with access to intelligence data, said Iraq could
be from two to seven years away from an atomic weapon.
   Timmerman, however, who chronicled Iraq's acquisition of poison
gas in a book, said Friday that information he's received ``is so
disturbing and the extent of delivery to Iraq from Germany and
other places would appear so great, that I would not feel safe
saying that Iraq does not have a bomb today.''
   NuclearFuel has cited a secret government report it obtained
last fall from the Economics Ministry, which monitors export
regulations. The report says German centrifuge design may have been
provided to Iraq by two engineers who formerly worked for a German
centrifuge design company, MAN Technologien GmbH.
   It quoted a source who attended a secret briefing on the report
as saying Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann ``told us that
centrifuge equipment sent to Iraq was of German origin.''
   In addition, officials have confirmed that customs officers last
summer intercepted a German shipment of centrifuge parts at
Frankfurt airport bound for Iraq.
   The International Atomic Energy Agency reviewed Iraq's declared
nuclear facilities in November, under the terms of Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, of which Iraq is one of 141 signatories.
The agency said it found nothing unexpected.
   So far, only one arrest has been reported in the scandal. The
director of a Bonn-based weapons supplier remains under
investigation for alleged export violations, officials say.
   Companies in other countries, including the United States,
Britain, Switzerland and Brazil, have also been named in connection
with suspected Iraqi nuclear development.
   As allegations mount against German companies, so does
frustration in Washington.
   ``We know what the Germans are up to,'' said a U.S. Senate
source on condition of anonymity. ``There is only an argument over
how long it takes before he gets the bomb.'' He referred to Iraq's
Saddam.
   German officials deny they are being lax. But one source in
Bonn's inner circle said: ``Have you seen the harbor in Hamburg,
you just can't control every container.''
   Germany's federalist justice system also makes it difficult to
halt violations, despite tough new export laws.
   Laws are drafted by the Economics Ministry, enforced through the
Finance Ministry's Customs police, who can turn the case over to
local authorities for further investigation and potential charges.
   Lutz Stavenhagen, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's top intelligence
adviser, has suggested letting the country's counterespionage unit
investigate suspected export violations. But the proposal is likely
to meet with strong resistance in a country that remembers Hitler's
police state.
   The latest allegations of German nuclear help to Iraq follows
last week's announcement that the United States gave Germany a list
of 50 companies suspected of breaking the international embargo
against Iraq.
   A government official said Friday that of 87 companies under
review, 16 had been cleared and 10 were being further investigated
for allegedly preparing to break the embargo. The other cases are
pending.

<HEAD>Deputies Charge Vote Irregularities in Vice-President Balloting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reformist lawmakers on Friday questioned the
fairness of this week's parliamentary election of Vice President
Gennady Yanayev, alleging that ballots were incorrectly counted.
   The Interregional Group of Deputies, which represents 229
deputies in the Congress of People's Deputies, showed reporters
what they said were seven ballots that were not submitted for
tabulation at the Thursday session that elected Yanayev, Tass
reported.
   Parliament officials charged with counting the votes had
reported that only five ballots were not put into ballot boxes
during the vote, the official news agency said, raising questions
about other possible discrepancies.
   The group, founded by the late human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov, also echoed accusations that approval of strong new
presidential powers was dangerous.
   The country ``is heading toward dictatorship where the key role
is assigned to repressive bodies and violence could become the
major means of solving internal political issues,'' the group said
in a statement.
   Yanayev was elected on the second ballot at the end of the
stormy 10-day session, after deputies initially rejected his
nomination by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   On the first secret ballot, deputies voted 1,089-583 for
Yanayev, leaving him 31 votes short of the margin needed for
confirmation. Parliament election officials recorded 107
abstentions and invalidated 113 ballots for unspecified reasons.
   Yanayev needed a simple majority of 1,120 votes out of the 2,239
registered members of the parliament.
   The total number of deputies attending the session was lower
than the number registered. At least three delegations from
secessionist republics were boycotting and an unknown number of
other were absent for various reasons.
   The parliament earlier this week approved nearly every
constitutional amendment Gorbachev wanted to reorganize the
government under direct presidential control. Some lawmakers said
that by rejecting his nominee, the usually obedient parliament
showed its deep dissatisfaction with Yanayev in the potentially
powerful and visible new job.
   But Gorbachev, determined to win confirmation of the 53-year-old
career Communist Party official, argued that he needed a man he
could trust in the job and persuaded deputies to vote again.
   On the second secret ballot, deputies voted 1,230-563 for
Yanayev, surpassing the 1,120 votes needed for a simple majority.
   The remaining ballots were not filled out or were declared
invalid, but the exact numbers were unavailable.
   It was also unclear whether the same number of ballots in the
first vote - 1,847 - were distributed in the second vote. If so,
that would have left just 54 abstentions or invalid ballots in the
second vote, down significantly from the 120 in the first vote.
   After the first vote, speakers had implored the deputies to vote
during the second round and support Gorbachev.
   ``A political battle is going on and you can't get away from it
- you must choose,'' said Marshall Sergei F. Akhromeyev, a
presidential adviser and former armed forces chief of staff.
   Meanwhile Friday, the dramatic resignation during the parliament
of Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze continued to reverberate
in the media.
   The State Committee for Television and Radio, known as
Gostelradio, canceled two episodes of ``Vzglyad,'' one of the
Soviet Union's most popular television programs, because it
disapproves of its political coverage, the show's host said.
   Alexander Lyubimov said the shows were scheduled to include
stories about Shevardnadze, including a frank interview in which he
said he considered quitting as foreign minister to protest
shootings by Soviet troops in his native Georgia. Shevardnadze
resigned over another issue last week.
   Program officials saw the cancellation as a return tostate
censorship clearly done for political reasons.

   More than a dozen bicycle-riding gang members
fatally stabbed a woman and injured her husband during a robbery
spree, authorities said Friday.
   Ten people were robbed in as many minutes in the Thursday
evening rampage in the Watts section, said homicide Detective Larry
Kallestad.
   Police described the 15 young men taken into custody as gang
members.
   Tomasa Rivas, 44, died from a stab wound to the chest when she
and her husband were attacked while walking home with bags of
groceries.
   Ms. Rivas was attacked when she ran toward her 52-year-old
husband, Jesus Rivas, who had just been stabbed, Kallestad said.
Rivas was in stable condition Friday after surgery at Martin Luther
King Jr.-Drew Medical Center.
   The Rivases were the only stabbing victims, Kallestad said. Two
victims received minor injuries struggling with their assailants
but did not require hospitalization, he said.
   Eight of the young men arrested were released Friday after
witnesses failed to identify them in a lineup, authorities said.
Detective E. Nathan said seven others, four juveniles and three
adults, were booked for investigation of murder and robbery.
   The names of those taken into custody were withheld, she said.
Arraignments were expected Monday.
   ``We've released eight of the suspects but that doesn't mean
that they're home free,'' Kallestad said. ``We're not sure we've
got all of them.''
   Kallestad said a police helicopter followed a group of
bicyclists fleeing from the area of the last robbery. ``They all
ran into one house and were taken into custody there.''
   He said stolen purses and other evidence was recovered at the
house.

<HEAD>Albania Approves Opposition Newspaper, Media Get More Independence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania's Communist government legalized
the first opposition newspaper on Friday and announced greater
independence for television and other news media, the state news
agency ATA reported.
   In a dispatch monitored in Vienna, ATA said the Council of
Ministers decided to allow the Democratic Party to publish a
newspaper and to make directors of ATA and of official television
and radio responsible to the state, indicating the Communist Party
would have less direct control.
   An official journalist reached by telephone in the capital of
Tirana said Communist-sponsored directors would probably keep their
posts for the moment.
   The ministers also decided to set up a commission to draft a
news media law for approval by Parliament after Feb. 10 elections,
ATA said.
   ``Up to now there was no law regulating the media. I understand
this move to mean more independence from the party,'' the
journalist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   President Ramiz Alia has sped up political reform since student
protests over dormitory conditions this month grew into demands for
democracy in Albania, Europe's last holdout for hard-line
Communism.
   The Communists, in power since 1944, still control nearly all
spheres of public life, including the media.
   Gramoz Pashko, a co-founder of the recently legalized Democratic
Party, said Friday's decision meant the planned newspaper Rilindja
Demokratika, or Democratic Revival, would go to press ``in the next
day or two.''
   He said in a telephone interview that the Democrats held a rally
Friday in the central city of Elbasan - their second rally outside
Tirana - and estimated that 35,000 people attended.
   Pashko reported no police interference and no incidents.
   He said the government authorized use of state-owned presses at
a fee to print the paper. A first edition of 100,000 is planned, to
be distributed around Albania by students and other supporters for
a one lek (10-cent) cover price, he added.
   Pashko said the paper would also be sold to Albanian communities
in neighboring Yugoslavia and elsewhere abroad - ``We shall cover
the costs and, by selling abroad, raise funds for the party.''
   The price for the eight-page paper was three times that of the
Communist Party daily Zeri i Popullit.
   An electoral law, adopted before the Democratic Party was
legalized, forbids political parties to receive foreign funding,
but Pashko said raising funds through newspaper sales was legal.
   Four decrees by the Council of Ministers on Friday were all
signed by Premier Adil Carcani.
   One says newspapers would not be allowed to publish articles
calling for overthrow of the constitutional order or other
``destabilizing acts,'' said an Albanian radio report monitored by
the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Pashko confirmed reports by the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug that
the Communists organized counterrallies Friday in Tirana and other
Albanian cities, but he said attendance was ``sparse ... and mainly
old people were there.''
   Speakers at the opposition rally asked popular support for the
Democratic Party's demands that February elections be postponed for
two or three months, to allow the Democrats more time to organize
an effective campaign.
   Even with a newspaper, the opposition must rely mainly on
word-of-mouth and rallies to propagate its cause in this small,
isolated Balkan nation of 3.2 million, with its poor roads and
communications.
   The government on Monday rejected the request for a
postponement, saying urgently needed reforms and constitutional
changes require that parliamentary elections as soon as possible.
   Alia on Wednesday acknowledged there ``have been mistakes'' in
the 46 years of one-party rule. He pledged to reform the Communist
Party and remove the Communists' guaranteed leading role in society
from the constitution.
   He also promised reforms to shore up Albania's isolationist
economy, now on the brink of collapse.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Optimistic About Soviet Investigation of Katyn Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials investigating the
massacre of 15,000 Polish officers during World War II are
conducting a ``thorough and comprehensive'' probe, a Polish
prosecutor said Friday.
   Deputy Prosecutor General Stefan Sniezko said Soviet military
prosecutors showed him 35 volumes of files relating to the 1940
Katyn massacre, including such details as schedules for trains that
carried the prisoners.
   After 47 years of denials, the Soviet government in April
admitted responsibility for the murders, which it had previously
blamed on the Nazis. On Dec. 18, Polish prosecutors were allowed
their first look at the documents, Sniezko said.
   A total of 4,254 Polish prisoners, including the cream of the
Polish intelligentsia and 800 doctors, were executed and stacked in
mass graves by the Soviet secret police in the Katyn forest, near
the city of Smolensk.
   The bodies were found by German troops moving east through
Russia in 1943.
   But until the current investigation, the whereabouts of an
additional 10,000 Poles who were interned in camps at Starobielsk
and Ostashkov, northwest of Moscow, had been a mystery.
   Sniezko said that the Soviet military prosecutors, who took over
the case in October after the personal intervention of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, hoped to chart the fate of each victim.
   Polish experts have been invited to attend an exhumation of
bodies next year near Kharkhov in the southern Ukraine, Sniezko
said.
   Referred to as the ``second Katyn,'' the site found in June is
likely to contain bodies of prisoners from the nearby Starobielsk
camp.
   Poles regard the murders as evidence of Stalin's drive to
prevent the resurrection of an independent Polish state after Nazi
Germany and the Soviets divided Poland between them in 1939.

   Israeli leaders assured Jordan on Friday that
they intend to remain at peace with the neighboring kingdom.
Tensions have risen with reports of military buildups on both sides
of the border.
   Jordan, which has shown sympathy for neighboring Iraq, has
reinforced its security forces along the cease-fire line with
Israel as a precaution against an attack by the Jewish state,
Jordanian military sources said Thursday.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, during a meeting with visiting
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner, said Israel is
carefully monitoring the events in Jordan but ``wants to live with
it like good neighbors,'' Israel radio reported.
   ``The real interest of Jordan is to keep any country, any
foreign element from entering Jordan. ... Jordanian officials have
presented this as one of the reasons for the present increased
level of defensive alert,'' said Israel's Chief of Staff Lt. Gen.
Dan Shomron.
   Shomron, in a speech in Tel Aviv on Friday, said Israel wants to
prevent ``any alien element and of course the Iraqis'' from
invading Jordan. Israel has repeatedly issued such warnings to
Jordan, which it fears Iraq may use as a springboard for an attack
on Israel.
   However, ``the Jordanians are wrong in assuming that we plan to
invade Jordan, to harm it and to seize territory. We have no such
intentions, and I'm also saying that reports that we are massing
troops on the Jordanian border are simply not true,'' Shomron said.

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mentally ill woman who refused to
have a court-ordered abortion has given birth to a boy.
   Denise Lefebvre, who spent much of her pregnancy strapped to a
hospital bed to protect staff from her violent outbursts, had the
baby Wednesday, said her guardian, Kathleen Phillips.
   The 5-pound, 10-ounce infant, who wasn't expected until January,
suffered no obvious ill effects from Lefebvre's medication for
severe manic depression, Phillips said.
   ``It's a sad and happy occasion,'' said Phillips, who became
Lefebvre's guardian when she was declared mentally incompetent in
September. ``We have a baby, but who knows what will happen to the
baby. Denise is very ill.''
   Who will be the child's guardian has yet to be decided, but
Phillips said the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services likely will take custody of the boy.
   The birth at Broward General Medical Center will allow Lefebvre
to resume powerful drugs she was taking before she stopped last
spring for fear it would hurt her unborn child. She quickly slipped
into a deep psychotic state, prompting doctors at Broward General
to seek a court-ordered abortion they said was necessary to save
her life.
   Lefebvre insisted on keeping her baby. But without her
medication, Lefebvre was attacking and accosting her doctors,
urinating and defecating on herself and refusing to sleep or eat.
   In September, after the case bounced through south Florida's
courts, a judge declared Lefebvre mentally incompetent and
appointed Phillips to act on her behalf.
   Phillips and the doctors agreed to help Lefebvre have her baby.
   Lefebvre's ordeal drew the attention of pro-choice and
anti-abortion groups, which united in support of her decision to
keep the baby.
   Phillips said Lefebvre is reacting to her baby the way any
mother might.
   ``She's very happy,'' Phillips said. ``I don't think she
realizes what will happen to the baby.''

   The Supreme Court on Friday refused to block
the $7.4 billion purchase of movie-making MCA Inc. by Japan's
largest electronics company.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, acting without any written opinion,
first rejected an emergency request by Go-Video Inc. to block
consummation of the deal set for Saturday.
   Go-Video then turned to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who referred
the matter to his colleagues.
   The court announced in the early evening that all nine justices,
again acting without a written opinion, had refused to act.
   Go-Video sought a postponement until a formal antitrust
challenge could be mounted.
   A federal judge in Arizona and the San Francisco-based 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals previously had turned down Go-Video's
request.
   It will be the largest Japanese purchase of a U.S. company,
providing giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. the
entertainment ``software'' - programs of all kinds - it needed to
complement its electronics ``hardware.''
   The combination mirrors one struck by Sony Corp., which bought
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $5 billion a year ago.
   Matsushita is familiar to American consumers through brand names
such as Panasonic, Technics and Quasar.
   MCA, which runs Universal Studios, has grown into a colossus of
films (``E.T. the Extra-Terrestial,'' ``Jaws,'' ``Back to the
Future''), records (Reba McEntire, Elton John, Guns N' Roses) and
television (``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``Major Dad''). It also owns
Florida and California theme parks.
   In seeking to block the purchase, Go-Video contended that
Matsushita's takeover would lessen competition in the ``software''
industry.
   In rejecting that argument last week, U.S. District Judge Robert
Broomfield in Phoenix said, ``I'm simply not persuaded that the
proposed merger is necessarily anti-competitive.''
   The case is Go-Video vs. Matsushita Electric, A-498.

   Rescuers drilled a hole in the hull of
a capsized barge off Finland and saved two crew, but officials said
Friday that although divers continued to search, eight more missing
men were thought dead.
   Olli Lommi, 36, first mate, and Jouko Kosonen, 41, chief
engineer, were rescued late Thursday after being trapped for nine
hours in an air pocket in the engine room of the upturned Finnish
vessel Finn-Baltic.
   Rescuers working in a snowstorm and heavy winds had redoubled
their efforts after hearing tapping inside the barge.
   The 550-foot, 15,000-ton barge, including a motorized ``pusher''
section, capsized in rough weather off the southwestern port of
Hanko at about 1 p.m. on Thursday while carrying iron ore between
Finnish ports. News reports said it overturned in 10 seconds
because the barge took on water and the cargo shifted.
   Strong winds and rain forced rescuers to stop searching late
Thursday but operations resumed after weather conditions improved
Friday morning.
   The barge was reported entirely submerged at first, but
officials said it later drifted into shallower water and part of it
jutted a dozen feet or more above the surface, allowing rescuers to
walk on the hull.
   ``We don't believe anyone else is alive in the pusher-barge, but
we have a dozen or so divers trying to get into the vessel from the
underneath,'' Nils Radstedt, deputy chief of the Hanko Coast Guard,
said.
   The pusher-barge had nine Finnish crewmen and a pilot on board.
   Rescue officials declined to speculate on why the vessel sailed
in winds of up to 62 mph.
   ``We just don't know and we will leave that upto the special
investigation committee. All we know is that it happened very
quickly and there was no warning,'' Radstedt said in a telephone
interview.
   Jan-Eric Dahlberg, the security chief of FG Shipping, the barge
owner, said, ``The two survivors said they had sailed in worse
conditions before. This vessel was built to sail in rough seas.''
   Radstedt said heat from the pusher's engine helped keep Lommi
and Kosonen alive while a snow storm raged outside. ``They were in
good health when taken to the Hanko Medical Center.''
   ``The (rescued) men said they think there are eight others
trapped in the ship. But there is no hope that they are still
alive,'' Radstedt said.
   In a separate incident, the German freighter Transgermania which
hit a rock Thursday was being towed into Turku on Finland's west
coast.
   Rescue officials said the Finnish-built roll-on roll-off vessel
had a cargo of dangerous chemicals but danger had passed that it
would sink.
   None of Transgermania's 22 German crew were in danger, said Jari
Simi of the Turku Maritime Rescue Coordination Center.
   ``There are still 12 crew on the ship and 15 firemen pumping
water out. Three tugs are pulling the vessel and there is no danger
now,'' Simi said.
   Earlier, 10 crewmen were evacuated from the sinking ship which
had worked itself free off the rock and listed dangerously. The
ship's pumps, main engine and anchor chain broke in the storm.

   The militant Pan Africanist
Congress said Friday it has been holding talks with Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress about joining forces in a
united front against apartheid.
   In another development, Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee announced
that the government will help an anti-apartheid group with the
repatriation of thousands of political exiles expected to return
soon.
   The return of exiles has been a key demand by the ANC and other
major opposition groups. If exiles begin returning in large
numbers, it will help improve the climate for black-white
negotiations between the government and opposition groups.
   Pan Africanist President Clarence Makwetu said in a New Year's
message Friday, ``1991 will be characterized by the creation of a
united front or patriotic front of the principal liberation
movements.
   ``In this regard, it pleases us to announce that preparatory
discussions between the PAC and the ANC for the creation of a
united or patriotic front are proceeding with great promise.'' .
   Leaders of both organizations have said black opposition groups
should confront the white-led government together, but they have
many disagreements.
   ANC spokeswoman Gill Marcus said as far as she knew there have
been ``very, very preliminary'' discussions.
   She added, ``Unity isn't something simply declared on a piece of
paper or achieved in talks. It must be forged on the ground, in
action. ... You have to have certain common basic principles.''
   Such unity could be difficult to achieve for the ANC, the Pan
Africanist Congress, and Inkatha Freedom Party, the largest
anti-apartheid groups. They are split by deep rivalries.
   The Pan Africanist Congress was formed in 1960 by militants who
broke away from the more moderate ANC. It refuses to recognize the
white-led government and has rejected an invitation to join current
talks involving the ANC and government. The negotiations are
intended to open the way for full-scale talks on giving majority
blacks a say in the country's political system.
   Both the Pan Africanist Congress and ANC support international
sanctions to pressure the government to end apartheid, the official
system of racial separation. But the conservative Inkatha Freedom
Party opposes sanctions.
   In addition, supporters of the ANC and Inkatha Freedom Party
have waged virtual warfare for five years in Natal province. The
fighting spilled over to the townships around Johannesburg in
August. More than 3,000 people have died this year in the unrest.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid. But they differ on
tactics for fighting it and on their vision of a future South
Africa.
   Coetsee announced on Thursday that the government has appointed
two senior officials to work with the National Coordinating
Committee for the Repatriation of South African Exiles.
   The repatriation committee, headed by anti-apartheid activist
Rev. Frank Chikane, has urged the government to allow the United
Nations to play a role in the process. But Coetsee's statement did
not address the issue of U.N. involvement.
   The ministry will help identify problems related to exiles'
return and bring them to the attention of appropriate officials,
the statement said.
   The government agreed in August to allow the return of tens of
thousands of exiles. But the process has bogged down as the
government and the ANC have tried to resolve a variety of issues.
   The ANC has demanded blanket amnesty for exiles. But the
government says exiles who fled prosecution for specific crimes
must apply for amnesty and will have their cases judged
individually.
   The exact number of exiles is unknown. The ANC says about 20,000
of its members are in exile.

   Snow also fell in northwest New York state and southern New
Jersey. In Pennsylvania, 10 to 16 inches fell overnight in
Somerset, Cambria, Blair, Bedford, Fulton and Franklin counties.
   In the Pacific Northwest, winter storm warnings were posted over
eastern Washington state, Oregon's Willamette Valley and Columbia
Gorge, and northern and central Idaho. High winds in the Seattle
area whipped the Puget Sound into a froth.
   Blizzard warnings were posted for northwest and central Montana
and winter storm warnings were issued for the northwest and western
mountains of Wyoming.
   In North Dakota, temperatures ranged from around zero in the
extreme southwest to about 20 below northwest part of the state.
Winds of 25 to 35 mph brought the wind chill index down to 35 below
to 60 below.
   Snow fell in the afternoon over upper Michigan, northern
Wisconsin, northern Minnesota, northwest Iowa, much of North and
South Dakota, Nebraska, Montana and Idaho.

   The only emergency room doctor on duty at a
hospital was arrested because he didn't respond quickly enough to a
police request to draw blood from a suspected drunken driver,
officials said.
   Clarkson Hospital officials said Thursday the emergency room was
left unattended for about an hour when Dr. Bruce Harvey was
arrested for obstructing an officer.
   Dennis Earl, the hospital's associate administrator, said Harvey
wanted to attend to patients, including one with heart problems,
before he complied with the police request Tuesday night to draw
blood for a blood alcohol test.
   The police officer, Michael Thomas, wanted him to draw the blood
immediately. State law allows police to make such requests of
hospitals.
   ``I told him that the more time that was wasted could seriously
affect the results of the test,'' Thomas said.
   Thomas said the doctor was handcuffed, taken downtown for
booking and returned to the hospital after about 45 minutes. Earl
said Harvey was not allowed to telephone for a replacement doctor.

<HEAD>Millionaire Recluse Dies In Fire; Leaves $1 Million To Charity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reclusive millionaire killed when fire
gutted his cluttered home left more than $1 million to charity, his
attorney said.
   Nathan Rounds, 76, had no close relatives, showed little
interest in money or taxes and rarely went anywhere in the past
decade, said attorney Joseph T. Thompson.
   ``He wasn't unpleasant,'' Thompson said. ``He just liked to keep
to himself and wasn't a sociable person. He was acquainted with
Howard Hughes at one time and he was a recluse.''
   Thompson said his client spent his last years secluded like
Hughes and had attended the 1947 flight of the multimillionaire's
``Spruce Goose'' flying boat.
   The attorney said Rounds left an estate worth more than $1
million and directed in his will that the money be donated to
charity. The will does not specify how the money should be spent.
   Rounds died early Wednesday of apparent smoke inhalation after
he fell while trying to escape a fire that gutted his $560,000 home
in Sherman Oaks, said police Detective Mark Rooney.
   ``To say the house was cluttered does not come close to
describing it,'' Rooney said. ``It was like an obstacle course
without a path.''
   There was no indication of foul play, Rooney said.
   Several small electric heaters placed all over the house may
have caused the fire, Rooney said.
   An autopsy was scheduled Friday but preliminary results were not
available from the Los Angeles County coroner's office.
   Rounds inherited his fortune from parents who found him on a
church step and adopted him. He showed little interest in the trust
fund his parents left after they died, Thompson said.
   ``He didn't try to invest to make more money and didn't file his
income taxes on time,'' Thompson said. ``I never knew him to be
employed. He didn't need to be. I heard he drove race cars as a
young man.''
   Thompson said he met Rounds two or three times a year to deliver
stock dividend checks, but was never invited inside the hilltop
home. Instead, the two always met in his client's garage, he said.
   ```He wasn't incompetent and certainly wasn't mentally
impaired,'' Thompson said. ``He didn't want to be bothered. He
didn't want to do things and just generally didn't care.''

   Nancy Cruzan's family gave her ``the gift of
freedom'' by disconnecting her feeding tube and allowing her to die
after nearly eight years in a vegetative state, her father said
Friday at her funeral.
   ``It was time,'' Joe Cruzan told about 200 people gathered at a
chapel. ``We all feel good that Nancy is free at last.''
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, died Wednesday at Missouri Rehabilitation Center
in Mount Vernon, 12 days after her family won court permission to
disconnect the feeding tube that kept her alive.
   ``She did not die in vain,'' her father said.
   The family's legal efforts to end her life led to a landmark
Supreme Court decision June 25 that patients like Ms. Cruzan could
be allowed to die if there was ``clear and convincing'' evidence
that was their wish.
   Ms. Cruzan had been in a persistent vegetative state after
suffering severe brain damage in a 1983 car accident. Her parents
and former co-workers said it was her desire to die rather than
live in such a state.
   Ms. Cruzan's father said requests for living wills, which allow
adults to decide whether they want to be kept alive by artificial
means, increased 500-fold since her case got national attention.
   ``I believe that these facts alone speak to the legacy that
Nancy left us,'' he said.
   Ms. Cruzan was buried in Carterville, just north of her
southwest Missouri hometown of Joplin.
   Her blue metal casket, adorned with drawings of flying sea
gulls, remained closed during the 45-minute service. Two dozen
floral arrangements surrounded the casket, including a single red
rose from her grandparents.
   Thirteen photographs of Ms. Cruzan were displayed above the
casket, including one of her as an infant bundled for winter play,
as a little girl wrestling with a too-tall bicycle and as a young,
dark-haired woman dressed in red with a beaming smile.
   ``Nancy seemed to be born with laughter in her spirit,'' said
the Rev. Bob Clyde, the Cruzans' minister.
   Tapes of Ms. Cruzan's favorite songs were played in the chapel,
including ``The Rose'' by Bette Midler and ``Coming Home'' by Bob
Seger.
   Demonstrators picketed and camped outside the hospital while Ms.
Cruzan was dying and unsuccessfully pleaded with Missouri and
federal courts to order her feeding tube reconnected.
   ``To the ones who maybe didn't understand or didn't agree, we
did what we felt we had to do,'' Cruzan told reporters. ``We
appreciate their prayers.''
   After a crush of mourners left Ms. Cruzan's grave, her father
returned, stood quietly for a moment, then placed a single pink
flower on the casket before wiping his eyes.
   ``Nancy's free at last ... thank God,'' he said.

<HEAD>Justice to Challenge Hawaii Combination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Friday it had
filed a civil antitrust suit aimed at blocking the planned merger
of two banks in Hawaii.
   The banks are First Interstate and First Hawaiian. First
Hawaiian planned to buy all the shares of First Interstate on
Monday for $140 million.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Honolulu, charged that
the consolidation would have excessive market power in business
banking services in Hawaii to an extent forbidden by the Clayton
Act.
   The department said First Interstate is the fourth largest bank
in Hawaii with $771 million in deposits, or 5.6 percent of the
Hawaii total, while First Hawaiian is the second largest, with
deposits of $5 billion or about 32 percent of the total.
   James F. Rill, assistant attorney general in charge of the
antitrust division, said in a statement: ``This acquisition will
hurt the many small to medium-sized businesses in Hawaii. The
acquisition will eliminate one of only a few banks serving those
customers and will likely result in them paying higher prices for
services.''
   Walter Dods, president of First Hawaiian, said in Honolulu the
department had nine months to make its objections known, but waited
until the last possible day to go to court.
   Asked if the merger was an antitrust violation, he said it was
not. ``We have very strong opinions and our lawyers agree and
that's why the Federal Reserve Board approved the deal.''
   He said it was ``highly likely'' the bank would contest the
department's suit.

<TEXT>
   The singer who provided the voice of
Cinderella in the animated film has filed a $20 million lawsuit
claiming that Disney violated her contract by producing
videocassettes of the classic.
   Ilene Woods Shaughnessy, who in 1948 was paid $2,500, said in
the suit that her contract forbids Disney from making copies of the
movie for sale to the public.
   ``In 1988, defendant Disney commenced production and marketing
for sale to the public videocassette versions of `Cinderella,' all
of which has been done without plaintiff's consent,'' the suit
said.
   Steve Feldstein, a spokesman for the home video division of
Disney, said the company had not seen the suit and had no comment.
   Shaughnessy, who lives in Woodland Hills, was 22 when she
provided the voice of Cinderella, said Dave Smith, archivist for
Walt Disney Productions.
   Walt Disney liked her clear delivery when he heard her sing for
the movie's composers, according to company records kept by Smith.
   She performed such songs as ``So This is Love'' and ``A Dream is
a Wish Your Heart Makes'' for the movie, he said.
   Shaughnessy also sang on radio programs, including ``The Bing
Crosby Show'' and ``The Paul Whiteman Show,'' Smith said.
   The suit is similar to at least two others brought against
Disney.
   Singer Peggy Lee won a summary judgment in April against Disney
in a suit in which she claimed the company needed her approval
before releasing the videocassette version of ``Lady and the
Tramp.''
   Lee provided voices and co-wrote songs for the 1955 animated
film.
   Singer Mary Costa, the voice of the princess in the 1959 movie
``Sleeping Beauty,'' filed a suit in May 1989 seeking royalties
related to videocassette sales.
   Shaughnessy asks for $10 million in damages for breach of
contract and at least $10 million more for her contribution to the
success of the videocassette.
   Feldstein said he didn't know how many videocassettes of the
movie have been sold.

   An explosion Friday that may have been triggered
by work on a gas line blew the doors off apartments on the top
floor of a 14-story housing project and started a fire, officials
said.
   The fire in Brooklyn was brought under control in about 1{
hours, said fire department spokesman Adam Krause.
   ``On the 14th floor all the doors were blown off and four
apartments were demolished,'' said police spokesman Fred Weiner.
``Damage was also done to the 12th and 13th floors.''
   The top floor of the Albany Housing Project in the Crown Heights
section collapsed and flames shot out windows at the height of the
blaze.
   Nine adults and three children were seriously injured and two
firefighters were treated at the scene, Weiner said.
   Under investigation was the possibility that the fire was
triggered by a gas explosion, Krause said.
   ``There was some contracting work being done on a gas line in
apartment 14J,'' said Robert Murphy, a spokesman for Brooklyn Union
Gas.
   The utility supplies gas for heating and cooking to the
building, but the Housing Authority is responsible for maintaining
lines.
   One person was admitted to the Cornell Medical Center Burn Unit
and the other injured were treated at local hospitals.

devaluation. Picks up 6th graf, `Markovic said...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced a deep
devaluation of the currency on Friday as part of a package of
economic reforms that it urged Parliament to pass to keep the
fractious federation from falling apart.
   Premier Ante Markovic announced the measures in an address to
both chambers of the federal parliament. He said Yugoslavia's
survival depended on the successful redirection of the nation's
economy along free-market lines.
   ``We are at a crucial juncture. Shall we permit this country to
be faced with inevitable violence or will we ensure a peaceful,
legal and democratic solution to the crisis by continuing our
reforms?'' he asked.
   Markovic asked for a wage freeze in most sectors to help keep
inflation down, and for ceilings on public spending by the
federation and Yugoslavia's six republics.
   Under the devaluation, the dinar's value against the German mark
would fall 22 percent, from seven dinars to the mark to nine. The
dollar would be worth 13.5 dinars after the devaluation.
   Markovic said the International Monetary Fund had approved his
program and IMF officials had assured him they stood ready to
approve a $1 billion standby agreement for Yugoslavia in January.
   Yugoslavia could lose access to Western credit if it doesn't
stick to his program, he said.
   Since coming to power almost two years ago, Markovic has slowed
inflation, which hit 2,500 percent in 1989, and introduced major
pro-capitalist reforms.
   Inflation has crept up again to an estimated 120 percent annual
rate, but Markovic predicted it would drop to 40 percent in 1991.
   The economy was hit hard by loss of $1.3 billion in contracts
due to the Persian Gulf crisis, and $1.7 billion from a long
drought, Markovic said.
   But Yugoslavia succeeded this year in repaying $3.8 billion of
its hard currency-denominated foreign debt, which now stands at
$16.5 billion.
   The governments of Yugoslavia's six republics - whose members
range from former Communists to free-market conservatives - have
hurt the country's economy by expanding public spending and
granting pay raises in state-run companies, Markovic said.
   Each republic has wide control over its own economic and
financial policies under Yugoslavia's federal system, and the
central government often cannot intervene.
   Center-right or nationalist parties triumphed in elections this
year in four republics. Communists remained in power in Serbia and
Montenegro.
   Slovenia and Croatia want the patchwork federation of often
hostile ethnic groups transformed into a loose association of
independent states. Serbia favors keeping power centralized in
Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital.
   Serbia imposed 50 percent taxes on goods from Slovenia and
Croatia this year, torpedoing Markovic's plans to keep a unified
internal Yugoslav market.
   The Serbian government opposes his plans for privatization and
other market reforms and has launched a media campaign demanding
the premier resign.
   The eight-member federal presidency met with all six state
presidents Thursday and Friday for negotiations aimed at concerting
the country's future.

<TEXT>
   A small band of leftist rebels signed a
peace treaty with the government Friday and pledged to throw its
weapons into the Caribbean Sea.
   The agreement represents another important step in the
government's effort to disarm a variety of guerrilla groups behind
a three-decade-old insurgency. The peace accord is the second to be
signed with Colombian guerrillas this year.
   The new agreement, which ended eight years of fighting, was
signed by government officials and rebels of the Revolutionary
Workers' Party, know by its Spanish acronym, PRT, presidential
press spokeswoman Amparo Trujillo told The Associated Press.
   The document was signed in the northern Colombian town of Don
Gabriel, where PRT guerrillas assembled after declaring a
cease-fire and entering peace talks with the government on Oct. 23.
   Under the accord, the Revolutionary Workers' estimated 100
rebels will throw their weapons into the Caribbean and join the
political process within a month, officials said.
   A more extensive accord with additional details on the
guerrillas' demobilization will be signed in January, Trujillo
said.
   During the past eight years, the Revolutionary Workers have
fought the army and police in the northern coastal province of
Sucre.
   In March, the much larger M-19 rebel group signed a treaty with
the government in exchange for amnesty.
   The M-19's success in transforming itself into an influential
political party has been seen as key in convincing other rebel
groups to give up armed struggle.
   Two other groups are reported near an agreement with government,
although the country's major guerrilla movement has kept on
fighting.
   Two other guerrilla outfits, the Maoist-inspired Peoples'
Liberation Army and Quintin Lame, a small but fierce band of
indigenous rebels, are expected to sign treaties within weeks.
   However, Colombia's oldest and biggest rebel group, the Armed
Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, is still fighting the army in the
countryside. About 160 troops and guerrillas have died this month
in fighting.

   From Michigan, Diane L. Spencer wrote to Pennsylvania
authorities to protest the exhumation of her daughter, Joyce A.
Donochick, who died at age 6 weeks.
   Parts of the letter were read aloud in court Thursday, but
Clearfield County Judge John Reilly Jr. ruled Joyce's body should
be examined by forensic pathologists.
   Spencer is held in the Allegan County Jail in Michigan, where
she is charged with first-degree murder in the September death of
her 6-month-old son, Aaron A. Spencer.
   Another of her children, Autumn Dawn Spencer, died in 1987 at 17
days old.
   Dan Miller, police chief in Wayland, said Ms. Spencer confessed
to suffocating all three children. Authorities had believed they
died of sudden infant death syndrome.
   Clearfield County Coroner R. Joel Heath said Joyce's body would
be exhumed within two weeks.
   Pennsylvania authorities have not filed charges in the deaths of
the two girls.

   A double-barreled blast of winter Friday hit the Pacific
Northwest and the East, knocking out power to thousands, disrupting
flights, delaying or detouring commuters and bringing more worries
to farmers.
   Hundreds of fender-benders - and numerous traffic accidents -
were reported in the East as motorists adjusted to snow for the
first time this winter.
   ``The first storm is always a little confusing. It takes
everyone a little bit of time to get acclimated,'' observed William
F. Palmer, operations manager of the airport in Windsor Locks,
Conn.
   The storm led to one person's death in New York City when smoke
filled a subway tunnel after melting snow shorted out electrical
cables. About 150 subway passengers were injured when smoke spread
through the East River tunnel connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.
   At least three deaths in Connecticut were described by
authorities Friday as weather-related. Two men over age 60 suffered
fatal heart attacks while shoveling snow, and a 17-year-old died
when the car he was traveling in slid off the road and overturned.
   In Ohio, a 7-year-old Springfield boy died Friday when a mound
of snow fell on him as he played with a friend. In Washington
state, a 47-year-old Vashon Island woman was killed when a tree
fell on the car she was in.
   Cold and stormy weather have been blamed for about 90 deaths
nationwide since Dec. 18.
   Seven inches of wet snow fell in New York City's Central Park
just a few days after temperatures in the 60s made the record
books.
   In the Northwest, the brunt of the storm that arrived late
Thursday for the most part bypassed Seattle and other major cities
in western Washington. But chilling winds whipped the region from
the Canadian border south to Puget Sound.
   Utilities reported about 94,000 customers in Washington state
were without power by late Friday after winds knocked trees and
branches onto power lines.
   In California, temperatures plunging into the teens and 20s have
wiped out 80 percent of the navel orange crop for a loss of nearly
$288 million in farming revenues, the state Department of Food and
Agriculture reported. Navel oranges make up about half of the
state's total orange crop.
   ``People in the industry say they've never seen anything like
this,'' said Tom McNair, agricultural statistician for the
California Agricultural Statistics Service. ``In future years,
freezes will be compared to this one. They will say, `It's not as
bad as 1990.'''
   And things could get worse before they get better: Another
crop-killing freeze was expected overnight.
   In New Mexico, snow covered Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Los Alamos
and Gallup.
   The National Weather Service said 3 inches of snow fell Friday
in Albuquerque's far Northeast Heights, and 1 to 2 inches at the
airport.
   In the East, New York City's three regional airports reported
delays of 45 minutes to an hour.
   And New York's Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter
Railroad reported scattered weather-related train delays and
cancellations.
   Virtually all of Pennsylvania was blanketed with snow overnight.
The south-central mountain counties got 10 to 16 inches.
   In Wilson borough, near Allentown, 30 families were forced to
evacuate their homes after a snowplow ruptured a gas line. They
were allowed to return after the minor leak was repaired.
   Martinsburg, W.Va., was buried under at least 10 inches of snow
and freezing rain turned West Virginia's highways into skating
rinks, authorities said.
   ``We don't have any roads shut down per se. But they're bad,
real bad,'' Berkeley County emergency services dispatcher Robin
Taylor said. ``They're just full of snow.''
   ``The cars are all over the place. They're a mess.''
   On Friday, rescuers in Hedgesville, W.Va., again searched for
two boys missing since their car plunged off a bridge into a creek
Wednesday. Four family members died in the accident.
   Dense fog in much of Indiana created dangerous driving
conditions for motorists Friday, a day after up to 10 inches of
snow fell in parts of the state.
   Some welcomed the wintry conditions.
   In particular, ski resort operators found the snow to be a
belated Christmas gift.
   At Vernon Valley-Great Gorge ski area in northwestern New
Jersey, four extra staffers were called in to sell tickets, said
Lori Vovchansky, who works the courtesy desk there.
   ``Business is very busy today,'' she said. ``We've had a lot of
calls this morning. The switchboard is going off the wall.''

   Bob Hope, who only seems to
have been visiting the troops at Christmas since the Civil War, on
Friday night pronounced morale of American forces in Saudi Arabia
``just sensational.''
   The 87-year-old entertainer told reporters on his return from
Saudi Arabia: ``My opening line in the last week has been, `Are you
ready?'
   ``And man, they all stood up with a fist and said, `We're
ready.'''
   Hope was asked how morale of today's forces compared with those
he entertained in the Vietnam war. ``They know more what they're
doing,'' he replied.
   Hope's Christmas appearances, in the past noted for scantily
clad young women and off-color jokes, were drastically toned down
this year for fear of offending the strict Saudi hosts.
   Except for his wife, Dolores, women on the tour were based in
Bahrain and appeared only on U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf.
Reporters were not permitted to attend the shows.
   Appearances from camps in Saudi Arabia and from the ships will
be spliced together in a single television special next month.
   Hope's first overseas tour was in World War II, almost 50 years
ago, and he recalled servicemen in 1983 telling him their
grandfathers had seen him. He added, ``So if anybody tells you I
was in the Civil War, I'm denying that.''
   Hope has said recent trips, such as his 1989 Christmas
appearances in Europe, were his last. He repeated that again Friday
night: ``Honest, this is my last trip.''

   An ultra-Orthodox rabbi considered to be a
political kingmaker has enraged religious and secular Israelis by
claiming the Holocaust was God's punishment for sins such as
violating the Jewish Sabbath and eating pork.
   ``Not for a long time has any single remark caused such an
emotional reaction,'' said Razi Barkai, host of a radio talk show
that was flooded with hundreds of calls Thursday over the remarks
of Rabbi Eliezer Schach.
   Barkai said calls ran about 3-2 against the 97-year-old rabbi,
who also predicted another disaster may befall Jews for violating
traditional religious tenets.
   ``The last time he brought destruction, it was the Holocaust ...
Because of the sins, the Almighty may bring another Holocaust upon
us, and it may already be tomorrow,'' Schach told Jewish seminary
students earlier this week.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Navel orange prices could double nationwide
because of the deep freeze that devastated much of California's
citrus crop, an industry official says.
   Farmers, meanwhile, braced for a second arctic blast that
threatened to destroy surviving crops and the trees themselves.
   The navel orange crop in the San Joaquin Valley, the state's
main growing region, was virtually wiped out in the siege of
freezing temperatures that started Dec. 21.
   A number of vegetable crops were also damaged, including
artichokes, avocados, broccoli, cauliflower and celery. And the
cold affected the state's flower crop, forcing people working on
the Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena to use substitute
decorations.
   ``Prices could double because of the severe damage,'' said
Claire Peters, spokeswoman for Sunkist Growers Inc., a marketing
cooperative of about 6,000 California and Arizona growers.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The ink was barely dry on the first official
1990 census results when the numbers came under attack from state
and local officials fearful of losing political clout and federal
dollars.
   ``I think this thing was destined to fail from day one,'' said
Mayor Jimmy Kemp of Meridian, Miss., a longtime critic of how the
headcount was run. He was far from the only mayor to complain that
the census overlooks many of the nation's poor living in big
cities.
   The census numbers determine how many representatives each state
sends to Congress and how many federal aid dollars states and
localities receive.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, president of the National
League of Cities, said the numbers seemed ``to confirm the fears of
many city officials that significant numbers of people in their
communities were uncounted.''
   Michael Darby, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs,
said Thursday he was confident the count was ``full, fair and
accurate.'' He said an analysis due next summer is designed to
check the accuracy.

   OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - Subscribers to a nationwide computer
network contend the owners are taking a byte out of the First
Amendment by censoring the network's electronic bulletin board
messages.
   But officials for the Prodigy network, which provides consumer
and information services to several hundred thousand subscribers,
maintain they have the same right as newspaper and broadcast
executives to ``set boundaries'' on the exercise of free
expression.
   An electronic communications law expert agreed, saying the
challenge for Prodigy is enforcing standards tough enough to avoid
lawsuits sparked by bulletin board content.
   ``They should be able to forbid ... whatever they forbade in
their subscriber agreement,'' Dallas attorney Benjamin Wright said
Thursday.

   It is nice to be 82 and still a working
journalist. But Alistair Cooke, who is both, reports one problem
when young reporters arrive to interview him:
   ``I am at the stage where I ask, `Does the name Adolf Hitler
mean anything to you?'''
   Despite this gentle reminder that those who forget history are
doomed to see it repeated on cable, Cooke has prevailed in
broadcasting and will take due note of it early in the new year -
on Jan. 13, to be precise.
   He'll celebrate his 20th anniversary then as host of PBS'
``Masterpiece Theatre,'' commencing a nine-week retrospective of
some of its better-known dramatic bundles from Britain. But of
course they include ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' ``I, Claudius,'' and
``The Jewel in the Crown.''
   If that's not enough, PBS will offer a Jan. 24 parody of the
series, ``Masterpiece Tonight,'' concocted by Gerard Alessandrini,
whose ``Forbidden Broadway'' here regularly applies the needle to
Broadway musicals.
   A transplanted Englishman who gives urbane a good name, Cooke
has been the only host of ``Masterpiece Theatre'' since it began on
Jan. 10, 1971 with ``The First Churchills'' - one of his
least-favorite shows, incidentally.
   An elegant man, he favors blue blazers, gray slacks, and the
graceful turn of phrase. Also jazz piano.
   Born in Manchester, and a U.S. citizen since 1941, he first came
here as a student in 1932. He returned as a man of print and
broadcast who since 1938 has tried to explain America to the
British, no mean feat.
   In 1970, he embarked upon an even more difficult feat -
explaining America to the Americans - in his acclaimed ``America''
series, a BBC co-production that NBC aired in prime time in
1972-73. The show won four Emmies.
   But it also almost prevented him from signing up for
``Masterpiece Theatre.'' He was in Boston, filming the third
``America'' episode, when accosted by a young British producer,
Christopher Sarson.
   The ``Masterpiece'' idea - hosting a weekly series of British
dramas adapted from famous novels - was explained. Cooke begged
off, saying he'd be tied up on ``America'' for two years and
constantly travelling.
   But Sarson ``was a deadpan scoundrel - and terrifically
persuasive,'' he said.
   A veteran America-watcher whose dossier of pals and influences
includes H.L. Mencken, Cooke will celebrate another milestone in
March.
   That will be his 45th anniversary of commenting on his adopted
country's wild and sometimes disturbing ways in ``Letter From
America,'' a 14-minute weekly report he delivers on radio for the
BBC.
   Heard via short-wave in 52 countries, including this one, he
likens what he calls ``my talks'' to ``a diary, in a way, written
for a friend.''
   He comments on whatever strikes his fancy, sad or funny, minute
or of great import and consequence (he does admit, gently laughing,
that he has yet to give the once-over to Madonna and her amazing
mondo video).
   It's his proud semiboast that in all the years of ``Letter'' he
hasn't missed a week, although ``we came damn close a few months
ago'' when he had to go to a hospital here for a prostate
operation.
   Arrangements were made for him to tape that week's show in the
hospital's boardroom. They rolled him there in a wheelchair,
accompanied by two public relations officials, ``both stunning,''
from the hospital.
   He recalls telling them, ``What a pity we didn't have a
photographer with us. It's the first time in 44 years that I've
broadcast with a catheter bag.''
   As befits a man of his years and travels, he occasionally is
asked to compare the America of, say, 1940, with the America of
today. Given the chance to go cosmic, he instead offers a
refreshing, unexpected answer.
   ``I couldn't do it,'' he says. ``The standard thing is to talk
about the loss of innocence. Every generation thinks it was
innocent when it was young. It wasn't innocent. It was young.''
   He smiles when asked when, if ever, he'll sign off the air and
retire.
   ``Oh, it may happen tomorrow. I live from day to day, and it's
not for me to decide that. But I don't have any intention of doing
that. I think when you retire, you keel over.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT, IT'S FOR A DARN GOOD REASON:
The usual New Year's shows are loose on the networks starting at
11:30 p.m. EST tonight. CBS has ``Happy New Year America, 1991,''
hosted by Melissa Manchester and featuring Terry Bradshaw in Times
Square. That's where NBC's Jane Pauley also will be as part of a
live ``Tonight'' guest-hosted by Jay Leno. Yet another star, Dick
Clark, is checking in from Times Square for ``Dick Clark's New
Year's Rockin' Eve '91.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE: One of the most popular working actresses today
is a 19-year-old named after a Minnesota town: Wynona Ryder. She
has appeared in three movies this year: ``Edward Scissorhands,''
``Mermaids'' and ``Welcome Home, Roxie Carmichael.'' She is engaged
to actor Johnny Depp, her co-star in ``Edwawrd Scissorhands.''

   Winona Ryder laughed, as she started to drink a
well-earned cup of coffee. ``It's all kind of meshed together but
it's all very clear,'' she says, sounding a lot like her godfather,
Timothy Leary.
   The world's most exhausted 19-year-old makes herself comfortable
on the couch of her hotel suite, sitting Indian style and letting
her hands hang over her legs.Ryder's face is small, almost elfin,
with pale skin, pouty lips and eyes that stand out like dark brown
dots.
   Few people can look back on a year and say they starred in three
films and got engaged to actor Johnny Depp. Friends, family and
lots of caffeine have been the secrets, helping her through a time
highlighted by the movies she made (``Mermaids'' and ``Edward
Scissorhands''), one she didn't make (``The Godfather, Part III)''
and a tattoo on Depp's right arm that reads ``Winona Forever.''
   ``When I started out working I made a point of doing one movie a
year,'' Ryder said. ``I was going to have a lot of free time, but
all of a sudden, I fell into these movies that I wanted to do. I
went from one character to another without having time to think
about it. You kind of lose identity.
   ``It's important to surround yourself with people who have the
best intentions for you and want the best things for you. I have a
family who are my best friends in the world. I have two other close
friends and I have a boyfriend who is great.''
   Hard as she tries for a normal life, without maids and servants
and limousines, most people her age don't have careers, don't own
homes and don't dodge photographers.
   But her great appeal as an actress is how easy she is to relate
to, the look of permanent adolescent boredom in ``Beetlejuice'' or
the mixture of fear and desire as she comes to terms with sexuality
in ``Great Balls of Fire'' and ``Mermaids.''
   Actors seek a childlike frame of mind, an openness to emotions
that allows them to react spontaneously. It's easier for Ryder; she
has fewer years to lose.
   ``I love movies about children, like `To Kill a Mockingbird.' I
loved it because it was told in this voice of innocence, of purity.
It was so incredibly powerful to me because of that. It wasn't just
an adult trying to write in the eyes of a child. I liked `My Life
as a Dog' for the same reason.
   ``Most of the fan mail I receive is thanking me for `Heathers,'
'' Ryder says of the hit black comedy about the gruesome revenge of
teen outsiders. ``I think `Heathers' was the first movie that
didn't completely patronize teen-agers. I think they were sick of
what John Hughes was cramming down their throats.''
   ``Heathers'' is her favorite film, but Ryder also loved ``Edward
Scissorhands,'' the romantic fable directed by close friend Tom
Burton, and ``Mermaids,'' the quirky comedy co-starring Cher and
Bob Hoskins.
   More disappointing was ``Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael,'' a
critical and commercial flop that Ryder insists was ``turned into
something I couldn't relate to,'' and ``The Godfather, Part III,''
which the overworked actress dropped out of because of exhaustion.
Her role of Michael Corleone's daughter went to Sofia Coppola, who
has been panned by critics.
   ``I don't regret doing any movie I have ever done,'' she says.
``Whether or not it was any good or not I got something out of it.
From `Roxy Carmichael' I made a really good friend. Also I learn
things, standing up for yourself, lessons in terms of direction.''
   Ryder's first name came from a town in her home state of
Minnesota. She grew up in San Francisco and enjoyed a world of
bohemian poets, communes and old movies.
   Her father owns a bookstore and served as archivist to Leary,
the merry LSD guru of the 1960s. Her mother makes educational
films. Ryder took up acting.
   ``I started at 10 or 11,'' she said. ``I went to a theater
school (American Conservatory Theater) in San Francisco and I was
just taking classes there. It was something I was doing as a hobby
because I was having trouble in regular school. I couldn't make any
friends so I thought I could meet people more like me.''
   Early roles included ``Lucas,'' ``1969'' and ``Square Dance.''
In ``Beetlejuice,'' she played the most alienated of teen-agers,
decked out in black robes pulled from the actress' own closet, and
was the child bride of Dennis Quaid in ``Great Balls of Fire,''
based on the life of rock 'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis.
   Ryder swears ``Edward Scissorhands'' represents her graduation
from high school films and she is scheduled to appear as a taxi
driver in a new movie by ``Mystery Train'' director Jim Jarmusch.

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Johnny Depp, a forgotten young TV star largely
unknown by the movie-going public, has found new popularity thanks
to his title role in ``Edward Scissorhands.'' His co-star is also
his fiance, actress Winona Ryder.

   Once dismissed as a television star with a
teen following, Johnny Depp is earning new respect this season as
the cutlery-equipped creation of scientist Vincent Price in
``Edward Scissorhands.''
   With his weapon-like hands and scarred, pallid face, Depp has
been drawing critical praise for his haunting portrayal in Tim
Burton's hit fantasy. It's a far cry from the undercover cop Tom
Hanson he played during four seasons of the Fox network's ``21 Jump
Street.''
   The real Johnny Depp is a handsome 27-year-old with a faint
stubble of black beard and spiky hair reminiscent of Edward's. He
recalls being overwhelmed upon reading the ``Edward Scissorhands''
script by Caroline Thompson.
   ``I had a feeling about the story and the character that I can't
describe,'' he recalled. ``I knew I had to do it.
   ``I started thinking about the character right away. I kept
thinking of the faces of dogs I had owned. The eyes of new-born
babies. Pinocchio. All the great classics like `The Hunchback of
Notre Dame' started coming to me, and they all compiled in this big
mass.
   ``When I first met with Tim, we talked for two or three hours -
me and Tim and Denise Di Novi, the producer. I think we had similar
images of the character. I saw Tim's drawings, and everything just
clicked.''
   Burton, a former animator for the Walt Disney Co., brought his
unique vision to ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' ``Beetlejuice'' and
``Batman.'' His drawings helped convey the physical appearance of
Edward, but Depp had to build a character out of someone who had no
past: He was simply an (unfinished) creation of Vincent Price.
   ``I kept thinking of a dog,'' Depp theorized. ``Dogs have that
unconditional love. If you scold a dog, he cowers in a corner. As
soon as you call him back, he's there, and all is forgotten.
   ``A lot of the things that Tim and I talked about was just to
maintain the purity of the character. Edward has lived in the attic
of this mansion for seven years, and when he comes into suburbia,
everything was beautiful and fascinating to him.
   ``I got the (scissor) hands a few months before we started
shooting. I just tried to function normally with these long shears.
Normal things like working remote control on the television set
were just impossible. Trying to work the TV set manually or turn on
the cassette player was tough. Going to the bathroom is something I
don't want to talk about.
   ``I went to sleep with the hands on. Woke up and one of them had
been thrown across the room. I nicked myself a few times. After a
while it became second nature.
   ``Because Edward doesn't say a lot, I knew early on that (the
character) would rely on gestures. When I was finally put into the
costume and bound up, that escalated the ideas I had. The feeling
of being bound up and completely restricted, not able to move with
full capacity. The wardrobe, the hands and the costume helped a
lot.''
   Depp's love interest in ``Edward Scissorhands'' is Winona Ryder,
his off-screen sweetheart. ``We had been together for six months
before we started the movie,'' he said. ``It was kind of a lucky
coincidence. She had already been attached to the project. Then I
read it and thought that Tim would never want me. I was pleasantly
surprised when he did.''
   Johnny Depp was born in Owenboro, Ky., and moved to Miramar,
Fla., when he was 6. He came to Hollywood in 1983, intending to be
a rock musician. A friend introduced him to an agent, and Depp was
cast in ``A Nightmare on Elm Street.'' He played one of the
soldiers in ``Platoon,'' then began his four-year, sometimes stormy
association with ``21 Jump Street.''
   ``There's nothing bad I can say about the series,'' he said.
``On one level it definitely put me on the map. There's not a
better way to learn than to just do it every day on camera, five
days a week.
   ``I've had no trouble with being typed. When you meet me, you
realize I'm an entirely different person from the character I
played on television.''

   The candidates all have appeared, and now the
movie world looks forward to a shootout between a Western pioneer
and two bands of modern-day gangsters for the Academy Awards.
   Will Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' be the winner?
Consensus thinking favors the epic of a cavalry officer who is
adopted by an Indian tribe. Hollywood admires Costner's courage to
fight for his film against heavy odds: Westerns are out of fashion,
one-third of the dialogue is subtitled, the film runs three hours.
   However, strong competition comes from ``GoodFellas,'' which
traces the rise and fall of a Brooklyn wiseguy. The Martin Scorsese
drama has been scoring with critics' circles awards in New York and
Los Angeles, less so with the ticket-buying public. After 98 days
in release, ``GoodFellas'' has collected a respectable but
unsensational $40 million.
   Paramount Picture's Christmas gift to Corleone fans, ``The
Godfather Part III,'' may also prove a strong contender. A victory
as best picture would provide an unbreakable record; the first two
``Godfathers'' won Hollywood's top prize.
   But more recent history seems to favor ``Dances With Wolves'' to
win as best picture of 1990. Academy voters have opted for
broadscale movies of courage and adventure: ``Ghandi,'' ``Chariots
of Fire,'' ``Out of Africa,'' ``Platoon,'' ``The Last Emperor.''
   Money alone doesn't sway the voters. There is little chance for
important awards for the $100 million-plus moneymakers of the year:
``The Hunt for Red October,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Pretty
Woman,'' ``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total Recall,'' ``Home Alone,'' not to
mention ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   Here's how the nominees for the 1990 Oscar race appear to this
observer:
   - Best Picture: ``Dances With Wolves,'' ``GoodFellas'' and ``The
Godfather Part III'' could be joined by a classic, ``Hamlet'' or
``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   Penny Marshall's ``Awakenings'' has a strong chance. On a more
frivolous note, ``Postcards From the Edge'' is a possibility.
Longshots include ``Avalon,'' ``The Grifters,'' ``The Sheltering
Sky,'' ``Reversal of Fortune.''
   - Best Actor: Kevin Costner's valiant Westerner seems a certain
nominee, along with Al Pacino's aging Michael Corleone of ``The
Godfather Part III.'' Robin Williams as the warm-hearted doctor in
``Awakenings'' and Jeremy Irons' cold-blooded Claus von Bulow of
``Reversal of Fortune'' also are likely. Robert De Niro could be
nominated for either ``GoodFellas'' or ``Awakenings.'' Longshots:
Danny Glover, ``To Sleep With Anger''; Gerard Depardieu, ``Cyrano
de Bergerac'' or ``Green Card''; Armin Mueller-Stahl, ``Avalon'';
Richard Harris, ``The Field''; Sean Connery, ``The Hunt for Red
October'' or ``The Russia House.''
   Best Actress: Two past winners figure strongly, Joanne Woodward
for ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' and Anjelica Huston for ``The
Grifters'' or ``Witches.'' Susan Sarandon also seems likely for
``White Palace.'' Kathy Bates of ``Misery'' could be nominated in
this category or as supporting actress. Others: Meryl Streep and
Shirley MacLaine, ``Postcards From the Edge''; Mia Farrow,
``Alice''; Julia Roberts, ``Pretty Woman''; Michelle Pfeiffer,
``The Russia House.''
   Best Supporting Actor: Joe Pesci, ``GoodFellas''; Bruce Davison,
``Longtime Companion''; Andy Garcia, ``The Godfather Part III'';
Marlon Brando, ``The Freshman''; Graham Greene, ``Dances With
Wolves''; Hector Elizondo, ``Pretty Woman''; Al Pacino, ``Dick
Tracy''; Alan Arkin, ``Edward Scissorhands.''
   Best Supporting Actress: Dianne Wiest, ``Edward Scissorhands'';
Whoopi Goldberg, ``Ghost'' or ``The Long Walk Home''; Mary
McDonnell, ``Dances With Wolves''; Diane Ladd, ``Wild at Heart'';
Lorraine Bracco, ``GoodFellas''; Joan Plowright, ``Avalon.''
   Best Director: Kevin Costner, ``Dances With Wolves''; Martin
Scorsese, ``GoodFellas''; Francis Ford Coppola, ``The Godfather
Part III''; Penny Marshall, ``Awakenings''; Mike Nichols,
``Postcards From the Edge''; Barbet Schroeder, ``Reversal of
Fortune''; Franco Zeffirelli, ``Hamlet''; Peter Weir, ``Green
Card.''
   The above hopefuls will be culled when the Academy Award
nominations are announced in pre-dawn ceremonies on Feb. 13 in
Beverly Hills. The awards will be presented on March 25 at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Taiwanese Rock Group Sings With a Rebellious Voice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rock group that sings in Taiwan's native
language has taken this island nation by storm, becoming the first
music group to criticize the Nationalist government in another sign
of Taiwan's increasing freedom.
   Blacklist, a trio of two Taiwanese and one American, mouths its
dissent with bold lyrics and a musical style that blends rock 'n'
roll with the exotic strains of traditional Chinese music.
   Nobody is safe from the band's sarcastic lyrics, which mock
pro-democracy protesters and conservative Nationalist politicians
alike. Even Taiwan's middle-class lifestyle comes in for a beating
in a song that goes: ``Heh, heh Taxi, where are you going?''
   One song called ``Democracy Bumpkin'' from the band's new LP
makes fun of both the government and demonstrators. The tune begins
with trumpets feebly playing Taiwan's national anthem. An electric
guitar cuts in.
   The groups sings: ``I stroll in downtown Taipei - Riot police
block the street ... Suddenly my heart feels a chill - Tell me
please, Mr. Policeman - Are we preparing a war to regain mainland
China?''
   As the music blares, shouts of ``I want to protest'' fill the
air - a reflection of the pent-up frustration in Taiwan's highly
regulated society.
   The song criticizes elderly lawmakers who have occupied about
half of the seats in the legislature since 1949, when the
Nationalist government lost a war to communist forces on mainland
China and fled to Taiwan. The legislators have been frozen in
office to support the Nationalists' claim to represent all China.
   ``They are so old that they can hardly breathe - The government
fears they may die anytime - So our tax money pays for their
intravenous drips,'' the song goes.
   Government censors tolerated the band's first album, ``Songs of
Madness,'' released in November 1989. But Taiwan's
government-controlled radio and television stations have never
broadcast their tunes. The unofficial ban has hurt the band.
   Nevertheless, the album has so far sold more than 100,000 copies
to students and intellectuals, an impressive figure for the group.
   ``These are Taiwan's most rebellious songs in 40 years. They are
candid eyewitnesses of our time,'' said Jack Liu, chief editor of
the Audio Art monthly.
   Joe Wang, founder of the Blacklist, does not seem to worry about
the broadcast ban.
   ``We know some Nationalist authorities hate these songs. But we
have to send out the message that people here are not happy with
Taiwan's politics and society,'' he said in a recent interview at
Blacklist's studio.
   ``It is encouraging that our album is still well-received,''
added Keith Stuart, studio engineer of the group. ``It means this
society is open enough to accept new concepts.''
   Wang, 36, formed the Blacklist two years ago with friend Io
Chen, a 29-year-old cellist. They were joined by Stuart, 34, of
Little Rock, Ark., who specializes in synthesizing and composition.
   Taiwan has undergone great change since 1987 when the government
ended the 38 years of martial law that had cemented the
Nationalists in power. Opposition parties were legalized shortly
thereafter, restrictions on the press were relaxed and free
elections were held.
   Still, large-scale resentment continues.
   While most artists here refrain from offending authorities,
Blacklist participated in Taiwan's largest student protest in March
to demand that the elderly lawmakers step down.
   During the week-long sit-in at a Taipei park, thousands of
college students, outraged by the government's slow pace of
political reforms, sang aloud, ``We won't wait any more,'' an
impromptu song dedicated to the protesters by Blacklist.
   The government later agreed to retire all the aging lawmakers,
mostly in their 80s or older, by the end of 1991.
   ``Those old deputies are the most ridiculous phenomenon in the
world,'' Wang said. ``But they are not to blame. The Nationalists
made them absurd.''
   Another thing that makes the group unique in Taiwan is their use
of the local Taiwanese dialect, instead of official Mandarin
Chinese.
   When the Nationalists took power in Taiwan, they imposed the
culture of the mainland on this island. Taiwanese comprise of about
85 percent of Taiwan's population of 20 million, but Mandarin
Chinese replaced the Taiwanese dialect in the classroom and
students were penalized if they spoke the local patois.
   Wang, a native Taiwanese, started writing songs in Taiwanese
about five years ago when his grandmother complained she could not
understand him over the telephone.
   ``I didn't know I was a Taiwanese when I was young. I even took
pride in my fluent Mandarin,'' he said.
   The band has met with much critical acclaim even from
intellectuals.
   ``The music is very good with its originality,'' said Hsiao Yeh,
a prominent writer. ``The songs grow from this land and show their
concerns for the people.''
   Wang might disagree.
   ``In some ways,'' he said, ``we are aliens in Taiwan's pop
music.''

<HEAD>Foxy Legacy: The Lingering Impact of Jimi Hendrix</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SPENCER BRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jimi Hendrix is dead and selling jeans in Britain.
   Still selling records, too, 20 years after his death; still
unmatched by all would-be imitators of his furious, blazing mastery
of the electric guitar.
   ``The Hendrix phenomenon has never really gone away,'' says
George McManus, marketing executive at Polydor Records.
   Two decades gone, Hendrix is a briskly moving product. Polydor's
``Cornerstones'' album hit the top five and will shortly go
platinum in Britain. Wrangler adopted ``Crosstown Traffic'' for a
jeans commercial.
   Bass player Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell, the
survivors of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, each published books this
year.
   ``Jimi's death was the most lucrative act of his sad career,''
according to Redding, whose book is partly a diatribe against the
Hendrix estate.
   The U.S. Army, which counts Hendrix as an alumnus, kicked off
the year by including his ``Voodoo Chile'' as part of its amplified
get-out-of-that-refuge concert in Panama for Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The anniversary may be a melancholy event for anyone who
remembers the first ear-boggling encounter with ``Foxy Lady,''
``Manic Depression'' or ``Purple Haze'' - ``'Scuse me, while I kiss
the sky'' - from the ``Are You Experienced?'' LP in 1967.
   Serious craziness was the Hendrix experience: a stoned banshee
swathed in psychedelic foppery, caressing and bullying and
battering his guitar; bending ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' into
weird shapes at Woodstock; amazing the plaster casters; fleeing a
concert in Denver in a cloud of tear gas; taking too many downers
and choking to death on his own vomit.
   Born in Seattle in 1942, Hendrix found fame in Britain, and
Britain is where he died, in his London apartment on Sept. 18,
1970.
   His records have always sold well, but his impact wasn't widely
recognized until the Wrangler jeans company commissioned a survey
into British teen-age musical tastes. Hendrix's name ranked high
alongside living rock stars.
   Wrangler decided to feature Hendrix's ``Crosstown Traffic'' in
what became a highly effective TV commercial. Filmed in New York,
it showed a handsome young taxi driver who dumps his cab in the
middle of Manhattan and takes off to Miami. Wrangler followed up
with another commercial including footage of Hendrix in concert.
   ``His appeal is partly his rebel image and partly his short
life, the James Dean factor,'' Polydor's McManus said. ``But deeper
than that, I believe it is because he is the source of so much of
today's music. People like Bon Jovi and Def Leppard will readily
admit to the debt they owe him. You can hear 20 seconds of a guitar
and know it is Jimi Hendrix. Very few people had that ability.''
   One of the most successful new British bands to cite Hendrix as
an influence is The Stone Roses from the thriving Manchester scene,
whose ``indie dance'' music combines psychedelia with disco-derived
``house'' music.
   Hendrix's influence can be detected on their two recent Top 10
singles, ``One Love'' and ``Fools Gold''
   ``Hendrix is top for me,'' says Stone Roses guitarist John
Squire. ``He was trying to expand peoples' minds in the '60s and
we're trying to do the same thing for the '90s. He had an extrovert
approach which we share. He is one of the few people we can relate
to.''
   The two men most closely related to Hendrix have contrasting
stories to tell.
   Redding, who was sacked from the band, emphasizes financial
matters. His book, ``Are You Experienced?'' is about the millions
of dollars worth of royalties he claims to be owed.
   Mitchell's book, ``The Hendrix Experience,'' is full of pictures
and generally happier.
   Hendrix, according to Mitchell, ``was far from a tragic
character. For one thing, he had a wicked sense of humor. That's
why the women, in particular, really liked him, because we're
talking about a man who was funny.''
   One of Hendrix's secrets as a guitar technician, Mitchell
writes, were his thumbs, ``nearly as long as his fingers.''
   Mitchell also complains about his treatment by the estate, but
he had one lucrative gift from Hendrix: a Fender Stratocaster that
sold for $350,000 at auction in April.
   One important figure who has not written his memoirs is Chas
Chandler, former bass player of The Animals who saw Hendrix in a
Greenwich Village club, brought him to England and formed The Jimi
Hendrix Experience.
   ``I considered writing a book now and again, but I never had the
time, and anyway I enjoy books too much,'' Chandler said in a rare
interview.
   He has returned to his roots in a coastal village in the
northeast of England where he lives with his family and manages a
local rock outfit, The Steve Graham Band.
   Chandler produced the first two Hendrix albums, ``Are You
Experienced?'' and ``Axis: Bold as Love,'' but quit halfway through
``Electric Ladyland,'' frustrated with the hangers-on and endless
rerecording of tracks.
   ``My only obvious regret is I wonder if I didn't walk out maybe
he would still be alive. He is a loss; he was a good friend.
Otherwise, I certainly have no regrets,'' Chandler said.
   ``I do think there is a death cult around Jimi. There is
something black about all this brooding over his death. He is
typified as some sort of brooding genius. But when he was alive he
was a very funny guy, full of laughter. He was quite a gentle lad,
quiet but witty and a good mimic.
   ``You would have thought he went everywhere and burned his
guitar. But he only did it twice.''
   Chandler said that when he met him, Hendrix hadn't written a
song. ``But I knew there was a place in England for him through the
sheer potential of his guitar. The music audiences in England had
become quite sophisticated. ... The Beatles were pushing the
boundaries of what was acceptable and audiences were quite willing
to grasp something that was experimental.''
   Chandler also believes Hendrix's appeal endures because of his
imitators.
   ``Most of the riffs played by a lot of guitar bands have their
origins in Hendrix. He was an originator of sounds, the greatest
guitar player to have lived,'' Chandler said.

<HEAD>From Seedy to Thriving: Kansas City's River Quay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY STREFF BUZBEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In its brief heyday, it was a place
where people would go to browse for antiques or enjoy a night on
the town.
   But for the last 13 years, ever since a series of mob bombings
and gangland slayings closed taverns and scared customers away,
Kansas City's River Quay area has sat deserted.
   Transients slept beside empty buildings and an X-rated movie
theater. The only sign of a former era came on Saturday mornings,
when produce companies sold vegetables and fruit out of dilapidated
stalls.
   Now, with $40 million in public and private investment and a new
name, the city's River Market area hopes to draw people back with a
renovated produce market, upscale loft apartments, quaint
restaurants, shops and a riverboat museum.
   It's the kind of restoration that has led to a business and
economic surge for historic commercial areas in many cities, from
Boston's Faneuil Hall Marketplace to Fisherman's Wharf in San
Francisco.
   ``We're trying to create a neighborhood - to have people living
down here and shopping down here. And we're finally starting to
show some results,'' said Bette Guarino, president of a non-profit
group that struggled for years to find a private company to develop
the area.
   People with organized crime connections no longer own property
in the area, which lies just north of downtown and south of the
Missouri River, Ms. Guarino said. The mob can't move in this time
because of tighter city zoning controls, she said. Developers are
focusing on restaurants and apartments, not bars.
   But others say the River Quay's legacy lingers.
   ``When it's finished, it'll be the greatest thing that ever
happened to this city,'' said Mary Jane Orlando, the owner of Mama
Orlando's restaurant, one of the few eateries open in the area.
More are scheduled to open soon.
   ``But it's not finished yet,'' Mrs. Orlando said. ``People are
watching what's going on down here. They're aware of the progress,
but they're still scared.''
   Mrs. Orlando said she got a typical reaction during a recent
trip to a dentist in a northern Kansas City suburb.
   ``When I gave the address of my place of business, the
receptionist, who I'd never met, looked at me and said, `Aren't you
scared to be down there with the Mafia?'' Mrs. Orlando said. ``So a
lot of people are still thinking about that.''
   In the last year, the area has regained some of its former
charm. The private development company that bought many of the
area's old buildings has leased more than 70 loft apartments to
young professionals and couples, many of whom work downtown.
Another developer owns two buildings full of loft apartments where
poets hold public readings on weekend nights.
   The city has repaved streets and put in new lights, brick
sidewalks and trees. This spring, a museum housing a restored
paddlewheel from a riverboat that sank in 1856 is scheduled to
open.
   ``The physical renovation is going really great,'' said Brian
Collins, president of the Economic Development Corp. ``We have a
lot of hopes for it. In other cities, this kind of market area has
really sparked revivals.''
   The area evolved slowly from a stretch of river shorline into a
a business district and farmer's market. The brother of Tom
Pendergast, a famous political boss, once owned a tavern there. But
it was mostly warehouses by the time a local developer got the idea
to attract artists and restaurants in 1972.
   A year after the first shops and artists' lofts opened, 60
businesses were operating. But a surprisingly high number were
bars. As the area prospered, the mob mucled in, attempting to
transform it into a red-light district.
   Then arson fires started. The father of one bar owner who
resisted mob intimidation was found slain in a car trunk. Other
slayings followed. Artists moved away and customers stopped coming.
   ``There was a time when I had to defend this project everywhere
I went and everyone I talked to because of all that history,'' Ms.
Guarino said. ``I still run across that a little, but not nearly as
much. Now people want to know what's happening.''

<HEAD>Memory of Folk Singer Phil Ochs Kept Alive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With America facing the possibility of
another war and the unbound optimism of the 1980s becoming
threadbare, the late Phil Ochs' songs carry the same bite today as
they did two decades ago.
   And they're getting wider play again, at least in the East.
   Verses such as ``So young so strong so ready for the war, so
willing to go and die upon a foreign shore,'' from ``One More
Parade,'' could just as easily be a lament about soldiers marching
off to the Persian Gulf as Southeast Asia.
   And, ``If you can't afford your bill don't tell me that you're
ill, 'cause that's the free enterprise way,'' from the sarcastic
``AMA Song,'' rings a chord for people hit by the spiraling cost of
health care.
   Ochs - sounds like ``oaks'' - wrote those songs in the '60s,
when his gift for composing tuneful poison-pen letters to the
establishment placed him near the top of the heap of popular folk
singers.
   ``I think everybody in the field at the time felt he had a great
influence and was a great writer,'' said Dick Cerri, president of
the World Folk Music Association.
   ``As a songwriter ... he was second to only (Bob) Dylan in the
late '60s,'' said Ochs' brother and former manager, Michael Ochs.
   But when the peace and love spirit of the Woodstock generation
withered in the early '70s, so too did Ochs' spirit. Feeling he
lost touch with his audience and his abilities, he killed himself
in 1976 at the age of 36.
   But this is a case where the old cliche is true: the death
silenced Ochs, but not his music. Old Ochs songs have been ringing
out with regularity the last eight years in clubs from
Massachusetts to the Mason-Dixon line.
   Keeping the spirit of her younger brother alive, Sonny Ochs has
been organizing ``Phil Ochs Song Nights,'' during which old folkies
and younger performers highlight Ochs' extensive song catalog. A
typical performance recently in Albany, less than 40 miles from her
rural Middleburgh home, featured national folk stars Nancy Tucker
and Magpie sharing a club stage with local acts.
   ``I get all these people together through Phil's music,'' Ochs
said.
   She has been organizing the concerts since 1982, when choosing
the line-up for a planned memorial show at the now-defunct
Speakeasy in Manhattan inadvertently fell in her lap.
   ``I picked up the ball and ran with it and I've been running
ever since,'' she said.
   Ochs has since put on shows all over the East.
   ``I just did not want the songs to die. What would have been the
point of his life if no one listened to them anymore?'' she asked.
   Born Dec. 19, 1940, in El Paso, Texas, Phil Ochs was mostly
raised in the East. Following an in-and-out college career, he
headed to where every aspiring folkie headed in the early '60s -
Greenwich Village.
   ``I was very arrogant at the time, and I thought I'd be the best
songwriter in the world,'' he said. ``But then I immediately met
Dylan and decided that I'd be the second-best songwriter in the
world.''
   Ochs built a following on the strength of songs like ``I Ain't
Marchin' Any More'' and ``When I'm Gone.''
   A keen observer and sharp wit in the tradition of Woody Guthrie,
Ochs fired lyrical salvos at everyone from the Nixon administration
to fellow liberals. His acid tongue attracted listeners, but also
scared a lot of people off.
   ``Everyone just assumed he was a raving commie, but he wasn't,''
said Michael Ochs. Not as lovable as Peter, Paul &amp; Mary or as
drop-dead cool as his estranged friend Dylan, Ochs was mostly
ignored by the mass media.
   ``He was censored when he was alive,'' Sonny Ochs said. ``He
couldn't get on national TV or radio.''
   Even without media attention, Ochs could sell out a hall,
including Carnegie Hall three times, and he relied on album sales.
He also maintained a high profile in the civil rights and anti-war
movements.
   But he grew disillusioned when the anti-establishment fervor
faded after the '60s. He moved on to more introspective songs, and
he became depressed.
   ``He felt he didn't fit in anymore,'' Michael Ochs said.
   His sister said Phil felt he lost his gift for writing songs. He
began avoiding live appearances and stopped writing songs.
   ``He refused to even try,'' she said. ``The last three years
were the worst.''
   On April 9, 1976, he hanged himself in his sister's bathroom in
New York City.

<HEAD>A Hawk on the Gulf with a Friend in the White House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in the Persian Gulf crisis, Sen. Richard
Lugar was invited for a private dinner with the president and a few
advisers in the living quarters upstairs at the White House.
   For an hour and a half, they talked about Lugar's public
assertion earlier in the day that Saddam Hussein must either leave
power ``or be removed.''
   President Bush ``heard very well everything I had said,'' the
Indiana Republican later recalled in an interview. When Lugar told
him he planned to repeat the same ideas in a speech the next day in
Indiana, Bush did not try to dissuade him, even though the thought
of removing Saddam went well beyond any public administration
position.
   Asked whether he was pushing Bush to go farther, or giving voice
to things the president couldn't say himself, Lugar paused, then
smiled and said: ``Maybe both.''
   After five months of dealing with the crisis, it is clear that
some of the administration's toughest messages have been delivered
through Lugar, the most respected foreign policy voice in the
Senate.
   Lugar is sure to play a big role in the new session of Congress,
likely to be dominated by the gulf crisis. After reassembling
Wednesday, the nation's lawmakers will have to decide whether the
president can send American forces into an offensive war without
first obtaining congressional consent.
   To its own surprise, Congress also must look for a way to pad
the impact of the economic downturn at a time when the deficit is
growing beyond all expectations. And it confronts the possibility
that the nation's banks will need a shoring up - if not a
full-scale bailout.
   On the gulf issue, Lugar is sure to be heard. He pressed -
unsuccessfully - for an emergency congressional session to vote on
a resolution endorsing Bush's gulf policy. He has aligned himself
with a new group of congressional hawks formed to support a
hard-line approach.
   ``In general, he is the point man for the administration on the
Foreign Relations Committee,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a
member. ``My assumption is that whatever he says, he is also
speaking for the administration or with their approval.''
   The crisis is giving still more prominence to Lugar. At 58, he
is graying but trim, a jogger, a Senate workhorse. He was elected
mayor of Indianapolis when he was 35 and he remains loyal to Bush
even though it must have been painful when Bush reached over him to
select his junior partner in the Senate, Dan Quayle, as his running
mate in 1988.
   Not that everything Lugar says on the gulf pleases Bush. Lugar
has been the nagging voice asking some unpopular questions:
   -What does the United States do if Saddam Hussein withdraws from
Kuwait but remains in power in his own country with a million-man
army and nuclear ambitions?
   -Who starves first if the international food supply to Iraq is
cut off - soldiers, or children?
   -Why should Congress be allowed to criticize the U.S. military
buildup and snipe at the administration's policy without a formal
vote on whether it is willing to use military force to remove Iraq
from Kuwait?
   ``Somebody in the public dialogue has to raise these
questions,'' Lugar said. He denied that he was the launcher of
White House trial balloons, but added, ``My thinking is a fairly
careful fit with the way they see the world.''
   That has not always been the case. He earned his foreign policy
credentials during the Reagan administration, most often by pushing
the administration to do things it resisted.
   Lugar was the key to a policy shift that gave up on keeping
Ferdinand Marcos in power in the Philippines and he was a decisive
vote when Congress forced Reagan to accept economic sanctions
against South Africa. He also has been active in other arenas from
Central America to Southeast Asia.
   And the only foreign aid authorization bill to be passed by
Congress during the past decade came during Lugar's brief tenure as
chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in 1985-86, when the
GOP controlled the Senate.
   These days, he's not even the senior Republican on the
committee. That job belongs to Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who
pulled seniority to beat Lugar out of the post four years ago. The
bitterness lingers, and the two senators barely speak to each
other.
   But Lugar's credibility on foreign policy comes not from his
standing on the committee but his personal contacts and study
around the globe.
   ``He reads and studies issues, visits with a number of
specialists, and travels a fair amount,'' said colleague Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., who added that Lugar's game plan in foreign
affairs isn't always clear. ``He tends to keep his cards very close
to his vest,'' she said.
   Some have suspected that his toughness on the gulf issue might
be a form of political inoculation against a pre-invasion stand
opposing sanctions on Iraq for using poison gas against its own
citizens.
   Sanctions would have hurt American farmers, an important
constituency for the Indiana senator, and would have damaged
administration efforts at the time to strengthen Iraq as a
counterweight to Islamic fundamentalism in neighboring Iran.
   But Lugar denies that he's bending over backwards to make up for
that stand, saying he still opposes the use of food embargoes as a
foreign policy tool because it starves the innocent.
   Instead, he says, he wants to help shape what Bush has called
``one of the defining moments in history.''
   ``We are really coming to a crucial point as to whether there is
the potential for the world's people to unite in a crisis,'' he
said. ``That seems to be a ... pretty sober responsibility. Things
are going to happen, and the consequences are going to be very
substantial. ... I just see this as an amazing opportunity.''

<HEAD>Medical Stocks Thrive in Ailing Market</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the anemic environment that prevailed on Wall
Street in 1990, medical and drug stocks proved to be the best
prescription for financial health.
   At the same time, shares of bank and savings and loan holding
companies dominated the market's sick list as the year drew to a
close.
   Most broad-based indicators of stock-price trends showed
double-digit percentage losses for 1990 as of late December,
turning in their poorest performances since the bear market of
1981-82.
   Just 11 of 82 stock groups tracked by Dow Jones &amp; Co.'s
industry-group indexes posted gains for the year through the close
of trading on Dec. 21.
   Among the gainers, the medical and biotechnology group led the
pack with an advance of better than 20 percent, followed by medical
supplies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, health-care providers and
retail drug chains.
   The performance of these stocks testifies that health care
remains a booming, though by no means trouble-free, business in the
early 1990s.
   While the nation debates what to do about soaring health costs
and uneven distribution of medical services, many companies in the
field continue to thrive as the population ages and seeks longer,
healthier lives.
   Technology and other innovation add an extra measure of
opportunity, however risky in business terms, for venturesome
health-care enterprises both large and small.
   A just-published quarterly report by the Value Line Investment
Survey on the medical supplies industry cites ``growing demand for
health care, a decent pricing environment, and the entry of more
high-margined products'' as major reasons for recent enthusiasm
over stocks of this kind.
   Even the gloomy outlook for the economy has worked in favor of
health-care stocks, by encouraging investors to look for
``defensive'' issues that are insulated from the effects of a
business slump.
   As Value Line observed in its latest evaluation of the drug
stocks, ``pharmaceutical manufacturers have always been known for
their defensive characteristics.
   ``They look particularly recession-resistant this time around,
due to the elimination of many low-margined non-health care product
lines over the course of the last several years.''
   A standout example of a winning health-care stock in 1990: U.S.
Surgical, producer of a line of products used in surgical stapling,
which soared from 24&lsqb; in January to a recent high just under 70.
   Turn U.S. Surgical's stock chart upside down, and you would have
a pretty fair representation of what happened to many bank and
savings and loan issues over the past year.
   Dow Jones's S&amp;L index fell nearly 60 percent; its gauge of
money-center banks dropped 37 percent, and its composite of
regional banks from the various corners of the country lost 40
percent.
   The story gets even more somber when you look at the behavior of
many individual issues from the banking and S&amp;L sector - for
example, Bank of New England, which fell from above 9 to less than
1, for a drop of about 93 percent.
   First City Bancorp, Crossland Savings, Unionfed Financial,
Citytrust Bancorp and HomeFed all suffered declines of more than 80
percent.
   In the last few weeks of 1990, many depressed financial issues
have rallied a bit on buy orders from investors attracted by
distress merchandise.
   If the upswing in bank stocks were to continue, analysts say, it
might start shaping up as a signal that the worst of the nation's
spell of debt retrenchment and credit crunch were past.
   But whether any such hopes are warranted now remains to be
determined in 1991.

   Not long ago, Yolanda Whitaker was just another
kid growing up among gangs and drugs in south-central Los Angeles.
When she walked home from school, Crips gang members threw rocks at
her because she lived in a Bloods neighborhood.
   Fast forward five years.
   Yolanda is now known as Yo-Yo, one of the leading female rappers
to emerge from the decade-long, male-dominated rap revolution.
   She's only 19 and she has just one album to her name. But she's
made enough money to buy her own apartment in Hawthorne, a quiet
Los Angeles suburb light years away from Watts.
   She also gives women a voice in the macho, often misogynistic
rap industry. With such songs as ``Put a Lid on It,'' she sends a
message to the kind of teen-age girls she grew up with, urging them
not to have sex and babies so freely.
   Or, as she might say onstage, she's ``wreckin' rhymes and taking
names.''
   ``I address most of my rhymes to the ladies,'' she said during a
recent interview while on tour in New York. ``The ladies are
struggling. I try to inspire them to go after what they want and
work on their self-esteem.''
   Yo-Yo, a protege of former NWA member Ice Cube, is one of about
a dozen leading female rappers to break out in the last few years.
Their journey from anonymity to fame and fortune - they can make up
to $30,000 and more per week on tour - came astonishingly fast for
most of them.
   In an industry in which rap superstar MC Hammer, whose age
varies from 27 to 35 in published reports, might be considered
almost ancient, leading women rappers such as Yo-Yo, Queen Latifah,
M.C. Lyte, Salt 'n' Pepa, Monie Love, Nikki D, Shelly Thunder,
Oaktown 3-5-7, Tarrie B., Shazzy and Ms. Melodie are between the
ages of 18 and 25.
   Despite their youth, many are preternaturally wise and
self-confident. Yo-Yo, Queen Latifah and Nikki D are all barely out
of high school but hold forth in interviews and on stage like
wizened street sages.
   ``You have to be tough,'' said Nikki D. ``People will pull you
back in a heartbeat.''
   Nikki D, 22, sports a gold front tooth and grew up as Nichele
Strong in a middle-class Los Angeles neighborhood. But she went to
school ``with all the rough guys from the projects.'' She began
small-time rapping in roller rinks and small clubs.
   She met rapper Ice-T at a Culver City, Calif., mall and he asked
her to perform with him. When she was 18, she and a friend took a
bus to New York City, arriving with only 35 cents. A year later,
Nikki D was the first female rapper signed to Def Jam Records.
   But some of the swagger of female rappers is as much part of the
act as the attire. Many female rappers wear what they call
``b-girl'' (for ``beat'') clothes, baggy sweatshirts, jeans,
high-tops and baseball caps. Queen Latifah has made regal
Afrocentric clothing her trademark.
   They are the descendants of the few women such as Funky Four
Plus One More who began in the early days of rap in the late 1970s,
and others like Roxanne Shante and Salt 'n' Pepa who rode the wave
of the first commercially successful female rappers beginning in
1985.
   Some, such as Yo-Yo, grew up on mean streets with the
``gangstas'' that have become part of rap legend. Others lived near
the fringe of tough neighborhoods in New York City and North
Jersey, or from gang-ridden areas like Compton and Watts in Los
Angeles. Most write their own rhymes.
   They include 20-year-old Queen Latifah, the pre-eminent female
rapper, who was raised in Nwark and East Orange, N.J., and led the
Irvington (N.J.) High School women's basketball team to two
consecutive championships before abandoning sports for the mike.
   ``I think rap brings reality to people who aren't from the inner
city,'' said Latifah during a break from recording her next album.
``Whether you consider it positive or negative, we're teaching
reality.''
   Latifah, nee Dana Owens, began rapping in high school where she
started as a human beat box for two girlfriends known as Ladies
Fresh.
   She started making demos with the help of friends she met in the
rap industry and finally scored with ``Princess of the Posse,''
which was shown on ``Yo! MTV Raps'' and led to a contract with
Tommy Boy Records.
   Her debut was titled ``All Hail the Queen.'' Members of her
posse usually wear jackets labeled ``The Queen's Army.''
   More than any of her peers, Latifah epitomizes the proud, regal,
take-no-prisoners attitude of female rappers. In stark contrast to
the lyrics of male rap groups - 2 Live Crew, NWA, Public Enemy and
others - many female rappers write rhymes to raise the
consciousness and self-esteem of women.
   Yo-Yo recently started the I.B.W.C (Intelligent Black Women's
Coalition) which she said is aimed at increasing the status and
self-esteem of all women.
   Though women are often referred to as ``bitches'' and ``hos''
(whores) and portrayed negatively by male rappers, the majority of
women rappers say they do not take offense.
   ``None of it bothers me,'' said Nikki D. ``I wouldn't down any
rap. It's like our own language and not everyone understands that.
And the thing is, there are a lot of women like that.''
   Nikki D's lyrics are more macho than some, including the singles
``Lettin' Off Steam,'' and ``Up the Ante for the Panties.''
   The women said that they believe many male rappers put down
women because of the number of groupies who surround rap stars.
   ``There are a set of women who are golddiggers who will do
anything for a guy, sleep with him one night and never see him
again and that's OK,'' said Nikki D, whose own boyfriend, fellow
rapper Apache, accompanies her on tour.
   Latifah concurred.
   ``The girls they talk about have no respect for themselves and
they're materialistic,'' she said. ``I'm not like that.''
   Latifah wants her music, such songs as the anthem ``Ladies
First'' and ``Latifah's Law,'' to uplift women.
   ``You've got to be positive and strong and respect yourself,''
she said.
   Rap would seem to be a tough field to break into, but many
female rappers said they were encouraged by their male
counterparts.
   ``They were very cool with me,'' said Latifah. ``I had no
problem with the guys. I didn't get putdowns.''
   Nikki D still remembers the day in May 1987 when she came back
to a friend's apartment in New York and heard the voice of rap
impresario Russell Simmons on the answering machine.
   Simmons had just listened to her demo and liked what he heard.
   ``He was yellin', `she's dope!, she's dope! Where is she? I want
her?''' she recalled. ``I was like, ecstatic!''

   The closer 1991 gets the dicier it looks to Wall
Street analysts trying to sort out prospects for the economy and
corporate profits.
   The news on business activity has grown gloomier and gloomier in
the waning weeks of 1990, challenging widespread hopes in the
financial world that the economy might face nothing worse than a
short and shallow recession.
   The portents for the near future don't offer much consolation.
On Friday, the Commerce Department reported a fifth consecutive
monthly decline in the index of leading economic indicators.
   Many forecasters also lament that the special characteristics of
the current slump make its dangers hard to gauge.
   In most downturns of the past few decades, recessions ran their
course as businesses were able to work down inventories that had
built up in booming, inflationary periods.
   Now, most observers agree, the prime source of trouble lies not
in production and distribution, but rather in finance -
specifically, the accumulated debts of the past decade or more.
   In the absence of much recent precedent, analysts say it is
tough to calculate how long it might take or how much pain will be
required to complete the process of debt retrenchment.
   ``The need to reliquify after a decade of debt accumulation
should be the overriding force in the years ahead,'' said Jack
Lavery, director of global research at Merrill Lynch.
   ``The economy will likely remain in recession until the second
half of 1991. The recession is likely to be about average in length
and severity, with direction of risk on the weaker and more
protracted side.''
   ``We hate to be skeptical,'' adds Robert Nurock, a Paoli, Pa.,
investment advisor.
   ``However, we see little evidence that the economy is close to
bottoming. In fact, we believe that most of the recently released
data implies that the decline is accelerating.''
   Amid such misgivings, stock prices drifted lower in the past
week in extremely light activity surrounding the Christmas holiday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.45 to 2,629.21.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.22 to 179.65;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market dropped
2.41 to 371.20, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 1.55 at 304.65.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged only 87.47 million shares a
day, down from 176.70 million the week before.
   Even if the recession, as it is ultimately defined by
economists, turns out to be relatively mild, many analysts worry
that the ensuing recovery could be slow and painful.
   ``Once the U.S. economy emerges from the recession or
near-recession, we expect sluggish growth for years to come,''
Gerald Rothstein at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. told the firm's clients.
   ``Overall growth will be hampered by the hangover from
private-sector leverage and the need for private funds to be used
to fund the federal deficit and the savings and loan (and perhaps
banking) crisis.''
   Or, as analysts at the firm of Griggs &amp; Santow put it: ``This
slowdown has its origins in the excesses of the 1980s -
specifically the decision by all sectors of the economy to greatly
expand their debts and to take greater risks.
   ``All these activities were largely financed by institutions
that now find themselves the not-so-proud owners of real estate and
securities that are under water.''
   The real estate and junk-bond markets face problems now that go
well beyond any questions of Federal Reserve policy or the level of
interest rates, the firm asserts.
   ``Thus, look for the Fed, recognizing the nature of this
downturn, to move cautiously, despite its recent aggressiveness,
and for the economy to recover from this downturn very slowly.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Lost Job Means New Career for Joe Diffie</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   It took the closing of an Oklahoma
foundry to get singer Joe Diffie into the country music business.
   He had long dreamed of having a career in music, and when he was
laid off in 1986, he decided to move to Nashville and pursue one.
   The twist of fate paid off. Diffie's first record, ``Home,'' was
a No. 1 hit in November.
   ``Seeing it come to fruition is very gratifying,'' the
31-year-old performer said in an interview during his third day
back in Nashville after a whirlwind, five-week tour of
one-nighters.
   Diffie had been working at the foundry in Duncan, Okla., running
a core machine, when he lost his job and his $1,700-a-month salary.
   ``I never had any hair left on my arms; it was always singed
off,'' he recalled about the job. ``I always had burns all over me.
I detested every second of the job. I didn't like any aspect of it
except the people there.
   ``It was a blessing in disguise when it shut down. If it hadn't,
I'd probably still be there or some place like it.''
   After reaching Nashville, he took a job for 1{ years in the
shipping and receiving department at the Gibson Guitar factory.
   ``Home'' spent six weeks in the Top 10 on the country music
popularity charts, faring better than tunes by more estalished
singers such as Anne Murray and Eddie Rabbitt.
   The wistful song is about the values of home life:
   ``A swimming hole and fishing pole and the feel of the muddy
road between my toes ...
   ``A back yard swing where I would sit and mom would sing
`Amazing Grace' while she hung out the clothes ...
   ``An easy chair with my daddy there and the smell of Sunday
supper on the stove ...''
   Diffie said the song stirred strong emotions.
   ``I think everybody related to it, regardless of whether they
were raised in the country or city, because everybody has a home in
their memory. When I first heard it, I got a lump in my throat. It
brings back a feeling of when you were younger, safe and secure
without any worries and no problems.
   ``It was a sweet song but not too syrupy.''
   The tune is on his first album, ``A Thousand Winding Roads,'' on
Epic Records. The LP is a mixture of ballads and up-tempo songs
performed in a style described by Billboard Magazine as ``Randy
Travis with a Merle Haggard catch to his voice.''
   His second single released from the album is ``If You Want Me
To,'' a traditional country weeper about a man offering to leave
his lover if that's what she wants.
   Another cut on the LP, ``There Goes the Neighborhood,'' is a
ballad about marriages dissolving. The cut ``Almost Home'' is about
the decline of an aging parent.
   Diffie, who co-wrote four of the songs on the album, says he's
taken advantage of a new era in country music.
   ``There's been a changing of the guard in country music: the
listeners, the artists, the radio stations and the people producing
the records,'' he said.
   ``The songs are getting better and better with the new
songwriters coming in. That's not to say the old ones are bad. But
it's almost like country music has got a little edge to it now.
   ``Some of the more sensitive matters are being touched upon.''
   Diffie is a native of the Duncan area and spent much of his life
there. His father had a huge collection of country music and his
parents instilled in him a love of the music. He remembers singing
``Amazing Grace,'' ``You Are My Sunshine'' and ``Peace in the
Valley'' with his two sisters while they traveled in the family
pickup truck.
   He briefly attended Cameron University in Oklahoma and eyed a
career as a heart surgeon or chiropractor, but he was more
interested in music.
   He has a six-piece band and a fan club with the catchy name
``Diffie Cult.'' Keeping things in the family, his mother is its
president.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's only law regulating video
display terminal use was signed Thursday by Mayor Art Agnos, who
touted the ordinance as being ``on the cutting edge of social
change.''
   The law covers city workers and businesses with 15 or more
employees.
   It requires employers to provide adjustable work stations,
regular breaks and training on safe use of VDTs. The law also
recommends that pregnant VDT users be shifted to other work if they
request it.
   Employers would have been given two years to make the changes,
but a compromise worked out last weekend between Agnos and business
and labor leaders gives employers four years to comply.
   ``This legislation ... will ensure San Francisco workers are
protected from dangerous injury, without driving away businesses,''
Agnos said. ``It's legislation on the cutting edge of social
change.''
   One voice raised against the measure is that of Tom Hsieh, a
member of the Board of Supervisors who contends it violates the
city charter. Legal authorities in City Hall say he's wrong.
   A similar ordinance, passed in 1988 in Suffolk County on New
York's Long Island and bitterly opposed by business owners, was
overturned a year later by a state court on the grounds the local
government lacked authority to make such rules. That decision is
under appeal.
   The San Francisco legislation was pushed by a coalition of
activists who cited potential risks to VDT operators, including
repetitive strain injury, back and neck pain, deteriorating vision
and miscarriage.
   Hsieh said the city charter prohibits supervisors from changing
working conditions for city employees without studies by the Civil
Service Commission. Jonathan Holtzman, special assistant in the
city attorney's office, said the provision only applies to changes
in pay, not safety measures.
   The law will affect an estimated 56,000 workers. In its first 30
months it will cost businesses about $14 million, said Paul
Varacalli, executive director of Service Employees International
Union Local 590, which backed the measure.
   He estimated the cost of bringing the city into compliance at
$231,552.
   The 11-member Board of Supervisors is to vote next month on the
compromise program of compliance.
   Under the program, new equipment would have to meet standards
set in the ordinance after one year. For existing work stations,
retrofitting costing less than $250 would have to be completed
within 30 months. Retrofitting costing more than $250 would have to
be completed within four years.
   The compromise was reached after business and labor officials
said time constraints in the ordinance were unacceptable.
   ``We hope that careful administration of this ordinance provides
something we all can live with,'' said Gwen Kaplan, president of
the San Francisco Small Business Association. ``At best, it's a
first step toward long-range solutions.''
   Varacalli said the push to provide legal guarantees for VDT
safety won't end in San Francisco.
   ``We know it cannot stop here. This is the beginning. We had to
have a beginning,'' he said.

   A transformer explosion and fire in Lower
Manhattan delayed stock trading nationwide for 90 minutes, a

   The trading halt on Thursday marked the third such disruption

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Orders to manufacturers for ``big ticket''
durable goods plummeted 10.5 percent in November, the government
said. The report likely signals more layoffs in the factory sector,
which lost 200,000 jobs last month and more than 800,000 in the
last two years.
   The drop in orders matched the post-1958 record falloff for one
month, set in January of this year and reduced orders to a
seasonally adjusted $115.9 billion, the lowest level since May
1988, the Commerce Department said.
   Also Thursday, the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee,
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., predicted that nationwide unemployment
could hit 8 percent in the current downturn. The jobless rate rose
to 5.9 percent last month.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Gasoline at the pumps has fallen nearly 9 cents
a gallon since the week before Christmas, the biggest weekly drop
in prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the American Automobile
Association said.
   Self-serve unleaded cost $1.282 a gallon this week, according to
an AAA survey of stations nationwide released Thursday. That's 8.9
cents lower than the price on Dec. 18, and the lowest since a

   TOKYO (AP) - Eighteen directors of Mazda Motor Corp. are
voluntarily taking temporary pay cuts to impress upon employees the
seriousness of a government warning to pay stricter attention to
car safety, the company said.
   ``In Japan, there is an old saying that superiors must suffer
first in order to motivate workers,'' said Maza spokesman Tetsuo
Nagase on Thursday. The pay cuts were decided after the Transport
Ministry, investigating charges that Mazda has been replacing
defective parts during routine maintenance, warned the company to
pay stricter attention to safety.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The labor market continues to weaken, judged by
the volume of help-wanted advertisements in newspapers around the
country, the Conference Board reported.
   The Board on Thursday said ad volume declined last month in all

Atlantic regions posting the steepest drops.

   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Coal is still king in West Virginia,
but it's a monarchy where more and more subjects are opting for a
new realm. West Virginia lost a higher percentage of residents than
any other state, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.
   A dip in the market in the mid-1980s, as well as the automation
of the industry, were among factors in a mass exodus in the 1980s.
   According to U.S. Census Bureau figures released Wednesday, West
Virginia's population was 1,801,625 this year, a 7.6 percent
decline from the 1,949,644 counted in 1980.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Food and Drug Administration says it will
test raw milk weekly around the nation to determine if it contains
certain antibiotics.
   The agency said on Thursday 250 locations across the country
will be chosen for testing and raw milk samples will be collected
each week from five of these sites, selected randomly.
   The samples will be tested for the presence of eight sulfa drugs
and three tetracycline drugs. The FDA said that when residues are
found, the states will be told and the agency will help track down
the source.

   TOKYO (AP) - A legislator has been charged with evading more
than $12 million in taxes on stock profits, prosecutors announced,
a day after he resigned from the governing party.
   The case represents a new blow to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's
Liberal Democrats party, which was discredited last year by a
separate political scandal.
   Toshiyuki Inamura, 55, who served as a Liberal Democrat in the
House of Representatives, was charged on Thursday with evading
$12.7 million in taxes on profits of $20.8 million from stock
dealings from 1986 to 1988, according to the Tokyo Public
Prosecutors Office.

   Eighteen directors of Mazda Motor Corp. are
voluntarily taking temporary pay cuts to impress upon employees the
seriousness of a government warning to pay stricter attention to
car safety.
   ``In Japan, there is an old saying that superiors must suffer
first in order to motivate workers,'' Mazda spokesman Tetsuo Nagase
said Thursday, explaining the action announced a day earlier.
   Mazda said Wednesday that Chairman Kenichi Yamamoto and 17 other
directors would take a pay cut of 5 percent to 10 percent in the
first three months of 1991 in connection with a recall of nearly
3,500 cars.
   The pay cuts were decided after the Transport Ministry,
investigating charges that Mazda has been replacing defective parts
during routine maintenance without recalling the cars or notifying
the government, warned the company to pay stricter attention to
safety.
   After the warning, Mazda notified the ministry Tuesday it would
recall 3,498 Luce model passenger cars produced between Aug. 8,
1986, and Jan. 31, 1987, because of switch defects in their stop
lights and cruise control mechanisms.
   Nagase said the directors' pay cut ``has a very symbolic meaning
and employees will realize it. ... We believe cutting directors'
salaries is a more effective way of having workers realize the
importance of the matter than cutting workers' pay.''
   He also said it would have been ``very un-Japanese'' to try to
pinpoint an individual or department for blame.
   ``Pinpointing who is responsible and firing him would not solve
the problem,'' Nagase said.
   Hajime Karatsu, a professor at the Research and Development
Institute of Tokai University, said that whenever something goes
wrong for Japanese corporations, the first move is for directors to
take salary cuts.
   In extreme cases, business and political leaders offer their
resignations. In a recent example, the chairman of Sumitomo Bank
stepped down to take responsibility for illegal loans allegedly
arranged by a branch manager for stock manipulation.
   ``All the responsibility should be placed with managers, that's
the way of thinking in Japan,'' Karatsu said.
   He said actions such as executive pay cuts were a modern form of
``hara-kiri,'' the ritual suicide by disembowelment practiced by
high-ranking Japanese to avoid disgrace.
   But spokesman Nagase said Mazda did not view the government
warning as a matter for which the company needed to take
responsibility. He said Mazda broke no laws and violated no
regulations.
   ``We and our president have acknowledged that our judgment was a
bit shortsighted,'' he said.
   He said company officials told the ministry that Mazda will try
to streamline its quality check systems.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
today as share prices finished lower on the year's final trading
day at the stock exchange.
   The Tokyo stock market has customarily ended the year on a
rally, said Keiji Arai of Sanyo Securities.
   ``We are closing the year still suffering from the aftereffects
of the big stock market plunge this year,'' he said.
   The dollar closed at 136.05 yen, down 0.60 yen from Thursday's
close of 136.65 yen. After opening at 136.35 yen, it ranged from
135.80 yen to 136.63 yen. Spot trading totaled $5.5 billion, down
from the preceding day's $6.019 billion.
   The Tokyo foreign exchange will close next Monday for the New
Year holiday and reopen Jan. 4.
   Dealers said trading was sluggish with no new market-affecting
factors.
   Importers finished buying the dollar for year-end settlements,
which had helped push the dollar up recently, said Akihiko Kagawa,
a dealer at the Bank of Tokyo.
   The dollar had also strengthened on news of political
instability in the Soviet Union and continuing conflict in the
Middle East, rising 3.62 yen in the previous six trading days.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed
at 23,848.71 points, down 91.99 points or 0.38 percent from
Thursday's finish at 23,940.70 points.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a thin 180 million
shares.
   Investors were reluctant to take risks before the exchange
closes for a six-day holiday, while international conditions
remained unstable, Arai said.
   After today's half-day session, the exchange will be closed
until Jan. 4 for the year-end and New Year holiday.
   The Nikkei index dipped nearly 50 percent over the summer
months, since closing at 38,915.87 points Dec. 29, the final
trading day of 1989. Trading for 1990 started Jan. 4 with the index
closing at 38,712.88 points, and the Nikkei never closed higher.
The index hit the year's record-low close of 20,221.86 points on
Oct. 1.
   Traders said the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait set the stock
index tumbling, as investors became nervous about the Japanese
economy. Japan is heavily dependent on imported oil, most of which
comes from the Middle East.

   Stock prices slipped this morning in early

continued economic decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 10.90

   The government said this morning its chief gauge of future
economic activity dropped for the fifth consecutive month in
November.
   The 1.2 percent decline in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators followed an even worse 1.3 percent drop
in October. That decline, revised from a previous estimate of 1.2
percent, was the steepest since November 1987.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped for the fifth consecutive month in November, the
government said today in a report that offered little hope the
slumping economy would recover soon.
   The 1.2 percent plunge in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators followed an even worse 1.3 percent drop
in October. That decline, revised from a previous estimate of 1.2
percent, was the worst since November 1987.
   The latest steep drop follows a spate of gloomy economic news
for the month, including a jump in the unemployment rate and
plunging orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods such as
automobiles and appliances. It was seen as a sign the economy would
continue to deteriorate.
   ``I think it's consistent with the other evidence that the
recession is clearly in place and clearly has further to go,'' said
economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Stock prices slipped this morning in early trading following the
release of the report.
   ``The November indicators leave no doubt that a serious and
lengthy recession is under way,'' said economist William K.
MacReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The only remaining
questions are just how far the economy will plummet and how long it
will stay there.''
   Three consecutive declines in the index - designed to predict
economic activity six to nine months in advance - are considered a
fairly good, but not infallible, sign a recession is approaching.
   The index rose slightly as recently as June, but most private
economists believe the nation has already toppled into a recession.
   In November, eight of the 11 forward-looking components of the
index fell.
   Pulling the index down, in order of importance, were: a decline
in new orders to factories for consumer goods, a drop in prices of
raw materials, a decline in the backlog of unfilled orders at
factories, a fall in new orders for business investment equipment,
a jump in new claims for unemployment benefits, a decline in the
average workweek, a contraction in the inflation-adjusted money
supply and a drop in building permits.
   The only positive contributors were an increase in stock prices,
a slowing in business delivery times and a slight improvement in
consumer confidence following a plunge after Iraq's August invasion
of Kuwait.
   The various changes left the index at 139.7 percent of its 1982
base of 100, down 4.4 percent from its 146.2 peak in June. It has
been the worst multiple-month retreat by the index since 1981, at
the start of the last recession.
   The consensus of most analysts so far is that the current
economic contraction will be a relatively mild one, shorter and
less harsh than the 16-month 1981-82 recession, which was the worst
since the Great Depression.
   An outbreak of war in the Persian Gulf could change that by
sending oil prices soaring again, thus squelching any tendency for
the economy to start growing again.
   The Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a consensus forecast of 52
top economists, says the economy already is in a recession. On
average, it expects th gross national product to decline 1.3
percent in the September-December quarter and an additional 0.9
percent during the first three months of 1991. A recession is
usually defined as at least two consecutive quarters of
contraction.
   The forecasters predict the economy will begin growing again in
the second quarter next year.
   However, a significant minority of analysts say the nation is
heading for a protracted and deep recession. They were further
discouraged Thursday when the Commerce Department reported new
orders for durable goods plunged 10.5 percent in November.
   That matched the sharpest decline on record, set last January,
and depressed orders to the lowest level in 2{ years.
   ``I'm in the pessimistic camp. I think this recession will be
one of the longer ones in the post-World War II period,'' said
economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.
   Sohn said the drop in orders means that factory payrolls, which
have declined by 800,000 jobs since January 1989 - 200,000 in
November alone - will shrink further.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, chairman of the congressional Joint Economic
Committee, predicted Thursday that the nation's unemployment rate
could rise to nearly 8 percent from the current 5.9 percent. That's
about 1.5 percentage points worse than most private analysts are
expecting.
   ``We will, in fact, have a recession,'' Hamilton, D-Ind., said
in his 1991 outlook. He based his jobless rate forecast on average
increases in unemployment in downturns since World War II.

   Orion Pictures Corp. agreed to give its
majority shareholder a cut of profits from the movie ``Mermaids''
in return for a $23 million investment.
   Shareholder John W. Kluge and his partner Stuart Subotnick,
executive vice president of Kluge's Metromedia Co., will receive up
to 64 percent of certain profits from the movie, according to a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In addition, the filing indicates the pair may receive certain
profits from Orion's next scheduled release, ``The Silence of the
Lambs,'' should receipts from ``Mermaids'' prove disappointing.
   The romantic comedy starring Cher and Winona Ryder grossed $8.3
million over the Christmas holiday weekend.
   An Orion spokeswoman would not comment Thursday on the $23
million investment - in the form of a joint venture called
MetMermaids - saying she could not reach top executives for an
explanation.
   Kluge holds about 70 percent of Orion shares.
   Orion recently retained the New York investment banking firm
Salomon Bros. to find new sources of money.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending the previous session's losses on reduced fears of frost
damage to the winter wheat crop.
   Most areas of the Midwest where soft red winter wheat is grown
had adequate snow and ice cover to protect the crop from recent,
bitterly cold weather, analysts said.
   They said selling in the soybean complex reflected expectations
that heavy deliveries will posted Monday against the January
soybean, soybean meal and soybean oil contracts.
   Monday is first notice day for those contracts, the first
opportunity for traders to attempt physical delivery of commodities
they sold in advance.
   Trading activity was extremely quiet, which is typical of the
holiday period.
   ``Give us another five minutes and I think we'll be asleep,''
said John Frazier, director of agricultural trading with Gerald
Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2} cents to 3\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $2.59\ a bushel; corn
was \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.32\ a bushel; oats were
1\ cents to 1} cents lower with March at $1.11} a bushel; soybeans
were 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with January at $5.60} a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February
at 77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .27 cent
lower with January at 89.12 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent
lower to .15 cent higher with February at 48.97 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .38 cent higher with February
at 63.10 cents a pound.
   Most livestock and meat futures fell on Thursday. Pork bellies
were down sharply on signs of new supplies being moved into cold
storage.

<HEAD>Barclays to Acquire Europeenne de Banque</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French government has approved plans by
Barclays Bank of Britain to acquire Europeenne de Banque for 1.5
billion francs, or $300 million, bank officials said in a joint
release Friday.
   The British banking group will acquire 51 percent of Europeenne
de Banque initially and will purchase the remaining 49 percent
early next year, the statement said.
   A protocol agreement was reached earlier this month between
Europeenne de Banque, a unit of Credit Commercial de France, and
the French subsidiary of the Barclays group.
   The acquisition will give Barclays some prestigious real estate
in central Paris, 16 branch offices throughout France and a
financial distribution network through Europeenne de Banque's
subsidiary Lafitte Investissement, which has 24 offices and a
direct sales force operating as financial consultants.
   Barclays already has a French presence through its French
subsidiaries Barclays Bank SA, Cie Financiere Barclays and its
stock brokerage Puget-Mahe SA.
   CCF put Europeenne de Banque up for sale at the beginning of
1990. It announced in May that it was negotiating with the National
Westminster banking group of Britain, but negotiations broke off
two months ago.
   Barclays, which has a weaker French presence than National
Westminster, its main British competitor, then stepped in with its
offer.
   Europeenne de Banque reported consolidated net profit of 25
million francs, about $5 million, for the first half of 1990, down
slightly from 28 million francs a year earlier.
   It had total assets of 13.78 billion francs, about $2.75
billion, at the end of 1989. Net profit for all of 1989 was 61.7
million francs, or $12.3 million.

   American Airlines Inc. says its pilots' unreliable
attendance will force the nation's second-largest carrier to reduce
its schedule by about 4 percent and lay off some employees.
   Meanwhile, the pilots union has told members to obey a temporary
restraining order against the tactics that management alleges have
caused delays and flight cancellations.
   The Allied Pilots Association has denied American's charges that
pilots have been staging sickouts, taxiing slowly to waste fuel and
filing frivolous requests for equipment maintenance.
   But a taped message from APA president Fred Vogel on Thursday
advised pilots not to employ ``supposedly contrived slowdown
devices,'' or to call in sick if they are not ill, The Dallas
Morning News reported.
   The APA, which represents the Fort Worth-based carrier's 8,700
pilots, has been in contract talks since October 1989. The old
contract expired Jan. 1, 1990.
   American spokeswoman Lise Olson said typically 300 pilots will
call in sick on a given day, but since Dec. 21 more than 500 a day
have been out sick. Some 250 pilots are over in Saudi Arabia for
Operation Desert Shield, and that compounds the problem, she added.
   The temporary restraining order came late Wednesday from U.S.
District Judge John McBryde barring pilots from actions designed to
influence contract negotiations.
   The union said it will challenge the ruling, which it called a
``rush to judgment.''
   Vogel, an American pilot, raised concerns that management ``may
use the order in a way that will impair safe operations.''
   The message told union members: ``The responsibility for safe
operation of the aircraft is yours, and neither the company nor the
court will help you if there is an incident in which you say you
were influenced by the court's order.''
   American spokesman Tim Smith denied Thursday that pilots would
be jeopardizing air safety by obeying the judge's order.
   ``Nobody is asking anyone to compromise safety, and I don't
think anyone has compromised safety,'' Smith said. ``We're talking
about unnecessary safety or mechanical write-ups that were not
borne out in fact.''
   McBryde set a Jan. 3 hearing date to determine whether the
temporary injunction should be made permanent.
   By late Thursday, 24 flights were canceled, 13 of them
crew-related, Smith said. Since Sunday, 352 flights have been
canceled, including 78 that were crew-related. The airline handles
about 2,300 flights per day.
   Smith said decisions on what flights would be reduced and who
would be laid off will not be made until next month. The airline
will seek to cut flights from areas with the least demand, he said,
and passengers booked on those flights will be notified in advance.

   The stock market remained on the defensive today
amid worries about the prospective length and severity of the
economic slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks slipped 4.46
points to 2,621.04 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 592 up, 848 down and
535 unchanged.
   The government reported this morning that its chief gauge of
future economic activity dropped for the fifth consecutive month in
November.
   The 1.2 percent decline in the Commerce Department's index of
leading economic indicators followed a 1.3 percent drop in October.
   Three consecutive declines in the index, which is designed to
predict economic activity six to nine months in advance, are
considered a strong sign of an impending recession.
   On Thursday, Commerce said new orders for durable goods tumbled
10.5 percent last month.
   Confronted with such data, many economists have lately been
cutting their forecasts for growth and profits at least through the
early stages of 1990.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Express, down \ at
20&lsqb;; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down &lsqb; at 30; Boeing, down &rsqb;
at 45{, and Philip Morris, down &rsqb; at 50}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.35 to 179.13. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .10 at 303.57.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 78.40 million shares with two

<HEAD>Bonds, the Glitzy Investment in a Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With recession on most economists' calendars for
the first half of 1991, the outlook for bonds is good.
   U.S. Treasury bonds, the safest investment available,
historically do well in recessions as the stock market, real estate
and other investments appear at their riskiest.
   Economists forecast rallying bond prices will push the yield for
the 30-year Treasury bond down to around 7.5 percent in 1991. The
benchmark bond has been yielding around 8.30 percent in recent days
and was above 9 percent as recently as early October.
   The bond market has been rallying since the Federal Reserve
early last month signaled it was ready to lower interest rates to
increase economic activity.
   The Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate three times in
December -in 0.25 percentage point increments - to 7 percent. The
central bank also lowered the discount rate by 0.50 percentage
point to 6.5 percent.
   The fed funds rate is the overnight loan rate between banks. The
discount rate is the Fed's loan fee to banks.
   Two factors could strongly affect bond prices and their yields.
The Persian Gulf crisis continues to be unpredictable and Federal
Reserve policy as always will influence bond yields.
   There is strong pressure from Washington for the Fed to ease
more aggressively. However, some on Wall Street are concerned that
lowering interest rates too much would cause more inflation, which
erodes the value of fixed-income securities like bonds.
   ``If the Fed moves too quickly inflation expectations could
rise,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns &amp;
Co. As it has thus far, the Fed should take its cue from the bond
market and gold prices, according to Kudlow. Falling gold prices
and rising bond prices should precede another Fed easing move, he
said.
   Kudlow expects long-term bond yields to fall to 7.60 percent by
mid-year and fluctuate around there for the rest of the year.
   John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.,
expects long-term interest rates could fall to 7.35 percent if core
inflation - excluding food and energy - is significantly reduced.
   ``Increased government borrowing will put pressure on bond
yields, but cutbacks in private sector borrowing will ensure an
adequate amount of funds,'' he said. Also, banks and others will
put more money in Treasury securities.
   The safety of Treasury bills, notes and bonds historically
attracts investors wary of the risks inherent to investing in a
recession. Treasury securities are seen as extremely safe because
they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government. If the federal government couldn't pay its debts, money
wouldn't be of much use because the economy would be in shambles.
   Corporate bond prices are expected to follow Treasury bonds. The
fortunes of corporate borrowers, and their ability to repay debt,
will be helped if interest rates go lower.
   ``The corporate market is basically trying to determine the
outlook for profits, cash flows and credit worthiness - there's
nothing better than lower interest rates,'' Kudlow said.
   Junk bonds will probably still be in the dumper in the coming
year.
   In 1990, $22 billion in corporate bonds - issued by 91 companies
-defaulted, according to preliminary numbers compiled by the Bond
Investors Association. In 1991, the non-profit group that tracks
bond defaults expects $25 billion worth of corporate debt to
default.
   The recession, combined with the absence of demand for new
issues of junk bonds, is causing the spiraling default rates, said
C. Richard Lehmann, BIA president.
   Before the collapse of the junk bond market, issuers could avoid
default and restructure their debt by floating new bonds. Now that
junk bond buyers have all but disappeared, that option has been
removed.
   The trend lately has been for issuers to give up equity to
bondholders to entice them to agree to a restructuring.
   Some investors, most notably TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn, have
been selectively buying junk bonds with hopes of picking up a
profit in a debt-for-equity swap.

<HEAD>Magistrate Denies Bail for Former Vernon Owner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vernon Savings Association owner Don R.
Dixon will remain in jail until his February sentencing on bank
fraud charges, a federal magistrate ruled Friday.
   Dixon has been jailed without bond since his conviction Dec. 20
on 23 bank fraud charges.
   Attorneys asked U.S. Magistrate John Tolle to release Dixon
Friday pending sentencing on Feb. 19. Eighteen witnesses testified
on Dixon's behalf, including his wife and former minister.
   But the judge said the testimony did not refute government
evidence that the former Vernon owner was likely to flee.
   After Dixon's conviction, federal prosecutors asked that he be
jailed without bail because FBI investigators suspect he has money
stashed in foreign bank accounts and might flee the country.
   Dixon, dressed in an orange jail uniform, listened quietly
during the ruling.
   In the court papers, Dixon said he is ``not, under any
circumstances, likely to flee.''
   Among the paperwork submitted on his behalf were 81 letters from
relatives, friends and business associates.
   One of the letters was from Dixon's 6-year-old granddaughter.
Written in her first-grade scrawl, it reads: ``Dear Judge. Can Big
Daddy get out of jail. He will not leave town. Love, Candice.''
   Deborah Goodall, an attorney for Dixon, said the defense sought
to prove that Dixon is not a flight risk. She said the letters
submitted to the court show that Dixon has ``a long, solid history
of facing his problems rather than avoiding them.''
   Dixon said he needs to be free until sentencing so he can
``implement a family survival plan based on the probability I will
be incarcerated for some considerable time.''
   Vernon Savings failed in 1987, and its bailout is expected to
cost taxpayers more than $1.2 billion.
   Dixon and his wife, Dana, declared personal bankruptcy in 1987,
and Dixon said he has no money or other financial resources of any
consequence.
   He has supported his wife, three of his eight children and his
mother-in-law for the past two years, he said, with about $9,000 a
month that he has borrowed from relatives and other sources and
earned as an independent financial consultant.

   Cash-strapped Pan Am said Friday it has had no
word from TWA owner Carl Icahn on whether his takeover proposal
still stands and whether the ouster of Pan Am Chairman Thomas
Plaskett was a condition for the deal.
   Officials at Trans World Airlines' suburban Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
offices did not return several phone calls seeking confirmation
that Plaskett's removal was on a list of terms attached to a
proposed merger of the two carriers.
   That caveat was cited by unidentified sources quoted in Friday's
editions of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said that while the proposal to
remove Plaskett ``has not been forthcoming from Mr. Icahn, Mr.
Plaskett will do whatever is in the best interest of Pan Am and its
shareholders.'' That presumably does not preclude stepping down
from the executive suite.
   The Journal said Icahn was understood to lack confidence in
Plaskett's management abilities. Plaskett, who once led an investor
group on an abortive attempt to acquire Northwest Airlines' parent
NWA Inc., has been trying to sell off Pan Am assets to raise cash
to keep the carrier alive.
   The marriage maneuvering between TWA and Pan Am is the latest
sign of how a declining U.S. economy and a sharp rise in jet fuel
prices since the Persian Gulf crisis last August have severely hurt
the airline industry, especially financially weak carriers such as
TWA and Pan Am.
   Both airlines pioneered overseas travel and were once leading
international competitors but are now scrambling to retrench and
shrink - to the benefit of healthier airlines. Pan Am already has
sold some of its most attractive European routes to United
Airlines, while TWA has done the same in a deal with American
Airlines.
   Icahn earlier this month suggested he would be willing to
acquire Pan Am for $225 million in cash and $150 million in debt
securities. But he has yet to present Pan Am with a formal
proposal.
   Apparently there was some confusion over when exactly Icahn
would unveil his merger plan to Pan Am. Bickering erupted after
Icahn claimed Pan Am canceled a meeting last Monday; Pan Am
countered that no meeting had been scheduled.
   Part of Icahn's proposal is understood to require Pan Am to seek
Chapter 11 protection from creditors in order to receive a large
loan to carry it until the merger with TWA is consummated.
   Pan Am disagrees with that approach. ``The company is opposed to
entering into an agreement with Mr. Icahn that has as a condition
the company filing Chapter 11,'' Hanlon said.
   The newspaper reports said Icahn would replace Plaskett with Pan
Am's chief financial officer, Richard Francis, who has been
negotiating with the TWA chief. The carrier's general counsel,
Roger Cooke, also would be retained, the published accounts said.
   Plaskett is not believed to have been directly involved in the
talks with the Icahn team.
   While acquirers often replace managers once a deal is completed,
it's less typical for personnel issues to surface so early in
negotiations.

<HEAD>Fees for Underwriting Stocks and Bonds Hit Six-Year-Low</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fees earned on Wall Street for underwriting
corporate stocks and bonds plunged in 1990 to a six-year low,
providing further statistical evidence that the booming 1980s have
died.
   Combined with a sharp drop in other critical investment banking
activity and thousands of layoffs, analysts said the figures
released Friday signal losses at many securities firms for the
year.
   ``It's definitely meaning weaker profitability for all the
firms, even historically strong ones,'' said Mara Hilderman, a
senior analyst with Moody's Investors Service.
   Investment banking fees from new issues of stocks and bonds
plunged 38 percent to $1.93 billion from $3.09 billion in 1989,
Securities Data Co. reported. The figure was the lowest since $1.41
billion in 1984, before Wall Street's three-year surge.
   Despite the decline, overall new issues reached a record $312
billion, up from $309 million last year, said Securities Data, a
Newark, N.J.-based firm that compiles Wall Street statistics.
   But securities industry experts said the total masked a
fundamental malaise in corporate America and on Wall Street. Other
figures showed that a late-1990 decline had begun to set in, due to
the slumping economy and Middle East crisis.
   IDD Information Services Inc., another Wall Street data firm,
said total domestic underwriting volume in the fourth quarter of
1990 declined sharply from the same 1989 period.
   ``We're in a market that's in a doldrums,'' said Samuel B. Hayes
III, an investment banking professor at the Harvard Business
School. ``For corporations, the prospect of selling stock at this
point looks as though it's very expensive money.''
   Securities Data said the total volume of common stock issued
fell 16 percent to $19.2 billion in 1990, while initial public
offerings of stock tumbled 26 percent to $13.7 billion.
   Those figures reflect companies' diminished ability and desire
to raise money by selling shares to the public. Hayes said that as
stock prices dropped in 1990, corporations balked at selling what
would have amounted to cheap shares.
   Wall Street firms serve as intermediaries for stock and bond
offerings. They acquire the securities from companies and then
resell them to the public, charging a fee for the service.
   Raising money by offering debt in the form of corporate bonds
rose by 3.6 percent in 1990 to $282.5 billion, IDD reported, but
several key component areas fell, including straight debt and junk
bonds.
   The market for risky high-yield bonds dried up, with just 10
junk bond offerings totaling $1.3 billion in 1990, compared to 25
issues totaling $25.3 billion in 1989, IDD said.
   Despite the overall rise in total new issues, fees declined
because of increased competition and the drop in common stock and
junk bond underwriting, which historically has generated the
largest fees, analysts said.
   More Japanese, German and Swiss investment firms are competing
with domestic firms for U.S. deals. Also, the growth of practices
such as ``shelf underwriting'' - in which a company opens the
bidding among investment firms for a deal - have driven down fee
commissions.
   ``There's just been an absolute compression on fees because of
intense competition,'' Hilderman said.
   Not all of Wall Street's losses are due to the decline in
underwriting fees. Other key areas for big investment banks also
fell sharply in 1990, particularly mergers and acquisitions fees
and takeover-stock speculation.
   Securities firms are cutting back to stanch losses. They are
slashing payrolls, abandoning struggling business areas and
focusing activities on money-producing areas, such as stock and
bond trading.
   In the third quarter of 1990, New York Stock Exchange member
firms lost $124 million. For the first nine months of the year,
profits were just $22 million, compared with $1.28 billion the same
year-ago period. Less than half of the 334 firms reporting were
profitable, the NYSE said.
   Since peaking at 262,000 workers at the end of the September
1987, industrywide employment stood at 214,000 at the end of
September this year, the Securities Industry Association said.
Several thousand jobs in the last three months have pushed the
employment decline over 5,000.

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS December to January in 4th graf and CORRECTS
week-earlier price to $4.038</NOTE>

   The lowest silver prices in nearly 15 years aren't stimulating
much demand, but some analysts see modest gains for investors
willing to wait.
   ``I'm not so sure we've seen the ultimate lows,'' said Bernard
Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
   Nevertheless, investor buying during the last two weeks of 1990
helped lift the spot silver price on New York's Commodity Exchange
back above $4 per troy ounce after it fell on Dec. 14 to $3.93, the
lowest level since February 1976.
   Silver for January delivery settled Friday at $4.19 a troy ounce
compared with $4.038 a week earlier.
   ``I think some large investors are taking a renewed look at
silver at these low prices,'' said Research Analyst Joseph Rosta of
CPM Group, a precious-metal research and consulting firm in New
York.
   ``Silver prices are extremely low and I think that on the part
of some major players in the market, there is a feeling that prices
may be reaching a cyclical low,'' he said.
   Silver's value tumbled this year from more than $5 an ounce as
the economy weakened. Sliding stock prices and slowing industrial
output raised concerns about demand for silver from the electronics
and jewelry industries, which together account for about 60 percent
of silver consumption, and the photographic industry, which
represents about 40 percent of silver demand.
   A general easing of inflation fears in the second half of the
year prompted unloading of silver bullion by investors, who tend to
buy precious metals as an inflation hedge.
   Domestic silver consumption in the coming year is generally
expected to outpace the supply of newly mined and recycled silver
but U.S. stockpiles are more than adequate to meet the demand.
   The Silver Institute, an industry trade group, estimates 1990
U.S. industrial consumption at 123 million troy ounces; the
Commodity Exchange reported silver inventories of more than 265
million ounces as of Thursday.
   ``As long as we have Comex stocks representing well over two
years of consumption, it is unlikely that we will have a
sustainable rally in silver prices,'' said PaineWebber analyst Fred
Demler.
   He said silver could test $3.80 an ounce in 1991 and he would
not rule out the possibility of a slide to $3.50 ``on a very
short-term basis.''
   Rosta said he concurred with the Silver Institute's cautiously
bullish long-range forecast for silver in the 1990s, which projects
a 3 percent to 4 percent annual increase in silver demand versus a
2 percent rise in supply per annum.
   Demler agreed that silver has the potential to provide a decent
return in the long run.
   ``For those looking to hold silver for five to 10 years, these
are very attractive levels,'' he said.
   ``On the other hand, anyone who bought silver 10 or 15 years ago
and held it has a loss on their hands at this point.''

<HEAD>Dollar Down Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply on world currency
markets Friday, with extremely thin trading accentuating the
downward move.
   Gold prices staged a strong advance in domestic dealings,
boosted by the weak dollar. On the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery jumped $8.60 to settle at $394 a
troy ounce. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for
gold of $393 an ounce, up $8.60.
   The dollar began declining in Asian trading and continued to
fall when dealings shifted to Europe as investors took profits.
   Shortly before the U.S. market opened, ``the dollar fell hard
across the board'' and was unable to stage a convincing recovery,
said Marc Chandler, an analyst with the firm IDEA.
   Traders received more negative news about the U.S. economy in a
Commerce Department report showing that the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators fell 1.2 percent in November, its fifth
consecutive monthly decline. Normally three consecutive monthly
declines indicate a recession is imminent.
   ``It was much below expectations,'' Chandler said of the figure.
As the economy weakens, pressure builds on the Federal Reserve to
lower interest rates to stimulate growth. But lower interest rates
are bearish for the dollar because they erode the value of
fixed-income investments like bonds.
   The sharp decline in the dollar came despite a political
backdrop that would appear to support the currency. Tensions in the
Persian Gulf as well as political strife in the Soviet Union might
encourage investors to seek a safe haven in the dollar.
   Chandler maintained that the U.S. currency would trade still
lower if not for these political developments. ``The full
dimensions of the current economic contraction aren't being fully
appreciated by the market,'' he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 136.05 Japanese yen from
136.65 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it traded at 135.05 yen.
In New York the dollar settled at 134.90 yen, down from 136.40 yen
on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9220 from $1.8870 late
Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9282 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.8895.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.4935 German marks, down from 1.5255;
1.2745 Swiss francs, down from 1.3040; 5.0810 French francs, down
from 5.1935; 1,126.50 Italian lire, down from 1,151.75, and 1.1601
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1616.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.4970 German marks, down from 1.5310; 1.2780
Swiss francs, down from 1.3090; 5.0930 French francs, down from
5.2050; 1.6890 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7292; 1,127.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,152.75; and 1.1607 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1618.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $385.75 a troy ounce,
from $382.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $386.00, from $382.20. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold
rose $1.36 an ounce to close at a bid $385.43.
   Silver prices also rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.190 a troy ounce, up from $4.093 on
Thursday. In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $4.14 a
troy ounce, from $4.08.

<TEXT>
   Canada's state-owned nuclear power
company signed a $535 million (U.S.) contract Friday to build a
nuclear power plant for Korea Electric Power Corp.
   The deal is a coup for the Canadian government and caps more
than 10 years of sales efforts by its Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.,
or AECL. It will be the second Canadian reactor built in Korea.
   Officials said the 700,000-kilowatt power plant, estimated to
cost a total of about $1 billion U.S., will be built in Wolsong,
160 miles southeast of Seoul. It will be built next to the first
Canadian reactor, which has been operating since 1983.
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said William B. Schumacher, the Canadian
ambassador to South Korea. ``A deal of this size has implications
for bilateral relations. It opens up a basis for broadening even
further the relationship.''
   South Korea and Canada are each other's fifth-largest trading
partners. Trade between the companies is expected to reach $4
billion (U.S.) in 1990.
   The Korean power company, or KEPCO, has nine nuclear power
plants in operation and two more under construction. The government
expects to have 50 nuclear plants in operation in the next 40
years.
   A nuclear reactor provides heat that converts water into steam.
The steam is then fed from the reactor into a turbine system to
convert into electricity.
   Schumacher said South Korea is the only country using two
complementary kinds of nuclear reactors, a heavy-water reactor
developed by Canada and the more commonly used pressure water
reactors.
   The Canadian model uses natural uranium and heavy water. That
means the so-called Candu reactor can use the spent fuel from
pressure-water reactors, enabling Korea to reduce the amount of
nuclear waste it generates, experts said.
   The sale should also prove beneficial to AECL. It is the
company's first in nine years and could provide a boost to Canada's
nuclear industry.
   A turbine generator for the new plant will be supplied by
General Electric Co. along with Korea Heavy Industries and
Construction Co. under a contract to be signed soon, officials
said.
   AECL will receive about 60 percent of the total contract sum.
Korean subcontractors will receive the other 40 percent for
providing components and services, KEPCO said.
   Construction will begin next July and is scheduled to be
completed by mid-1997.
   The contract was formally signed at a ceremony Friday by Ahn
Byong-wha, president of KEPCO, and Dr. Stanley Hatcher of Toronto,
president of AECL.

<HEAD>The Bad News At-A-Glance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief rundown of bad economic news over the past few
weeks, which has contributed to the growing view that the economy
is in recession:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>UNEMPLOYMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Dec. 7 that joblessness, one of the most
sensitive and widely followed measurements of economic health,
surged to a three-year high of 5.9 percent in November, reflecting
the worst stretch of layoffs since the 1981-82 recession. The areas
hardest hit were in manufacturing but the cutbacks were spread
throughout all segments of the economy.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>NEW ORDERS OF GOODS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Thursday that new orders for goods
designed to last at least three years plunged 10.5 percent in
November, equaling the record drop set last January. The drop in
this key barometer intensified fears that thousands of additional
workers will be laid off from manufacturing jobs.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>STAGNANT CONSUMER SPENDING AND INCOME</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Dec. 20 that consumer spending rose only
0.1 percent in November, historically one of the strongest months
for spending as the Christmas holiday approaches. At the same time,
the government said personal incomes increased only marginally,
barely keeping pace with the inflation rate. Economists called the
findings important evidence that the consumer is frightened and is
clamping down on spending.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOUSING</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Dec. 19 that construction of
single-family homes in November sank to its lowest level since
1982, reflecting a clampdown in mortgage lending by troubled banks
fearful of getting stuck with more bad loans. The National
Association of Realtors, a leading trade group, reported Dec. 26
that sales of existing homes rose 3 percent in November after two
straight monthly declines, but economists said it was premature to
draw any conclusions that the slump was easing.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FAITH IN THE ECONOMY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Conference Board, a leading business research group,
reported Thursday that its monthly survey of consumer confidence in
the economy remained unchanged in December but still was much lower
than a year earlier, hurt by fear of job security and the Persian
Gulf crisis. At the same time, the board said its monthly survey of
help-wanted advertising in newspapers plunged to a five-year low in
November, suggesting that the demand for workers has fallen
substantially.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>THE WEATHER</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The worst cold in decades froze much of the citrus and other
crops in California, a critical supplier of the nation's fresh
produce during the winter months. The devastation made it likely
that consumers, already paying more for fuel because of the Persian
Gulf crisis, would pay sharply higher prices for fruit and
vegetables.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>THE NEXT SIX-NINE MONTHS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Friday its chief economic forecasting
gauge plunged 1.2 percent in November, the fifth straight monthly
drop, offering almost no hope the economy will revive soon. The
Index of Leading Indicators, which measures the economic pulse in
categories ranging from jobless claims to stock prices, is designed
to predict the outlook six to nine months in advance.

<HEAD>Crude Rises in Light, Rumor-Driven Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rumors of shots fired in the Middle East drove
up the price of crude oil futures Friday in thin trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude for
February delivery rose 56 cents to $27.57 per barrel. For the week,
crude oil gained $1.65 a barrel.
   The Merc was closed on Monday and Tuesday for Christmas. Am
abbreviated session is set for Monday and the market will be closed
on New Year's Day.
   Traders said volume was light as many market participants
refrained from trading at the end of the month and year, and
because of an absence of significant news on the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Andrew Lebow, a senior broker with E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said traders bought futures after a trading floor
rumor that shots had been fired in the Iraq-U.S. standoff.
   Lebow said he believed the rumor resulted from confusion over
reports that Iraq test fired a surface-to-surface missile for the
second time this week. U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia said the
missle was fired away from multinational forces and landed within
Iraq.
   The approach of the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait has agitated the market. Oil prices are
expected to surge if war breaks out because of reduced supplies
from the Middle East.
   ``It's jittery,'' Lebow said. ``The closer we get (to Jan. 15)
the more nervous people are going to get.''
   In other developments Friday, a 17-ship carrier armada embarked
to bring America's naval deployment in the region to a level
unprecedented since the Vietnam war. Also, Saudi Arabia reportedly
increased orders for jet fuel, interpreted by the oil market as a
sign of war preparations.
   The first snowfall of the season in the Northeast failed to
support the market for home heating oil, which has slumped because
of recent warm weather.
   Home heating oil futures fell 1.10 cents to 79.79 cents per
gallon on the Merc on contracts for January delivery after falling
0.38 cent on Thursday. Traders said forecasts of warm weather in
the Northeast over the weekend pushed prices down. Later months
were mostly higher.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for January delivery rose .92 cent to
69.56 cents a gallon after a 0.50-cent rise Thursday. Later months
also were higher.
   Natural gas for February delivery was down 1.0 cent at $1.950
per 1,000 cubic feet. Later months were mixed.

<HEAD>Sharp Drop in Light Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices staged a sharp retreat in light
holiday trading Friday in response to war-like news about the
Persian Gulf and a better-than-expected jobless report.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond dropped 21-32 point, or
$6.56 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when the
price falls, rose to 8.30 percent from 8.24 percent late Thursday.
   The session was one of the most lightly traded of the holiday
season, with many traders absent due to New York's first snowfall
and to holiday vacations. Government securities markets closed at 3
p.m. instead of the usual 5:30 p.m. because of the inclement
weather and the coming New Year's holiday.
   Market participants blamed much of the long bond's price drop on
the release of a government report of better-than-expected
unemployment figures.
   The Labor Department reported that claims for state unemployment
insurance, on a seasonably adjusted basis, fell by 14,000 to
441,000 in the week ended Dec. 15 from 455,000 claims the week
before.
   ``The figures were not as bad as had been the case,'' said Kevin
Flanagan, a money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Signs of economic upturn are generally viewed as negative by the
government securities market because the Federal Reserve would be
less likely to ease interest rates to stimulate the economy.
Falling interest rates boost the value of existing bonds.
   However, the market was little moved by a Commerce Department
report showing the Index of Leading Indicators fell 1.2 percent in
November, the fifth consecutive monthly decline. Economists said
many of the components of the index have already been reported.
   But the bond market was thrashed by several Persian Gulf
developments that traders saw as heightening the prospects for war
in the troubled region, thus raising fears of higher inflation.
   Analysts said the next important clue to how the economy was
faring would come next Friday with the release of the government's
monthly unemployment report.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities were down 1-16 point to unchanged, intermediate
maturities were down 5-32 point to 11-32 point, and long-term
issues lost 19-32 point to 21-32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial
information service reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 2.59 to 1,180.74.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 6.62 percent as the
discount dropped 5 basis points to 6.43 percent. Yields on
six-month bills were down to 6.85 percent as the discount fell 4
basis points to 6.54 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 6.90
percent as the discount fell 2 basis points to 6.49 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7{ percent, down from 10 percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged from late Thursday's 91\. The
average yield to maturity also held steady at 7.47 percent.

<HEAD>Consequences of GATT Breakup May Not Be Dire, Trade Specialists
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>by DORIAN BENKOIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When talks at the world's major trade forum
collapsed earlier this month, experts and headlines echoed each
other in hand-wringing dismay over the loss of a chance to set
visionary rules for the 21st century.
   But not all agree the consequences of a breakdown would be dire.
   A small but vocal group of experts argues that the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is, at best, imbalanced. Further,
some say, the world is becoming so economically interdependent that
trade will increase exponentially in coming decades even without a
broader agreement.
   ``We might end up having a thoroughly free trading world because
it is imposed by economic realities rather than policy-makers and
politicians,'' says world trade expert Dominick Salvatore of
Fordham University in New York.
   Even without a GATT agreement, bilateral trade talks will
continue. U.S. and Japanese negotiators, for example, have
continued talks under the Structural Impediments Initiative, aimed
at reducing internal barriers to trade in their countries. U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter visited European Community
counterpart Ray MacSharry a few weeks ago to discuss trade.
   The latest GATT talks, launched four years ago in Uruguay, were
suspended Dec. 7 in Brussels after the United States and other
agricultural exporters demanded deep cuts in agricultural subsidies
- a politically explosive issue in the 12 EC nations and Japan,
where farmers form strong political blocs.
   The talks aim to overhaul the world trade system by rewriting
rules and lowering barriers in 15 areas, including textiles,
agriculture, manufactured goods and services, such as banking,
telecommunications and construction.
   U.S. negotiators hope that if developing nations gain markets
for their food exports, they will in turn grant concessions in the
newer areas the GATT doesn't cover: financial services, high
technology and so-called ``intellectual property,'' such as patents
and copyrights - all of which most analysts agree hold the highest
potential for future growth in developed nations.
   When the 107-nation talks were halted, some feared the end of
the pact credited with slashing barriers to trade. Since the GATT
was signed in 1947, global trade has increased over five times in
real terms to about $4 trillion in 1990.
   There is still hope for GATT. The talks could resume as early as
January, and a deadline set by Congress of March 1, 1991, to vote
on a world trade treaty can easily be extended two years at
President Bush's request. ``The next two months will probably
decide it,'' said Julius Katz, deputy United States Trade
Representative.
   But Salvatore and others argue that the GATT is off-base,
anyway. They say that the United States naively cajoles other
nations to hold to fair trade principles, but those countries
aren't even convinced laissez-faire capitalism is best for them.
   ``My concern is it's the wrong fight at the wrong place at the
wrong time,'' Salvatore says. ``The future lies not in
agriculture...It is in high technology.''
   Even if GATT succeeds, it may not bring the huge trade flows
negotiators are promising.
   Clyde V. Prestowitz and Robert W. Jerome, of the Economic
Strategy Institute in Washington, disparage a U.S. estimate that a
new GATT agreement could bring an extra $1 trillion in trade over
the next decade.
   ``Bemoaning the fate of the Uruguay Round is kind of misplaced,
because no matter what came out of that round, we (the United
States) were going to have problems,'' says Prestowitz, president
of E.S.I.
   Prestowitz and Jerome say that under the current system the more
liberal trading nations lose.
   Under current ``national treatment'' and ``most-favored-nation''
rules, a GATT country must treat other members the same way it
treats businesses at home. No matter how restrictive a country's
home policies, it can take advantage of more liberal members'
internal rules, say Jerome and Prestowitz.
   Prestowitz, a former U.S. Commerce Department official, cites
European government backing for the Airbus airliner.
   ``The Europeans have been pursuing development of the Airbus for
20 years, subsidized to the tune of about $28 billion,'' he says.
``We're not losing market share because our planes are bad or our
prices too high. ... We're losing it because we're being
outsubsidized.''

   International Business Machines Corp.
announced plans Friday to establish a major telecommunications
networking hub for the Asia-Pacific region in Australia.
   The move would see IBM double its existing Sydney-based
networking capacity over the next two years.
   IBM's branch manager, Hilton McKeener, said the decision
emphasized the computer company's confidence in Australia as a
major regional center for investment.
   Regional hubs provide a secure and cost-effective way for
international companies to channel their business data, computer
communications and telephone traffic throughout a region and around
the world.
   IBM's decision to place the hub in Australia has been claimed as
a coup by Australia's government-owned worldwide communications
company, OTC Limited.
   OTC has secured hub contracts for Australia with about 100
companies, including MasterCard and Bankers Trust.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Dec. 17, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Friday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,323.4 billion from $3,318.8 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,093.2 billion from $4,088.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $823.9 billion from $820.7 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 3.9 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.6 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,318.8 billion, a 2.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,087.2 billion, up 0.2 percent, while M1
rose 3.9 percent to an average of $821.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $830 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$133 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Dec. 12, down from $319.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   Some late buying of blue chips enabled the stock
market to finish mixed Friday in a session dominated by worries
about the prospective length and severity of the economic slump.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 10
points in the early going, closed with a 3.71 gain at 2,629.21.
   That trimmed the average's loss for the holiday-shortened week
to 4.45 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
712 up, 800 down and 511 unchanged.
   The government reported Friday morning that its chief gauge of
future economic activity dropped for the fifth consecutive month in
November.
   The 1.2 percent decline in the Commerce Department's index of
leading economic indicators followed a 1.3 percent drop in October.
   Three or more consecutive declines in the index, which is
designed to predict economic activity six to nine months in
advance, are considered a strong sign of an impending recession.
   On Thursday, Commerce said new orders for durable goods tumbled
10.5 percent last month.
   Confronted with such data, many economists have lately been
cutting their forecasts for growth and profits at least through the
early stages of 1991.
   With one session left in 1990, the Dow Jones industrial average
shows a net loss of 123.99 points, or 4.5 percent, since New
Year's.
   Gainers among the blue chips included DuPont, up \ at 36};
General Motors, up &lsqb; at 34{; General Electric, up &lsqb; at 57&rsqb;, and
McDonald's, up \ at 28}.
   But American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dipped &lsqb; to 30 and
International Business Machines was down \ at 113&rsqb;.
   Bank stocks, one of 1990's poorest-performing groups, finished
mostly lower. Citicorp dropped \ to 12}; J.P. Morgan \ to 43};
Manufacturers Hanover ~ to 21~, and BankAmerica { to 26.
   Precious-metals stocks rose, by contrast, as the gold market
showed some yearend strength. Gold futures for January delivery
climbed $8.60 an ounce to $394 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange
in New York.
   Homestake Mining added 1\ to 18|; Battle Mountain Gold { to 6~;
ASA Ltd. 1~ to 45{, and Newmont Gold 2\ to 40|.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 111.04 million
shares, against 102.90 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 145.77 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.06 billion, or 0.10
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .17 to 179.65.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.89 to 385.26, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.43 at 328.72.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .15 to 371.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 304.65, up .98.

<HEAD>After a Down Christmas, What's Ahead for Retailers?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The difficult Christmas season has ended, but
many of the nation's retailers are finding it hard to breathe a
sigh of relief. With the outlook poor for consumer spending in the
first half of 1991, many still have tough sledding ahead.
   As a result, retailers are retrenching, paring inventories and
expenses and in some cases, closing stores. Others, in financial
distress, are expected to seek refuge in bankruptcy courts.
   ``It's going to be terrible,'' was the way Daniel Barry, a
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. industry analyst, summed up the outlook.
   The Christmas season, when retailers hope to make half their
annual profits, was disappointing as consumers put fears about the
economy and the Middle East ahead of holiday sentimentality.
   The nation's biggest retailers will report sales for the month
of December on Thursday, but several already have said it was a
dismal or at best trying season.
   Many economists predict consumers will spend cautiously well
into 1991 as the recession continues. That means Americans will
limit what is called discretionary spending - outlays for
non-essentials such as toys, furniture, appliances, even clothing.
   With retailers dependent on such expenditures, a further
slowdown is expected to be devastating for 1991 earnings. Thomas J.
Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los
Angeles, predicted overall industry profits would fall about 30
percent in the first quarter and 15 percent the second quarter.
   Even before Christmas, retailers were taking steps to reduce
inventories, and many have said they are trying to keep merchandise
levels tight going into the new year.
   ``We will continue to plan very conservatively,'' Kenneth Macke,
chairman of Dayton Hudson Corp., said last week. Macke reported his
Christmas sales were unchanged to 1 percent higher than a year
earlier, a disappointing performance.
   Retailers, especially apparel merchants, will be taking fewer
chances in 1991.
   ``They're going to choose very carefully things to sell,'' said
Walter Loeb, a retail analyst and consultant. ``They're going to
buy classic clothes which are safe.''
   Some companies are taking more drastic steps. One retailer,
Younkers Inc., which owns 34 department stores in five midwestern
states, announced last week it was closing three small, marginally
profitable stores in Nebraska.
   ``It's just a sound business decision,'' company president
Thomas Gould said.
   Others, including such big names as R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. and
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., have already sold extra stock or
some of their stores to try to reduce their debt loads.
   Macy got a $119 million cash infusin from a sale of stock
earlier this month and has been buying back some of its junk bonds.
Macy, which had a disastrous Christmas a year ago and has been
under pressure to reduce its multi-billion-dollar liabilities,
fared better this holiday season, according to a source familiar
with the retailer's results.
   Macy's sales ``volume was not good in comparison to last year or
to others in the recent past'' but because of lower inventories and
reduced expenses, ``our margins this Christmas were well above a
year ago,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Carter Hawley Hale, which operates department stores in
California and the West, recently sold its Thalhimer Brothers
division in the Southeast to reduce its debt. The company lost
$14.9 million in its first quarter, which ended in November, after
losing $26 million the previous fiscal year.
   For some retailers, the recession will mean more business.
   Storeowners who can offer consumers the lowest prices should do
well, said Tashjian.
   Close-out retailers such as Pic 'N' Save Corp., who buy
manufacturers' overstock and sell the goods at a steep discount,
and discount retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are likely to
fare better than competitors, Tashjian said.
   Wal-Mart's sales gains consistently outpace those of other
discounters because its distribution system is more modern and
efficient, Tashjian said, adding, ``The company is in a position to
have better pricing and still be profitable.''
   Wal-Mart said last week it was pleased with Christmas results,
but the company found it difficult to draw customers.
   Some retailers are beginning the new year in bankruptcy court.
   On Friday, Youthland Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based chain of 26
children's clothing stores, filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   The retailer said it had lost money for seven consecutive
quarters and blamed the losses on a heavy debt load, poor locations
for its stores and the economy.
   Analysts expect other bankruptcies, largely among smaller,
privately-held retailers and companies that are overburdened by
debt.
   ``There'll be hundreds of little firms that go out of business
that you'll never hear about,'' Barry said.
   Retail capital spending may also be a victim of the business
slowdown. With less money available from banks, fewer shopping
malls will be developed, Loeb predicted.
   But at Dayton Hudson, no major changes are planned in the
company's capital spending plan, Macke said.
   Macke said he was looking pessimistically at business for the
first part of 1991, noting that consumers traditionally spend more
at Christmas than any other time of the year.

<HEAD>SEC Report on 1989 Mini-Crash Calls for Tighter Specialist
Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
report on the October 1989 market drop, called on the nation's two
major stock exchanges Friday to tighten performance standards for
professionals who regulate trading flow.
   The SEC said the New York and American stock exchanges performed
well overall during the 190-point tumble in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average on Oct. 13, 1989, and a subsequent sharp rise on
Oct. 16.
   But the report cited several problems in the handling of trading
on the exchanges and at the automated National Association of
Securities Dealers system and called for several revisions in how
trading is regulated.
   The SEC's division of market regulation said some exchange floor
market makers, known in the industry as specialists, failed to
perform adequately during the volatile trading, and said the
exchanges should review performances and take ``appropriate
remedial action.''
   Specialists generally match up buyers and sellers of stock, but
are required to correct imbalances by making purchases or sales
from their own supplies when necessary to maintain fair and orderly
markets.
   The SEC report said the exchanges should use their authority to
reallocate stocks when they determine that specialists display a
``substantial or continued failure'' to maintain orderly markets
during volatile times.
   It also said the NYSE, Amex and regional stock exchanges should
consider developing capital levels for specialists based on
individual stocks. Specialists are required to ``make markets'' for
trading of particular stocks.
   The Amex said in a statement that it continually reviews
specialists' performance, did so for the October 1989 market drop
and ``has taken appropriate action where warranted.''
   ``However, we believe that overall our specialists performed
exceptionally well during this difficult period,'' the statement
said.
   An NYSE spokesman could not be reached for comment. The exchange
in the past has ardently defended its market-making system, saying
specialists helped prevent financial catastrophe during the 1987
and 1989 market declines.
   With regard to the options markets, the SEC report recommended
improving procedures for halting and reopening the trading of
options contracts linked to indexes of stocks during times of
extreme price movements.
   The report also was critical of the NASD's over-the-counter
market, saying that some market makers withdrew from trading during
the drop. But it said the over-the-counter market in general
performed well.
   Overall, the SEC said the markets performed better during the
October 1989 mini-crash than during the October 1987 crash, partly
due to safeguards implemented after the 508-point drop in the Dow
Jones average.
   The report was the second part of the SEC's analysis of the 1989
market slide. In June, the SEC concluded that the drop was
accelerated by index arbitrage and other computerized program
trading strategies. That report was criticized by other agencies
and many Wall Street officials.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped again in November for the fifth consecutive monthly
decline, the government said in a report that offered little hope
the slumping economy would recover soon.
   The 1.2 percent plunge in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators, reported Friday, followed an even
worse 1.3 percent drop in October. That decline was the worst since
November 1987.
   The steep drop follows a spate of gloomy economic news for the
month and was seen as a sign the economy would continue to
deteriorate.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Cash-strapped Pan Am said it has had no word
from TWA owner Carl Icahn on whether his takeover proposal still
stands and whether the ouster of Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett
was a condition for the deal.
   Unidentified sources quoted in Friday's editions of the Wall
Street Journal and the New York Times said Plaskett's removal was
on a list of terms attached to a proposed merger of the two
carriers.
   Officials at Trans World Airlines' suburban Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
offices did not return several phone calls seeking confirmation of
that caveat.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Fees earned on Wall Street for underwriting
corporate stocks and bonds plunged in 1990 to a six-year low,
providing further statistical evidence that the booming 1980s have
died.
   Investment banking fees from new issues of stocks and bonds
plunged 38 percent to $1.93 billion from $3.09 billion in 1989,
Securities Data Co. reported Friday.
   Combined with a sharp drop in other critical investment banking
activity and thousands of layoffs, analysts said the figures signal
losses at many securities firms for the year.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A Supreme Court justice refused to block the
$7.4 billion purchase of movie-making MCA Inc. by Japan's largest

   Justice Antonin Scalia on Friday rejected an emergency request
by Go-Video Inc. to block consummation of the deal set for
Saturday. Go-Video sought a postponement until a formal antitrust
challenge could be mounted.
   The deal by giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. will be the

   WASHINGTON (AP) - ``Keating Five'' Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. is

insurance industry, warning that the nation cannot afford to ignore
the development of problems similar to the savings and loan
debacle.
   Riegle, D-Mich., who chairs the Senate Banking Committee asked
the Treasury Department to examine whether insurance companies have
made too many risky investments and to estimate the risk to the
economy of a major insurance company failure.
   Riegle made the requests in a letter dated Dec. 20 and released
Thursday.

   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. on Friday
said it would take a $170 million one-time charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to adjust for retiree health benefits.
   The charge includes $74 million in major medical insurance
benefits for retirees granted in a labor contract signed Dec. 19,
spokesman Ray Thompson said.
   It also includes $96 million for changes in retirees' medical
and life insurance benefits to update previous estimates of health
coveage, the company said in a news release.
   Wheeling-Pitt said the charge was required to show the company's
expectations of medical costs and to reflect accounting changes.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board recently approved a new
rule, effective in 1993, that requires companies to subtract from
earnings a portion of the costs of benefits they have promised to
future retirees.
   The change is designed to give investors and others a more
accurate picture of a company's health by better stating what its
long-range obligations to retirees will be.
   Meanwhile Friday, the company said a federal judge in Pittsburgh
had granted a temporary stay delaying the company's emergence from
bankruptcy protection. The stay was requested by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, the Economic Development
Administration and Farmers Home Administration.
   Wheeling-Pitt sought bankruptcy protection in 1985, and its
reorganization plan had been approved Dec. 18 by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.
   A hearing on the stay was scheduled for Jan. 3.
   Wheeling-Pitt, the nation's 10th-largest steel producer, employs
about 7,100 workers at six plants in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West
Virginia.

   Western Union Corp., the communications
pioneer that has foundered because of heavy debts, said Friday it
was close to alleviating a substantial part of its obligations.
   The company said enough bondholders appeared to have accepted
its offer to exchange high-yield ``junk bond'' debt securities for
50 cents on the dollar.
   The announcement suggested the company has avoided a cash
crisis. There had been persistent speculation that Western Union
could have been forced into bankruptcy-court refuge because of its
debts.
   When the exchange offer expired midnight Thursday, preliminary
figures indicated that $328.6 million of the debt securites, which
paid 19\ percent interest, and $5.9 million of securities, which
paid 16 percent interest, had been exchanged for the cash, company
spokesman Warren Bechtel said.
   Western Union had offered to make the exchange for up to $350
million worth of these securities. A minimum of $250 million of the
19\ percent notes had to be tendered for the proposal to go
through, Bechtel said.
   The apparent success of the offer would mark the end of a
grueling five-month ordeal for Western Union, which has been
struggling to satisfy bondholders afraid they wouldn't get repaid.
   The company, based in Saddle River, N.J. originally had proposed
exchanging $530 million of high-yield notes for lower-yield notes
plus stock. After numerous deadline extensions for acceptance of
that offer, Western Union realized it wouldn't be accepted and
offered the cash instead.
   ``I guess (the cash tender offer was successful) because a
substantial percentage of noteholders concluded that it was prudent
to accept 50 cents on the dollar now rather than taking their
chances going forward on what they might get,'' Bechtel said.
   When the offer went into effect Nov. 29, C. Richard Lehmann of
the Bond Investors Association advised bondholders to ``take the
money and run.''
   The exchange offer will erase $334 million from the liabilities
side of Western Union's balance sheet, reducing the company's debt
to about $311 million, Bechtel said.
   Completion of the cash tender hinges on the sale of most of
Western Union's Business Services Unit to American Telegraph and
Telephone Co., Bechtel said.
   That transaction, expected to go through Monday, will net
Western Union $175 million, Bechtel said.
   Most of the money will be used to fund the cash tender offer;
the rest will go to repay interest on an additional $196 million
worth of junk bonds that has been due since June 15, he said.
   Western Union is one of the the country's oldest companies,
known for its telegram and telex communications services. But the
company has failed to keep pace with enormous leaps in
communications and information technology dominated by rivals such
as AT&amp;T and regional Bell phone companies. Western Union hasn't
made a profit in years.

   American Airlines could be threatening passenger
safety if pilots are discouraged from calling in sick or filing
maintenance requests, union officials said Friday, but the carrier
called that statement ``hogwash.''
   The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 8,000
pilots, has told members to obey a temporary restraining order
against the illegal tactics that management alleges have caused
delays and flight cancellations.
   But pilots said the injunction, granted Wednesday by U.S.
District Judge John McBryde, could jeopardize passenger safety if
i is used to inhibit pilots from filing necessary maintenance
requests and staying home when they are sick.
   The clash over the court ruling is the latest in an increasingly
testy struggle between American and its pilots, who have been
working without a contract for nearly a year. McBryde set a Jan. 3
hearing date to determine whether the temporary injunction should
be made permanent.
   ``We pointed out to the court that there is a danger that the
company may use the order in a way that will impair safe
operations. We cannot permit that to happen,'' APA president Fred
Vogel told pilots in a taped message on the union's telephone
hotline.
   The union has denied American's charges that pilots have been
staging sickouts, taxiing slowly to waste fuel and filing frivolous
requests for equipment maintenance.
   American spokeswoman Lise Olson said typically 300 pilots will
call in sick on a given day, but since Dec. 21 more than 500 a day
have been out sick.
   She said 204 flights had been canceled as of Friday afternoon,
48 of which were crew-related. A snowstorm in the northeast caused
most of the others, she said.
   Ms. Olson said the airline never would compromise passenger
safety.
   ``That's hogwash. It's not our intention to endanger anyone,''
Olson said. ``We would expect all of our employees to act
professionally.''
   Vogel said sick pilots could fail FAA-administered drug tests if
they are forced to work after taking certain over-the-counter cold
remedies. He added that pilots will not be able to blame such an
incident on the injunction.
   ``You can bet your bottom dollar it will be the pilots who bear
the responsibility if there is an incident,'' Vogel said.
   The APA has been in contract talks since October 1989. The old
contract expired Jan. 1, 1990.
   On Thursday, American said the pilots' unreliable attendance
will force the nation's second-largest carrier to reduce its
schedule by about 4 percent and lay off some employees.

<HEAD>What's in a Name? S.N.L. Financial Would Rather Switch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A victim of the savings and loan crisis -
on the language front, anyway - has decided it's easier to switch
than fight.
   S.N.L. Financial Corp. changed its name this week to Security
National Financial Corp. to avoid confusion with the spoken
shorthand for the industry known for multibillion-dollar losses and
unscrupulous bankers.
   ``Over the past year, we've been concerned that many people have
confused our business with the savings and loan business,'' said
George Quist, president of the financial firm that no longer wants
its name pronounced S&amp;L.
   ``This name change to Security National Financial Corp. should
resolve the confusion and more accurately reflect our activity,''
he said.
   The company markets insurance and annuity products in 17 western
states and owns and operates cemeteries and mortuaries in Utah and
Arizona.
   The change, approved by stockholders at a meeting Thursday,
means the company's new stock symbol on the National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system, or NASDAQ, will be
SNFCA.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Surge on Gulf Fears, Weak Dollar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   War fears and a weaker dollar helped push gold futures prices to
their highest levels in nearly three months Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange. Other precious metals also rose sharply.
   On other commodity markets, crude oil rallied; copper futures
surged; orange juice retreated; grains and soybeans were lower; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $8.60 to $9.10 higher with the contract for
delivery in January at $394 a troy ounce, the highest settlement of
a near-month gold contract since Oct. 8.
   Silver futures were 9 cents to 9.9 cents higher with January at
$4.19 a troy ounce; platinum futures finished $4.50 to $7.20 higher
on the New York Mercantile Exchange with January at $409.90 a troy
ounce.
   Prices soared in thin trading conditions as the dollar weakened
and tensions in the Middle East mounted.
   The rally strengthened as gold broke out of its recent trading
range and the February contract burst through successive levels of
resistance at $390, $391.50 and $394 an ounce.
   February gold settled near the day's high at $396.20,
``suggesting to me that the next stop will be somewhere in the low
$400 area,'' said Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with
Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   The Pentagon denied market rumors of a military clash in the
Middle East but the talk underscored the anxiety that continues to
build as the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq's withdrawal
from Kuwait approaches.
   In developments Friday, the Pentagon announced plans to
vaccinate troops against possible germ warfare attacks by Iraq, and
a 17-ship carrier armada set sail to bring America's naval
deployment in the region to a level unprecedented since the Vietnam
war.
   Analysts said some buying also reflected position-squaring by
traders ahead of the New Year's weekend. Most U.S. commodity
markets will hold shortened sessions Monday and all will be closed
on New Year's Day.
   War fears also supported petroleum futures on the New York Merc,
although near-term heating oil futures weakened ahead of a National
Weather Service forecast for above-normal temperatures late next
week in the Northeast, the largest regional heating oil market.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 30 cents to 66 cents
higher with February at $27.57 a barrel; heating oil was 1.1 cents
lower to 1.27 cents higher with January at 79.78 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .92 cent to 1.27 cents higher with January at
69.56 cents a gallon; natural gas was 1.1 cent lower to 1.5 cents
higher with February at $1.95 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Copper futures rose sharply on the Commodity Exchange in
response to both the weaker dollar and rumors of a strike at a
large Chilean copper mine.
   Copper finished 1.8 cents to 3 cents higher with January at
$1.158 a pound.
   Orange juice futures settled 2.25 cents to 3 cents lower on the
New York Cotton Exchange with January at $1.135 a pound as the
market continued to seek a more realistic level after last week's
dramatic surge.
   Soybean futures prices fell moderately on the Chicago Board of
Trade, reflecting expectations for heavy deliveries Monday against
the January contract. Grain futures finished mostly lower.
   Wheat settled { cent to 3\ cents lower with March at $2.61} a
bushel; corn was unchanged to { cent lower with March at $2.32} a
bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent lower with March at $1.12} a
bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 6 cents lower with January at
$5.58 a bushel.
   Cattle futures drifted lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Pork futures were boosted by higher cash hog prices and
chart-inspired buying in pork bellies.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .40 cent lower with February at
77.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower
with January at 89.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with February at 49.02 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .15 cent to .48 cent higher with February at
63.30 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Co-founder of Longs Drug Store Chain Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WALNUT CREEK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph M. Long, chairman and
co-founder of Longs Drug Stores and a philanthropist who gave
millions of dollars to educational and environmental causes, has
died. He was 78.
   The California native, born in Covelo in Mendocino County, died
Thursday night at a Walnut Creek hospital, the company announced on
Friday.
   Long founded the retail drug store company in 1938 in Oakland
with his brother Thomas, a director of the Walnut Creek-based
company. Longs now has 14,000 employees working in 257 retail drug
stores in six states - California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado,
Alaska and Hawaii.
   In recent years, Joseph Long wasn't involved in the day-to-day
operations of the store chain. One of his four sons, Robert Long,

   Long donated millions of dollars to medical, education,
environmental and wildlife causes.
   He helped established the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory at
the University of California at Santa Cruz with an initial $1.5
million donation. He also gave $3.25 million to the University of
California at San Francisco Medical Center which named a wing of
its hospital after Long.
   Long also founded the California State Park Foundation, which
contributed money to wildlife and waterfowl organizations.
