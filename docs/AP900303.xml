<HEAD>Dogs and Mushers Set to Start Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seventy dog teams and mushers were set
to start the ``Last Great Race on Earth'' on Saturday, the grueling
1,100-mile-long Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome.
   Teams were expected to encounter some of the harshest weather in
the race's 18-year history, said Race Manager Jack Niggemyer.
   Sub-zero temperatures accompanied by strong winds, the heaviest
snowfall in a quarter-century, ash from Redoubt Volcano and
starving, aggressive moose have combined to make it a tough year to
race and a tough year to train, he said.
   ``Awful weather,'' Niggemyer said. ``It's probably snowed 40
inches in the last two days.''
   The race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days. The record time, set
by Susan Butcher of Manley, Alaska, in 1987, is 11 days, two hours
and five minutes. Butcher won the race in 1986, 1987 and 1988.
   Some participants and race observers said they expect this
year's race to be slow going because of the deep snow and
poorly-packed trail.
   ``We might run out of trail,'' said Lavon Barve, a musher from
Wasilla, Alaska. ``It's up to the mushers to snowshoe or
whatever,'' he said. It will be Barve's ninth race; he finished
fifth last year.
   The Iditarod began in 1973. It commemorates the 1925 emergency
delivery of diphtheria serum to Nome on the Bering Sea. The serum,
taken overland by sled dog because airplanes couldn't get through,
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote coastal
town.
   The trail begins in Anchorage and heads northwest across the
giant Alaska Range and onto the treeless tundra. Eventually it
winds along the Yukon River to the Bering Sea.
   Since 1973, the Iditarod has grown in fame and stature. This
year, mushers have come from as far as France and Switzerland.
Companies spend tens of thousands of dollars to sponsor top
competitors.
   Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, Alaska, the only person to win the
Iditarod four times, will be trying for a fifth win. Butcher will
attempt to equal Swenson's four-time win record.

<HEAD>Latvians Worry Voting Soviet Troops Will Distort Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latvians allege 70,000 Soviet troops are pouring
into the Baltic republics to skew the voting in the
independence-minded republics' elections in the coming weeks.
   A Soviet military commander indicated Friday that the troops are
coming into the Baltics from Czechoslovakia and won't be
transferred that quickly.
   Pro-independence activists are hoping to win majorities in the
parliamentary elections in Latvia and Estonia on March 18, but both
republics have substantial Russian populations who may vote against
independence candidates. A substantial influx of soldiers, who can
vote wherever they are stations, could change the balance of power.
   The Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia already
have heavy concentrations of troops, reportedly one out of every
eight people in Estonia.
   Lithuanians already have elected a majority of pro-independence
activists to their parliament and run-offs are scheduled.
   Baltics military commander Fyodor Kuzmin told the Latvian
legislature Friday that the Soviet troops being withdrawn from
Czechoslovakia will be transferred to the Baltics, though not
necessarily permanently, reported Anda Anspoka of the Latvian
People's Front.
   In his comments, Soviet commander Kuzmin reportedly gave no
timetable for the troops arriving in the Baltics. However, the
Soviets have told the Czechoslovaks they need 16 months to withdraw
all 73,500 soldiers because there is no housing for them and their
families in the Soviet Union, which has a chronic and severe
housing shortage.
   The first units, consisting of 22 T-62 tanks and 33 armored
vehicles, left Czechoslovakia on Monday.
   People's Front representative Janis Jurkama said on Finnish
television Friday that ``our information is that they are coming to
Latvia just before the elections'' and they would vote.
   ``I tell you people are being very nervous, and that is why a
lot of letters have been coming to the Supreme Soviet (legislature)
asking our deputies to express a very strong protest to Moscow,''
he said.
   Kuzmin told the Latvian legislature that the troops were going
to Lithuania and Estonia rather than Latvia, Anspoka said.
Disbelieving lawmakers decided to protest to Moscow and request
that no more troops be sent to the Baltics, she said.
   The Latvian legislature also passed a law removing judges from
the control of the Communist Party. A judgeship is now
``incompatible'' with membership in a political party, the official
Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The Latvian parliament also created a state bank empowered to
issue currency independent from the Soviet ruble, Tass said.

   The elderly communists, religious liberals
and social reformers at Sunset Hall are used to being outnumbered,
but there aren't enough left now even to keep the house open.
   Sunset Hall, a 36-room Spanish-style home for retired radicals,
is being sold for $1.2 million to a developer who wants to convert
it into an apartment complex, Ann Maupin, president of the board
governing the home, said Friday.
   Residents of the home, which is running an annual deficit, have
until March 22 to move out. Of the 14 residents, age 77 to 99,
eight have no place to go or don't want to go. The rest have made
other plans.
   ``It's the loss of a very important people's institution,'' said
Sadie Tomkin, 89, who once managed the communist newspaper People's
World.
   ``If this was a decent society, this would never have
happened,'' she said.
   Sunset Hall residents can count among their brethren former
resident Ruben Burroughs, editor of Upton Sinclair's newsletter
during the socialist's 1934 gubernatorial campaign. Others helped
form the union backbone for blue collar workers in the United
States in the 1930s and some fought McCarthy-era blacklisting in
the 1950s.
   Founded in 1924 by the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles,
Sunset Hall was designed to house religious liberals. The home is
funded primarily by residents' monthly fees and has operated at a
deficit for almost two decades, said administrator Thomas E.
Brandlin.
   It is expected to post an estimated $95,000 deficit this year,
its worst ever, he said.
   Residents pay between $900 and $1,400 a month, although some are
charged less because of need.
   ``We're almost broke,'' Brandlin said. ``A big chunk of money
might help for a while but what Sunset Hall really needs is to be
filled up with 30 paying residents.''
   ``We need enough residents to bring in $75,000 per year, or
fund-raising,'' added Mrs. Maupin. ``But that's fund-raising at a
very high level.''
   She said there are 12 members on the board that governs the
home, with two who want the home to remain open. The board is
elected by the 240 members of the Sunset Hall Nonprofit Corp.,
which is open to anyone who pays a $35 fee.
   To fight the closure, attorney Kent Ten Brink said he intends to
seek a court injunction blocking the planned sale.
   Residents, some who must use canes and walkers, have
participated in recent years in demonstrations in support of the
Los Angeles teachers' strike and a picket by Eastern Airline
workers.
   And they say they may fall back on a timeworn strategy and stage
a demonstration outside Sunset Hall, which features a large,
tree-shaded patio, a library and a living room equipped with a
grand piano, the day they get evicted.
   ``We have people here who expressed their thinking on world
events and took part in them,'' said Drusilla Falk. ``I'm about the
youngest here. I'm 78 and when I arrived here four years ago, I
thought maybe I won't have to make any more moves.''
   Waldemar Hille _ Wally to friends _ said the band of old rebels
is not taking news of the closing lying down.
   ``I'm a musician by trade and not accustomed to getting mad, but
we do have a lot of people here who are,'' said Hille, who plays
piano, organ and a little guitar when he's able.
   ``I'm going to try and keep my place here and quite a few other
members will too,'' he added, ``but we don't expect miracles.''
   The 82-year-old Hille used to accompany singer Paul Robeson and
was once a collaborator with folk singer Pete Seeger. He said he
moved to Sunset Hall about two years ago.
   Hille feared that without the intellectual stimulation provided
by the home, some residents may just fade away.
   ``As a musician I can write and practice my instruments,'' Hille
said. ``I can stay alive at least. Other people aren't as fortunate
as that and they have only to look forward to a single apartment
some place.''

   A nocturnal assailant in a ski

locks of their hair and fleeing.
   None of the women were injured in the attacks, but some were
threatened, said police. The attacks all were reported in the last
five months by women who had been walking alone at night.
   The most recent episode occurred Feb. 17. As in previous
attacks, the woman was unable to provide an accurate description of
the man because he wore dark clothing and a ski mask, police said.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black market currency dealers on their
sidewalk trading floor outside a train station are scrambling for
East German marks as the non-convertible currency soars against the
West's mighty deutsche mark.
   Germans from both countries and the region's
wheeling-and-dealing Poles who trade on the black market are facing
a run on the East German mark amid speculation over a pending
monetary union between the Germanys.
   Talks are under way on a plan to introduce the West German mark
as legal tender in East Germany, and some East German officials
have called for a 1-to-1 exchange rate at the outset.
   That proposal has brought a sudden switch at the sidewalk
trading spot.
   ``You can hardly get East marks these days _ it was a lot easier
only a week or two ago, although the exchange rate is a lot better
now for sellers,'' said one dealer, who identified himself only as
Harald K.
   The 24-year-old East German, who deals in West Berlin on his
days off from the army, said East Germans a month ago had to pay 20
East marks for one West mark.
   Now they can buy one shiny deutsche mark coin for only a green
5-East mark note.
   When East Germany's Communist government opened the Berlin Wall
in November, the boom in traffic between the nations boosted
business on the sidewalk exchange in front of the train stop at the
zoo in West Berlin.
   A few West Germans bought East marks to travel East and buy
cheap staples like rice, pasta and fresh meat, or dine like kings
at subsidized restaurants. But most customers were East Germans out
hunting for consumer goods unavailable back home.
   Now though, East marks are in demand and more West Germans are
buying in the hope of turning a quick profit when the nation's
economies are merged as part of a monetary union.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has proposed the union as a
first step to unification of the countries. Some West German
officials also say that East Germany's economy is crumbling and
will collapse without the union.
   ``People are expecting with a currency union, the East German
mark will be exchanged at a 1-to-1 rate,'' said Reinhard Pohl, a
monetary expert at West Berlin's German Economic Research Institute.
   Pohl said some West Germans are trading their convertible
deutsche marks at the favorable black market rate, then depositing
them with friends or relatives in the East and hoping for the
favorable exchange rate once economic union is announced.
   The East mark has surged 30 percent against the deutsche mark at
currency trading offices in West Berlin and Frankfurt, and in
Vienna, Austria, and Zurich, Switzerland.
   Uncertainty over how economic unification will be carried out
also has made West German stock and bond markets jumpy.
   ``The markets are being driven by emotion, speculation and
politics, and that's not going to change before the elections'' in
East Germany on March 18, said one Frankfurt bond trader, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   He said West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper had
contributed to the speculation Friday, with a report that East
German and West German finance officials have agreed to a currency
union by July 1.
   Bild said a joint currency commission had decided that East
Germans' savings _ which alone amount to 17 billion East marks in
bank accounts _ would be exchanged over an unspecified period of
time at a 1-to-1 rate.
   For savings that couldn't be swapped immediately, for lack of
ready cash, West German interest rates would be paid, Bild said.
   Only savings deposited in East German bank accounts before Jan.
1, or possibly before Nov. 9 _ when the Berlin wall was opened,
would be converted, it added.
   The paper said cash of up to 1,000 marks could probably be
exchanged at a 1-to-1 rate, but that larger amounts would be cashed
at a less favorable rate.
   The East German government declined to comment and the West
German Bundesbank denied the report, saying no decisions would be
made on the conversion rate before the election.

   Rock singer Billy Idol, who suffered a broken
leg and forearm in a motorcycle accident last month, has been
released from the hospital.
   Idol, 34, was released Friday from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
and will require a period of rehabilitation, hospital spokesman Ron
Wise said.
   The spike-haired singer suffered a compound fracture of his
right leg between the knee and ankle and a broken left forearm on
Feb. 6. He underwent several operations on his leg.
   Police said Idol ran a stop sign and hit a car while riding home
from a Hollywood studio where he had just completed work on the
album ``Charmed Life,'' which is scheduled for release April 17.

   Comedian Bob Newhart says he had fun making
``Newhart'' for the last eight years, but this year is the last for
the CBS situation comedy.
   ``Newhart,'' in which the comedian stars as an embattled
hotelier, will have its last broadcast in April. The 60-year-old
Newhart said that another year for the sitcom was scuttled by
demands made by MTM, the show's producers. He and CBS are in talks
to develop a new situation comedy.
   ``Our series was the perfect example of how much fun episodic
television can be,'' Newhart said.

   Soviet parliamentarian Boris Yeltsin
kicks off an international tour here next week to promote his book
``Against the Grain.'' Yeltsin arrives in Stockholm on Monday, the
worldwide publishing date for the book which promises rare insight
into the political games behind the Kremlin walls, said Inger
Sjoholm-Larsson, spokeswoman of publisher Forum AB.
   Sjoholm-Larsson said a first Swedish edition of 15,000 to 18,000
copies was being printed.
   Yeltsin, 58, is a member of the Congress of People's Deputies
and a deputy in the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Excerpts of ``Against the Grain'' have appeared in Swedish
papers. They described the privileged lives of the Soviet political
elite, and criticized Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for moving
too slowly in reforming Soviet society.
   Yeltsin will tour Norway, West Germany, Italy, France, the
Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States.

   Psychiatric social worker Sophie Freud,
granddaughter of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, says
she's never undergone psychoanalysis and doesn't plan to.
   ``I'm just the kind of addictive person who would get lost in
some kind of dependency relationship'' in analysis, she told about
200 people Friday at the University of Pittsburgh. ``It's too
dangerous to my psychic makeup.''
   Ms. Freud, 65, is a professor of social work at Simmons College
in Boston and a noted therapist.
   She poked fun at some of her grandfather's ideas, saying, for
example, that she doesn't agree with his contention that only men
are capable of true passion.
   ``Women love only themselves with an intensity comparable to
man's love for them'' her grandfather wrote in 1914. ``Nor does
their need lie in the direction of loving, but of being loved; and
that man finds favor with them who fulfills this condition.''
   That's ridiculous, Ms. Freud said.
   ``Sometimes, I question whether men are capable of love,'' she
joked before the predominantly female audience.

   Former model Hazel Diane Moore, who lured
Washington Mayor Marion Barry to a hotel where he was arrested on
drug charges, has been fined $927 for drunken driving and put on
probation for three years.
   Miss Moore, 38, who also goes by the name of Rasheeda Moore,
also was ordered Friday to enroll in an alcohol abuse education
program and had restrictions placed on her driver's license for 90
days.
   Miss Moore did not have to appear for the Van Nuys Municipal
Court proceeding and was not present when attorney Ronald J. Lewis
entered her no-contest plea to driving under the influence.
   The Burbank woman was arrested Jan. 1 at 11:30 p.m. for driving
under the influence of alcohol. Police said her blood alcohol level
was .12 percent. A driver is considered legally drunk in California
at .08 percent.
   Miss Moore became an undercover informant for the FBI, calling
the mayor to a Washington hotel room where he was arrested Jan. 18
for investigation of possessing cocaine.

   A teen-ager fleeing Cuba crossed most of
the hazardous Florida Straits on a windsurfer that an East German
tourist had given him, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
   Lester Moreno Perez, 17, was in good health after being picked
up by a Bahamian freighter about 30 miles south of Key West, Petty
Officer James Wentworth said Friday.
   The youth had begun the trip from Cuba 16 hours earlier, on
Thursday, and had sailed about 60 miles on the windsurfer before it
broke, Wentworth said.
   ``It wasn't a cheap windsurfer,'' he said. ``It was a nice one,
it wasn't homemade.''
   Moreno Perez told Coast Guard officers he was given the
Austrian-made, three-meter long surfboard by an East German tourist
who ``wanted him to have his freedom,'' said Petty Officer Richard
Rodriguez.
   The wishbone boom _ which the windsurfer holds while sailing _
broke in the early morning Friday, forcing Moreno Perez to rig up a
makeshift device, Rodriguez said.
   Moreno Perez, who told officials he has family in Miami, was
being questioned Friday by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
   Hundreds of Cuban refugees have attempted the dangerous passage
to the Florida Keys on homemade rafts, rickety boats or innertubes.
Many have died along the way.

<HEAD>Gershwin Comes to Life on Computer-Driven Player-Piano Rolls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using a computer-driven descendant of the player
piano, a music scholar gave new life to more than 100 rare George
Gershwin solos recorded on piano rolls.
   ``It is as if you are being treated to a live performance in
your living room,'' the scholar, Artis Wodehouse of San Francisco,
said Friday as she showed off the technology that saved the songs.
   Gershwin recorded the pieces on rolls for player pianos between
1916, when he was 17, and 1926. Player pianos were the jukeboxes of
their day, Wodehouse said, and most of the Gershwin performances
were his elaborate arrangements of then popular songs. Eighteen
were his original compositions.
   Sheet music for his compositions and for his arrangements of the
other pieces did not survive.
   Wodehouse, a pianist herself, found 105 of the 120 piano rolls
through a Michigan collector in 1988. She then found a computer
firm, Micro-W Distributors Inc. of Butler, N.J., that had developed
a technology that turns piano rolls into a format computers can
read.
   Micro-W put the Gershwin rolls on floppy disks that can be
played on synthesizers or a computer-driven update of the player
piano, the Yamaha Disklavier.
   On Friday, the Gershwin songs emanated from a Disklavier in a
performance at Yamaha's Communication Center in New York.
   Gershwin ``would love it,'' Wodehouse said. ``He would be
tickled with the technology. He was a great believer in the new.
And he would have been delighted to learn that people still cared
about his music.''
   Gershwin, one of America's greatest composers and a piano
virtuoso, died in 1937. His first big claim to fame came in 1919
with the release of ``Swanee,'' but his position in the annals of
music history was secured in 1924 by ``Rhapsody in Blue.''
   A few years ago, Wodehouse transcribed sheet music for several
old 78 rpm Gerswhin records. ``I went over and over them,'' she
said. ``It took about 150 hours to transcribe a three-minute
piece'' because his arrangements were so elaborate.
   When those pieces were published, she became well-known among
Gershwin lovers and about a year ago she won a National Endowment
for the Arts grant to study Gershwin piano rolls.
   Micro-W had just created a technology that could read the piano
rolls, which Wodehouse compares to long pieces of toilet paper with
little pin pricks in them. Player pianos read the rolls by blowing
air through the holes, triggering hammers inside the pianos.
   The computer data was made by taking pictures of images of light
aimed through the holes, and putting that data onto disks, she said.
   Wodehouse then persuaded the Coda Music Software Co. to adapt
its music transcription program Finale to transform the Micro-W
disks into sheet music. Seven of the original Gershwin compositions
found on the rolls are scheduled to be published by Warner Bros.,
she said.
   If all 18 of the Gershwin works are published, it will more than
double the existing Gershwin solo sheet-music repertoire, Wodehouse
said. Plans also are in the works to create recordings of the
Gerswhin rolls.
   Player pianos fell into disuse during the Depression, when they
were hacked up for scrap wood and replaced by record players.
   The Disklavier, which can be used as a conventional piano as
well as a mini-recording studio that will tape and recreate
whatever is played on it, ranges in price from $7,000 to $22,000.
The disks are sold by Micro-W.

<HEAD>Government Orders Open Skies for Handicapped, but Restricts Blind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is forcing airlines to open the
skies to the handicapped, but says blind people still can't sit
near the exit door.
   Transportation Department rules requiring more accommodations
for the disabled on airliners brought immediate criticism from an
airline industry trade group and from a national organization of
blind people. Both said they were considering lawsuits.
   The rules call for moveable aisle armrests and more space for
wheelchairs and require airlines to make other provisions for
handicapped travelers.
   Billed as an anti-discrimination measure required by Congress,
the rules will cost airlines an estimated $400 million over the
next 20 years _ for training personnel and modifying airliner
interior design to accommodate more disabled people, said Don
Trilling, DOT director for regulatory affairs.
   ``You don't treat handicapped passengers differently or force
restrictions on them unless you have a very good safety grounds for
doing it,'' said Bob Ashby, a department lawyer who briefed news
media on the directives that will take effect in about five weeks.
   All new airliners with more than 30 seats will be required to
have moveable armrests on half the aisle seats, and wide-body
planes _ generally those carrying 200 passengers or more _ must
have at least one lavatory that can accommodate a handicapped
passenger.
   The rules also strictly limit airlines' ability to refuse
service to handicapped people, prohibit any restriction on where
they can sit except for safety reasons and prevent airlines from
requiring handicapped passengers to be accompanied by an attendant.
If they do require it, the airline must fly the attendant free.
   ``These regulations will ensure that U.S. air carriers provide
consistent, predictable service to disabled travelers, without
discrimination and with accommodations the passengers need,'' said
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner. ``The regulations
accomplish this goal consistent with the safety of all passengers.''
   The Air Transport Association, which represents U.S. carriers,
said the requirements would ``diminish safety and service for air
travelers and impose an unacceptable economic burden on the
airlines and all their customers.''
   The trade group said requiring 50 percent moveable aisle
armrests was ``way out of proportion with the real need to
accommodate disabled passengers.''
   Another provision that would give both manual and electric
wheelchairs priority in main cabin storage areas will ``seriously
diminish storage space for carry-on items of other passengers,''
ATA said.
   Airliners built in 1992 or later will be affected, and older
aircraft will have to comply as their interiors are refurbished,
usually about every seven years.
   The rules prohibit carriers from restricting seating on the
basis of handicap except to comply with Federal Aviation
Administration safety regulations.
   An accompanying FAA rule limits seating in exit rows to
passengers who can locate the door quickly, follow instructions for
its use, physically open the heavy doors, determine whether it's
safe to go out, understand both verbal and hand-signalled
instructions from flight attendants, and get around obstacles to
lead other passengers off the aircraft.
   Tony Broderick, FAA associate administrator, said the rule was
reached ``reluctantly'' but ``does not single out any group.''
   He said among those prohibited would be parents with small
children, people too frail to operate the door, passengers with
broken legs or other disabilities that would inhibit movement,
obese people and children under 15, as well as people who are blind.
   Marc Maurer, spokesman for the National Federation of the Blind,
said the rule ``continues a pattern of discrimination the
Department of Transportation has permitted airlines to carry on for
some time.''
   A bill is pending in Congress that would allow blind people to
sit wherever they want on airliners. Maurer said the group is also
considering legal action.
   ``Blind people don't need anything in these rules, except to be
left alone,'' Maurer said.

   An explorer on a dog sled trek across
Antarctica disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours, as foul weather
threatened the team's plan to finish the first non-mechanized
crossing of the continent by Saturday.
   Keizo Funatsu, the Japanese member of the six-man international
team, was found early Friday after surviving a night of 70 mph
winds and 20-below temperatures by burrowing into the snow.
   ``When he was found, he was yelling, `I'm alive.' He was found
in very good condition,'' said Jennifer Gasperini, headquarters
spokeswoman for the Minnesota-based expedition.
   Funatsu disappeared Thursday after meeting with a French film
crew that hauled a mobile home to the team's campsite, 16 miles
from their goal. Team members roped themselves together and
searched for six hours. They gave up because of darkness, but found
him in the morning after a two-hour search, Ms. Gasperini said.
   It wasn't known if Funatsu would be able to complete the last 16
miles of the trek to the Soviet scientific station at Mirnyy, on
the eastern Antarctic coast, under his own power.
   The 1990 Trans-Antarctica Expedition was stalled for a second
day Friday on the last leg of a 3,800-mile, seven-month journey by
dogsled and skis from western Antarctica to the eastern coast on
the Indian Ocean.
   The wind dropped to 30 mph Friday afternoon, but conditions
remained too hazardous to risk a final push, Ms. Gasperini said.
Especially dangerous was a maze of ice crevasses along the route.
   They had hoped to end the $11 million, corporate-sponsored
journey by 6 a.m. EST Saturday at Mirnyy, where they planned to
meet television crews.
   The expedition, led by Will Steger of Ely, Minn., and Jean-Louis
Etienne of France, hopes to parlay interest in the feat into public
support for preservation of Antarctica, and to lobby world leaders
who are reviewing the 1961 Antarctic Treaty.
   Team members reached the South Pole _ the halfway mark of their
journey _ on Dec. 11 to become the first to reach the bottom of the
world by dogsled since Roald Amundsen discovered the Pole in 1911.

<HEAD>Panel's Plan Would Provide Insurance for All</HEAD>

   A bipartisan commission's plan to overhaul the
nation's health care system would provide private or public
insurance coverage to all Americans, regardless of whether they can
afford it.
   However, the plan already is drawing fire for failing to say how
the $65 billion annual bill would be paid by taxpayers.
   The proposals adopted Friday by the U.S. Bipartisan Commission
on Comprehensive Health Care are aimed at providing universal
access to health care and assuring that the elderly and disabled
will be able to receive care _ at home or in nursing homes.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chairman of the commission, said
the recommendations to Congress respond to a crisis in U.S. health
care that leaves more than 31 million people without any health
insurance and an additional 20 million with inadequate coverage.
   He called it ``wrong, outrageous, morally repugnant'' that
Americans are denied care in emergencies.
   ``We can't offer easy answers, but we can offer a challenge to
this country,'' he said.
   The panel voted 8-7 for the plan to achieve universal access,
and 11-4 for the long-term care plan. The three members appointed
by President Bush divided 2-1 in favor of both proposals. The other
12 members of the commission are members of Congress.
   The commission's plan relies on both increased federal spending
for health care coverage, including a federal takeover of the
Medicaid system now shared with the states, and private coverage.
   In addition to its estimated $66.2 billion cost, an additional
$20 billion would be paid by private businesses through increased
contributions to employee health plans, or to the public plan.
   ``Without a way to pay for it, it is a non-starter. It is
legislatively dead,'' said Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., a
member of the panel and chairman of the House subcommittee on
health.
   He criticized the Bush administration for failing to provide
leadership in finding a way to provide health insurance.
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., also a member, said the plan
failed to provide any restraints on health care costs.
   ``It's going to skyrocket our costs,'' he said.
   Rockefeller said the plan would need a revenue source that could
be counted on to increase by 8 percent to 9 percent a year
automatically, because of anticipated rising costs.
   The plan would be phased in over five years. In its first year,
health care coverage would be extended to all children and pregnant
women.
   The plan would require all businesses with more than 100
employees to provide private health insurance to their workers, or
to contribute to a public plan for employees and non-working
dependents.
   Smaller businesses would be encouraged to provide insurance
through tax credits and subsidies, but might eventually be required
to provide coverage if they did not meet targets by the end of the
five-year period.
   The long-term care plan would pay the full cost of the first
three months in a nursing home by anyone, regardless of income.
Benefits for additional time in a nursing home would be improved,
permitting recipients to keep their homes and certain other assets.
   The commission was created in 1988 when Congress voted to expand
Medicare catastrophic care coverage. That coverage was repealed
last year after groups representing the elderly abandoned their
support, complaining about the cost.
   The commission was called the Pepper Commission for its first
chairman, the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla. It was directed to
recommend ways to assure health care and how to pay for it.

<TEXT>
   The new United National Opposition
government is planning to turn land seized by the leftist
Sandinistas over to those working it and compensate the previous
owners, UNO officials said.
   Confiscated land now idle will be rented and priority will be
given to its previous owners, said Francisco Mayorga, a senior
economic adviser to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   Mayorga told reporters Friday that 40 percent of the nation's
2.5 million arable acres is owned by the Ministry of Agrarian
Reform.
   People now working that land will get title to it, Mayorga said,
adding that former owners will be compensated with government bonds
based on pre-confiscation tax values _ something that may be
painful for owners who deliberately undervalued their land.
   ``We aren't going to throw anybody out of their homes,'' said
another adviser, Alfredo Cesar. ``The person affected will have to
petition through mechanisms we will establish.''
   Land ownership is one of the key issues during the transition
between the Sandinistas and Mrs. Chamorro's coalition, which
defeated them Sunday and will take office April 25.
   After ousting dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, the leftist
Sandinistas began nationalizing businesses and expropriating huge
private farms and ranches as part of a land redistribution plan.
   UNO campaigned on a free-market platform that proposed selling
off state enterprises and increasing private ownership to spur the
ailing economy. The Sandinistas _ who still control the army and
police _ said firing public workers or making the banking system
private could endanger the transition.
   Mayorga, heading Monday to the United States to seek assistance,
said the government would have to move fast to help farmers plant
crops before the May rains.
   He said the nation would need $500 million to $600 million in
annual aid from all sources, about what the same as it was
receiving under President Daniel Ortega.
   The bulk of that aid, however, came from Eastern Europe, Cuba
and the Soviet Union, sources which were drying up even before the
UNO victory.
   Also Friday, a Honduran official joined talks got under way to
discuss disbanding U.S.-supported Contra rebels who are based in
Honduras. A source close to the talks said the discussions were
``constructive'' but that there was a long way to go.
   Both the Sandinistas and UNO have urged the Contras to
immeditately dismantle their bases and return, but the Contras said
must have talks first with Mrs. Chamorro's government to guarantee
their safety.
   Honduras' new president, Rafael Leonardo Callejas, wants the
Contras out of his nation's territory and peace established in the
region in order to attract foreign investment and get his economy
back in gear.
   ``Every day that goes by that they are not dismantled the
situation becomes more explosive because it is interfering with the
normal transition,'' said Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of
the Foreign Ministry, in an interview with reporters Friday.
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Chamorro said that transition negotiations
overall were going smoothly.
   ``It's all going peacefully, very peacefully,'' Mrs. Chamorro
said in a brief interview.
   Bendana said the Sandinistas would turn over full powers of the
executive to Mrs. Chamorro.
   Transition talks are focusing on control of the Sandinista army
and Interior Ministry security forces, which the Sandinistas don't
want to reduce until the Contras disband.
   Including the army, security and militias, those forces are
about 150,000 strong; UNO wants to reduce them sharply and
eliminate the draft.
   That position was already enticing some soldiers to desert in
anticipation of Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   When asked why there was negotiation if the Sandinistas were
willing to give up control, Bendana said that was part of the
political process.
   ``Yes, you're going to have a tug of interests, but that's what
democracy is all about,'' said Bendana.
   Despite the Sandinista leadership's conciliatory attitude,
discontent continued to appear at lower levels of the party.
   Outside the city of Masaya, 17 miles southeast of Managua, a
group of at least a dozen armed men occupied an abandoned stone
fort once used as a prison by Somoza.
   At another location near Masaya, the head of a seized operation
that grows a variety of crops and gins cotton said workers there
would not give the business up to private ownership.
   Esteban Correa, a Sandinista loyalist who manages the operation,
said he had 50 rifles and was asking the party for more.

   Here are key points in the Pepper Commission's
recommendations for health care.
   The recommendations fall into two areas, access to health care,
and long-term care.
   ACCESS&equals;
   _Businesses with 100 or fewer employees would be encouraged to
provide health insurance for their employees and non-working
dependents. Tax credits and subsidies would be available, and
self-employed and unincorporated businesses could deduct 100
percent of premiums.
   Employers who buy coverage and achieve a specified coverage
target would not be required to participate in the federal public
health insurance plan.
   _All businesses with more than 100 employees must provide
private health insurance, for a specified package of benefits, or
contribute to the public plan for all employees and non-working
dependents.
   _The public plan would cover employees and dependents that
contribute and non-working individuals who buy in or are
subsidized. It would replace Medicaid and pay providers according
to Medicare rules. It would be financed and administered primarily
by the federal government, although states could opt to administer
it.
   _The minimum benefit package includes primary and preventive
care, physician and hospital care and other services. There would
be cost-sharing, with subsidies for low-income people and limits on
out-of-pocket spending.
   _At full implementation, all Americans would be required to have
health insurance through their employer or the public plan.
   _The plan contains a provision that could require the secretary
of health and human services to submit to Congress a plan for
insuring any remaining uninsured employees of small companies after
five years.
   LONG-TERM&equals;
   _Severely disabled people of all ages would be eligible for
social insurance for home and community-based care.
   _A nursing home program would be established providing
protection so that no one must be impoverished before receiving
covered long-term care. Individuals could keep their homes and
$30,000 in assets _ couples could keep up to $60,000.
   _The federal and state governments would share financial
responsibility for the nursing home program. The federal government
would finance the home and community-based care program and the
first three months of care.
   _States are responsible for cost containment, quality assurance
and consumer protection.
   _Private long-term care insurance fills gaps not covered by the
plan, subject to government standards.

   Don Simpson did some quick soul searching
after finding a wallet containing $1,900 in an Interstate 44

   ``I heard the ol' devil saying, `Take it,' but I just couldn't

   Simpson, 47, found the money last week while cleaning the men's
room at a rest stop west of Joplin in southwestern Missouri. He
turned the wallet containing 18 $100 bills and two $50s over to
Linda Dewitz, his supervisor at Joplin Workshops Inc.
   The wallet contained no identification other than a bank slip
from Boatmen's Bank of Carthage. The bank tracked down the owner,
who asked not to be identified, and Mrs. Dewitz returned the money
to him.
   ``He was crying,'' she said. ``He had taken the money out to pay
a lawyer in another state over a probate deal. He said, `There's
just not honest people like this left in the world.' He said we
were angels sent. He was overjoyed.''
   Not too overjoyed: He gave Simpson and Mrs. Dewitz each a $25
reward.

   With a little help from the Georgia
College basketball team, police have returned an old barber pole to
its rightful place.
   After a weeklong absence, the rotating barber pole that has
twirled outside the Ideal Barber Shop since the early 1930s is once
again on display.
   The pole, about 3 feet tall, was ripped from the wall outside
the barber shop last week, apparently by college pranksters in this
central Georgia town.
   Ken Vance, Georgia College police chief, said he recovered the
pole with the help of several members of the college basketball
team who have their hair cut at the shop. ``They were pretty
incensed,'' he said.
   Vance said he had obtained ``a good idea who did it,'' and left
word he wanted the pole back. It was returned undamaged.
   ``It's just like an old buddy of mine come home,'' shop owner
James Wooten said Friday.

   Irreplaceable scientific information from U.S.
space missions is in danger because of the ``deplorable''
conditions in which NASA allows hundreds of thousands of magnetic
tapes to be stored, a congressional agency says.
   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress that audits
the performance of federal agencies, said Friday that investigators
found tapes in dusty hallways and in a basement where some had been
partially submerged by a flood.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in a letter
signed by John E. O'Brien, assistant deputy administrator, told the
GAO, ``We take ... strong exception to the implication that NASA is
not safeguarding the space science data as a national resources for
future generations.
   ``We believe that the tone of the report is unnecessarily harsh
and contains sweeping generalizations and extrapolations which we
believe to be unfounded and unsubstantiated,'' O'Brien said.
   NASA said it had experienced ``no significant loss of scientific
data as identified by our science customers.'' It also said its own
testing has shown ``a more than satisfactory preservation of data.''
   The GAO in turn rejected NASA's criticism and said there was
reason for concern that data stored on the tapes is ``at serious
risk of becoming partially or completely unusable.''
   The congressional monitors said they had visited 10 tape storage
and processing facilities and had found that eight failed to comply
with at least two of the regulations established by the National
Archives and Records Administration for the handling of magnetic
tapes.
   In a summary of its findings, the GAO said, ``Hundreds of
thousands of tapes containing space science data are stored under
deplorable conditions.''
   Five of the facilities lacked ``adequate temperature and
humidity control, fire protection, water protection or tape
maintenance,'' the congressional agency said.
   ``In some instances, GAO found tapes stored in hallways,
basements, and dusty warehouses not designed for tape storage. For
example, in one major facility, GAO found nearly 300,000 tapes
packed in boxes covered by dust and stacked on shipping pallets.''
   In one place, the agency said, it found more than 4,000 tapes
stored in a dirty basement that had been flooded in 1985,
submerging approximately half of some of the tapes and leaving a
film of debris on them.
   The GAO said that ``some of the most significant tape management
deficiencies'' were found in the two largest facilities: the
National Space Science Data Center at the Goddard Space Flight
Center in Greenbelt, Md., which stores more than 113,000 magnetic
tapes; and the Tape Staging and Storage Facility in Landover, Md.,
which stores and tracks more than 860,000 tapes.
   By contrast, the agency said the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS
Data Center in Sioux Falls, S.D., and the Digital Equipment Corp.'s
Data Protection Services in Dominguez Hills, Calif., were in full
or partial compliance with federal standards and industry
guidelines.
   Other facilities visited were the National Archives' Los Angeles
Federal Records Center in Laguna Niguel, Calif., and its Washington
National Records Center; the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,
Washington; the Multi-Mission Image Processing facility of the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory and the Infrared Processing and Analysis
Center of the California Institute of Technology, both in Pasadena,
Calif.; and the Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences of the
University of California at San Diego in La Jolla, Calif.

<HEAD>Council Says U.S. Should Explore Use of Nuclear Power in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Space explorers will have to use nuclear power
on Mars, and the National Science Council says the United States
should study employing nuclear rockets to get travelers to the
planet.
   In a Friday report to Vice President Dan Quayle, the council
acknowledged ``formidable barriers of public acceptance'' to the
use of nuclear power in space.
   However, it said the use of such power ``eventually will be
essential'' on both the Moon and Mars because of heavy energy
demands.
   It also recommended testing and possibly a demonstration in
space of the feasibility of sending rockets to Mars by nuclear
propulsion.
   The report analyzed a study done by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration as part of President Bush's initiative to put
bases on the Moon and Mars early in the next century.
   Among its findings:
   _NASA needs to study the effects of long-term space flight on
human beings because on the basis of present knowledge ``a
multiyear exposure to weightlessness, even with on-board exercise
and countermeasures and an intermediate stay on the surface of
Mars, presents unacceptable risks to the crew.''
   _Operation of a U.S. space station by the late 1990s as
scheduled is a ``reasonable assumption,'' but plans for the station
are not adequate for a Moon-Mars mission. The station ``may not be
the most appropriate staging base for the Moon and Mars'' and it is
possible that ``an additional station ... will eventually become
necessary.''
   _Although the NASA proposals envision bases on Mars, ``it
appears that a station in Mars orbit requires a less demanding
infrastructure than a surface base and might serve a useful purpose
in the early stages of human space exploration.''
   _Possibilities for international cooperation should be explored
because breakthroughs have been made in Europe, Japan and elsewhere
and ``most importantly, the USSR has substantial relevant
capability, demonstrated continued interest in Mars, and an
apparent strong desire for cooperation with the U.S. in Mars
exploration.''
   The council's study, made by a 14-member committee named in
January, said nuclear rockets would reach Mars in one-half to
one-third the time needed for single-stage chemical propulsion
systems. Unmanned spacecraft have made the 111 million mile voyage
to Mars in six months.
   ``The use of nuclear technology in space faces formidable
barriers of public acceptance, however, especially if employed in
Earth orbit,'' the council said. ``Therefore, issues of safety are
paramount in research and development.''
   It said one type of nuclear technology, known as the NERVA
class, ``is available for full-scale development'' and ``should be
evaluated for injection to Mars in competition with hydrogen-oxygen
chemical systems.''
   ``If careful systems studies ... show a significant advantage
for nuclear rockets in trip time or in weight to orbit, an in-space
demonstration of this technology should be done as soon as
possible,'' the council said.
   ``It will not be feasible to select the nuclear rocket as a
baseline in a system architecture until such a demonstration has
been conducted.''
   After announcing the Moon-Mars initiative July 20, the 20th
anniversary of the first Moon landing, Bush asked Quayle, chairman
of the National Space Council, to explore ways of carrying it out.
   NASA made a 90-day study, and Quayle asked the National Research
Council, an arm of the congressionally chartered National Academy
of Sciences, to evaluate it.

   City leaders had hoped a street named
after slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. would foster
feelings of hope and pride, but now they worry the backlash will
sully Portland's image.
   The street name has been met with an organized opposition led by
a conservative political veteran. A white supremacist leader joined
the opponents, and they collected 52,435 signatures on a ballot
initiative to reverse the name change.
   A judge nixed their drive on Wednesday, but the opponents
appealed Friday with the Oregon Supreme Court in hopes of meeting a
March 15 deadline to put the initiative on the May 15 primary
ballot.
   A civic leader says that the controversy, combined with the 1988
beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant by a group of neo-Nazi
``skinheads,'' may give blacks second thoughts about moving to the
city. Three men have received long prison sentences for the beating
death.
   ``Unfortunately, I think the city is going to take a bad rap
over this, particularly as we try to attract other people of color
to Portland,'' said Bernie Foster, a member of a citizens'
committee that recommended the King street name. ``You have to ask
what kind of message are we sending.''
   If the story has a familiar ring, it is because the same drama
has been played out in Seattle, San Diego, and Austin, Texas.
   In Seattle, a 1983 decision to rename a street Martin Luther
King Way was upheld by the Washington Supreme Court.
   In San Diego, voters decided to strip King's name from a major
street and return to the former name of Market Street. And in
Austin, a court decision to overturn a 1975 street name change was
upheld by a municipal appeals court. The King name was adopted in a
separate action a year later.
   Portland's Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard is a 7-mile street
on the city's east side formerly known as Union Avenue. It is a
thoroughfare notorious for crime and prostitution.
   The citizens committee that recommended the name change hoped it
would symbolize hope, stimulate pride and eventually lead to the
street's revitalization.
   The City Council voted unanimously to approve the name change
last April. Mayor Bud Clark was among the supporters.
   But when city officials and black leaders celebrated the name
change last summer, Rosalie Huss and two dozen others picketed the
crowd and heckled speakers.
   ``The City Council made a big mistake,'' Mrs. Huss told
reporters, ``and they will probably have to pay for it with egg on
their faces.''
   Mrs. Huss, the executive director of the Citizens for Union
Avenue campaign, maintains the name change was forced on an
unwilling public.
   Two separate polls showed voters were leaning 2-1 in favor of
the initiative, which was to have appeared on the May 15 primary
ballot.
   John Baxter, treasurer of Citizens for Union Avenue, is another
leading opponent of the King street name. He compares King to Betty
Crocker.
   ``She was not a real person either,'' Baxter says.
   Mrs. Huss, who owns no property and has no business interests on
the street, says her only stake is that of a concerned citizen.
   She and her husband, Walter, however, have a history of
opposition to the civil rights leader that stretches back 30 years.
In the 1960s, the Husses published a right-wing newspaper that
frequently linked King's activities to communist causes.
   Huss denies any implication that her grass-roots campaign is
racially motivated. She also says her group neither sought nor
welcomed the support of Nationalist Movement leader Richard
Barrett, a white supremacist who visited Portland last month to
campaign for Union Avenue.
   The legal issue in Portland was whether the City Council action
had been legislative _ setting policy _ or administrative,
implementing a policy already in place.
   Multnomah County Circuit Judge Harl Haas agreed with King
Boulevard supporters that the council's decision was
administrative. Only legislative decisions are subject to
initiative review under Oregon law.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Investigating Durenberger Appearances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee says it's
investigating more than 100 paid appearances by Sen. Dave
Durenberger in 1985-86, along with ``gifts of limousine service''
valued at nearly $5,000.
   A committee letter to the Minnesota Republican, released Friday,
disclosed new details of an investigation into Durenberger's book
promotion deal and the limousine trips.
   The committee voted last week to hold trial-like proceedings to
determine whether Senate rules were violated by Durenberger, or
whether any of his actions should be referred to the Justice
Department for a criminal investigation.
   The panel's letter was a formal notice of the action and a
statement of possible violations, a notice required by committee
rules.
   ``I will continue to cooperate fully with the committee and will
present evidence demonstrating that there was no intent on my part
to violate or circumvent Senate rules,'' Durenberger said after
receiving the letter.
   The committee revealed for the first time it is investigating
113 paid appearances by Durenberger in 1985-86 _ described by the
senator as book promotions that should not have counted toward the
Senate's outside income limits. Durenberger said his purpose was to
sell his books on defense and health issues.
   Durenberger ``may have violated'' two federal laws, the
committee said, when he arranged to charge fees for his speeches,
give the money to his publisher and have the publisher pay him
$100,000. The arrangement was not counted in the outside income
limits.
   Some of the organizations that invited Durenberger to speak said
they considered the appearances standard speeches by a senator, and
that book sales were not mentioned. Paid speeches by senators in
their official capacities are counted toward the outside earnings
limits, which have changed over the years.
   The committee letter said Durenberger ``may have violated''
Senate rules _ and the Ethics In Government Act _ ``by failing to
disclose in a timely fashion'' the travel expense reimbursements he
received from 43 appearances. The committee previously had not
disclosed the number of reimbursements under investigation.
   Durenberger amended his annual financial disclosure forms in
July to include the reimbursement information on what he called
book promotion appearances. He took the action only after the
committee's investigation was under way.
   Durenberger may have violated Senate rules, the committee said,
by ``accepting gifts of limousine service'' on 21 occasions in
1985-86 for a value of $4,935. Durenberger has said the limousines,
provided by private organizations, shuttled him between official
appearances in Boston and his marriage counselor in Concord, Mass.
   The committee had not previously revealed the number or value of
the limousine trips.
   The panel said it's investigating ``whether you may have
converted a campaign contribution to your personal use'' in
violation of Senate rules, and ``failed to report and deposit'' the
$5,000 donation in violation of federal law.
   The letter revealed, for the first time, the check was written
by the Pathology Practice Association Federal Political Action
Committee, and dated Dec. 30, 1986.
   The committee also said Durenberger may have violated federal
law ``by giving speeches in the U.S. Capitol and Senate
facilities'' to promote his books. The panel, for the first time,
said Durenberger brought in $6,250 from the speeches _ which took
place on six occasions between March and November, 1985.
   The panel also said it is investigating generally whether
Durenberger engaged in improper conduct that may reflect upon the
Senate.

<HEAD>Baker Seeks to Smooth Over Differences With Shamir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With tempers rising in Israel, the State
Department is trying to smooth over a dispute with Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir about the settlement of Soviet Jewish refugees on
the predominantly Arab West Bank and in Gaza.
   But diplomatic sources familiar with Israel's views said Friday
that differences over a $400 million U.S. loan guarantee and
Baker's giving ``a clean bill of health'' to the Palestine
Liberation Organization on terrorism could make it very difficult
for Shamir to agree to opening Mideast negotiations.
   The sources, declining to be identified, said Shamir had been
prepared to recommend the Israeli government approve in principle a
three-way meeting among Baker and the Egyptian and Israeli foreign
ministers. But now, the sources said, that would be ``almost
impossible.''
   Shamir is due to meet with leaders of his governing Likud
political coalition tonight and with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens,
Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on
Sunday.
   The sessions are critical to Baker's five-month drive to launch
negotiations by meeting here with Arens and Egyptian Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid and then having Israelis meet with
Palestinians in Cairo.
   ``Obviously there are some tough decisions that have to be
made,'' said Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman. ``We hope that we will be able to take the next step
to implement the prime minister's initiative.''
   She referred to Shamir's plan for elections among the 1.4
million to 1.7 million Palestinians who live on the West Bank and
in Gaza. The winners would negotiate with Israel a trial period of
limited self-rule to be followed by broader talks on an overall
agreement five years later.
   Baker has endorsed the plan as a starting point for
negotiations. However, he has been stymied by a dispute between
Israel and Egypt over the composition of the Palestinian delegation
and the agenda for the Cairo meeting.
   On Thursday, testifying before a House subcommittee, Baker took
two steps that stirred controversy in Jerusalem.
   He said the Bush administration could not extend a $400 million
guaranteed loan to Israel for housing for Soviet Jewish refugees if
they were settled on the West Bank or in Gaza, as about 100 of the
thousands of new immigrants have been.
   Also, Baker said he was satisfied that PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat was adhering to his December 1988 renunciation of terrorism
against Israel. Baker said there was no evidence of Arafat's
complicity or acquiescence in terrorism since then.
   The pledge and Arafat's acknowledgement of Israel's existence
prompted the Reagan administration to open talks with the PLO in
Tunisia.
   In the ensuing furor in Israel over Baker's testimony, the State
Department on Friday emphasized Baker's support for the Shamir plan
and for Jewish emigration.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Baker had called Shamir late in the afternoon
_ after testifying _ to underscore that the Shamir plan was the
centerpiece of U.S. diplomacy on the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   However, the U.S. official reiterated that the U.S. loan
guarantee, which is in addition to $3 billion in annual U.S. aid to
Israel, depended on ``some assurances'' the housing would not be
used by Soviet Jews settled on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Asked about Shamir's reply, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``I cannot
characterize for you that the secretary has received assurances.''
   But she said ``there was no indication'' in the conversation
that the prime minister was unhappy with the testimony. Ms.
Tutwiler said Baker had decided to call Shamir on Wednesday and it
``had nothing to do with his testimony.''
   Trying to accentuate the positive, Ms. Tutwiler said ``the prime
minister once again thanked Secretary Baker for all of his tireless
efforts and the amount of time he has devoted'' to trying to
implement Shamir's plan.
   Yossi Ahimeir, an aide to Shamir, confirmed in Jerusalem there
was a call from Baker, but disagreed with Ms. Tutwiler's
description.
   ``The prime minister expressed his resentment about the
connection Baker made between immigration and settlement,'' he
said. ``There was a long talk about the whole issue.''
   Ahimeir would not elaborate.
   On a related issue, the State Department late Friday criticized
Israel for requiring that all material on immigration of Soviet
Jews be submitted to the military censor before publication.
   ``Our position on freedom of the press and censorship is
well-known,'' the department said in a statement. ``We are
inquiring further into the details.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional panels that strongly criticize
the Navy's conclusion that Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig likely set
off the USS Iowa explosion fault the service for reaching a tenuous
hypothesis.
   The Navy's finding of a cause for the April 19 explosion that
killed 47 sailors, including Hartwig, ``is based on evidence
inadequate to support the conclusion,'' the panels said in a
48-page report released Friday.
   The two groups within the House Armed Services Committee _ the
Investigations Subcommittee and Defense Policy Panel _ cited what
lawmakers said were four major flaws in the Navy inquiry: the
structure of the investigation, technical tests, police work and
psychological analysis.
   ``By the standards of this subcommittee _ and the standards that
we think should have been applied in the Navy's investigation _
there is only a hypothesis, and a tenuous one at that,'' the report
said.
   The Navy concluded in its September report that Hartwig ``most
likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   Navy officials acknowledged then that their evidence was
circumstantial since Hartwig and all the witnesses were killed.
   The Navy said in statement Friday that it ``stands by its
conclusion that the explosion ... was the result of the wrongful,
intentional act most probably'' committed by Hartwig.
   ``This conclusion was reached after an intensive investigation
during which the Navy conducted more than 20,000 technical tests
and ruled out possible accidental causes including mechanical
failure, friction, propellant instability and personnel error,''
the Navy said.
   Ellis Rubin, a Miami lawyer representing former Gunner's Mate
Kendall Truitt, who was linked to the blast in several news
reports, said Truitt's family was ``gratified an official agency of
the government has cleared up this matter.''
   Truitt was the beneficiary of Hartwig's insurance policy.
   ``Congress is finally ruling on what we've known all along,''
Truitt said from the restaurant where he works in Land O'Lakes,
Fla. ``Thank God for objective congressmen.''
   The new report, ``USS Iowa Tragedy: An Investigative Failure,''
summarizes many of the complaints House members raised in December
during three days of hearings into the explosion.
   ``The only thing more tragic than the deaths of the 47 young
seamen last April was the Navy's failure to conduct a proper
investigation of the event,'' Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass.,
chairman of the investigations subcommittee, said in a statement
issued with the report's release.
   The congressional report faulted the Navy for conducting a
one-man inquiry and never upgrading to a board of investigators
when it became clear that the explosion cause might have been
criminal, not technical.
   In addition, it wasn't until May 8 _ nearly three weeks after
the blast _ that the Naval Investigative Service focused on the
possibility of a criminal act, the report said.
   ``At this time ... NIS was faced with a contaminated crime
scene, no chain of custody for evidence and a virtual inability to
conduct a proper criminal inquiry from an evidentiary standpoint,''
the report said.
   The congressional report also questioned the Navy's selective
use of information from the FBI.
   The service asked the FBI to corroborate the findings of the
Navy's technical team regarding the possibility a timing device
caused the blast. But when the FBI was unable to back up that
finding, the Navy did not use the report, deemed it inconclusive
and told the FBI that additional tests were unnecessary, the
congressional report said.
   At the same time, the panels attacked the psychological analysis
conducted by the FBI and cited the assessment of 10 of 14 experts
the subcommittees consulted who determined that the FBI analysis
was invalid.
   Three FBI psychologists testified in December that Hartwig _
based on his letters, interviews with the seaman's family and
friends and his personal history _ was ``egocentric, shy ... not
sufficiently aggressive, had a low self-esteem,'' that added up to
a suicidal loner.

<HEAD>Newest Kohl Stance On Border Issue Gets Sharp Reaction from Poles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl proposed a
treaty guaranteeing Poland's western border if the Warsaw
government confirms German minority rights and a 1953 renunciation
of war reparations.
   Poland's prime minister responded by saying he is ``astonished''
by the demands.
   While Kohl's offer Friday was apparently intended to defuse
domestic and international criticism over the borders of a single
Germany, Polish officials said it only broadened the dispute over
unification.
   Facing close elections in December, Kohl has tried to appease a
minority of West German voters who want to lay claim to some or all
of Germany's prewar borders, which would encompass one-third of
modern-day Poland.
   On Friday, demonstrators in Warsaw marched for a second day in
support of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's demand that Poland
take part in international talks on a unified Germany.
Demonstrations were held in six cities Thursday.
   Mazowiecki told West German television Friday night:
   ``This hour which is very important for the Germans, the hour of
the reunification process, is not just a German hour. It it is an
hour of Europe, of Germany's neighbors.''
   Earlier Friday, Kohl's government offered an eventual treaty
guaranteeing Poland's western border after German unification but
linked it to confirmation of Poland's 1953 decision not to seek war
reparations.
   Such a treaty also would be tied to reassurances of Poland's
pledge to protect the rights of its German minority, said West
German government spokesman Dieter Vogel.
   Kohl has come under intense criticism for his stance on lands
east of the Oder and Neisse rivers ceded to Poland after Nazi
Germany's 1945 defeat.
   Poland wants reassurance that once Germany is united it will not
seek to reclaim those lands. Poland in turn lost some of its
eastern territory to the Soviet Union after the war.
   Mazowiecki has also demanded that Poland be included in the
talks on German unification between the two German states and the
victorious World War II allies: the Soviet Union, the United
States, Britain and France. The process was announced last month in
Ottawa.
   Kohl has repeatedly said Germans have no designs on the
territory but has insisted that final say can only come from a
future united German government.
   Mazowiecki, after hearing of Kohl's latest position, said
``there is no reason to think we won't keep our word'' on
guaranteeing the ethnic rights of Poland's German minority.
   He also said Poland sees no reason to expand the scope of the
border issue.
   ``But if Bonn wants to expand the problem, please, we also have
something to say. For example, there's the question of compensation
for Polish forced laborers in the Third Reich,'' said Mazowiecki.
   West German-Polish relations have been sensitive for much of the
postwar period, mainly because of uneasy feelings that still linger
51 years after Nazi Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. East
Germany's Communist premier, Hans Modrow, has backed Mazowiecki's
demand for a place in the talks.
   For the first time Friday, Kohl openly said both Germanys could
conclude a treaty that would recognize Poland's western border for
a united Germany.
   But at the same time he demanded Poland's 1953 decision on war
reparations be an element of such agreement, as well as Poland's
assurance last year that the ethnic rights of its German minority
would be guaranteed.
   In the statement delivered by Vogel, Kohl also again avoided
stating outright that a united Germany would claim to land ceded to
Poland.
   According to Vogel, Kohl reiterated his support for both German
parliaments passing an identical declaration pledging to respect
the current borders after East Germany elects its first freely
chosen Parliament on March 18.
   Vogel said ``such a declaration must at the same time make clear
that the August 23, 1953 declaration of the Polish government, in
which reparations against Germany are renounced, continues
unchanged.''
   The Western powers ended reparations collections from West
Germany in 1952. The Soviet Union did the same for fellow Communist
state East Germany a year later, while Poland also said it would
not seek reparations.
   Vogel said that ``on the basis'' of a border resolution by the
German parliaments ``a treaty between an overall German government
with the Polish government should be concluded and be ratified by a
united German Parliament.''

   A KGB defector, who is looking for a publisher
for the book he's written, is going public with tales of alleged
Soviet involvement in a plot to kill the pope and spies inside the
State Department.
   Victor Ivanovich Sheymov, once KGB agent 04035, said Friday that
in the late 1970s the Soviet Union had two sources inside the State
Department able to deliver secret information on U.S. policy and
negotiating positions.
   But he said he had no idea who they might be.
   He also said he was present in the Warsaw station of the KGB in
1979 when a cable arrived from Moscow ordering what he believed to
be the initial stages of a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II.
   Nearly a decade after the CIA arranged his disappearance from
Moscow on May 15, 1980, Sheymov, 43, held a news conference to tell
at least some of his story in public and to announce: ``I have
written a book and am thinking how to publish it.''
   After a 78-minute session in which he dodged or declined to
answer questions on specific Soviet espionage activities, Sheymov
passed out business cards bearing the name Victor Orlov, which he
has used for the last decade.
   His most sensational allegation was that while on a trip to
Poland in 1979, the chief of the KGB's Warsaw station showed him a
cable from Yuri Andropov, then the KGB's chief, reading: ``Obtain
all the information possible on how to get physically close to the
pope.''
   ``In KGB slang it was clearly indicated that there was only one
reason to get close to a person and that was to assassinate him,
kill him,'' he said.
   Allegations of Soviet involvement in a plot to murder the pope
surfaced after an attempt on the pontiff's life in 1981 by a
Turkish gunman. No connection to Moscow was ever firmly established.
   Sheymov, a former KGB major and communications expert whose 1980
defection was kept secret for a decade, said he told his story to
the CIA but does not know what was done with the information.
   Sheymov told the news conference that the Soviet spy agency had
two sources inside the State Department.
   He was asked to provide specifics and declined, saying, ``I
cannot comment on these kinds of matters.''
   He said that the information received from the alleged spies
included ``policy matters, positions on negotiations, outlines of
arms control positions.''
   When asked for a reaction to Sheymov's allegations, David Denny,
a State Department spokesman said, ``As a matter of policy we do
not comment on intelligence matters, such as this.''
   The department is trying to fire Felix S. Bloch, a career
diplomat suspected of spying for the Soviet Union. No charges have
been brought against Bloch who was reportedly videotaped passing a
suitcase to a Soviet agent in Paris.
   Asked if he knew for certain that Bloch was a spy, Sheymov
replied: ``I cannot answer that question.''
   In his meeting with reporters, Sheymov wore tinted glasses and
what appeared to be a bushy blond wig.
   The defector answered many questions with non-responsive
one-liners.
   ``I live in a wonderful section of the country,'' he replied
when asked where he resided.
   When asked how much he had been paid by the CIA, he replied:
``Are you a salesman for mutual funds?''
   What had he told his neighbors when they asked about his
background?
   ``I told them I was not who I was,'' he said. ``I lied.''

<HEAD>Dole's Dog a Daddy, But Should Have Been Neutered, Animal Shelter
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole's dog missed a date with the
doctor, and that has some people howling in protest.
   Leader, the power pooch owned by the Senate minority leader and
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, became a media star earlier this
week when the schnauzer was displayed at a Capitol news conference
along with a litter of his puppies.
   But it seems that Leader wasn't supposed to become a daddy.
   The Doles adopted the dog from the Washington Humane Society in
November 1984. The adoption contract required that Leader be
neutered within seven days. But it hasn't happened yet _ more than
five years later.
   Proof came from the Doles when they unveiled the litter of eight
puppies sired by Leader. The other half of the canine couple was a
schnauzer owned by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   Jean Johnson, executive director of the Washington Humane
Society, was reluctant to discuss the case but confirmed Friday
that the organization is ``working with the Doles on how best to
resolve our concerns.''
   ``It's put us in a most awkward situation because we're very
strong proponents of sterilization and making every effort not to
contribute to the animal overpopulation problem,'' Johnson said.
   Walt Riker, press secretary for the Kansas Republican, couldn't
explain why the Doles failed to neuter their dog. But he said the
Doles have no plans for more puppies and emphasized that the
Thurmond-Dole litter would go to loving homes.
   ``He's not on the loose ... which made this a selective
breeding,'' Riker said of Leader. ``It wasn't like he was roaming
the streets of Washington creating litters all over town.''
   According to Johnson, the standard policy is for an adult dog
such as Leader to be neutered before the would-be owners take the
animal home. But exceptions are made on ``a rare occasion,'' she
said.
   After the seven-day deadline passed in 1984, the Humane Society
asked the Doles to follow through with the neutering. Johnson
declined to say whether there were more reminders.
   One animal welfare activist said the case was troubling because
of the widespread publicity about the puppies and their prominent
owners.
   ``This is a slight case of somebody who makes laws for all of
us, not obeying this one,'' said Kay Richter, who helps find homes
for unwanted dogs in the Washington area.

<HEAD>FDA Approves AZT for People Infected With AIDS-Causing Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says the drug
AZT may be recommended for adults infected with the virus that
causes AIDS even if the patients don't have symptoms of the disease.
   The drug has been used for three years to treat patients
severely ill with AIDS and related problems.
   ``The studies and the change in labeling mean that better
treatment can now be offered to thousands of people at earlier
stages of infection with the AIDS virus before their health
deteriorates critically,'' Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan said in a statement.
   FDA on Friday approved new labels expanding the drug's use after
two federally sponsored studies showed that AZT slowed progress of
the disease when administered to infected patients with early
symptoms or none at all.
   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and
Burroughs Wellcome Co., the drug manufacturer, conducted trials
involving 2,000 volunteers. AZT was shown to slow down the progress
of AIDS while causing far fewer severe side effects than those
suffered by patients in advanced stages of the disease.
   The FDA move should make it easier for patients to obtain
reimbursement under their health insurance policies, said Burroughs
Wellcome vice president J.R. Whitehead.
   Earlier this year the FDA approved a labeling change that cut in
half the recommended adult dose of AZT. The change reduced both the
frequency of side effects and the cost of treatment to patients.
   On Oct. 26, the FDA approved the use of AZT for children with
advanced cases of AIDS. The expanded application announced Friday
applies to adults only, but an agency spokesman said the question
of making AZT treatment available earlier to HIV-infected children
is expected to come up at an FDA advisory meeting later this month.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious disease that
attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of
resisting other diseases and infections.
   As of Dec. 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 117,781
Americans, of whom 60 percent, or 70,313, have died since June 1,
1981.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns $43.2 Million Ruling Against Toyota</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge set aside a $43.2 million judgment
against Toyota and ordered a new trial in a civil case brought by a
woman who watched her husband, two daughters and two other people
burn to death in a 1982 car fire.
   Arthur C. Lesher Jr., a retired state district judge, overturned
the Dec. 14 ruling after a three-hour hearing Friday.
   In an interview later, Lesher said, ``I found that in the
interest of justice and fairness, it should be tried again.'' He
would not elaborate.
   Lesher presided over the six-week trial against Torrance,
Calif.-based Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. last fall. A jury found
Toyota negligent in the design of its 1973 Corona station wagon.
   On Dec. 29, Lesher signed off the jury's award of $18.2 million
in actual damages and $25 million in exemplary damages to Nike
Adegbite, 36, whose husband and two daughters died in the burning
car along with two others.
   The $43.2 million judgment was the largest award ever entered
against the Japanese car company.
   Texas courts on occasion call retired judges back to the bench
because of a statewide case backlog.
   Houston attorney Stan Pfeiffer, who represents Mrs. Adegbite,
was angered by Friday's ruling.
   ``This trial judge has felt compelled for whatever reason to
completely ignore the findings of the jury,'' Pfeiffer said.
``There was no substantive complaint about the trial procedure
alleged by Toyota nor that this jury was being unreasonable.''
   But Douglas M. West, Toyota's vice president-general counsel for
product law, said the company believed the verdict and the size of
the damage award were unfair.
   ``We felt, taken as a whole, the evidence presented to the
jurors did not support the finding of a defect in the 1973 model
and it did not support the damages that were awarded, particularly
the $25 million in punitive damages,'' West said by telephone from
California.
   During the trial, Pfeiffer said the Sept. 26, 1982, accident
happened when the driver of the Toyota station wagon, Boyo Adetoye,
tried to steer off a roadway because he had a flat tire, and his
car was struck by a van.
   The impact pushed the station wagon's fuel tank forward and the
tank was punctured by an empty spare tire carrier and a valve on
the rear axle, Pfeiffer said in December.
   The car burst into flames. Adetoye and Mrs. Adegbite escaped
with burns and minor injuries, but Adetoye's wife and child were
killed the fire, as were Mrs. Adegbite's husband and two children.
   Adetoye has settled with Toyota for an undisclosed sum.
   West argued that the accident ``was extremely violent and far
beyond the kind of accidents that can be designed for.''
   But jury foreman Larry Phipps said he was ``very much
astounded'' that the verdict was overturned.
   ``It's almost as though several weeks of going down there (to
the courthouse) daily was just thrown down the drain for no
apparent reason,'' Phipps said. ``I do feel the jury did fulfill
their responsibility as prescribed by the court and rendered their
decision in good faith.''

<HEAD>Gun Law Crackdown Will be Mounted in 8 Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal task forces are moving into eight
cities later this month to try to catch people breaking federal gun
laws that bring mandatory prison sentences.
   The Project Achilles task forces will be in place by March 26 in
New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Detroit,
Washington and Phoenix, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
said Friday.
   The ATF conducted a similar, four-month Armed Career Criminal
operation in Washington last year as a prelude to the upcoming
project.
   Congress last year included $4.5 million in the ATF's budget for
1990 specifically as salaries for 75 fulltime workers in the
Achilles task forces in five cities, but the ATF expanded that
number to eight.
   The agents will work with state and local law enforcement
officials.
   The task forces will be targeting people under two sections of
federal law that call for mandatory sentencing.
   One says anyone convicted of a felony crime of violence or drug
charge who is carrying a gun automatically is sentenced for at
least five years on the weapon-possession charge.
   The other section says that a person who has three previous
felony convictions for a violent crime or drug offense will be
sentenced to at least 15 years on the firearm charge.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Move To Block Secord's Appeal Of His Guilty Plea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra prosecutors are trying to block a
court appeal by Richard Secord until a lower court judge decides
whether to reinstate 11 other criminal charges against him.
   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 8
to making a false statement when he told congressional
investigators he was unaware of any money that went to benefit
Oliver North.
   But Secord announced his intention to appeal after his
sentencing Jan. 24 and the government says he is trying to
circumvent his plea agreement with the government. Under that plea
agreement, the government agreed not to pursue 11 other criminal
charges against Secord.
   The appeal is based on a contention by Secord's lawyers that
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh lacks jurisdiction to prosecute
for an offense arising out of Secord's testimony to Congress.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors Feb. 5 asked U.S. District Court Judge
Aubrey Robinson to reconsider his decision dismissing the 11 other
charges.
   ``While the District Court has before it important questions
relating to the effectiveness of the plea agreement in this case,''
the appeals court proceedings should be stopped, prosecutors said
in a court filing Friday.
   The government argues it was ``an act of bad faith'' for Secord
to plead guilty with the undisclosed intent of challenging the
validity of the plea.

<HEAD>Auditors Cite Risk of Earthquake Damage at Nuclear Arms Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Savannah River nuclear weapons plant in
South Carolina is inadequately protected against severe earthquakes
and won't be fully protected for several years, say federal
auditors.
   The report Friday by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said the vulnerability to earthquake
damage at Savannah River has been known for many years. But it said
the government only recently made serious corrective efforts.
   The plant has nuclear reactors to produce tritium, a radioactive
gas needed to make nuclear warheads. The installation also contains
other nuclear-related buildings, including a fuel processing center
for the Navy and a radioactive waste treatment building.
   The three reactors have been closed for nearly two years because
of safety problems. One of the three is expected to resume
production by the end of this year.
   The auditors, in a report requested by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,
chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on the
environment and energy, said seismic improvements at Savannah River
would not be completed for several years.
   Planning of improvements is under way, but ``it will take
several years to accomplish adequate seismic protection at Savannah
River,'' the report said.

   Surrounded by hundreds of people
shouting ``Go away beggars!'' the family of deposed dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega left for Caribbean exile.
   The crowd shouted at Noriega's wife, three daughters, son-in-law
and grandson as left the Cuban ambassador's residence Friday, where
they sought refuge after the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that overthrew
the general.
   Throwing pennies at the Noriegas, some people said, ``This is to
pay your husband's bail,'' referring to comments Noriega's wife,
Felicidad Siero, made saying she would travel around Panama asking
for donations for her husband's defense.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug charges in Miami, where he was
extradited after taking refuge in the Vatican Embassy and later
surrendering to U.S. authorities.
   The family arrived at the airport Friday night surrounded by
Cuban diplomatic personnel, then left for Havana on Cubana de
Aviacion. An airline employee said the Noriegas took ``dozens of
trunks, cradles and suitcases.''
   On Wednesday, the Panamanian government said that it would allow
safe passage out of the country for Mrs. Noriega, daughters Lorena,
Sandra and Thais, a son-in-law, Jean Rene Beauchamps and a
7-month-old grandson.
   Beauchamps, a Dominican who was the only family member to stay
behind, is scheduled to leave next week after discussing
allegations of financial irregularities with authorities. He is to
pay a $10,000 bond before leaving.
   Beauchamps said the family would be going to the Dominican
Republic, which offered them asylum. It was not clear when they
would go from Cuba.
   After leaving the Cuban ambassador's residence Friday, the
Noriegas went in a caravan of cars to the beachfront apartment of
Sandra and her husband.
   Daughters Sandra and Lorena are accused of corruption, and
Sandra paid a $50,000 bond to leave the country. The government
granted safe conduct passes for the Noriegas on the condition that
they would face extradition if they failed to return to face any
charges.
   The U.S. and Panamanian governments allege that Noriega earned
billions of dollars through illicit activity. Several of his bank
accounts in various countries have been frozen.

   An unarmed cruise missile malfunctioned
during a test flight and crashed in southwest Utah about a
quarter-mile from a main highway, the Air Force and a local
official said Friday.
   The air-launched missile was being tested for the Strategic Air
Command when it went down Tuesday southwest of Delta, said Lt. Col.
Portia McCracken, spokeswoman at Ogden's Hill Air Force Base.
   A malfunction inside the missile triggered a system that sent it
to ground to avoid an uncontrolled flight, she said.
   ``It fell in an unpopulated area,'' she said. The crash site is
a desolate stretch of land about 100 miles southwest of Salt Lake
City.
   But Millard County Sheriff Ed Phillips said the missile crashed
about a quarter-mile from U.S. Highway 6-50, a main east-west route.
   ``We've had several of 'em go down over the years,'' Phillips
said. ``That's really concerned me that it came down so close to
the road.''
   Two F-4 chase jets reported the crash and local authorities were
notified, McCracken said. Phillips said a deputy was dispatched to
guard the wreckage until Pentagon officials arrived.
   The wreckage was removed Thursday, McCracken said.
   Cruise missile tests are run by the 6545th Test Group based at
Hill Air Force Base, McCracken said. The missile was aimed at the
Utah Test and Recovery Range, about 60 miles northwest of the crash
site.

   Two airliners bound from New York made safe

   TWA Flight 829 reported a warning light indicating problems with

   The pilot of Pan Am Flight 2027, with 150 people, reported
hydraulic problems and said he was worried about making the runway,
officials said.
   The pilot manually lowered the landing gear and the plane was
towed to the terminal after it landed safely at 8 p.m. CST,
Edelstein said.
   Edelstein said airport officials alerted emergency personnel and
had a score of fire trucks and ambulances on standby by the time
the TWA flight landed.
   Flight 829, with 173 people on board, left O'Hare for Kansas

   A letter in which the late Malcolm Forbes
offers jokingly to vote on behalf of the dead for Rudy Boschwitz
startled the senator's staffers when it arrived in Boschwitz's
office this week.
   The letter, written on stationery from Forbes' New York office,
was dated Feb. 14 but did not arrive in the Washington, D.C.,
office until Monday, two days after Forbes died in his sleep at age
70, said Boschwitz's press secretary, Tim Droogsma.
   Forbes apparently wrote the letter to say he would not be able
to appear at a fund-raiser for the Republican senator, Droogsma
said. But in a bit of oddly prescient humor, Forbes also referred
to the old vote fraud practice of casting the votes of dead people.
   ``I'm certainly supportive, and if you can locate a tombstone or
two for me to vote from, I'll be happy to,'' Forbes wrote.
   Droogsma said the letter elicited a lot of ``oohs'' in the
Boschwitz office.

<HEAD>Electoral Violence Hurts Acapulco Tourism, State Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TALLI NAUMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Election-related violence that blocked
airport roads and left three people dead is scaring tourists from
Acapulco and Ixtapa, costing the resorts millions of dollars in
lost revenue, a government spokesman said.
   ``It's hurting the tourist industry. We're worried that the
people who make a living from tourism are affected,'' Guerrero
state spokesman Francisco Javier Rangel said Friday in a telephone
interview.
   Tourism is Mexico's third-largest source of foreign exchange and
the largest industry in western Guerrero state, where 60 percent of
the population depends on tourism for a livelihood, Rangel said.
   On Tuesday, one policeman and two members of the opposition
Democratic Revolutionary Party died as a result of armed
confrontations between officers and protesters on airport roads in
the Pacific coast state.
   The center-left party alleges fraud in official results from 20
of the state's 75 municipalities in elections Dec. 3. Other
protests have occurred in neighboring Michoacan state.
   Supporters are blocking entrances to the 20 city halls in
Guerrero where they claim election results were doctored, and they
have taken control of tax collection in one of the towns.
   Acapulco and Ixtapa, 100 miles away, are not among the
municipalities contested, but the demonstrations are affecting
business there, Rangel said.
   An Acapulco hotel and restaurant association estimates losses at
more than $6 million, he said.
   Rangel said charter planes and hotel reservations were canceled
as a result of Tuesday's incidents, but that officials at the
state's two international airports report that flights are running
as usual.
   He said the state has doubled its highway patrols on all state
highways since Tuesday to protect travelers.
   The opposition party is appealing state election returns at the
Federal Electoral Commission, where Guerrero Gov. Francisco Ruiz
Massieu discussed the problem Friday with Interior Secretary
Gutierrez Barrios, Rangel said.
   Both officials belong to the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
   The state has charged 16 opposition party members with a variety
of offenses related to Tuesday's violence and has arrested about 30
others, Rangel said.
   ``We're not pressing the cases because they're party members,
but because they committed offenses,'' he said.
   The opposition party members are charged with attempted
homicide, attacks on traffic routes, resisting arrest, robbery,
illegal arms and drug possession, Rangel said.
   The state has called on all Democratic Revolutionary Party
leaders to avoid violence, Rangel said.
   Party leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas on Wednesday blamed the
governing party for ``unleasing'' the violence.
   ``If the authorities respected the law, there wouldn't have been
electoral fraud on Dec. 3 and the continuing incidence of
violence,'' Cardenas said.
   Cardenas ran for president in 1988, supported by a multiparty
coalition, whose members later formed the Democratic Revolutionary

<HEAD>Vietnam Produces Record Amount of Food; Exports For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Vietnam said it exported
grain last year for the first time, and it credited credited
agricultural reform and favorable weather for the increased
productivity.
   The official Vietnam News Agency, in a report seen today in
Bangkok, also said the country increased its reserves in producing
a record 21.4 million tons of food in 1989.
   Vietnam is one of the world's poorest nations, with chronic
difficulties in feeding its 64 million million. In the past, it had
to import about 750,000 tons annually.
   The report dated Friday said production rose because of good
weather, increased state investment, reforms in agricultural
management, high-yielding rice strains, and a single nationwide
price policy.
   After a decade of disastrous economic policies, Vietnam in 1986
introduced reforms such as deregulating prices, permitting private
enterprise and vastly curtailing subsidies to state enterprises.
   
   Substantial gains in food production and in fighting inflation
were made last year.
   The report said millions of tons of grain were exported but it
did not further specify or say to which countries the food was
shipped. It did not say what last year's production was or when the
previous production record was achieved.
   The announcements were made at a Feb. 27-28 conference to review
progress in agricultural production.

<TEXT>
   Stranded Greyhound bus passengers were running out of money and
patience waiting for buses to roll past lines of angry pickets
after drivers went on strike against the only nationwide bus
company.
   The strike's first day was mostly peaceful, but in Chicago two
people were slightly injured on Friday by flying glass when a
sniper fired two shots at a Greyhound bus leaving the city,
Illinois State Police said.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. said it was operating 20 percent of its
system with 700 newly hired replacement drivers, plus an
unspecified number of union drivers who crossed picket lines.
   Passengers on a bus arriving in Des Moines, Iowa, early Friday
also said strikers fired four shots at their bus as it left a
Chicago depot.
   There were scattered reports of angry confrontations between
strikers and replacement drivers in other cities. Union leaders
appealed for calm.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, which
represents more than 9,000 employees, including all 6,300 drivers
and most maintenance and office workers, went on strike Friday
after negotiators in Scottsdale, Ariz., failed to reach agreement
on wage issues.
   In all, the company said 1,100 union-represented employees came
to work. Greyhound said it would increase operations as more
replacements become available.
   No talks were scheduled, and negotiators were planning to return
home.
   Passengers, meanwhile, tried to figure out how to get home. Some
angrily denounced the company for not warning of the strike.
   ``I'm stuck here and I don't know what to do,'' said Alvira
Sheffield, who left from Maine on Thursday and spent the night in
the Port Authority bus terminal in New York City. ``They knew about
the strike. I don't know why they let me board the bus.''
   Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale said: ``Obviously we have
not lived up to our expectations of making sure that our passengers
were taken care of.
   ``I am sorry and it certainly was not intentional to leave
anyone where they didn't want to be.''
   Greyhound serves 9,500 destinations, including 9,000 where it is
the only intercity transportation available. The company offers the
cheapest form of such transportation, including an advance purchase
one-way fare of $68 anywhere in the country, and the strike
stranded many poor people trying to leave or return home to smaller
communities.
   In Omaha, Neb., about 60 people _ many passengers on
coast-to-coast trips _ filled the small downtown bus terminal,
where babies sat on blankets, in car seats and in the arms of
parents walking around luggage, bags and boxes.
   Amtrak told agents to honor Greyhound tickets when buses are
unavailable, railroad spokeswoman Sue Martin said.
   Clifton Lenoir, 37, a New Orleans truck driver stranded in
Dallas, said he was down to his last 85 cents but he wasn't angry
at the drivers.
   ``They just want better working conditions and benefits. I don't
blame them,'' Lenoir said.
   Other passengers were less sympathetic.
   ``It's getting to the point where we're ready to go out there
and fire one of the buses up, run over the strikers and say, `See
ya,''' said Frank Rzepski of Philadelphia, waiting in Indianapolis.
   ``I was supposed to be in Portland early (Friday) afternoon for
a job interview,'' said Margaret Huffstadler of Eugene, Ore., as
she waited in a bus depot. ``I guess I can kiss that one goodbye.''
   Pickets outside the terminal in Columbus, Ohio, met buses
crossing picket lines at the entrance and tried to stop drivers to
ask them not to cross their lines. But the drivers inched their
buses forward, nudging strikers.
   ``We certainly are intending for this to be a peaceful strike,''
union spokesman Jerry Nelson said. ``We do not condone violence
during the strike nor destruction of property. We urge both sides
to show restraint.''
   A 47-day Greyhound drivers' strike in 1983 included several
violent incidents.
   The drivers' union said in its final proposal Thursday that it
would agree to wage increases limited to $17 million, or 5 percent,
in the first year of a new contract, with $15 million in both of
the final two years.
   The company was offering $14.1 million, $21 million and $27.7
million over the three years, but with some increases contingent on
increased ridership, safety records and productivity factors. The
union refuses to accept the contingencies.
   Greyhound drivers, who according to the company earned an
average of $24,743 last year, took a 22 percent pay cut three years
ago in negotiations prior to a leveraged buyout of the company.

   The strike against Greyhound Lines Inc. disrupted the only
nationwide bus company, dumping a few passengers in mid-journey to
spend the night in terminals and to scramble for alternate
transportation. Here are some vignettes:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In Des Moines, Iowa, passengers arriving from Chicago said they
were shot at three times as their Greyhound bus left Chicago. There
were no injuries and a small area on the windshield was broken and
covered with tape.
   ``When the window cracked, everybody thought they were throwing
rocks and then they hit it again, and they shot again and we got
down a couple of more blocks,'' said passenger Terry Fisher.
   ``They chased the bus and threw cans and garbage cans at us. I
didn't think we were going to make it to tell the truth.''

   Passengers stranded in Atlanta, bored and busless, poured
quarters into coin-operated television sets turned up loud to drown
out a floor polisher and waited for a way out. A few grabbed cat
naps.
   ``They left us, they flat left us here,'' said Simon Belle of
Memphis, Tenn., who said he was trying to visit relatives in
Florida. ``Now they won't do diddley, they wash their hands just
like Pontius Pilate.''

   In Raleigh, N.C., Carmen Bartee said she's been all over the
state in her quest to get to Wilmington from Texas.
   ``Greensboro, Winston-Salem, where else did we go today?'' she
asked. ``We've done a little bit of everywhere. ... I don't know
how I got here.
   ``If you ask me, I think they should go back to work and let
people go home,'' she said.

   Rob Wilkins, 22, of London, said the strike had disrupted his
plans to tour America by bus. He was trying to get from Minneapolis
to Memphis, Tenn.
   ``I'm not going to see Elvis,'' he lamented. ``I come to bloody
America and they're on strike.''

   Sam Byler, an Amish farmer from Fort Plain 40 miles west of
Albany, N.Y., took a Seneca Coach Line bus to Syracuse, hoping to
board a Greyhound bus to reach a wedding in Pennsylvania.
   ``We didn't know about the strike, because we don't have radios
and TVs like you people,'' Byler said. ``If we had known, we
probably would have stayed home.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Some passengers complained that they were unaware that a strike
was looming and criticized Greyhound for selling them tickets when
it was likely they wouldn't be able to complete their trips.
   ``They haven't even apologized,'' said Lisa Olkon, who was stuck
in Atlanta while trying to get home to St. Paul, Minn., from
Florida. ``I called about an hour before I went to get on the bus''
and was told nothing.

   ``I had heard of a possible strike, but I had no idea they were
going to dump us,'' said Jennifer White, waiting in Indianapolis to
return to Cleveland from a business trip in St. Louis.
   ``Because I'm afraid to fly, I chose Greyhound to leave the
driving to them,'' she said, laughing.

   After spending the night on a hard floor in the Indianapolis bus
station, Frank Rzepski of Philadelphia had little sympathy for the
drivers.
   ``It's getting to the point where we're ready to go out there
and fire one of the buses up, run over the strikers and say, `See
ya,' '' he said.

   ``I sympathize with them (passengers), but sometimes it comes to
this,'' said Dwight Moody, an 11-year veteran driver from
Charlotte. ``We're not asking for an arm and a leg, just a little
something. A couple of cents a mile.''
   Moody said despite Greyhound's ads that say first-year drivers
can earn about $24,000 a year, he only earned about $16,000 in 1989.
   ``I got a W-2 (tax form) to prove it,'' he said.

   Robert Eldridge of New York City said his trip home from San
Diego came to a dead halt in Washington, D.C.
   ``It was 2:30 in the morning and Greyhound said we would have to
finish on Amtrak. It's about nine blocks from the bus office to the
train, but it's the middle of the night and the people at Greyhound
said that a cab's $3,'' Eldridge said.
   He said cab drivers were soliciting riders at the Greyhound
counters. When he and two fellow passengers arrived at the station,
they were charged $16.

   Jim Redel, Greyhound's Indianapolis area general manager coped
with angry passengers.
   ``We try to console them and tell them help is on the way,''
Redel said of his advice to stranded passengers. ``I'm sorry it
happened. Seems like nobody ever wins in a strike situation.''

<HEAD>U.N. Experts, Activists Say Much Work Remains to End Sex
Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY CHENAULT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic hard times gripping Third World
countries have created dire conditions for women and impeded
efforts to wipe out sex discrimination and exploitation, U.N.
experts and activists say.
   ``There has been some progress worldwide in life expectancy for
women, declines in infant mortality and improvements in
nutrition,'' said Vivian Lowery Derryck, president of the
African-American Institute in New York.
   ``But when you get to the equality issues, the picture is
starkly gloomy,'' she said.
   Deteriorating economic conditions have forced women to turn to
begging, prostitution and other ``quasi-legal and illicit
activities'' in India, Peru and several African nations, according
to a UNICEF study.
   The observance of International Women's Day on Thursday and
related activities worldwide will focus more attention on work to
promote equal rights for men and women.
   The U.N. Commission on the Status of Women, meeting this week in
Geneva, has concentrated on political and economic obstacles facing
women, with a special interest in areas affected by armed conflicts
or foreign intervention.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in a special
address to mark International Women's Day, plans to call for a
renewed global commitment to improve conditions for women.
   ``Both men and women must work together as equal partners in
order to ensure a sustainable future for the generation to come,''
the U.N. chief says in a prepared statement.
   Recent U.N. reports stress there is much more work to do.
   ``Poor women have become poorer, more women are poor, and women
are now poorer in relation to men,'' one U.N. report says.
``Through their hard work they try to ensure the survival of the
poorest segments of the population, but at great cost to themselves.
   ``This drain on women's time, resources and energy also inhibits
their ability to participate in political life and hence in having
an influence in changing the policies which affect them so
adversely,'' the report adds.
   Economic problems also have diminished opportunities for young
women, particularly in Latin America and Africa.
   ``The crisis has diminished educational and economic
opportunities for young women, thus affecting their future ability
to contribute to society on an equal basis with men,'' the U.N.
report said.
   A UNICEF-sponsored study on Mexico found that the economic
crisis had worsened conditions for women, particularly in rural
areas. Because families could no longer survive intact in the
countryside, young women were forced to migrate to find work.
   The report by UNICEF said women were pulled off the land to work
as day laborers where they had no social benefits, lived in sheds
and were easy targets for sexual abuse. And for those women left on
the farms there was more work to do, the report said.
   Another UNICEF study concluded that at least one-third of the
population with the lowest incomes in Latin America and the
Caribbean has been kept afloat by poor women working harder and
longer hours.
   UNICEF research has found that Brazilian mothers, because of
their increased responsibilities in coping with the financial
crisis of the 1980s, are experiencing greater mental health
problems. Those women feel ``doubly guilty'' for the plight of
their families, the UNICEF study says.
   Activists point out there are significant signs of progress.
   ``In Eastern Europe, South Africa and Central America you can
see that it's the all boats rising with the tide phenomenon,'' Ms.
Lowery Derryck said. ``Women can see change, and it empowers them.
Now we need to capitalize on these changes.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Deukmejian Administration In Toxic Warnings
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled that hundreds of
chemicals found in cosmetics, foods and drugs must meet the
standards of a law enacted by California voters that requires
warning labels on toxic products.
   Judge Ronald Robie said Friday that Gov. George Deukmejian's
scientific advisory panel, which drew up the list of compounds that
must bear the labels under Proposition 65, had incorrectly exempted
numerous products from the 1986 initiative.
   Robie's decision finalized a tentative ruling he issued last
fall in a lawsuit brought by environmentalists and labor groups who
argued that Deukmejian was seeking to sidestep the regulations
approved by voters.
   Robie said the state had created an improper exemption ``for
selected industries without specific regard to the chemicals
involved.''
   If upheld on appeal, his ruling could force food, drug and
cosmetic companies to evaluate thousands of products to determine
if they pose a significant chemical risk. If that determination is
made, Proposition 65 requires that those items carry a warning
label.
   Companies will have to spend millions analyzing their products
to show that they pose no significant risk, said Peter Hutt, a
Washington lawyer representing the Grocery Manufacturers of America.
   Steven Berzon, an attorney representing the coalition that
challenged the Deukmejian administration, said Robie's ruling
``goes 100 percent in our favor.''
   Proposition 65, the so-called clean water initiative, requires
warning labels on substances that pose a ``significant risk'' for
cancer and birth defects.
   The standards established by Proposition 65 are stricter than
those set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and in
interpreting the initiative state officials initially said FDA
standards could be used for at least 20,000 consumer products.
   Grocery industry representatives had argued that ``significant
risk'' was a vague term, and said that removing the exemption would
prompt unnecessary warnings and undermine consumer confidence.
Robie flatly rejected that argument.
   ``Defendant's interpretation that the initiative accepted
business as usual in regulatory terms as to these important
industries is not correct,'' he wrote.
   Gene Linvingston, a lawyer in Sacramento for the Cosmetic,
Toiletry and Fragrance Association, said many companies will put
warning labels on their products even if they pose no risk in order
to avoid being taken to court.

<HEAD>Writers Settle With CBS; Wages Go Up, But So Do Health Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS television and radio writers in four cities
have reached a tentative agreement with the network under which
their wages would rise 5 percent immediately and another 5 percent
in September 1991.
   Under the agreement reached Friday between CBS and the Writers
Guild of America East, they would also pay up to 20 percent of
their health costs. The rank and file is scheduled to vote on the
pact Monday.
   The new package also provides improvements in employee safety
and increases in special fees for newswriters, desk assistants and
others, the union said.
   The average newswriter's weekly pay goes from $863 in the
current contract to $949 by the new contract's end, said Guild
spokesman Martin G. Waldman.
   The new agreement covers 325 employees at CBS network television
and radio in New York and Washington; at WCBS-TV and radio in New
York; WBBM-TV and WBBM radio in Chicago; and KCBS-TV and KNX radio
in Los Angeles.
   ``The agreement that has been reached is equitable and makes
progress in key areas,'' Mona Mangan, the eastern Guild's executive
director. ``If our members approve the settlement, we will have
avoided the unfortunate situation of three years ago when
management attempts to gut our contract forced us to strike.''
   CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said no one at the network was
available to comment on the contract.
   The agreement that writers will pay a maximum of 20 percent of
the health benefit premiums kicks in the same day as the second
raise.
   ``This is not that uncommon these days,'' said Waldman.
   Writers Guild East news staffers at Capital Cities-ABC network
television and radio and local stations in New York and Washington
approved the same wage package Feb. 5; they already had been paying
a share of their health costs, Waldman said.
   The members of the Writers Guild, East and West, are
newswriters, editors, desk assistants, researchers, promotion
writers and graphic artists.

<TEXT>
   Among the perils threatening the 70
racers and dog teams who mush today in the 18th annual Iditarod
Trail Sled Dog Race are hunger-crazed moose and ash from the
Redoubt Volcano.
   Not to mention the weather.
   Temperatures hit the 40s and turned snow into slush on the
streets of downtown Anchorage, where the race begins. But
conditions are some of the harshest in the history of the race
along the 1,100-mile trail to Nome on the Bering Sea.
   ``Awful weather,'' said Race Manager Jack Niggemyer. ``It's
probably snowed 40 inches in the last two days.''
   The heavy snow has kept moose from grazing, setting the stage
for violent encounters between the huge animals and sled dog teams
on the remote trail, and prudent mushers are packing rifles.
   Redoubt has been erupting intermittently since December, spewing
ash as far north as the area around Anchorage.
   The race usually lasts from 11 to 18 days. The record time, set
by Susan Butcher of Manley in 1987, was 11 days, two hours and five
minutes. Butcher also won in 1986 and 1988.
   Since Libby Riddles became the first woman to win in 1985, women
have won the race four of the last five years, inspiring a popular
T-shirt saying, ``Alaska: Where men are men and women win the
Iditarod.''
   Some participants and race observers said they expect the pace
to be slowed this year because of the deep snow and poorly-packed
trail.
   ``We might run out of trail,'' said Lavon Barve, a musher from
Wasilla who finished fifth last year. ``It's up to the mushers to
snowshoe or whatever.''
   The Iditarod was begun in 1973 to commemorate the emergency
delivery of diphtheria serum to Nome by mail carriers driving dog
teams in 1925.
   Taken overland after bad weather grounded airplanes, the serum
was credited with saving hundreds of lives in the remote town.
   From downtown Anchorage, the course goes northwest across the
Alaska Range and over the tundra before dropping down along the
Yukon River to the Bering Sea.
   Mushers must lay over for 24 hours of rest at some point along
the trail.
   The mystique of the Iditarod has grown steadily, with mushers
this year arriving from France and Switzerland. Companies spend
tens of thousands of dollars to sponsor top competitors.
   Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, the only person to win the Iditarod
four times, will be trying for a fifth win.
   Last year's winner, Joe Runyan of Nenana, expects the teams to
start out slow because of bad weather.
   ``The big strategy this year in terms of snow is to reduce
injury,'' Runyan said.
   But the teams can't afford to be too slow, he said.
   ``Even if you're conservative, it's better to be in the front of
the pack.''

   The Big Apple has launched a formal campaign to
snare the Grammy Awards from Los Angeles.
   ``Our campaign to get the Grammys is a major economic
development effort that can add some $30 million in commercial
revenues to our local economy next year,'' New York City Mayor
David Dinkins said at City Hall Friday.
   The revenue the 1991 ceremony would bring would be ``music to my
ears,'' he said.
   Dinkins named Edwin Cooperman, North American president of
American Express, to chair the NYC Host Committee-1991 Grammy
Awards.
   ``New York City has a rhythm all its own,'' Cooperman said,
``the swing of 52nd Street, Broadway's melodies, the pulse of steel
drums in parks around town. Ladies and gentlemen, the Grammys
belong where the beat is _ and that's in New York City!''
   The Grammys were held in New York in 1988 after seven years in
Los Angeles. They were back in Los Angeles the last two years.
   The Grammys honor talent in recorded music. The ceremony is
broadcast live nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed a judge, three police
officers and two city councilmen despite a truce declared by
leftist guerrillas during of a local election campaign, authorities
said.
   The country's leading newspaper reported Friday that the
Medellin cocaine cartel was preparing to renew its terrorist
campaign against the government and had hired two British
mercenaries.
   Police on Friday blamed members of the People's Liberation Army
for killing the judge and his three police bodyguards. Police gave
no motive for the shootings late Thursday near the village of
Puerto Hungria, about 300 miles south of Bogota.
   The slain criminal court judge, Carmen Elisa Rosas, was the 74th
magistrate killed in the last nine years. Authorities blame drug
traffickers or allied guerrilla forces for most of the
assassinations.
   The killings Thursday occurred just hours after the Maoist group
declared a unilateral halt to attacks to let voters go to the polls
March 11 in the municipal and legislative elections. The leftist
group said the truce will be in effect until April 1.
   In other attacks Thursday, gunmen assassinated Jaime Barrientos,
a city councilman for the governing Liberal Party in the town of
Amalfi in Antioquia state; and Eutimio Campos, a Conservative Party
councilman in Muzo in Boyaca state.
   The national police said they did not know who killed the
councilmen.
   In its report Friday, Bogota's El Tiempo indicated Pablo Escobar
and other leaders of the Medellin drug cartel were planning to
abandon a cease-fire they declared Jan. 17 in their anti-government
terrorist campaign.
   ``The leaders of the Medellin cartel are preparing for war,''
said the daily, which has a reputation for gaining access to the
highest counsels of Colombian government. It cited a report by the
intelligence police.
   The newspaper said the Medellin cartel had once again contracted
two British mercenaries, Brian David Tomkins and Peter MacAleese,
who allegedly trained death squads in 1988.
   Tomkins and MacAleese have already returned to Colombia after
fleeing the country two years ago, according to the report quoted
by El Tiempo.
   A spokeswoman for the intellegence police, Diva Rojas, confirmed
the report but said she could not discuss its contents.
   ``I don't know who leaked it. It is supposed to be
confidential,'' Rojas said in a telephone interview.
   In January, the cartel declared a halt to attacks and said it
had been defeated in a government crackdown. The announcement came
a month after the group's No. 2 leader, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
was killed in a Dec. 15 gunfight with police.
   The government began its push to destroy the cartels in August
after a leading presidential candidate, Luis Carlos Galan, was
assassinated by drug traffickers.
   Leaders of the leftist Patriotic Union Party announced Friday
that, lacking guarantees for their safe participation in March
elections, the party will ask former President Jimmy Carter to lead
an international commission to observe the balloting.
   Carter served as a foreign observer for Sunday's elections in
Nicaragua and oversaw elections in May in neighboring Panama.

   Students evacuated from a school because
of a bomb threat sat down on bleachers that had been vandalized by
aluminum thieves, and the bleachers collapsed, slightly injuring 19
students, officials said.
   Some bolts and braces had been removed from the aluminum
football field bleachers at Cedarcrest Junior High, about 10 miles
south of Tacoma, investigators said.
   About 650 students were evacuated from the school Friday morning
when someone called in a bomb threat, said Spanaway Fire Department
spokeswoman Shirley Corbett.
   One class, with about 40 students, was relocated to the
bleachers, which collapsed. No bomb was found.
   The injured students were released from area hospitals after
treatment for cuts, bruises and sprains, officials said.
   Detectives doubted there was a link between the vandalism and
the bomb threat, said Pierce County sheriff's spokesman Curt Benson.
   But bleachers at three other area schools also had been
vandalized, apparently by thieves lured by the high market for
scrap aluminum.
   ``All have similar braces, and we have found the braces from
those bleachers at the other schools missing as well,'' Benson said.
   A spokeswoman for the Reynolds Aluminum Recycling Co. said scrap
aluminum prices vary from 20 to 30 cents a pound.
   It wasn't known how much aluminum had been removed from the
school bleachers.

<TEXT>
   The big guns fell silent in embattled
east Beirut today under a cease-fire, but rival Christian forces
exchanged sniper fire as civilians fled to safety in other parts of
the country.
   Police said rescuers evacuated 12 dead and 26 wounded from the
Nabaa and Sin el-Fil districts overnight after the savage fighting
subsided into intermittent exchanges of sniper fire.
   By police count, the showdown for dominance of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave has left 766 dead and 2,087
wounded since the clashes broke out Jan. 30 between Gen. Michel
Aoun's forces and Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   On Friday morning, Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir
called the cease-fire and threatened to excommunicate Geagea, Aoun
and their followers if they maintained the fight.
   Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the Christian community which has
dominated politics in Lebanon since independence from France in
1943.
   Civilians used the relative lull today to flee the embattled
Christian enclave for safety in north Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa
Valley and the southern provinces.
   The police spokesman said long lines of cars, loaded with
mattresses, clothes and furniture, were seen heading out of the
enclave early today.
   The spokesman said about 200,000 people of the Christian
enclave's 1 million population, have fled since Jan. 30.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said the cease-fire came after a 36-hour battle that left more than
70 dead and resulted in a ``standstill.'
   Aoun wants Geagea's 6,000-strong militia subsumed into his force
of 19,000 mostly Christian army troops.
   Geagea has repeatedly declared his rejection of the general's
demand, and vowed to confront it to the end.
   The prestigious newspaper An-Nahar said the cease-fire, the
latest in a series of unsuccessful attempts to stop the fighting,
``reflected the balance of horror between both sides.''
   Aoun had tried to penetrate the Lebanese Forces defenses and
advance between Nabaa and Sin el-Fil to the seaside boulevard to
prepare for an advance by his tanks to the militia's headquarters
and adjacent Beirut port, a key militia supply line.
   Aoun has rejected parliament's election last fall of President
Elias Hrawi, who has pledged to enact a peace pact. Aoun says he
opposes the peace plan because it does not require the pullout of
40,000 Syrian troops, deployed under a 1976 Arab League mandate to
keep the peace in the civil war.
   Hrawi fired Aoun as army commander, but Aoun refused to step
down.

<HEAD>Computer Analysis Finds `Brushy Bill' Not Billy the Kid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that defends the legend of Billy
the Kid says a computer photo analysis indicates a Texan nicknamed
``Brushy Bill'' who died in 1950 probably wasn't the famed outlaw,
as he had claimed.
   The computer tests compared a photograph of Ollie L. ``Brushy
Bill'' Roberts, who died in Hico, Texas, a week short of his 90th
birthday in December 1950, and a tintype of William Bonney, who
died at age 21 on July 14, 1881.
   Most people, including a coroner's inquest jury at the time, say
Bonney was Billy the Kid and he was shot to death in Fort Sumter,
N.M., by Lincoln Sheriff Pat Garrett.
   But Hico has its share of Brushy Bill believers who maintain the
Kid escaped, perhaps with official help, to survive to a ripe old
age in Texas.
   Billy the Kid was one of the primary players in the bloody
Lincoln County War of the late 19th century. Now, the Lincoln
County Heritage Trust is watching out for the Kid's legend, and it
initiated the photo project.
   Trust director Robert L. Hart said Friday the computer tests
were based on a similarity index of 25 landmarks on the faces.
   The computer also matched Billy to a database of 150 people from
both sexes and many racial groups, Hart said, to show how many
people in the sample, if any, were closer in appearance to Billy
than was Brushy Bill.
   From the 25 landmarks of the face the computer mathematically
derives a single number _ the index of similarity.
   If Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid were the same man, Hart said,
``then in the comparison, Billy is No. 1 and Brushy should come out
No. 2.''
   ``When the comparison was run, Brushy Bill was No. 42.
   ``That means there were 40 other individuals who look more like
Billy the Kid than Brushy does. In short, Brushy doesn't look very
much like Billy the Kid at all,'' Hart said.
   Hico Justice of the Peace Bobby Hefner, a Brushy Bill buff, said
Friday the computer study means nothing.
   ``I don't accept the tintype as being Billy the Kid at all,''
Hefner said in a telephone interview from his Hico home. ``On the
other hand, I don't accept the study. You let me program my
computer, and I guarantee Brushy Bill'd be number one.''
   But Clyde Snow, an Oklahoma forensic anthropologist known for
his work on the remains of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele, said
the computer looks at photographs in a less subjective way than
people do.
   ``As far as Brushy Bill Roberts is concerned, the weight of the
evidence is to the point that if there were a court case, we'd be
willing to go in and say beyond a reasonable doubt the two
photographs are not photographs of the same individual,'' Snow said.
   Hart said the Brushy Bill comparison is the only one that has
been done. But the project plans to look at a dozen or so other
photographs, including pictures of two other claimants, John Miller
of Ramah, N.M., and Walking Henry Smith, and photographs believed
to be those of Billy taken at other times.
   That could take a couple of years.
   Hart called the project a ``marriage of history and technology.''
   ``Historians don't seem to be able to solve the problem of
whether Brushy Bill and Billy the Kid are the same person,'' and
bringing in science was another way to answer the question, he said.
   The photographs, one from a Las Vegas, N.M., collection and the
other owned by a San Francisco family, came to light after the
project began last year.
   Hefner, 54, agreed research would continue into the legend of
Billy the Kid.
   ``The old Texas Rangers had a saying that no one can stand up to
a man that's in the right and keeps on a-comin'. And that's my
approach to this,'' Hefner said. ``I'm in the right. I've enough
evidence in hand to convince anyone that doesn't have a prejudice.
   ``I never met old Brushy,'' he said. ``Maybe it's my sense of
fair play, of being justice of the peace: I want justice done for a
local man. I'd like to see it on through to a just conclusion.''

   Miss Michigan, a 20-year-old from Detroit
whose goal is to own a hotel, is 1990's Miss USA and will go on to
compete for the Miss Universe title.
   Carole Gist is the first black Miss USA, pageant spokeswoman
Donna Dilsaver said.
   She broke into tears as she was crowned Friday night by the
reigning Miss USA, Gretchen Polhemus, in front of host Dick Clark,
a black-tie crowd of about 3,500 and a live worldwide audience.
   The first runner-up was Miss South Carolina, Gina Tolleson, 20,
of Spartanburg, S.C. The second runner-up was Miss New Jersey,
Karin Hartz, 24, of Voorhees, N.J.
   Before the final three were picked, the field was narrowed to
six contestants including Brenda Leithleiter, 22, of Smyrna, Ga.;
Tiffany Tenfelde, 22, of Lakeside Park, Ky.; and Karin Meyer, 20,
of Anchorage, Alaska.
   Miss Gist, 6 feet tall with dark brown eyes and hair, is a
student in hotel and motel management and works for Holiday Inn.
She said that after finishing her degree, she wants to enter a
management training program, and would use the slogan ``Class for
Less Cash'' when she opens her hotel.
   Miss Gist said her long-term ambition was to establish a
performing arts foundation for disadvantaged children.
   During the semifinal round, Miss Gist was asked her opinion of
letting women in the military participate in combat.
   ``If a woman is capable of defending her country as well as the
next man she should be allowed to uphold her flag and do what she
can for her country as well. She should have the opportunity,'' she
said.
   Miss Gist said her most prized possession was her stuffed animal
collection and her favorite food was Italian.
   She describes herself as aggressive, determined and energetic.
   Her final interview question from the judges asked why she
should be chosen as Miss USA.
   ``I do believe I have something positive to share with the young
people of America, especially young women,'' she said. Only in
America can you achieve your goals if you ``believe in yourself and
put God in front of you,'' Miss Gist said.
   Judges for the pageant included former Olympian and professional
ice skater Robin Cousins, retired astronaut Gordon Cooper, Olympic
track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, music producer Kerry Gordy,
romance novelist Rebecca Brandewyne and Eileen Fulton, longtime
cast member on the soap opera ``As the World Turns.''
   The judges scored the contestants on the swimsuit category, on
evening gown competition and on responses to interview questions.
   The new Miss USA gets $88,000 in cash plus prizes that bring her
winnings to about $220,000. The other prizes include a car, a boat,
furs, jewelry, camera equipment, gowns, and a Los Angeles apartment.
   Five Miss USAs have gone on to be crowned Miss Universe. The
Miss Universe contest will be held in April.

<TEXT>
   Complaints from the widow of famed football
coach Vince Lombardi helped prompt the arrests of hundreds of
homosexual men at a turnpike service area named after him, a state
police spokesman says.
   Marie Lombardi complained to a detective more than 10 years ago
about the reputation of the New Jersey Turnpike's Vince Lombardi
Service Area as a hangout for gay men, Capt. Thomas Gallagher said
Friday.
   Mrs. Lombardi, who died in 1982, told the detective she was
disturbed by the service area's reputation and threatened to have
Lombardi's name and football memorabilia removed, the state police
spokesman said.
   The detective, whom Gallagher would not identify, said that
there had been many such complaints about the rest station in
northern New Jersey and that ``Mrs. Lombardi complained that it was
getting all this media attention.''
   In response to the protests, then-superintendent Clinton Pagano
launched an undercover operation that led to hundreds of arrests
between 1986 and last month.
   Officers working on overtime lingered in the men's room in teams
of two, encouraged men to join them in homosexual activity and then
arrested takers on charges of lewd conduct.
   The operation was halted last week by Col. Justin Dintino, whom
Gov. Jim Florio named to replace Pagano. Dintino called the
undercover operation ``repulsive.''
   ``No matter who started it, what let it continue was police
believing they could get away with this kind of behavior,'' said
Evan Wolfson, staff attorney for Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a New
York-based civil rights group that pressured New Jersey officials
to halt the crackdown.
   That group and other critics have labeled the operation
entrapment inspired by bigotry against a sexual minority.
   ``State police should not be preying on vulnerable minorities,
let alone wasting valuable resources on such an absurd operation,''
Wolfson said.
   Pagano, the superintendent for 14 years, was moved to the
less-prestigious job of director of the state Division of Motor
Vehicles.
   The exact number of arrests ensuing from the service area
crackdown is unknown, Gallagher said.
   The legal defense group has counted 540 arrests between February
1988 and October 1989, which covers only a portion of the period in
which the operation was underway.
   Jean Adubato, a turnpike spokeswoman, said she was not aware of
any complaints by the wife of the former Green Bay Packer coach,
who coached high school football in Englewood before joining the
professional ranks.
   ``We do not comment on what the state police do. It's strictly
in their hands,'' the spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Prepare Final Salvo in Hazelwood Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors prepared the final salvo in
their case against Joseph Hazelwood as the defense team geared up
to begin calling witnesses in the criminal trial of the Exxon
Valdez skipper.
   Hazelwood came down with the flu Friday, causing cancellation of
the day's court session and giving attorneys time for paperwork and
witness interviews.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole, who has presented four
weeks of testimony, said he had three more experts waiting to
testify Monday before he rests his case.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone told Hazelwood's lawyers to
be prepared to start calling witnesses on Tuesday. The judge also
suggested that lawyers begin work on proposed jury instructions.
Both sides will submit legal instructions and the judge will choose
which ones to give jurors when they begin deliberations.
   Johnstone told jurors the trial could be over in two to three
weeks.
   Meanwhile, the prosecution filed papers asking the judge to
admit evidence on whether Hazelwood's ship was in danger of sinking
after it ran aground on Bligh Reef, setting off the nation's worst
oil spill.
   They urged rejection of the tanker skipper's claim that evidence
about his ship's potential sinking is irrelevant.
   Hazelwood's lawyers contend it was impossible for the skipper to
move his giant tanker off the reef once it was stuck there, and
thus it makes no difference whether he tried to move it. They seek
to bar evidence on what might have happened if the ship moved.
   The state seeks to bolster the speculation of expert witnesses
on the subject by showing jurors the results of accident
simulations suggesting the tanker was in danger of capsizing or
sinking.
   The 43-year-old Hazelwood, from Huntington, N.Y., is charged
with criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. He could receive
7\ years in prison and fines of $61,000.
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling
11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. The
spill killed countless birds, fish and other marine animals and
blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shoreline.
   A key element in the charges against Hazelwood is recklessness,
and Assistant District Attoney Brent Cole is seeking to prove that
the skipper's alleged efforts to try moving the ship constituted
recklessness.
   According to a legal definition he has read to jurors, ``A
person acts recklessly ... when the person is aware of and
consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk ...''
It continues: ``The risk must be of such a nature and degree that
disregard of it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of
conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.''
   To be found guilty of second degree criminal mischief, the
felony, the jury must determine that Hazelwood recklessly risked
the property of another in an amount exceeding $100,000. Thus, the
prosecution must prove recklessness and risk.
   ``Captain Hazelwood is arguing that because it was impossible
for the Exxon Valdez to come free, there was no risk involved,''
said the prosecution's legal memorandum. But it added, ``The issue
is not whether it was possible for the vessel to come free, but
whether Captain Hazelwood's mistakes in not realizing the vessel
was firmly aground and not recognizing the danger in refloating
were reasonable.''

<HEAD>Gov't Allows South Korean to Visit North Korean Sister in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will allow a South
Korean man to travel to Japan for a reunion with his North Korean
sister, a former champion figure skater who he hasn't seen in
nearly 40 years, officials said today.
   The Seoul government only last year liberalized travel allowing
South Koreans to more easily obtain passports and travel abroad. It
restricts contact with North Koreans overseas and forbids travel to
North Korea unless authorized by the government, an approval seldom
given.
   Han Pil-sung, 58, will be given permission to meet his sister,
Han Pil-wha, 48, in Sapporo, Japan, during the March 9-14 Asiad
Winter Games, government officials said, requesting anonymity.
   Han's sister, serving as an official for North Korea's
delegation to the Asiad, arrived in Tokyo Friday night. Han's
travel plans were not known.
   The two were among an estimated 10 million family members
separated during the 1950-53 Korean War. The Korean peninsula is
split into Communist North Korea and the capitalist South Korea and
there's virtually no communication between citizens of the two
countries.
   Han told newspapers he spoke by telephone with his sister in
1971 when she took part in international skating competitions in
Austria and had hoped to see her during the 1972 Winter Olympics in
Sapporo.
   The reunion was not held, he said, because of ideological
differences between their two countries which remain technically at
war. The border between the two nations remains one of the most
heavily fortified in the world, and hundreds of thousands of troops
man both sides.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to ADD details of anti-inflation plan,

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina's biggest teachers
union said it will strike Monday on the first day of classes to
demand higher wages in this inflation-wracked nation.
   Also Friday, interest rates for interbank lending rose to record
levels _ 28 percent a day _ ahead of the government's scheduled
announcement of a new plan to try to rescue the economy. Analysts
said the increase reflected concern about the new government
measures to be announced Sunday.
   Few details have emerged about the plan, but President Carlos
Menem said this week that it will include increaseing telephone
rates by 300 percent. An official at the Economy Ministry, Raul
Cuello, said it would be a ``hyperstabilizing shock.''
   The announcement by the 650,000-member Confederation of
Education Workers followed wage strikes that shut down the federal
court system for two days this week and virtually all operations of
the national airline Aerolineas Argentinas on Thursday.
   College professors pressing similar wage demands have refused to
work for more than a week, delaying the taking and grading of
entrance examinations.
   Bus and train drivers, doctors at municipal hospitals, state
bank clerks, municipal employees and other have staged strikes in
past weeks to demand higher wages or protest government plans to
sell public companies and cut the fiscal budget.
   The teachers' union says it will keep up its strike if
government does not grant a basic wage of $66 a month _ twice the
present basic salary.
   Grammar schools are scheduled to resume Monday following a break
for the Southern Hemisphere's summer season. High schools and
colleges begin classes a week later.
   In 1988, a strike delayed the start of classes for more than two
months.
   Menem has been beset by inflation, currency and labor woes since
taking office in July.
   The cost of living soared by 79 percent in January, and it was
projected at about that level for February.
   Reflecting higher interest rates, banks borrowing australs, the
national currency, from other banks on Friday were paying 28
percent a day, according to the private news agency Diarios y
Noticias. That broke the record of 17 percent, set Wednesday. The
news agency called the new rate ``a world record.''
   Interest rates have gone up steadily the past two months as the
austral has fallen against the dollar, and banks have raised rates
to keep deposits.
   At the close of the business day Friday, the austral traded at
5,450 per dollar. It was 655-1 when Menem took office eight months
ago. When it was introduced in 1985, each austral was worth $1.20.
   The devaluations are linked with excessive money expansion by
the Central Bank and doubts about the government's economic program.
   Menem has raised public service rates drastically during his
eight months in office. He said four decades of economic decline
can only be reversed by opening up the state-dominated economy by
selling public companies, deregulating monopolies, lowering tariff
barriers, raising taxes and cutting subsidies.
   Newspapers in Buenos Aires speculated the government on Sunday
might announce controls on foreign exchange and restrictions on
wages and prices.
   Export taxes might also be raised, public workers fired and
utility rates increased a fourth time since Menem took office, the
newspaper La Nacion said.

   Rain spread today from the South to the Eastern seaboard and
more snow was forecast for the weekend in the Sierra Nevada.
   Rain fell late Friday from southwest Idaho and northwest Nevada
into southern Oregon as well as central and northern California.
   The rain was continuing today and moving into western Montana
and Wyoming, and northward into Washington state.
   After three dry years, Friday's showers brought the accumulated
rainfall in Northern California closer to normal for the area.
Forecasters expected the rain to continue over the weekend.
   Rain was expected today in a band extending from North Carolina
up through New England, with precipitation changing to snow in
Maine.
   There were no reports late Friday of measurable snowfall in the
Sierras, and it was to diminish early today. But another storm was
expected to move across the mountains Sunday.
   Thunderstorms and rainshowers spread across the South, from
northern Georgia and Alabama to northeast Mississippi, Tennessee,
and eastern Kentucky. Rain also fell in southern West Virginia,
Virginia, Delaware and Maryland.
   Heavy rainfall reported late Friday included three-fourths of 1
inch near Montgomery, Ala. and Chattanooga, Tenn. Two-thirds of 1
inch fell at Redding, Calif., and Pensacola, Fla.
   The high temperature for the nation today was 87 degrees at
Yuma, Ariz.

   Two British visitors thought they were getting
room service when they heard a knock on their hotel door, but
instead they were tied up and ripped off _ and lost more than $2
million in gems, police said.
   Two men knocked on the door of The Halloran House hotel room in
midtown Manhattan at about 2 p.m. Friday, said a police spokesman.
   When the door was opened, the robbers forced their way in, and
ordered Darius Guppy, 25, and Benedict Marsh, 27, to open the safe
in their room, and removed over $2 million in assorted gems,
including rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, said Officer Fred Weiner.
   Then they tied up Guppy and Marsh, fired a shot and left, Weiner
said. No one was injured.
   Guppy and Marsh, who work for Inca Gem Stores, a London company,
had been in the hotel for about a week.

   World demand for commercial jetliners will keep
soaring into the next century, partly because of new markets for
Western planes in Eastern Europe, The Boeing Co. forecast.
   Boeing officials Friday increased their estimate of demand for
planes to the year 2005 by 27 percent, citing growth in the world
economy, disposable income and Far East air travel.
   For the first time, the world's largest commercial airplane
manufacturer also included Eastern Europe in the projections,
predicting that Warsaw Pact nations would start purchasing planes
from Western manufacturers.
   The Soviet Union was excluded from the forecast.
   The greatest growth is anticipated from carriers with routes
within Asia and between the Far East and Europe or the United
States, and the average plane's capacity also will increase,
according to the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group's annual market
outlook.
   ``We believe that as the world's economies grow and as there is
more disposable income, that will mean an increase in demand,''
said John Hayhurst, vice president of marketing for Boeing
Commercial.
   The increase also reflects the $95 billion in orders placed with
airplane makers last year, more than Boeing had expected, Hayhurst
said.
   The company also forecast no major oil price shocks over the
next 16 years.
   The company's projections pegged jet airplane orders from 1990
to 2005 at 9,935 planes worth $626 billion, 2,097 planes and $136
billion more than in the 16-year forecast issued last year.
   The projections are for all manufacturers, but Boeing expects to
maintain its 54 percent to 55 percent market share, Hayhurst said.
   Hayhurst said the company hopes to launch the new mid-size 777,
a 767 derivative, in the first half of this year. Designers are
``looking seriously'' into whether it will have folding wings to
reduce airport crowding, he said.

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. moved to shore up its
credibility after two oil spills in two days by announcing an
immediate suspension of tanker and barge operations at a major East
Coast coast refinery and distribution center.
   Lee Raymond, president of the New York-based oil giant,
announced Friday evening that marine operations in New Jersey,
where the company operates its only East Coast refinery, would be
halted pending an evaluation of procedures.
   ``We deeply regret the recent accidents at our New Jersey
facilities and the impacts and concerns they have caused,'' Raymond
said in a statement.
   ``We are seriously committed to conducting our operations in a
safe and environmentally responsible manner, and we are taking this
measure to demonstrate that commitment.''
   Exxon said the huge refinery in Linden would essentially be
idled by the move. But the company said alternate supply
arrangements are being made.
   ``Exxon anticipates that gasoline, heating oil, propane and
other products will continue to be made available to customers on
an uninterrupted basis,'' the statement said.
   Exxon spokesman Barry Wood said deliveries by truck of oil
already in the company's storage tanks would not be affected.
   The Bayway refinery in Linden and the Bayonne distribution
center, the third largest of five such Exxon facilities in the
United States, have been the site of three oil spills since Jan. 1.
   The spills have been a major setback in Exxon efforts to
rehabilitate its image since last year's 11-million-gallon spill _
the nation's worst _ in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   ``It was pretty clear that Exxon had lost the confidence of the
public,'' said Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
   Torricelli had written Friday requesting that the company make
voluntary reforms. ``It's a bit better and faster response than I
would have expected.''
   The company's local troubles began Jan. 1, when an underwater
pipeline sprang a leak and spilled 567,000 gallons of heating oil
into the Arthur Kill waterway separating New Jersey from the Staten
Island borough of New York City.
   On Wednesday, a leaking barge owned by a private contractor
spilled 30,000 gallons of heating oil into the Kill Van Kull from
Exxon USA Co.'s Bayonne terminal.
   Then Thursday night, while crews continued their attempts to
contain the previous day's spill, a mechanical fuel line filling a
Texaco barge at the Bayway refinery broke free and spilled about
4,000 gallons of crude oil into the Arthur Kill.
   Coast Guard Capt. Robert North, the officer in charge of New
York Harbor, said Friday that a preliminary investigation into
Thursday's spill had not yet determined whether Exxon was at fault.
   He said it was unclear whether the arm malfunctioned, which
would be Exxon's responsibility, or whether Texaco's hookup on the
barge was faulty. The spill was largely contained by booms and did
not appear to have spread into the harbor, he said.
   But Wednesday's spill was more serious. Cleanup crews continued
collecting tar balls Friday along a 40-mile arc of New York and New
Jersey coastline, North said. Six more dead birds were pulled from
the water, bringing the unofficial tally to about 32 dead.
   The leaking barge was owned by Staten Island-based Eklof Marine
Corp. The Coast Guard said Eklof took responsibility for
Wednesday's spill and its inspectors are probing the cause of the
damaged hull.

   A leader in Pakistan-held Kashmir
said today that Pakistan's Kashmiris will march to the border of
India's troubled state of Jammu-Kashmir to show support of their
brethren's call for independence.
   Sultan Mahmood, president of Azad Moslem Conference, said the
march Friday will only be a ``dress rehearsal'' for a plan to cross
into the Indian state, where more than 160 people have been killed
in protests by Moslem secessionists since Jan. 20.
   ``We are going to cross the cease-fire line very soon, in a
matter of weeks,'' he told a news conference. ``Not only do we
intend to attack them (India), we should also prepare ourselves
defensively. We are in a sort of war situation.''
   He said demonstrators on Friday will march to the Pakistani
border town of Chakhoti.
   Moslem Pakistan and mainly Hindu India have fought three wars
since independence from Britain in 1947 _ twice over Kashmir. The
840-mile cease-fire line is heavily guarded.
   Prime Minsiter Benazir Bhutto's government, while condemning the
Srinagar violence and publicly supporting the militants, has warned
against aggravating the confrontation.
   Last month, Indian troops opened fire on Pakistani
demonstrators, who pushed aside barricades at the border near
Chakhoti and swarmed across. Three people were killed and several
more were wounded. Pakistan and Indian soldiers also exchanged fire
for about 30 minutes before calm was restored.
   Pakistan has since strengthened its border barricades, and the
military has warned Kashmiris that they will stop any attempted
crossing.
   Indian-held Kashmir is India's only state with a Moslem
majority. Its Moslem activists want a separate nation.

   India rushed hundreds of reinforcements
to the Kashmir Valley after the largest-ever Moslem rally against
Indian rule, police and airport sources said today.
   Police today killed a protester in the old downtown area of
Srinagar when 20 to 30 people came out of their homes in defiance
of the curfew imposed Friday, witnesses said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Indian news agencies said the patrolling troops and paramilitary
police had orders to shoot curfew violators on sight.
   Nine planes carrying paramilitary police and border guards
landed at Srinagar airport Friday night and today and more were
expected in northern Jammu-Kashir state, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   In neighboring Pakistan, a leader in the Pakistani-held section
of Kashmir today said Pakistani Kashmiris will march to the border
next Friday in protest and invade Jammu-Kashmir ``in a matter of
weeks.''
   Sultan Mahmood, president of Azad Moslem Conference, made his
comments at a news conference in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.
   At least 49 people were fatally shot Thursday by army and
paramilitary troops as an estimated 1 million Moslem demonstrators
converged on Srinagar to press demands for independence from
predominantly Hindu India, police said.
   Today's shooting raised the death toll to at least 163 in
Kashmir since the latest round of secessionist violence flared Jan.
20.
   In Washington, the State Department said Friday it had appealed
to the Indian government to prevent the use of excessive force
against the pro-independence demonstrators.
   ``We deplore the loss of life in Kashmir. We are disturbed at
the rising number of casualties,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington.
   An Indian government spokesman, speaking on the customary
condition of anonymity, said troops opened fire Thursday in
self-defense. Witnesses, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some of the marchers tried to seize weapons from the
government security forces.
   On Jan. 20, the government launched a crackdown on escalating
protests, bombings and attacks on government intelligence agents
and other officials.
   After the crackdown started, army and paramilitary troops were
beefed up in Srinagar and surrounding towns in the Kashmir Valley
next to the Pakistani frontier.
   Some of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force and Border
Security Guards were withdrawn during legislative elections Tuesday
in eight other Indian states. These troops were returning now, the
airport and police sources said.
   Each plane landing at Srinagar airport carried about 100 men,
they added.
   Heightened security also was in evidence in downtown Srinagar,
center of the militant movement. For a week preceding the
imposition of the curfew, processions ranging from about 20,000 to
1 million demonstrators had converged on the office of the U.N.
military observer group that has been assigned to the
Indian-Pakistani frontier for the past 40 years because of the two
nations' dispute over Kashmir.
   Pakistan, an overwhelmingly Moslem nation, claimed Kashmir and
twice went to war with India over the question of the predominantly
Moslem valley's sovereignty.
   The Kashmir Valley is governed by India as part of Jammu-Kashmir
state, the only Indian state with a Moslem majority. The western
slice of Kashmir is under Pakistani control. Both countries claim
all of Kashmir.
   Initially, Kashmiri separatists on the Indian side of the
disputed frontier had pressed for union with Pakistan. But in the
past year their call for secession has been coupled with demands
for Kashmir's independence as a buffer nation between India, the
region's military and political giant, and its long-time adversary,
Pakistan. The two nations were once ruled as one unit by colonial
Britain. But upon independence in 1947, they were partitioned along
religious lines.
   The Kashmir section of India's Jammu-Kashmir state is mostly
Moslem, while the southern Jammu region is mostly Hindu. Overall,
Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 6 million people.
   But nationwide, Moslems form only 12 percent of India's 880
million people, of whom 82 percent are Hindus.

   Scores of Moslem militants stoned two
Coptic Christian churches and a youth club in a southern Egyptian
town, injuring 15 people, a town official said today.
   The state-run Middle East News Agency distributed a report
making no mention of those attacks but saying the fundamentalists
burned a Coptic-owned candy plant, a neighboring timber depot and
four cars.
   The town official said the attacks occurred Friday at
Abu-Kurkas, 150 miles south of Cairo in El-Minya province. El-Minya
lies just north of Assiut, which has had frequent episodes of
violence involving Moslem militants for nearly a decade.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said almost
100 militants threw stones at the churches and a nearby Coptic
youth club, smashing windows and slightly injuring 15 worshipers.
   The assaults, he said, came during Coptic prayer services
customarily held during a 55-day period of fasting preceding Coptic
Easter, which this year coincides with Western Easter on April 15.
   Police detained 45 attackers and were seeking another 45, the
official said.
   Police Maj. Gen. Maher Hassan Ibrahim, El-Minya's provincial
security chief, referred questions to the Interior Ministry in
Cairo, which is responsible for internal security. The ministry
spokesman's office also refused to discuss the attacks but said a
statement might be issued later.
   The government news agency report, which appeared to be an
Interior Ministry handout, blamed the trouble on ``members of
extremist groups,'' the ministry's standard euphemism for Moslem
militants. It put the number of detainees at 37.
   The agency said militants last week abducted the son of the
candy plant owner ``on suspicion of having a love affair with a
Moslem girl.'' It said a friend of the son also was kidnapped with
him.
   Quoting Interior Ministry sources, the agency said Friday's
arson attack followed the arrest of the alleged kidnappers and
release of the two captives.
   In Cairo, the state-owned newspaper Al-Gomhouria reported that
the attackers tried unsuccessfully to set fire to the churches.
``Security authorities brought the situation under control,'' the
newspaper said.

   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner
said today he favored calling a special meeting of foreign
ministers of the Western alliance to discuss German unification and
arms control.
   Smaller nations in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have
complained about being left out of discussions among the four NATO
powers on uniting Germany and suggested an emergency conference.
   ``I personally favor the idea,'' Woerner said at NATO
headquarters after meeting with Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier of
Czechoslovakia.
   ``We could have very useful discussions on (conventional arms)
negotiations, and we could have discussions and an exchange of
views about the process of German unification.''
   Woerner said no final decision has been made or date set for a
special meeting. But a NATO official, demanding anonymity, said
dates in April have been discussed.
   The decision by France, Britain, the United States and the
Soviet Union to meet separately to discuss German unity has angered
some allies, including Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands.
   Under the ``two-plus-four'' process set up by the four
victorious World War II powers, the two German states also will
meet after March 18 elections in East Germany to discuss their
future.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will travel to NATO on
Thursday to talk to ambassadors of the 16 alliance nations about
German unification.
   Woerner said Kohl's visit showed the ``the importance he
attributes to consulting with all allies. ... So I think all those
who are thinking that this process will only be restricted to the
two-plus-four structure are wrong.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. and South Korean military
engineers cut through nine feet of granite today to unearth a
tunnel allegedly dug by North Korea under the Demilitarized Zone
separating the two Koreas.
   The tunnel was discovered in a remote mountainous border area
called Punchbowl, the site of a fierce battle between U.S. and
Communist troops during the 1950-53 Korean War.
   ``Breaking through!'' shouted onlookers as engineers with giant
drills and earth-moving equipment succeeded in reaching the tunnel.
   In Seoul, Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon told a news conference
the tunnel, located about 100 miles northeast of the capital, is
``a southward tunnel that can be used for...invasion.''
   The tunnel is the fourth to be found since 1974.
   But Lee said his ministry believed there were more than 20 being
dug by North Korea inside the 2.5-mile-wide, 155-mile-long DMZ, one
of the most heavily armed borders in the world.
   South Korean officials claim North Korean leader Kim Il Sung
ordered the tunnels built to infiltrate Communist troops behind
South Korea's first defense lines. North Korea has denied digging
any tunnels.
   A statement issued by the U.S.-led United Nations Command said
the tunnel was ``apparently dug by North Korea to invade the
South.''
   It said the tunnel was six feet high and six feet wide, large
enough for three armed soldiers to run through it side by side. A
full regiment could pass through the tunnel in an hour, officials
said.
   The man-made tunnel is 430 feet beneath the surface, the defense
minister said. He said its length and age were not yet known.
   ``In view of the changing global situation and our sincere peace
initiatives, the construction of such a tunnel into our area across
the truce line is a serious violation of the armistice agreement
and an intolerable act of aggression,'' Lee said.
   He urged North Korea to stop ``provocative acts of aggression''
and help pursue ways to cut tensions on the divided Korean
peninsula.
   Col. H.T. Linke, spokesman for the United Nations Command, said
the tunnel was first detected after a U.S. Army investigation team
drilled into a tunnel-like cavity on Christmas Eve.
   Closer observation confirmed the probability that a tunnel
existed, and work to confirm suspicions began Dec. 30, 1989, Linke
said. ``This also confirmed our belief that North Korea has
constructed other tunnels across the frontline,'' Linke said.
   South Korea found three tunnels, allegedly dug by North Korea
across the border, in 1974, 1975 and 1978. Two of them were
discovered near the truce village of Panmunjom, 35 miles north of
Seoul.
   A third tunnel found in 1978 near Panmunjom was dug through
granite nearly 500 feet below the surface and extends 1,300 feet
into South Korean territory across the border. It has been open to
the public.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945 after World War II. North Korea
invaded South Korea in 1950 to start the three-year Korean War. The
two countries remain technically at war. Despite sporadic dialogue,
they remain arch enemies. No unauthorized travel or communication
is allowed between citizens of the two sides.

   Marchers assembled to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of voting rights march to Montgomery kicked off the
weekend with a parade for a new cause.
   The 300 marchers focused their protest Friday on the dismissal
of Selma's first black school superintendent by the six whites on
the 11-member school board.
   ``What is happening in Selma threatens education across the
nation,'' said the Rev. Ben Chavis Jr. , executive director of the
Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ in
Cleveland, Ohio.
   The weekend's activities include a re-enactment Sunday of the
1965 march to Alabama's capital that helped prompt Congress to pass
the Voting Rights Act. The law allowed blacks across the South to
register to vote free of intimidation or rules designed to block
them from the ballot box.
   The focus of Friday's march, however, was the school board's
decision not to renew Superintendent Norward Roussell's contract
when it expires in June. Protesters contend he is being fired in
part because he dismantled a ``tracking'' system that tended to
create segregated classrooms, with blacks placed on slower tracks
in the 6,000-student system, which is 70 percent black.
   The marchers gathered outside Selma High School when classes let
out Friday. When the crowd reached the Edmund Pettus Bridge _ scene
of a confrontation in 1965 _ marchers knelt in prayer.
   Later, the marchers stopped outside the Selma school board
building, where Roussell was cheered when he said Selma ``has a
message for the rest of the country and the world. And that message
is we will not allow our children to enter the 21st century
undereducated or miseducated.''
   The school board cited an evalution critical of Roussell's
managerial skills for dismissing him. He contends the evaluation is
unsubstantiated.

<HEAD>Reports Say Labor Minister Received Money from Recruit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of Japan's new Cabinet has acknowledged
receiving money from the company at the center of a widespread
influence-buying scandal, major newspapers reported today.
   Labor Minister Shunpei Tsukahara told Japanese reporters Friday
that the Recruit Co. bought $42,000 in tickets to his fund-raising
events in 1984-88, the Asahi Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
   Tsukahara is the first member of the new Cabinet, other than
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, to be linked to the Recruit scandal.
   Recruit Co. gave large donations and underpriced stock to dozens
of prominent people, causing a public uproar that led to the
resignations of numerous business and political figures.
   Kaifu has dedicated his new administration to political reform
and said he would not pick anyone for his Cabinet who was tainted
by the scandal. He formed the Cabinet Feb. 27.
   Tsukahara said he told his staff to investigate his financial
records when he learned he was being considered for a Cabinet
position in late February, the newspapers reported. They quoted
Tsukahara as saying he was surprised to learn about his relations
with Recruit, an information and publishing conglomerate, and
decided to make them public.
   Tsukahara said he had not yet informed Kaifu of the fund-raising
ticket purchases, the newspapers said. Kaifu left Friday for the
United States for talks with President Bush.
   Repeated telephone calls today to Tsukahara's home and office
went unanswered, and he could not be reached for comment on the
reports.
   Kaifu was chosen prime minister in August after the Recruit
scandal and a series of sex scandals rocked the governing Liberal
Democrats and swept two prime ministers from power.
   Kaifu told a news conference when he first took office that he
had received nearly $97,000 from Recruit, all in legal donations.
But in its current issue, the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun said
it had obtained a list from Recruit which said Kaifu received
$177,000 from the company in 1983-87.

   The six members of an international expedition
arrived today at a Soviet base on Antarctica's eastern coast,
completing what organizers called the longest unmechanized crossing
of the forbidding continent.
   ``I'm feeling great happiness and great relief at the end of
seven difficult months,'' co-leader Jean-Louis Etienne of France
said in a live interview on French television moments after the
arrival just after 1 p.m. Paris time (7 a.m. EST).
   In a hookup with reporters in Paris, Etienne said he was looking
forward to returning to normal life. He said that apart from his
companions and the dogs that pulled the sleds, he saw only three
animals, all birds.
   ``I want to see nature. I want to see living things,'' Etienne
said.
   The arrival ended a seven-month, 3,800-mile trek by ski and
dogsled that risked turning to tragedy at the very close.
   Keizo Funatsu of Japan disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours
before being found by his worried fellow adventurers Friday morning.
   On Feb. 12, Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner and West German
adventurer Arved Fuchs completed what they said was a 1,699-mile
crossing of Antarctica on foot, without the use of sled dogs. They
are expected to arrive in Frankfurt later this month to provide
details of their journey.
   The television images showed the final steps of the latest
expedition live. The men in their bright red and blue suits stood
out against the white snow as they and their 30 dogs reached a sign
marked ``Finish'' in English by the gray waters of the Indian Ocean.
   Six national flags flapped in the wind representing the
countries of the participants. Besides Funatsu and Etienne, the
team members were co-leader Will Steger of Ely, Minn., Victor
Boyarsky of the Soviet Union, Geoff Somers of Britain and Quin Dahe
from China.
   The expedition was intended to generate support for Antarctica's
preservation and to demonstrate the power of international
cooperation.
   To attract attention, the team decided to attempt the first
unmechanized crossing, using only dogsleds to help them transport
their supplies and equipment.
   On Dec. 11, the team reached their halfway point, becoming the
first to reach the South Pole by dogsled since Roald Amundsen
discovered the pole in 1911.
   The journey began July 28 near the tip of the Antarctic
Peninsula, which reaches out toward South America, and ended at the
Soviet science station on the Indian Ocean at Mirnyy. But Etienne
said in a television interview that the toughest part came earlier.
   ``The first two months were very, very hard,'' he said. ``We
started to doubt after a month whether we would make it.''
   He described Antarctica as ``huge and sometimes monstrous.''
   President Bush sent a letter of contratulations to the team and
invited members to the White House.
   ``Your spirit of international friendship and cooperation not
only helped make this fantastic journey possible but also set a
wonderful example for the world community of nations,'' Bush said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand sent a message of
congratulations to Etienne, calling the trek ``a human adventure
and a scientific testimony of the importance of the Antarctic
continent for our environment.''
   Mitterrand said he was looking forward to welcoming the six team
members in Paris on March 21.
   It had been feared that deteriorating weather would keep the
adventurers on the continent for as long as a month and jeopardize
an elaborate international tour to tout the expedition later this
month.
   But winds that reached 73 mph pushed the harbor ice apart,
leaving a path for the Professor Zubov, a ship that is to take them
to New Zealand. Soviet Antarctic officials in Leningrad told Cathy
DeMoll, the expedition's manager in Paris, that unless conditions
change, loading of the ship will begin Monday.
   ``They're talking about using lifeboats to carry everyone to the
ship,'' DeMoll said. ``The trouble is, we don't know how dangerous
that will be. We just don't know what's going to happen. We're
completely at the mercy of the weather.''
   The wind was howling at 70 mph and the temperature was 20 below
zero when Funatsu left a Soviet mobile home where he was meeting
with a French film crew Thursday, spokeswoman Jennifer Gasperini
said from St. Paul, Minn.
   When Funatsu did not arrive back in his tent for dinner, team
members tied themselves together and made a search of the area
until 10 p.m., when they gave up because of darkness, Gasperini
said. The search resumed at 4 a.m. Friday, and Funatsu was found
about two hours later, she said.
   Etienne said that when expedition members came by calling
``Keizo, Keizo, Keizo,'' Funatsu ``jumped out like a mushroom from
the snow. He was in very good shape.''
   ``He had survived by digging a hole in the snow and crawling
inside, just as the dogs do each night to stay warm,'' said
Gasperini, who received the news from support staff.
   Team members ``were quite shook up by what happened,'' Gasperini
said, explaining that in such blizzards it's easy to lose all sense
of orientation, even in a small area.
   ``It's an extremely frightening situation,'' she said.

<HEAD>Governor Backing Off Plan to Join Maryland and D.C.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer is
beginning to think his proposal to annex the District of Columbia
wasn't such a good idea after all.
   A week ago, Schaefer proposed joining the nation's capital with
the Free State _ an idea that drew both laughs and sharp criticism
from D.C. statehood advocates and elected officials in Maryland and
Virginia.
   Within several days, Schaefer was saying: ``I'm not going to
push this.''
   ``We have enough problems in Maryland dealing with one major
urban center, and that's Baltimore,'' said Thomas V. Miller, a
Democrat who heads Maryland's Senate. ``We certainly can't take on
Washington, D.C., with its attendant problems.''
   From Virginia, which absorbed a chunk of the district back in
1846, came smiles and skepticism.
   ``It amuses me to see the governor of Maryland say they can take
care of the district better than it can take care of itself,'' said
Virginia state Del. Leslie L. Byrne of suburban Falls Church. ``I
think he was talking off the top of his head.''
   ``I can't see why Maryland would want it,'' said another
Virginia legislator, Sen. Robert L. Calhoun, R-Alexandria.
   Such has been the reaction since Schaefer said last Sunday that
he would entertain the notion of having the nation's capital
absorbed by Maryland.
   Schaefer's remarks caught many people by surprise, especially in
view of the negative headlines Washington has attracted lately.
   The mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, has been indicted on
cocaine and perjury charges, and poor neighborhoods of the city are
awash in drug-related murders. A ``broad range of allegations''
involving Barry is continuing, according to U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens.
   Meanwhile, District officials are struggling to control growing
budget deficits while city prisons operate under court orders to
control overcrowding.
   Some of Schaefer's critics, including the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson,
accused him of racism.
   ``Really what he's proposing is a kind of Bantustan concept,''
said Jackson. The term refers to South Africa's policy of separate
communities for blacks. ``As we end Bantustans in South Africa, we
do not want to transfer them to Washington. The issue here is
sovereignty, self-respect.''
   Maryland's flamboyant governor was quick to defend himself.
Schaefer said financial gains that would come from annexing a city
that, with a population of nearly 700,000, has more taxpayers than
five states.
   ``It was a good intention. Now it's being interpreted as racism
and all the rest. That's not true,'' Schaefer said.
   Jackson, who has taken up the cause of D.C. statehood, says full
voting rights for the nation's capital is the only acceptable plan.
   ``The people of Washington want self-determination,'' said Frank
Watkins, a top aide to Jackson. He said the idea of annexation ``is
offensive to the people of the District of Columbia and Maryland.''
   The House did pass a proposed constitutional amendment in 1978
to allow D.C. statehood, but the measure expired after being
ratified by just 16 of the required 37 states.

   Atlantis will end its secret
military mission by landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at
1:08 p.m. Sunday, NASA said today in an announcement that briefly
broke a news blackout on the flight.
   ``The crew is doing well and beginning landing preparations and
the orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily,'' the space agency
said in the terse announcement.
   The anouncement made no assessment of weather conditions for the
Sunday landing. Forecasts call for a Pacific Ocean storm to move
into the landing site area in southern California.
   NASA sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
five-member, all-military crew of Atlantis on Thursday released
into orbit a $500 million spy satellite.
   The satellite is designed to take detailed pictures of the
Soviet Union, including areas never before viewed by
shuttle-launched satellites, sources said. It also is able to tune
into electronic communications worldwide.
   ``We can safely assume there are no problems'' as long as
Mission Control does not interrupt the silence, said Bruce
Buckingham, a spokesman for the space agency.
   NASA has not released details of astronaut activities aboard
Atlantis, which was launched Wednesday, because the shuttle is on a
classified Department of Defense mission.
   But Jeff Carr, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in
Houston, said that if the astronauts follow shuttle mission
routine, Friday was the final full day to complete the secret
objectives.
   Astronauts generally clean up and start dismantling and stowing
equipment the day before landing, Carr said.
   They also must test the reaction control jets and check other
critical systems that Atlantis will need as it plunges through
Earth's atmosphere.
   A general inspection of the solid rocket boosters has not
revealed any abnormalities, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone. But
``we really won't know until they're taken apart,'' she said.
   The boosters were recovered from the Atlantic Ocean where they
fell after liftoff early Wednesday morning, NASA's sixth attempt to
launch the spaceship in less than a week. The boosters will be
disassembled and refurbished for later use.
   The 1986 Challenger disaster was caused by a failed solid rocket
booster.
   Atlantis' flight is 34th shuttle mission and the sixth dedicated
solely to the military.
   Navy Capt. John O. Creighton is commander of the mission,
piloted by Air Force Col. John H. Casper with mission specialists
Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane
and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.

   A small black axe hangs just inside the door to
Veniamin Gaufberg's apartment. Reinforcement strips glisten in the
door's frame.
   The gaunt, 69-year-old Jew who fought the Nazis in World War II
is preparing for a new battle against racial attacks.
   ``If they open the door, I'll cut off their fingers. What else
can I do?'' asked Gaufberg.
   Although not all have resorted to axes, Gaufberg is typical of
Soviet Jews anguished by what they say is a resurgence of
anti-Semitism dating back centuries. Like record numbers of his
countrymen, Gaufberg has had enough and is planning to leave his
homeland for good, something he vowed he would never do.
   ``I have one goal now: to survive until the day I leave,'' he
said in the western Moscow apartment he shares with four relatives.
   Jewish writers have been beaten, anti-Jewish graffiti has
appeared, and hate-mongers openly distribute leaflets that borrow
from Hitler to condemn the ``Zionist menace'' and call for attacks
on Jews.
   Even the official press has carried blatantly anti-Semitic
articles.
   Alexander Bushkov wrote in the newspaper Krasnoyarsk Komsomolets
last June that Jews in the Soviet leadership ``participated in all
the cases of genocide against the Russian people.''
   No recent mob violence against the Soviet Union's 1.4 million
Jews has been reported, but rumors and threats of pogroms, or
organized racial attacks, are instilling a strong sense of danger,
even panic.
   It has added to a Jewish exodus of unprecedented proportions.
Aided by easier Soviet emigration policies, about 71,000 Soviet
Jews left last year, the highest annual total since the 1967 Middle
East War began a new wave of emigration. Nearly 5,000 left in
January.
   ``Everyone I know is planning to run away, wherever possible,''
said Gaufberg.
   ``The situation is so intolerable. Every day I feel it,'' said
Roza Gutman, a 23-year-old Jew from the Crimea. Huddled in a crowd
of would-be emigres at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, waiting to learn
whether she and her family would be allowed to enter the United
States, she explained the forces driving them away.
   She entered a Moscow music teachers' college because she felt
that as a Jew, she stood little chance of being accepted at the
more prestigious conservatory. But today there is greater danger
than discrimination.
   Gutman said she is considering buying a gun to protect herself
from threats, which she said included vandalism to her dormitory
room and shouts from classmates to ``clear out of our country!''
   ``It's become so acute that every Sunday, my friends say there
will be a pogrom and don't go out,'' she said.
   ``Now it's simply dangerous. There's an elementary threat to
life,'' she said.
   In December, the Soviet Union's first national Jewish congress
in decades condemned the ``orgy of anti-Semitism'' sweeping the
country and said it was causing an ``unprecedented panic among the
Jewish population.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberalization drive has been a
mixed blessing for Soviet Jews. It has allowed freer emigration and
the opportunity to practice their religion and culture without
official harassment. But it has also allowed Russian nationalists
to speak out, in some cases with anti-Semitic messages. The
worsening economy and political upheaval of Gorbachev's rule have
caused many Soviets to look for scapegoats, and Jews have been
prime targets.
   Some Jews, like Gutman, suspect high-level complicity in
anti-Semitism, but can offer little proof. The record of the
country's previous rulers, however, is far from clean.
   Czar Nicholas I said in 1816, nine years before ascending the
throne, that Jews were ``full-fledged leeches,'' and his regime
portrayed Jewish traders as exploiters of the masses. Czarist
forces either stood by or participated in beatings, murders and
looting of apartments of Jews in pogroms of the 1880s and early
1900s.
   After the Soviets took power, with strong support and
participation of Jews, Jews no longer were confined to a section of
Russia known as the Pale. And although it was poorly enforced, a
1918 decree signed by Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin outlawed
anti-Semitism.
   His successor, Josef Stalin, however, launched a campaign
against ``cosmopolitanism'' after World War II, in which Jews were
arrested and executed.
   The official Soviet encyclopedia boasted in 1953 that Soviet
policy ``led to the disappearance of the `Jewish question,''' but
anti-Semitism continued. Jews faced discrimination in education,
jobs and the practice of their religion.
   The government has been accused to taking a lax attitude toward
the threats. Authorities have countered with a propaganda campaign
of their own.
   The regional Communist Party chief in Odessa went on television
in late January to report that a commission ``condemned nationalist
and chauvinist activity'' in the Black Sea port, which has a large
Jewish population. Leaflets quoting Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' and
calling for Jewish pogroms had been spread in Odessa.
   In Moscow, the Interior Ministry said rumors of impending
pogroms are unfounded, and that Soviet press articles reporting the
threats ``mislead the public and can serve to promote ethnic strife
and destabilization.''
   The strongest official response has been the filing of criminal
charges of ``inciting national and racial hatred and strife''
against Pamyat, the Russian nationalist group linked to the wave of
anti-Semitism. The weekly newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta said the
charges were filed after Pamyat published a statement that said in
part, ``Jews and their relatives must not be allowed to defend
dissertations, to acquire knowledge and get academic titles, to
join the Soviet Communist Party.''
   About 50 people, identified in the official press as Pamyat
members, stormed a meeting of a liberal writers group Jan. 18 in
Moscow and beat participants, some of them Jews. An account in the
magazine Ogonyok said the attackers called them Zhids _ a
derogatory term for Jews _ and vowed, ``Today we came with a
megaphone; the next time it will be with machine guns.''

   Fire swept through a home outside
Pittsburgh early today, killing a man and five children hours after
a birthday party for one of the victims, officials said.
   Another man pulled from the burning home by police was
hospitalized.
   Allegheny County homicide Lt. John Brennan said it appeared the
fire broke out on the first floor of the three-story house but the
cause was under investigation. Turtle Creek is 10 miles east of
Pittsburgh.
   The 2 a.m. fire spread to two adjoining homes, but their
residents escaped.
   Officials tentatively identified the dead as James Bennett, 23;
Joshua Harris, 8; Carly Harris, 6; Jessie Harris, 4; Terrance
Cleary, about 5; and Amanda Lee Cleary, about 3.
   Brennan said the Cleary children had attended Joshua's 8th
birthday party and were staying overnight.
   Dusty Harris, 26, mother of the Harris children, was visiting
neighbors and saw the fire when she left. Patrolman Frank Leonardo
said when he arrived at the burning house, ``a woman was screaming,
`My babies are in there, my babies are in there.''
   Leonardo and four other officers tried to get in through the
front door and a side window but were driven back by smoke and
flames. Then they kicked in a back door.
   ``Because of the heavy smoke, we got down on our hands and knees
and crawled in, where we saw a guy laying there about 15 feet from
the door and we drug him out,'' he said.
   The injured man was taken to West Penn Hospital. The hospital
declined to identify him or give any information on his condition.

<HEAD>Christians Flee Enclave During Cease-Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lines of cars and pickups piled high with
mattresses, clothes and household goods snaked out of Christian
east Beirut on Saturday during a cease-fire in the battle for
control of the Christian enclave.
   Sniper fire crackled, despite the cease-fire, but there were no
reports of new casualties.
   Police said civil defense teams evacuated 12 dead and 26 wounded
from the battered districts of Nabaa and Sin el-Fil during the
night after the fighting between Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and the
Lebanese Forces militia subsided.
   That raised the overall casualty toll since the battles began
Jan.30 to at least 766 killed and 2,087 wounded.
   The cease-fire took effect at 9 p.m. Friday after Maronite
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir threatened to excommunicate the fighters
and their leaders if they did not stop shooting.
   Both Aoun and his rival, Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea,
are Maronites, the Christian sect that has dominated Lebanon since
independence from France in 1943.
   Sfeir, speaking at a peace rally in Bkirki north of Beirut,
lashed out at the antagonists and declared: ``A Christian worships
God. He loves, has mercy on and helps his relative. He does not
kill him, humiliate him or make him homeless.''
   The battle for dominance in the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave has driven one-fifth of the area's 1 million inhabitants
from their homes to relative safety elsewhere.
   A woman carrying a suitcase in one hand and a plastic bag of
food in the other shepherded three children across Beirut's
dividing Green Line into the Moslem sector. ``They've made us
homeless. Only God is left for us now,'' she wailed.
   Another woman lugging three suitcases yelled at one of Aoun's
soldiers on the Christian side of the 3-mile-long demarcation line,
``Finish this war!''
   ``Go tell the patriarch,'' he answered coldly.
   Christians were also fleeing by ferry for the east Mediterranean
island of Cyprus, 100 miles to the northwest.
   Most Christians feared the fighting would flare again, because
Aoun appears determined to eliminate Geagea's militia, which has
6,000 fighters and thousands of reservists.
   Aoun has about 19,000 soldiers and has demanded Geagea disband
his militia and merge it with Aoun's army to create a political
organization. Geagea refuses.
   The cease-fire, the latest in a series of truces that have been
either ignored or broken, ended 36 hours of fierce battles around
the districts of Nabaa and Sin el-Fil.
   Aoun moved against Geagea at dawn Thursday with his U.S.-made
M-48 tanks and advanced 200 yards to the edge of the districts, but
he was blocked from moving into the narrow alleys of the two
quarters.
   Aoun apparently was seeking to oust Geagea's strongholds to
reach the wide coastal highway so he could attack the militia's
headquarters in the Karantina district and the nearby Beirut port.
   The strategic 12-story Shalouhi building that once housed the
offices of several Western companies was in a no man's land. It
changed hands several times Thursday and Friday in savage
room-to-room fighting.
   Aoun's headquarters said in a communique that he withdrew his
forces as a ``goodwill gesture'' so mediators could resume efforts
to work out a settlement.

   The appeal came from loudpseakers strung
across mosques and by word of mouth: ``100,000 people have taken
shelter in mosques. They are hungry. We need food.''
   Within minutes, Moslem housewives collected their pots and pans.
Within an hour, huge dinners of rice and vegetable curry were ready.
   The food was passed from hand to hand across narrow alleys and
from rooftop to rooftop to avoid Indian patrols, until it reached
the mosques that dot this city of nearly 1 million people.
   ``The appeal was for food, and it came. If the appeal goes for
giving one's life, that will come too,'' said Mohammad Ramzan, a
74-year-old retired government employee.
   Moslems in the Kashmir Valley seem ready for a full-scale battle
for independence. The relay of food was Thursday, the day
government troops shot and killed at least 49 Moslems during
marches by about a million Moslems demanding secession from
Hindu-dominated India.
   It was the largest demonstration for secession ever in the
Kashmir Valley, a Moslem-dominated region where residents have
chafed and periodically broken into violence over Indian rule for
the last four decades.
   ``Thursday was the watershed in the Indian government's efforts
to keep the area under Indian control,'' said a local Moslem
policeman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Look at this,'' he said, pointing at his police uniform.
``Inside this uniform there is a Kashmiri first and a policeman
later. I am no more an Indian, and I will never pick up arms
against my brother Kashmiris.''
   Urged on by militants, Moslems are starting to reject everything
that is Indian.
   Billboards with the word ``India'' have been vandalized. Indian
banks report low business. Many residents have set back their
watches half an hour to correspond with the time in neighboring _
and Islamic _ Pakistan.
   Many people have stopped wearing wristwatches, fearful of
offending either the militants or the government.
   ``Why take undue risk? I just don't wear a wristwatch anymore,''
a hotel doorman said.
   In the last few days a new directive went out to shopkeepers: Do
not accept Indian currency. Instead, use the Pakistani currency
that Indian sources say the militants are smuggling into Kashmir.
   ``Yes, we have heard about the directive not to accept Indian
currency, but I don't think it has been put to practice,'' said an
employee at one of Srinagar's top hotels.
   ``Indian currency is still legal tender, but if the campaign
goes on the way it is going now, the day is not far off when we may
have to refuse Indian money,'' he said, asking that neither he nor
his hotel be identified.
   Under orders from the main Islamic militant group, the
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, Srinagar's liquor shops closed or
switched to selling other merchandise. Cinemas have closed, and one
theater owner said he was thinking of converting his theater to a
cold storage depot for potatoes.
   The refrain of independence reverberates throughout the city.
   ``Before, we _ the Kashmiris _ used to think that independence
was not possible. But now we think it is not only possible, but it
is only a matter of time,'' a Moslem high school teacher said on
condition of anonynity.
   ``It is sort of Romania in the making,'' he said, comparing the
Kashmir independence movement to the crumbling of the
long-entrenched Communist Party regimes in Eastern Europe.
   But Indian officials said fear, not genuine feelings, has driven
most people to join the demonstrations.
   ``These are stage-managed for the press,'' said Jagmohan, the
federally appointed governor of Jammu-Kashmir state, where
escalating violence by separatist groups prompted a massive
government crackdown Jan. 20. More than 160 people have died since
then, and most have been Moslem protesters shot by government
troops.
   ``The number of hard-core terrorists will be at best 300 to
400,'' said Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses only one name, as he spoke
in the heavily fortified governor's palace. ``The so-called
sympathy you see is just a show, and some are out of fear.''
   Events outside seemed to contradict this.
   ``I have never seen anything like that in my life,'' said Rahul
Kapoor, referring to Thursday's processions of pro-independence
demonstrators.
   ``My God, it was like a revolution,'' said Kapoor, a Hindu
businessman from New Delhi.

<HEAD>Baker Brand of Personal Diplomacy Brings Grumbling in Foggy Bottom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A State Department official assigned to
monitor dealings with a certain country heard rumors recently that
his boss, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, was going to visit
that country.
   Unable to confirm the rumors through official channels, the
official hit on the idea of asking the department's pool of
interpreters if they had seen correspondence to the capital in
question.
   Bingo! They had seen enough to confirm his suspicions.
   His ploy was one of many ingenious methods devised by department
aides frustrated by lack of access to Baker and a coterie of senior
advisers who have held the reins of U.S. foreign policy for the
past 13 months.
   Not since the Henry Kissinger era in the 1970s has decision
making been such a private affair among a handful of officials on
the seventh floor of the cavernous State Department building.
   Baker, a Texas attorney whose personal and political bonds with
George Bush date back 20 years, prizes secrecy and direct telephone
diplomacy with foreign leaders is not unusual.
   ``He believes that's the best way of doing things,'' said an
aide familiar with Baker's style. ``You can't deal with delicate
issues in a broad circle. Leaks endanger success.''
   Access to Baker is a rare and valued commodity at Foggy Bottom.
One of the half-dozen or so officials with easy access is
department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. She was also his
spokeswoman when he was Treasury secretary in the Reagan
administration and she worked for Bush in 1980 presidential
campaign.
   In her first briefing to the State Department press corps last
February, Tutwiler apologized for her limited knowledge of foreign
affairs. But she added, ``I do know this president and this
secretary of state very well.''
   For those out of the loop, especially officials who served under
Baker's predecessor, George Shultz, the adjustment has been
difficult.
   Many are awaiting assignments that will take them abroad _ and
possibly into jobs with less frustration. But for those whose
careers will keep them here for several years, disgruntlement is
running high.
   None of the officials interviewed agreed to have their names
used, but their complaints were uniform.
   Shultz, an economics professor who has returned to university
life, chose his close aides from the ranks of the career foreign
service and relied on senior bureaucrats to help shape policy.
   Baker, who brought all his aides with him from outside the
department, is ``his own point man on most major issues,'' said one
senior foreign service officer.
   When Baker wants to nudge Israel and Egypt toward the
negotiating table, he phones his counterparts in those countries.
He has 41 telephone extensions in his office.
   Officials at the Bureau of Near East Affairs, which includes the
Middle East, are generally kept in the dark about high-level talks.
Several have said they learn of developments by reading the
newspapers or from ambassadors from Mideast countries.
   When Baker went to Capitol Hill last March to negotiate a Contra
aid agreement, ``very few people in this building knew about it,''
said an aide.
   When reporters heard that Bush was about to announce a proposal
for troop cuts in Europe in January, a senior arms control official
said he knew nothing about it.
   ``I can assure you that only three people in this building
know,'' said a close Baker associate.
   When Bush prepared to announce arms cuts in Europe last June,
U.S. representatives at NATO headquarters in Brussels were learned
about it from European colleagues.
   ``They (the Europeans) knew about it before we did here in the
building because Baker briefed the allies,'' said one official.
   ``It's like reading tea leaves,'' said the official. ``Baker
wants to control everything.''
   To which the secretary's close aide replied: ``That's his
perogative.''
   The aide denied that Baker shuts himself off from other
opinions. On his visit to West Germany last December, the U.S.
ambassador in East Germany repeatedly pressed Baker to add Potsdam
and a meeting with Prime Minister Hans Modrow to his agenda.
   Baker was undecided until the last minute but finally decided to
go and become the first U.S. secretary of State to venture into
East Germany beyond East Berlin.
   ``It was good advice, and the secretary was happy he took it,''
said the aide.

<HEAD>Congress Poised to Change Gramm-Rudman Budget Law _ Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress and the White House are all but
certain to make changes this year in the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, which has dominated debate over the federal
budget since its enactment in 1985.
   If the revisions are major, it would be the second time in its
short life that the legislation _ designed to gradually force a
balanced budget _ has been substantially altered.
   The changes will at the very least be forced by an issue that
lawmakers have been fixated on in recent weeks: the gigantic
surpluses accumulated each year by the Social Security trust fund.
   But with Gramm-Rudman's declining annual deficit targets
scheduled to expire in fiscal 1993, when the budget is supposed to
be balanced, there are other cross-currents as well.
   Conservatives want to extend the deficit targets into later
years to hold down spending for domestic programs. Liberals want to
eliminate the targets soon so that social spending can expand, and
they want to have the Pentagon budget and taxes play a greater role
in cutting the deficit.
   ``There are about 100 ideas in this place about how the process
will be changed,'' says Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser, D-Tenn.
   The driving force for the changes is the ever-growing Social
Security surplus, expected to be $74 billion next year alone.
   Critics _ and it's become hard to find members of Congress not
sharply critical _ say this surplus makes the overall federal
deficit appear smaller than it actually is, easing the political
pressure to address the budget shortfall.
   The Congressional Budget Office projects the deficit for fiscal
1991 _ which begins Oct. 1 _ at $138 billion. Take out the
retirement funds and the shortfall would be $212 billion.
   Almost everyone on Capitol Hill believes lawmakers will act this
year to remove the Social Security surpluses from the deficit
calculations.
   ``We believe we should separate the Social Security trust funds
from the budget, and we will enact the legislation to do so,''
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said last week.
   But that raises another problem.
   Gramm-Rudman already requires that the federal deficit be sliced
by about $37 billion next year . Unless the law's target is raised
_ as seems likely _ removing Social Security surpluses from the
arithmetic would force lawmakers to find $111 billion in savings, a
task considered politically impossible and risky to the economy.
   ``A certain set of dominoes begin to fall here,'' says House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``If the first
decision is to move Social Security off Gramm-Rudman calculations,
that inevitably leads you to confront what you do with the
remaining large deficit.''
   More complex proposals to change the law are also under
consideration, but all share a common element: the retirement
system's surpluses would no longer be included when the deficit is
added up.
   Sasser and Panetta have each offered their own plans, both of
which would put off some of the fiscal pressure. Republican
congressional leaders are working with the White House on a GOP
alternative. Other members of both parties also have submitted
legislation.
   The target of all this is a law enacted in the middle of the
Reagan administration, when the conservative president and
Democrats in Congress fought to repeated budget standoffs.
   With deficits growing out of control _ they peaked at $221
billion in fiscal 1986 _ Gramm-Rudman was enacted. A series of
declining deficit targets were set, leading to a balanced budget in
1991. Failure to reach the shortfall goals triggers automatic
spending cuts on most federal programs.
   Congress and the White House initially lowered the deficit
somewhat, but haven't made steady progress. The law was eased in
1987 to stretch out the targets to 1993, but domestic spending has
grown and Presidents Reagan and Bush have blocked tax hikes and
sharp defense cuts.
   Critics charge that budget writers in the Capitol and the White
House have not really become adept at cutting the deficit, only at
finding loopholes around Gramm-Rudman and ignoring real deficit
reduction.
   ``A desirable change would be to put a dynamite charge under
Gramm-Rudman and blow it up,'' says Henry Aaron, senior fellow at
the Brookings Institution.
   But supporters say it has focused attention on the government's
red ink and helped force savings. One of the law's authors, Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says the legislation should be kept alive
until the budget is balanced.
   ``I didn't do all this flirting just to get down to the altar
and not get the `I do's' said,'' he said.

   A strong earthquake rolled through the South
Pacific off the Fiji islands late Saturday, seismologists reported.
There were no reports of damage or injuries.
   The quake struck at 9:27 p.m. (6:27 a.m. EST) and measured 7.5
on the Richter scale, according to reports from officials in Tokyo,
Hong Kong, and the National Earthquake Information Center in
Golden, Colo.
   An earthquake of 7.5 can cause major damage in populated areas,
but geophysicist John Minch at the information center in Colorado
said, ``We don't expect any damage. It's out there where there's
really nothing around.''
   He said it was centered in the ocean 300 miles southwest of
Nadi, in Fiji.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a

   President Bush and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu met today for the second day at their desert
summit to delve into divisive trade issues after an opening session
focused on the U.S. military presence in Asia.
   In three hours of talks today, the two were expected to tackle
thorny agenda items centering on growing U.S. unhappiness over the
$49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met for an hour earlier
today with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama.
   Bush greeted Kaifu at the Morningside Country Club saying, ``I
hope you got a little rest.''
   Kaifu told Bush through an interpreter, ``I had a very good
sleep.''
   Bush was joined at the conference table by Baker, national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and White House chief of staff John Sununu.
   The trade problems were touched on only briefly in Friday's
warm-up talks, with both sides noting that they face ``difficult
issues,'' said Shigeo Takenaka, deputy spokesman for the Japanese
foreign ministry.
   ``We didn't discuss things in specific terms,'' Kaifu told
reporters later, ``but there was a real sense of understanding. I
sensed no irritation whatsoever during our meeting.''
   On trade issues in general, Kaifu said, ``As you know there are
some things that can be moved along and others that are more
difficult.''
   He added that there are some structural areas where Japanese
action is ``absolutely necessary'' _ such as high land prices in
Japan _ ``but we must have the cooperation and understanding (of
the Japanese people) on these issues.''
   But Friday's talks principally focused on defense matters, U.S.
officials said. Bush and his wife, Barbara, later held a dinner for
Kaifu at the estate of publishing magnate Walter Annenberg.
   Bush told Kaifu that administration plans for a 10 percent
reduction in U.S. troop levels in Japan ``will not affect either
deterrence or stability, nor its commitment to its Asian allies,''
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement.
   The two also discussed the U.S. wish for Japan to increase its
$2.4 billion annual support for U.S. troops stationed there. They
both noted, Fitzwater said, ``the need for suitable arrangements
for balanced cost sharing.''
   Both Japanese and U.S. officials seemed eager to put a friendly
cast on the meeting as talks got under way.
   The president told reporters at a photo session that Kaifu's
two-day trip on a week's notice was ``quite a significant gesture
of friendship between our countries.''
   Takenaka told reporters that both leaders recognized the
importance of addressing trade issues seriously. To solve these
issues, he said, ``we must continue to strengthen cooperation in
other areas,'' such as aiding Latin American nations and the
emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   ``We certainly didn't sense any ambush here,'' he said when
asked if the Americans were coming down hard on Tokyo for trade
inequities.
   Bush is staying at the Annenberg home in this desert resort
before returning to Washington on Sunday.
   Kaifu arrived Friday afternoon, shortly after Bush flew in from
a series of appearances in the Los Angeles area.
   In their talks today at the Morningside Country Club, Bush
planned to put Kaifu on notice that Congress was in ``a very tough
mood'' about Japanese barriers to trade, Fitzwater said.
   U.S. officials also planned to pointedly note U.S. law that
calls for retaliatory moves that could double the cost of Japanese
goods sold in the United States if the United States finds Tokyo is
obstructing fair trade, Fitzwater said.
   Apparently attempting to signal good faith in advance of the
hastily called summit meeting, Kaifu announced before leaving Tokyo
that he was prepared to make concessions sought by the United
States.
   He outlined proposals that mirrored steps sought by the United
States to reform the Japanese economy and lifestyle in a way that
would encourage more purchase of U.S. imports.
   The trade tensions have been intensified by escalating Japanese
investment in America.
   The Bush-Kaifu meeting comes against a background of
congressionally set deadlines for talks on a dozen issues ranging
from supercomputers to lumber.
   In turn, Japan wants the United States to reduce its huge budget
deficit and increase Americans' savings rate, thus reducing demands
for Japanese imports.
   Last May, the United States cited Japan for alleged unfair
barriers against the sale of American wood products, satellites and
supercomputers. Under the 1988 U.S. trade law, if negotiations do
not produce removal of the barriers by June 16, the administration
can slap on severe retaliatory tariffs.
   A yearlong series of separate negotiations to resolve underlying
causes of the trade deficit, such as Japan's exclusionary business
practices and America's low savings rate have left U.S. negotiators
frustrated at the lack of movement.

   During last week's closed-door bargaining over
a Senate clean air bill, negotiators haggled over countless numbers
_ but the most important number was never mentioned.
   It was 60, the number of senators needed to make a compromise
clean air bill ``filibuster-proof'' and assure its Senate passage
in the months ahead. Through the 22 days of negotiations the number
hung over the meeting room like a blanket of smog.
   The agreement between Senate leaders and the Bush administration
over clean air legislation was a major victory for Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who instigated the closed-door
discussions in early February.
   He will bring the bill to the Senate floor for action on Monday,
but while there is expected to be lively debate and attempts to
make changes, the bill likely will not be altered significantly
   The secretive negotiations, criticized by environmentalists
publicly and some senators privately, were a masterful exhibition
of legislative maneuvering. And the principal goal, according to
various officials involved, was to produce a bill that would not
become the victim of regional interests on the Senate floor as
clean air legislation so often had in the past.
   For years Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., when he was majority
leader, blocked clean air bills regularly because controls on acid
rain would threaten thousands of jobs in the high-sulfur coal
mining areas of his state. Much of the Midwest and parts of the
South rely on high-sulfur coal to fuel electric power plants, the
source of most of the sulfur dioxide emissions that cause acid rain.
   A bloc of 14 senators, primarily from the Midwest and headed by
Byrd, had threatened to stall passage of legislation again, spurred
by word from utilities across the Midwest that the tougher
pollution controls would be far too costly for many of the plants
that dot the region.
   Meanwhile, there also were factions in the Senate worried about
other parts of the clean air bill as approved by the Environment
and Public Works Committee: Senators from the West and parts of the
South were worried that the pollution controls would inhibit future
growth; the auto industry lobbied the White House against the
bill's tough automobile emission controls, enlisting Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich., to argue their case in the closed-door
negotiations; and manufacturers buttonholed anyone they could to
tell them of the high cost of proposed controls on toxic chemical
releases.
   The dilemma facing Mitchell was how to eliminate enough of the
concerns in the bill to forge an alliance strong enough to overcome
whatever opposition remains. For that he needed the support of the
White House.
   So the private negotiations began.
   The provision on controlling toxic chemicals was weakened and
small businesses and industrial sources were exempted from
smog-causing pollution controls. The Bush administration was now
ready to accept both of those parts of the bill.
   The battle then turned to dealing with the chief objections of
the auto industry.
   A provision that would have required automakers to increase the
fuel efficiency of their cars was jettisoned early. But agreement
on auto emission controls, which were targeted by the
administration as too expensive, proved to be more difficult.
   Mitchell, trying to get the talks moving, set a deadline, saying
if no agreement could be reached he'd take the legislation to the
floor anyway. But the administration held some important cards as
well: Without the support of the president, Mitchell might not have
the votes to overcome a Midwest filibuster.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu sent that message when,
after meeting with Mitchell, he suggested a rush to push the bill
to the floor without agreement on automobile emission controls
could be ``undermining ... the acid rain section.''
   So after several days of marathon meetings that lasted past
midnight, an accord was reached on the automobile issues: a second
round of controls were significantly weakened so that they may
never go into effect.
   Mitchell's strategy was about to bear results.
   The legislation now had the support of President Bush, who in
turn could be counted on to produce enough Republican votes that a
filibuster likely would be overridden _ no matter what the Midwest
senators did.
   But there were still some loose ends.
   The concerns of the senators from the West and parts of the
South over the impact of the acid rain controls on future growth
had to be dealt with, for if they allied themselves with the
Midwest in _ for different reasons _ opposing the bill, its chances
were slim.
   A provision was crafted to deal with the problem by giving
so-called clean states additional pollution allowances to better
handle future growth. That brought another bloc of senators into
line.
   As the discussions on acid rain began, the senators from the
Midwest and Byrd from West Virginia were now alone and outgunned.
   ``We did not have a choice between the good, the bad and the
ugly. We had a choice between ugly, uglier and ugliest,'' said Sen.
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., recalling his travail during the private
negotiations on acid rain.
   When the compromise agreement was announced, Byrd said he would
continue to seek some changes on the Senate floor, but rejected the
possibility of a filibuster.
   ``We all have to be reasonable men and women,'' he explained.
   Mitchell's strategy had worked.

<TEXT>
   California's attorney general has sued
Farmers Insurance Group, claiming the state's second-largest
insurance company has defied Proposition 103, the voter-approved
insurance reform law.
   ``Farmers has attempted to make a mockery of the law either by
shunting some good driver applicants into a subsidiary called
Mid-Century, which does offer new policies but only at outrageous
prices, or by outright refusal to insure them at all,'' Attorney
General John Van de Kamp said at a news conference Friday.
   The lawsuit was filed the same day six other companies were
ordered by Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie to issue good
driver discount policies as mandated by Proposition 103.
   Notices of the Insurance Commission's findings were sent to
Allstate Insurance Co., Chicago Insurance Co. and Interstate
Indemnity, California Casualty Insurance Co., Cal-American
Insurance Co., and Clarendon National Insurance Co.
   Proposition 103, approved by voters in 1988, requires auto
insurance rates based primarily on a driver's safety record,
experience and miles driven. Drivers with no more than one moving
violation in three years are to be guaranteed lower rates.
   Van de Kamp's lawsuit, filed in Superior Court, seeks a
preliminary injunction to force Farmers to comply with a good
driver provision in Proposition 103 that states such drivers can
get 20 percent discounts.
   Van de Kamp, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, said he also
is seeking $2,500 in fines for each good driver refused insurance
policies at the discount rate.
   A spokesman for the Los Angeles-based insurance company said
Farmers has been wrongly accused.
   ``Farmers is absolutely complying with the good driver discount
and filed documents with the commissioner's office a couple of
weeks ago showing its whole marketing plan for marketing good
driver discounts,'' said attorney Leonard Venger, who represents
the company on Proposition 103 matters.

six days in a makeshift shelter with nothing to eat but snow and
chewing gum, police said.
   Hospital officials said Marie-Antoinette Meynet, 31, would lose
a toe to frostbite and that her companion, 34-year-old Philippe
Bensimon, was in ``very serious condition'' with both feet badly
frostbitten.
   The search for the couple was delayed for several days by
snowstorms in a wooded valley near Chamonix in the French Alps, 380
miles southeast of Paris.
   When the weather cleared Saturday, searchers in a helicopter
found Bensimon unconscious outside the shelter, which was built
with their skis, blocks of snow and pine branches. He and Miss
Meynet, described as semiconscious at the time of the rescue, were
taken by helicopter to the Chamonix hospital.

   Thousands of Israeli Arabs have signed a
petition urging the Soviet Union to stop Jewish immigration to
Israel for fear the new arrivals will take away Arab jobs,
organizers of the campaign said Saturday.
   The petition drive is a sign of the growing alienation of
Israel's 800,000 Arab citizens.
   Yossi Olmert, head of the Government Press Office, called the
petition drive a grave development that ``undermines the very
foundations of the state.''
   One of Israel's self-declared reasons for existence is the
ingathering of exiles.
   ``Arabs who are citizens are protesting the immigration of Jews
into Israel, and this must be seen as being orchestrated by the PLO
as part of the worldwide campaign against immigration,'' Olmert
said.
   The petition urges Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to stop
the exodus of Soviet Jews, which is due in part to relaxed Soviet
emigration rules and in part to fears of anti-Semitism in the
Soviet Union.
   Israeli leaders have said they expect up to 750,000 Soviet Jews
to immigrate this decade, and one government official said last
week he expected as many as 230,000 to arrive this year.
   ``The Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union is at the expense
of the Palestinian people. This immigration will escalate the
racial discrimination that Arabs suffer,'' said the petition, which
was written by Arab nationalist activists calling themselves ``The
Sons of the Village.''
   On Saturday, about 1,000 people signed the petition in the
northern Israeli town of Nazareth, bringing the total in the past
two days to more than 4,000 signatures, said organizer Mohammed
Kayal, an Arab journalist. He said the drive would continue for
another two weeks and that the petition would then be sent to
Gorbachev.
   ``The Israeli Arabs are really worried,'' said Atallah Mansour,
another Israeli Arab journalist. ``The Israeli government policy
for the past 40 years has been not to treat the Arab population on
egalitarian terms, and now the Arabs again have someone coming
before them in the queue.''
   The main concern is that that Soviet Jewish immigrants will take
away jobs from Arabs who face an unemployment rate of more than 15
percent, compared to about 10 percent among Israeli Jews.
   ``For the unemployed and the young university graduates, this is
a terrifying nightmare,'' Mansour said.
   Israeli Arabs frequently complain about being treated as
second-class citizens. For example, they are barred from serving in
the army, and are thus not eligible for many benefits given
veterans, such as low-interest loans on housing.
   The concern over the influx of Soviet Jews has been complicated
by fears that some might settle in the occupied West Bank or Gaza
Strip, where Palestinians are fighting for their own state.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested Thursday that
$400 million in loan guarantees to help build housing for the
emigrants be linked to Israeli promises that no new settlements
will be built in the occupied lands.
   Israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the
occupied territories, and government leaders denounced Baker's
proposal Friday. They said that of 12,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants
last year, only about 200 settled in the occupied territories.
   Also Saturday, 33-year-old Sadi Abdel Fatah from Gaza's Bureij
refugee camp died at a hospital after being stabbed and shot in the
head by masked Palestinians who suspected him of being an informer,
an Arab reporter said.
   The death brought to 191 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the uprising against Israeli rule, which began
in December 1987. Another 659 Palestinians have been killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians. Forty-three Israelis have died in
the violence.
   In clashes in Gaza City, troops wounded four Palestinians,
including an 18-year-old who was in critical condition with a
bullet in the abdomen, Ahli Arab Hospital officials said.
   An army official confirmed one wounded and said he was checking
the reports of the death in Bureij and the other casualties.

<HEAD>U.S. Broadcasts to Cuba Gear Up For Mid-March Start</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Destabilizing Castro's Cuba isn't the objective for
broadcasting U.S. television to Havana, says the chief of the new
TV Marti.
   But if that's that result, so be it.
   ``If that's subversive,'' said Antonio Navarro of TV Marti's aim
to provide objective and balanced news, ``then maybe it is. ... But
that's not the intent.''
   The potential impact of the U.S.-sponsored TV Marti has taken on
added significance with the defeat of Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinistas, a longtime ally of Cuba's Communist regime. Cuban
exiles in Miami view the defeat as a precursor to Fidel Castro's
fall.
   The Cuban government, for its part, says the planned broadcasts
are an act of aggression and an attempt to ``subvert the order in
Cuba.'' The Caribbean island nation, 90 miles from the Florida
Keys, is preparing to jam the broadcasts and take retaliatory
measures.
   The United States has been broadcasting radio transmissions to
Cuba via Radio Marti _ named for Cuban patriot Jose Marti _ for
about five years. Last year, Congress provided $16 million for
television broadcasts to Cuba.
   TV Marti's testing start-up has been scheduled for mid-March.
Whether or not it moves into full operation, the prospect of U.S.
broadcasts has already further strained relations between
Washington and Havana.
   Daily broadcasts of several hours of entertainment and sports
programming are planned for the 90-day test period, said Michael
Schoenfeld, spokesman for Voice of America, which will produce the
shows.
   The broadcasts beamed to Havana are expected to have a potential
viewing audience of some 2.5 million people, according to
Schoenfeld. Radio Marti is heard by more than 85 percent of the
Cuban population, he said.
   Jorge Mas Canosa, chairman of the Cuban American National
Foundation, an anti-Castro group that lobbied for TV Marti in
Congress, says the TV broadcasts will have an even greater impact
on Cubans than Radio Marti.
   ``TV is a much more powerful means than radio,'' Mas said
recently. ``It has much more impact on the public opinion.''
   Proponents of TV Marti say it will provide an alternative to the
government-controlled media in Cuba _ one that could prove even
more damaging to Castro than news of upheaval in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union via Radio Marti.
   ``I believe that it's going to be a big help in this moment when
we know the regime is falling down. ... They'll see how the rest of
the world is,'' said Ceferino Perez of the Cuban Municipalities in
Exile, a Miami group whose members are preparing to assist their
countrymen in rebuilding Cuba in the event Castro is toppled.
   But there has been criticism of TV Marti, not the least from the
Cuban government, which has vehemently protested the transmissions
are a violation of sovereignty and international broadcasting
agreements.
   Besides, said Ariel Ricardo, press officer of the Cuban
Interests Section, in Washington, ``It's no secret to the Cuban
people what's going on in the world.'' Cubans are ``quite well
informed'' through the Cuban media and other sources such as the
British Broadcasting Corp. and Miami radio stations whose powerful
signals reach the island.
   And, Ricardo said, just because the Cuban government has
tolerated Radio Marti, which it also opposes, ``doesn't mean we
consider Radio Marti right.''
   U.S. broadcasters, especially in Florida, are worried about
retaliatory broadcasts from Cuba or direct interference from TV
Marti's signal. Schoenfeld says TV Marti's specially designed,
highly directional antenna will virtually eliminate interference to
domestic broadcasters.
   Spanish-language programs from Washington will be relayed to a
transmitter aboard a giant balloon tethered over Cudjoe Key and
then beamed to Havana.
   Sydney Head, a expert on international broadcasting and author
of ``World Broadcast,'' criticized TV Marti, calling it ``a
tremendous boondoggle.''
   ``There's no purpose in it except to satisfy the zeal of Cuban
ex-patriots,'' Head said recently in a telephone interview from
Oceano, Calif. ``They'll do anything to tweak (Castro's) nose, make
him uncomfortable.''
   Head said TV Marti is certain to capture a sizable audience
simply because of the entertainment value of U.S. programs compared
with what Cuba has to offer. But he doesn't think it will have much
of an effect on public opinion.

   Goodbye to the shepherds and milkmaids enshrined
in English lore, and welcome herdspersons of the 1990s.
   The drive for sexual equality and professional standards has
reached men and women who look after cows, pigs, goats, deer,
sheep, chickens, and even llamas.
   The Professional Herdspersons Society, launched Friday at the
Palace of Westminster, hopes to attract 10,000 members in its first
year.
   Sir Richard Body, a Conservative Party lawmaker, former chairman
of the House of Commons Select Committee on Agriculture and onetime
pig breeder, said the society's aim is to put men and women who
manage animals ``on the pedestal where they belong.''
   ``They do a marvelous job in all sorts of weather, seven days a
week, and their role must be more professionally recognized,'' he
said.
   The society plans to set standards of care for various animals
and provide a monthly journal, life and accident insurance, and
medical coverage.
   Body, who will be an adviser to the society, said: ``My only
worry is the word herdsperson.''
   At the opening session, several officials of the new society
slipped up at times, referring to the ``men'' and the ``chaps'' on
livestock farms.

   Paul McCartney returned to Japan's stage Saturday
after a 24-year absence with a smoky, laser-studded show peppered
with old Beatles hits.
   ``It's great to be back,'' McCartney told 60,000 fans at the
Tokyo Dome, an indoor baseball stadium where McCartney will perform
his six Japan concerts.
   It was a rousing comeback to Japan for the 47-year-old
McCartney. The last time he tried to tour Japan he was arrested
before even leaving the airport after customs officials found 219
grams of marijuana among his belongings.
   The ex-Beatle was held for 10 days before he was expelled and
banned from ever returning. But based on his clean record for the
past five years, he was granted special permission by the Justice
Ministry to perform.
   McCartney said at a news conference Thursday he now would tell
people ``be straight and stay natural and don't use any drugs or
stimulants or booze.''
   After playing ``Band on the Run'' from his days with his old
band Wings, McCartney told the crowd he would take them ``to a very
faraway place called the 60s,'' and whipped off ``The Long and
Winding Road,'' ``Can't Buy Me Love'' and ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band.''
   McCartney's world tour started in Oslo, Norway, last September
and has taken him through Britain, continental Europe and the
United States. From Japan, the band travels to Australia, back to
the United States, to Brazil and finishes in Europe in April.

   Conway Twitty is picky when it comes to
selecting songs for his country music albums. He says he reviews up
to 3,000 songs before he chooses 10.
   ``We go through this town with a seine, or a sifter,'' he said
Friday at the annual Country Radio Seminar. ``We go through 2,500
to 3,000 songs before I pick the 10 that I do. There's nothing more
important than that song.''
   Twitty said a career ``starts with great songs and ends with bad
songs. So always do great songs and you'll stay in this business a
long time.''
   The seminar is for employees at country music radio stations.
   Twitty is a veteran country music performer known for his hit
records ``It's Only Make Believe'' and ``Linda on My Mind.''

   The recipe was part of a Sumerian hymn to
the goddess Ninkasi, written in cuneiform on a clay tablet that
dates back to 1800 B.C. It calls for ingredients you might not
think of, but it makes a smooth, mild beer _with a little fruity
taste.
   ``It's very good,'' Professor Solomon Katz of the University of
Pennsylvania said as he opened a bottle. ``They used dates to make
it taste that way.''
   The bottle's label had cuneiform characters calling Ninkasi, the
goddess of beer, ``the lady who fills the vessel with beer.'' The
label also showed one of the earliest known tablets, showing two
men using straws to sip beer from a narrow-necked jar.
   The beer was the culmination of two years of research by Katz
and Fritz Maytag, owner of San Francisco-based Anchor Brewing Co.
   They sampled some of the last bottles of the beer last week in
Philadelphia. They had brewed about 100 barrels in August, but said
they were forced to use it up quickly since it contained no
preservatives.
   ``The Sumerians didn't use hops, which help to keep beer from
going sour,'' Maytag said in a telephone interview from San
Francisco.
   Modern beer makers usually use malted, or sprouted, grain, but
the Sumerians used baked bread, which adds to the mild taste, Katz
said.
   ``They did that because the bread was almost magical to them,''
Katz said. ``You could eat it for dinner or you could brew with
it.''
   The cuneiform tablet, originally translated in 1964, records a
brewing process interspersed with praises to the goddess.
   ``You are the one who soaks the malt in a jar, the waves rise,
the waves fall,'' starts one verse.
   ``That's a brewing process,'' Katz said. ``That's exactly what
brewers do today to turn the grains into malt.''
   ``Real brewing is very simple,'' Maytag said. ``And we know that
the brewers 5,000 years ago were extremely skilled. We ought to
assume that these guys were just as good at brewing as we are.''
   By the time the Ninkasi hymn was written, brewing was at least
5,000 years old, said Katz. By 2000 B.C., Sumerian had 55 words
describing different varieties of beer.
   ``Beer recipes are the oldest we have,'' Katz said.
   Katz, an anthropologist specializing in nutrition, believes beer
may be the cornerstone of civilization and has argued that ancient
man turned from hunting to farming to raise grain for beer.
   Barley and wheat _ the two main ingredients of ancient beer _
were among the first grains man began to harvest.
   ``Why did people go out and domesticate a cereal grain that
doesn't have much nutrition?'' Katz asked. ``They had plenty of
other resources ... why would they go through the effort? Could it
be because it was a source of fermented sugar?''
   A 1987 newspaper story about Katz's theories, which the
professor also had written about, caught Maytag's eye and led to
the collaboration.
   ``I thought it was intriguing,'' Maytag said. ``It occurred to
me we should try to make some of the beer, to see what we could
learn.''
   Katz had to pore over many tablets to determine some of the
finer points of the recipe.
   He pointed at the translation of the Ninkasi hymn.
   ``See where it says, `Mixing ... with sweet aromatics?' We can't
be sure if that meant grapes, raisins or dates,'' he said. They
narrowed it down to dates using other recipe tablets from that time
period.
   Maytag has no plans to market Ninkasi, although people have
tried to buy it: ``I don't think the world is ready to buy Sumerian
beer.''

<HEAD>Angola Claims New Attack on Rebel Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Angolan government said air force
planes bombed the headquarters of U.S.-backed UNITA rebels for the
second time in a week.
   State television interrupted programing to broadcast a Defense
Ministry statement saying two planes attacked the guerrillas' bush
stronghold at Jamba on Friday in retaliation for UNITA raids on
economic and civilian targets.
   Last week, the government claimed two fighter planes breached
sophisticated, U.S.-supplied anti-aircraft defenses to bomb the
rebel headquarters at Jamba, 850 miles southeast of Luanda.
   In Lisbon, Portugal, spokesmen for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, known as UNITA, denied the government
claims.
   UNITA's Lisbon representative Alcides Sakala said the
government's Soviet-built planes instead bombed the area of
Mavinga, some 160 miles north of Jamba to support a ground
offensive launched in late December.
   He insisted Jamba was not hit.
   There was no independent confirmation of either report.
   According to the ministry statement, Friday's raid was in
response to rebel attacks that left 26 civilians dead and destroyed
a bridge in northern Uige and Malanje provinces.
   Government officials also said a UNITA attack on power lines
Thursday cut electricity to the central port of Benguela for 36
hours. Rebels cut water and electricity in Luanda twice last month.
   UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi urged his forces to intensify attacks
on economic targets around the country following the government
offensive at Mavinga.
   Fighting has flared in recent weeks as government and rebel
troops battle for control of the strategic airstrip and rebel base
near Mavinga.
   The battle, said to be the heaviest in the 15-year conflict, has
darkened hopes of getting government and rebel representatives back
to the negotiating table.
   UNITA has been fighting to force the government to share power
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in
1975.
   The rebels want free elections, established by a transitional
government, as a condition for peace. The government has offered
terms based on an amnesty and integration of the rebels into
Angolan society.

   Iranian security forces used helicopter
gunships Saturday to battle drug smugglers in southwest Iran,
killing an undisclosed number of them, Tehran radio reported
Saturday.
   The smugglers were traveling in a caravan when they were
ambushed by the security forces in Kerman province on Friday, said
the report. It said all the dealers were killed, but gave no number
or other details.
   The battle occurred during a weeklong, nationwide assault on the
drug trade in which security forces killed 10 other drug smugglers,
arrested 750 and rounded up 6,550 addicts, said the report,
monitored in Nicosia.
   The broadcast said 6,300 pounds of drugs were seized in the
crackdown, part of an anti-narcotics campaign launched in December
1988.
   The radio gave no details of the week's clashes. But the
official media have frequently reported gunbattles between security
forces and drugs gangs.
   A year-old, anti-narcotics law requires the death penalty for
anyone caught with even small quantities of drugs with intent to
sell.
   The state-run radio says more than 1,200 convicted drug
smugglers have been hanged since the campaign was launched in
response to a public outcry over Iran's mushrooming drug problem.
More than 50,000 addicts have been sent to hard-labor camps or are
in prison, according to official reports.

   The government rushed more troops to
Kashmir valley Saturday to halt a Moslem rebellion, but
curfew-defying protests continued and one person was killed by
security forces, witnesses and officials said.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
paramilitary troops raided six hideouts used by militants demanding
independence for the Moslem-dominated region.
   ``It was part of an ongoing process to break the back of the
terrorists,'' said the officials, refusing to give details of the
raids' outcome.
   State-run television said Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir
dismissed 16 government employees for alleged involvement in
``militant and subversive activities.''
   The television report did not give the employees' designations
or identify their departments.
   Witnesses and airport sources said about 900 paramilitary police
and border guards had arrived in Kashmir by aircraft and that
hundreds of soldiers came by trucks Saturday. More were expected,
they said.
   The security forces were sent to enforce an indefinite curfew
clamped in Kashmir valley early Friday after at least 49 people
were shot to death by army and paramilitary troops.
   The government, in keeping with regulations, refused to say how
many troops and paramilitary police were deployed in the valley,
but military sources put the number at around 25,000.
   Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state, is at the
center of the Moslem secessionist movement.
   Witnesses said one person was killed in the city Saturday when
troops opened fire on a group of people who defied curfew and came
out of their homes. The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A few other incidents of curfew violation were reported from
other parts of the city, and militants and paramilitary troops
exchanged fire downtown, the witnesses said. They said there were
no casualties.
   The state government's information department has been closed
since Friday. Its offices were locked Saturday and telephone calls
went unanswered.
   Local journalists said the government asked reporters of
non-Kashmiri newspapers and those of two national news agencies to
leave Srinagar.
   ``They were advised that they could become the targets of the
militants. Many have already left,'' a Kashmiri reporter said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At least 163 people have been killed in Kashmir since the latest
round of violence flared Jan. 20 following a government crackdown
on the escalating protests, bombings and attacks on state officials.
   The secessionist campaign has been alternately simmering and
flaring for more than 40 years.
   Jammu-Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan after the
British colonial India was partitioned on gaining independence in
1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part
of Indian Kashmir.
   Sixty-four percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslems,
but nationwide, Moslems make up just 12 percent of India's 880
million people.
   The militants had earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan,
which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem population.
Now they demand independence and the status of a neutral country.

   President Bush's nominee for the nation's top
civil rights enforcement job holds nearly $20,000 worth of stock in
a company that does business in white-ruled South Africa.
   Former New York state Sen. John R. Dunne has 400 shares of
Schlumberger Ltd., with a market value of $19,650, according to the
financial disclosure form he has submitted to the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   Schlumberger, a New York-based firm engaged in oil field
services and oil products manufacturing, has direct investments in
South Africa, according to Alison Cooper, a spokeswoman for
Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based
advocacy group that tracks such companies.
   Schlumberger's South African business accounted for less than 1
percent of its total sales of about $5 billion last year, said
company spokesman Seth McCormick. Schlumberger has between 40 and
50 employees in that country, he said.
   Dunne, who faces a Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday,
declined to comment on the South African investments and said he
didn't know that Schlumberger did business in the white-ruled
country.
   ``I don't really pay any attention to this,'' he said in a
telephone interview Friday from New York. ``My brother handles my
small account.''
   International trade sanctions applied to South Africa to protest
its apartheid policy of racial separation could cost that country's
economy as much as $2 billion a year, according to Stephen R. Lewis
Jr., president of Carlton College in Northfield, Minn., and author
of ``The Economics of Apartheid.'' Fewer than 1 percent of all
South Africans are employed by American companies.
   American companies doing business in South Africa currently
number about 120, according to Steven Davis, a senior analyst at
the Investor Responsibility Research Center. He said the total was
down from a high of about 300 before the United States applied a
bar on new investment and other sanctions in 1986.
   Dunne reported securities investments of $179,120 in a variety
of companies, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Texas Instruments and
several other technology firms. Cooper said none of the other
companies did business in South Africa, although several have
``non-equity ties,'' meaning they have licensing, distribution or
trade agreements in that country.
   Asked why he would not discuss his views on investing in South
Africa, Dunne said: ``It seems to me it's the Senate's prerogative
to have the first shot at me on these issues. It's not something
I've discussed before and if they raise it, I will respond to their
concerns.''
   Meanwhile, civil rights groups have said little about Dunne's
nomination as assistant attorney general for civil rights
enforcement, although he has had little experience in that area.
   ``We're not opposing him,'' said Art Kropp, president of People
for the American Way, a Washington liberal group. ``I think we
agree the consensus is this is as good as we're going to get.''
   ``He is, at bottom, a man without a record'' on civil rights,
said Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund, a gay rights advocacy group. ``It's
hard to comment on nothing.''
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
had no position on Dunne, according to spokesman Jim Williams.
``We're still looking at the record,'' he said.
   Civil rights groups protested vigorously against Bush's first
choice for the job, William Lucas, a former Wayne County, Mich.,
sheriff who also had next to no civil rights experience. Lucas was
opposed by the NAACP, People for the American Way, the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, among
others.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee killed Lucas' nomination.
   Dunne, a Republican, spent 24 years in the New York Senate,
where his major achievements included helping to rewrite state
insurance laws and revamp the penal system after the deadly 1971
riot at Attica state prison.
   Dunne has voted for the Equal Rights Amendment and against
busing to achieve school integration. He has supported the death
penalty but also sponsored one of the first laws to protect the
confidentiality of people who test positive for the AIDS virus.
   The New York Civil Liberties Union gave him low ratings every
year for most of his career, including a zero in 1989. Dunne quit
the Senate last year after losing the race for majority leader.
   Dunne also formerly belonged to clubs that did not allow women
members but has since resigned.

Reforms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Joan Claybrook is banking on the story of
Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan to persuade voters to
demand changes in the way congressional elections are financed.
   Public Citizen, the organization Claybrook leads, is among a
number of self-styled public interest groups pushing Congress to
accept public financing of the campaigns, with spending limits and
significant restrictions on political action committee donations.
   A new poll conducted for Public Citizen shows a clear majority
of the public, 58 percent, supports the concept of public financing
_ the highest level since just after the Watergate scandal.
   But the poll also found most voters know very little about the
mechanics of public financing and are skeptical that any financing
system would remove the influence of political action committees
formed by special interests.
   That is where Claybrook hopes the story of Keating and the
widespread problems in the savings and loan industry will help.
   The collapse of Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan will cost
taxpayers $2 billion. And Claybrook estimates that the $150 billion
federal bailout of the S&amp;L industry overall is costing each
taxpayer about $1,000.
   The poll found overwhelming anger among voters who were told
about five senators who intervened on Keating's behalf with federal
regulators who were considering seizing Lincoln because of
questionable lending and investments.
   Keating and associates previously had donated $600,000 to the
campaigns of causes of the five senators.
   That anger, according to the pollsters, could provide Public
Citizen and its allies with the opening they have always needed to
persuade the public that the campaign financing system should be
overhauled.
   ``The scandals surrounding the savings and loan industry, in
particular, have created a political moment where voters are able
to make the conceptual link between campaign money and their own
interests and quality of representation,'' the analysis from the
pollsters said.
   The pollsters cautioned, however, that while people are unhappy
with the current campaign finance system and increasingly skeptical
of Congress, they will be difficult to mobilize.
   ``The public, though increasingly unhappy with the current
system, examines the issue through its larger political lenses,
which do not focus easily on campaign finance as a political
issue,'' the analysis said.
   Public Citizen and its allies have little time to redirect the
focus.
   Congressional leaders have promised to bring campaign finance
legislation to the floor this spring. But no bipartisan agreement
is in sight and both Democrats and Republicans bickering among
themselves.
   Lobbyists for Public Citizen, Common Cause and other groups are
increasingly skeptical that their proposals will be enacted.
   The groups are hoping that a groundswell of public support will
improve their chances, and the Public Citizen poll contained
evidence to convince them that a well orchestrated campaign could
attract supporters.
   Most encouraging to the groups was poll data showing that 58
percent of respondents favor the concept of public financing, the
highest level of support since immediately after the Watergate
scandal.
   Seventy-four percent said the congressional campaign system
needs to be changed and 18 percent said ``the system is a mess and
needs to be fundamentally reformed.''
   Majorities supported several goals of the groups, including
limits on political action committee contributions, overall
campaign spending limits and a requirement that candidates raise
most of their money in their home district or state.
   Also drawing wide support were proposals to provide each
candidate with a fixed amount of television time and reduce mailing
rates in return for promises of limited spending.
   ``The public is saying that it wants Congress back,'' said
Claybrook.
   Yet the poll provided indications as well that there are tough
obstacles to rallying the public behind campaign finance reform.
   The nationwide poll of 1,100 probable voters last month found
campaign finance far from the top of the list of chief concerns.
Just 5 percent ranked it first, ahead of other issues such as drugs
and crime, the economy, taxes and the environment.
   The poll also found that support for public campaign financing _
the centerpiece of the changes sought by Public Citizen and its
allies _ withered when voters were reminded their tax dollars could
be used for negative ``attack ads'' or for support of extremist
candidates.
   The public interest groups are adopting a number of strategies
designed to convince voters that the faults of the current system
should outweigh their reservations about public financing.
   Common Cause, long a critic of the use of money from political
action committees, is getting personal, releasing detailed lists of
every PAC donation accepted by incumbent members of Congress over
the last decade.
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a longtime advocate of
clean air legislation, on Saturday released an analysis showing
that PACs tied to companies and unions opposing the legislation
have donated $27.4 million to Senate and House candidates in the
past decade.
   For its part, Public Citizen is combining its lobbying of
Congress with targeted field work, hoping to raise public awareness
of the issue in the districts of lawmakers who are seen as
impediments to reform.
   ``We've never failed to name names,'' said Claybrook.
   In the poll, 53 percent of respondents said they would vote for
a challenger who supported public financing if the incumbent voted
against it. The pollsters said that reaction was probably greatly
overstated but it still shows ``voters are in an anti-political
mood'' at least in part because they feel Congress is more
responsive to financial backers than constituents.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was a
trapped man. He was under pressure not only from the United States
but also Western Europe and even the Soviet Union. He was left with
one course: Hold a free election.
   That, in the most succinct terms, is the way American officials
described the plight in which Ortega found himself during the
months leading up to last Sunday's history-making election in
Nicaragua.
   For years Americans have been debating who lost China and who
lost Cuba. Now there's a new question: Who won Nicaragua?
   The debate has already started. Was the administration smart,
lucky or both? Did last Sunday's election vindicate or discredit
President Reagan's policy of military support for the Nicaraguan
Contras? Whatever the answers, seldom has any policy fallen into
place quite so neatly as the administration's approach to Nicaragua.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt a strong sense of
vindication last Monday when former President Jimmy Carter, in
Nicaragua as an election observer, telephoned him at 4:15 a.m. with
the surprise news: Violeta Chamorro had won in a landslide.
   For a decade, Nicaragua seemed like just another intractable
Third World dispute. It was one of those ``low intensity
conflicts'' which appeared to be beyond resolution, much like
Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia.
   When the Bush administration took office last January, it was
intent on shelving the previous policy of military support for the
Contra rebels. But what other options were there for taming the
Sandinistas?
   Less than a month after taking office, the admininistration saw
an opening when Ortega promised his Central American colleagues
that honest elections would be held in February 1990.
   The reaction among many conservatives here was deep skepticism
that Ortega would keep his word. But the administration decided to
cooperate with the process, switching its support from the
externally-based Contras to the internal opposition to Ortega in
Nicaragua.
   The administration also struck deal with the Congress that, in
effect, ended a decade of internal warfare here over Nicaragua.
   The deal, while ending military aid for the Contras, enabled
them to survive, through U.S. food donations, as a potential future
threat to the Sandinistas. Until elections were held, Washington
would withhold normal relations with the Sandinistas.
   As a show of support for democracy, the administration publicly
discouraged the rebels from engaging in armed attacks and urged the
Contra leadership to return home in peace. The U.S. Embassy in
Managua quietly counseled Mrs. Chamorro's coalition to guard
against splintering at all costs.
   Congress approved $9 million last fall to help Mrs. Chamorro's
campaign and to promote non-partisan activities such as poll
watching and voter registration.
   The United States and the Central Americans were not the only
ones pressuring Ortega. He went to an aid donors conference in
Sweden last April hoping to raise $250 million for Nicaragua's
devastated economy and reportedly came away with only $20 million.
   The Europeans agreed with the United States that aid should be
withheld until after a free election.
   As outlined by U.S. officials, the Soviet Union, the
Sandinistas' chief military backer, also played a constructive
role. As an example, under Soviet pressure, the Sandinistas
promised opposition candidates last summer they would be allowed to
campaign freely.
   Three weeks ago, a Soviet-American statement pledged mutual
respect for the results of free and fair elections in Nicaragua.
   ``All of these elements combined,'' a senior administration
official said last week, ``helped create an environment in which
free and fair elections were the only opportunity for the
Sandinista government to normalize relations with the rest of Latin
America and with the United States and to obtain legitimacy and
economic aid.''
   But how would Nicaraguans vote? Most of the pre-election signs
pointed to an Ortega landslide and Ortega himself thought he was a
shoo-in.
   A Sandinista victory was suggested by public opinion polls in
Nicaragua. Most of the 55 State Department officials who took part
in a $2 office pool predicted a Sandinista victory.
   But the handful of officials who deal with Nicaragua daily,
sensing the polls were unreliable, all predicted a Chamorro
victory. Indeed, the Nicaragua desk officer, Craig Kelly, foresaw a
55 per cent to 41 per cent win for Chamorro, her precise margin of
victory.

   Democrat Walter Fauntroy announced Saturday he
will run for mayor of the nation's capital, saying he hoped to
``heal the hurt'' left by incumbent Marion Barry's indictment on
drug and perjury charges.
   Fauntroy, the city's non-voting delegate to Congress since 1971,
said he reached his decision to seek the Democratic nomination
``after weeks of painful and tearful consideration.''
   ``I just might be able to attract and unleash the unprecedented
partnership of talented people required to heal the hurt and end
the polarization in our city,'' Fauntroy told a prayer breakfast.
   Fauntroy, 57, was an aide to civil rights leader Martin Luther
King Jr. in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in the
1960s. He is an ordained Baptist minister.
   In Congress, he has pushed statehood for the District of
Columbia and is the No.2 Democrat on the House Banking Committee.
As a delegate, he cannot vote on the floor but may vote in
committee.
   Fauntroy joins a crowded field in the Democratic primary, where
the political picture was turned into turmoil by Barry's drug
arrest. Victory in the Democratic primary has long been tantamount
to election in Washington.
   Barry, who is being treated for substance abuse at a South
Carolina hospital, has not announced his political plans. But a
recent Washington Post poll show the mayor would still lead a field
of the other candidates.
   Barry was arrested Jan. 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine possession
charge. He was indicted last month on cocaine possession and
perjury charges in connection with an investigation into his ties
to a convicted drug dealer.
   The Justice Department has been investigating allegations that
Fauntroy had a ``no-show'' employee on his payroll. Fauntroy's
advisers told potential supporters last week that the Justice
Department probe has been scuttled.
   But a law enforcement source, speaking only on condition of
anonymity, said the probe has not been abandoned.

   According to the television report, Shamir agreed to a formula
that states the proposed Palestinian delegation could include
Palestinians who have been registered in a census as residents of
the occupied territories. However, this could include Palestinians
who have been deported, or who live in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Once Shamir publicly states his acceptance of the formula, Baker
will convene a meeting in Washington with the foreign ministers of
Israel and Egypt, the report said.
   ``During this meeting, they will discuss names of Palestinian
delegates,'' it said. Shamir will be able to reject individual
names, according to the report.
   The report did not mention the issue of the agenda for the

   Warning: this story may contain explicit
descriptions of legislation designed to brand recordings with
sexually graphic or violent lyrics.
   Pennsylvania's record-labeling bill, pending in the state
Senate, has whipped up a coast-to-coast controversy pitting fearful
parents and conservatives against panicky record producers,
retailers and musicians.
   Supporters of the bill, citing tunes such as ``Me So Horny'' and
``Necrophiliac,'' say they are determined to save children from
ruining their lives by monitoring their buying and listening
habits. They cite cases of teen-agers who they say have committed
murder or suicide before, during or after listening to
objectionable songs.
   Opponents charge the measure would be an invasion of their
constitutional rights. They say the labels would be unnecessary and
would inhibit creativity.
   State Rep. Ron Gamble, the measure's sponsor, has touted it on
``Entertainment Tonight,'' National Public Radio's ``Morning
Edition'' and in newspapers nationwide.
   ``I didn't dream there would be such interest in the bill, it
wasn't like I had a big news conference. I just introduced it and
that was it,'' he said. ``But it seems to have caught on ... we've
had calls from California to Florida to Detroit.''
   Under the measure, which has passed the state House and is now
pending in the Senate, every record, tape or compact disc sold in
Pennsylvania containing obscene lyrics would have to bear a
fluorescent warning label. About a dozen states are considering
similar bills.
   The label would say: ``Warning: may contain explicit lyrics
descriptive of or advocating one or more of the following: suicide,
sodomy, incest, bestiality, sadomasochism, adultery, sexual
activity in a violent context, murder, morbid violence or use of
illegal drugs or alcohol.''
   ``It's a truth in labeling bill, just like when you buy a can of
vegetables, they tell you everything that's in there. With
cigarettes, too, there are labels that tell you what the
ramifications are,'' said Peg Luksik, president of Pennsylvania
Parents Commission, one of the groups lobbying for the measure. She
said the group has 15,000 to 20,000 members.
   A voluntary agreement to label records has not worked and it's
up to the government to act, said Michael Geer, president of the
Pennsylvania Family Institute.
   Representatives of the recording industry, retailers,
merchandisers and civil rights groups have vowed to fight the
measure all the way to the courts.
   ``While I understand the concerns of the supporters of this
amendment, legislation is not the answer,'' said a letter to
senators from Jason S. Berman, president of the Recording Industry
Association of America Inc.
   ``As a father of three teen-age daughters, I believe I, not
record-store owners or government, should be the judge of what is
suitable music for the home. If I am not concerned with my
children's well-being, no label will make a difference.''
   Tanya Blackwood of the association said the burden of the law
will fall on record-store owners.
   ``It will make the retailer double-check everything that comes
in the store and will force him to err on the conservative side
rather than take a chance,'' Ms. Blackwood said. ``Retail stores
will stop carrying products.''
   Frank Adams of Specialty Records Corp. in Olyphant, said the
measure would wreak havoc on his business, possibly leading to
layoffs among his 2,000 employees. Specialty makes records, tapes
and compact discs for several record labels.
   ``It could force some of the labels to have their products made
somewhere else,'' Adams said.
   Stephen MacNett, aide to Senate Republicans, said the bill was
put aside for recent automobile-insurance reform debate.
   ``There's no plans to put it on the schedule immediately,''
MacNett said.
   As to its chance for passage, MacNett said, ``I wouldn't rule it
out.''
   Vincent Carocci, spokesman for Gov. Robert P. Casey, said the
governor is aware of the bill, but would not take a position until
it crosses his desk.

   Two Americans jailed in Iran for several
years could be freed if Washington agreed to release three American
Moslems imprisoned in the United States, a Tehran newspaper
suggested Saturday.
   The English-language daily Kayhan International said the release
could come after the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon as
a step toward ``improved ties'' between Washington and Tehran in
the ``post-hostage era.''
   The newspaper's mention of a ``post-hostage'' era was the latest
in a series of recent indications from Iran and allied Shiite
Moslem militants in Lebanon that Western captives held in Lebanon
could be released.
   There are 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon, most of whom are
believed held by pro-Iranian factions. They are eight Americans,
four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an
Italian.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnapped in
Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Iranian officials and newspapers, as well as a Shiite leader in
Lebanon, have over the past two weeks made statements urging the
hostages be released.
   But, despite the optimism this has raised in some quarters that
a release is possible, the hostages appear to be caught in the
cross fire between Iran's so-called pragmatists led by President
Hashemi Rafsanjani and hard-line, anti-Western radicals led by
former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   This is mirrored in the Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah, or
Party of God, which is believed to be the parent group for the
hostage-holding factions.
   Hezbollah's political wing supports Rafsanjani, who is seeking
to improve ties with the West. But the militants holding the
captives are aligned with Mohtashemi.
   Nonetheless, Kayhan International's comments underlined that
Tehran may be seeking new openings for dialogue with the West,
particularly the United States.
   The newspaper said the two American prisoners, David Erwin
Rabham and Jon Pattis, could be released if Washington freed
Dhoruba-al-Mujahid, Elmer Pratt and Khalifa Hammas Abdul Khalis,
whom it identified as ``political prisoners'' in the United States.
   The newspaper suggested that the Rev. Jesse Jackson or former
U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark could act as mediators in the
release.
   In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman, Nancy Beck, said:
``We have no comment on that other than our general policy, which
is that all of the hostages should be freed unconditionally.''
   Pattis, a 53-year-old engineer, was arrested in June 1986 after
being accused of passing Iranian military secrets to the Central
Intelligence Agency for use by Iraqi bombers in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The daily referred to him as ``a self-confessed CIA operative''
who entered Iran on an Italian passport to work on a
telecommunications project.
   It said Rabham, a businessman who has been jailed in Iran for
about 10 years, was ``behind bars essentially because of an
indiscretion by former President Jimmy Carter.''
   It said Rabham's crime was that after Iranian militants stormed
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held 52 Americans
hostage, then-President Carter ``had a direct telephone
conversation with his boyhood friend which has so far cost Erwin a
decade of his life.''
   No other details of Rabham's jailing were given.
   The militants held the 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
   Kayhan International said Mujahid and Pratt were serving a
combined jail sentence of 40 years. Pratt, the one-time ``defense
minister'' of the Black Panthers, is serving a life term for a 1972
murder conviction.
   Khalis was the leader of the Hanafi Muslim group that in 1977
took over three Washington buildings, including city hall, and held
several hundred people hostage for several days before surrendering.
   A reporter was killed by a shotgun blast fired by one of the
Hanafis and then-City Councilman Marion Barry was wounded by
gunfire.
   The Iranian newspaper called the shooting death accidental and
said the takeover was a demonstration against American justice.

   For friends and foes of the newly licensed
Seabrook nuclear power plant, visions of the future are as
different as the twin reactors on the site _ one licensed and
ready, the other rusty and unfinished.
   Seabrook operators and nuclear industry proponents see the
completed reactor, poised to generate electricity for up to 1
million New Englanders.
   Opponents see the corroded containment dome of Seabrook's second
unit as a beacon of their fight and the nation's anti-nuclear
movement.
   By the time the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted Seabrook's
operating license on Thursday, the twin-reactor plant proposed in
1972 with a pricetag of less than $1 billion had evolved into a
$6.5 billion single reactor and pushed its lead owner, Public
Service Company of New Hampshire, into bankruptcy.
   Critics have promised to appeal the NRC decision. Once the
appeal is filed, the U.S Court of Appeals in Washington would
decide whether the reactor can operate while the legal fight
continues.
   The focus of the court battle will be the federally required
emergency response plans for 17 New Hampshire and six Massachusetts
communities within 10 miles of the reactor. Seabrook is two miles
from the Massachusett line.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis became Seabrook's most
prominent antagonist in 1986 when he refused to submit emergency
response plans for the six Massachusetts communities, saying safe
evacuation was impossible.
   The NRC subsequently accepted evacuation plans drafted by
Seabrook's operators.
   ``It's correct to say there has never been a case where the
court has overturned an NRC license. But it's also correct to say
that there has never been a license issued which has been so
legally vulnerable,'' said Massachusetts Attorney General James
Shannon, who plans to file an appeal along with anti-Seabrook
groups in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.
   Two appeals already were pending in Washington even before the
full commission approved the licensing.
   Arguments have been set for April on appeal of the NRC's
decision to grant Seabrook a low-power license last May. And the
NRC licensing board's Nov. 9 decision to authorize a full-power
license also was appealed.
   While plant foes look to the courts, Seabrook operators are
trying to move beyond history.
   In an interview Friday, Edward Brown, president of Seabrook's
operator, New Hampshire Yankee, was weary of debating the merits of
the evacuation plans.
   Brown instead said he would seek to mend fences with neighbors,
including some New Hampshire communities, that had opposed the
plant.
   ``We have and will continue to try to get them to work with
us,'' he said. ``It's a matter of taking a conciliatory approach,
not of ignoring the issue.''
   Brown said he anticipated cooperation even from Massachusetts
once the plant was operating.
   Also dominating Brown's future is the actual start-up. He said
he expects glitches and shutdowns as the reactor embarks on its
two- to three-month process that will bring the plant to 100
percent power.
   ``We can expect during the full-power ascension _ unless it goes
absolutely flawlessly, which would be unusual _ there are times
when we will take the unit off line to do some adjustments,'' he
said.
   A court victory for plant opponents is not in his vision of the
future.
   They've tried it before, Brown said, and failed.

<HEAD>Transition Talks Going Surprisingly Smoothly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As the surprise fades away over the
United National Opposition's election victory, the tough work
begins: how the Sandinista Front will turn over the reins of
government to its successors.
   So far, the transition talks have been incredibly smooth.
   ``It's all going peacefully, very peacefully,'' President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro told The Associated Press.
   Transition talks started Wednesday, just two days after
President Daniel Ortega conceded defeat in a moving speech.
   Both sides lost no time in naming transition teams: Mrs.
Chamorro chose her son-in-law and campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo,
to head the efforts of the 14-party UNO coalition. Ortega chose his
brother and Defense Minister, Gen. Humberto Ortega.
   After a campaign that saw the worst in the political tradition
of mud-slinging and outright threats, experienced observers are
amazed at both sides' conciliatory attitude.
   ``They're moving around each other very, very carefully,'' an
international observer said. ``We're doing our best to nurture that
attitude.''
   The promoters and caretakers of this new cooperative attitude
have been dubbed the ``Holy Trinity.''
   One of the three, Elliot Richardson, former U.S. attorney
general and special representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, even wrote President Ortega a fan letter.
   ``Your attitude today constitutes an act of true leadership,''
Richardson wrote of Ortega's speech. ``You can count, Mr.
President, with my sincere admiration and respect.''
   La Prensa, Mrs. Chamorro's family daily and for the 10{ years of
Sandinista rule Nicaragua's only opposition newspaper, has been
emphasizing cooperation and reconciliation of this war-torn nation.
It repeatedly calls Mrs. Chamorro a ``president of ALL
Nicaraguans.''
   On its front page Friday, La Prensa ran a story with UNO
denouncing Sandinista distribution of weapons to supporters and
another story with the U.S.-supported Contra rebels saying
Sandinista soldiers are deserting.
   But this time the newspaper also ran a story with a Sandinista
People's Army spokeswoman denying both reports. Before, it would
have derided any official denial of disruptions in the army.
   ``Some of my friends are hard-line Sandinistas and I've seen
their faces: they're stunned,'' an UNO strategist said. ``But my
attitude is not to gloat in front of them. We have to treat them
delicately.''
   Indeed, the little that the press has been allowed to know of
the transition talks has indicated a show of restraint and delicacy
on both parts.
   As the talks progress, UNO leaders have issued measured, sober
statements whose obvious intention is to calm the waters.
   ``We are going to guarantee the orderly, peaceful and democratic
transmission of the supreme command of the republic, as corresponds
to the sacred interests of Nicaragua and the desires of the
Nicaraguan people,'' Lacayo said.
   Calming the waters is something very much needed, as the
Sandinistas nurse the wounds of defeat and deal with the alarming
thought that some of their dearest ``achievements of the
revolution'' might be reversed.
   After his speech Monday, President Ortega met with more than
1,000 top Sandinista cadres, and delivered a fiery address to
15,000 angry and fearful supporters waiting outside a convention
hall.
   ``The day will come when we will govern from above again because
the Sandinista National Liberation Front will stay with the people,
governing from below,'' he said.
   The words pointed to a Sandinista commitment to play the
political game.
   Except for a subsequent statement by Mrs. Chamorro (``I'm the
one who's going to give the orders''), there's been no balking by
UNO so far about the positions Ortega outlined for a peaceful
transition of power.
   Mutual accommodation seems to be the attitude of both parties.
   Just hours after Ortega demanded the dismantling of the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels, Mrs. Chamorro urged the guerrillas to
come home and rejoin civilian life to help reconstruct Nicaragua.
   President Bush issued a similar call to the rebels, who are in
Honduran jungle camps. And the Honduran president sent a special
representative to Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro to work out plans for
the rebels' decommissioning.
   Now it only remains to persuade the rebels to return before Mrs.
Chamorro is inaugurated April 25.
   Addressing another Sandinista demand, UNO leaders said they will
name a civilian defense minister, but Gen. Ortega will remain in
command of the army.
   UNO will set up a special tribunal to hear claims from people
whose property was confiscated by the Sandinistas.
   But peasants who benefitted from the Sandinistas' agrarian
reform _ some 100,000 families _ will keep their property and will
even be given ownership titles to replace the Sandinista land-use
certificates. Property confiscated from dictator Anastasio Somoza
will remain so.
   The banking system will remain nationalized, UNO leaders have
said, allaying Sandinista fears. But true to its pro-capitalistic
policies, UNO also plans to allow private banks.
   For their part, the Sandinistas have allowed young soldiers to
desert. That move is geared both to weeding the armed forces of
non-Sandinista members and easing the shift to the time when Mrs.
Chamorro, as she has promised, bans the mandatory two-year draft
for boys age 16.
   The transition talks have been at the local offices of the
Carter Center. Former President Jimmy Carter, considered the
``father'' of the ``Holy Trinity,'' has taken the commanding lead
in drawing UNO and Sandinistas to the bargaining table to talk and
reason together.
   Joao Baena Soares, the secretary-general of the Organization of
American States is the third component in the triad.
   The short two months remaining until the new administration
starts will be a time of great change and of promise to Nicaragua's
future.
   If all goes well, it will be the first time in Nicaragua's
history that one government hands over power peacefully to another,
a remarkable achievement.

<HEAD>150,000 Demonstrate For Freedom; Union Says 10,000 Miners on
Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 150,000 people shouting
``Victory,'' ``Democracy'' and ``Down with the Communist Party''
demonstrated for political reform outside a downtown cathedral
Saturday.
   The rally, in support of Bulgaria's increasingly popular
opposition, was held on the anniversary of a March 3, 1878,
Russian-Turkish treaty, which ended nearly 500 years of Ottoman
Turkish rule of Bulgaria.
   The demonstration came one day after 15,000 students marched
through Sofia in protest of communist rule.
   The Communists in Bulgaria, unlike those in other Soviet bloc
countries, have retained much of their clout in national politics,
and their moves toward democracy have been hesitant and somewhat
half-hearted.
   Meanwhile, Konstantin Trenchev, leader of the independent trade
union Podkrepa, said 10,000 miners went on strike Friday to protest
non-fulfillment of government pledges.
   Trenchev said his union has a membership of about 150,000 and
plans selected solidarity strikes nationwide.
   The opposition Union of Democratic Forces, or UDF, organized
Saturday's rally before the Alexander Nevski Cathedral and
demonstrations planned for the next few days to increase pressure
on the Communists to relinquish power.
   Talks on Bulgaria's future between the Communist Party and the
opposition broke down on Feb. 12 after the Communists refused to
sign an agreement on key political changes.
   Bulgarian Television covered the opposition rally and showed
official events to mark the national day, including an early
morning church ceremony attended by Premier Andrei Lukanov.
   Most speakers at the demonstration compared the 500 years of
Ottoman Turkish oppression with the lack of freedom and democracy
under 45 years of Communist rule.
   ``It is a pity that the democratic evolution of the Bulgarian
people was halted by force 45 years ago,'' UDF chairman, Zhelyu
Zhelev, told the packed square.``In Bulgaria, like in other East
European countries, there began the establishment of a totalitarian
society following the example of the Soviet society, called
socialism.''
   ``The result you can see for yourself: All the countries that
followed this road find themselves today in a very deep economic,
political and even demographic crisis,'' Zhelev said.
   ``The Communist Party proposes a new democratic socialism, but
where is it? Can you see it?'' he asked. Then answering his
rhetorical question, he said: ``Enough of experiments, leave us
alone.''
   Zhelev said: ``democracy is an ideal, and in the name of this
ideal the UDF wages its battle for the future of our fatherland.''
   He reiterated the opposition would agree to a government
proposal that elections be held in June _ instead of November as
the opposition earlier demanded _ only if certain conditions were
met.
   He said the election should choose a provisional parliament,
which would write a democratic constitution and enact electoral law
for free multiparty balloting at the end of this year.
   Trenchev announced the miners went on strike because they felt
betrayed by the government, which he said twice promised higher pay
and better working conditions but did not fulfill key provisions of
written agreements.
   Trenchev also explained the UDF position on the talks.
   ``We want to see the Communist Party become separated from the
state; we want to dissolve this symbiosis,'' he said.
   The opposition has said it won't return to negotiations on the
country's future if the Communists balk at political reform.

<HEAD>Chief Defendant Denies Securitate Shot at Protesters in Timisoara</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TIMISOARA, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief defendent at the trial of 21
former secret police officers denied Saturday that officers under
his command fired on protesters in the early days of the December
revolution.
   Maj. Gen. Emil Macri also alleged that members of the current
government came to Timisoara to try to suppress the revolt before
it spread across the country.
   Macri and six others are accused of ``committing genocide'' and
face life imprisonment if convicted. The 14 remaining defendants
could be jailed for up to 20 years if convicted on lesser charges
of ``assisting genocide.''
   The revolt against the Communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu
began Dec. 16 in Timisoara, where its violent suppression by
security forces sparked nationwide reaction that eventually spread
across the country.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were tried and executed Dec. 25
on charges they were responsible for the deaths of thousands of
Romanians during their harsh rule.
   Macri was the first to testify in the Timisoara trial. While he
spoke, the other 20 defendants were ordered to stay out of the
courtroom.
   Macri repeatedly denied he ordered security forces to fire upon
unarmed demonstrators, claiming the Securitate secret police force
was not even issued arms in the first days of the uprising.
   ``I was sent to Timisoara on Dec. 17, by (former Securitate
chief) Gen. Iulian Vlad, exclusively to find out whether there were
any foreign spies inciting the people to rise up against the
regime,'' Macri said.
   He at times drew exclamations of disbelief from the courtroom.
   Macri described as a ``typing error'' his reported admission in
pre-trial questioning that the Securitate shot at the people in
Timisoara, adding his forces ``never went out in the street under
arms.''
   In addition, Macri said Col. Gen. Victor Stanculescu, who last
month was appointed Defense Minister, was sent to Timisoara on Dec.
17, to assist Ion Coman, a former Politburo member responsible for
the army and police. Coman had been sent to the city to quash the
revolt and is to be tried in Bucharest.
   Macri said the Interior Minister in the provisional government,
Gen. Mihai Chitak, was also sent to Timisoara, as was Stefan Guse,
the former chief of staff credited with bringing the military to
the side of the revolutionaries.
   Macri said on Dec. 18, he overheard Chitak tell Coman, ``The
boys have done their job well last night.'' He also said an
unidentified senior Securitate official in Timisoara had told him
they could ``sleep quietly tonight because Guse is here.'''
   He said the officers remained in Timisoara until Dec. 22 _ the
day Ceausescu fled the capital _ and then returned to Bucharest.

<HEAD>Democrats Aren't Seeking Dukakis Endorsement</HEAD>

   Ask Democratic campaign aides if they are seeking
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' endorsement for their candidates this year
and their first reaction is to laugh, or mumble something
unintelligible, or to give a ``no comment.''
   Their reaction suggests just how far the governor has fallen
since he ran for president in 1988. During the campaign, when
Dukakis appeared to have a good chance of reaching the White House,
state Democrats were all too happy to have their name associated
with the governor.
   Now, with the state's worsening budget problems, Democrats
running for statewide office are wary of appearing too closely
associated with him. Even Dukakis has quipped that the best favor
he he could do for one Democratic candidate for state treasurer,
House Speaker George Keverian, is to endorse the Republican
opponent, Joe Malone.
   The governor doesn't plan to endorse any Democratic candidate in
the primary, according to his press secretary, Mindy Lubber.
   ``Obviously, post primary, he will be far more active in the
race,'' Lubber said. ``For the harmony of the Democratic party, his
position has always been he's going to stay out of a primary
fight.''
   There was a time Democrats would have lined up to court Dukakis.
   ``The level of positive support at the height of the Dukakis
administration was remarkable, and the fall has been about as
dramatic as one can imagine,'' said Paul Watanabe, who heads the
political science department at the University of Massachusetts in
Boston.
   This year even Democrats with a long history in state politics
are calling themselves ``outsiders.''
   An endorsement by Dukakis might not be the kiss of death, but it
would probably do a candidate more harm than good, Watanabe said.
He doubts any endorsements will be forthcoming.
   ``My guess is he would not endorse anyone without first
consulting them, and my guess is that the advice being given at the
campaigns at this point is to forgo an endorsement,'' Watanabe said.
   State Senator Richard Kraus, a candidate for state treasurer,
laughed when asked if he was seeking the governor's endorsement
this year.
   Then, in a diplomatic vein, said: ``It had not crossed my mind
to ask for it.''
   Kraus finally said an endorsement from the governor would injure
his election bid. ``At first blush, I would have to say that it
would probably hurt. The negatives are so high right now,'' he said.
   Former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, one of the leading
Democratic contenders for governor, ``does not really place any
value on an endorsement at that level,'' said Ernie Corrigan, his
campaign spokesman.
   ``It's just not something Frank Bellotti has even thought
about,'' Corrigan said.
   Mark Longabaugh, the campaign manager for Lt. Gov. Evelyn
Murphy, sounded more enthusiastic about an endorsement than
officials from other campaigns. ``We want everybody's
endorsement,'' he said.
   John Silber's campaign spokeswoman, Michael Regunberg, said ``Uh
... uh ... I don't think we'll comment one way or another.''
   And Rep. John Flood, a Democrat from Canton who was an outspoken
critic of the governor even during the presidential campaign, said
he would use an endorsement of any of his party rivals against them.
   ``Obviously, it would be used by the campaign as a negative,''
he said.
   Flood acknowledged, however, he feels some sympathy for the
governor.
   ``It's to the point where it's sad,'' he said. ``Except for the
fact that he is the CEO in directing the state for the next few
months, I'd show some sympathy for him.''

<HEAD>Leftist Guerrillas Kidnap Mayors, Others</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas on Saturday held 20
people captive, including mayors and other public officials, in an
apparent attempt to disrupt next week's national elections.
   The guerrillas also threatened to kill Colombia's most important
Cabinet minister because he accused the rebels of killing a leftist
mayor last week, a charge they denied.
   In the past three days, national police said, the National
Liberation Army has kidnapped four mayors, three state assemblymen,
one city councilman, three local party leaders, one reporter, four
employees of rural government programs and four ranchers and
businessmen.
   All of the kidnappings were in northeastern Colombia. The mayors
are from the towns of California, Tibu, El Carmen and Hacari.
   The National Liberation Army, an insurgent group led by a former
priest, has joined with other guerrilla groups in proposing a halt
to hostilities through the elections, according to the radio
network Caracol.
   The report could not be verified, and the government did not
respond to the communiques.
   Colombians elect mayors and congressmen on March 11.
   The threatened Cabinet official is Carlos Lemos, the minister of
government. Lemos is in charge of internal security in Colombia and
stands in for President Virgilio Barco when Barco is out of the
country.
   Baro is in Argentina on a state visit.
   The National Liberation Army denied killing the mayor and made
the threat against Lemos in a communique sent Friday to the
country's leftist party, the Patriotic Union.
   The slain mayor, Diana Cardona, of the northwestern town of
Apartado, was a member of the Patriotic Union. She was assassinated
Monday.
   Lemos said it appeared that the National Liberation Army had
killed her, but he did not explain why leftist guerrillas would
murder a leftist mayor.
   Apartado, in the heart of Colombia's banana growing region, has
been the focal point of an intense struggle between right-wing
death squads and leftist guerrillas over the past two years.
   The Patriotic Union Party's ranks have been devastated by
right-wing death squads despite the government's promises to find
the killers. Since the party was organized five years ago, 827 of
its members have been murdered, 72 of them this year.

   President Daniel Ortega attended a
Mass of reconciliation Saturday and joined the nation's top Roman
Catholic leader in appealing for peace as the Sandinista party
transfers power to a new opposition government.
   ``I thought it was very important to send a message in favor of
peace because I think the situation is very tense,'' Ortega said
after the Mass.
   Ortega and his Sandinista National Liberation Front lost last
Sunday's presidential elections to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of
the United National Opposition.
   In a speech that has won him admiration and respect from friends
and foes alike, Ortega accepted defeat and pledged to help carry
out a smooth transition of power.
   His attendance at the Mass was another part of his effort to set
an example in an effort to cool passions.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo praised Ortega for gracefully
accepting defeat in the election, calling it ``a gesture in favor
of democracy and freedom ... a gesture of greatness.''
   ``We are here to pray for peace,'' said Obando y Bravo, who
hails from Ortega's hometown of La Libertad.
   ``We cannot have peace if there is hatred in the heart. Only
from a heart at peace can come a desire for peace,'' he said.
   Many in the rank and file of the Sandinista party fear that
their revolutionary social measures may be undone by the new
government.
   There is also some concern among members of the ruling party
over the future role of the Sandinista army and the Interior
Ministry security forces, which are closely tied to the party.
   There have been public marches by Sandinista supporters urging
that the party keep control of the army and the Interior Ministry,
including one through a southern Managua suburb Friday night in
which protesters burned tires in the streets.
   Transition talks are focusing on control of the army and the
ministry's security forces, which the Sandinistas don't want to
reduce until the U.S.-backed Contra rebels disband.
   ``Those are institutions created to defend the national
sovereignty and the lives of the people. They must be preserved,''
Ortega said of the army and the Interior Ministry after Mass.
   In answer to a question, he said the Sandinistas were willing to
work with the new government supporting ``everything that is in
favor of the popular classes, but rejecting everything that is not
in the national interest.''
   The army, security forces and militias, which defeated the
Contras militarily, have nearly 150,000 men in arms. The new
government wants to reduce its size drastically.
   Ortega, and his wife, Rosario, both wearing blue jeans, came to
the small La Sierrita Church accompanied by their eight children,
including 1-year old Luciana, whom they adopted recently.
   ``We are here to show the president he is not alone,'' said
Sergio Pilarte who, like many in the crowd, wore the red-and-black
bandanna of the Sandinista party and had come to Mass with his wife
and children.

   Here is the statement President
Bush made Saturday upon the departure of Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu following two days of talks.
   Well I was very pleased to welcome my friend, the prime minister
of Japan, here to Palm Springs for two days of very useful and
far-reaching discussions about the critically important
relationship between the United States and Japan.
   In the first instance, I wanted to see Prime Minister Kaifu
again and extend personally my congratulations for his victory in
the recent elections. I also want to express my very high regard
and admiration for the outstanding leadership he has given his
country and his party since he was propelled into office just six
months ago.
   We first met last September, and in the intervening months we've
seen some of the most momentous changes in recent world history. It
is important that the leaders of the United States and Japan come
together and review the entire scope of their relationship at this
time of profound change in the world.
   There are three things that are very clear to me: That our
relationship with Japan will become even more important to us and
to the world in the coming decades; that Japan is moving rapidly to
assume a leading role in the world, as was evident in Prime
Minister Kaifu's recent trip to Eastern Europe, and the nearly $2
billion in assistance that he pledged to the nations of Poland and
Hungary; and that no matter where we look around the world _ from
Eastern Europe to Panama to Cambodia _ the United States and Japan
are working together to promote political and economic
transformations that will strengthen democracies and market
economies.
   Our meetings these two days were not formal negotiations. This
has been an opportunity to come together and take stock of the
entire range of our dealings, from security to economics and trade,
to foreign policy, and to talk about where we're going together as
we move toward the 21st century.
   We talked about how we can expand even further our global
partnership. I believe that in the coming years we have a unique
and challenging opportunity to expand even further our cooperation
on international issues across the board; to strengthen the
political trialogue among the United States, Japan, and our
European allies; to expand our aid cooperation to embrace a larger
effort aimed at prmoting economic and social development in the
third world; and to think about how Japan can more fully play a
leading role in the world's political and economic institutions.
   We talked about developments of recent months in Europe, and
then U.S.-Soviet relationships, and I believe that we're agreed
that our two countries must work closely together to promote the
same kind of positive change in Asia. I reaffirmed to Prime
Minister Kaifu, as did Secretary of Defense Cheney during that
successful visit of his to Tokyo, that the United States is and
will remain a Pacific power, that the United States attaches great
importance, the greatest importance, to its security and political
alliance with Japan, and that our two countries must continue to
strengthen our defense cooperation.
   At a time of great change in the world, our treaty of mutual
cooperation and security has become even more important to ensuring
continued peace and prosperity as democracy and free markets spread
across Asia and the Pacific.
   We also discussed our economic relationship, one of the most
broad ranging and complex set of commercial and financial
interactions in the entire world. And there are many areas of _
economic areas in which we have close cooperation. Think of the
Third-World debt problems, economic policy coordination
collaborated there. And we reaffirm our commitment to that process,
including cooperation in exchange markets.
   We must also remember that Japan is the second largest market in
the world for our manufacturers, and the largest market in the
world for our farmers. Our exports to Japan already total $44
billion, only Canada buys more from us, and our exports to Japan
are going up faster than our sales to the rest of the world.
   The Prime Minister and his government are very aware of the mood
and concern in this country about the continuing impediments to
further growth of our trade relationship. Even with that 18 percent
growth in our exports to Japan last year, we still have a _ a $49
billion bilateral trade deficit. And make no mistake about it, I
want to see that deficit come down, not by restricting our markets
or managing trade, but by further increasing our exports to Japan.
And so in the coming months, our common task must be to further
open markets and expand trade.
   In addition to increasing our exports to Japan, our other key
task is to ensure the success of the Structural Impediments
Initiative that we launched last summer. We're facing some
important deadlines and the Prime Minister and I are calling on our
officials to redouble their efforts to achieve meaningful interim
and final results.
   We must make the SII, the Strategic Impediments Initiative, and
our other trade discussions a success. We must put our economic
relationship on a solid foundation, if we're to achieve the full
promise of our relationship.
   We feel that we've presented some valid ideas about removing
structural impediments in Japan that will improve market access and
reduce our trade imbalances and we look forward to the Japanese
response. But let's face it, these talks are a two-way street. We
Americans must increase our savings, reduce our budget deficit,
provide more incentive for our investors, strengthen our
educational system, focus on producing goods of the highest
quality. So our task is to make the American economy even stronger
and even more competitive and that is a task for America, not for
Japan.
   So, Mr. Prime Minister, I am delighted we had this opportunity
to discuss all these matters. I am confident that during our time
here together, we have launched a process that will continue
throughout 1990 and the coming years, a process that will create a
breakthrough relationship and lead to an era of even greater
cooperation between our two countries.
   Together, we must master our problems and expand our
opportunities. By working together in partnership, the United
States and Japan have the chance to lead, not only our two peoples,
but the whole world, into a new era of peace, freedom, and
prosperity.
   So, Mr. Prime Minister, Toshiki, my friend, thank you for
coming, and I wish you a safe journey home. And may you have great
success in your efforts in the coming months. You have our full
support.

<HEAD>Soldiers Clash With Demonstrators, Deaths Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Security forces clashed Saturday with activists
claiming election fraud in the Asian republic of Uzbekistan, and
some demonstrators were killed, local activists and official
sources said.
   One activist said up to 30 people died, but an official said
fewer than 10 were killed.
   Abdurashid Sharif, a spokesman for the Uzbekistan grass-roots
organization Berlik, said internal security soldiers opened fire on
a crowd of up to 3,000 peaceful demonstrators in the city of
Parkent, about 30 miles from the regional capital of Tashkent.
   He said an angry crowd then stormed the local police
headquarters and set it on fire. It also broke the windows of the
regional Communist Party headquarters, Sharif said.
   Speaking in a telephone interview from Tashkent, he said the
activists were protesting alleged fraud in Feb. 18 elections and
demanding the resignations of elected officials.
   Sergei V. Kharitonov, a spokesman for the Soviet Interior
Ministry in Moscow, confirmed there was a clash in Parkent, a city
of about 200,000 people. Sharif, who visited Parkent with other
Berlik officials, quoted local doctors as saying up to 30 people
were killed by gunfire by soldiers and police. But Kharitonov said
in a telephone interview that both Sharif's figure and an estimate
of 10 dead given by another Parkent resident were too high.
   Kharitonov said he could not give a figure.
   He said there was no curfew in Parkent and Interior Ministry
soldiers were withdrawn following the afternoon clash. The city was
reported calm late Saturday.
   Moslem Central Asia is the latest region of the Soviet Union to
suffer ethnic violence as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev loosens
decades of tight Kremlin control. Last month, 22 people were killed
in rioting in Dushanbe, the capital of neighboring Tadzhikistan
republic.
   In addition, tensions remain high in the Caucasus republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan to the west, where hundreds have been killed
in the past two years.
   Sharif said the initial gathering in Parkent developed
spontaneously without being called by Berlik or any other group.
   He charged that Interior Ministry soldiers were bussed from
Tashkent and opened fire to break up the peaceful crowd. ``There
were no aggressive acts on the part of the residents of the city,''
before the soldiers attacked, he said.
   But a much larger crowd then gathered and attacked the local
police headquarters and the regional Communist Party headquarters,
he said.
   Soldiers returned with armored personnel carriers and a
helicopter, and they opened fire again, killing more civilians, he
said.
   Sharif said the group of Berlik leaders from Tashkent saw no
corpses when they arrived in Parkent. He quoted doctors as saying
the bodies had been taken directly to Tashkent.
   A technician at the local telephone office, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, also said that he had seen the burned-out
police headquarters.
   Sharif said electoral observers from Berlik had witnessed
ballot-box stuffing in Uzbekistan in the Feb. 18 voting for local
and republic offices.
   He said the demonstrators were seeking the resignation of
regional party chief Ismail Salimov and others elected that day.
They also demanded the resignations of two representatives to the
national Congress of People's Deputies, who they say were elected
in fraudulent balloting last year, Sharif said.
   He said Uzbekistan residents are upset by the poor state of the
cotton-growing republic's economy. ``The election comedy exhausted
their patience,'' Sharif said, bringing Parkent residents out into
the streets.

   Here is the statement of Japanese
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu upon his departure Saturday after two
days of talks with President Bush.
   Thank you very much. (Applause.)
   (Through interpreter) George, thank you very much, first of all,
for your warm remarks. I would also, first of all, like to express
my appreciation for the heartwarming hospitality extended to me by
you, George, and Mrs. Bush.
   I am particularly pleased to have had the opportunity to come
together in scenic Palm Springs and to discuss issues at such
length that our two countries face and that relate to peace and
prosperity of the world.
   My meeting with you was a meaningful opportunity to discuss
coordination between Japan and the United States as we move into a
new era of turbulent international situation in search of a new
order based on freedom and democracy. I am fully satisfied that I
was able to share fundamental thoughts with you through in-depth
exchange of views.
   I value very highly the careful but bold initiatives taken by
the president to foster desirable changes in the East-West
relations and to promote arms control and disarmament negotiations.
I am determined that Japan must share responsibility from the
standpoint of its being one of the countries who are responsible
for maintaining and strengthening international order.
   During my recent visit to Europe, I have pledged in concrete
terms support to the East European countries who are seeking to
establish freedom and democracy, and introduce market economies. On
the German reunification issue, the president explained to me that
he conveyed the U.S. position to the Federal Republic of Germany at
the recent meeting between the president and Chancellor Kohl
concerning the adherence of the unified Germany to NATO and the
continued presence of U.S. forces on German soil. I expressed my
appreciation for his explanation, and expressed my admiration for
the efforts by the president.
   The president and I exchanged views on the Asia-Pacific
situation, and we shared the view that the diplomacy of new
thinking of the Soviet Union needs to be actively applied in this
region as well, and that it is important for both Japan and the
U.S. to endeavor together to ensure the political stability and
economic prosperity of this region.
   This year marks the 30th anniversary of the conclusion of the
Japan-U.S. security treaty. Recognizing the roles played by the
Japan-U.S. security arrangements for peace and stability of Japan,
as well as the Asia-Pacific region, I, together with the President,
confirmed the increasing importance of the treaty into the future.
   Furthermore, the president and I shared the view that the
Japan-U.S. security arrangements continue to be the important basis
of Japan-U.S. cooperation in the search for peace through
deterrence and dialogue at the time of evolution of the new
international situation.
   I value the continued role of the United States in this region
as a Pacific power, which is irreplaceable by any other country. I
expressed to the president my determination to extend the
cooperation required to secure the continued smooth operation of
the Japan-U.S. security arrangements, including host-nation support
for U.S. forces in Japan.

<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela thanked thousands of
Zambia's urban poor Saturday for decades of support for his South
African anti-apartheid group.
   Flanked by President Kenneth Kaunda, one of Africa's elder
statesmen, the veteran black nationalist told a rally that Zambians
had greatly suffered because their country played host to exiles of
the African National Congress for more than two decades. The ANC
has been waging a low-level guerrilla war against the white
government of South Africa.
   ``I salute you for your unstinting support. ... I salute you for
your commitment to our struggle,'' Mandela told a boisterous crowd
of about 10,000 people at the Independence Stadium in Lusaka.
   Hundreds of Zambians died or were injured when South Africa
mounted military raids or sabotage attacks on ANC targets in
Zambia, Mandela said. South Africa ``terrorized innocent people''
in Zambia, he said.
   ``What greater sacrifice is there than the shedding of blood for
other people? We in South Africa will not forget your sacrifices.''
   Thousands of well-wishers lined the six-mile route from Kaunda's
official residence to a stadium for the rally, billed as a
celebration of Mandela's release Feb. 11 after 27 years in South
African prisons.
   He was freed after President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa
lifted a 30-year ban on the ANC and announced other reforms. De
Klerk says he wants to bring disenfranchised blacks into the
political system and gain international support for his government.
   Mandela, who arrived at the stadium in an open jeep, told a
restless audience Zambia lost foreign investment because of its
support for African exiles fighting for justice since its own
independence from British colonial rule in 1964.
   He said the Zambian government was spurned by South Africa's
longtime allies in the West because of Kaunda's outspoken
opposition to the apartheid racial system. Zambia, in central
southern Africa, is one of the continent's poorest nations.
   ``The successes we have scored are to a large measure
attributable to your support,'' Mandela said.
   The stadium is in the poor Lusaka district of Mandevu. Many
people in the crowd who waved Mandela posters wore rags and had
bare feet. But they danced to the music of traditional drums,
choirs and an eight-piece jazz band.
   Mandela, who was elected ANC deputy president Friday, also
called for an end to regional conflicts in Angola and Mozambique,
where right-wing rebels are fighting the governments.
   He was to travel to neighboring Zimbabwe on Sunday on the
second, three-day leg of his first foreign trip since 1962.
   Mandela then is to visit ANC facilities in Tanzania and fly to
Stockholm, Sweden, to see ailing ANC President Oliver Tambo, who
has been hospitalized since a stroke.

<TEXT>
   With regard to Japan-US economic relations, the President and I
agreed to continuously enhance our relations with the understanding
that the sound development of economic relations between our two
countries is indispensable to the development of not only our
economies but that of the world economy.
   Although negative aspects of the issues and problems in our
bilateral economic relations tend to be emphasized, as the
President said with profound insight, the two markets are extremely
large for each of us, and our economies are moving in the right
directions, due to the adjustment efforts in the past several years.
   Both the U.S. budget deficit and Japan's current surplus are
being reduced, and their reatios to GNP have been halved. However,
the imbalances are still very large, and we should continue to work
harder.
   The SII is extremely important to consolidate this positive
trend. I am determined to firmly tackle structural reforms of Japan
as one of the top priorities of my new cabinet with a view to
improving the quality of Japanese life, with further stress on the
consumer-oriented economy.
   I hope that the U.S. on its part will promote structural
adjustment, as the President has just said. I told the president of
my determination to maintain such policies as expansion of domestic
demand, improvement of market access, and deregulation.
   The president and I agree that both Japan and the US will make
the maximum efforts for the early solution of pending issues in the
spirit of cooperation and joint efforts between our two countries.
   The President expressed that Japan and the U.S. have worked
closely in dealing with debt problems and economic policy
coordination and reaffirmed his commitment, including cooperation
in exchange markets. The president's statement convinces me to make
maximum efforts for Japan-U.S. cooperation in these areas,
including in exchange markets.
   Having in mind that our solid bilateral relations are
indespensible to the future stability and prosperity of the world,
the President and I share the recognition of the importance of
consolidating our bilateral relations to be the constructive
cooperation. In this context, we share the recognition that it is
important and necessary to further strengthen and expand the
constructive relations in the 1990s, including educational and
cultural exchanges, science and technology cooperation, and two-way
technology transfers.
   U.S.-Japan relations of today, transcending our bilateral
framework, have acquired the significance of a global partnership
with responsibilities for tasks facing the world. The President and
I welcome that the Japan-U.S. global partnership is bearing
specific fruit in such a broad range of fields as response to
regional problems, the management of world economy, economic
cooperation for developing countries, and debt problems,
environment, drugs, and the fight against international terrorism.
   On the problem of drugs, in particular, I highly appreciate the
series of initiatives of the President, and the courageous
determination shown at the Cartegena drug summit. I expressed my
determination to the president that Japan will actively participate
in the international efforts to eradicate illicit drugs.
   I conveyed my intention to the president to promptly implement
concrete measures in support of the democratic government in
Nicaragua and my belief that an early economic recovery is
important for the stabilization of Panama.
   I expressed Japan's position that Japan would look into economic
assistance for the reconstruction of the region as the peace
process in Central America progresses.
   The development of the South Africa situation contains the
possibility towards dismantling apartheid. The president and I
agreed that Japan and the U.S. will continue to consult with each
other on how to eliminate apartheid.
   This year marks the final year of the Uruguay Round. The
president and I agreed that the successful conclusions of the
negotiations is extremely important for the fight against
protectionism and for the construction of the basis for the
continued progress of the world economy as we move toward the 21st
century.
   The president and I reaffirmed our conviction that we should
closely cooperate for the success of the round.
   Japan and the United States are faced with enormous challenges
and opportunities in the strong current of history. Having in mind
the significance of the Japan-U.S. partnership as a foundation for
the stability of the world, I am fully determined to courageously
pave the way, together with the president, toward the 21st century.
Thank you.
   Ladies and Gentleman, I understand that George will stay on here
and have a most wonderful time answering your questions in a press
conference.
   I, however, will have to leave ... in order to return home in
time to answer the questions that will be raised to me in the Diet,
and also in just in time to arrive in Tokyo before the night
landing time limit arrives at 11:00 p.m. in Tokyo.
   Well, I hope that you will not call this night landing time
limit, another structural impediment.

   Here is the transcript of President
Bush's news conference Saturday following two days of talks with
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Q: Mr. President, are you satisfied that the prime minister has
given the sufficient political commitment to break the impasse in
trade talks? Did he offer any trade concessions?
   A: Well, you heard his statement, which I thought was very good.
And all I can tell you is, we had perhaps the best opportunity that
I've seen to have genuinely frank discussions. I met with him
one-on-one yesterday, and then last night sat next to him at
dinner, so I had an opportunity to continue the business part of
the discussion. Then I heard this statement _ we had our other
talks too _ but, I heard this statement today _ and I'd say that _
that the Japanese side knows how important it is to move forward.
And clearly, I have a renewed feeling of how important it is for us
to do some of the things that they were talking about on this
structural impediments side. So, I can't tell you in terms of a
specific commodity or a specific date, but I _ we were just talking
here and all of us are very pleased with the frankness as well as
the spirit of cooperation that I think was reflected by the prime
minister's statement.
   Q: But, do you think he went far enough, sir?
   A: Well, nobody ever goes far enough to do everything exactly
the way we want it, but I think it's _ I think for those who
understand the complexities of this relationship, at this juncture,
I _ we got everything out of this meeting that we had hoped for.
Obviously, we've got things to do, and clearly, the Japanese side
has things to do. I want to say something on that meeting if I
could. The fact that he came here now _ finished a tough campaign,
just given a big speech to the Diet, indeed he gets home at 11 and
has to go to answer questions in the Diet the very next morning _
should be interpreted by Americans in this manner; that the
Japanese feel this relationship is very important. And to the
Japanese side, the fact that I invited him when I did should send a
very important signal that we have this right up in the forefront
of relationships that are critical. And I was very grateful that he
accepted in such short _ short notice, this _ and in a complicated
time frame _ this invitation.
   Q: How confident are you that he can _
   A: Well, I'm _ he's just won a good victory there. He's
solidified his party's position. He himself emerges as a _ I would
say, dynamic new leader. And so, we will simply wait and see. But,
I wish him well.
   Q: Mr. President, there are reports out of Israel that Yitzhak
Shamir is prepared to accept the U.S. formula for
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Do you know anything about that,
and if so, what shape will it take?
   A: Well as you know, we have been working on this for eight
months. And I certainly _ Jim Baker and I were just talking about
it, and I might say I commend him for staying in there, trying to
be a catalyst to get this process going. So, we don't know any of
the details of that. We just talked to our top officials here. But,
I hope it's true, and I hope we can move forward. And if we do,
I'll be glad to salute our secretary of State and others, including
Mr. Shamir, Mr. Mubarak, for hanging in there, trying to get
something moving toward peace. David?
   Q: Has there been any movement, sir? If you don't know about his
final commitment, has there been any movement toward acceptance of
the U.S. format?
   A: Well, there has over the months. But just like the real
world, you take two steps forward and take one step back. I hope
we're going to go forward now. Yeah, David?
   Q: Mr. President, a question about some testimony last week on
the Soviets. Secretary Cheney said he still believes they are
continuing with modernization. Director Webster said in some
testimony he thinks that the military threat seems to be receding
in some significant respects. With your experience in intelligence,
how do you explain these divergent views? And have you adopted
either of them? What would you tell the American people about what
to think about this?
   A: You know, I get asked _ the question is, ``Who's the enemy?''
And I answer, ``Uncertainty, unpredictability.'' And I don't see a
great disconnect between the way you phrased the question as to
whether they are modernizing or as to whether the threat has
receded. Clearly, as you see _ see those troops starting to move
out of various Eastern countries and as you've seen the democracies
coming in, that results in a diminished threat. But it doesn't say
that there is _ that everything is certain and that stability is
guaranteed. I was asked that question in relation to why I felt we
ought to continue to have troops in Europe and why I felt that it
would be good to have a unified Germany in NATO. And the answer is
stability _ safeguard against unpredictability or instability. So I
haven't gone into, David, the testimony of each, haven't read it.
But I really don't see a big conflict there. Craig?
   Q: How long do you give Mr. Kaifu to produce? It seems we've
heard this type of assurances he gave today before. What are you
looking for specifically and when are you looking for it?
   A: Well, we have some time frames. We have some March talks that
I'd like to see successful. But look, we weren't here to throw down
definitive deadlines. That's not the way you deal with _ with
Japan, in my view. But the sooner the better is the way I'd answer
the question.
   Q: But were there any new initiatives, Mr. President? For
example, I mean, you emphasized that this wasn't a negotiating
session. But were there any new initiatives on either side? Any new
proposals? For example, did you recommend some way that he could be
of assistance in Nicaragua?

<HEAD>Kohl Attacked by Government Partners for Polish Border Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The junior partner in West German chancellor
Helmut Kohl's coalition government joined Poland on Saturday in
attacking Kohl for his latest position on the eastern border of a
united Germany.
   One member of the junior party was quoted as saying the
government could break up over the issue if Kohl persists in his
stand.
   Meanwhile, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt returned
to East Germany to do more campaigning for East German candidates
in the March elections.
   The Soviet news agency Tass announced in Moscow that East German
Premier Hans Modrow will ``pay a working visit'' to Moscow on
Monday and Tuesday. No other details were immediately available.
   Kohl on Friday offered Poland a treaty fixing its border with
East Germany, but he said Poland should also confirm its 1953
decision to renounce any World War II reparations. He said Poland
should also ensure protection of the rights of ethnic Germans in
Poland.
   Poland has pushed for the treaty to prevent a reunited Germany
from pressing claims to Polish territory that was part of prewar
Germany. Polish officials angrily rejected Kohl's new proposal.
   On Saturday, Kohl's own government partner, the Free Democrat
Party, added its voice to the criticism.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher was quoted by the
Luebecker Nachrichten newspaper as saying the party and Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union would discuss Kohl's proposal at a
special committee meeting next week.
   ``Everyone knows, whoever keeps the border question open, closes
the door on German unity,'' Genscher was quoted as saying by the
newspaper.
   Other members of the liberal Free Democrats were even more blunt.
   Party chairman Otto Graf Lambsdorff said he was ``in no way
happy'' with Kohl's offer. He said he was surprised ``that the very
delicate topic of reparations should be mentioned by our side.''
   The party's defense speaker, Olaf Feldmann, told West German
state radio that Poland's western border was not something to be
traded.
   ``We Germans have no territorial claims on Poland; we don't want
to and will not question Poland's western border,'' Feldmann said.
   Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, another leading Free Democrat, was
quoted as saying by the Nuernberger Nachrichten newspaper that the
coalition government could be threatened by any more delays by Kohl
in openly agreeing to fixing the current border.
   While Kohl's offer seemed aimed at assuaging criticism at home
and abroad over his refusal to give ironclad pledges on a fixed
border, Polish government officials said it only broadened the
dispute over unification.
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said Friday he was
``astonished'' by Kohl's position.
   Poland wants reassurance that a united Germany will not claim
lands ceded to Poland after Nazi Germany's World War II defeat in
1945.
   Mazowiecki has demanded a seat at unification talks among the
Germanys and the victorious World War II allies _ the Soviet Union,
United States, Britain and France.
   Kohl has repeatedly said Germans have no plans to claim the
territory, but he insists only a future united German government
can sign a binding agreement. Facing close races in December
elections, Kohl has tried to woo a right-wing minority of voters
who want to lay claim to the land.
   In Friday's statement, he again avoided stating outright that a
united Germany would not claim the land, which makes up about a
third of Poland.
   However, government spokesman Dieter Vogel said Kohl supports
the idea of a reunited Germany signing a treaty fixing Poland's
current western border.
   Vogel also said Kohl reiterated his support for both German
parliaments passing an identical declaration pledging to respect
the current borders after East Germany elects its first freely
chosen Parliament on March 18.
   In Erfurt, East Germany, former West German Chancellor Brandt,
who began a thaw in relations between the two Germanys there 20
years ago, returned Saturday for the East German campaign.
   Brandt, honorary chairman of the Social Democratic Parties in
both East and West Germany, waved to cheering crowds from an
upstairs window of the Erfurter Hof hotel. It was the same spot he
appeared on March 19, 1970, after a historic meeting with then East
German leader Willi Stoph.
   ``I'm very moved at this moment,'' the veteran statesman told
the emotional crowds packing the square. ``It's a long road we have
behind us.''
   Now, he said, the final steps to unite the two Germanys must be
taken in a ``responsible, just and balanced manner, and to a good
final result.''

   A: Well, yes, there was a good discussion of that. And I was
very pleased with his receptivity to helping the new democracies
here. They gave 1.95 _ or pledged $1.95 billion _ to help in the
reconstruction in Eastern Europe _ help with the democracies there.
And he was very open minded in response to my plea to be of similar
_ to be of assistance to Nicaragua and Panama.
   So, yes, we had some detailed discussion about that. But it
wasn't as _ you know _ like, by a certain date we would expect a
certain _ like to see a certain amount of money, or anything.
   Q: Anything you could tell us about any details _ for example, a
new way to be of assistance?
   A: Well, just that I felt a commitment on the part of the prime
minister of Japan to assist democracies. And I think that is very
important. And frankly, I think that will help the U.S.-Japan
relationship because I think the people in our country, as I told
him, want to see the Chamorro government succeed, want to see
democracy in Panama succeed. So, in that particular subject matter
I was very pleased with the forthcoming comments from Prime
Minister Kaifu. Yeah?
   Q Will you work to reduce some of the foreign aid to the largest
recipients, like Egypt and Israel, so that you _ the United States
can give more to Eastern Europe, Nicaragua and the countries that
...
   A: Well, I am against earmarking. I am for more flexibility. We
have had discussions with our congressmen, including the chairman
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Some of those discussions
encourage the concept of a fund that gives the president the
flexibility to determine a certain amount of foreign-aid money. So
I'm less interested in reducing somebody than I am getting the
flexibility so that when you see a country come forward and try to
solidify their democracy or work cooperatively with us in the
Caribbean _ as, say, Mr. Manley in Jamaica is doing _ we'd like to
be able to help him more.
   Q: Would it be a bad signal right now with Israel trying to move
toward talks with the Palestinians?
   A: Would what be a bad signal?
   Q: Would the reduction of aid to Israel?
   A: Well, I don't think that _ I don't know that moving towards
peace need be totally equated with aid. I mean, we're talking about
a quest for peace that comes not just in Israel but in Egypt and
everything else. So, I'm not tying those two subjects. But Israel
has some big economic problems. They've got some big problems
facing them that require a very generous apportionment of aid
money, and they are getting that.
   Right here -- this gentleman in the middle.
   Q: To follow on the question of aid to Israel _ Secretary Baker
has suggested that we might tie aid to resettle the Soviet Jews to
an Israeli willingness to not settle the West Bank and to withdraw
some of the settlements from the West Bank and Gaza. Then, the
State Department seemed to equivocate on that. What's your position?

<HEAD>RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.: your position?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A: Well, I'm not sure there was equivocation. My position is
that the foreign policy of the United States says we do not believe
there should be new settlements in the West Bank or in East
Jerusalem. And I will conduct that policy as if it's firm, which it
is, and I will be shaped in whatever decisions we make to see
whether people can comply with that policy. And that's our strongly
held view, and we think it's constructive to peace _ the peace
process, to _ if Israel will follow that view. And so there's
divisions in Israel on this question, incidentally. Parties are
divided on it. But this is the position of the United States and
I'm not going to change that position.
   Q: So will you link aid to resettle the Soviet Jews _
   A: Well, I _ I will just simply reiterate the policy right here
that we are not _ that we are not going to look favorably upon new
settlements. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, before coming to this meeting the prime
minister outlined in a speech in his own parliament new measures to
increase foreign exports to Japan, and he alluded to them in his
departure statement just a few minutes ago. Did you discuss those
with him, and how significant and serious do you see them to be?
   A: New _ new measures to increase ...?
   Q: Foreign exports, U.S. sales to Japan.
   A: Absolutely. It was discussed in _ by me, and the secretary of
State had a good chance to discuss it with the foreign minister. At
dinner our various participants, including our trade people, had a
chance to discuss with _ that whole concept with the rest of the
Japanese delegation, and I had every opportunity to discuss it. And
so it's _ it's something they're quite clear on. We want to, and we
must increase exports. I covered that in my statement and I
listened carefully to what he said about the _ the deficit we have
and the surplus they have.
   Q: Do you feel, though, that he has begun to make some good
moves in the direction of _
   A: Well, I'm very encouraged with _ as I told you _ with, or am
encouraged by the talks we've had, and I am encouraged with the
trend that seems to be taking place, but we've got to do more.
Yeah, Sandy, and then over here to Owen and Frank.
   Q: Mr. President, regarding the hostages, is there any new
movement to report? Is any third country, particularly the French _
there are reports that perhaps French mediaries are working on
behalf of the U.S. to negotiate with people in _ either Iran or
Syria.
   A: Nice try. Let me tell you all something. You people reported
that I called Francois Mitterrand to discuss the release of some
guy that I'd never heard of before, and we denied it, and you keep
coming back at me. I'm not sure _ I think it's good for you to do
that, though, because I have said that if I find a way to get these
hostages released _ and the way to do it is through quiet diplomacy
with the French, the British, the Iranians, or anybody else _ I
will do it. I want those hostages out of there. So keep asking, but
on this case, the answer to your question is no. Yeah, Owen?
   Q: What new ideas came out of your talks to propel the trade
dispute so that you'd get more progress down the road? Any new
ideas you put on the table or that the prime minister _
   A: To do _ what's that?
   Q: New ideas that you put on the table or the prime minister did
to propel the trade talks.
   A: I don't know that we need new ideas. We just need new energy
on both sides. And I did say this _ I said, ``You've got a new
cabinet. And some of your top cabinet officials that are not
engaged in _ that are engaged _ will be engaged in trade
negotiation are not here. And I will tell you that our cabinet
officials _ and I was thinking of Carla Hills, thinking about
Mosbacher, as well as Secretary Brady, and as well as Secretary
Baker _ will be on the next plane, if it will help solve this
problem.'' And he seemed to take on board that sense of urgency.
And I _ I'm _ we'll see where we go. Frank?
   Q: Mr. President, I'm a little confused. In your statement you
said you did put forth new ideas, and you were awaiting a response
from the Japanese. I'm wondering if you could _
   A: That was one of them.
   Q: Okay. Is that it?
   A: (Chuckles.) No, that's not entirely it, but there's some _
we're _ I think we covered the subject very well.
   Q: Well may I ask you, sir, if you believe now, based on your
discussions here, that you will be able _ these two countries will
be able to avoid the punitive actions specified under
congressionally mandated deadlines?
   A: We had a chance to review that, and to review the question of
Super 301. And we did discuss that. We discussed the time frames
involved. We discussed product specificity. And we all know what
they are _ satellites and forest product and super computers and
semiconductors. And, so, yes, we did get a chance to go into all of
that.
   Q: Do you think you'll be able to avoid sanctions?
   A: Well, I'm hopeful we will, because I _ it is going to require
progress. But again, we _ both sides understand the U.S. law on
this. And I think their side understands it more clearly right now.
   Q: Mr. President, 36 senators wrote you a letter on forest
products. What do you tell them and the thousands of timber workers
who think they will lose their jobs if Japan takes our logs and not
our finished lumber?
   A: I tell them the U.S.-Japanese relationship is important. I
tell them I want to see open markets. I tell them I want to see
progress made in that category, along with the other three, and
many others that I have referenced here. That's what I would tell
them. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, why did Mr. Kaifu not bring his trade minister?
   A: He just _ I'm not even sure _ I don't know what their
confirmation process _ I need help _ that they were all totally in
place.
   Q: They are, but just barely.
   A: They are, but just barely. They were appointed, and they had
eight hours to pack up. And I guess that wasn't enough time. But he
just _ I think it was that they _ when I sent him the invitation,
and when we started dealing with who was going to come, it was _ he
wasn't quite sure that everything would be in place, I guess. I'd
prefer that the Japanese side answer that question. Yeah, these two
on the end here.
   Q: Mr. President, do you think these talks are going to be able
to diffuse protectionist moves in Congress?

   Thousands of workers at some of Hawaii's biggest
hotels walked off the job Saturday, leaving some guests without
fresh sheets and towels and otherwise disrupting the state's
$6-billion-a-year tourist industry.
   The strike was called about 3:30 a.m. by Local 5 of the Hotel
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, which has 7,500 members,
said spokesman Rod Rodriguez. The union's membership had voted to
authorize a strike by a 97 percent margin earlier in the week in
the dispute over pay and benefits.
   The strike affected 11 hotels that account for one of every five
hotel rooms in Hawaii and two of every five hotel rooms in Waikiki,
the state's main tourist destination.
   Many hotels were forced to cut back on meal and room services as
managers scrambled to take the places of the strikers.
   Most of the hotels that were struck closed their restaurants and
snack shops, and the hotel restaurants that remained open had
buffet service rather than waiting on tables. There are many
restaurants unaffected by the strike in walking distance of Waikiki
hotels.
   Maid service was cut severely. Many guests didn't get fresh
sheets or towels unless they asked, and those who did get maid
service waited for hours.
   ``It's unfortunate, considering what I'm paying for a room,''
said Jennie Peters of Huntington Hills, Mich. ``We're not thinking
of leaving, though.''
   Union and management leaders couldn't agree even on what the
last contract offer contained.
   Bill Crawford, executive director of the Council of Hawaii
Hotels, said the union rejected a four-year deal that called for
annual wage increases of 5 percent plus hikes in benefits that
boosted the total package to around 7 percent a year.
   Rodriguez said the union calculated the management proposal at
around 4 percent, which he said was lower than the 5 percent
package offered Friday.
   ``Management seems to be going backwards,'' he said. ``The offer
is meager and measly and shows they could really care less about
the hotel workers.''
   Crawford called the union's calculations ``voodoo economics.''
He urged hotel workers to return to work.
   ``The union is making a grave mistake,'' he said. ``Nobody likes
a strike, but the hotels had to stand firm against totally
unrealistic union demands that ultimately could hurt the employees
themselves.''
   One management employee at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in
Waikiki, forced to work a parking booth, said he didn't understand
what the workers were striking for.
   ``I can't believe they want a raise for this job,'' said Merv
Ching, manager of the resort's valet parking system. ``If anything,
they should get a pay cut.''
   Guests were mixed in their views.
   ``I'm a union man and I don't feel comfortable staying here,''
said Gary Flintoff, a member of Painters Local 64 in Tacoma, Wash.
``We've thought about going to another hotel.''
   Tour bus operators _ both union and non-union _ refused to enter
enter resort property to pick up passengers in a show of support
for the strikers. Tourists using those buses were forced to walk to
hotels' main entrances to board on public streets.
   Rodriguez said the union proposed a three-year package that
called for annual wages increases of 8 percent and total economic
benefits that would boost the proposal to 10 percent a year. In
return, the union would drop its demand for a 5 percent room
surcharge and a 15 percent food and beverage surcharge that hotel
workers would share.
   Management rejected the offer, saying it would make their hotels
uncompetitive.
   ``It's unreal and out of context with reality,'' said Crawford.
   The strike followed a ``holiday'' taken Friday by workers in
what the union said was a good-faith effort to try to reach an
agreement. Rodriguez claimed management failed to negotiate with
the intent of reaching a settlement, and said the union would
remain on strike until a substantial offer was made.
   ``There's got to be something to talk about,'' he said. ``We are
calling their bluff.''
   The hotels remained open and were being staffed by management.
There was no word if the individual hotels affected would offer
discounts.
   The affected hotels in Waikiki were Hilton Hawaiian Village,
2,523 rooms; Sheraton Waikiki, 1,900 rooms; Hyatt Regency Waikiki,
1,230 rooms; Princess Kalulani, 1,150 rooms; Ilikai Hotel, 800
rooms; Sheraton Moana Surfrider, 793 rooms; Royal Hawaiian Hotel,
526 rooms; and the Kahala Hilton, 369 rooms.
   Neighbor island hotels affected included the Kona Hilton on
Hawaii Island, 445 rooms; Sheraton Kauai, 456 rooms; and Sheraton
Maui, 495 rooms.

<HEAD>Can Hazelwood be Convicted of Trying Something Impossible?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Exxon Valdez, with 10 of her tanks
spouting oil, was an immovable object when her skipper called out
orders to move ahead, according to expert witnesses in Joseph
Hazelwood's trial.
   Which brought up the question: Can someone be convicted of
trying to do something which is impossible?
   The three witnesses, whose expertise is costing the State of
Alaska about $90,000, were not hired to comment on the impossiblity
of getting the tanker off Bligh Reef after it went aground. That
was a defense point.
   The consultants came to tell jurors that Hazelwood, charged with
felony criminal mischief in the nation's worst oil spill, was
reckless when he gave the order to start the engines because he
risked capsizing or sinking the massive vessel.
   But defense attorneys Michael Chalos and Dick Madson used their
cross-examinations to suggest there was no such risk because the
Exxon Valdez was firmly impaled and wasn't going anywhere.
   Like most legal issues, the so-called ``impossiblity doctrine''
is a subject of debate and interpretation.
   In newly filed legal briefs, the prosecution contends that
Hazelwood's intentions are the paramount issue because he didn't
know in the darkness of March 24, 1989, whether his ship was
capable of moving.
   ``Captain Hazelwood's reliance on the impossibility doctrine is
misplaced because the issue is not whether it was possible for the
vessel to come free, but whether Captain Hazelwood's mistakes in
not realizing the vessel was firmly aground and not recognizing the
danger in refloating were reasonable,'' said the prosecution's
brief.
   The argument was offered in support of a prosecution plan to
present the results of accident simulations showing the scientific
probabilities of the tanker capsizing or sinking after the
grounding.
   The 987-foot tanker, which left Valdez with a full load of
Alaska crude oil, struck the jagged reef at the entry to scenic
Prince William Sound. Its tanks were gashed, spilling nearly 11
million gallons of oil. Thousands of birds, fish and wildlife were
killed and black goo coated hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with the felony
and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.
   Witnesses have said that Hazelwood gave orders to restart the
engines and move ahead. Several times, they say, he gave rudder
orders which changed the ship's heading, but it didn't budge.
   ``You don't know if the vessel was capable of moving even one
inch, do you?'' Chalos asked expert George Kirk Greiner Jr.
   ``Obviously, it wasn't,'' said Greiner. ``It didn't move.''
   Robert Beevers, a former tanker captain, was adamant in his
testimony that Hazelwood risked further damage to the ship by
trying to move it.
   ``But what if it simply couldn't move?'' asked Madson.
   ``That's what happened,'' said Beevers. ``...That doesn't mean
he wasn't trying to get it off at that point.''
   The third witness, salvage expert William Milwee Jr., said
Hazelwood was reckless in trying to move the tanker because he
didn't have enough information about the ship's position.
   ``I think it was reckless because Captain Hazelwood did not have
enough knowledge of the situation to attempt an immediate
refloating,'' he said.
   Chalos confronted Milwee with calculations of the tanker's
engine horsepower and the ship's grounded condition.
   ``There is absolutely no question this ship would not have moved
using its engines alone,'' said Milwee.
   ``No matter what Captain Hazelwood did?'' asked the lawyer.
   ``No matter what Captain Hazelwood did,'' said the witness.
``But Captain Hazelwood did nothing to try to determine that.''
   He continued to assert that Hazelwood was reckless.
   With the defense scheduled to open this week, Hazelwood's
lawyers plan to present their own computer simulations of the Exxon
Valdez accident, and they will call experts in an effort to hammer
home their impossibility theory.
   But they are not abandoning their original position of why
Hazelwood gave the orders to move ahead. They say he was trying to
stabilize the tanker on the reef.

   Eight captive dolphins given a passage to
open water by an environmental group's act of sabotage instead
huddled together in their saltwater pen and refused to swim free.
   One of the would-be rescuers said the bottlenose dolphins
identified with their captors at the Florida Keys tourist
attraction.
   When the staff at the Hawk's Cay Resort discovered openings cut
in the underwater fence, the dolphins were clustered yards away
from a hole, looking at the gap.
   ``You could have driven a submarine through it,'' pen manager
Kevin Walsh said Friday of the largest 12-foot by 5-foot hole in
the plastic fence at the Duck Key facility about midway between the
peninsula's tip and Key West.
   Sea Shepherd, an animal rights group, claimed responsibility
Friday for the effort the previous week to free the dolphins. The
sabotage was reported to the Monroe County sheriff's office
Thursday.
   No one at the sheriff's office Saturday knew whether charges
would be pressed in the case.
   Dolphins are trained at the resort before being shipped to
sea-mammal pavilions across the country. Some were raised in
captivity, but two were captured in Tampa Bay for Baltimore's
National Aquarium last November.
   Ben White, Atlantic director of the Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society, said local members of a ``dolphin rescue brigade'' cut
three holes in the holding pen to try to free the dolphins in
several late-night forays with scuba equipment.
   The dolphins started ``identifying with the captors and would
not leave the pen,'' White said, adding young dolphins become
dependent on human providers and prefer to stay in familiar
environments.
   Meanwhile, a scientist in Miami said the number of dolphin
deaths in the Gulf of Mexico this winter is running about three
times normal.
   A total of 162 bottlenose dolphins have been found dead from
Texas' Matagorda Bay to Tampa Bay. In a normal winter, only about
50 deaths are recorded in Gulf waters, said Larry Hensen of the
National Marine Fisheries Service.
   ``Some have been emaciated with lots of skin lesions and others
have been nice and robust,'' Hansen said last week. ``Obviously
something different from the normal pattern is going on, but right
now we don't know what it is.''
   The cold snap at Christmas is known to be a contributing factor,
and a lethal strain of red tide that was implicated in a massive
dolphin kill in 1987 and 1988 will be studied as a possibility, he
said.

   A: I hope so, but I don't know. I think that depends on the
results. I oppose protectionism. I'm going to continue to fight
against it. I want to open markets. I want to see a successful
Uruguay Round. But _ and I will do from the Executive Branch side
what I can. But look, I'm not unsympathetic to those that say let's
have markets open further. And that was what was good out of the
meeting; we had a chance to say that. But I think the proof of the
pudding is in the eating.
   Q: You talked to the Japanese?
   A: Yeah. And us on some areas. I mean, if you're talking about
structural impediments, let's get on with some of the suggestions
they make about us, on the deficit and some other areas. I've told
them that we were trying to be more competitive in going forward
with an education program. They happen to support the idea of
capital _ capital gains reductions. And I'd like to see that take
place. So it's not just a one-way street. Yeah, Frank?
   Q: Mr. Bush, a great deal of American money flows out of the
United States through American companies purchased by the Japanese.
Did you discuss the question of restraint by Japanese investment in
this country and _
   A: No.
   Q: Why? Why is that not _
   A: Because I welcome Japanese investment in this country. You
know why? Jobs. American jobs. People working that wouldn't have a
job necessarily if there wasn't that investment. And we _ the
Japanese are not the number one in terms of foreign investment. And
so, the big thing is _ and also, the other reason, Frank, is I
don't want to see barriers thrown up to U.S. investment in other
countries.
   Q: How about _
   A: So that's why it's a free trade concept, plus jobs for the
American working man and woman in this country.
   Q: How about the corollary side of _
   A: And it also has to do with financing a deficit that I'd like
to see Congress help me get down.
   Q: Did you talk about the corollary of lowering barriers to
American investment in Japan?
   A: Yes we did. Yes.
   Q: To what effect?
   A: Well, you've heard me discussing that.
   Q: According to Mr. Fitzwater's statement, you emphasized that
this summit should raise a conceptual framework. What is the
meaning of ``conceptual framework''?
   A: Well, I think I touched on that in my _ in the calling for a
trialogue. We've asked the secretary of State to meet with the
foreign minister of Japan to discuss how we can _ this is the
global effort that we've been discussing, and so that _ I think
that language relates to that particular part of our discussions.
   Q: Are you looking for some new structure for dialogue?
   A: Well, yes. But it's going to require now more conversation
between our foreign ministries. But I think as we see the world
developing into the 90s, it is essential that Japan be included _
U.S., Europe and Japan _ in a lot of these economic _ discussion of
these economic areas. And so, that's what we were talking about
there _ the global _ the global approach to some of these problems.
   But Japan is a key player there, and we've got to structure some
of these organizations accordingly. I think it's thoroughly
understandable that Japan, with its contributions and the size of
its economy, wants to have a stepped-up influence in some of the
multilateral institutions. Well, that would be a discussion. That _
that subject would be something that would come under these
discussions that I've just outlined.
   Q: Just to follow up _
   Q: When you _
   A: You can't follow up on his question, you get a new one. No,
you get a new one.
   Q: Mr. President, when you used the conceptual framework, you
are in mind of SI talks and the Super 301?
   A: Excuse me?
   Q: When you used conceptual framework _ the word ``conceptual
framework''?
   A: Well, I just thought I just explained that to this gentleman
here, probably not as clear as I should have been. But we believe
that Japan will have a _ more of a voice in these international _
international matters. And we are moving accordingly to expand
what, traditionally or heretofore, has been dialogue into three
major factors having an input into it. Yes, Carl?
   STAFF: We're going to take a final question, please.
   Q: Mr. President, you mentioned that the Japanese were aware of
sentiment in the United States and in Congress. Did you
specifically mention that to them, that there have been some
letters in the past week, as you probably know, Senator Bentsen and
Congressman Gephardt have said _ did you specifically tell them
``Congress is pushing very hard on this, we've got to do
something''?
   A: I have _ I had _ in that one-on-one had the opportunity to be
just as clear as any congressman would have liked me to be, and
where this, what needs to happen to keep this terribly important
relationship on track. And similarly, Prime Minister Kaifu was as
frank with me as to how some of what we do is viewed in Japan. So,
it was very good in that regard, and I hadn't seen probably all the
letters from Congress, but you're right, there's a tremendous
amount of interest on that. And those letters were, in a sense,
helpful to me, because they _ the ones that I saw _ because they
depicted a sense of urgency that I hope I was able to convey and
that others in our party were able to convey to our Japanese
counterparts. So, I think in that role _ in that context, those
inputs were very helpful. Thank you all very much. Now _
   Q: The bombing in Panama _ are American servicemen at greater
risk?
   A: We oppose terrorism, and that seems to be a terroristic
action. And it happens, regrettably, all around the world. And that
would be the only answer I could give you, Ann, so I would hope
not. The process of democratization is still strongly popular in
Panama. So, I don't know what that was even about, but if it was
some protest against democracy, why _ so be it. But it's _ must be
condemned by all. Thank you all, very much, and I hope you have a
pleasant day. I know I will.
   (Cross talk as President Bush walks away from podium.)
   Q: (Off mike regarding the donation to the United Negro College
Fund) the $50 million gift of Mr. Annenberg?
   A: Well, it's a little premature. We were planning to discuss
that, but I think it's a wonderful thing. I've long been a
supporter of the United Negro College Fund. Our administration has
stepped up support for historically black colleges and
universities, the endowment concept there. And I think that
generosity _ (inaudible) _ is a challenge _ (inaudible) _ that will
bring on well-deserved support from others. It's most generous and
one of the most brilliant thousand points of light I can think of.
   Q: How about a Nova? (laughter).

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ The war of the cigarettes is on the
move as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. goes head-to-head with its
competition in Marlboro country trying to sell its new Dakota in
Texas and Tennessee.
   Dakota advertisements appeared in Friday newspapers in areas
around Houston and Nashville, said David B. Fishel, a Reynolds
spokesman. The cigarettes should be on shelves within two to three
weeks, he said.
   ``We're going head-to-head with Marlboro, so we had to go where
Marlboro is,'' Fishel said, describing the test-market regions as
thick with Marlboro smokers. Marlboro, made by Philip Morris USA,
is the nation's most popular brand with a 26 percent share of the
cigarette market.
   Referring to protests from anti-smoking groups in Washington,
Fishel told the Winston-Salem Journal, ``Smokers, not anti-smokers,
are going to make a decision on Dakota.''
   Reynolds' decision to proceed with its marketing plan is in
sharp contrast with its reaction earlier this year to discontinue
plans to market another cigarette, Uptown, in a test in
Philadelphia.
   In both cases, anti-smoking groups criticized the company for
trying to sell cigarettes to consumers who are most vulnerable to
the health risks associated with smoking tobacco.
   Although Reynolds announced that it hoped to sell Uptown to
black smokers, the company rejected claims from the Advocacy
Institute that Dakota ads would target young, uneducated,
blue-collar women. The organization, based in Washington, supported
its claims with marketing documents that it leaked to the media.
   In abandoning Uptown, Reynolds said adverse publicity made it
impossible for the company to get an accurate measure of smokers'
reaction to the new brand.
   ``Because they were successful in making it a racial issue,
there was just no way we were going to get any kind of unbiased
read on the brand,'' Fishel said.
   Dakota is aimed at all Marlboro smokers and not at unschooled
women, Fishel said. He also said Reynolds feels the adverse
attention that Dakota has received wouldn't affect the
test-marketing.
   The advertisements are direct in their bid to lure smokers from
Marlboro.
   One of them reads: ``We wanted to develop a new, flavorful
cigarette that's always smooth. With your help, it's finally here.
Dakota. Designed with the Marlboro smoker in mind.''

   Six weary but jubilant adventurers from six nations
completed a seven-month, 3,800-mile trek across Antarctica on skis
and dogsleds Saturday, in the longest unmechanized crossing of the
continent.
   ``It's a dangerous land, without mercy,'' co-leader Jean-Louis
Etienne of France told French television moments after the team
arrived at a Soviet base on the Indian Ocean coast.
   The men were given a huge loaf of fresh bread and chugged
champagne as the flags of their homelands flapped above them in a
strong wind.
   Besides Etienne, the team included American co-leader Will
Steger of Ely, Minn., Victor Boyarsky of the Soviet Union, Geoff
Somers of Britain, Quin Dahe of China, and Keizo Funatsu of Japan.
   Interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Wide World of Sports,'' Steger was
asked what he intends to do now that the journey has ended. He
laughed and said, ``Take a sauna.''
   ``We can relax and join the human race again,'' he said.
   The expedition almost ended in tragedy in its final hours. As
the team struggled through a storm toward the Soviet research base
of Mirnyy, Funatsu disappeared in a blizzard for 11 hours before he
was found Friday.
   Steger said it was ``very close. We were lucky we found him.''
   The crossing was by far the longest of its type across
Antarctica, but apparently not the first without motor power.
   On Feb. 12, Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner and West German
adventurer Arved Fuchs completed what they said was a 1,700-mile
crossing on foot, without the use of sled dogs. They are expected
to arrive in Frankfurt later this month to provide details of their
journey.
   Etienne's team is scheduled to return to France for welcoming
celebrations March 21. They then head to the United States for
ceremonies in Minneapolis _ which along with Paris served as
expedition headquarters _ and in Washington, where President Bush
is expected to meet them at the White House.
   Bush, in a congratulatory message, said: ``Your spirit of
international friendship and cooperation not only helped make this
fantastic journey possible but also set a wonderful example for the
world community of nations.''
   The expedition, undertaken at a cost of about $11 million after
three years of planning, was intended to build support for
Antarctica's preservation and demonstrate the power of
international cooperation. The members had their expenses paid, but
they received no salaries.
   ``Antarctica isn't threatened by pollution, it's still virgin
and white,'' Etienne said in a hookup with reporters in Paris.
``All countries should forget their partisan interests and offer it
to the world .... This continent belongs to everyone.''
   He described Antarctica as ``huge and sometimes monstrous.'' In
seven months, he said, the only other living things seen by the
team were their sled dogs and three birds.
   Experts at expedition headquarters in Paris praised the
performance of the sled dogs, which were trained by Steger. All but
one of the 36 dogs used on the expedition survived, and a special
high-nutrition diet appeared to have kept them in excellent health.
   The journey began July 28 near the tip of the Antarctic
Peninsula, which reaches out toward South America. On Dec. 11, the
team reached its halfway point, becoming the first to reach the
South Pole by dogsled since Roald Amundsen in 1911.
   ``The first two months were very, very hard,'' Etienne said.
``We started to doubt after a month whether we would make it.''
   It had been feared bad weather might strand the adventurers on
the continent for as long as a month and jeopardize an elaborate
international tour to tout the expedition.
   But high winds pushed apart ice that had blocked the Mirnyy
harbor, leaving a path for a ship that will take them to New
Zealand. Soviet Antarctic officials in Leningrad told Cathy DeMoll,
the expedition's manager in Paris, that unless conditions change,
loading of the ship will begin Monday.
   The wind was howling at 70 mph and the temperature was 20 below
zero when Funatsu left a Soviet mobile home where he was meeting
with a French film crew Thursday, spokeswoman Jennifer Gasperini
said from Minnesota.
   When Funatsu did not arrive back in his tent for dinner, team
members tied themselves together and searched the area for several
hours before giving up because of darkness, Gasperini said. The
search resumed early Friday, and Funatsu was found about two hours
later, she said.
   Etienne said that when expedition members passed Funatsu calling
``Keizo! Keizo! Keizo!'' he ``jumped out like a mushroom from the
snow. He was in very good shape.''
   ``He had survived by digging a hole in the snow and crawling
inside, just as the dogs do each night to stay warm,'' said
Gasperini, who received the news from support staff.

   President Bush and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu concluded their desert summit Saturday with
no breakthrough on divisive trade issues but mutual promises to
redouble efforts for resolving disputes.
   Kaifu said ``I am determined to firmly tackle'' the underlying
causes of the $49 billion trade deficit with the United States and
other economic conflicts.
   ``Make no mistake about it, I want to see that deficit come
down,'' Bush said, standing alongside Kaifu under a blazing sun
near a lush golf course at a country club where they held two days
of talks.
   Despite the contentious problems, the two leaders went out of
their way to show personal warmth and friendship.
   Bush called the prime minister ``Toshiki, my friend,'' and the
Japanese leader referred to the president three times as ``George.''
   Despite the lack of any major agreements, the upbeat tone of the
talks could give a political boost to Kaifu, who lacks a broad base
of support in his party. ``May you have great success in your
efforts in the coming months,'' Bush said. ``You have our full
support.''
   During the discussions, Bush and Kaifu reviewed a wide range of
issues from the advance of democracy in Eastern Europe to U.S.
forces in the Pacific.
   But America's $49 billion trade deficit with Japan occupied
centerstage at the hastily arranged meeting.
   Kaifu agreed that the trade deficit was ``still very large and
we should continue to work harder.''
   Kaifu said that working to open Japanese markets to American
goods would be a top priority of his new government.
   ``I told the president of my determination to maintain such
policies as expansion of domestic demand, improvement of market
access and deregulation,'' Kaifu said. He added that both he and
Bush had agreed to make ``maximum efforts for the early solution''
of the trade dispute.
   But neither he nor Bush mentioned any new proposals that had
been advanced.
   Bush, speaking at a press conference right after Kaifu's
departure, said the two sides did not need ``new ideas. We just
need new energy on both sides.''
   Asked if he thought the talks could produce enough Japanese
movement to avoid possible trade sanctions, Bush said, ``I hope so,
but I don't know. I think it depends on results.''
   Assessing Kaifu's commitment for progress, Bush said, ``Nobody
ever goes far enough to do everything exactly the way we want but
... we got everything out of this meeting that we had hoped for.''
   Both leaders promised to press forward with negotiations aimed
at resolving a variety of divisive trade disputes.
   And Bush said his top Cabinet officials dealing with trade
matters would be ``on the next plane to Tokyo'' if that would aid
the talks. The Japanese, he said, understood the sense of urgency
with which the United States views the problem.
   Speaking to reporters before leaving for Japan, Kaifu called the
next few months of negotiations ``extremely important'' although he
cautioned that some of America's demands for the removal of trade
barriers would be difficult to accomplish.
   ``We have to be clear about what things will take time, what we
can accomplish and if it turns out that something is impossible, we
need to explain why,'' Kaifu said.
   Both leaders also said the United States has to reduce its $152
billion budget deficit.
   On other issues, Bush said, ``No matter where we look around the
world _ from Eastern Europe to Panama to Cambodia _ the United
States and Japan are working together to promote political economic
transformations that will strengthen democracies and market
economies.
   He praised Kaifu for agreeing to provide almost $2 billion in
assistance to Poland and Hungary and said the two had discussed
ways to ``expand even further our global partnership.''
   Kaifu said he told Bush that Japan would look into economic
assistance for Central America, specifically Nicaragua and Panama.
   Bush said he reaffirmed to Kaifu that the United States would
remain a Pacific power, and Kaifu indicated he agreed with that
decision.
   Before the leaders met, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
conferred separately with Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama.
   Baker promised that the administration would resist
protectionist sentiment in the United States but warned there are
growing pressures for sanctions against Japan unless trade
frictions cool, Japanese officials said.
   Going into the discussions, Kaifu said action by Japan was
``absolutely necessary.''
   His comment was seen as a positive response to U.S. demands for
progress in talks aimed at attacking the underlying causes of
America's $49 billion annual trade deficit with Japan, and
negotiations on trade disputes involving satellites, supercomputers
and lumber.
   U.S. officials said they did not expect any breakthrough on
specific trade differences but hoped for a commitment from Kaifu
for action.
   The two leaders met at a posh country club surrounded by
mountains in this famous desert community, home to celebrities
ranging from Bob Hope to former President Gerald Ford. Bush was the
weekend guest of millionaire publisher Walter Annenberg.
   The hastily arranged two days of talks were aimed at defusing
growing economic tensions that threaten to erode close political
and security ties between the two countries.
   Relations between the world's two largest economic powers have
been strained deeply by Japan's massive trade surpluses, amounting
to nearly $400 billion over the last decade, and surging Japanese
purchases of property and businesses in America.
   Moreover, there are persistent complaints about Japan's
exclusionary business practices.
   Congress, facing election-year pressures, has imposed deadlines
for talks on a dozen issues ranging from forest products to
supercomputers and even the basic cultural foundations of the two
societies.
   For its part, Japan wants the United States to reduce its huge
budget deficit and increase Americans' savings rate, thus reducing
demands for Japanese imports.
   Kaifu said before the talks concluded that there are some
structural areas where Japanese action is ``absolutely necessary''
_ such as high land prices in Japan _ ``but we must have the
cooperation and understanding (of the Japanese people) on these
issues.''
   Shigeo Takenaka, deputy spokesman for the Japanese foreign
ministry, said both sides acknowledged they faced ``difficult
issues'' on economic conflicts.
   To solve these issues, he said, ``we must continue to strengthen
cooperation in other areas,'' such as aiding Latin American nations
and the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, sent
Bush a letter urging him to ``press (Kaifu) with all the formidable
persuasion at your command to open the Japanese market.''
   Friday's session was devoted to security issues. The United
States is considering reducing its 120,000 troops in Asia by about
10 percent _ or about 5,000 troops in Japan.
   Washington also is pressing Tokyo for a sizable increase in
Japan's $2.4 billion annual support for American troops stationed
in the country.
   Last May, the United States put Japan on a ``hit list'' for
alleged unfair barriers to American wood products, satellites and
supercomputers. The administration has until June 16 to negotiate a
removal of the barriers. If negotiations fail, the administration
can impose retaliatory tariffs, which Japan argues would violate
international trade law.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and the chairman of a Senate trade
subcommittee, prepared legislation that would force the
administration to retaliate if there is no progress by June 16.

   Authorities began to demolish
Bucharest's imposing statue of Vladimir Lenin on Saturday, but
after 10 hours of work it was clear he wasn't going without a fight.
   A pneumatic drill, blow torch and wrecking ball had little
immediate effect on the 25-foot-tall, 7-ton bronze statue.
   ``He doesn't want to leave us,'' joked Florin Badinici, a member
of the governing Provisional Council of National Unity as he
watched the effort.
   The council, which is acting as a mini-parliament until national
elections scheduled for May 20, voted Friday night to tear down the
statue _ a symbol of 45 years of Communist rule that ended in
December with a bloody revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Hundreds of people clapped and cheered as workers hammered away
at the statue in front of the massive, Stalinist-style state
publishing house in the recently renamed Free Press Square.
   The workers vowed to stay through the night if necessary to
remove the Lenin.
   ``Everyone wants to have it down right away,'' said Dan Popescu,
an engineer supervising the removal.
   However, they abandoned their work for the night about 10:30
p.m. with the statue still standing. A few people tossed yellow
paint at it as the workers left.
   Popescu said authorities originally planned to tear down the
statue Monday but changed their minds due to public pressure and
because a Romanian Orthodox priest had begun a hunger strike until
the statue was removed.
   ``We have been improvising, but even we didn't expect this to be
that hard,'' he said. ``Lenin is planted very well here.''
   Popescu's firm, Combinatul Fondului Plastic, installed the
statue in 1960.
   ``Right now, we are ashamed,'' he admitted.
   The pink marble base of the statue was covered with blue
graffiti reading ``Down with the statue.''
   Children scrambled for chunks of marble loosened by the workers.
   The statue depicts Lenin holding his cap and the lapel of his
overcoat and staring into the distance down a broad avenue toward
Bucharest's Arch of Triumph, a rough imitation of the French
monument, built in 1922 to commemorate Romanian unity.
   Authorities said they had not decided what they would do with
the statue.
   Throughout the day, Bucharest citizens stopped to gape as cables
from a crane were looped under the statue's arms and workers
blasted away at Lenin's feet with blow torches and a drill.
   A crane swung a small wrecking ball into Lenin's arm, causing
him to shake slightly.
   ``I'm very glad,'' said Ion Ionescu, 59, watching the
demolition. Asked his opinion of Lenin, he glared and said, ``I've
been working for 40 years and I was able to buy only one car.''
   ``I didn't have holidays or days off,'' Ionescu added.
   Fathers hoisted children to their shoulders to watch. A
demolition worker standing in front of the statue monkeyed Lenin's
pose at one point, provoking laughter.
   ``I'm really glad Lenin is taking off,'' said Mayor Dan
Predescu, supervising the demolition. ``In his place we're going to
have a real work of art.''

   Armenian and Azerbaijani representatives agreed
Saturday to begin talks about peace between their republics but set
aside the territorial dispute at the center of the violence, an
independent journalist said.
   Delegates from unofficial groups in the two southwestern
republics met in the neighboring republic of Georgia, said
journalist Kviria Dali. She said they agreed the two sides should
debate a temporary settlement, but they excluded the issue of the
disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
   Azerbaijan has staunchly resisted Armenian demands that it turn
over control of predominantly Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.
   Ms. Dali, a journalist for an independent Georgian news agency
Matsne, said the sides agreed the proposal from Azerbaijan should
be presented to people in both republics for study. The sides
agreed to continue their talks in two months, she said.
   The journalist said both sides accused Moscow of igniting the
ethnic conflict that broke out in February 1988. Several hundred
people have been killed and thousands have fled their homes since
then.
   Azerbaijani delegates said the representatives should
``temporarily freeze territorial complaints until the fulfillment
of genuine independence of both of these republics in the name of
peace between the two peoples,'' Ms. Dali said.
   Delegates represented groups such as the People's Front of
Azerbaijan and the Constitution Right and National
Self-Determination groups from Armenia. None has official powers,
but the strength of unofficial political organizations has
increased rapidly in the Soviet Union as central authority has
weakened.
   Talks between representatives of the Armenian and Azerbaijani
people's fronts in the Baltic republic of Latvia broke down more
than a month ago after renewed fighting.

   President Bush said Saturday aid to
Israel will be influenced by whether Tel Aviv allows new
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
   ``We do not believe there should be new settlements in the West
Bank or in East Jerusalem,'' Bush told a news conference after
meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. ``I will conduct
that policy as if it is firm.
   ``And I will be shaped in whatever decisions we make to see
whether people comply with that policy.''
   The president had been asked about Secretary of State James A.
Baker's statement that U.S. aid to Israel would be conditioned on a
halt to Jewish settlement of the Israeli-occupied territory.
   Baker told a congressional committee Thursday that $400 million
in loan guarantees to help build housing for Soviet Jewish
emigrants should be linked to Israeli promises it not be used for
new or expanded settlements in the occupied territories.
   Israel says it has no policy of directing immigrants to the
occupied territories, and government leaders denounced Baker's
proposal Friday.
   Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters
Saturday that the president's statements represented nothing new.
He said Bush himself has told Shamir two times that new settlements
must end in the occupied territories.
   But when Bush, and later Fitzwater, were asked directly whether
the United States is linking aid to the settlement question, they
seemed reluctant to put it specifically in those terms.
   ``I will just simply reiterate that the policy right here _ we
are not going to look favorably upon new settlements,'' said Bush.
   ``We haven't expressed it in that policy sense directly,'' said
Fitzwater. ``We don't believe the settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza are conducive to the peace process.''
   Bush was also asked about reports that Israel's Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir has agreed to consider Baker's proposal for makeup
of a Palestinian delegation in preliminary peace talks.
   However, diplomatic sources in Washington said no such decision
has been made.
   On other topics, Bush said:
   _ An explosion in a Panama nightclub that wounded 27 people
``seems to be a terroristic action ... The process of
democratization is still strongly popular in Panama, so I don't
know what that was even about. But if it was some protest against
democracy, so be it. But it must be condemned by all.''
   _ A pending $50 million philanthropic contribution by publishing
magnate Walter Annenberg, with whom Bush is staying in Rancho
Mirage, is ``a wonderful thing.'' Annenberg was to donate the sum
Sunday to the United Negro College Fund, one of Bush's favorite
charities.
   _ There is no truth to reports that French intermediaries are
working on behalf of the administration to free the Americans held
hostage in Lebanon.

   A majority of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Likud Cabinet ministers Saturday reacted favorably to a U.S.
compromise for choosing Palestinians for peace talks with Israel,
Israel radio reported.
   Acceptance of the compromise by hard-line Likud ministers would
be a major step forward in efforts to start a Palestinian-Israeli
dialogue in Cairo, Egypt.
   Shamir's close ally, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, presented the
U.S. proposal to a meeting of nine Likud ministers, but a final
vote was put off until Monday, said Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   ``There were points that were supported. There were other points
which were viewed with suspicions,'' Ahimeir told reporters after
the four-hour meeting.
   Israel Television reported during the meeting that Shamir had
endorsed the U.S. proposals. Ahimeir declined comment on that
report, but he said Shamir had not expressed an opinion at the
meeting.
   The state radio reported that most of the Likud ministers,
including Arens, favored the compromise solution.
   Environment Minister Roni Milo said he expected the issue to
come to a vote in the decision-making, 12-member inner Cabinet
later this week.
   Under the proposal by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, Israel would agree in principle to delegates chosen from
Palestinians who are officially registered as residents of the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The compromise would allow inclusion of Palestinians who had
been deported by Israel as well as residents of occupied lands who
worked or had apartments in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.
   Asked about the reports that Shamir might be ready to accept the
U.S. plan, President Bush said Saturday he had no details.
   ``But I hope it's true, and I hope we can move forward,'' he
said at the news conference in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
   The issue of Palestinian representation has been the main
sticking point in Middle East peace efforts.
   Likud hard-liners have staunchly opposed including deportees and
east Jerusalem residents, saying such acceptance would endanger
Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its unified capital.
   Palestinians have insisted their 10-member negotiating team
include representatives from east Jerusalem, which they want as the
capital of a Palestinian state. They also demand delegates to
represent the 3 million Palestinians who live abroad.
   If agreement is reached, it would clear the way for Baker to
convene a meeting with the foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel to
discuss the proposed delegates on a name-by-name basis. Israel
would have the right to reject candidates.
   Saturday's reports did not address another sticking point,
however: the agenda for preliminary talks. Shamir has demanded it
be limited to his plans for elections in the occupied territories.
Palestinians want an open agenda.
   The elections would be held to allow Palestinians to choose
representatives to negotiate an interim self-government plan for
the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands. Palestinians
have been waging a 27-month-old uprising against Israeli rule.
   The hard-line Shamir has been under pressure from Washington and
from members of the left-of-center Labor Party, Likud's partner in
the coalition government, to accept a compromise so talks can begin.
   Israel army radio reported Saturday that Baker told Israeli
Cabinet Minister Yitzhak Peretz during a meeting last week that if
Shamir rejected the latest U.S proposal, Washington would drop its
mediating efforts and blame Israel for the failure of Middle East
peace efforts.
   Baker told a U.S. House subcommittee on Thursday that ``we have
done pretty much all we can do, we think, from our end, and we are
waiting for a response from the Israeli government.''

   Publishing tycoon Walter H.
Annenberg has pledged $50 million to the United Negro College Fund,
saying he hoped the donation would raise the educational
aspirations of young black people.
   The gift was scheduled to be announced Sunday at Annenberg's
estate, where President and Mrs. Bush are weekend guests. It would
be the largest contribution ever to black colleges.
   Asked about the donation Saturday, Bush, who described himself
as a longtime supporter of the fund, used his best-known label for
private charity in saying he hoped the gift would inspire others to
donate.
   ``Our administration has stepped up support for historically
black colleges and universities, the endowment concept there. And I
think that generosity ... is a challenge ... that will bring on
well-deserved support from others,'' the president said. ``It's
most generous and one of the most brilliant thousand points of
light I can think of.''
   In a statement prepared for the Sunday presentation, Annenberg
said black colleges are a ``major force for positive change ... As
a society, we cannot afford to waste our most valuable resources _
our citizens.''
   Comedian Bill Cosby made the largest contribution to a black
college when he donated $20 million in 1987 to Spelman College in
Atlanta. The United Negro College Fund, a consortium of 41 private
black colleges, raised $45.8 million last year for distribution to
its member institutions.
   The gift by Annenberg, 82, a former ambassador to Great Britain
and former owner of TV Guide, would be one of the largest
contributions to higher education in this country.
   The largest gift to a single institution was in the late 1970s
when Robert W. Woodruff, former chairman of the Coca-Cola Company,
gave $105 million to Emory University in Atlanta.
   ``Unless young blacks are brought into the mainstream of
economic life they will continue to be on the curbstone. The key to
this problem is education,'' Annenberg told the Los Angeles Times,
which reported the donation plans Saturday, as did The New York
Times.
   ``Black colleges have got to be supported,'' Annenberg said.
``The entire country has to get behind this. Foundations,
corporations and private citizens. We can't just leave this for the
government to do.''
   In a prepared statement, Christopher Edley, president of the
fund, said, ``Words cannot do justice to my feelings of gratitude.''
   Annenberg's gift is the lead contribution to the United Negro
College Fund's fourth capital drive, which seeks to raise $540
million for scholarships, capital expenses and faculty development.
President Bush is honorary chairman of the drive.
   The fund was established in 1944 and has raised more than $650
million since then. The fund is well known for its motto: ``A mind
is a terrible thing to waste.''
   Annenberg, former owner of TV Guide and other publications, has
donated $26.5 million to the University of Southern California and
the USC School of Communications bears his name, as does a school
at the University of Pennsylvania.
   Annenberg, who served as ambassador from 1969 to 1974, built his
father's company, Triangle Publications Inc., into a successful
conglomerate. He founded Seventeen and TV Guide, and bought the
Philadelphia Daily News in 1957. In 1988, he sold Triangle for $3
billion to Rupert Murdoch.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's crusade to bury
socialism has hit its most serious obstacle yet.
   Having decimated organized labor, boosted share ownership and
denationalized vast chunks of state-owned industry, the prime
target in Mrs. Thatcher's third term was to be the socialist
bastions of local government.
   But the tax reform Mrs. Thatcher devised for the war on the
local front _ combined with inflation of 8 percent and record
interest rates of 15 percent _ has helped foment a rebellion.
   A Gallup poll published Friday put the Conservatives 18.5 points
behind the opposition Labor Party, their worst showing in nearly 20
years.
   On Saturday, thousands of protesters _ many self-described Tory
voters _ marched noisily in demonstrations around the country.
   The peaceful demonstrations _ in Plymouth, Taunton, Bristol and
Manchester _ included families pushing strollers and senior
citizens carrying ``No Poll Tax'' placards.
   Mrs. Thatcher's idea seemed simple initially: Instead of having
homeowners pay varying amounts of taxes on their property, have
local councils estimate their annual expenses, then divide the
costs equally among all adults in the district.
   Since most local councils are run by socialists, and since
socialists are big spenders, the voters will quickly discover the
cost of electing socialists, Mrs. Thatcher reasoned. The new tax,
formally known as a community charge, thus became known as the poll
tax.
   The government figured that under the new system, which took
effect this year, each adult would pay about $472. Instead, as
amounts are announced, the average is shaping up to be $630, and
surveys show most households will pay one-third more than under the
previous system.
   Mrs. Thatcher insists that this is due to socialist profligacy,
and she accuses councils of exploiting the tax reform to rake in
cash. But high charges have also been levied in Conservative-run
districts.
   A survey in The Times of London on Friday showed that community
charges in only 3 of 69 local councils were close to the $472
estimate. Most showed increases of 30 percent to 50 percent over
last year.
   On Wednesday, 18 of the 25 Conservatives who controlled the West
Oxford District Council resigned to protest having to charge $700
this year, instead of a planned $430.
   The disillusioned Tories blamed reductions in central government
grants and higher wage and welfare bills.
   Reductions of up to 80 percent of community charges are
available to students, the unemployed, low-income pensioners and
others.
   But at the same time, the reform means that a single person in
an eight-bedroom apartment will pay less than a couple living next
door in three rooms, since each taxable adult must pay the same
amount.
   The Duke of Westminster, the richest man in Britain, previously
paid $17,415 property tax on his estate. His community charge is
$709, the same as his resident chauffeur and housekeeper must pay.
   ``I won't pay,'' said Sheila Jackson, a Conservative voter whose
husband earns $240 a week as a plasterer in the south England
coastal town of Weymouth.
   ``We want to pay to our way, we've worked to improve ourselves
... but now this government just makes it impossible,'' she said in
a telephone interview. ``Perhaps this is a case of her (Mrs.
Thatcher) being in power too long. I'm ashamed I voted Tory.''
   The Jacksons paid $555 last year in property taxes, but this
year they face a community charge of $1,140.
   Mrs. Thatcher is being blamed by worried rank-and-file
Conservative lawmakers, gleeful Laborites and swaths of voters in
the Tory heartlands of southern England.
   The media routinely refer to the community charge as ``the issue
that could cost the Tories the next election.''
   ``We will have to think again,'' said lawmaker Sir Marcus Fox,
deputy chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of rank-and-file
Tory members of Parliament. ``From the prime minister downward, I
think we all now know we have a major problem.''
   The next election is not due until 1991 or 1992, and Mrs.
Thatcher has time to quiet the controversy by pouring in government
money to cushion the hardest hit districts.
   So far she has adamantly insisted that the community charge is a
fairer system and will not be changed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of China's Communist Party says the
massacre of protesters in Tiananmen Square last June should not
stand in the way of economic and cultural cooperation with the
United States.
   ``If both sides face realities and make efforts to remove the
misunderstandings, which have not been created by us, we will have
broad prospects in the future,'' Jiang Zemin, general secretary of
the Chinese Communist Party, told U.S. News &amp; World Report.
   ``I suggest that we look forward and try to find common
ground,'' he said in the interview, appearing in the March 12
issue. ``In such fields as economic exchanges, cultural contacts
and other areas there is still a lot of room for more cooperation.''
   But Jiang emphasized: ``We do not regret, or criticize ourselves
for the way we handle, the Tiananmen event.
   ``We believe it to be an internal affair while the U.S. is
saying that we have gone against U.S. values and the American view
of human rights.''
   Jiang said continuing tensions with the United States resulted
from ``a big misunderstanding'' created by inaccurate media
accounts and a limited perspective on the part of the U.S.
government and people.
   Jiang, who became party chief last June amid international
condemnation of the Chinese government's actions, said his
government would continue to welcome foreign investment and open
the country to the outside world.
   ``Because business is not based only on one track, you have to
take the long-term view,'' said Jiang.
   Continued economic development in his country would help change
U.S. and international opinion of China, he said.
   The government also would gradually move away from the
egalitarianism associated with socialist economic enterprises,
Jiang said, by stepping up its policy of incentive and bonus pay.
   Jiang said it was contradictory for the United States to
criticize China's use of troops in Tiananmen Square while saying it
understood why the Soviet Union sent troops to quell riots between
ethnic groups in Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   Additionally, he criticized the U.S. invasion of Panama and
capture of Manuel Noriega as ``a manifestation of power politics.''

   Left- and right-wing demonstrators
rioted in a Hamburg park Saturday, injuring 33 police and an
undetermined number of demonstrators, a city official said.
   According to Werner Hackmann, Hamburg's city official for the
interior, said the rioting began when police tried to stop about
2,000 leftist demonstrators of the Anti-fascist Coordination group
from approaching a small group of skinhead youths in a downtown
park.
   Some demonstrators on both sides attacked the 1,500 police
officers on hand with rocks and firework rockets, and police
responded by using batons and water cannons, Hackmann said.
   Witnesses accused the police of strong-arm tactics, but Hackmann
said the officers had ``prevented much worse happening.''

   Printers of the Japanese translation of ``The
Satanic Verses'' said Saturday the controversial book has nearly
sold out in half a month because of heavy demand and they plan to
print another edition.
   A Shinsen Co. official said the 15,000 copies the company has
printed are almost gone. ``We will publish another 5,000 copies on
March 10 because of the continuing orders,'' he said on condition
of anonymity.
   Many major bookstores will not display the book, however.
   ``Along with some other bookstores, we still are refraining from
selling the book openly,'' said an official of Maruzen, a major
Tokyo book dealer. The official, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Maruzen sells the book only through orders from
customers.
   An official of Kinokuniya bookstore, another major book dealer
with 30 branches nationwide, said there was ``no change in our
policy of not displaying the book.''
   Gianni Palma, the Italian publisher of the Japanese translation,
was attacked by an angry Moslem during a news conference in Tokyo
on Feb. 14 announcing the publication of the Japanese translation.
   Palma ducked and was unhurt when the 30-year-old Pakistani tried
to hit him. The Pakistani was subdued by security officers and
journalists covering the news confernce, held at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Japan.
   Moslems say the the book blasphemes their religion by depicting
the prophet Mohammed's wifes as prostitutes.
   On Feb. 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini urged Moslems to kill Salman Rushdie, the book's author.
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain ever since.

<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on
Saturday promised economic reform and called for boosting
industrial production to ease economic hardship that has prompted
protests, according to news reports.
   Rafsanjani's office also set up a 24-hour hot line to handle
complaints in the face of public frustration after a decade of
economic troubles, revolutionary turmoil and an eight-year war with
Iraq.
   Iranians are contending with soaring inflation, shortages of
almost all basic commodities and high unemployment _ all in part
due to the war with Iraq. A cease-fire was reached in August 1988.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Rafsanjani as saying
Saturday: ``The only solution for economic problems and
revitalizing the society is to increase production.''
   Speaking to managers of state-run industries, most of which are
operating at a loss, he said: ``We do not have political, cultural
or military difficulties currently. Our difficulties are mostly
from a shortage of production.''
   Sources in Tehran reported a number of angry protests last week
caused by popular resentment over continued economic hardship.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, an opposition group, claimed security
forces killed several hundred protesters. There has been no
independent confirmation of that claim.
   Rafsanjani blamed high prices on middle-men, saying they take
advantage of the government's foreign exchange shortfall to import
goods and sell them at exorbitant prices.
   He acknowledged that keeping the Iranian rial artificially
inflated at 70 to the dollar was at the root of the economic
problem.
   The price of imported goods, when converted into rials, are
prohibitively expensive and beyond the reach of most of Iran's 55
million people.
   The government offers the goods at a much reduced price, at a
loss to itself. The subsidized imports, however, are too small in
number to meet growing demand.
   Rafsanjani said: ``It is not advisable to continue the past
policy and provide all goods with the 70-rial exchange rate, even
if there is sufficient foreign exchange to do so.''
   He added that ``what will save the country is that consumer
goods are produced inside the country, and are offered to the
people at reasonable prices.''
   He said the country's reliance on imported goods must be reduced.
   Rafsanjani said in January that factories were operating at 40
percent of capacity.
   Since his election July 28, he has tried to boost the private
sector to increase investment and encourage foreign investment to
revitalize the economy.
   But his efforts have been frustrated by anti-Western
fundamentalist radicals in the Tehran hierarchy, who advocate a
totally nationalized industry and oppose foreign investment.
   Rafsanjani has advocated the privatization of inefficient state
industries, which account for most of the $1 billion deficit
projected in the $57 billion budget for the coming year.

   The Roman Catholic primate of Nicaragua said
in an interview broadcast Saturday he will invite Pope John Paul II
to visit as soon as the political situation settles down.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, archbishop of Managua, also told
Vatican Radio the country's bishops want the Sandinistas to turn
over all power to the new government in line with the ``will of the
people'' shown in the elections last Sunday.
   He referred to the issue of relinquishing power over the
country's security forces.
   John Paul made a 10-hour visit to Nicaragua in 1983. Sandinista
supporters shouted political slogans, disrupting his Mass, and
President Daniel Ortega greeted him with a tirade against U.S.
imperialism.
   ``As soon as things return to normal, we will inform the pope of
our desire. We hope that with all of his pastoral duties, he will
be able to accept our invitation,'' Obando y Bravo said.
   ``We have great affection for him and infinite gratitude and
know that the seeds of his visit have given abundant fruit.''
   The cardinal, who has been a frequent critic of the Sandinistas,
also spoke of a meeting he held with Ortega after the elections and
said the Sandinista leader confirmed he would turn power over to
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the United National
Opposition.
   Obando y Bravo said Ortega mentioned the need for ``guarantees''
regarding the interior and defense ministries.
   The cardinal didn't elaborate but transition talks now under way
are centered on control of the country's army and security forces.
The Sandinista's don't want to give up control of those forces
until the U.S.-supported Contras guerrillas disband.

   Gov. George Deukmejian signed a bill
Saturday to require people buying rifles and shotguns to wait 15
days for a background check, saying it would ``keep more guns out
of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.''
   ``This new law will give peace officers an added tool in their
courageous efforts to protect us from violence,'' the governor
said. ``It will help save the lives of many innocent victims. And
it represents a common sense approach to dealing with the criminal
element in our society.''
   Deukmejian announced in his weekly radio speech that he had
signed the bill.
   The sponsor of the measure, Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly, said
California is the first state to require a waiting period for
police background checks for both pistol and long-gun sales.
   The new law, beginning Jan. 1, 1991, requires buyers of rifles
and shotguns to wait 15 days and undergo the same background check
that purchasers of handguns now have.
   The new law also expands the list of people who cannot buy a gun.
   The bill received impetus in January 1989 when drifter Patrick
Purdy used a military-style assault rifle to kill five Stockton
school children and wound 29 other children and a teacher.
   Connelly's bill was defeated in the Senate in September, but was
given a second chance this month. Lawmakers were moved by the
December killing of two children by their father 15 minutes after
he bought a shotgun at a Yuba City sporting goods store and the
January killing of a Sacramento woman by her estranged husband 40
minutes after he bought a shotgun.

<TEXT>
   Greyhound has salted away millions of dollars to
withstand the walkout by its bus drivers, Chairman Fred G. Currey
said Sunday.
   Currey predicted the strike would be come irrelevant by the end
of March, if it lasts that long, because the company expects to
hire enough replacement drivers to run all its routes.
   The company already has enough drivers to operate half its runs,
and has been overwhelmed with applications by people seeking to
replace striking drivers, said Currey, who heads the only
nationwide bus company.
   Currey said Greyhound would survive because it provides a needed
service, and pays well enough to attract quality employees.
   Currey deplored the violence, including the death of a striker,
that has marred the strike. ``I abhor it. It think it's nonsense; I
think it's immature,'' Currey said in an interview.
   Greyhound was running at 25 percent Saturday, Currey said, and
would be adding more runs each day, reaching full strength by the
end of the month.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, representing
all 6,300 drivers, plus more than 3,000 office and maintenance
workers, went on strike Friday after the two sides failed to reach
agreement over wage issues.
   Currey said 1,800 union-covered employees were at work Saturday,
including 350 union drivers. Another 700 newly hired permanent
replacement drivers were on board, with an additional 300 expected
to join the force next week.
   ``We can operate 100 percent of our system this time of year
with about 2,500 drivers, so 1,000 ... is enough to operate 50
percent of our route system after we get them evenly distributed
across the country,'' Currey said.
   ``That's bogus,'' said union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson, when
asked about Currey's count of union members at work. Although
Nelson couldn't provide hard figures, he said union officials
believe fewer than 10 percent of Greyhound's buses were running.
   Currey led an investment group that paid $270 million for
Greyhound in 1987, then bought Trailways Lines Inc. four months
later for $80 million.
   Prior to the buyout, the drivers union agreed to a 22 percent
wage cut, but Currey said Greyhound drivers remain the highest paid
in the industry.
   Although laden with debt, including about $340 million in
long-term obligations, Currey said Greyhound had accumulated enough
cash to withstand the walkout.
   He would not reveal how much was earmarked, but said one report
of $54 million was ``a conservative'' estimate.
   ``If he's got so much to cushion against a strike, why isn't he
prepared to pay drivers,'' asked Nelson, the union spokesman.
   Currey said money spent dealing with the strike could endanger a
$100 million capital improvement program scheduled for the next
three years, including upgrading buses and terminals.
   Last year, Greyhound earned its first small profit since Currey
bought the company _ $730 million on $1 billion in sales. In the
previous two years, Greyhound lost a total $20 million.
   Currey said the company had modified some of its original
contract proposals without changing the $63 million, three-year
package.
   The union has maintained the company never moved from its
original position.
   Meanwhile, Currey said the company has asked federal courts in
five cities to issue restraining orders against the strike's
violence.
   Also, ``we've asked Ed Strait, the council president, in view of
not only this (fatal) incident ... but violence in other places, to
have the union join with us in going to the courts at every place
we have employees to get a pre-emptive injunction ... to make
certain that violators are dealt with as the criminals they are,''
Currey said.
   Union spokesman Nick Nichols denied that Strait had been
contacted, but he repeated union calls for the walkout to be
peaceful.
   A striking driver was killed in Redding, Calif., Saturday when a
bus driven by a replacement driver was attempting to leave a
terminal blocked by picketers.
   There also has been violence in Chicago, where shots were fired
on a departing bus Friday morning, and in Philadelphia, where rocks
were thrown.

   Two men yelling ``Long live

soldiers and wounded 27 people, including 16 American military men,
witnesses and officials said Saturday.
   The attack late Friday was believed to be the first such raid on
U.S. servicemen since the United States invaded Panama on Dec. 20
and overthrew the government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. One of
the Americans was reported seriously injured.
   ``I heard something come in that broke the glass, hit the table
and then I heard the explosion,'' said Eric Quintero, one of the
wounded. ``There was a lot of confusion, people screaming ...
people on the floor.''
   ``There were people bleeding everywhere,'' he said.
   Witnesses said the grenade landed under a table, then exploded.
It left a hole about half a yard in diameter in one of the disco's
glass walls.
   Lisa McKay, who was outside the discotheque when the 11:30 p.m.
attack occurred, said two men drove up, one got out and threw the
bomb and they then sped away.
   The men yelled ```There goes Noriega! Long live Noriega!' and
threw the grenade,'' she said. Another woman who was going into the
disco at the time gave the same account.
   Panama's Judicial Technical Police, in charge of the
investigation, gave no details, but an official said, ``It was
against the gringos.'' He asked not to be identified.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, said Lt. Cmdr.
Peggy Black, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command.
   Lt. Col. Terry Jones said one of the Americans was seriously
injured. Thirteen others were being treated at the U.S. military's
Gorgas Hospital and two were treated and released, he said.
   Three of the 11 wounded Panamanians had serious injuries and
were in intensive care, a Social Security Hospital report said. It
said six Panamanians were treated and released.
   Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, head of the Southern Command, appealed
for help in finding those responsible.
   ``We ask Panamanian citizens to free their society of these
types of terrorists and criminals. We must work together to bring
these criminals to justice,'' Cisneros said during a meeting with
Panamanian police.
   President Bush said the attack seemed to be a ``terroristic
action. And it happens, regrettably, all around the world.''
   ``The process of democratization is still strongly popular in
Panama. So, I don't know what that was even about, but if it was
some protest against democracy, why _ so be it,'' Bush said, adding
that the attack must be condemned by all.
   Panamanian investigators and U.S. military police were inside
the disco Saturday looking through the debris for evidence.
American soldiers and Panamanian police guarded the building and
kept onlookers and journalists away.
   The disco, My Place, known to be popular with American
servicemen, is just off the busy Via Espana street and a block from
the international banking center in Panama City.
   The attack occurred hours after Noriega's wife, three daughters
and grandson left Panama for Havana. As they left Panama City, they
were surrounded by hundreds of jeering people who shouted ``Go away
beggars!''
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug charges in Miami, where he was
taken after gaining refuge in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City
days after U.S. invasion. He later surrendered to U.S. authorities.
   Officials of the new Panamanian civilian government installed at
the start of the invasion have expressed concern that many weapons
stockpiled by Noriega's Defense Forces around the country still
have not been found. They say their locations are likely known to
members of the Noriega's Dignity Battalions and other paramilitary
groups Noriega organized.
   Some Dignity Battalion leaders have been arrested but most of
the members appear to have returned to normal life in their
communities.
   President Guillermo Endara expressed sadness over the grenade
attack.
   ``It's truly lamentable that there are people so mentally sick
that there is an act of such senseless violence, hurting innocent
people,'' Endara told reporters.
   The Southern Command in Panama broadcast a warning over
television telling U.S. servicemen and citizens to avoid discos,
nightclubs, cafes, movie houses and other public places. But
soldiers were not restricted to bases.
   The United States has about 13,500 troops in Panama, about the
number stationed there before the invasion.
   In Washington, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, taping a Sunday
talk show with CNN, said, ``Panama has been a violent place in the
past and it is still obviously a problem,'' he said. ``You can't
safeguard against every possible contingency. If somebody wants to
to drive by someplace and toss a grenade, I guess that's a
possibility.
   ``But again, we don't know what happened here _ whether this is
an isolated act, whether it was part of some organized effort,
whether it was a group or an individual. We just don't know enough
yet to make those judgments.''

<HEAD>Hungary Expects to Sign Pullout Accord in Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said in an
interview published Saturday he expected to sign an agreement in a
week for the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Hungary.
   Such an agreement would make Hungary the second East Bloc
country to negotiate a pullout of Soviet forces on its territory.
The Soviets began withdrawing the first of their 73,500 troops from
Czechoslovakia earlier this week.
   ``All signs indicate that on March 10 we can sign the
inter-governmental agreement and then get down to its
implementation,'' Horn told the Socialist Party daily Nepszabadsag.
   Horn is scheduled to visit Moscow that day. Both sides in talks
on the withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Soviet troops in Hungary
earlier had expressed optimism that agreement was likely by then.
   However, on Thursday, the head of the Hungarian delegation,
Horn's No. 2 official at the Foreign Ministry, Ferenc Somogyi, said
the two sides could not agree on a timetable.
   Somogyi said that ``in our estimate the pullout of the personnel
and materiel can be completed by June 30, 1991.'' Soviet negotiator
Col. Gen. Matvey Burlakov said Moscow needed an additional two
months because of transport difficulties.
   In the same interview Saturday, Horn denied Hungary was
considering leaving the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance. Last
month, Horn himself stirred speculation by suggesting it was ``not
out of the question'' that Hungary could join the Western military
alliance, NATO.
   But Saturday he was quoted as saying Hungary is ``not planning
any steps which would create tensions within the Warsaw Pact, or
which would dramatically put in question Soviet-Hungarian
relations, and impair (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachov's
position.'' He did not elaborate.

   Carole Gist downplays her place as the
first black Miss USA.
   ``There is so much more to me than my blackness, the color of my
skin,'' she said at a news conference Saturday, the morning after
giving up her Miss Michigan-USA title to be crowned Miss USA 1990.
   Miss Gist, a 6-foot-tall, 20-year-old college student from
Detroit, said she is part Cherokee.
   ``To tell you the truth, Miss Mississippi had a tan that was
darker than me,'' Miss Gist said, drawing laughs from reporters and
pageant officials at a news conference.
   Her fair skin color and her height drew taunts from classmates
in grade school and junior high, she said.
   But being black helped her stand out among the blue-eyed blondes
and brunettes in the pageant, she said.
   Miss Gist said she had a feeling a black contestant was going to
win the contest. The contestants from the District of Columbia and
Tennessee also were black.
   As the titleholder, she goes on to compete in the Miss Universe
pageant in Hollywood on April 15. Five Miss USAs have gone on to
win the Miss Universe crown.
   During her last two years in high school, she said she got her
grade point average up to 3.8 and participated in choir and track.
   ``I had a volleyball scholarship, but I chose not to play
volleyball because I wanted my nails. I didn't want to cut them
off,'' she said.
   Raised by her mother, a legal secretary, Miss Gist said she got
used to responsibility and hard work as a child. She said she was
disappointed when she enrolled at Northwood Institute, a private
college, and school officials would allow her to take only 17 hours
of classes her first semester. Second semester she pushed her
credit hours to 25.
   ``Never give up on your dreams,'' is the message she plans to
carry to others during her reign.
   When she realized she had won title in a televised pageant here
Friday night, Miss Gist put her hands together as if she was
praying and looked up.
   She said Saturday she was thanking God.
   ``I felt truly blessed,'' she said.
   The first runner up was Miss South Carolina-USA, Gina Tolleson,
20, Spartanburg, S.C. The second runner up was Miss New Jersey-USA,
Karin Hartz, 24, Voorhees, N.J.
   The new Miss USA gets $88,000 in cash plus prizes that bring her
winnings to about $220,000. The other prizes include a car, a boat,
furs, jewelry, camera equipment, gowns and a Los Angeles apartment.

   The ruling party Sunday trimmed
proposed pay cuts that have caused unrest, but opposition leaders
said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny has already lost public
confidence with austerity measures.
   Leaders of the country's two unauthorized opposition parties
called for elections, but suggested Houphouet-Boigny remain as a
figurehead in this West African nation he has ruled since
independence from France in 1960.
   Protesters demanding the downfall of 84-year-old
Houphouet-Boigny accuse him of corruption, robbing state coffers
and imposing austerity measures on the poor while government
officials enjoy lavish lifestyles.
   Proposals to cut government workers' salaries by 15 percent to
40 percent and increase a tax on all wage earners from 1 percent to
11 percent have fueled increasing discontent.
   Also, a 10-year recession has provoked the worst economic crisis
in Ivorian history.
   Student protesters have been joined by hundreds of civil
servants and other workers who went on strike Friday.
   In a bid to quell the unrest, state radio Sunday said the
Democratic Party's Political Bureau proposed that only Cabinet
ministers and chairmen of state companies have their salaries cut
by 40 percent.
   ``The other salaries will be relatively little affected by these
reductions, while the very low salaries will be totally spared,''
said the ruling body of Ivory Coast's only authorized political
party.
   It also proposed reducing prices of essential commodities,
low-cost housing, electricity, water, fuel, school supplies and
drugs.
   It said the statement was to reassure protesters involved in
``demonstrations, which some mischief-makers are trying to exploit,
caused by lack of information of militants and people misled by all
kinds of rumor-mongers.''
   Protests that began in Abidjan on Feb. 19 and spread to at least
six other towns in the past few days pose the stiffest challenge
ever to confront the autocratic Ivorian leader.
   Protesters have reacted violently to soldiers and police who
have dispersed peaceful demonstrators in Abidjan with tear gas and
smoke and stun grenades. Demonstrators ransacked several stores in
two Abidjan suburbs Friday and stoned cars and buses.
   The capital was calm Saturday. However, new protests involving
stonings of buses, cars and shop windows were reported in the
western towns of Diwo and Man.
   Unrest that began with similar complaints forced the military
leader of nearby Benin, Brig. Gen. Mathieu Kerekou, to surrender
political power Wednesday.
   Union opposition and mounting unrest forced Houphouet-Boigny to
postpone three times a National Council meeting that previously has
routinely endorsed his decisions.
   Friday night, the Democrats' Political Bureau announced it is
indefinitely postponing the meeting.
   World Bank officials support Houphouet-Boigny's austerity
proposals, saying there is little choice to resolve a liquidity
crisis threatening payment of civil service wages.
   However, opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo, a historian who leads
the Ivorian People's Front, said Houphouet-Boigny ``has his back
against the wall'' and should call democratic elections.
   The president has ignored protesters' calls for a multiparty
democracy, which he says endangers national unity on a continent
divided by tribal rivalries.
   ``When I heard Houphouet-Boigny saying he was cutting salaries,
I thought `He has gone mad,''' Gbagbo told reporters. ``He used to
be very much in touch with the people and could have carried them
with such proposals five years ago, but this shows he has lost
touch.''
   ``The people's misery cannot support ... pay cuts,'' Gbagbo said.
   Robert Bgai Tagro, a former civil servant who heads the
Republican Party, proposed the government halt mandatory
contributions to the ruling party by the country's 110,000 civil
servants.

   Thousands of mostly poor young women
took out guaranteed student loans for a correspondence school they
thought would train them for glamorous careers as travel agents.
   But only 20 percent of the 60,000 students at the American
Career Training School graduated, and 90 percent were saddled with
hefty loan bills for classes some said were nearly worthless, U.S.
Senate investigators have found.
   The school, meanwhile, profited from $150 million in loans and
the owners became overnight millionaires, said the investigators,
who this week accused ACT of fraud in the first of a series of
hearings on problems in the federal student loan system.
   ``It's just too much money being unaccounted for,'' said Grace
T. McPhearson, investigator for the Senate Permanent Investigations
Subcommittee.
   The school, which trains travel agents and motel clerks through
20 home-study lessons and a three-week residential program, has
built a recruiting network in 26 states. Its glossy pamphlets can
be found in welfare offices and its ads in more than 100 newspapers
and magazines, school officials said.
   ACT's ``campus'' is a two-story brick building, with classrooms
full of computers, on a highway of outlet stores and fast-food
restaurants a half-block from the Atlantic Ocean in Pompano Beach.
   Senate investigators say evidence shows ACT altered documents so
that ineligible students could qualify for loans and to make it
appear that dropouts received the refunds they demanded when in
fact no money had been returned.
   The school's president and owner, Joseph A. Calareso, repeatedly
refused to answer the subcommittee's questions Monday on the
grounds that he might incriminate himself. Through his attorney,
Eugene Propper, he denied the allegations and blasted the hearing
as unfair.
   Calareso, a board member of the National Home Study Council,
which accredited the school in 1985, also took steps to pre-empt
further damaging publicity. He hired away the study council's
director of student assistance, Phillip Rokicki, to solve his
financial aid problems and deal with the media.
   ``Mr. Calareso has sent more than $1.25 million back to the
agencies to correct the errors,'' Rokicki said this week. ``It was
never his intention to defraud the government.''
   But the Department of Education's enforcement office has begun a
criminal investigation into whether Calareso and his brother James
committed fraud as they earned more than $12 million in salaries
and dividends from the school in four years.
   Investigators with state loan guarantee agencies in Florida,
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are reviewing thousands of students'
files in hopes of preventing defaults on more than $100 million in
loans they backed for ACT's students.
   Also, Florida's Education Department is considering revoking
ACT's license, and the National Home Study Council has put on hold
its renewal of the accreditation ACT must have to qualify for
federal loan money.
   Some 90 percent of ACT's students received federal loans to pay
about $2,500 in tuition and rent for a room in one of the school's
two hotels.
   But few managed to keep up with the program long enough to
graduate, investigators said.
   Andrea M. Jones of Swansea, S.C., testified that the school
insisted she was liable for the full amount of her $2,415 loan even
though she dropped the course after claiming half the
correspondence lessons weren't mailed to her.
   Rokicki says his records confirm the lessons were mailed to Ms.
Jones. He admits some mistakes, such as delays in the return of
unused tuition money to lenders, but says the school is trying to
correct them.
   Andrea Lynn Merritts-West of New Smyrna Beach told the
subcommittee that only when she began looking for jobs did she
realize that the coursework _ in subjects such as basic typing,
geography and airline reservation codes _ was hardly worth the cost.
   ``The manager of the agency told me that he could teach me more
about the travel industry in just a few weeks than ACT teaches in
their whole process,'' she said.
   Other students, who are paying $150 a week to share a room with
three to four other women at one of the Calareso's hotels, praised
the school this week.
   ``I could have got a job without coming here, but I can get a
better job now that I came,'' said Heather, a student from Glens
Falls, N.Y., who refused to give her last name.
   But Brenda Ann Brandon, a graduate who went on to handle student
loans for ACT from 1985 until she quit in 1988, told the committee
that the Calareso brothers didn't care about the financial burdens
the school was placing on students.
   ``Joseph Calareso was not concerned about the school's default
rate,'' she testified. ``He told me that if we could keep the
volume of loans high enough and the loans spread out, it would take
them forever to figure it out.''

   A pet shop owner who wants to promote pricey pigs
is squealing about a Denver zoning law banning ownership of the
animals.
   Jon Cochran, owner of Pet City, says he gets four or five calls
a month from people asking how they can get miniature pigs _ also
called Vietnamese potbellied pigs.
   ``People are finally coming to the realization that there are
things out there other than dogs, cats and hamsters,'' he says.
   Cochran raised the issue recently at a meeting of the city
council's zoning committee. He was told to draft a formal proposal
for changing the law banning pigs and present it March 21.
   ``Some of the council members thought it was ridiculous that we
were even dicussing this,'' said senior city planner Merlin Logan.
   The potbellied pig, which sells for up to $6,000, is popular
among those looking for a trendy pet.
   ``They're better than dogs,'' said Carolyn Sharp, who breeds
miniature pigs in Fort Collins. ``They're not stinky. They don't
have fleas. They don't bark, and they don't run around in packs
annoying people.''

   A 6-year-old dog named Booger Boy can
receive $400 a month from his late owner's estate, a Superior Court
jury has ruled.
   Two other beneficiaries of the will took the the dog, a chow, to
court, but the dog won.
   When Booger Boy dies a natural death, the will of Martha Jane
Dickie provides the estate will be divided among her eight human
heirs.
   Meanwhile, Nelle Wilson of Chatsworth is given charge of Booger
Boy, along with the dead woman's house and $400 per month to take
care of the dog.
   The will specified that if any of the beneficiaries is involved
in the dog's death, that person will be excluded from the will. Ms.
Dickie died last June at the age of 70.

   The secret military mission of the
space shuttle Atlantis is set to end Sunday, but NASA said a storm
front moving into Southern California would affect conditions at
the landing site.
   Amateur observers said they had already spotted the shuttle's
secret cargo in orbit.
   NASA broke a news blackout on the flight Saturday to announce
that Atlantis would land at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at 1:08
p.m. EST.
   ``Generally, the feeling is somewhat optimistic. It (the
weather) is marginal, but we're going to have to look at it
real-time,'' said NASA spokesman Steve Nesbitt.
   The wind was expected to gust up to 29 mph at landing time, with
scattered clouds and seven-mile visibility, Nesbitt said Saturday
night. Earlier in the day, forecasts called for wind gusting to 20
mph.
   ``That is a little beyond the gust limit,'' Nesbitt said.
   The storm front was expected to make conditions worse later in
the day and ``it's even worse Monday,'' Nesbitt said.
   Weather has affected Atlantis' mission from the beginning. Four
launch delays last week were caused by poor weather. A computer
failure caused a fifth delay, one short of a record for shuttle
missions.
   Atlantis' five-member, military crew spent most of Saturday
preparing for the return to Earth, but because of the secret nature
of their mission no details were released.
   Pam Alloway, Johnson Space Center spokeswoman, said shuttle
crews routinely spend the day before a landing doing housekeeping
chores and testing spacecraft systems.
   A two-sentence statement announcing the landing time also said:
``The crew is doing well and beginning landing preparations and the
orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily.''
   Atlantis was launched early Wednesday. NASA sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the astronauts released a $500
million spy satellite into orbit Thursday. Sources said the
satellite is capable of taking high resolution photos and listening
in on electronic communications around the world.
   According to sources, Atlantis' northeasterly launch, parallel
to the East Coast, put it into an orbit farther north than any
previous shuttle. That would have allowed the astronauts to place
the satellite into an orbit that crosses parts of the Soviet Union
never before observed by a craft launched by the shuttle.
   Though NASA and the Pentagon refused to give details, a network
of amateur observers led by Ted Molczan of Toronto said they were
able to see both the shuttle and the satellite in orbit.
   Molczan said in a telephone interview that an observer in
Scotland saw Atlantis, appearing as a bright, fast-moving point of
light, pass overhead early Friday. The shuttle was followed about a
minute later by a smaller object that Molczan said apparently was
the satellite.
   Later, around dawn over North America, Molczan said observers in
Yellowknife, White Horse and Hay River, in Canada, and in
Fairbanks, Alaska, reported sightings.
   ``For those sightings, the payload (satellite) came over at the
time we predicted for the orbiter,'' said Molczan. ``The orbiter
was seen earlier. This means that the orbiter had dropped into a
lower orbit.''
   Such a maneuver would put distance between the two craft since a
lower object orbits faster. On a later pass over the observers,
there was even more separation, he said.
   Molczan calculated that the satellite was in an orbit of 161
miles and the shuttle was at about 152 miles.
   ``The shuttle and the satellite are extremely bright,'' said
Molczan. ``Brighter than any star.''
   Atlantis' flight is the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth
dedicated solely to the military.
   Navy Capt. John O. Creighton is the commander. Others in the
crew are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and mission
specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col.
Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.

   A quick-moving house fire Saturday
killed six people, including five young children spending the night
together after a birthday party.
   One man was critically injured in the early-morning blaze that
destroyed the three-story home about 10 miles east of Pittsburgh.
   Two neighbor children who stayed overnight after attending an
eighth birthday party for Joshua Harris were killed, along with
Joshua and two siblings, said Allegheny County homicide Lt. John
Brennan. The injured man was a cousin of the Harrises and the dead
man was a friend, authorities said.
   Several neighborhood children who left the party just after
nightfall gathered near the burned remains of the home Saturday
afternoon while firefighers cleared away debris.
   ``I finally made a good friend here, and now he's gone,'' Kevin
Cook, 10, said.
   ``It's lucky we have something to remember him by,'' Richard
Leiche, 5, said. ``We have the party invitation and the Batman toys
we won for prizes during the games.''
   The fire burned for about 1{ hours before firefighters brought
it under control, authorities said. The blaze spread to houses on
each side of the Harris home, but their residents were unhurt,
police said.
   The cause was under investigation.
   In addition to Joshua, police tentatively identified the dead as
James Bennett, 23; Carly Harris, 6; Jessie Harris, 4; Terrance
Cleary, about 5; and Amanda Lee Cleary, about 3.
   The bodies were burned beyond recognition, hampering positive
identification, the Allegheny County Coroner's Office said.
   A man tentatively identified as Ray Steele of Wilkinsburg was in
critical condition Saturday at West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   Dusty Harris, 26, mother of the Harris children, was visiting
neighbors when the fire began and saw the flames when she returned.
   ``There were 12 kids there, mostly school friends and kids from
the neighborhood,'' said Michelle Loughner, a friend of Ms. Harris.
``The party was over about 7:30 p.m. and the kids were in bed by 9
p.m.''
   The fire was reported at 2:15 a.m.
   Sharon Kelley, 37, who lives a half-block away, said she awoke
just after the fire began.
   ``I heard a neighbor scream, and by the time I looked out, the
whole front door was on fire,'' she said. ``My husband and another
man tried to open one of their windows, but they couldn't _ too
much smoke.''
   Joshua turned 8 on Wednesday, but his mother delayed his party
until the weekend.
   Turtle Creek Patrolman Frank Leonardo said he was driving nearby
when the alarm sounded.

   President Guillermo Endara on
Saturday nominated a 60-year-old businessman to be the first
Panamanian serving as permanent administrator of the Panama Canal.
   Endara, in his third day of a hunger strike to pressure the U.S.
Congress for aid to his country, said he was recommending Gilberto
Guardia Fabrega to the U.S. government for approval.
   ``He was chosen among several honorable candidates because in
Panama there are many capable people, but he is the best of all. He
has great experience, great honesty and civic and professional
credentials,'' Endara said.
   No details on Guardia were immediately available.
   Under the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, the U.S. government must
approve Endara's nomination.
   Guardia would replace Fernando Manfredo, who President Bush
appointed as interim administrator. Manfedo, the first Panamanian
to run the shipping route since it began operations 75 years ago,
took over Jan. 1 after the U.S. invasion.

   The family of deposed Panamanian dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega arrived Saturday in Havana after being
granted safe passage by the Panamanian government, news reports
said.
   Noriega's wife, three daughters and grandson were reported en
route to the Dominican Republic, where they have been granted
asylum in the Dominican Republic. Noriega's son-in-law is a citizen
there.
   ``I'm grateful to the Cuban people and to President Fidel Castro
for the hospitality they have given me,'' Noriega's wife, Felicidad
Siero, was quoted by Cuba's official news agency Prensa Latina as
saying in an interview on Cuban television.
   Presna Latina, which was monitored in Mexico City, said the
Noriegas were met at Havana's airport by Miguel Brugueras, Cuba's
assistant minister of foreign relations.
   There was no indication of when they would travel on to the
Dominican Republic.
   The family had been staying at the Cuban ambassador's residence,
where they sought refuge after the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that
overthrew Noriega.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug charges in Miami, where he was
taken after surrendering to U.S. authorities.
   The family arrived at Panama City's airport Friday night
surrounded by Cuban diplomatic personnel, then left for Havana on a
Cubana de Aviacion flight.
   Hundreds of hecklers shouted ``Go away beggars!''
   Some threw pennies at the Noriegas and said: ``This is to pay
your husband's bail.'' The taunt was a reference to a comment by
Noriega's wife that she would travel around Panama asking for
donations for her husband's defense.
   On Wednesday, the Panamanian government said that it would allow
safe passage out of the country for Mrs. Noriega, daughters Lorena,
Thais, Sandra; Sandra's husband, Jean Rene Beauchamps, and the
couple's 7-month-old son.
   Beauchamps, who was the only family member to stay behind, is to
leave next week after discussing allegations of financial
irregularities with authorities. He is to pay a $10,000 bond before
leaving.
   Daughters Sandra and Lorena are accused of corruption, and
Sandra paid a $50,000 bond to leave the country. The government
granted safe conduct passes for the Noriegas on the condition that
they would face extradition if they failed to return to face any
charges.

   A scientist's beaker exploded during an
experiment at a University of Illinois engineering laboratory
Friday, injuring several children attending a campus open house.
   About 27 people suffered mostly minor injuries in the noon-time
accident at the School of Engineering's Noyes Laboratory,
authorities said.
   The beaker exploded when Steven S. Zumdahl, director of the
university's general chemistry program, dripped molten iron into it
to show the hot metal would cause the water to boil, said UI fire
chief William Duckwitz. No chemicals were involved, and the
demonstration had been performed safely in the past, officials said.
   Many of the injuries were cuts and abrasions, Battalion Chief
Bob Walters of the Champaign Fire Department said.
   Most of the injured were children from an elementary school who
were seated in the front row to observe the experiment, WCIA-TV
reported.

<HEAD>Fletcher Outlines Goals as Civil Rights Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arthur A. Fletcher said Friday he hopes to
make discrimination an insignificant part of American life during
his tenure as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.
   ``As a general mission I would like to see us set as an
objective the goal of reducing discrimination to a level of
insignificance,'' by creating an environment in which the ``so
what?'' theory operates, said Fletcher.
   In that environment, Fletcher said he believed employers would
examinine the qualifications, performance and competence of
individuals without considering potential workers' gender, race,
religion or disability.
   Fletcher said he envisioned employers saying ``so what?'' upon
learning subsequently that qualified prospective employees were
African-American, Hispanic, women or other minorities.
   Fletcher outlined the goal to members of the commission at the
panel's first meeting of the year and its first since his
appointment last month by President Bush.
   The commission, established in 1957, evaluates federal laws,
monitors the government's equal opportunity programs and serves as
a clearinghouse for civil rights information.
   Fletcher said the commission should once again become ``the
recognized authority on civil rights matters.''
   In November, Congress approved last-minute compromise
legislation to extend the life of the commission for two years.
   The commission was criticized by civil rights groups and members
of Congress for its positions, including opposition to affirmative
action programs, during the Reagan administration.
   ``I would like to see this commission participate in causing
economic opportunity to become the driving force behind the U.S.
civil rights agenda,'' Fletcher said.
   Such an agenda would respond to an open, free market economy
both domestically and internationallly, he said.
   ``I am convinced that our success or failure in that economy
will rest squarely on how well we develop our human resources ...
and the extent to which we let them perform at their peak
performance level at the workplace and other places and reward them
accordingly,'' he added.
   Fletcher, 65, a moderate black Republican who has served in
three GOP administrations, also said he would work to restore
bipartisanship to civil rights activity.
   ``Although the perception is that civil rights has been solely a
Democratic Party enterprise, there was always the need for ...
Republican votes,'' to pass civil rights legislation, he said.
   Also attending Friday's meeting were two other new commissioners
appointed last month _ Virginia attorney Carl A. Anderson and
Russell G. Redenbaugh, a blind Philadelphia business executive.
   There is one vacancy on the eight-member commission.
   The panel agreed its April meeting would be a two-day retreat
focusing on restoring a colleagial atmosphere to the group.
   Under former chairman William B. Allen, who is still a
commission member, the panel was marked by controversy and
confrontation between he and other commissioners.
   A speech titled: ``Blacks? Animals? Homosexuals? What is a
Minority?'' delivered by Allen to a conservative group was
condemned by the commissioned as ``thoughtless, disgusting and
unnecessarily inflammatory.''

<HEAD>Astronomers Report Finding New Dwarf Galaxy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British astronomers, searching for quasars in far
outer space, said Friday they believe they have stumbled across an
undiscovered galaxy ``in our back yard.''
   They said if their finding is confirmed, it is the first new
galaxy discovered in 35 years.
   Richard McMahon of the Cambridge University Institute of
Astronomy said he and colleague Michael Irwin discovered the very
dim, dwarf galaxy, two weeks ago. He said they are doublechecking
to make sure no one spotted it before.
   ``It's a bit like discovering a new planet; it's an exciting
discovery,'' McMahon said. ``We usually work in a more distant part
of the universe, and we pretty much assume that everything is
already known about the vicinity of the Milky Way'' _ the galaxy
around Earth.
   The scientists used a seven-ton, computerized laser machine that
scans detailed photographic plates of space.
   ``After the plates are scanned, the data are computerized to
look for more subtle variations,'' McMahon said. ``All the easy
galaxies have been found by the eye; the machine finds the harder
ones. The nearer ones are not so easy to see because the bright
background of the Milky Way blurs the picture.''
   The galaxy, named Sextans after the constellation where it was
found, is the smallest of the 10 satellite galaxies of the Milky
Way, the astronomers said in telephone interviews.
   The dwarf, spherical galaxy is 100,000 times fainter than the
Milky Way and cannot be seen without a powerful telescope, they
said.
   ``The sun is 30,000 light-years from the center of the Milky
Way, and this particular galaxy is a factor of 10 farther out. The
edge of the visible universe is about 15,000 million light-years
away, so this is basically in our back yard,'' Irwin said.
   A light-year is the distance that light travels in a vacuum in
one year.
   The scientists said they will follow up their finding with a
more detailed study of Sextans. They predicted that five or six
more galaxies would be found within the next three years.
   ``The odds are there won't be too many more found. If we find
them, fine; if we don't, it's all right, as long as we keep
churning out the unusual stuff,'' said Irwin, adding that he and
McMahon consider themselves specialists in quasars, not galaxies.
   Quasars are starlike objects that emit huge amounts of light.
They are thought to be the ancient traces of the exploding origins
of new galaxies.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. James A. Courter, who lost his
bid for governor last year to Democrat Jim Florio, said Friday he
would not seek a seventh term in Congress so he can spend more time
with his family.
   The conservative Republican congressman made the surprise
announcement at a news conference in the heart of his 12th
congressional district.
   Two weeks ago, Courter announced that he would take a pro-choice
stance on abortion in what many believed was a pre-cursor to his
congressional campaign.
   Flanked by his wife, Carmen, and two daughters, Katrina and
Donica, Courter said he will leave his seat ``with a sense of
accomplishment and a degree of sadness.''
   Courter flashed a familiar smile as he stepped up for the news
conference, but as he spoke, his eyes moistened and his voice
occasionally cracked. He declined to answer questions, promising to
elaborate soon on his decision to step down.
   Hugging his wife, he said, ``I've never asked this before, but
I'd like to spend some time with them.''
   ``They've been a source of strength and inspiration and guidance
during the good and the bad,'' he said. ``Because of my family I've
decided not to seek re-election.''
   ``It's a decision I'm at peace with,'' he added. ``When I first
ran for Congress I said I would serve for 10 years. I guess this
announcement is coming two years too late.''
   Courter, a 48-year-old attorney, did not reveal any plans for
the future. He scarcely mentioned the gubernatorial race, but has
acknowledged in the past that the campaign had been difficult for
his family to endure.
   After winning a tough Republican primary, Courter's campaign was
damaged by what was seen as his changing stance on abortion rights
and he was soundly defeated in his bid to succeed Republican Gov.
Thomas H. Kean.
   Courter was hurt politically by the loss, but analysts said he
retained his popularity in his heavily Republican home base and
would have been odds-on favorite to win another term in Congress.
   Courter, who served as a key member of the House Armed Services
Committee and later on the Iran-contra committee, was first elected
in 1978 in an upset victory that presaged the Republican gains of
1980. He easily won re-election five times, and was a staunch
supporter of President Ronald Reagan.
   Courter said the Reagan policies were responsible for the
``sweeping change in South America, Central America, Asia and
Europe.''
   ``I was glad to be a part of the process to get the U.S. back on
its feet again,'' Courter said.

   In a rare show of unity, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and Labor Party leaders Friday defended resettlement
policies in the face of U.S. threats to withhold aid if Soviet Jews
are allowed to settle in occupied lands.
   Shamir, of the right-wing Likud bloc, said the Bush
administration should reconsider its position, raised Thursday in
Washington by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, his rival and partner in the
coalition government, agreed.
   ``We cannot forbid (an immigrant) to settle wherever he wants,
but basically we do not intend to build new settlements'' in the
occupied lands, Peres said.
   At a hearing before the House Appropriations foreign aid
subcommittee, Baker said the administration could endorse giving
Israel $400 million in loan guarantees to build housing for Soviet
Jews, but only if Israel promises not to put any new settlers in
the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   Israel maintains it has no policy of settling Jewish immigrants
in the occupied territories, captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war. It says that of 12,000 Soviet Jews who came
to Israel last year, 200 settled in the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   ``We do not accept this American position, and we intend holding
a thorough discussion with the U.S. administration,'' Shamir said
in a statement.
   ``The linkage of the issue of immigration and the problem of
settlements was completely unnecessary.''
   Stronger statements came from right-wing legislators and
settlement leaders. Some proposed increasing Jewish settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip to underscore Israel's displeasure.
   Likud legislator Benjamin Begin, son of former Premier Menachem
Begin, said it was ``inconceivable that Jews would be barred from
living anywhere in their historical homeland.''
   Avner Shaki, a Parliament member from the National Religious
Party, said Baker's remarks amounted to ``an unprecedented
intervention in Israel's internal affairs.''
   Rafael Eitan, head of the right-wing Tsomet Party, urged
expanding the settlements.
   About 70,000 Jews live in the Gaza Strip and West Bank along
with 1.7 million Palestinians who are campaigning for an
independent state. During the 27-month-old Palestinian uprising in
the occupied lands, 659 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers and civilians and 43 Israelis have been killed.
   The United States considers further Jewish settlements obstacles
to peace.
   In a sign of the touchiness of the issue, publication of monthly
Soviet immigration figures now will be subject to review by the
military censor.
   The censor's office said Friday ``all material pertaining to
immigration of Soviet Jews must be submitted to the censor prior to
publication.'' Censors are not expected to release the data, so the
process is expected to amount to a ban.
   Maariv newspaper said the decision followed this week's estimate
that up to 230,000 Soviet Jews will come to Israel this year, not
80,000 to 100,000 as estimated earlier.
   Maariv said the newest estimate ``created panic in the Arab
countries, and the protests coming from these countries endanger
immigration.''
   The issue raised tempers at a time when Shamir is already under
pressure at home and in Washington to get U.S.-mediated peace talks
started with Palestinians.
   The State Department tried to smooth over the dispute Friday.
Spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said Baker called Shamir to
emphasize U.S. support for continued Jewish emigration from the
Soviet Union. But she said Washington still wanted assurances that
U.S.-funded housing would not be used in the occupied territories.

   The International Press Institute said Friday it
has protested to the Soviet Union over the detention of three
Turkish journalists in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.
   Institute director Peter Galliner said he wrote to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev on Tuesday to request the release of
the three newspaper reporters detained Feb. 19 in the city of Baku.
   In his letter, he said the detentions violate the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, which guarantees the right of
journalists ``to seek, receive and impart ideas and information
through the media regardless of frontiers.''
   The Turkish Foreign Ministry said it has tried to obtain the
release of Rafet Balli and Mucahit Buber of the Milliyet newspaper
and Irfan Sapmaz of the Gunaydin newspaper.
   The journalists reportedly were detained while trying to board a
plane to Nakhichevan, an Azerbaijani enclave, and charged with
entering the Soviet Union illegally and attempting to enter an area
closed to journalists.
   According to other journalists and unidentified Turkish
officials, the three went to Iran at the end of January and took a
boat along the Caspian coast to Baku. They had no visas for Iran or
the Soviet Union, the sources said.
   The International Press Institute, with offices in London and
Zurich, Switzerland, claims representation of leading journalists,
editors and publishers in more than 60 countries.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of writers, editors and publishers
are holding a conference on homosexual literature to declare their
creativity is ``far from being silenced.''
   Jeffrey Escoffier, co-publisher of the San Francisco-based
literary magazine sponsoring the weekend convention, said 1,200
writers, publishers and agents had signed up.
   Allen Ginsberg, a counter-culture poet of the beat and hippie
movements of the 1950s and 1960s, was the scheduled keynote
speaker. His publisher, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, was acquitted on
pornography charges filed in connection with publication of
Ginsberg's ``Howl, and Other Poems'' in 1956.
   The number of people registered for the conference showed that
``gay and lesbian creativity is far from being silenced,''
Escoffier said.
   ``The power of what we have to say will drown out Jesse Helms
and other conservatives, no matter how much they try to silence
us,'' Escoffier said.
   The North Carolina Republican U.S. senator was the driving force
behind the National Endowment for the Arts censorship last summer
of institutions exhibiting work of the late erotic photographer
Robert Mapplethorpe.
   The NEA has said winners of its 1990 fellowships can't use
federal funds to depict, among other things, homoeroticism _ a
trademark of Mapplethorpe's work.
   Jack Fritscher, a writer and friend of Mapplethorpe's, contends
that would-be censors want to silence ``people who believe in their
own sexuality'' by promoting scare tactics to convince young people
that ``if you do it (have sex), you'll get AIDS; do it and you'll
die; do it and you'll get pregnant.''
   Fritscher _ author of the just-released novel, ``Some Danced to
Remember,'' about gay lifestyles in the pre-AIDS ``Golden Age'' of
the 1970s _ also runs an adult video business north of San
Francisco.
   But he said that 17 states won't allow him to ship the videos
that include advice on safe sex because of ``moral fervor that
boils over in an attempt to clean up society in general.''
   Fritscher, who has a Ph.D. in American literature, said he
believes in parental influence to protect children from
sexually-explicit materials they can't understand, while allowing
adults freedom to chose.
   ``If you can't burn the flag, there's no point in waving it,''
he said. ``And that, taken as a metaphor, fits the whole
situation.''
   In addition to censorship and politics, the conference at the
Cathedral Hill Hotel will examine such issues as responsibility of
authors to deal with AIDS in their writings, the role of gay
journalism, gay writers and the mainstream, and gay magazines,
mysteries, science fiction, poetry and history.
   Mexican playwright Juan-Jacobo Hernandez, founder of the first
Latin American gay publishing house, will moderate a panel
discussion on gay literature in the Mexican, Hispanic and Puerto
Rican cultures.
   Joining him will be Santa Cruz, Calif., teacher Francisco X.
Alarcon, whose poetry collection ``Body in Flames'' is billed as
the first book published by an openly gay Hispanic writer.

<HEAD>Principal Downplays Racial Element in School Disturbance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A high school disturbance in which eight people
were slightly injured and nine students arrested was not divided
along racial lines, said the principal whose firing helped provoke
the incident.
   Police clashed with hundreds of students at Morgan Park High
School on Thursday in a confrontation that began when the school
fire alarm was pulled four times about an hour after a brief
student protest against the firing of Principal Walter Pilditch by
a parent-led panel.
   ``I had one reporter call and tell me that all kids at the
demonstration were white and all the kids injured and arrested were
black,'' Pilditch, who is white, said Friday.
   ``That's all false,'' he said. ``There were blacks and Latinos
in the demonstration for me, and there were two white students
arrested and two white students injured.''
   Four of the eight people injured were police officers.
   The confrontation was the most violent of several protests in
recent days against the firing of principals under Chicago's new
school reform program.
   Councils elected for each of Chicago's 540 public schools in
October have the power to hire and fire principals, and a handful
have done so in recent weeks. Some of the more controversial
firings have involved white principals at mostly Hispanic schools.
   Board of Education spokesman Bob Saigh said he didn't know if
the Morgan Park incident was racially motivated. But it appeared to
have been triggered by the local council's decision to dismiss
Pilditch when his contract expires in June.
   Most of Morgan Park's 1,800 students were in school Friday and
there were no incidents, Pilditch said.
   About 60 percent of the students are black; 24 percent are
white, 12 percent Hispanic and 4 percent Asian.
   Pilditch said about two dozen parents and a dozen ministers came
to the school Friday out of concern for the safety of the students.

<HEAD>Charges Filed Against Medfly-Fighting Helicopter Firm</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   City prosecutors filed misdemeanor
charges against a helicopter company accused of violating a city
ordinance intended to stop aerial spraying of the Medfly-killing
pesticide malathion.
   Six charges were filed Thursday against San Joaquin Helicopters
Inc. of Delano and company operator James C. Josephson, City
Attorney Victor Kaleta said.
   The charges were the first filed under a new law banning
nighttime helicopter formations from flying below 700 feet.
   Six San Joaquin helicopters flew over Pasadena early Feb. 22 in
violation of the law, Kaleta said.
   Arraignment was scheduled for March 22 in Pasadena Municipal
Court. The charges each carry a maximum penalty of one year in jail
and a $1,000 fine.
   The state hired San Joaquin to spray malathion over 400 square
miles of Los Angeles and Orange counties to fight an infestation of
the Mediterranean fruit fly.
   Malathion is mixed with corn syrup as bait, then sprayed. State
agriculture and health officials contend the spraying is safe
despite mounting citizen opposition to the nighttime missions.
   Pasadena's governing Board of Directors, worried about
malathion's possible health risks, last month enacted the
low-flying ban.
   But state officials contend an emergency declaration by Gov.
George Deukmejian supersedes local laws and ordinances, including
Pasadena's helicopter ban.
   The fly lays its eggs in more than 250 varieties of fruits,
vegetables and nuts grown in California, rendering the produce
inedible.

<TEXT>
   State Treasurer Ann Richards told a statewide
television audience Friday night she isn't racially insensitive,
and her two main Democratic rivals in the race for governor agreed.
   However, Ms. Richards' opponents used the televised debate to
highlight her refusal to directly answer questions about whether
she had ever used illegal drugs.
   Former Gov. Mark White and Attorney General Jim Mattox repeated
earlier assertions they'd never used illegal drugs.
   When Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, was asked, she
refused to give a yes or no answer. She said: ``I have revealed
more about my personal life, including my alcoholism, than any
other candidate that has ever run (for governor).''
   Ms. Richards, whose no-holds-barred oratory during the 1988
Democratic National Convention brought wide recognition, is
believed to be trailing White slightly in the race for the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Most polls show Mattox well
behind as the March 13 primary election nears.
   The most personal issue in the campaign to date has revolved
around two remarks attributed to Ms. Richards.
   A newspaper report Feb. 21 said a handwritten text of a 1976
speech by Ms. Richards, who was running for Travis County
commissioner, referred to illegal aliens as ``wetbacks.'' She
denied using the word in the speech.
   Earlier, she was criticized for a remark during a televised
debate that many heard as: ``No legislator, no judge and no
bureaucrat has any business in determining whether a white woman
has an abortion or not.''
   Ms. Richards insists she said ``why a woman,'' rather than
``white woman.''
   In Friday's debate, Ms. Richards noted she has been active in
civil rights causes.
   White at one point turned to Ms. Richards and said: ``I don't
think there's a racist bone in your body.''
   Added Mattox, ``I don't think you're a racist by any stretch of
the imagination.'' But Mattox criticized Mrs. Richards for moving
slowly to address the issue, and also was critical of her refusal
to say if she had ever used illegal drugs.
   ``Ann, Mark and I have known you a long time, and we understand
why you don't want to answer the question,'' Mattox said.
   He said Ms. Richards had ducked the issue on eight occasions
when reporters asked her about drug abuse, and that should she win
the Democratic nomination, the Republican Party would have a heyday
on the issue.
   The four main Republican gubernatorial candidates met in a
similar forum Thursday night. They are oilman Clayton Williams,
former Texas Secretary of State Jack Rains, attorney Tom Luce and
Railroad Commissioner Kent Hance.
   Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, isn't seeking re-election.
   Candidates with little following or chance to win weren't
invited to either debate.

   Two airliners reporting mechanical problems made
emergency landings at O'Hare International Airport within five
minutes of each other Friday night, officials said. No injuries
were reported.
   TWA Flight 829 reported that a warning light went on indicating
problems with its ``anti-skid mechanism'' and landed safely at 7:55
p.m., said Mort Edelstein, Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman.
   ``They have so many light signals on their panels,'' Edelstein
said, ``that when they go on, (pilots) don't monkey around _ you've
got passengers on board.''
   Flight 829 was traveling from New York to Chicago and on to St.
Louis, a TWA official said. The plane, which had 173 people on
board, left O'Hare on its final destination at 8:30 p.m.
   Another airliner, Pan Am Flight 2027 en route to Chicago from
New York with 150 people aboard, reported a loss of hydraulics,
Edelstein said. Both planes were 727s.
   The pilot of Flight 2027 was concerned about making the runway,
according to fire communications officials.
   Edelstein said the pilot manually lowered the landing gear and
the plane was towed to the terminal after it landed safely at 8 p.m.
   To prepare for the emergency, Edelstein said airport officials
alerted emergency personnel and had a score of fire trucks and
ambulances on standby.
   ``We had everything out there because you had two planes that
landed five minutes apart,'' Edelstein said. ``That's an unusual
occurrence anywhere.''

Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company that prepares most of the
nation's bar exams filed a federal lawsuit Friday accusing a
preparation service of stealing questions and undermining the
integrity of the tests.
   The lawsuit was filed by the National Conference of Bar
Examiners, or NCBE, a Chicago company that prepares the Multistate
Bar Examination _ 200 multiple-choice questions administered to law
graduates in 46 states.
   The suit accuses Multistate Legal Studies Inc. of Philadelphia
and Santa Monica, Calif., of sending agents to purposely fail the
bar exam, giving them the right to review the tests.
   While reviewing the exams, the agents memorized, photographed,
hand copied or tape recorded the questions, according to the
lawsuit.
   The suit names Multistate president Robert Feinberg as an agent.
   Feinberg, an attorney living in California, denied the
allegations and noted that his company won a similar suit filed in
1978.
   The NCBE claims the ``integrity and quality of the process by
which applicants are admitted to the practice of law'' was tainted
by Multistate, which also operates under the name of Preliminary
Multistate Bar Review.
   The suit seeks unspecified damages as well as injunctions
against further copyright infringement.
   According to the suit, about 100,000 students in 40 states have
enrolled in the courses with Preliminary Multistate Bar Review
since 1977. The three- and six-day seminars cost $295 to $495 with
an additional $395 for written materials, $100 for cassette tapes
and about $50 for flashcards.
   The Multistate Bar Exam, used since 1972, is given twice a year
on six subjects. About 58,000 applicants took the exam last year.
   Questions are prepared by committees of practitioners, judges
and law professors and reviewed by others at a cost of about
$250,000 per test form.
   The NCBE releases 50 questions to the public every other year,
but does not reuse released questions.
   The NCBE also prepares other portions of the test, including a
essay section and a section on professional responsibility.
   The Multistate Bar Examination is used in all states but
Indiana, Iowa, Lousiana and Washington.

   The state supreme court on Friday upheld
the convictions of two men who got caught with a bag of illegal
fish, then tried to get off the hook by arguing that the game
wardens' roadblock was improper.
   Gary Sherburne and his son, Donald, were nabbed on Route 7 in
Corinna in May 1988 with 19 salmon _ 15 over the limit. They were
convicted in Penobscot County Superior Court and fined $325 each.
   The Sherburnes challenged the legality of a Maine Warden Service
roadblock, in which authorities stopped motorists and searched the
belongings of those who acknowledged they had been fishing. The
Sherburnes contended on appeal that the fact they had gone fishing
did not give authorities probable cause for a search.
   They called the stop a violation of their constitutional rights,
but the Maine Supreme Judicial Court rejected their appeal in a 5-1
vote.
   Justice Robert W. Clifford, writing for the majority, agreed
with the trial court that the roadblock was conducted reasonably.
He said the state's interest in preserving game and fish outweighed
the intrusion on motorists who were stopped and fishermen who were
searched.
   The dissent came from Justice Caroline D. Glassman, who accused
the majority of ``a faulty analysis'' of constitutional law. Ms.
Glassman said catching a few fishing violations did not warrant the
use of the roadblock.
   The Sherburnes' attorney, Robert E. Sandy Jr. of Waterville,
said late Friday afternoon that he and his clients accepted the
court's decision.
   ``We have been given a full and fair hearing before the highest
court in the state,'' Sandy said. ``We lost the decision.''

   A bipartisan commission recommended an
ambitious $66 billion plan today to provide health insurance and
long-term care to nearly all Americans. It immediately drew
criticism from Congress and some of its own members for failing to
recommend a way to pay for it.
   The U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care
reported it had approved proposals to provide universal health
insurance, phased in over five years, and a proposal to ensure
long-term nursing care to Americans.
   The panel voted 8-7 on the insurance plan and 11-4 on the plan
for long-term care.
   ``We can't offer easy answers, but we can offer a challenge to
this country,'' said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., chairman of the
panel. It was known as the Pepper Commission for its first
chairman, the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.

   The government is forcing airlines to open the
skies to the handicapped, but says blind people still can't sit
near the exit door.
   Transportation Department rules requiring more accommodations
for the disabled on airliners brought immediate criticism from an
airline industry trade group and from a national organization of
blind people. Both said they were considering lawsuits.
   The rules call for moveable aisle armrests and more space for
wheelchairs and require airlines to make other provisions for
handicapped travelers.
   Billed as an anti-discrimination measure required by Congress,
the rules will cost airlines an estimated $400 million over the
next 20 years _ for training personnel and modifying airliner
interior design to accommodate more disabled people, said Don
Trilling, DOT director for regulatory affairs.

   City leaders had hoped a street named
after slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. would foster
feelings of hope and pride, but now they worry the backlash will
sully Portland's image.
   The street name has been met with an organized opposition led by
a conservative political veteran. A white supremacist leader joined
the opponents, and they collected 52,435 signatures on a ballot
initiative to reverse the name change.
   A judge nixed their drive on Wednesday, but the opponents
appealed Friday with the Oregon Supreme Court in hopes of meeting a
March 15 deadline to put the initiative on the May 15 primary
ballot.
   A civic leader says that the controversy, combined with the 1988
beating death of an Ethiopian immigrant by a group of neo-Nazi
``skinheads,'' may give blacks second thoughts about moving to the
city. Three men have received long prison sentences for the beating
death.

   President Bush's nominee for the nation's top

   Former New York state Sen. John R. Dunne has 400 shares of

   Schlumberger, a New York-based company engaged in oil field

South Africa, according to Alison Cooper, a spokeswoman for

   Thousands of mostly poor young women
took out guaranteed student loans for a correspondence school they
thought would train them for glamorous careers as travel agents.
   But only 20 percent of the 60,000 students at the American
Career Training School graduated, and 90 percent were saddled with
hefty loan bills for classes some said were nearly worthless, U.S.
Senate investigators have found.
   The school, meanwhile, profited from $150 million in loans and
the owners became overnight millionaires, said the investigators,
who this week accused ACT of fraud in the first of a series of
hearings on problems in the federal student loan system.
   ``It's just too much money being unaccounted for,'' said Grace
T. McPhearson, investigator for the Senate Permanent Investigations

   It would be a lot easier to understand the state
of the U.S. economy right now if things like the weather didn't
keep blurring the picture.
   For the past few months, nearly all the statistical information
on economic activity has come out amid a chorus of qualifications.
   Analysts said the numbers for December showed misleading
strength in industrial production, for example, because frigid
temperatures in much of the country swelled demand for heat and
electrical power.
   In January, it was reported, retail sales figures were
artificially inflated by a sudden swing to above-normal warmth that
drew shoppers out of their homes.
   Thus, by the time a 1.1 percent upsurge in the consumer price
index for January was announced a few weeks ago, numerous
explanations had been prepared to show why it shouldn't worry
anyone.
   If you excluded food and energy costs _ which are said to be
especially prone to deceptive short-term fluctuations _ the CPI was
up a less threatening 0.6 percent.
   To those who still found the latter figure disturbing, observers
cited further special influences, including an increase in public
transportation fares in the New York City area.
   The idea of screening out supposedly aberrant influences makes
sense in principle. After all, analysts who study the numbers are
looking for trends of lasting significance. When you are watching
for changes in the tide, you don't want to be distracted by
individual waves.
   Still, there may be limits to how many asterisks and footnotes
an average citizen might accept.
   Veteran riders of the New York City subways, for instance, will
have trouble swallowing the idea that what they encountered at the
start of 1990 was a ``one-time'' fare increase.
   Twenty-five years ago, they recall, a trip cost 15 cents. Now it
is $1.15.
   Similarly, consumers might balk at the idea that their actual
experience with inflation is better portrayed if you don't count
the cost of feeding their families or driving their cars.
   ``Inflation is a general rise in the price level,'' says Paul
Boltz, financial economist at the investment management firm of T.
Rowe Price Associates. ``It can occur even while prices of some
goods are falling.
   ``Likewise, prices of some goods can rise more rapidly than the
general inflation rate, but subtracting them out of the inflation
measure does not lower inflation.''
   The idea that the weather has somehow been abornally wild and
wacky this winter also is suspect. True, temperatures have
fluctuated widely day by day and week by week from their historical
averages. But those things tend to even out.
   As of early this month, cumulative degree-day counts for the
season in the Northeast were running very close to those of last
winter at the same time, and to ``normal'' levels calculated by
meteorologists.
   Many economic observers hold out the hope that a better fix on
the economy will be available soon, now that winter is almost over.
But evidently those bets are off if we have some sort of
``unusual'' spring.

<HEAD>Inflation in Peru: What Once Bought a Truck Now Buys Cigarettes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSE GONZALES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Their currency is named for the sun, but with
inflation of nearly 3,000 percent last year, Peruvians got little
warmth from it.
   ``The first truck I bought, 15 years ago, cost me 10 million
soles; now that won't even buy me a pack of cigarettes,'' said
Miguel Guzman, who owns a trucking company in Lima.
   Guzman quoted prices in the old currency, the sol _ Spanish for
sun.
   In 1986, when the sol had fallen to 14,000 to the dollar, the
government lopped off three zeros and renamed it the inti _ sun in
Quechua, the Indian language spoken by nearly half the population.
   Four years later, a dollar buys 14,000 intis, which means it
would buy 14 million soles if they were still around.
   To Peruvians, like nearly everyone else, jokes are spiritual
life preservers against disaster. The latest one in Lima is that
the government will chop off three zeros again and call its money
the lupaca _ sun in Aymara, Peru's second major Indian language.
   The inflation rate for the past year, which meant prices ended
the year 30 times higher on average than 12 months earlier, was
surpassed only by Argentina's 4,924 percent.
   Doris Mandujano, 27, one of three daughters in a working-class
family of 16, including grandchildren, says the last year has
brought fundamental changes in the way they live.
   ``Sometimes at dinner there isn't enough food to go around,''
she said. ``We used to have milk and marmalade for breakfast; now
it's bread and oatmeal. ``We've given up trying to provide clothing
and medicine for everyone.''
   Her family is squeezed into a three-bedroom, cement-block house
Miss Mandujano's father built in Villa El Salvador, a shantytown on
the outskirts of Lima.
   Miss Mandujano's parents and seven of the children, including
herself, have jobs and contribute to meeting the family's needs.
She has the additional job of trying to make and follow a budget.
   ``Our pay doesn't keep up with prices,'' she said. ``Sometimes
by the fourth day of the month, we've already spent what was
budgeted for two weeks, and so the crisis begins.''
   Most economists blame government policies that favored
consumption over production while creating a huge deficit that fed
inflation.
   They say populist President Alan Garcia's administration has
subsidized basic goods and services to the point of bankrupting the
very state companies that provide the services.
   A gallon of gasoline costs the equivalent of only 40 cents, but
the state oil company, Petroperu, is on the verge of bankruptcy.
   Electricity and water are among the world's cheapest, but both
are rationed to Lima's 7 milliion people, largely because of the
dilapidated systems. Some parts of the city have been without water
for weeks.
   Ernesto Amans, president of the state water company, said nearly
half the water leaving treatment plants was lost through leaking
underground mains and the company could not afford the $18 million
needed for repairs.
   While subsidized prices remain low, food and clothing rose more
than 2,500 percent last year, entertainment soared more than 10,000
percent and education nearly 20,000 percent, according to official
statistics.
   The magazine Analisis Laboral predicts that by the time Garcia
leaves office July 28, accumulated inflation during his five-year
term will reach 1,383,120 percent.
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is favored to win the April 8
presidential election as the candidate of a center-right coalition.
He has pledged to reduce annual inflation to 10 percent within a
year, but says it will demand great sacrifice.
   After five years of Garcia, who campaigned as ``the president of
hope'' and won by a landslide, many Peruvians are skeptical of
politicians' promises.
   ``All that's left to believe in is ourselves,'' Miss Mandujano
said.

ozone layer that protects the Earth against the sun's damaging
ultraviolet rays.
   Until last year, the clear skies over IBM's circuit board plant
in Endicott in south-central New York belied the plant's identity
as one of the largest users of ozone-depleting chemicals in the
United States, releasing more than 2 million pounds of the
invisible chemicals annually from its white steel pipes.
   But in January, International Business Machines Corp. announced
that after spending millions of dollars and years of research, the
plant's emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals had been reduced
almost 75 percent.
   In the face of growing evidence that industrial chemicals are
eroding the ozone that filters ultraviolet rays, IBM is one of a
number of American companies slowly beginning to change the way
they do business.
   The destructive effects on the ozone caused by
chlorofluorocarbons, used as refrigerants, cleaning solvents and to
make bubbles in plastic foam, have been known for more than a
decade.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered a 50 percent
reduction in the use of CFCs by the end of the century, and many
companies have set earlier deadlines or pledged to phase them out
altogether.
   But according to the National Resources Defense Council,
emissions of two chemicals that are as yet unregulated _ methyl
chloroform and carbon tetrachloride _ together account for 33
percent of the man-made, ozone-destroying chlorine in the
stratosphere.
   As long as they are used, the ozone will be unable to recover
even if CFCs are phased out entirely, the Washington-based
environmental interest group says.
   Spokeswoman Deborah Sheiman said the group is particularly
concerned about methyl chloroform, a chemical used primarily as a
metal cleaner and degreaser, which has not been widely acknowledged
as a threat to the ozone.
   ``Most of the attention has been on the CFCs,'' Sheiman said.
``We're hoping to turn that around. We believe that methyl
chloroform has got to be controlled if we're going to repair the
damage to the ozone hole.''
   Although about 200 companies reported reduced methyl chloroform
emissions in 1988 _ the latest year for which figures are available
_ almost as many increased emissions, Sheiman said.
   At IBM's vast 88-building complex in Endicott, the company uses
methyl chloroform in production of computer circuit boards.
   In 1987 and 1988, the plant emitted more than 1 million pounds
of methyl chloroform, about 2 percent of the total amount of the
chemical used at the plant, environmental engineering manager
Dennis F. Whittaker said.
   Last year, IBM substituted a water-based solvent for methyl
chloroform in one production line, resulting in an 89 percent
reduction in methyl chloroform emissions, down to 121,000 pounds,
Whittaker said.
   The new process, which IBM is implementing at plants in Texas,
Japan and West Germany, was developed after more than five years'
collaboration between IBM engineers and suppliers, Whittaker said.
He estimated the cost of research, development and engineering
changes at about $40 million.
   ``It takes a long time and it's a tremendous investment,'' he
said. ``It's not something you do to improve your profit line.''
   Methyl chloroform still is used in the company's advanced
technology line, where more complex boards for mainframe computers
are produced. IBM has not found a substitute precise enough to use
in that process, Whittaker said.
   ``We're working on it,'' he said. ``We need a breakthrough. It's
hard to schedule an invention.''
   Pratt &amp; Whitney of East Hartford, Conn., reported the highest
methyl chloroform emissions in the country in 1987. The aircraft
engine manufacturer has committed to reducing those levels by 80
percent to 90 percent in the next four years by switching to
alkaline cleaners, spokeswoman Peggy Kay said.
   The company's emissions already dropped by more than 75 percent
in 1988, she said.
   But Kay said it takes years of testing to ensure that changes
made in the company's manufacturing processes do not hurt the
product.
   ``You have to make sure that you're producing the same
quality,'' she said. ``If not, then it's not worth it. You want
safe aircraft engines.''
   Companies switching to environmentally safer alternatives find
they do not always work as well as methyl chloroform.
   The Johnson Controls plant in Watertown, Wis., has replaced
methyl chloroform with a petroleum-based solvent, plant engineer
Russell Miller said.
   ``I've gotten lots of complaints,'' he said. Methyl chloroform
``is a very good solvent, but it's very environmentally wrong,'' he
said.
   At the Fischer Controls International plant in Marshalltown,
Iowa, alkaline washers are replacing methyl chloroform as a
degreaser, said Ron Allen, the plant's director of loss prevention.
   The new washers are more expensive and difficult to use, but
``much friendlier to the environment,'' Allen said.
   ``We are optimistic that we can make alkaline washers work as
well,'' he said. ``We have a strong formal commitment to the
environment, and we feel we need to be pacesetters for our
customers.''
   The National Resources Defense Council wants to see laws banning
the use of methyl chloroform, but in the meantime, public pressure
is pushing some companies to begin voluntarily reducing emissions
of ozone-depleting chemicals, Sheiman said.
   ``I think it's having an impact,'' she said. ``That so many
companies have come forth with these pledges ... it certainly has
seemed to resonate in corporate boardrooms.''

   Like many residents, auto parts dealer
Jose Chavez has developed a fear of teen-agers in his crime-plagued
colonia near the South Texas border.
   His advice for visitors: ``If you stop there at nighttime and
you see a bunch of kids, you better not stop.''
   They might be Tri-City Bombers, a youth gang claiming Lopezville
as its territory. Other gangs roam many of Hidalgo County's rural
colonias, the scores of impoverished subdivisions where migrant
farm workers live along unpaved streets without adequate water,
sewers or drainage.
   In this farming region separated from the rest of the country by
huge ranches, people wonder how they ended up with a social problem
considered symptomatic of big-city angst and alienation.
   How did they get an ``asphalt jungle'' in a place where the
streets aren't even paved?
   Officials say the Lower Rio Grande Valley's gangs remain
relatively unsophisticated. Yet, just as in Los Angeles, Chicago
and other cities, they steal, fight and attack enemies' windows
with rocks and bullets.
   Sometimes, they kill. In January, a gunfight between what police
said were rival gang members left two young men dead in the town of
San Juan.
   It is the despair of poverty, some say, that leads to gang
membership, along with a high school dropout rate that hovers
around 50 percent.
   ``Kids are real bored, man,'' said Gabriel Benavides, a
17-year-old still in school who has been named by the Hildago
County Sheriff's Department as a Tri-City Bombers leader.
   The gang, which claims about 200 members, is named for the
cities of Pharr, San Juan and Alamo, which share a school district.
The spray-painted ``TCB'' initials show up everywhere in Lopezville.
   ``It's like having an outside family. We're all brothers,''
Benavides said, putting his fist on his heart with the index and
pinky fingers extended _ the TCB salute.
   They don't like to fight, he said, but cautioned: ``I have a
tendency to cause pain. If you give me trouble, I have a tendency
to cause pain. If you don't mess with me, I won't give you pain.''
   TCB member Jorge Alberto Cantu, 20, remains in jail without
bond, accused in the shooting deaths of two males who authorities
said belonged to a gang called the Spoilers. TCB members confronted
a group of Spoilers outside a San Juan video arcade the night of
Jan. 5, said Police Chief Rene Lizcano.
   Parents of the victims, 14-year-old Guadalupe Gonzalez Jr. and
his 21-year-old cousin, Miguel Ojeda, said neither belonged to a
gang.
   ``He was going to get married a week later,'' Oralia Ojeda said
of her son.
   Chavez gave up on keeping glass in the windows at his small
store, Joe's Auto Parts. Gang members would throw rocks through
them in revenge every time he painted over the graffiti they
sprayed on his storefront, he said. Now, the windows are covered
with heavy sheets of plywood.
   One night, a brick sailed through the front window of Chavez's
house and hit his wife in the head, he said. Another day, someone
fired shots into the cab of his truck.
   ``A lot of these people, they don't say nothing because they're
afraid these kids will come and do something at their house at
night while they're asleep,'' Chavez said.
   Two years ago, five area gang members were convicted of beating
a 27-year-old man to death with a baseball bat outside a
convenience store. They left his 33-year-old brother with permanent
brain damage, said Chief Deputy Bob Davis of the sheriff's
department.
   ``Apparently, it wasn't over anything,'' Davis said. ``These
guys were on their turf.''
   Davis estimates about 25 gangs operate in the county's rural
areas, covered by only seven patrol cars. Gang members smashed the
windows out of four patrol cars in a melee last Halloween.
   Some residents say the gangs have been around for nearly a
decade but drew authorities' attention only after the cars were
attacked.
   The developments worry J. Michael Olivero, a criminal justice
professor at the University of Texas-Pan American in Edinburg.
   Olivero, who studied gangs in the Chicago area, believes the
South Texas groups could become sophisticated crime rings involved
in extortion, drug trafficking and other crimes typical of urban
gangs.
   ``They found a kid with an Uzi,'' Olivero said. ``The things
aren't cheap.''
   Graffiti representing California and Illinois gangs has started
appearing on area walls, which Olivero said could result from
children of migrant farm families traveling to other states.
   Community leaders have been meeting recently to address the gang
problem, and say parks and jobs would help kids stay out of trouble.
   School officials, meanwhile, have promised a late afternoon bus
route to give students in outlying areas a chance to participate in
extracurricular activities.
   Chris Willingham, head counselor at the local high school, said
the transient lives of migrant farm workers keep many children
off-balance at school. Many arrive late in the year and leave
early, she said.
   ``We're going to have to address the educational needs of these
kids,'' Olivero said, ``and we're going to have to get them water
and get them roads and things like that to facilitate a sense of
pride. Kids who are integrated with family, church and school don't
join gangs.''
   But while Lizcano, the San Juan police chief, acknowledges the
county has a problem, he rejects the theory that gangs are fostered
by poverty and hopelessness.
   ``I grew up in a colonia myself,'' he said, ``and I'm a chief of
police.''

<TEXT>
   Joe Cimino and Willie Hoskins put on
red union T-shirts last March 4 and joined the thousands of
machinists outside Eastern Airlines during the first hours of the
strike against the carrier.
   They chanted the same protest cries. They rattled the chain-link
gates near Eastern hangars.
   Today, Cimino and two other striking Eastern machinists are
building up an automotive repair business. Hoskins has applied for
a $5-an-hour job as a security guard so he can get health insurance
to pay for dentures.
   ``When we went out on strike, it's like someone pulled the rug
out from under you,'' said Cimino, who pooled $10,000 with the
other workers to open the garage north of Miami. ``You can either
stay down or get up. I'm union all the way, but you have to pay the
bills,''
   ``The last day I worked was my last day at Eastern,'' said
Hoskins, a 34-year Eastern veteran who lived on his $400-a-month
strike benefits and life insurance money from his late mother.
   For many of the 9,000 Eastern machinists who walked off the job
with raised fists and high hopes, the past year has been a test of
self-preservation and a lesson in the squeeze of a slowing national
economy.
   Some have found work at other airlines. Others took jobs where
they could: restaurants, factories, air freight companies. Few make
the $19.99 an hour top-scale pay they were earning at Eastern.
   Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy court filing locked up thousands
of dollars many machinists had saved under a vacation-time
reimbursement plan. Health insurance bills keep coming in.
   ``Some people have landed on their feet, but there have also
been some real sad stories,'' said Machinist union local vice
president Frank Ortis, who estimates at least a dozen suicides and
many more divorces have occurred among the union ranks since the
strike.
   Wage and work force reductions since the strike at Eastern _
once one of Florida's largest employers _ have had at least a $1
billion economic impact, said William O. Cullom, president of the
Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce.
   Since the strike, Miami-based Eastern has shifted most of its
hub operations to Atlanta. Miami accounts for less than 50 of the
total daily flights of 800, airline spokesman Robert Hunter said.
   Before the strike, Eastern ran about 1,100 flights a day with
about 28,000 employees. Now, the airline has about 20,000
employees, about half hired since the strike started.
   Very few of the pilots and flight attendants were able to return
to Eastern when they called off their sympathy strike last fall.
   But the decline of Eastern in Miami has been compensated by the
expansion by other carriers such as American Airlines and Pan
American World Airways, which are battling over Eastern's Latin
American routes.
   ``For the airport and the community as a whole, the strike's
impact has been small. It's the individuals that are going through
hell, in some cases,'' said Nicholas Glaskowsky, an economics
professor at the University of Miami.
   For the 12,000 residents of Miami Springs near the airport, the
strike has not been the economic menace predicted last spring.
   Fred White, a 24-year barber and part-time real estate agent,
said a few Eastern workers moved out, but their homes quickly were
purchased by newcomers.
   ``This town no longer lives or dies on what happens at
Eastern,'' he said. ``Life goes on.''
   Even at the Machinists local headquarters, reality is replacing
rhetoric.
   There still are many handwritten placards urging unity and
attacking Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern Airlines' parent, Texas
Air Corp. But most attention goes to reports of job openings, some
as away far as Los Angeles, Denver and Honolulu.
   ``You can't be unrealistic and believe that people aren't going
to take a job if they need it and leave town,'' said Ortis.
   Last month while in Miami, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said
there were no victors in the Eastern strike, since labor has not
forced the sale of the carrier and management still is burdened by
losses. Last year, Texas Air reported a loss of $885.6 million, the
largest ever by a U.S. airline.
   But few strikers express regrets, saying the strike has
strengthened the organized labor movement.
   ``We all knew what we were walking away from when we left
Eastern: security and good pay. For good or bad, thousands of lives
were affected by that decision. I'm still convinced it was the
right one,'' said Bob Young, a partner with Cimino and striker
Frank Weiss at the Pembroke Pines automotive shop.
   Last month, striker Vincent Parlatore had his day in court. A
small-claims court judge, however, rejected his claim for $1,580 in
back wages.
   It was another disappointment in a belt-tightening year.
Parlatore peddled telephone books shortly after the strike and got
extra hours as a policeman in a seaside town near Fort Lauderdale.
   His pay at an air cargo company in Miami is $13.25 an hour,
about two-thirds what he made at Eastern.
   ``We're not out begging, but life's not as easy as it was,''
Parlatore said. ``If it's not a necessity, we don't buy it. We
don't go out to eat. We can't go to movies.''
   Parlatore has applied for an inspector's job with the Federal
Aviation Administration. If hired, he might be forced to move.
   ``What can you do?'' he said. ``That's one less person on the
picket line.''

   The chaotic development that is gobbling up the
Amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan
developed by officials of Amazon countries and leading scientists
from around the world.
   ``That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain
forest in recent years,'' said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist
at the Smithsonian Institution and an Amazon specialist.
   ``It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing
to read about conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil,
except bad news,'' Lovejoy said in a recent interview.
   Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain
forest, lies in Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight
surrounding countries.
   Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in
mid-January in Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people
in the heart of the Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's
once-thriving rubber trade.
   The workshop, which brought together all the governments and
scientists with interests in the rain forest, culminated with a
plan to regulate development in up to 80 percent of the Amazon
region.
   It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon
had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation
priorities, the meeting's participants said.
   The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has
broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for
national conservation programs, participants said.
   Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called
multiple-use development, which preserves the forest while allowing
tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and
medicinal plants.
   Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by
developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle
ranching or farming, has been ambivalent about the need to conserve
the Amazon.
   Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the
setting of priorities was ``all done with the blessing of Brazil,''
Lovejoy said.
   Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands
of plant and animal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30 percent
of the world's plant and animal species.
   One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken
from the deep shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants
representing 50 species.
   Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives
without ever setting foot on the ground. One group of orchid
species grows only near the top of the canopy; an entirely
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom.
   At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small
groups to assess conservation priorities.
   Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators.
Mammologists took inventory of the Amazon's screeching monkeys.
Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats
fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same.
   Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the
Amazon. When they were done, the areas determined to be worth
saving covered 70 percent to 80 percent of the Amazon.
   ``The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no
way of getting around that,'' said Russell Mittermeier, president
of Conservation International and an authority on endangered
monkeys.
   Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves, along
with multiple-use areas where some development could occur.
   It is not realistic to build a fence around 70 percent to 80
percent of the Amazon, he said. Only the most critical areas should
be placed off limits to development.
   ``Ten to 20 percent of the entire Amazon should be in protected
parks or preserves, ideally,'' he said. At present, 2 percent of
the Amazon is protected.
   Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan.
   ``The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards
the work that has got to be done,'' said Stanley Malone, director
of the Suriname Forest Service.
   Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978
to develop a unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone
said. What the officials lacked, however, was a guide to which
areas most needed protection.
   That determination has now been made, based on the number of
different species a given area contained, and on how many of those
species were endemic, or unique, to the area.
   ``Now we'll have to see what develops from this,'' Mittermeier
said. A new Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, will be
inaugurated March 15, and with him will come a new Brazilian
environmental policy.
   Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is
uncertain. ``As always, everything depends on key individuals,''
Mittermeier said.
   ``I'm basically always optimistic,'' he said. ``I feel sure that
we can develop appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of
work.''

<HEAD>The Audi V8 Quattro</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 Audi V8 Quattro is as close to a swagger as the folks
at Audi get.
   This $47,450 power machine is quietly packaged in decidedly Audi
styling _ the luxury Eurosedan look that's relatively unassuming.
   But take this new flagship of the Audi fleet out on the highway
and revel with Audi in a new appreciation for what a luxury
Eurosedan can be.
   The Audi V8 Quattro test car's 3.6-liter, 32-valve V-8 engine
impressively dominated, going from 0 to 60 mph in 8.7 seconds, and
is capable of producing 240 horsepower. Coupled with four-speed
electronically controlled automatic transmission, it delivered
smooth performance, especially in the economy driving mode.
   Drivers can change the shift points with a knob on the center
console, depending on whether they want to watch fuel consumption
(economy mode) or want maximum power (sport setting). I preferred
the sport setting, though it made this nearly 4,000-pound car so
quick I nearly took off the corner bumpers of a couple of cars I
was trying to pass.
   And road handling? The Audi V8's suspension was masterful,
making the vehicle feel as safe and in control at, let's just say,
frightfully high speeds, as it did at the highway speed limit of 65
mph. And with full-time four-wheel-drive, this car can handle just
about anything. It tackled snow with gusto, leaving other cars in a
swirl of white. It tracked capably through icy slush, too.
   It was especially impressive, considering this is Audi's first
merging of a powerful 32-valve V-8 engine, an automatic
transmission and permanent all-wheel-drive technology. Of course,
it's also the most expensive car the West German carmaker has
marketed in the States. The previous top-priced Audi was the 200
Quattro wagon at $38,000.
   But wait. There's more to the Audi V8 Quattro. A microcomputer
not only monitors the engine systems and maintains optimum
performance but memorizes malfunctions for easier diagnosis at the
shop.
   The test car's antilock brakes (ABS) came with a turnoff button
on the dashboard for those driving conditions, such as loose
gravel, where ABS can sometimes hinder a driver's ability to stop
by preventing gravel from building up at the wheels.
   The Audi Bose sound system was superb, and the electronically
controlled front seats _ leather, of course _ were roomy and
comfortable. The front center armrest, which housed a cellular
phone that was standard equipment, not optional, could be adjusted
to various heights.
   Other thoughtful touches included heated seats in both the front
and rear that worked wonderfully fast, a heated door lock on the
driver door so you can't be frozen out of the car, and a dual
windshield washer system. The system lets you use a special washer
fluid that's particularly effective for salt and grime first, and
then follow up with the regular fluid for picture-perfect vision no
matter what the road throws up at you. The headlights received a
washing, too, each time the regular washer fluid was activated.
   The front floor mats had fasteners to keep them in place,
carpeting was all-wool throughout, and the shoulder belt height was
adjustable so the belt wouldn't chafe against a short person's neck.
   There also was a reddish light that shone down on the driver
floor area as an added safety feature when the headlights were on,
wood grain tastefully swathed across the doors and dashboard, and a
spot in the center of the instrument cluster that showed what radio
station was tuned in so the driver never had to look below at the
radio.
   That feature took some getting used to. My eyes caught the
flickering of something changing in the instrument cluster, and at
first, I thought it must have been a warning light that came on and
went out. On examination, I realized it was just the changing radio
station.
   I also noted the car can guzzle down the fuel _ I averaged under
17 mpg in combined city-highway driving, with the EPA rating the
Audi V8 at 14 mpg in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. A gas
guzzler tax of $1,050, by the way, is added on to the $47,450 base
price for the Audi V8 Quattro because of the vehicle's poor fuel
economy.
   Additionally, the person sitting in the rear middle seat would
find the seatback a bit hard. That's where the rear center armrest
is, and it just doesn't make for a very comfortable long-term
resting spot. On the other hand, the rear legroom was good, and
both the rear window controls and rear cigarette lighter could be
disabled with the touch of a button on the driver door so children
in back can't get hurt.
   Audi lists some impressive competitors for the V8 Quattro _ the
Mercedes-Benz 420SEL, which starts around $63,000, the BMW 735i,
around $53,000, and the Jaguar XJ6 Vanden Plas, around $48,000.
Audi didn't mention Japanese luxury models, such as the Lexus
LS400, which starts at $35,000, but they're bound to be a factor,
too.
   Still, sales of the Audi V8 Quattro totaled more than 800 in
calendar 1989, and the company projects about 1,500 sales in 1990.
   They're looking for mostly male buyers between 35 and 49, with
household income of $150,000. They will be predominantly college
graduates in professional jobs, Audi said.
   Because the Audi V8 Quattro is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports
magazine does not list owner trouble reports.

   Nordstrom Inc., put on a pedestal for delivering
extraordinary service at its department stores, may have had an
unfair advantage over the rivals that have long looked up to the
retailer.
   Some of the smiling salesmen and women known for writing
personal thank-you notes to customers and going to unusual lengths
to satisfy shoppers apparently have been scowling inside. Outsiders
who saw a happy family of ``Nordies'' now are learning they may
have gotten the wrong impression.
   The Seattle-based department store owner virtually admitted this
past week that employees hadn't been fully paid for providing the
impeccable service that has made Nordstrom famous.
   The company said it created a $15 million reserve for back-pay
claims, a provision that eroded fourth-quarter earnings.
   For the quarter ended Jan. 31, earnings tumbled 34 percent to
$31.4 million or 39 cents a share, from $47.5 million or 58 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 12 percent to $857.5 million in
the quarter from $765.1 million.
   Much of the drop in quarterly earnings reflected higher
merchandise markdowns to keep up with price-cutting competitors.
   Accusations have come to light that Nordstrom pressures its
employees into performing tasks on their own time.
   The Washington state Department of Labor and Industry ruled last
month that Nordstrom had a pattern of making sales clerks work
during off-hours without compensation and ordered the company to
pay them for uncompensated hours. Employees sometimes bring
merchandise to customers' homes, thank them in writing for shopping
at Nordstrom and do other good retailing deeds.
   Making matters worse, Nordstrom has been hit with two
class-action lawsuits, one filed by three shareholders claiming
they and others who own company stock suffered financial losses
because Nordstrom officers failed to disclose the labor problems.
   Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail consultant, says now that
Nordstrom's dark secret is attracting national attention
competitors may feel less inclined to emulate the company.
   By not paying fully for the work it got out of employees, a
company its competitors considered the epitome of retailing
excellence actually had an unfair advantage.
   ``Their competitors have been under tremendous pressure to
render the kind of service that Nordstrom has been so famous for,''
he said. ``The question now arises: Will they be able to render the
same type of service if they have to pay for it? Will other stores
still be so eager to follow suit?''
   Even before Nordstrom's dirty laundry began being aired in
public, the company's stock had been taking a beating. The stock,
40 percent owned by the founding Nordstrom family, has slumped
about 35 percent since reaching a high of $42.50 a share over the
summer. It was trading around $27 last week.
   Some analysts pooh-pooh the idea that the bad publicity over
Nordstrom's labor practices will cause lasting damage to a stock
with heaps of potential.
   Richard Pyle, of the investment firm Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood
Inc., says now is an ideal time to invest in Nordstrom.
   ``We're comfortable recommending the stock as a buy for people
looking to own a long-term growth company,'' Pyle said. ``The only
time you get to buy this company cheaply is when it's in the midst
of a mini-crisis.''
   A severe case of inventory bloat in 1984 and the stock market
crash in October 1987 provided two earlier buying opportunities, he
said.
   The traits that he admires in Nordstrom haven't been altered.
The company is a savvy fashion merchandiser and produces sales of
more than $400 a square foot _ roughly double the volume of its
competitors.
   Pyle predicts the labor issue will be resolved satisfactorily.
In any case, not all ``Nordies'' are negative on the company as a
support rally at the company's flagship Seattle store last Thursday
attested.
   Nordstrom has 60 stores in Washington, Oregon, California,
Alaska, Virginia and Utah. It plans 16 more, with expansion into
Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, Minnesota, Indiana, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New York.
   ``There are a lot of employees out there who are supportive of
how Nordstrom runs its business,'' said Pyle, adding that there are
plenty of real estate developers all over the country with space on
their hands who would love to fill it with a Nordstrom store.

<HEAD>Corporations Don't Seem Bearish on Rates, Judging by Their
Borrowing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite all the dark forecasts that surging
interest rates in Japan and West Germany will drive U.S. rates up,
American corporations dependent on borrowed money show little sign
of worry.
   Indeed, if their propensity to borrow is a good indicator, it
appears that many companies regard the recent upturn in U.S. rates
to be temporary and not the beginning of an upward worldwide spiral.
   That would be good news for the credit markets, which have been
gripped in recent weeks by fears about foreign demand for U.S.
Treasury bonds and the sorry state of the junk bond market.
   In the first two months of this year, borrowers issued a total
of $9.7 billion in investment-grade bonds in the public market,
according to Moody's Investors Service. That amounts to an
annualized rate of just under $60 billion, a drop of more than 22
percent from the 1989 total of $77.8 billion.
   What's more, this year's total has been inflated by more issues
from foreign borrowers such as the Canadian province of Nova
Scotia, which offered $300 million of 30-year bonds this past week.
   ``The surprising upturn in long-term bond yields in early 1990
definitely has discouraged a significant amount of investment-grade
corporate bond issuance,'' says John Lonski, senior economist at
Moody's.
   ``Many a corporate treasurer perhaps still expects long-term
bond yields to decline later in the year,'' he said.
   While corporations have been abstaining from the bond market,
they have been actively peddling IOUs in short-term markets where
rates haven't risen as much. The total amount of commercial paper
outstanding issued by non-financial companies was $136.5 billion as
of Feb. 21, a jump of $8.31 billion since the start of the year.
   Seth Waugh, managing director in charge of corporate bond
trading and new issues at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said most Wall
Street bankers had thought rates would stay low and bond business
would boom in the first quarter.
   Instead, rates have risen because of a spurt in inflation, a
belief that the economy is on the mend and fears of more intense
competition for global investment funds from Japan and West Germany.
   The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond has risen
from a December low of near 7.8 percent to around 8.6 percent
currently.
   Waugh says a pickup in new issues in the past two weeks shows
some corporations want to lock in current rates to guard against an
increase, even though many others are content to wait. A
quarter-point move in interest rates would produce a rush of
borrowings, he predicts, motivated by fear if rates go up or by the
cheaper cost of funds if rates go down.
   `It's a pretty divided camp right now,'' he says.
   Analysts say it's far too soon to read anything deeper into the
decline in borrowings. Nevertheless, Lonski says there are several
reasons to suspect that corporate activity might stay subdued.
   The sluggish economy has slowed growth in capital spending,
reducing companies' borrowing needs, he says. Also, the collapse of
the junk bond market as a source of takeover financing has taken
some pressure off corporate managers, he says.
   ``There is less of a need to leverage the balance sheet in order
to boost your stock price,'' he says.
   If that's true, it would mark a stark change from the debt-happy
1980s. Moody's estimates net interest costs amounted to 42 percent
of operating earnings for non-financial companies in last year's
third quarter, up from 35 percent in 1988 and an average of 20
percent from 1972 to 1982.
   The rise in debt service largely reflected the explosive growth
of the junk market. Today, that market is extremely sluggish thanks
to the collapse of junk prices and of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
Only $700 million in junk bonds have been issued so far this year,
vs. more than $32 billion in all 1988.
   A treasurer for the financing arm of one of the nation's biggest
companies says junk bond woes have turned investors off from even
top-grade corporate bonds, making it difficult to borrow. This
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wall Street's
preoccupation with its internal problems also is to blame for the
slump in borrowings.
   ``I don't think the investment bankers in this country with
their problems are as aggressive or as innovative or as ready to
put their capital behind transactions,'' he said.

   A man is suing Donald Trump, saying the
billionaire businessman swiped his idea for the board game ``Trump:
The Game.''
   Walter Brockington III, a 29-year-old insurance man, filed the
lawsuit Thursday in U.S. District Court.
   Brockington, who's seeking more than $50,000 in damages, said he
sent a prototype of a board game he calls ``Mogul'' to Trump and
other big shooters, such as Alfred Taubman, Ted Turner and the late
Malcolm Forbes.
   Shortly afterward, Trump and game maker Milton Bradley signed a
deal to sell ``Trump: The Game'' for $25, with profits going to
charity.
   ``I don't think Trump did it for greed,'' said Brockington's
attorney, Susan Winshall. ``He turned the idea into a publicity
stunt.''
   Milton Goldfine, general counsel for the Trump organization,
said the lawsuit ``is completely without merit.''

<TEXT>
   Bulls took the driver's seat on Wall Street this
past week despite a shaky Tokyo market and a slew of divergent
economic signals.
   Tokyo's problems actually helped improve the attitude toward
U.S. stocks, while investors decided America's economic pluses now
outweigh the minuses.
   ``We're not quite as bad as we had been viewed six months ago
... at the same time things aren't quite as good everywhere else,''
said Thomas Czech, chairman of the investment committee at Blunt
Ellis &amp; Loewi Inc. in Milwaukee.
   Everywhere else mainly means Japan. The Tokyo stock markethas
been on a slide, which intensifed Monday with its second-largest
point loss ever. A 4.5 percent drop extended the fall in the Nikkei
average of 225 Japanese stocks to around 14 percent since the start
of the year.
   To foreigners who for a long time have suspiciously eyed Tokyo's
high price-earnings ratios, the downturn came as no surprise.
   Some ratios of stock prices to company earnings there had
reached as high as 60 to 1, making Japanese stocks seem wildly
overvalued to buttoned-down U.S. investors accustomed to far more
conservative readings here.
   At least some of the money that has flowed out of Japanese
stocks has found a home in the United States.
   Hugh Johnson, senior vice president and chief investment officer
at First Albany Corp., in Albany, N.Y., said anecdotal evidence,
based on discussions with colleagues in the investment community,
suggests that U.S. investors have been pulling out of Japan. To
some extent, similar maneuvers are being carried out by Japanese
and West German money managers.
   ``This is the equity market's version of a flight to safety _
the safety of lower price-earnings ratios from the exposure of high
price-earnings ratios,'' he said.
   An indication that more capital is flowing in our direction was
that the dollar took flight on Friday, prompting various central
banks to sell dollars on world foreign-exchange markets to check
the currency's runup.
   The U.S. role as a safe haven was enhanced by reports that, on
balance, implied the economy might be doing better than some
gloom-and-doomers feared.
   A February survey of purchasing managers at the nation's
industrial corporations, issued Thursday, showed the slowdown in
the manufacturing sector eased. The National Association of
Purchasing Management's widely watched index rose to 48.3 percent
in February from 45.2 percent a month earlier.
   A reading below 50 means manufacturing is declining, but the
improvement from January was nonetheless encouraging.
   On Friday, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, designed to
foretell economic activity six to nine months ahead, showed no
change in January. The flat reading followed two months of
increase, but seemed to support ``the view that we're in a no-boom,
no-bust trajectory,'' Johnson of First Albany said.
   ``The message of the financial markets today is that we will
miss a recession,'' the analyst said.
   News on the leading indicators helped the stock market rally
Friday to extend its winning streak to five straight sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed at
2,660.36, climbing 24.77 on Friday which brought its gain for the
week to 96.17 points.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 5.62 to
184.97; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 11.50 to 431.02; and, the American Stock Exchange's market
value index rose 5.02 to 356.12.
   Big Board volume averaged 161.6 million shares a day, up from
159.84 million daily in the prior week.

<HEAD>Ordinance Introduced to Block Plant Shutdowns Due to Takeovers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An alderman is proposing an ordinance that would
allow the city to use its power of eminent domain to prevent the
shutdown of local manufacturing plants acquired in takeovers.
   The proposed law forcing businesses to sell under city order
would be the first of its kind in the nation, although critics say
it would amount to unconstitutional ``nationalization'' of
companies.
   ``What we trying to do is focus on corporate raiders buying
plants on the edge of going under,'' Alderman Bernard Hansen said
Friday. ``They say they are going to improve the plant and keep it
going, but instead they close them and take jobs to another
country.''
   Hansen said the proposed ordinance would protect jobs by giving
Chicago's economic development commissioner the right to invoke
eminent domain against the owner of a manufacturing plant that is
shutting down.
   Laws of eminent domain allow governments to seize property in
matters of public interest.
   Under the proposed ordinance, the city could force the sale of
the seized plant if a buyer had been found to keep the plant open
for business. The ordinance would apply to plants closing within
five years of takeover by a new owner.
   The proposal was drafted by a group called Business and
Professional People for the Public Interest on behalf of workers
and community groups fighting to keep open a plant operated by
Stewart-Warner Corp.
   The company, which makes electronics equipment, was purchased by
Britain's BTR PLC, which last year announced plans to shutter the
plant in 1991 and move manufacturing operations to Mexico.
   Hansen said there are potential buyers for the plant, but that
BTR refuses to sell.
   But critics say the ordinance would allow unwelcome intrusions
by the city into corporate affairs.
   ``This is a city equivalent of nationalizing a company,'' said
Sam Mitchell, executive director of the Chicago Association of
Commerce and Industry.
   ``I can understand motivation of the ordinance, to keep jobs in
the city. But I don't believe the city or any unit of government
have the right to step into and effectively nationalize a company
because they do something that doesn't please that government.''
   Hansen, who heads the Chicago City Council's Ecomonic
Development Committee, said a hearing on the proposed ordinance is
scheduled for later this month.
   Lester W. Brann, president of the Illinois State Chamber of
Commerce, calls the proposed ordinance a ``screwy idea.''
   ``The marketplace is going to determine where companies locate
and where they expand their plants,'' he said. ``They are going to
expand where the governments operate efficently, where incentives
are offered and taxes are low.''
   Brann said the proposed ordinance could impose a new burden on
taxpayers, and said companies taken over by the city could run into
problems before a new buyer is found.
   ``The City Council would be well advised to take a good hard
look at what the city is or isn't doing to encourage business
expansion,'' he said, adding that the proposal could be an
unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce.

<TEXT>
   A few days after his death, flamboyant
publishing tycoon Malcom S. Forbes is gracing the cover of the
biweekly magazine bearing his name.
   The cover of the March 19 issue, due on newsstands Monday, is
taken from a portrait painted about 10 years ago of Forbes wearing
a silver motorcycling jumpsuit seated in a chair with several
helmets at his feet.
   Forbes died of a heart attack last weekend at age 70.
   Motorcycling was one of Forbes' passions, along with hot air
ballooning and collecting Faberge eggs and toy soldiers. Several
Hell's Angels cyclists showed up for a memorial service for Forbes
held Thursday in New York.
   The painting used for the cover, by Claudio Bravo, hangs in the
lobby of the Forbes office building in midtown Manhattan.
   At the top of the magazine's cover is the phrase ``1919-1990:
While alive, he lived,'' which will be inscribed on Forbes'
tombstone. Forbes had directed that his body be cremated and the
ashes interred on Lauthala, his island in the South Pacific.
   Ten of the 212 pages in the latest issue of the magazine are
devoted to tributes to the unabashed capitalist.
   Forbes editor James W. Michaels said it wasn't ``terribly
difficult'' to redo the issue after Forbes' sudden death last
Saturday.
   ``We always keep a large bank of pages open til the last minute
anyhow,'' he said Friday. ``It's the type of thing that one could
do with any big story.''
   Still, Michaels conceded, the last-minute changes meant printers
had to be paid overtime and the issue closed a few hours late. It
was finished around 5 a.m. Wednesday rather than around midnight as
usual.
   Forbes' oldest son, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., known as Steve, who
has taken over as chairman and chief executive of the magazine and
the family-owned company and as editor in chief of Forbes, says in
a message to readers:
   ``There is no replacing my father, but I bring the same spirit
of dedication and joy to the job that he did. We will continue to
move ahead as he was doing.''
   The Fact and Comment section, where the elder Forbes used to
display his wit and breezy writing style, also was written in the
latest issue by son Steve. The tribute to his father is entitled
``A Matchless Man.''
   Former defense secretary Caspar Weinberger, the magazine's
publisher, also weighs in with a eulogy. There also is a spread of
photographs, including black-and-white shots of Forbes' family
dating to around 1930.
   ``It is a family company and the owner was just down the hall,''
Michaels said. ``There aren't many such publications left in the
world.''
   The editor wouldn't disclose what was swept off the cover by the
portrait of Forbes. ``We may use that story in the next issue,'' he
said.

<HEAD>France Plans Special Visas for Hong Kong Chinese</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France will grant special visas to Hong Kong
citizens working for French companies after the British colony
reverts to Chinese control in 1997, a government spokesman said
Friday.
   ``If they have a valid passport, we'll give them a visa,'' said
the spokesman, who asked not to be named.
   He said specific terms of the visas such as length, working
rights and the possibility of permanent immigration had not been
decided. The spokesman said the decision was not officials but was
agreed to in principal by a government committee.
   French enterprises in Hong Kong have asked President Francois
Mitterrand's government to act amid growing fear among their
employees over the pending takeover by Beijing, the spokesman said.
   About 1,000 people, mostly in management, would be eligible for
the visas, the spokesman said. He did not specify whether the
figure would include families.
   Chinese authorities would have to agree to let them leave, the
spokesman said, but the visas should reassure the employees that
they would have a right to come to France.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been embroiled in a
dispute with the colony's population over rights to settle in
Britain after Hong Kong comes under Chinese control.
   Last year's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
China rattled nerves of Hong Kong residents over what their future
might be like under a government headed by hardline Communists.
   Britain has said it would allow certain managers and
entrepreneurs immigration rights but that most of the colony's 5
million Chinese residents would have to stay in Hong Kong.
   British passports carried by the majority of Hong Kong subjects
are valid only as travel documents and do not allow them to settle
Britain.

<HEAD>Greyhound and Eastern: Some Similarities, Many Differences</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Greyhound bus drivers flexed their strike
muscle and stranded thousands of passengers, they didn't read the
skywriting of Eastern Airlines, another mass-transit business hit
by a mass walkout a year ago.
   Eastern also was paralyzed for a while but is now flying on a
smaller scale with replacement workers. Many strikers are jobless.
The strike forced the airline into bankruptcy court protection, but
Eastern expects to exit in months and report a profit in 1990 for
the first time in years.
   If that's a lesson to unions on the futility of striking, the
Greyhound drivers who struck the nation's only intercity bus system
this past week evidently didn't learn it.
   In some respects, the drivers share the same complaints as the
Eastern Machinists who struck last March 4. Both groups took pay
cuts in the 1980s, a decade of labor givebacks and retreats.
   Both were dealing with companies purchased by tough business
executives not known for union sympathy: Dallas investor Fred
Currey, who purchased Greyhound Lines Inc. for $270 million, and
Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who bought Eastern for $676
million.
   But many labor experts say that's largely where the similarities
between the Greyhound and Eastern strikers end.
   Some contend the bus drivers had much more leverage than the
Eastern workers, partly because Greyhound had no other source of
revenue except the bus line and only began preparing for a strike a
few weeks ago by training some replacement drivers.
   On the other hand Lorenzo, whose company also operates non-union
Continental Airlines, had an enormous advantage in weathering the
Eastern labor confrontation. Texas Air was even accused by a
bankruptcy-court official this past week of unfairly bleeding
Eastern for Continental's benefit. The company denied the claim but
will compensate Eastern with more than $280 million.
   ``Lorenzo has got the stuff to shuffle around,'' said Kim Moody,
executive director of the Labor Education and Research Project, a
Detroit-based group that follows the organized labor movement.
   It's hard to get a national bus line off the ground in short
order,'' he said. ``Unless there's an awful lot of ex-bus drivers
out there, these replacement drivers aren't qualified. You can't
train people to drive one of these things even halfway safely over
a couple of weeks.''
   Others said the drivers also had public pressure on their side.
While airline passengers waylaid by the Eastern strike eventually
were able to fly on other carriers, bus passengers are hostage to
what amounts to a Greyhound monopoly. In 9,000 of its 9,500
destinations, Greyhound is the only bus line.
   Some groups opposed to mandatory membership in labor unions
contend the Greyhound drivers' union has a history of rough tactics
to get what it wants. Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the National
Right to Work Committee, said ``While we respect the rights of bus
drivers to strike, one hopes violence won't be used to enforce
solidarity.''
   A 1983 study of union violence by the Industrial Research Unit
of the Wharton School suggested the drivers union was more violent
than many other unions. The union claims it does not advocate
violence.
   Nonetheless, the company's use of replacement drivers was seen
as helping provoke early violent incidents during the strike.
   ``We're about the only country in the civilized world that does
this sort of thing, running a business through a strike. Elswhere,
the business just shuts down,'' said Paul Gerhart, a professor of
industrial relations at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland.
   In other business and economic developments this past week:
   _Government reports provided mixed signals about the economy.
For example, sales of new homes fell 7.1 percent in January to
their lowest level in nearly a year and durable goods orders
plunged 10.5 percent in January, suggesting economic weakness.
Personal income rose 0.8 percent in January and 1989 fourth-quarter
gross national product growth was revised upward slightly,
suggesting strength.
   _Wall Street's slump deepened. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said
it would lay off 2,000 employees. Another casualty of the
securities boom of the 1980s, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., faced
congressional scrutiny into the final weeks before it collapsed
into bankruptcy last month.
   _The energy industry got a dose of good news and bad news. The
Seabrook nuclear power plant in New Hampshire, a focal point of
anti-nuclear movement protests, won full federal licensing
approval, 14 years after construction began. Exxon Corp. was
indicted on criminal charges stemming from the oil spill in Valdez,
Alaska, nearly a year ago and faces fines exceeding $600 million.

   ``Monday Night Football'' games are the latest
major sports events commanding eye-popping price increases from the
broadcast and cable networks battling for the rights to televise
them.
   But some advertising agency executives said Friday the bidders
may be overestimating advertisers' willingness to help defray the
costs of the huge television rights' contracts.
   ``I hear a lot more reluctance,'' said Allen Banks, media
director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS Advertising Inc. ``It raises more
questions about whether the networks have calculated the
advertisers' mood correctly.''
   Some media industry analysts said the bidders may be willing to
shoulder a loss on the contracts as an investment in the broader
welfare of their network _the games add to a network's prestige,
attract large numbers of men who often don't watch TV and and
provide a platform for promoting other programs.
   On top of that, they note when you have the games, your
competitors don't.
   The National Football League and Capital Cities-ABC Inc.'s ABC
Television Network announced late Thursday they had agreed on a
four-year contract reportedly valued at $900 million to broadcast
Monday night games.
   That works out to about $225 million a year, up 87.5 percent
from the $120 million annual average in ABC's previous Monday night
football contract.
   The increase in the payment per game is somewhat lower, however,
because the new package includes 17 Monday night games in each of
the first two years and 18 in the second two years of the contract.
Under the old three-year contract, there were only 16 Monday night
games.
   In addition, ABC will be getting the right to broadcast two new
playoff games that are being added to the schedule this year and
will get next year's Super Bowl, which will be the 25th annual
championship game.
   The NFL still is negotiating over the rights to its Sunday
afternoon games, which CBS and NBC broadcast under the previous
contract.
   Media analysts said the threat of competition from cable
networks and outlets such as the Fox television network were one
reason behind the giant leaps made this year in contracts rights
for football, baseball, basketball and college football and
basketball games.
   ESPN was the first cable network to land an NFL contract three
years ago, paying $153 million for the right to 13 games a year.
   But the NFL will be getting a reported $900 million from two
cable networks, ESPN and Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., for an
expanded schedule of Sunday night games over the next four years.
   Unlike the broadcast networks, the cable networks can rely on a
combination of higher ad rates and increased charges to cable
system operators to help them pay for the sports rights.
   Steve Bornstein, executive vice president at ESPN, said he
expects the network will boost ad rates and operator fees to pay
for the larger contract. But he noted that an increase in
subscribers who get ESPN and the addition of ``a couple''
commercials per game will also boost revenue.
   He said ESPN made a modest profit on its three-year contract and
expects to break even on its NFL games over the next four years.
   ESPN felt it had to pay what it did for the contract _ Bornstein
refused to confirm the reported figure of $450 million _ because
Turner reached agreement first on telecasting a package of Sunday
night games for a reported $450 million, Bornstein said.
   ``It's an important part of our programming menu,' he said.
   ABC refused to make any of its executives available Friday to
discuss how it intends to pay for the sharp increase in the
football contract.
   But Lisa Donneson, media analyst for County NatWest USA, said
she figures ABC will lose about $7 million during the first year of
the new Monday night contract, make a small profit the second year
and larger profits ``in the teens and 20's'' in the last two years.
   Her estimates assume a single-digit ad rate increase each year
and higher rates for ads in the new playoff games. She noted the
networks also may add commercial time to their broadcasts to
generate more revenue.
   Some analysts said ABC could ill afford to lose ``Monday Night
Football'' particularly because CBS outbid it last year for the new
major league baseball contract.
   Banks said the broadcasts also give ABC an extra way to promote
other prime-time shows as the network tries to overtake the
prime-time ratings leader, NBC.
   ``There is a belief that live sports is still very viable
programming entity that creates a point of difference that nobody
can copy,'' Banks said.
   But he noted that with sports ``proliferating across the
channel,'' its continued power to draw crowds and willing
advertisers will be sorely tested.

<HEAD>Breeden: SEC Investigating Drexel Bonuses</HEAD>

   The fate of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was
sealed not by $650 million in penalties agreed to pay to settle
fraud charges but by the firm's own investment strategy, Securities
and Exchange Chairman Richard C. Breeden says.
   ``I don't think you can justifiably say that it was the money
they had to pay in fines,'' Breeden told reporters Friday after
testifying before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee.
   Breeden also said the SEC is investigating the
multimillion-dollar bonuses Drexel paid its employees before its
collapse. Drexel has said it paid $260 million in bonuses in
December and January but that the decision to make the payments
came long before its financial woes became apparent.
   On Thursday, a Drexel lawyer told another congressional panel
that the firm needed to pay big bonuses to retain professionals
after the bad publicity and uncertainty following the plea bargain
in December 1988.
   If the bonuses were a dodge to reduce Drexel's assets before
seeking bankruptcy protection ``then its possible we'll take some
action,'' Breeden told the committee.
   Drexel, once the nation's fifth-largest securities firm,
collapsed in the wake of a sharp drop in the value of its
high-yield, high-risk junk bond portfolio and its admission of
securities law violations in a plea bargain with federal
prosecutors.
   The parent company sought protection from creditors under the
federal bankruptcy law Feb. 13 after defaulting on $100 million in
short-term debt and failing to gain new loans to help stem a cash
crisis.
   The SEC is seeking bankruptcy court certification as a Drexel
creditor because the firm still owes the government $150 million
from the settlement. While conceding Drexel would ``have been a
very different company had they not engaged in felony violations of
U.S. law,'' Breeden said the firm's fate rested with its
management's decisions.
   Drexel still had sizable cash and capital resources after
pleading guilty to six felony counts and agreeing to the $650
million settlement, he said.
   ``They could have tried to run a smaller firm. They were
unreasonably aggressive in maintaining a $28 billion balance sheet
with the level of borrowing they had,'' Breeden said.
