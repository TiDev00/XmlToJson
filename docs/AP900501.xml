   An Indian tribe whose spearfishing has
attracted protests plans to exercise a new treaty right: cutting
timber for free in public forests that are used by the state's $8
billion-a-year paper industry.
   The Mole Lake Chippewa band was authorized to begin cutting wood
Tuesday in the Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest north
of Minocqua.
   Ralph Hewett, a state Department of Natural Resources forester
in Boulder Junction, said four loggers from the Mole Lake band
``cut a couple of trees for the TV cameras'' Tuesday.
   ``But they really couldn't get started because they were waiting
for some shearing equipment,'' he said.
   They plan to sell the timber to existing mills, but eventually
want to start their own mills on the reservation.
   Hewett said the band was given permission to cut trees on five
tracts of land totaling 898 acres. The estimated value of the wood
is $166,000, he said.
   The Mole Lake is one of the state's six Chippewa bands that
retain the right to cut timber, hunt and use spears to catch fish
off-reservation in northern Wisconsin under 19th century federal
treaties. They retained those rights while giving up most of the
land.
   Since a federal court upheld those rights in 1983, the bands
have only exercised the right to spear fish out of season and have
encountered sometimes violent protests by fishermen who fear game
fish will be depleted.
   So far, the Mole Lake band is the only one seeking to cut timber.
   The wood selected for cutting amounts to about half of what the
state planned to offer for sale to non-Indian loggers this spring
in state-owned forests, DNR Chief Forester Charlie Higgs said.
   In past years, the state has sold tracts in its forests to the
highest bidding logging companies each spring. Those sales amounted
to about $2 million over the last five years.
   ``They (Indians) don't pay anything for it. The judge has ruled
that they have the right to harvest this timber at no cost,'' Higgs
said.
   Jim Landru, treasurer for the Mole Lake and coordinator of the
tribe's timber-cutting activities, said his band plans to sell the
wood it cuts to off-reservation mills. In the future, the band will
build its own mills, he said.
   ``This is something to get our feet wet and see how the process
goes,'' Landru said. ``There were more timber tracts offered, but
we don't have the resource for more now.''
   He said the enterprise would help generate jobs on reservations
where unemployment commonly exceeds 50 percent.
   The state enacted an administrative rule under which the timber
was offered first to the Chippewa before non-Indians were allowed
to bid, Higgs said. But in a lawsuit pending in federal court in
Madison, the Chippewa bands seek unlimited access to timber in
state- and county-owned forests.
   Landru said two Indian-owned logging businesses on the
reservation will handle cutting and selling of the timber this
spring. He said the tribe would probably get $35,000 and the
logging companies might make from $160,000 to $400,000 profit.
   Higgs and Hewett said non-Indian loggers are concerned about the
Chippewa logging and are worried about the future effects of
increased tribal logging on the state's forest products industry,
which employs about 77,000 people.
   ``We've heard some expression from them already and expect we'll
hear more in the future. They are concerned about what will be left
for them,'' Higgs said.
   Thomas Schmidt, president of the Wisconsin Paper Council, said
Tuesday the 33 state pulp and paper companies in his trade
association were watching the situation.
   ``We have monitored it very closely but we have taken no
position on it,'' he said.
   Schmidt said his group estimates about 2\-percent of the wood
consumed by Wisconsin's paper and pulp companies comes from state
forests each year and Chippewa logging could cut into that amount.
   Because Chippewa spearfishers have encountered demonstrations
staged by anti-treaty groups _ Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin and
Protect Americans' Rights and Resources _ the Mole Lake members
expect some resistance to their new endeavor, Landru said.
   ``I would anticipate some problems. The people here in northern
Wisconsin are basically good. But there is that group with Dean
Crist (STA) and PARR that seem to cause problems,'' he said.
   Crist, a leader of STA's anti-spearfishing protests, said Monday
his group has warned about the economic effects of tribal logging
and would consider staging some sort of protest.
   Higgs said non-Indian loggers are concerned about their
livelihood, but he believed the Chippewa timber-cutting would be
``a peaceful endeavor. We don't have any indication of
demonstrations at this point.''

<HEAD>Ashes of Ex-Panamanian Leader Stolen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIA VICTORIA GONZALEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of Gen. Omar Torrijos, a
former Panamanian military leader, were stolen Tuesday from the
crypt of a Roman Catholic Church in the capital, a police chief
said.
   Leslie Loaiza, director of the Judicial Police, said relatives
of Torrijos told police they believed the ashes were stolen from
the Corazon de Maria Roman Catholic church in the afternoon.
   A witness gave police the description of two suspects believed
to have made off with them, Loaiza said in a live interview on
KW-Radio Continente. He refused to give details other than repeat:
``We have their descriptions.''
   Loaiza said the general's eldest son, Martin Torrijos, and
Martin's brother-in-law, Marcelino Jaen, filed a complaint with
judicial authorities.
   Torrijos, the subject of the Graham Greene book ``Getting to
Know The General,'' seized power in a coup Oct. 11, 1968, and ruled
Panama as a military strongman until his death in a plane crash
July 31, 1979.
   His body remained in a mausoleum erected in his honor at nearby
Fort Amador, where U.S. and Panamanian military forces had a joint
command until late December, when the Panamanian Defense Forces
were disbanded following the American military invasion to oust
Torrijos' protege, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Torrijos had celebrated Panamanian nationalism and was behind
the Panama Canal Treaties, under which the canal will be turned
over from the United States to Panama by the year 2000.
   However, his nationalist ideas fell from favor following the
invasion and return to a civilian-led government.
   On Feb. 17, his body was removed from the mausoleum by his
family, cremated and the ashes deposited in the church crypt.
   His daughter, Raquel Torrijos, said at the time the decision was
taken because relatives had received anonymous calls saying ``the
general's tomb would be desecrated and his remains stolen.''

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunfire killed two
Mohawk Indians on Tuesday and police later closed off the
reservation, torn by a 9-month-old dispute over casino gambling.
   Troopers escorted investigators of the Quebec Provincial Force
through the New York section of the reservation Tuesday night to
reach the scene of the shootings, which occurred early Tuesday.
State police said they were entering the reservation as a
peacekeeping force.
   The first victim, Matthew Pyke, 22, was shot while he was
walking in the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation, in Snye,
Quebec, during gun battle between rival factions.
   A second body was discovered Tuesday afternoon by Joe Gray,
regional editor for the Daily Courier-Observer in Massena. Gray
said he saw a man lying face-up a short distance from where Pyke
was killed.
   ``I walked past this tree and saw a guy laying next to his
house. He didn't respond,'' Gray said. ``When I walked back, he
hadn't moved. I yelled to him several times and he didn't move.''
   The man was later identified by the Malone Evening Telegram as
J.R. Edwards, a member of the Warrior Society, a faction that has
appointed itself the protector of Mohawk sovereignty.
   Pierre Lemarbre, a constable with the Quebec police, said he was
a Mohawk in his 30s.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo ordered state police to assist Quebec
authorities in the investigation. State Police Supt. Thomas
Constantine recommended that no forces other than state police be
sent onto the reservation.
   Troopers sealed off the reservation at approximately 8:30 p.m.
Tuesday. Roadblocks were set up on all roads leading onto Indian
land and even residents were not being allowed to pass.
   ``The troopers told us we couldn't get in,'' said Tisha Jacobs.
She and her family were waiting at a service station outside the
reservation.
   Anti-gamblers blamed the reservation's self-appointed security
force for the first slaying and also pointed a finger of
responsibility at Cuomo, who they said has let the situation get
out of control.
   Pyke died at Alice Hyde Hospital in Malone after emergency
surgery, said Joyce Conto, an emergency room staffer. He was shot,
possibly twice, in the lower left part of his back, she said.
   Joe Lazore, who accompanied Pyke to the hospital, said he was
walking alongside Pyke when the shooting occurred. Lazore said the
shots came from a wooded area on the American side of the
reservation near the Salmon River.
   The reservation, called Akwesasne by the Mohawks and some
Canadians, occupies adjoining sections of New York state, Quebec
and Ontario.
   The shooting was being investigated by the Quebec Provincial
Police, along with the Akwesasne Police Force and the New York
State Police, said Constable Michel Martin.
   ``We don't have much information yet. We haven't even determined
where the shots came from,'' Martin said.
   Pyke and several others were helping families leave the Snye
area following a ``barrage'' of shooting between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m.,
said Barbara Barnes, a spokeswoman for the anti-gambling faction.
   There also was shooting at St. Regis, a community on the
Canadian side of the reservation, and shots were fired at a refugee
center on Cornwall Island, in the St. Lawrence River, where as many
as 2,000 Mohawks are staying since fleeing their homes Friday after
a week of nightly violence, she said.
   Barnes said Pyke was opposed to the casinos and the presence of
the Warrior Society, a heavily armed faction that has appointed
itself the protector of Mohawk sovereignty.
   ``The people are in shock and they are angry, but not just with
the Warriors. They are angry with Governor Cuomo. This could have
been avoided. For a governor who says he stands by law and order, I
can't believe he's let it come to this point at Akwesasne,'' Barnes
said.
   The Warriors denied responsibility for the death.
   ``The Warriors were not involved in the shooting,'' said Minnie
Garrow, who was answering calls at the group's headquarters. ``We
feel badly about the loss of life.''
   The gambling issue _ whether casinos and bingo halls should be
allowed on the reservation _ has been at the center of escalating
violence since last summer, when an FBI-led gambling raid triggered
a 12-day standoff between the Warriors and state police.
   The dispute also involves whether the reservation should be run
by traditional or elected leaders and whether state and federal
laws can be enforced on Mohawk land.
   Sporadic shootings and violence were reported throughout the
fall and winter, but tensions began to mount in March when gambling
opponents blockaded roads leading to the reservation to keep
outsiders away from the high-stakes casinos.
   The anti-gamblers promised to maintain the roadblocks until
tribal leaders addressed the reservation's problems, but last week
pro-gamblers tore down the blockades in a hailstorm of gunfire.
   The first injuries came Thursday when Brian Cole, one of the
barricade leaders, was badly beaten and suffered a fractured skull.
He is still in an Ottawa hospital.
   On Monday, the governor agreed to assign one of his top aides to
help negotiate a resolution, provided the violence stopped and the
casinos closed for now.
   In Ottawa, Canadian Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon chastised
Cuomo's response to the escalating violence.
   ``It is our desire to see the state of New York co-operate and
assist in dealing with the element (pro-gambling forces) on the New
York state side that appears to be provoking this incident,''
Siddon said Tuesday in the Commons.
   ``And to this point we're not satisfied the state of New York is
responding adequately,'' he said.

<HEAD>Man's Car Phone Found After Wife Calls Number and Entices Thief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After finding out that her husband's car phone
was stolen, Paula Thistle did what she thought a concerned wife
should do _ she called the thief and made a date.
   Mick Thistle had his car phone stolen Saturday night when he and
his wife, Paula, allowed a Naval Academy midshipman whom they
sponsor to take their car to Hood College in Frederick.
   Paula Thistle called the number and a man picked up after a few
rings and she became Paula Green, a lonely lady from Annapolis
looking for some fun.
   She managed to entice the would-be suitor into a rendezvous
inside the Naval Academy Sunday.
   ``I can only guess that this guy thought he was getting very
lucky,'' Mick Thistle said Monday. ``For whatever reason, he
started giving her the make and she let him.''
   The Thistles called the Naval Investigative Service. After the
car arrived for the meeting, a campus officer questioned the driver
and passenger and apprehended both, said Cmdr. Stephen E. Becker, a
spokesman at the academy.
   The two men turned out to be enlisted Navy personnel stationed
in the Annapolis area, Becker said.
   Becker said the two men, whose names are being withheld until
formal charges are brought, were turned over to their local
commands.
   ``You don't know how proud my wife is of this,'' Thistle said.

<HEAD>Poland's Fear of a United Germany Leads Agenda in Superpower Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World War II allies that carved up Nazi
Germany will meet this week to discuss Poland's fear that a unified
German state may try to take back some of its old lands.
   Foreign ministers from the Germanys and the United States,
Soviet Union, France and Britain are to meet in Bonn on Saturday to
discuss the global implications of German unification.
   A team of experts from the six nations held preliminary
discussions Monday night to prepare an agenda for the historic
talks.
   After meeting for six hours at a secluded guest house near a
castle north of East Berlin, the officials issued a brief statement
saying Poland's borders would be discussed at the Saturday session.
   Ultraconservatives in West Germany say a united Germany would
have a valid claim to large sections of Nazi Germany that were
ceded to Poland to make up for a larger section of Poland absorbed
by the Soviet Union after the war.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany caused a furor earlier
this year when he refused for several months to state unequivocally
that a united Germany would recognize Poland's existing borders.
   He later said he would recognize the boundaries.
   Poland will be allowed to participate in the six-nation talks
when its lands are discussed.
   The greater issue in the international talks _ the role of a
united Germany in the superpower alliances _ is to be discussed at
future negotiations involving the six nations alone.
   Moscow, worried about disrupting the current European balance of
power to its disadvantage, has rejected the West's position that a
united Germany must be a NATO member.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher were to hold informal talks Friday in advance of
Saturday's meeting.
   Soviet officials have indicated that they want a united Germany
to be military non-aligned, with joint membership in both the
Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   East Germany has said it is willing to agree to temporary NATO
membership if the alliance undergoes fundamental changes to reflect
the East-West thaw.
   East Germany is now in the Soviet-led alliance and West Germany
is in NATO.
   Kohl tried to ease Soviet objections on Monday.
   He said in a statement that he is ``certain that we will come to
a reasonable agreement, also with the Soviet Union'' on the matter
of a united Germany's strategic allegiances.
   Kohl added that West Germany is ``ready for a comprehensive
cooperation with the Soviet Union in the areas of economy,
technological exchanges, athletic meetings ... and cooperation in
security questions.''
   The statement did not elaborate on any of the points.
   The two Germanys, meanwhile, are holding separate talks on the
domestic aspects of reunification. They plan to merge their
economies and social institutions by July 2.
   Delegations from both countries held more negotiations in Bonn
on Monday and hoped to complete a final plan during meetings
Thursday and Friday in Berlin.
   Crucial differences still separate the Germanys.
   West Germany has said it will trade most East German marks at a
1-to-1 exchange, but wants to trade personal savings accounts of
more $2,300 at a 2-to-1 rate.
   East Germany is demanding a higher ceiling, and also wants to
temporarily retain subsidies for housing, energy and public
services.
   The two sets of talks on German unification likely will produce
several agreements that will lay a foundation for unification, but
a full political merger between the Germanys is not expected to be
completed until next year.

<TEXT>
   First they liked Ike, then they didn't like
Ike, then they liked Ike again: that's the pattern of historians'
appraisal of Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose place in history is still
to be fixed.
   Writing in the centennial year of Eisenhower's birth, historian
Alan Brinkley says there's something to be learned about America
and the American people from Eisenhower's see-saw reputation.
   Brinkley's view is pertinent since George Bush's presidency is
sometimes compared to Eisenhower's.
   Bush, like Ike, is prudent, uneager to expand government's role.
Like Ike, Bush is accused of lacking vision. Like Ike, Bush
presides at a time of peace and prosperity and is accused of doing
nothing about problems looming just below the surface.
   Bush, like Ike, is enormously popular in the polls. At this
stage, he seems as unbeatable as was Ike when he ran for
re-election in 1956.
   When people are suspicious of government, have been disappointed
by it and expect little from it, says Brinkley, their appreciation
rises for Eisenhower and his safe but inactive tenure.
   When people look to government for bold leadership and vision,
he says, do-nothing Ike falls in repute.
   Brinkley, a 1971 graduate of Princeton who was a snip of a lad
when Eisenhower was president, is professor of history at the
graduate school of the City University of New York. He reviews the
record in the Wilson Quarterly, a magazine published by the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars.
   Jimmy Carter is undergoing the same sort of reappraisal that's
been Eisenhower's fate.
   Carter's stance as an outsider and his ``I'll never lie to you''
campaign seemed just the antidote to the disillusionments of
Vietnam and Watergate. But, plagued by events beyond his control _
the Iran hostage crisis and the oil embargo _ he left office
condemned as ineffective.
   Lately, building on his peacemaker's reputation forged in the
Camp David accord, Carter has been winning fresh respect for his
selfless pursuit of a better world.
   In Eisenhower's case, he was much loved by a people he did not
much lead.
   His presidency, says Brinkley, ``mirrored the success and
complacency that characterized much of American life during the
1950s,'' the ``I Love Lucy'' era.
   Genial Ike, war hero, played golf and bridge and palled around
with rich businessmen. Despite his popularity, historians had begun
finding fault with his record even before he left office.
   ``Throughout the 1960s and much of the 1970s, scholars dismissed
Eisenhower as a bland mediocrity, a model of what a 20th Century
president should not be,'' Brinkley says.
   A 1962 poll of historians ranked Eisenhower 22nd out of 33
presidents, just above Chester A. Arthur. The charge was that he
failed to govern or inspire. Historians saw him as passive,
ineffective, even ``vaguely stupid,'' Brinkley recalls.
   By the end of the 1970s, however, a new verdict was taking hold,
partially because the Eisenhower papers had become available to
scholarship.
   No longer seen as the stumblebum, Ike now was regarded as
decisive and skillful, articulate, informed and commanding.
   In a new poll, in 1982, historians ranked him ninth, above John
F. Kennedy.
   This was post-Vietnam and post-Watergate. Ike was seen as having
shrewdly known the limits of American power.
   The evaluation arose from ``the profound disillusionment with
social activism that began during the late 1960s; the association
of liberalism with Vietnam, with economic instability, with racial
conflict and with the disappointing results of social policy
initiatives,'' Brinkley says.
   What doomed Ike to condescension had been ``his refusal to
accept the idea that government had a great and compelling
mission,'' says Brinkley.
   What raised him in estimation were those same qualities, he
says, at ``a time when many Americans came to question the
desirability of a powerful president and the feasibility of a large
and active government.''
   ``Nothing in Dwight D. Eisenhower's uneventful presidency
ensures him an important place in political history. He was not a
Lincoln or Wilson or Roosevelt, who led the nation through great
crises,'' says Brinkley. ``He was not a Kennedy or Johnson or
Nixon, who, for better or worse, charted new paths and left the
nation's public life forever altered.''
   Brinkley's verdict: Ike's reputation will remain ``a hostage to
Americans' fluctuating expectations of their leaders and their
state.''

<TEXT>
   Kay Orr made history in 1986 when she
became the nation's first Republican woman to be elected a
governor, but Democrats eyeing her low job approval ratings hope
her tenure itself soon will be history.
   Mrs. Orr, whose troubles began in 1987 when she pushed through a
tax overhaul that turned out to be a tax increase, acknowledges she
has problems but says they can be overcome.
   ``We need to get across our message and our record of
accomplishment,'' she said in a recent interview. ``We're working
on it.''
   Four Democrats, in a field of seven, are in a too-close-to-call
race for their party's nomination in the May 15 primary.
   Mrs. Orr, 51, faces only token primary opposition but
nonetheless is running no-nonsense television commercials and has
raised nearly $1 million in campaign contributions.
   In one TV ad, she acknowledges the political faux pas on the tax
package and says: ``I made a mistake.''
   The governor and her pollster dispute a recent Omaha
World-Herald poll that put her job approval rating at 39 percent,
the lowest in the 20-year history of the poll. She said her own
polling showed her with a 52 percent approval rating statewide.
   State GOP Chairman Norm Riffel contends that Mrs. Orr's
political strength will prove ample once she has a single opponent
to run against rather than seven Democratic foes training their
fire on her.
   Democrats seeking to unseat her include former Omaha Mayor Mike
Boyle; Omaha attorney-businessman Ben Nelson; Lincoln Mayor Bill
Harris; and Bill Hoppner of Lincoln, a businessman and former top
aide to Sens. Bob Kerrey and Jim Exon.
   Mrs. Orr appeared to be on an historic roll when she was elected
in 1986. She defeated Democrat Helen Boosalis in the nation's first
gubernatorial race in which both major party candidates were women.
Another political first had come in 1982 when she was elected state
treasurer and thus became the first woman elected to a statewide,
constitutional office.
   An early and ardent supporter of former President Reagan, Mrs.
Orr was co-chairman of the platform committee at the 1988
Republican National Convention. President Bush and Vice President
Dan Quayle both have visited Nebraska in recent months to campaign
for her.
   Mrs. Orr came under fire when she pushed through a rewrite of
the state's income tax system in 1987, along with major legislation
giving tax breaks to business for job creation and new investment.
   Critics said at the time it was a tax increase for lower- and
middle-income Nebraskans. Mrs. Orr, who had campaigned on a pledge
to fight new or higher taxes, first argued that it wouldn't be a
tax increase, period. She later acknowledged that the tax burden of
some would increase but the overall income tax rewrite would be
``revenue neutral.'' She was wrong again.
   Mrs. Orr is hoping to turn the tax issue around and use it to
her benefit now that the 1990 Legislature has overridden her veto
of a bill to raise state sales tax and income tax rates to help
reduce property taxes.
   She presents herself as having learned a lesson in 1987, and
being thus dedicated to protecting taxpayers from a program she
says won't guarantee property tax relief.
   On the Democratic side, Harris and Hoppner have raised questions
about Nelson's connections, direct or indirect, with the junk bond
industry. Nelson said his specialty was ensuring that companies
complied with government regulations in that area.
   ``To criticize me is like criticizing the fireman for the
fire,'' he said.

   Shirley MacLaine has suspended her one-woman
musical revue ``Out There Tonight'' until June because of a knee
injury.
   Miss MacLaine, 56, will undergo arthroscopic surgery this week
on her right knee to remove floating pieces of torn cartilage,
publicist Dale C. Olson said Monday.
   The entertainer fell on stage in Seattle during a March 2
performance of the show. She continued the tour for three weeks in
San Francisco before the injury flared up Sunday during rehearsals,
Olson said.
   The injury will force the postponement of a five-week run of
``Out There Tonight'' at the Pantages Theatre that was to begin
today. The engagement was rescheduled to begin Aug. 28. She is
expected to pick up the tour June 12 in Pittsburgh.

   Producer Howard Kazanjian says he sees a movie
based on the religious novel ``This Present Darkness'' as a
technological thriller.
   Film rights to the Frank Peretti book have been sold to a
Hollywood group that includes Kazanjian. His work has included the
adventures ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Return of the Jedi.''
   Joining him in the project is Bruce Isacson, who worked on
``Tender Mercies,'' and actor Dean Jones, who has appeared in
numerous Walt Disney films.
   The sale price of the rights was not disclosed in a statement by
the book's publisher, Crossway Books in Westchester, Ill.
   ``This Present Darkness,'' about spiritual warfare between
angels and demons above a small town, has sold more than 1.3
million copies since it was published in 1986.
   Kazanjian said he envisions the film as ``a highly specialized
technological sight and sound thriller.'' The producer said he is
looking for a screenwriter and hopes the film will be released by a
major studio in 1992.

   Marshall Teague, who has had parts in
television's ``Columbo'' and the movie ``Roadhouse,'' says the
easiest role for him is that of a policeman.
   That's because he was once a sheriff's deputy in Shelby County,
which includes Memphis.
   Teague said in a recent interview that he has learned one
important lesson from his careers as an actor and deputy sheriff:
``You can't always stop the bad guys, not even in the movies.''
   The Newport native moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting 13
years ago.

   Farrah Fawcett has ruled out marriage.
   The actress said that men don't like her independence and that
longtime love Ryan O'Neal is the only man so far who has accepted
it.
   She said O'Neal still proposes marriage, even after 10 years,
but it's not for her ``because marriage is purely a business
contract. It kills romance.''
   In 1977, she divorced actor Lee Majors and quit the TV series
``Charlie's Angels.''
   Majors was the silent type, she said in an interview Monday.
   ``Lee didn't talk. He thought I should come home and make the
dinner. And he didn't support me leaving the show,'' she said.
   At ``Charlie's Angels,'' she said, ``the male producers kept
patting me on the head while I was complaining that the characters
had no depth.''
   She has since starred in such acclaimed movies as
``Extremities'' and ``The Burning Bed.''

   Here is the text of remarks by President Bush
and former hostage Robert Polhill during a ceremony Monday at the
White House.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, let me say the purpose of all of this is
simply to welcome Mr. and Mrs. Polhill to the White House. I just
had a chance to tell him how pleased we are that he is free. And,
of course, this comes at a very special moment because Mr. Reed is
now free and I expect to be talking to him as soon as he finishes
that initial contact and debrief over there, hopefully within the
next hour or two.
   But I do want to take this opportunity to thank Syria for its
role in not only bringing Mr. Polhill home, but its role in the
Reed release; similarly to thank Iran for its role and simply to
say that I hope this is a forerunner to the release of the other
American hostages and the others from other countries held against
their will. Things seem to be moving on this.
   And Mr. Polhill, welcome to the White House. And I just can't
tell you how overjoyed Barbara and I are to have both of you here.
   MR. POLHILL: Thanks very much, President Bush. I feel very badly
that I can't talk to you quite as well as I'd like to be able to
because there are a lot of things I want to say to the American
people.
   But the most important thing I think now to say is to reinforce
what President Bush has just said, that I am at this moment truly
as happy for Frank and Fifi Reed as I was eight days ago for Ferial
and myself, and for both families. I sincerely hope that Frank is
step two in what will be a continuing release of hostages and
bringing us all back from American hostages through all of the
other countries who may be involved.
   The warmth and sincerity of the welcome I've received everywhere
I have been, from Damascus to Wiesbaden to Washington, has been
truly thrilling. Frank Reed is going to feel the way I felt because
the American people are behind us and have been behind our families
throughout this ordeal and we're deeply grateful to you for that.
   I'm not going to try to say very much more because I know even
with the help of this device, you're not going to get very much
more. So I'll _ even though I'm a bit of a ham, you see. I'd like
to be able to do better, but you'll have to work with my sons, I
think. Thank you so much.
   Q Mr. President, will Israel now cut a deal for the remaining
Shi'ite prisoners?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I have no knowledge of anything of that nature.
   Q Would it help?
   Q Mr. President, why do you think that Iran and Syria are
cooperating at this point?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, because I hope there is a realization that
holding people against their will is not the way to effect
political change. I'm not suggesting, in reply to your question,
that Syria and Iran are the ones that are holding the remaining
hostages, but I can't explain the rationale, but I can express a
certain gratitude that things seems to be moving and what I feel in
my heart about the return of, now, these two Americans is, in a
sense, overwhelming but I don't think any American can totally
rejoice until the rest are free. And indeed, we can't limit our
concern and our feelings to just the Americans, in my view.
   So we will just keep on track and when, as now, there's a reason
to say, ``Thank you,'' certainly we'll do that. But beyond that, I
just hope that the process _ if this is process, I hope it
continues. And I don't want to make Mr. Polhill speak again, but I
feel confident I speak for him and for his wife. And you heard what
he said beautifully about Mr. Reed and we feel that way about all
the rest of them, too.
   Q Is there any way possible at this point to return the goodwill
gesture?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: We're _ as I've said, we can't, you know, in
terms of overall relationship between countries, expect normalcy
until _ or expect vast improvement until all Americans are freed.
We're not in a piecemeal basis, bidding for human life holding out
hopes only to have them dashed _ one American family or another.
That is not the way I see, certainly, my responsibilities. But when
a step is taken that goes toward that day when all hostages are
released, I should say thank you. But beyond that I can't say that
I _ that I can be happy. I try to put myself in the place of the
other families, and say, ``Hey, how about my loved one?''
   And so, this is a tough business, and I just want to conduct the
policy of this country in a way to facilitate the continuation of
this process, if, indeed, it is a process. And I don't know that.
   And I don't expect Mr. Polhill knows it either. I've got time
for a couple of more, and I don't want to keep this tired man _
make him even ``tireder.'' Yeah?

   Q Mr. President, can you tell us what it is that Iran did that
you're thanking them for, and whether you've had any further
information on whether they aided in Mr. Polhill's release?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we did hear from Syria that Iran had been
helpful. And it is that that I'm saying thank you for. It is _
   Q And for Mr. Polhill?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes.
   Yes?
   Q Is it time for Israel to, perhaps, make a deal to release
Sheik Obeid, or the 400 Shiites, or would you object if they didn't?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I don't _ there is certainly no objection. And
that is a matter for others to determine. I've stated that holding
people against their will is not a way to facilitate political
change or any other kind of change. So, that's it. Last one. Yeah,
Ellen?
   Q Mr. President, are you (rejecting or holding out ?) any type
of a goodwill gesture towards Iran and Syria at this time until all
the Americans are released?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I've said that we cannot have normalcy as long
as any American is held against his will. And I think everybody
understands that _ that in terms of expressing appreciation to
those who facilitated the release of Mr. Polhill or the release of
Mr. Reed, certainly I'm prepared to do that. I've done that here
today. But that _ I can't say that that's an overwhelming
expression of good will, because I have on mind those other six
Americans that are held.
   But, look, if it's beginning to work, and if, indeed, there's a
process, I expect I speak for all Americans when I say I rejoice in
that. But that's about where we've got to leave it, Ellen. We've
got to see every American returned. And that's the way it's going
to be. And I'm very pleased that this Polhill release has been
facilitated, and you heard him express his joy for the Reeds. And
all I'd say to that is ``Amen, thank God.''
   (Several questioners speak at once.)
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I can't take any more questions. We _ I can't do
it. (Laughs.)
   Q Mr. Polhill _ (audio break) _ anything that could be done to
return the goodwill gesture at this point?
   MR. POLHILL: No, I'm not conversant. You may be surprised, but I
really don't know very much about what was going on around me. So,
I don't think I can offer a lot of help to anyone. The only thing I
can suggest is that the American people continue to show, as
hostages continue to be released on a regular basis, how much we
are wanted back. And I think that message might get across very
clearly.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: That's a good point. That's a good point.
   Q Are you carrying a message to the President? Are you carrying
a message from the hostage-takers.
   MR. POLHILL: They said I was.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: _ deal with these guys. You'll be out here all
night. (Laughter.)

<HEAD>American Finds Himself a Conservative Among Soviet Reformers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American defector who traded Texas for Moscow
says he and his family have been warmly welcomed but that he's been
surprised to find himself defending socialist ideals from criticism
by Soviet reformers.
   Arnold Lokshin's comments, carried in Monday's editions of
Pravda, offered a rare glimpse into the life of one of the few
West-to-East defectors.
   Since leaving the United States 3{ years ago, Lokshin has
declined to speak to American reporters and has dropped from the
sight of the foreign community.
   Pravda said he runs a government cancer research laboratory and
lives with his wife and three children in a three-room apartment on
Novocheremushkinsky Street in southern Moscow.
   His wife, Lauren, keeps house and looks after the children:
Jeffrey, in ninth grade, Michael, in second grade, and Jennifer, a
student in the Mikhail Lomonsov Chemical Institute, the Communist
Party daily said.
   The article did not say how the Lokshins were coping with the
hardships and consumer shortages of life in the Soviet Union.
   In the Pravda interview, Lokshin voiced political views that
appeared conservative in the context of the reform movement
sweeping the country.
   He stood up at a political meeting in Moscow last week and said:
``We are often asked, `What did you find in the Soviet Union that
you least expected?''' the report said.
   ``We never expected that an American family in the Soviet Union
would be defending the October Revolution, socialism, and the
teachings of Lenin,'' Pravda quoted him as saying. Vladimir I.
Lenin led the October Revolution that forged the Soviet state in
1917.
   ``We aren't tourists here. We came a long time ago, and we are
getting our feet on the ground. Therefore, we feel like part of
your society, and not sideline observers,'' Lokshin said.
   ``At the same time, we realize perfectly well that we do not
have the right to interfere in your internal affairs. After all, we
are still citizens of the United States,'' Lokshin said.
   Lokshin, then 47, fled with his family to the Soviet Union in
October 1986, saying he had been a Communist Party organizer and
had been fired as head of St. Joseph Hospital's Cancer Research
Institute in Houston because of his political views.
   His former employers said he was fired because of job
performance.
   ``When we came to the Soviet Union, we had no illusions,''
Lokshin said. ``Our departure from the U.S.A. was necessary, an
extreme step. And we did not expect to find such a heartfelt, warm
welcome in the Soviet Union.''
   ``We now have quite a few friends among the Soviet people, with
whom we can openly discuss the most varied problems,'' agreeing
with some, disagreeing with others, Lokshin said.
   And he regretted that some people with whom it was impossible to
discuss politics ``unfortunately, still hold positions of
responsibility. Unfortunately, bureaucratism is still strong.''

   Communications problems with a circling U.S. Air
Force gunship may have hampered efforts by American commandos to
seize a civilian airport at the start of the Panama invasion,
Jane's Defense Weekly reports.
   Four Navy SEAL commandos were killed and eight wounded in the
first stages of the December invasion as they tried to secure the
civil airfield at Paitilla on the southeast coast of Panama City.
   Jane's reported that the sea, air and land commandos could not
communicate with the AC-130 gunship, ``which could have provided
valuable intelligence and fire support.''
   Excerpts of the article came in a magazine release Monday ahead
of the issue's publication Saturday.
   It said the aircraft's sensors and night vision equipment might
have been able to spot Panamanian Defense Forces troops and alert
the SEALs. It said the SEALs could also have called upon the
gunship for highly accurate targeted firepower to suppress the
Panamanian troops.
   Jane's said in a report from Washington that a force of 48 SEALS
was ordered to secure the airport, where Panama's then-leader, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, kept his private plane.
   American officials feared Noriega, who was wanted on drug
charges in the United States, would flee in the plane.
   The magazine said the SEALs encountered snipers almost as soon
as they landed at the airport. It said they achieved ``gunfire
superiority'' within five minutes and disabled Noriega's aircraft
by firing anti-tank rounds into it, but still lost men.
   ``The SEAL leadership is examining how the fatalities and
casualties happened,'' the magazine said.
   It quoted an unidentified senior Navy official close to
``Operation Just Cause'' as saying the organization ``looked at
whether the SEALs were adequately armed and whether the mission was
appropriate for the relatively small number of SEALs deployed.''
   The magazine said the Air Force has told the Navy it was able to
communicate with all other units except the SEALs, ``suggesting
that the SEALs were the reason for the lack of communications.''
   It said the SEALs maintain they tried unsuccessfully to call the
AC-130 on every possible frequency and that the aircraft did not
respond. Jane's said that the next day the SEALs were able to
communicate easily with other AC-130s brought in to fly air cover.
   It quoted the naval official as saying it was not known why
communications with the gunship failed. He was quoted as saying it
was unclear whether there would have been fewer casualties had the
SEALs been able to talk to the plane's crew.
   Jane's said the U.S. Navy and U.S. Special Operations Command
have not provided public details of the gunfire exchange between
the SEALs and the Panamanian units.
   Noriega surrendered to U.S. troops and was taken to Florida,
where he is in jail awaiting trial on drug charges.
   Civilian Guillermo Endara, who was winning an election in May
1988 when Noriega stopped ballot-counting, now is president.

<TEXT>
   Francisca Centeno's blood ran cold
as she listened to a Contra rebel describe his part in a 1987
attack on this cooperative farm that left her home a smoldering
ruin.
   ``He was all worked up, telling how he set a truck on fire with
his machine gun,'' said the 28-year-old mother of five, an infant
on her hip.
   After attacking the Las Colinas cooperative three times since
1984, the Contras are back. The Sandinista-organized project where
60 familes cultivate corn, beans, coffee and bananas sits in the
heart of Security Zone 1.
   The zone is about 80 miles north of Managua and is one of five
U.N.-monitored enclaves where the anti-Sandinista irregulars are
gathering for what is supposed to be their demobilization.
   But the Contras are refusing to heed calls from the new
government to surrender their weapons and have threatened to resume
the civil war that claimed some 30,000 lives if Sandinistas are not
removed from positions of power in the military.
   The Contras' behavior in Las Colinas has raised fears among
members of the cooperative, many of whom were landless peasants
before the Sandinistas organized the farm and who remain loyal to
the leftist revolution.
   Residents say they fear the rebels will seize their homes and
evict them.
   Such fears are part of the reason Sandinista Gen. Humberto
Ortega wants to retain control of the army until the Contras
disarm. They also explain why the Sandinistas passed out weapons to
their loyalists in some parts of the countryside after Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro won the Feb. 25 elections.
   In Las Colinas, the Sandinistas disarmed. So the Contras are in
command.
   ``We're civilians. They walk through here armed to the teeth,
and we're afraid,'' said Mrs. Centeno.
   She said the Contra fighter who recounted the 1987 attack stood
right at the stoop of her home and was belligerent and threatening.
   ``It felt like my blood was freezing,'' she said.
   ``He said we should start looking for someplace else to live,
because they were going to take our houses and stay here for
good,'' she said, tears coming to her eyes. ``A mother with five
kids doesn't want to become a rolling stone.''
   About 4,000 of the U.S.-supported rebels have arrived in Zone 1,
the largest of the five enclaves.
   Hundreds are also camped within a mile or two of Las Colinas,
and Contras can be seen walking the settlement's dusty paths or
sitting on the cement porches of the homes. The walls of most of
the homes are covered with Sandinista slogans or campaign
propaganda hailing Daniel Ortega, who lost the Feb. 25 election to
Mrs. Chamorro.
   A banner at the entrance to the settlement saluting residents
who died in the nine-year civil war as ``Heroes and Martyrs'' was
torn down by Contras last week.
   ``We're Sandinistas. But we also love peace,'' said one
resident, 20-year-old Ramon Celedon.
   Celedon, like all men of the settlement, was part of the local
militia but handed in his weapon on April 21 on the orders of a
Sandinista army officer.
   ``I feel like I was tricked,'' said Celedon. ``If they (the
Contras) don't hand in their guns, then we handed ours in for
nothing.''
   Pedro Aguilar said he feels humiliated when armed Contras walk
through the cooperative.
   ``They walk through here and in an offensive way tell people how
they won the war,'' said Aguilar. ``That's a lie, but it makes us
feel humiliated.'' His father Benvenuto was one of seven members
killed in a June 3, 1987 Contra attack.
   As Aguilar spoke a Contra fighter with a rocket-propelled
grenade launcher over his shoulder walked into his home. The Contra
was obviously acquainted with Aguilar, and exchanged a few words
with his wife.
   ``If they don't disarm, we are determined to defend the
revolution's achievements,'' Aguilar said. ``We would be willing to
re-arm because to allow oneself to be kidnapped or killed with
impunity would be a sin.''
   On another porch two Contras, Wilmer Picado and Francisco
Herrera, quietly conversed with cooperative member Santos Aguilar
and his wife, Maria.
   Santos Aguilar, no relation to Pedro, fought the Contras in 1987
when he served in the Sandinista army.
   ``We have to bury the past,'' Santos Aguilar said.
   Picado agreed. ``The goal now is that there be peace.''

   The brother and sister are Republicans and hope to win the May 8
election, but they don't foresee any bitterness afterward.

   There is a hitch for the family.
   Three of five other siblings live in Roane County and must

   It was the bang _ not the bite _ that
had Jerry Dewitt jittery after tearing into an old vaccum cleaner
bag.
   Dewitt found a 3-foot-long rattlesnake in the bag April 22, when
he picked up an abandoned vacuum cleaner from a shed to toss onto a
junk pile.
   He killed the snake with a long spear more often used on frogs,
then opened the bag to make sure the poisonous creature had no
friends.
   Instead, Dewitt discovered three tubes about 9 inches long that
were labeled ``Termanix _ highly explosive if armed.'' He called
authorities.
   ``The snake didn't bother me. If it had been a little bigger I
would have skinned it,'' Dewitt said. ``But the explosives kind of
gave me a shock because I was beating on the bag trying to get the
snake.''

   American hostage Frank Reed was freed
Monday after being held for 43 ``endless'' months, much of the time
blindfolded, by Shiite Moslem kidnappers in Lebanon. He was the
second American freed in nine days.
   ``I'd like to tell my family, especially my son Tarek, that his
daddy is well. He is a little skinny, but he will be home very
soon,'' the 57-year-old educator from Malden, Mass., told state-run
Syrian TV after his release.
   He flew from Damascus to Rhein-Main Air Base just outside
Frankfurt, West Germany early Tuesday aboard a U.S. Air Force C-141
transport plane, arriving in brilliant, sunny weather.
   He was boud for nearby Wiesbaden, where he was to undergo the
customary medical checks at a U.S. military hospital and a State
Department debriefing.
   Reed, wearing a white shirt and a dark suit, stepped off the
plane looking sprightly. He made no comments to reporters, but blew
them a kiss.
   The former captive walked quickly across a red carpet that had
been laid out in his honor, and made the ``V'' for victory sign
with both hands in the air. A small crowd of military personnel
nearby applauded.
   At one point, Reed reached down and touched the ground on the
way to a small van that took him to a waiting helicopter for the
trip to Wiesbaden. An Air Force honor guard stood by.
   In the Boston suburb of Malden, Reed's Syrian Moslem wife,
Fahima ``Fifi'' Reed, 39, saw her husband on television and
exclaimed, ``He looks great! He's in a suit. ... I want to see
everybody happy as I am now.''
   She will join him in Wiesbaden.
   Reed, director of a private school in Beirut and a Beirut
resident since 1977, converted to Islam to marry Fahima. Tarek is
their 9-year-old son.
   Reed was freed in Beirut at 8:30 p.m. (1:30 p.m. EDT), Syrian
officials said, and was driven to the Syrian capital, where Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa turned him over to U.S. Ambassador Edward
Djerejian.
   President Bush hailed Reed's release as Bush welcomed former
hostage Robert Polhill to the White House, another U.S. educator
who was freed in Lebanon on April 22 after 39 months in captivity.
Bush thanked Syria and Iran for their help in securing the releases
and said ``things seem to be moving,'' but that there could be no
rest ``until all hostages are free.''
   There are still 16 Westerners, including six Americans, held in
Lebanon.
   The Iranian newspaper Tehran Times said Tuesday that unless
Washington answers the latest releases with goodwill gestures, no
more Americans will go free.
   Sharaa said at a ministry briefing featuring Reed, ``I hope this
second gesture of good will will be met with a similar gesture of
good will during the process of releasing the rest of the
hostages.''
   Djerejian thanked Syria for its ``active role'' in Reed's
release and made special note of the help from Iran.
   Reed's kidnappers, who called themselves the Organization of the
Islamic Dawn in a communique Sunday that promised Reed's release
within 48 hours, said he would carry a message to the U.S.
government.
   But Reed, who appeared pale and had grown a white beard,
mentioned no such message and declined to answer reporters'
questions out of concern for those still held _ ``I do not want to
say anything that could harm them.''
   The freed captive appeared in reasonable health. He wore a dark
suit and a blue tie. His voice was husky.
   Reed said he hoped the other hostages will be freed soon, but
would not say if he saw any of them in captivity. However, Reed
referred to ``we'' while describing the conditions of his captivity.
   After saying he had adequate food and fresh fruit and a chance
to bathe and shower, he said, ``We were given fresh clothes fairly
regularly, washed and so on.
   ``Our problem was the passage of endless time. ... ``We had no
information ... We had no nothing. We had no radio. We had no news.
... There were times I really did not even know what month it was.''
   ``We were given lots of books and allowed to watch TV but never
the news.'' However, he later said: ``I refused the books and TV. I
didn't want to be entertained when I lost my freedom.''
   He said on TV of his captivity, ``It was lonely. It was boring.''
   Reed spoke haltingly at times, his eyes downcast. ``I haven't
talked much'' as a hostage, he explained.
   He said he did not hold the Lebanese people responsible for his
ordeal, and he thanked Syria for its efforts ``in helping me become
a free man.''
   Reed said he was blindfolded 24 hours a day during much of his
captivity.
   ``I feel odd that my blindfold is not here,'' he said, touching
his face.
   ``I hope, Godspeed, that my colleagues ... somehow will be
released soon.'' Reed's abduction was earlier claimed by the
Organization of Arab Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade.
   In Beirut, Reed was handed to officers of the Syrian army
contingent that controls east and north Lebanon as well as Moslem
west Beirut, where Reed was kidnapped on Sept. 9, 1986, said the
Syrian officials, who refused to be identified. The Syrian military
presence dates from an Arab League peacekeeping mandate in the
15-year-old Lebanese civil war.
   The officials refused to specify the release site.
   Most of the remaining hostages are believed held by Shiite
groups loyal to Iran. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Following Polhill's release, by a shadowy faction calling itself
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, Iranian officials
and Lebanese Shiite leaders called for reciprocal releases of
Shiite fundamentalists held by Israel and Kuwait.
   The Tehran Times said Tuesday: ``Release of two American
hostages without any pre-conditions and solely for humanitarian and
Islamic causes was an extreme gesture of good will and
self-sacrifice by Lebanese Moslem groups.
   ``The Islamic Republic used its maximum power and credibility
for the release of the hostages. Naturally, without an appropriate
response from the West, there is no chance for the continuation of
Iranian mediation.''
   ``Now the ball is in the court of the U.S. and the Western
countries,'' said the paper, which is close to Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   It said Iran and the militants in Lebanon expect Washington and
its allies to pressure Israel to release a ``significant number''
of detainees, specifically Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.
   Obeid is a Shiite cleric with the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah.
He was abducted by Israel from south Lebanon on July 28, 1989.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for
factions holding most of the hostages in Lebanon.
   Besides Tarek, Reed has two children, Jacqueline and Marilyn,
from his first marriage. They live in Medford, Mass.
   Reed's 91-year-old mother, Leota Sprague, said Monday she never
lost faith her son would be free one day.
   ``I haven't been able to cry for four years,'' she said. ``Now I
can smile and say, `Thank God.'''

   Moviegoers opted for a hooker in high heels
over the heroes on the half shell as ``Pretty Woman'' overtook
``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' as the top film.
   ``Pretty Woman,'' the modern-day Pygmalion tale starring Richard
Gere as a businessman and Julia Roberts as his lover for hire,
collected $7.2 million at North American movie theaters, according
to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   The film has now grossed $81.3 million and shows no sign of
fading.
   ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' finally showed signs of cooling
after making $98 million in just five weeks. The film about the
sewer-dwelling turtles tumbled 30 percent over the previous weekend
to land in second.
   The new horror film ``The Guardian,'' featuring Jenny Seagrove
as a baby sitter you would rather not have watching your young
ones, opened strongly in third with ticket sales of $5.6 million.
   It was followed in fourth by ``Spaced Invaders,'' a story of
aliens hearing Orson Welles' famous radio broadcast and coming to
aid the invasion. The film grossed $4.5 million.
   ``The Hunt for Red October,'' starring Sean Connery and Alec
Baldwin, finished in fifth with ticket sales of $3 million. In
sixth with $2.8 million was the new film ``Q &amp; A,'' starring Nick
Nolte and Timothy Hutton in a police thriller.
   The soft-core, Mickey Rourke-on-a-motorcycle drama ``Wild
Orchid'' opened well in limited release, netting $2.6 million while
playing on 819 screens. It was trailed by the Oscar-winning
``Driving Miss Daisy'' in eighth on receipts of $1.6 million.
   In ninth was the stylish crime drama ``Miami Blues'' with $1.46
million, followed in 10th by the comedy ``Crazy People'' with $1.43
million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1 ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $7.2 million, 1,710 screens, $4,182
per screen, $81.3 million, six weeks.
   2. ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' New Line, $6.9 million,

<HEAD>US Blames Troop Presence for Problems in Relations with Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department marked the 15th
anniversary of the fall of Saigon by saying Vietnam's troops in
Cambodia are hampering the administration's efforts to establish
normal diplomatic relations with Vietnam.
   ``The formal precondition for normalization remains an
acceptable political settlement in Cambodia which includes
verification of the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces,''
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Monday.
   The Vietnamese foreign minister, Nguyen Co Thach, said in an
interview with Time magazine last week that the United States was
using Cambodia as a pretext for not establishing diplomatic
relations, and that his government had met all conditions
previously set.
   Those conditions, he said, included agreements on accounting for
missing U.S. military personnel, reunification of Vietnamese
families split by the war and on ending human rights abuses in
re-education camps.
   ``We would like to have normal relations with all countries in
Indochina, including Vietnam,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``We have no
philosophical objection to normalization of relations with
Vietnam.''
   She added, ``As a practical reality, the pace and scope of
normalization will depend upon continued cooperation with us on the
POW-MIA and other humanitarian issues.''
   Ms. Tutwiler declined to elaborate on what might constitute a
``philosophical objection.''
   The fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, ended the Vietnam War with
a victory for Communist North Vietnam over South Vietnam, backed by
the United States, and the extinction of the South Vietnamese
government.
   The United States and unified Vietnam have not had normal
diplomatic relations since.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Spina Bifida May Be Preventable by Fetal Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spina bifida, a common and severe birth
defect, may one day be prevented by surgery to patch the fetal
spine inside the womb, a new study indicates.
   The study conducted by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore
suggests spina bifida may result in part from exposure of the
spinal cord to the womb's amniotic fluid, according to Dr. Dan S.
Heffez.
   Heffez, assistant professor of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins,
presented the study's findings Monday to the American Association
of Neurological Surgeons.
   Spina bifida is caused by the failure of the spine and skin to
form over the spinal cord, and the most serious form occurs in an
estimated one of 1,000 births.
   The study showed baby rats were paralyzed if the protective
spinal cord covering was surgically removed while they were still
in the womb. But if skin was sewn over the wound within 24 hours,
the rats were ``entirely normal,'' Heffez said.
   Heffez said spina bifida damage may not occur until the 20th
week of pregnancy, when amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus
changes in a way that may jeopardize an unprotected spinal cord.
   But a hole in the spine can be diagnosed through blood tests and
ultrasounds by the 18th week of pregnancy, and fetal surgery has
been attempted before 20 weeks to correct other problems, Heffez
said.
   Years of research remain before such a procedure could be
attempted on a human fetus, according to Heffez. He said Johns
Hopkins researchers are conducting studies to discover whether the
damage is progressive in humans.
   ``We need first to establish beyond a doubt that in man this is
a progressive problem,'' he said. ``We have to follow (fetal) leg
movements with ultrasound _ something we are trying to do right
now.''
   The damage would be considered progressive if leg movements
diminished over time in fetuses diagnosed with spina bifida, Heffez
said.
   Spina bifida can cause paralysis of the legs, loss of bladder
and bowel functions and a malformed spinal cord. The afflicted can
live into adulthood, but are more susceptible to infections because
of the open wound and hole in their spine. And they require
lifetime care.
   ``The long-term cost is enormous,'' Heffez said. ``I don't think
you can put a number on that cost or on the wasted potential.''

   The six Americans left behind were not
forgotten as Frank Reed's friends and relatives celebrated his
release after 3{ years of captivity in Lebanon.
   ``That's my basic thought of the moment. I want to see everybody
happy as I am now,'' Reed's wife, Fahima, said Monday shortly
before she and the couple's 9-year-old son, Tarek, headed for
Frankfurt, West Germany, to greet him in person.
   Mrs. Reed, her son and other relatives sat glued to a television
in their apartment in this Boston suburb as Reed told Syrian TV
that 42 months as a hostage in Lebanon had been lonely and boring.
   His voice seemed to waver as he said, ``I'd like to tell my
family, especially my son Tarek, that his daddy is well. He is a
little skinny, but he will be home very soon.''
   Leota Sprague, Reed's 91-year-old mother, said she thought her
son ``looks good. I think he looks well.''
   Reed, 57, appeared briefly at a news conference in Damascus
before heading to West Germany for a health check-up and reunion
with his wife and son.
   In Boise, Idaho, the mother of hostage Jesse Turner said she
felt joy for Reed's family and took his release as a good sign.
   ``I was hopeful that it would come to pass,'' Estelle Ronneburg
said. ``Now we're down to six Americans.''
   Peggy Say, whose brother, Terry Anderson of The Associated
Press, is the longest-held hostage, left a message on the answering
machine at her home in Cadiz, Ky., saying she was praying ``that
Frank Reed comes out and that the rest of the hostages follow
shortly.''
   It seemed almost too good to be true for the Reed family.
   ``I never dreamed about this, especially so soon. I was in for a
big surprise,'' Mrs. Reed said.
   After viewing pictures of her husband broadcast on Syrian
television, Mrs. Reed he ``looked better than I expected. I didn't
expect to see him in a suit.''
   One of Reed's two daughters from a previous marriage, Marilyn
Langston, said: ``I can't believe it's finally over. It's been a
long haul. We're thrilled.''
   Reed's brother, Edward, said, ``It's a great day. I feel
wonderful.''
   A picture and an unsigned statement were delivered Sunday to a
newspaper in Lebanon saying Reed would be freed within 48 hours.
The same statement and another picture were also sent to a Western
news agency.
   Three hours after the anonymous statement was delivered, a
previously unknown group calling itself the Organization of Islamic
Dawn sent a statement to an independent newspaper in Lebanon and
claimed responsibility for the first announcement.
   A Malden native, Reed converted to Islam before marrying his
wife. He made two trips to Lebanon before leaving his post as
school principal in Whitefield, N.H., to become director of
elementary education at Beirut's International College in 1977.
   At the time of his abduction Sept. 9, 1986, Reed was running the
private Lebanese International School, which he founded after the
International College had been bombed out.
   After his abduction, a caller to a Western news agency claimed
he was a CIA spy and was taken by Islamic Jihad. That Shiite
fundamentalist organization denied holding him, and other callers
claimed responsibility in the name of the Moslem fundamentalist
Hezbollah and the little-known Resurrection Cells.
   Reed's family called the espionage charge ridiculous.
   Meanwhile, plans were being made for a homecoming gala in the
hometown of Robert Polhill, the hostage who was freed last week.
   A motorcade will wend from Fishkill, N.Y., where Polhill's
mother, Ruth Polhill, lives, to nearby Beacon, where Polhill grew
up, said Fishkill Mayor George Carter. The date is uncertain;
Polhill, 55, who has diabetes, remained under observation at Walter
Reed Army Medical Center in Maryland.
   The scores of yellow ribbons festooned around around Fishkill in
memory of the local hostage will stay up in memory of the remaining
hostages, Carter said.

<HEAD>Convicted Senator to Pay Off 1981 Abscam Fine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former New Jersey Sen. Harrison A. Williams
Jr. has agreed to settle a longstanding debt to the federal
government by paying the $47,000 remaining from his 1981 Abscam
fine for bribery and conspiracy.
   ``We believe by the end of this summer, the senator will be in a
position to have it paid off,'' his attorney said Monday.
   John D. Arsenault said in a telephone interview from his law
office in Roseland, N.J., that the former Democrat always intended
to settle his debt.
   ``Contrary to popular belief, he doesn't have $50,000 laying
around in a closet someplace,'' Arsenault said.
   But the attorney declined to say where the former senator would
find the money to make the payment.
   Dick Lavinthal, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
New Jersey, declined to comment.
   Williams, released from prison for good behavior in 1986, has
been volunteering at a drug crisis center in Newark, N.J.
   He served two years of concurrent two- and three-year sentences
for bribery, conflict of interest and conspiracy in the Abscam
sting.
   In that operation, undercover agents posing as middlemen for
Arab sheiks made a deal with Williams in which he agreed to accept
a hidden interest in a Virginia titanium mine in return for helping
to find military contracts for the venture, according to evidence
from his trial.

<HEAD>US, South Yemen Establish Normal Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has resumed relations with
the leftist government of South Yemen after nearly 21 years.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler on Monday said
the United States seeks ``a useful, productive relationship.''
   South Yemen has had close ties with the Soviet Union and is the
only Arab nation that has pursued Marxist policies. The United
States has accused it of engaging in state-sponsored terrorism.
   Ms. Tutwiler said South Yemen has been intent on maintaining
peaceful relations with its Arabian Peninsula neighbors and has
begun liberalizing its economy and its political system.
   Its record on terrorism also has improved, she said.
   ``We hope to see continued good relations among the countries in
that area contributing to regional stability and further economic
progress,'' she said.
   South Yemen continues to be on a U.S. list of countries that
engage in international terrorism because terrorist organizations
have been allowed to maintain facilities there and South Yemeni
officials have provided refuge for airline hijackers, she said.
   However, a State Department report on terrorism made public
Monday asserts that South Yemen has considerably reduced its
support for terrorism since the early 1980s.

<HEAD>Mitsubishi Recalls 1986 Cars For Pollution Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Environmental Protection Agency says about
102,000 Mitsubishi cars from the 1986 model year are being recalled
because they exceed federal standards for carbon monoxide emissions.
   The cars were equipped with 1.5-liter engines and sold as the
Mitsubishi Mirage, Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt, most of them under
the Dodge and Plymouth nameplates, EPA said Monday.
   Cars sold in California, which has different pollution standards
from the rest of the country, are not affected by the recall, the
EPA said.
   The agency said dealers will modify the carburetor, recalibrate
the automatic choke and check the secondary air filter for possible
replacement. The work will be done without charge.
   The excess pollution was discovered in the agency's routine

<HEAD>Thornburgh Decided to Keep Las Vegas Data Confidential</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has changed
his mind and decided to keep confidential financial data of a
newspaper seeking approval of joint operations with a competitor in
Nevada, a spokesman says.
   The attorney general signed an order reversing his decision of
Feb. 16 requiring the Las Vegas Review-Journal to disclose
circulation and advertising revenue, spokesman David Runkel said
Monday night.
   The publisher, Donrey of Nevada Inc., an arm of closely held
Donrey Media Group, filed a petition March 2 seeking
reconsideration of the February decision.
   Donrey argued that disclosure would damage relations with
customers, suppliers and unions in the 73 markets in 21 states in
which Donrey operates, including Las Vegas.
   The Review-Journal and the Las Vegas Sun in June agreed to merge
their business, circulation and production operations, keeping
separate editorial departments, along the lines of joint operating
agreements in force in 19 other cities.
   Such agreements are permitted if the attorney general finds that
one newspaper is in danger of failing. Both newspapers have said
the Sun is in ``probable danger of financial failure.''

<TEXT>
   Republicans changed their minds and decided
not to put President Bush's $1.2 trillion budget for 1991 to a vote
by the Democratic-controlled House today.
   Admitting he found the decision ``embarrassing,'' Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, the House Budget Committee's ranking
Republican, said he made the decision Monday after consulting with
GOP leaders.
   Nonetheless, it seems to represent a concession that some
Republican lawmakers would prefer not to vote for a Bush budget
that some see as outdated and politically unattractive.
   The House was expected to approve a Democratic alternative today
that spends less on defense and more on domestic programs than the
president desires. The Senate Budget Committee plans to resume its
so-far fruitless search for consensus on a package of its own.
   The GOP's decision to avoid a vote on the president's spending
plan has little practical importance for today's House debate.
Bush's budget was certain to be defeated in the House, where
Democrats outnumber Republicans 258-176.
   ``There's a feeling among Republicans that the budget has been
passed by economic and political events,'' Frenzel said of Bush's
spending plan. ``To debate it is a waste of time. We have to do a
real job based on the realities of the day.''
   Since Bush unveiled his spending plan in January, the economy
has performed more weakly than anticipated and the Soviet bloc's
military threat has deteriorated.
   GOP lawmakers had until now viewed Bush's proposal as a rallying
point and as a bargaining position in what they hope will be future
budget negotiations between the White House and Congress.
   In his budget, Bush proposed spending $303.7 billion for defense
in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. That would be $7 billion more
than this year, but $3.2 billion less than needed for military
programs to stay even with inflation.
   But citing the Warsaw Pact's collapse, House Democrats want to
cut defense to $295.4 billion.
   In further contrast with Bush, Democrats are proposing spending
$224.3 billion on domestic programs ranging from environmental
cleanups to housing aid for the poor. The president seeks $5.6
billion less.
   Republicans have said for weeks that they would oppose the
Democratic package. They argue that without bargaining between Bush
and congressional leaders, any budget would be meaningless because
the president would be sure to veto any cuts he opposes.
   Democrats predicted they had enough votes to adopt their plan,
despite qualms by some of their conservatives that the package is
too harsh to the Pentagon and lacks sufficient deficit reduction.
   The Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law requires a maximum deficit
next year of $64 billion. Under the law's procedures, that would
mean that at least $37 billion in savings must be found. The
Democratic package hits that target, but some lawmakers _ joined by
the administration _ say even more savings are needed because of
the slumping economy.
   In the Senate, Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
has been unable to find enough Democratic votes to adopt a spending
plan. Republicans are opposing all plans offered, arguing that
negotiations between Bush and Congress are necessary.

   Dry conditions and high winds fanned a brushfire
that ravaged more than 5,000 acres of Everglades sawgrass and
continued to burn uncontrollably early today, park and forestry
officials said.
   Lightning apparently sparked the blaze that quickly grew from
about 60 acres Monday, said Pat Tolle, spokeswoman for the
Everglades National Park.
   By early today, the fire had burned about 3,000 acres outside
the park and about 2,000 acres in the park's Taylor Slough area,
which consists of sawgrass wetlands and isolated stands of hardwood
trees, said Forestry Division duty officer Phil DeAngelis.
   ``It's burning in some areas that haven't seen fire as long as
we've been keeping records,'' Ms. Tolle said.
   Drought conditions have left the Everglades so dry that
alligators and wading birds are traveling far from their natural
habitats to find water. Most residents in Central and South Florida
face water restrictions and levels in Lake Okeechobee, which
supplies much of the region's water, have hit record lows.
   No homes or park exhibits were directly threatened by the fire
about four miles southwest of Florida City, but hazy smoke prompted
the Federal Aviation Administration to order planes not to fly
below 2,000 feet in a two-square-mile area around the fire.
   Firefighters from the National Park Service and Florida Division
of Forestry were battling the brushfire with help from a helicopter
crew dumping water, Ms. Tolle said. Crews planned to set backfires
overnight in an attempt to contain the blaze, she said.
   ``It's a real problem fire. We can't just stand back and let it
burn itself out,'' said Forestry Service duty officer John Wagner.
   Park officials, however, had no immediate plans to call in
reinforcements, said Ms. Tolle, who sees some benefit in the blaze.
   ``It has the potential to do quite a lot of good,'' she said.
``Fire is essential to maintaining marsh habitat for wading birds,
and that's basically the type of habitat it's burning through.''

Beirut:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ On the state of his health: ``I feel I'm well in terms of the

government for all their efforts in helping me become a free man.''
   _ On contact with the outside world during his captivity: ``We
had no information that was given to us about who was where, where
we are, who's leaving. We had no nothing. We had no radio. We had
no news. We had no Time, Newsweeks to go by, so we know nothing. In
fact, there were times I really did not even know what month it
was.''
   _ On his refusal of his captives' offer at one point to watch
non-news programs on television: ``I did not want to be entertained
when I had lost my freedom.''
   _ On his treatment during captivity: ``As far as the food goes
that I had, I had adequate food and fresh fruit. I was given an
opportunity to bathe, shower. We were given fresh clothes fairly
regularly, washed and so on.''
   _ On comments that he was blindfolded 24 hours a day during much

   _ On his captivity: ``It was lonely. It was boring.''
   _ On why he was abducted: ``Actually no one ever said why I was
taken. Probably the bottom line was because I was American.''

   The Hubble Space
Telescope, all $1.5 billion of it, is back in working order today
because a NASA engineer used a Tinkertoy, a lamp cord, masking tape
and glue to help solve a major problem.
   The telescope's No. 2 high-gain antenna, wedged in one position
since last Friday, was free and sending data through relay
satellites.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration expected
calibration and other normal start-up work to begin by tonight and
to receive its first pictures from the telescope by next weekend.
   ``The moral of the story is that there is no solution that's too
humble,'' said David Skillman, who built a model of the jammed
antenna.
   ``We were faced with a problem on the telescope that involved
quite intricate geometry,'' he said. ``A number of us realized we
could benefit greatly from a model. Someone suggested that even a
Tinkertoy model could be useful.''
   He drove to a toy store Sunday afternoon and bought two boxes of
the construction toy. He got the other items in a drug store and
put the model together in 15 minutes with another engineer, John
Decker.
   The telescope has two dish-shaped high-gain antennas that are
designed to transmit science data to two orbiting relay satellites
at speeds equivalent to sending the contents of a 30-volume
encyclopedia in 42 minutes.
   The No. 2 antenna jammed on Friday when engineers were turning
it left and right. Sensing something wrong and trying to prevent
damage, the telescope's computer shut down the whole system.
   One engineer noticed that the inch-thick electrical cable on the
back of the antenna was slightly out of position. With that in
mind, they looked at telemetry data for signs that the cable could
interfere with the counterweights when the dish was turned to
certain positions.
   The model that Skillman and Decker built showed that to be the
case and that, in turn, would cause the motors to work too hard and
be automatically halted.
   Troubleshooters had eyed the cable as a possible problem after
studying photographs of the telescope while it still was on the
ground and nestled in the cargo bay of space shuttle Discovery.
   Data from the telescope indicated the dish's position and, said
Skillman, ``when we set the model to angles in the computer screen,
we could see the interference in antenna parts and cable.''
   What they visualized with the model was matched with computer
drawings at Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. in California.
   ``They didn't have the cable in them,'' Skillman said. ``Once we
sketched in the cable, they saw the interference.''
   Armed with that knowledge, computer commands were sent to the
telescope directing exactly the way the dish should move to back
out of its jam.
   ``The antenna moved beautifully and easily out of its problem
and back to normal,'' said Skillman. ``Many times a simple solution
is the best solution.''
   Until, perhaps some day, an astronaut goes to the antenna and
bends the cable out of the way, NASA's solution also is a simple
one. It sent up commands to the telescope's computer ordering it to
avoid the position where it could come in contact with the cable.
   The antennas send their signal to one of two Tracking and Data
Relay Satellites orbiting Earth and store their information on tape
recorders when they are not in communication with the satellites.
Because of that, said Jean Olivier, one of the top NASA officials
on the project, the slight limits on the antenna's movement to
avoid contact with the cable will have only a small impact.

   In a rare revision of Mormon ritual, the
church has dropped wording that required women to pledge to obey
their husbands and portrayed the clergy of other religions as
agents of Satan.
   Women must now vow to obey God rather than their husbands in the
``endowment'' ceremony, a ritual the church teaches is necessary to
enable members to live with God after death. The ceremony is
performed only once for each person, but a member may go through it
countless times as a proxy for those who have died.
   The revised ritual, which took effect last month in ceremonies
performed in the 43 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, is being greeted with enthusiasm by church
members who say it reflects greater sensitivity toward women and
other religions.
   ``The temple is an important part of my spiritual life and the
changes have allowed me to go to the temple with renewed joy,''
said Lavina Fielding Anderson, editor-elect of the Journal of
Mormon History.
   Mormons attending temple were read a statement from the
governing First Presidency informing them of the changes. The
statement said the revisions were unanimously approved by the
three-member body and the advisory Council of the Twelve Apostles.
   Bruce L. Olsen, managing director of the church's communications
office, said church leaders would not comment on the revisions
because temple ceremonies are considered too sacred for public
discussion.
   But some church members praised the changes.
   ``I think we're gradually moving away from the subjugation of
women,'' said Ross Peterson, co-editor of Dialogue, an independent
Mormon journal.
   ``I think (church leaders) are developing a recognition that
there are many highly intelligent, independent, capable and
educated women in our ranks today who have a great deal to offer.''
   Among other changes, a theatrical portion of the ceremony that
included a non-Mormon ``preacher'' paid by Satan to spread false
doctrine has been excised.
   ``The general consensus is that it's a breath of fresh air,''
Peterson said. ``You don't put down other churches or imply that
they are Satan's children.''
   Rebecca England, a member of the planning committee of the
independent Mormon Women's Forum, said the changes may boost temple
attendance.
   ``I know quite a number of Mormons who stopped going to the
temple because they found it demeaning,'' she said. ``And I think
this revised ceremony addresses many of the concerns that they and
I, as a feminist Mormon, have had.''
   Mormon women cannot become priests. Nor can they serve in the
local lay clergy or the church hierarchy.
   The Mormon Church, based on revelations that Joseph Smith said
were brought to him in the 1820s by heavenly messengers, claims to
have 7.3 million members, with the largest concentration of church
members in Utah, California and Idaho.
   The framework of the endowment ritual, apart from editing to its
current length of about 90 minutes and adoption of film to portray
part of the ceremony, has remained mostly intact since Smith's day.
   The endowment ceremony is considered a prerequisite for Mormons'
goal of living with God after death in the ``celestial kingdom,''
the highest stage of glory a church member can achieve.
   The ceremony includes instruction _ in a theatrical setting _ on
creation, Adam and Eve's expulsion from the Garden of Eden and
God's plan of redemption.
   Members usually go through it at young adulthood, before
marriage or prior to embarking on a mission for the church. It also
is performed prior to young males receiving the Melchizedek
priesthood, the church's highest priesthood, at age 19.
   Graphic depictions of penalties for breaking sacred covenants,
considered gruesome by some, also were among the recent deletions.
   ``It's not as harsh,'' Peterson said of the new version. ``It's
more uplifting. It's softer and gentler.''

<HEAD>Thousands of Korean Workers, Radicals Protest Labor Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY SMITH TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of students and
workers at auto plants, subways, shipyards, and broadcast stations
across South Korea took to the streets today to denounce the
government's repression of labor unrest.
   Protests again turned violent in Ulsan, the southeastern port
city where police stormed a shipyard over the weekend to break up a
sit-down strike. About 2,000 workers fought police guarding streets
near the shipyard as thousands of workers and students held rallies
elsewhere in the city.
   In the southern city of Chonju, dozens of radical students armed
with steel pipes and firebombs attacked a building to be used for a
meeting of the governing Democratic Liberal Party, said Yonhap, the
South Korean news agency.
   Students yelling anti-government slogans smashed windows and
furniture, Yonhap said. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   Across the nation, police in riot gear were deployed at college
campuses, government buildings and industrial sites. Protesters are
demanding more freedom to organize labor without government
interference.
   Hundreds of riot police guarded the state-run Korean
Broadcasting System network headquarters, where 2,400 police staged
a midnight raid to end a 19-day protest against a new network
president. Police said 333 workers were arrested.
   The protesters say the new chief has denied them their press
freedoms.
   Protests against the government crackdown on labor organizing
even spilled over to banks. At Citibank in Seoul, tellers protested
by refusing to wear bank uniforms and instead donned T-shirts and
slacks.
   Seoul's Dongguk University closed after its 5,000 students
boycotted classes in sympathy with strikers.
   The capital's subway workers declared a two-day protest against
suppression of labor, refusing to sell tickets and giving
passengers free rides.
   In the KBS raid, police rushed into the broadcast building
holding their shields before them and surrounded the protesters in
the main lobby. The workers locked arms and sang solidarity songs,
swaying from side to side.
   A police lieutenant issued orders through a microphone for
officers to take away the protesters, and police made arrests.
   Workers at the country's only other broadcast network, Munwha
Broadcast Co., walked off the job today to protest the KBS raid.
   ``The government's use of force was inevitable,'' said
Information Minister Choe Byung-yul. ``The government cannot
tolerate the situation that has been causing a serious impact on
our economy and industry.''
   The government has vowed to deal firmly with the outbreak of
labor turmoil, saying it threatens the economy. Strikes, steep wage
increases and the rise of the national currency against the dollar
have hurt the ability of South Korean products to compete abroad.
   Saturday's police raid at the Hyundai conglomerate's shipyard in
Ulsan, the world's largest, has touched off four days of street
battles between police and workers in the city.
   Authorities said 80 policemen and 14 workers have been injured
in the violence and nine workers formally charged with instigating
labor unrest.
   In Ulsan today, about 30,000 workers from affiliated Hyundai
companies rallied at worksites to protest the raid on the shipyard,
news reports said.
   At the Hyundai Motor Co., about 20,000 workers chanting
``Withdraw police forces!'' cheered union leaders who denounced the
use of force to put down the shipyard strike.
   A union leader at the auto plant, the country's largest with
27,000 workers, said labor protests would last until at least May 5.
   The labor unrest is the most serious since 1987, when workers
frustrated by years of repression and low wages and encouraged by
democratic reforms shut down scores of major industries and won
wage increases of about 50 percent.
   However, many workers still live in substandard housing and
receive low pay and union activists are now seeking not merely
higher wages by more power for unions.

   Snow threatened Western high country today and rain was
scattered from the Deep South to New England.
   Rain and snow showers fell over North Dakota and Minnesota. Rain
was scattered from southern California to northwestern New Mexico
and across eastern Colorado.
   A wet spring snow storm that dumped up to 21 inches of snow on
southern Colorado and killed one person let up slightly Monday, but
more snow was on the way, forecasters said.
   Pearl Sutliffe, 58, was found dead about 7:30 a.m. Monday, about
12 hours after she disappeared while trying to round up livestock
with her husband, according to the Park County Sheriff's
Department. Authorities said she was buried in snow and apparently
died of hypothermia.
   A winter storm watch was issued for today for the southwestern
mountains and four corners region of Colorado.
   A winter storm watch also was posted for tonight and Wednesday
for the north central mountains and northeastern highlands of New
Mexico, and a snow advisory was issued for today for the northern
and central mountains of Arizona.
   A gale warning was issued along the northern California coast.
   Thunderstorms rumbled along a warm front curving through
Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee and the Carolinas.
   Rain was scattered from the middle Atlantic Coast to New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms ranged across northwestern Arkansas
and southwestern Missouri.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   The high for the nation Monday was 102 degrees at Presidio,
Texas.
   Record low temperatures were set Monday at International Falls,
Minn., 19 degrees, breaking a record 20 recorded in 1956; and at
Kansas City, Mo., 34 degrees, breaking a record 38 set in 1984.

<HEAD>Eight Covenant House Board Members Have Quit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following the resignation of almost half its
members, the board of directors of the embattled Covenant House
program for runaway youths is trying to reassure donors that the
charity will endure.
   Eight of 17 board members have resigned since the beginning of
the year.
   The resignations came in the wake of a scandal involving the
charity's founder and former leader, the Rev. Bruce Ritter, who
resigned earlier this year amid allegations he had sexual relations
with shelter residents and loaned charity funds to two former board
members.
   Covenant House provides shelter for 25,000 runaway youths in the
U.S., Canada and Central America.
   The shelter's board is investigating all the recent allegations,
reassessing program needs, improving management practices and
trying to solicit donations, officials said.
   They also are searching for a Roman Catholic priest, nun or
brother to replace Ritter, who is believed to be living in
seclusion in New Jersey.
   Since Ritter resigned in February, five new board members have
joined and three seats remain vacant.
   Board Chairman Ralph A. Pfeiffer said that the board generally
left business up to Ritter's judgment.
   ``We wish we had done more and known more,'' said Pfeiffer, a
former chairman of IBM World Trade. ``But we're on the right track
now, and what counts are the kids.''

   Fighting mounting political and labor
turmoil, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is promising to
replace the longtime Sandinista military chief soon and open talks
to disarm Contra rebels.
   The leader of the new U.S.-backed government also said Monday
she is disbanding the secret police, which the leftist Sandinistas
had controlled.
   Mrs. Chamorro, speaking at her first news conference since she
took office last week, also gave an idea of the economic
difficulties she faces.
   She said the Sandinistas had left just $3 million in the
treasury and an $11 billion foreign debt.
   ``That is why it is urgent that we apply severe measures that
will allow us in the short term to stabilize the currency and
prices, to guarantee investment and the productive effort now that
this year's agricultural cycle is starting,'' she said.
   Last week, Mrs. Chamorro devalued Nicaragua's cordoba by about
half. The devaluation sharply increased prices, causing more
hardship in an already poor country.
   Mrs. Chamorro on Wednesday succeeded Daniel Ortega after a
decade of Sandinista rule and nine years of war with U.S.-backed
Contras rebels.
   On Monday, she said she would pursue reform as soon as possible
and appealed for support from both friends and foes.
   Her shaky new government faced new challenges today, with two
labor groups planning separate protests to mark International Labor
Day.
   A Sandinista union has organized a protest to back demands for
100 percent pay raises for all workers and the disbanding of Contra
rebels. Four anti-Sandinista unions were to rally to demand the
removal of Gen. Humberto Ortega as the armed forces chief.
   At her news conference Monday, the president promised that
Ortega, the brother of the former president, will remain only
temporarily as chief of the armed forces.
   She also said she would hold talks Wednesday with Contra
military chief Israel Galeano to ask him to disarm his forces.
   Mrs. Chamorro's decision to serve as her own defense minister
and keep Ortega as commander split her own 14-party United National
Opposition, which she led to a landslide victory in elections Feb.
25.
   The Contras promised to surrender their weapons and disband by
June 10, then balked after Mrs. Chamorro announced that Gen. Ortega
would remain military chief. They say they want an end to
Sandinista control of the military and police.
   At her news conference, Mrs. Chamorro said she understood how
her supporters ``would like a drastic and immediate change'' in the
armed forces. But she added: ``We need to do things well, even if
it means resuming temporary sacrifices to guarantee the tranquility
and stability of the country.''
   She repeated that she had told Gen. Ortega several times his job
was temporary, and she explained she kept him on ``to ensure the
unity and discipline of the army'' while the Contras disarm.
   She announced that the powerful secret police force, which was
run by the Sandinista Interior Ministry, is being disbanded. But
she did not go into details.
   She also said she was ending the use of exit visas, which the
Sandinistas required that both Nicaraguans and foreigners obtain to
leave the country.
   Mrs. Chamorro further appealed to her vice president, Virgilio
Godoy, to remain loyal. He is engaged in a bitter power struggle
with some of her close advisers. On Monday, he was on an
unexplained trip out of the country.
   ``I trust that the vice president ... will accompany and support
me with the total loyalty in the making of the great decisions and
in the fulfillment of the complex tasks with which the people of
Nicaragua have entrusted us,'' she said.

<HEAD>Soviet Gadfly In Good Condition After Surgery For Slipped Disc</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maverick Soviet reformer Boris Yeltsin
was in good condition today after undergoing surgery for a slipped
disc, the doctor who performed the operation said.
   ``His prognosis is frankly very good and we believe his recovery
will be total, although he will have to remain in hospital for
three to five days,'' Dr. Josep Llobet Tapies of Barcelona Hospital
said at a news conference.
   Yeltsin, a member of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies
and a leading populist reformer, arrived in Barcelona late Sunday
to take part in a television debate.
   On Monday, he canceled all activities after complaining of back
pains.
   The doctor said Yeltsin came out of surgery awake and in good
humor, joking with medical staff.
   He said delaying surgery would have risked paralysis of
Yeltsin's right foot. Upon learning this, the Soviet deputy
exclaimed, ``go ahead and operate, a future president of the Soviet
Union cannot have a paralyzed foot,'' Llobet Tapies said.
   Yeltsin, who is seeking the presidency of the Russian Republic,
began to gather mass support in 1987 when he spoke out against what
he considered the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms.
   The criticism cost him his post as Moscow Communist Party chief,
but he re-emerged triumphant in March 1989 with election to the
Congress. This spring, he won election to the legislature of the
Russian republic.

<HEAD>Connecticut Governor Signs Abortion Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. William A. O'Neill has signed into
law a bill designed to guarantee women access to legal abortions
even if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its 1973 landmark Roe vs.
Wade decision.
   The law, effective Oct. 1, repeals the state's unenforced
criminal anti-abortion statutes, requires girls under 16 to get
counseling before getting an abortion and encourages them to tell
their parents.
   O'Neill, a Roman Catholic who has said he personally opposes
abortion, said the law ``strikes a balance between a person's right
to privacy and state interests.''
   The Connecticut law allows abortions late in pregnancy, when the
fetus is capable of living outside the womb, only when the life or
health of the mother is in danger.
   ``It recognizes a right to choice by women. The law also
recognizes the state has an interest in fetus viability and
properly recognizes that minors should be counseled before making
the very difficult decision to abort a pregnancy,'' O'Neill said in
a statement.
   The state's leading anti-abortion group, the Pro-Life Council of
Connecticut, lauded the law because of provisions on counseling and
fetus viability.
   ``This whole thing for us has been a major breakthrough because
before we had nothing,'' said Regina Smith, the executive director
of the council.
   More strident abortion opponents have been critical of the bill.
   ``Pro-life not only didn't get anything, we are in a far worse
position than we were before,'' said Republican state Rep. Anthony
Nania, who voted against the measure and has called for Smith's
ouster.
   The bill cleared the state Senate on Friday on a vote of 32-3.
The House approved the bill the week before on a vote of 136-12.
   The measure has been described as the most aggressive,
abortion-rights piece of legislation since the Supreme Court's
decision last summer in a Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services, gave states greater power to restrict abortions.
   Connecticut's anti-abortion laws were rendered unenforceable by
Roe vs. Wade. They carried penalties of up to five years in prison
and a $1,000 fine for anyone performing an abortion and two years
in prison and a $500 fine for women getting abortions, except to
protect the life of the woman.
   O'Neill was named briefly last summer to a political hit list of
anti-abortion politicians compiled by the National Abortion Rights
Action League. The group quickly took him off the list after
learning that he did not favor significant restrictions on abortion.
   The organization's Kate Michelman called the measure ``a
fantastic bill.''
   ``The passage of this bill absolutely guarantees women of
Connecticut the right to choose,'' she said.
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg vetoed a similar bill earlier this
year, describing it as too liberal.

<HEAD>Exxon Cleanup of Sound Continues With No Word on Chemical Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. assembled summer cleanup
crews to return to the soiled shores of Prince William Sound today
with no word on whether they may use chemicals that encourage
oil-eating bacteria.
   Workers will stop short of using fertilizers until Alaska and
Coast Guard officials decide whether they should be allowed.
   Some state officials worry the chemicals in the fertilizers
could be toxic. Alaska can veto their use, but authority for the
rest of Exxon's cleanup lies with Coast Guard Rear Adm. David E.
Ciancaglini, who has approved parts of the plan.
   State officials hoped to decide today or Wednesday on the
fertilizers, used in a cleanup method called bioremediation, said
Mike Hilley of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.
   The cleanup from Exxon's March 1989 spill of nearly 11 million
gallons of North Slope crude was suspended last September, and
officials monitored conditions through winter.
   The spill was the nation's largest and coated hundreds of miles
of shoreline, killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birds and
other animals.
   Exxon proposed sending eight mobile crews to clean shoreline
still soiled from the spill. Three of the vessels already are at
work in the sound and the Gulf of Alaska. Exxon spokesman Fred
Davis said two more ships were to be launched today and the rest
later in the week.
   Exxon plans to employ about 1,100 people for the summer cleanup
effort, about one-tenth the number it used last summer.
   While the bioremediation debate continues, crews today were to
begin manual pickup and raking at the most ``environmentally
sensitive'' shorelines, Ciancaglini said.
   Top priority will be sites considered important for commercial
fishing and and recreation, officials said.
   Ciancaglini has approved less controversial portions of the oil
company's cleanup plan and said he hoped to make a final ruling on
the rest by May 9.
   Exxon has said its studies of 574 miles of shoreline so far
showed two-thirds without any oil at all, 22 percent with ``very
light oiling'' and 13 percent with a ``narrow to wide band of
weathered crude along sections.''
   The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation said 79
percent of the shoreline sites affected by the spill still had oil.

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies today in early European trading. Gold prices were also
higher.
   Trading was thin with some European markets closed for the May
Day holiday, dealers said.
   They said uncertainty over the direction of West German and U.S.
interest rates will keep markets subdued for the rest of the week.
   However, they said market sentiment is bullish on the dollar.
   ``I'm optimistic for the dollar in the short-term,'' said Hussam

in London.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.18 yen to a closing 158.90 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 158.77 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6827 West German marks, up from 1.6787
   _1.4545 Swiss francs, up from 1.4512
   _5.6430 French francs, up from 5.6335

   _1,232.50 Italian lire, up from 1,230.50
   _1.1645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1649
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6385, compared with 1.6390 dollars late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $368.50 a troy ounce, up
from $367.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $368.95.
   Zurich gold markets were closed today for the holiday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.72 to close at a bid $370.83.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $4.95 a troy ounce, from

   David Letterman helped convict a woman who
broke into his home after she was released from prison for one of
five earlier break-ins there.
   The comedian, host of NBC's ``Late Night With David Letterman,''
told Superior Court Judge Lawrence L. Hauser on Monday that he saw
Margaret Ray's silhouette in the hallway of his New Canaan home
early March 19th.
   ``That's when I first became aware of her on this planet,''
Letterman testified.
   Hauser found Ray, 37, guilty and ordered her to Niantic State
Prison to serve a one-year term, the maximum penalty for the
misdemeanor charge against her, first-degree criminal trespass.
   Ray, of Crawford, Colo., was released from Niantic two days
before her March 19th arrest, having completed seven months of a
nine-month sentence she received for breaking into Letterman's
house last August.

   Centenarian Henry Stenhouse is running
for Congress after watching the country ``disintegrate'' during his
lifetime.
   ``In some respects you've gotta be a little bit off base to want
to do anything for this country,'' said the 100-year-old eye
doctor, making his first electoral bid. ``But doggone it, God has
saved me for something. I feel like it's an obligation.''
   Early April found the ophthalmologist up to his elbows in
correspondence. He was trying to reach all the registered
Republicans in the 3rd Congressional District in time for the May 8
primary against two opponents.
   ``This is the doggonedest thing,'' he said with a sigh. ``I
don't think we'll get it all done. I didn't dream that there was as
many people registered Republicans. We've got pages and pages,
boxes full of them. I don't think we're half through.''
   When Stenhouse filed for Congress, he was the lone Republican in
the race. Despite the longshot odds of winning, Stenhouse said he
isn't worried about competing with two primary opponents who
emerged later _ businessman Don Davis, 60, and oil heater repairman
Ken Brosman, 39.
   The winner will face Democratic Rep. Martin Lancaster, who is
seeking a third term in a district that hasn't had a GOP
congressman since Reconstruction.
   Stenhouse's suit is well-worn, his tie threadbare and his
shoulders stooped, but he holds his head erect and his pale blue
eyes constantly dart about. He shuns the seat belt in his car as
another example of ``too damned much government.''
   His plaform?
   He's opposed to welfare, wants to rewrite the U.S. tax code to
levy a flat tax on everyone and expects women to stay home if they
have children, instead of putting them in subsidized day care.
   ``The children of this country, to start with they don't get
discipline. Their homes are broken up,'' he said. ``And here we are
paying women to breed and that is absolutely out for me.''
   Stenhouse said children were not always neglected.
   ``In a lifetime, I have seen this country disintegrate,'' he
said. ``When I got home from school, my momma was there waiting for
me. I'd say, `Well, momma, I'd like to go play. ... And she'd say,
All right, go for half an hour.' What kind of trouble can you get
in in a half hour?''
   Aside from mailing fliers, Stenhouse does little campaigning.
   He thought about taking a poll, ``but in the confusion of all
this I forgot it.''
   He also spurned an opportunity to address a church congregation:
``They asked me to make a speech, but I said, `No way, I don't work
on Sunday.'''
   Yet the campaign has taken on a sense of destiny for Stenhouse,
who hopes to shake up an entrenched Congress. ``You can't do it in
a year. You can't do it in a lifetime. But I think we ought to
start to pull in the reins,'' he said.
   And if he loses?
   ``If I don't win, I don't know what I'll do,'' he said. ``Maybe
sit around this house, huh? But I've got a farm, and that is enough
to keep me busy.''

   A pale but energetic Frank Reed,
the second American hostage freed in nine days, checked into a U.S.
military hospital today and celebrated the end of his captivity
with a beer and a large steak.
   Doctors said the 57-year-old educator, who said he was kept
blindfolded for much of his 3{-year ordeal, was ``weak and tired''
but otherwise feeling well and was reunited with his wife and
9-year-old son.
   Reed blew kisses, waved and kissed his hand and touched the
ground after arriving in brilliant, sunny weather at nearby
Rhein-Main Air Base from Syria on a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport
plane.
   He stepped off the plane looking sprightly and waving the ``V''
for victory sign but looked tired after arriving by helicopter at
the hospital for the medical tests and debriefing that have become
a rite for freed hostages.
   Reed was released Monday night into Syrian hands in west Beirut,
just as Robert Polhill was last week. There was no doubt that Iran,
which backs the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist hostage-takers, had
again played a role.
   The white-bearded former captive was driven to the Syrian
capital of Damascus, where he described a ``lonely and boring''
ordeal in which he was treated reasonably well but kept ignorant of
his fate.
   ``We'd know nothing,'' Reed told a crowded news conference in
Damascus. ``We had no radio. We had no news. We had no Time, no
Newsweek to go by. In fact, there were times when I did not even
know what month it was.''
   The remarks implied that Reed, who was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986,
was held with other hostages but he would not elaborate.
   In Washington, President Bush thanked Syria and Iran for their
help.
   He encouraged them to help free the six Americans among 16
Westerners still believed held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem fundamentalists, saying that only then can those countries
expect normalized relations with Washington.
   A leading Iranian newspaper, the Tehran Times, said today that
Iran's leaders expect a reciprocal gesture of good will from
Washington if another hostage is to be freed. That sentiment was
echoed in Damascus by Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
   Bush said he would not object if Israel were to release Shiite
prisoners as the Lebanese kidnappers have demanded.
   In a statement issued four hours after his arrival at the Air
Force hospital, doctors said Reed had lost ``significant weight and
muscle mass from a lack of exercise and a marginal diet'' during
his captivity. It said he was also ``weak and tired'' but
``otherwise feels well.''
   It said a preliminary examination in Damascus found ``no major
medical problems,'' adding that Reed would probably be at the
hospital for two or three days and did not wish to meet with
reporters today.
   Reed was reunited with his Syrian Moslem wife, Fahima, 39, and
their son, Tarek, who had arrived from the United States, where
they had been staying in his hometown of Malden, Mass.
   He asked for a ``Heineken (beer) and a large steak cooked medium
rare... and ``got what he asked for,'' the statement said.
   The freed hostage, who had been principal of a private school in
Beirut since 1977, was to undergo further medical tests as well as
questioning by a special State Department team.
   Before leaving Syria, Reed told state television that he was
blindfolded 24 hours a day during much of his captivity.
   ``I feel odd that my blindfold is not here,'' he said in a husky
voice, touching his face.
   Reed's kidnappers, who called themselves the Organization of the
Islamic Dawn in a Sunday announcing that Reed would be released,
had said he would carry a message to the U.S. government.
   The freed hostage would not comment on the message.
   Polhill's former captors had said he would also be carrying a
message, and Polhill delivered that undisclosed message to Bush
personally on Monday about the time of Reed's release. Polhill was
the first American hostage to be freed in Lebanon since November
1986.
   Reed said he hoped the other hostages will be freed soon,
constantly using the plural to describe conditions of his captivity.
   He said he had adequate food and fresh fruit and that ``we were
given fresh clothes fairly regularly, washed and so on.
   ``Our problem was the passage of endless time ... We were given
lots of books and allowed to watch TV but never the news.''
   However, he said: ``I refused the books and TV. I didn't want to
be entertained when I lost my freedom.''
   He said on TV of his captivity, ``It was lonely. It was boring.''
   Reed spoke haltingly at times, his eyes downcast. ``I haven't
talked much'' as a hostage, he explained.
   The Tehran Times, which often reflects the thinking of Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said today that Iran and the
militants in Lebanon now expect Washington and its allies to
pressure Israel into releasing a ``significant number'' of
detainees, specifically Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid.
   Obeid is a Shiite cleric with the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah.
He was abducted by Israel from south Lebanon on July 28, 1989.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for
factions holding most of the hostages in Lebanon.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Arriving at the Wiesbaden hospital, Reed gave the ``thumbs-up''
sign and smiled to reporters, waving with both hands
enthusiastically to about 170 military and medical personnel
gathered on hospital balconies.
   ``Welcome back to the free world,'' said one banner outside the
hospital.

<HEAD>Junk Food or Jobs? School Board Ends Snack Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The school board weighed jobs with junk food
and voted on the side of potato chips and pop.
   The Los Angeles Unified School District decided unanimously
Monday to end a 10-year-old ban on junk food as a way to counter
cuts in federal food subsidies.
   ``I'm ashamed of what happened tonight, but we really don't have
a choice,'' board member Roberta Weintraub said after vote. ``It's
a question of jobs versus junk food.''
   A $10 million deficit in the district's cafeteria fund and the
prospect of laying off more than 100 cafeteria workers prompted an
end to the ban, officials said.
   The school board hopes several million dollars a year will be
generated through the sale of junk food in school cafeterias. Also,
lunch prices will be increased by 10 cents for some elementary
students and 25 cents for some junior high and high school students
to increase revenue.
   The price increases will not affect the estimated 80 percent of
the district's students who come from low income families and
qualify for free or reduced price meals.
   School board members said a policy that allowed student-run
stores on campuses to sell snacks undercut the cafeteria ban.
   ``That destroyed our junk food policy,'' Ms. Weintraub said.
``When kids could walk down the hall and buy candy and Coke during
lunch time, we couldn't keep them in the cafeteria.''

<HEAD>Eastern Europe Celebrates May Day Free of Communist Ritual</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Europe quietly celebrated its
liberation from decades of Communist ritual on May Day,
substituting music festivals and picnics for the proletarian
parades of the past.
   In Moscow, a brief burst of the popular rage that swept
Communist leaders from power across Eastern Europe erupted in Red
Square, where the traditional parade was open to all for the first
time in decades.
   Columns of demonstrators taunted Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and other top leaders with cries of ``Shame!'' They
unfurled yellow, red and green Lithuanian flags and shouted
anti-Kremlin slogans.
   With their Stalinist leaders already overthrown, thanks in part
to Gorbachev's reforms, East Europeans rejoiced peacefully in their
new freedom to mark May Day as they wish.
   In Budapest, thousands of people turned out for a giant trade
union picnic in the city's biggest park. In Prague, where the
short-lived joy of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms produced a raucous
May Day parade in 1968, crowds gathered to welcome back U.S.
activist Allen Ginsberg, crowned unofficial King of the festivities
22 years ago but then expelled by the Communists.
   Ginsberg arrived in Prague a few days ago to return his 1968
crown and enjoy a rock fest that also will be briefly addressed by
President Vaclav Havel.
   Romanians continued a 10-day protest in Bucharest calling for
the resignation of interim President Ion Iliescu because of his
Communist past. They prepared for rallies in at least two other
cities.
   Despite its association with Communist rule, the May Day holiday
has deep popular roots across much of eastern Europe, where strong
socialist traditions predate Stalinism.
   ``The meaning of May Day changed in step with history,'' Polish
President Wojciech Jaruzelski noted in a statement. ``But the
tradition of a workers' celebration of this day has been deeply
rooted in our Polish customs.''
   ``Even Western countries such as France still celebrate May
Day,'' Romanian government spokesman Cristian Unteanu noted when
asked why the holiday was not abandoned. ``It's a perfectly normal
holiday.''
   The common traditions of western and eastern Europe found
symbolic expression in May Day celebrations in West Berlin, where a
crowd of 60,000 outside City Hall included thousands of East
Berliners who came through the Brandenburg Gate.
   Communist parties were reduced to a minor role in the
festivities.
   In Czechoslovakia, where the Communist Party still claims more
than 1 million members, leader Vasil Mohorita told a rally of some
20,000 people the party hoped for more than 10 percent of the votes
in next month's democratic elections.
   Hungary's Communists, roundly defeated at the polls last month,
ran a single beer stand at the city picnic that marked the 100th
anniversary of a demonstration for an eight-hour work day. That
still eludes many Hungarians, who often work two or three jobs to
make ends meet.
   Tiny, isolated Albania was the only country to see more orthodox
celebrations.
   The state news agency ATA quoted Communist leader Ramiz Alia as
reiterating his refusal to follow the reforms of the East Europeans.
   ``They are heading into a blind alley,'' he reportedly told a
workers' rally. ``(They are) jumping out of the frying pan into the
fire.''
   In China, which unlike other Communist countries never had a
tradition of giant May Day parades, a holiday mood prevailed in
Beijing.
   But an armed police cordon around Tiananmen Square's monument to
revolutionary heroes reflected official determination to avoid any
repeat of the pro-democracy demonstrations that spread from there
last spring to much of the country, before being brutally
suppressed.
   Elsewhere in Asia, hundreds of thousands of Japanese workers
gathered at May Day rallies and heard promises of shorter working
hours. In the Philippines, at least 24,000 people rallied near the
U.S. Embassy in a rally called by militant labor groups to protest
U.S. military bases in the country.

   Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher has been
released from a clinic, nearly a week after he underwent surgery to
remove a malignant brain tumor, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Maher, 74, was in good spirits upon his release Monday from
Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, Scripps spokeswoman Sue Pondrom said.
   In a prepared statement, Maher said he believed an outpouring of
prayers in his behalf helped him in a ``miraculous recovery.''
   Maher was admitted to the hospital April 23 after complaining of
vision problems and a loss of equilibrium. He underwent surgery
April 25.
   Physicians said they removed 75 percent to 80 percent of the
brain tumor, which was later determined to be malignant.
   Pondrom said Maher would soon undergo radiation therapy as an
outpatient. The therapy is designed to suppress or retard a
recurrence of the tumor.
   Maher, bishop of the San Diego Diocese since 1969, is scheduled
to retire July 1, when he reaches the mandatory retirement age of
75. Church officials have said they hope he can continue his
official duties until then.
   He will be succeeded by Coadjutor Bishop Robert H. Brom, former
bishop of Duluth, Minn.
   Maher, who oversees the 462,000-member diocese encompassing San
Diego and Imperial counties, drew nationwide attention last year
when he banned Lucy Killea, then a California Assemblywoman running
for state senate, from receiving Communion because of her
pro-choice abortion views.

   Thousands of protesters in Red Square booed and
jeered President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other leaders today,
turning the May Day workers' march into an unprecedented attack on
the ruling elite.
   For the first time, tens of thousands of unofficial
demonstrators were permitted onto the square following the official
march.
   Some protesters unfurled dozens of yellow, red and green flags
of secessionist Lithuania and shouted ``Shame!'' at the leaders,
who were standing atop Lenin's mausoleum.
   Gorbachev and other officials on the reviewing stand left after
enduring the unofficial demonstrations for about 20 minutes. Some
protesters booed and jeered as the leaders left, and shouted,
``Resign!'' Festive music blared through loudspeakers around the
square, making the shouting only barely audible.
   It was not clear whether Gorbachev and the others left because
of the huge outpouring of criticism, unprecedented on Red Square
even in the country's tense political atmosphere.
   During the protest, Gorbachev appeared impassive but was seen
tapping his fingers on the parapet of the reviewing stand, as he
often does when he is impatient.
   For decades, the Red Square rally on May Day has been an
orchestrated show of support for official policies.
   A subway worker attending the parade as an official guest said
he was stunned.
   ``A revolution is a revolution. What else can I say?'' said the
worker, who identified himself only as Yuri.
   At least one marcher today carried the Soviet flag with the
hammer and sickle cut out. Another sign called Soviet leaders ``The
Kremlin Ceausescus,'' after the executed Romanian dictator. Others
said ``Down with the Empire of Red Fascism,'' and ``Today a
Blockade of Lithuania, Tomorrow a Blockade of Moscow.''
   The protest was not shown on state-run television, which ended
its transmissions after the official march.
   The wave of angry protesters continued to file through Red
Square, which holds about 50,000 at a time, for more than an hour
after the leaders left. Police gradually, and apparently gently,
moved them along. A few thousand trekked about a mile to a square
across from Gorky Park to renew their demonstration.
   Similar expressions of discontent were seen in Leningrad, the
Soviet Union's second largest city and the birthplace of the
revolution. Protesters sprinkled among pro-government marchers on
Palace Square carried banners that read, ``Communism is a Universal
Shame'' and ``Freedom for Lithuania,'' according to Leningrad
journalist Maxim Korzhov.
   Some demonstrators, he said, shouted, ``Gorbachev Resign!''
   Soviets are upset with Gorbachev because of the deteriorating
state of the economy. Consumer goods are scarce and of poor quality.
   They also are critical of him for championing democratic reforms
but not submitting his own leadership to a test at the polls.
Gorbachev was elected by lawmakers last month to a powerfully
expanded executive presidency, and critics say it puts a dangerous
amount of power into the hands of a single leader.
   The 59-year-old Soviet leader is also engaged in a bitter
dispute with Lithuania over its independence drive, and Moscow has
imposed a blockade on many raw materials, manufactured goods and
food.
   Many Soviet adherents of democracy say Gorbachev should let the
Lithuanians restore the sovereignty they lost in 1940 when the
Soviet Union forcibly annexed the Baltic state.
   Gorbachev and the leadership were not immune from criticism
during the official segment that came before the protest.
   Labor leaders speaking from atop Lenin's mausoleum demanded
attention to their worries that economic reforms will lead to high
prices and unemployment.
   The May Day celebration, a major Soviet holiday, comes as the
country faces secessionist demands in several of its 15 republics
and economic deterioration. Government statistics show industrial
production to have fallen by 1.2 percent in the first quarter. One
any given day during the period, 130,000 people were on strike.
   ``The basic reason for the crisis situation is that the
leadership of the party and the government have been chronically
late in putting into effect cardinal political and economic
measures,'' said Yevgeny Kablov, a technology researcher chosen to
speak to a 30-minute rally before the traditional parade.
   Yevgeny Kuznetsov, a union leader at the city's giant Hammer and
Sickle steel mill, said planned moves to a market economy would
hurt workers.
   ``Many wise men of economics are calling us to plunge headlong
into a market economy, trusting in our luck,'' he said. ``But we
won't be able to trust our luck if we don't beforehand take into
account the consequences: growth in prices, a fall in the standard
of living, and unemployment.''
   The speeches from the mausoleum were met with less than
enthusiastic applause.
   Gorbachev led government and Communist Party Politburo leaders
onto the reviewing stand before the proceedings. In keeping with
efforts to emphasize the government over the party, he was
accompanied by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Anatoly I. Lukyanov,
chairman of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Neither Gorbachev nor any other member of the Party or
government leadership on the reviewing stand spoke at the rally.
   Also on the stand was newly elected Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov,
a reform-minded economist highly critical of Gorbachev.
   Popov's supporters on the city council are pushing to turn much
of the capital's retail trade into private hands.
   Gorbachev and his advisers began meeting a month ago to plan
economic reforms that are expected to include the most radical
economic reforms attempted in the Soviet leader's more than five
years in power.
   But Gorbachev's economic advisers acknowledge they can proceed
with reforms only as fast as beleaguered consumers will permit.

   A plastics plant fire forced evacuation of
about 2,000 people after an emergency fire plan burned and left
officials unsure of what to do, the sheriff says.
   Nearby residents were allowed to return home once tests found
the air safe following the fire Monday at the Life-Like Plastics
plant.
   The blaze produced a cloud of black, toxic smoke that could be
seen 12 miles away. Officials said the smoke forced the evacuation
of 1,400 Ozark public school students, a nursing home and 350
students at a vocational-technical school.
   Franklin County Sheriff Gordon McCain said the cause of the fire
was not known. The fire destroyed the plant and the damage was
expected to run into the millions of dollars, he said. There were
no injuries.
   The plant made polystyrene packaging materials, plant manager
Gary Key said. He said some of the products are made of pentane
gas, the material that most concerned emergency workers.
   ``This stuff is not real toxic,'' McCain said. ``At first they
thought it was. What happened is, the records of what to do in case
of fire were in (the plant) and they burned up. They ended up not
knowing what to do.''
   State police spokesman Mack Hayden said officials contacted ARCO
Chemical Co. of Newtown Square, Pa., for information about
polystyrene, which the chemical company manufactures.
   Officials were told that polystyrene was the main concern in the
fire, Hayden said, adding the polystyrene poses slight inhalation
problems, eye irritation and skin irritation.
   The Ozark Fire Department and a hazardous materials team from
Fort Chaffee entered the ruins of the fire-gutted plant Monday
afternoon wearing air masks, Hayden said. They erected a dike to
stop molten chemicals from running out of the 52,000-square-foot
plant and into nearby Gar Creek, officials said.

   Human remains found in a wooded area have
been identified as those of a Harvard graduate student missing
since 1981, officials said.
   A state forensic dentist used jaw and teeth bones to identify
the remains as belonging to Joan Webster, who was last seen at
Logan International Airport on November 28, 1981, Essex County
District Attorney Kevin M. Burke.
   ``The cause of death has been determined to have been blunt
trauma to the head,'' said Burke, following the report Monday from
Dr. Robert Beliveau, pathologist.
   Burke said the case was ruled a homicide.
   Webster, 25 when she disappeared, had just returned to Boston
from a Thanksgiving visit with family members in New Jersey.
   Authorities have no suspects in the case, Burke said. He said
Webster's remains will be turned over to her family when the
investigation is complete.
   The bones were unearthed along with a 15-inch serpentine gold
chain and a gold amethyst ring. Last week, a few feet from
Thursday's discoveries, investigators located a skull, vertebra,
leg and arm bones.

   President Bush dunked, cycled, volleyed and
chipped his way around the White House lawn today to kick off
National Physical Fitness and Sports Month.
   The president, joined by his national fitness czar, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis
Sullivan, hosted the ``Great American Workout'' with a bevy of
sports and entertainment celebrities who demonstrated their
specialties at sports stations set up on the South Lawn.
   Bush encouraged all Americans to get in shape, saying, ``Today
we're declaring war on couch potatoes.''
   ``No matter what your age, sex or physical condition, the Great
American Workout can enhance the quality and longevity of each
American's life,'' he said.
   Bush joked that Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder and actor he
appointed to head the President's Council on Physical Fitness and
Sports, ``is stronger than I thought he was. He bench-pressed the
federal budget.''
   Bush, clad in open-necked shirt and blazer, watched as assorted
youth groups, Special Olympics participants, celebrities and
athletes demonstrated such activities as aerobic dance, martial
arts, basketball, tennis and golf.
   The president pedaled a Life Cycle, shot a basket and missed,
dunked one and made it when the basket was lowered to just above
his head, and practiced golf chip shots.
   Turning to his favorite sports, he tossed a few horseshoes and
hit a few tennis balls with pro player Pam Shriver.
   The sports stations were built on plywood platforms, outfitted
with weight machinery and nets, and equipment for football,
basketball, golf, aerobic fitness, school-physical fitness, Special
Olympics, weight-training, gymnastics, Life Cycle and Life Step,
military training and martial arts.
   It seems Bush has never met a sport he didn't like. At age 65,
he plays golf in the rain, jogs 10-minute miles, pitches horseshoes
and still unlimbers his tennis racket regularly _ albeit usually at
doubles.
   Among today's participants were: Olympic decathlon champions
Bruce Jenner and Rafer Johnson; Olympic track stars Carl Lewis and
Jackie Joyner Kersee, ice skaters Scott Hamilton and Dorothy
Hammill; tennis pros Pam Shriver and Arthur Ashe; football stars
Eric Dickerson of the Indianapolis Colts and Charles Mann of the
Washington Redskins; fitness dean Jack LaLanne and Kevin Nealon,
who's ``Saturday Night Live'' caricature of Schwarzenegger has
popularized the line ``I want to pump you up.''
   Country star Randy Travis sang for the gathering.
   Schwarzenegger said that the idea was ``to show you that fitness
is fun and fitness is for everyone.''
   Taking off on Bush's campaign line ``Read my lips, no new
taxes,'' Schwarzenegger had a new line of his own: ``Read my hips,
no more flab.''
   The month of May has been officially designated fitness and
sports month since 1983.

   The hunk flunked ... again.
   John F. Kennedy Jr., who's made magazine covers touting him as
sexy and an heir to the Kennedy dynasty, took the state bar
examination for a second time. Again, he failed.
   So, today's New York tabloids had front-page headlines screaming
about him going belly up on the bar exam.
   Undaunted, he said he would take the test again and again
``until I'm 95'' _ or until he passes.
   But the 29-year-old son of the late President Kennedy has only
one more chance to pass the grueling 12{-hour, two-day test if he
wants to keep his job as an assistant district attorney in
Manhattan.
   ``I'm clearly not a major legal genius,'' he told a news
conference Monday.
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, said Kennedy, a prosecutor since August, will be
asked to resign from his $30,000-a-year post if he fails again.
   ``All assistants get three chances,'' Roche said. ``It's a
longstanding office policy. He will take it again in July.''
   Kennedy fell 11 points short of the passing score of 660 out of
1,000 points, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kennedy, a graduate of the New York University Law School, first
took the bar exam last July with 64 other new members of
Morgenthau's staff, Roche said. Of the 65, she said, Kennedy was
one of seven who flunked.
   He took the test again in February along with those who failed.
Of the seven, at least two passed on the second go-round.

   Bethlehem has become the latest city to
require high school students to perform community service in order
to graduate.
   The school board voted 6-3 Monday to require the Class of 1994
to perform 60 hours of community service after school, on weekends
and in the summer.
   At the meeting, school board President Joseph McCarthy said the
proposal was ``poorly thought out.''
   But board member Robert Thompson said the measure would
encourage students to have an ``active concern'' for the community.
   ``With the coming generation of adults we need to enunciate
clearly a new set of values, in contradiction to the consumer ideal
of happiness and fulfillment,'' Thompson said.
   In approving the requirement, Bethlehem followed the lead of a
growing number of cities that have adopted some form of community
service standard in the past several years.
   In 1983, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching
issued a report calling for students to perform at least 120 hours
of community service during their four years in high school.

<HEAD>Former Houston Police Officer Receives Seven-Year Sentence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Houston police officer was sentenced to
seven years in prison for shooting a black motorist to death, and
the victim's sister said she was satistifed with the outcome of the
racially charged case.
   Alex Gonzales, 25, was sentenced Monday in the Oct. 31 killing
of Ida Lee Delaney, a 50-year-old newspaper janitor. He was
convicted Friday of voluntary manslaughter and could have faced up
to 20 years in prison.
   Janice Myles, Ms. Delaney's sister, said she was pleased with
the sentence. But she said Gonzales is still better off than her
sister.
   ``You know she's gone,'' Ms. Myles said. ``The only thing I can
do is go talk to her at her grave. But they can go visit him.''
   Mike Howard, president of the Houston Police Patrolman's Union,
said he was disgusted by the jury's verdict.
   ``It's an indictment on the whole police department,'' Howard
said. ``The line has been drawn and we're going to fight this.''
   Gonzales' attorney, Mike Hinton said: ``This is not good for
off-duty officers to now be thinking that they can be confronted
with the sort of ordeal that Alex Gonzales encountered.''
   Gonzales, who is free on bond, will appeal the verdict.
   He and fellow off-duty officers Robert Gonzales, who is
unrelated, and Alexander Romero were returning from a birthday
celebration when they encountered Ms. Delaney on a freeway about
5:30 a.m. They said Ms. Delaney cut in front of their unmarked car
and later fired shots at them.
   During a 12-mile chase, Ms. Delaney pulled her truck over to the
side of the road, near a highway department vehicle, apparently
seeking help.
   She fired at Gonzales after he ran to her truck, gun in hand,
and punched her in the face, a road maintenance worker testified.
Critically wounded, he returned gunfire, killing her.
   Gonzales was intoxicated at the time of the shooting. Tests
showed he had a blood-alcohol level of .19, nearly twice the amount
to be considered legally drunk in Texas.
   The case sparked protests from blacks and other community
leaders both in Houston and in Dallas who said they did not think
an all-white jury would convict Gonzales.
   Charlotte Ragsdale, a member of the Ida Delaney Justice
Committee, said the sentence ``is at least a step in Dallas.''
   ``Obviously, there was enough information and evidence to bring
some form of justice and that was critical in my opinion,'' Ms.
Ragsdale said. ``The family was looking for hope in the system in
they were able to find it.''

<HEAD>Dalai Lama: Lifting of Martial Law Was Public Relations Ploy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dalai Lama said today that China's
lifting of martial law in his homeland was a ``public relations
exercise.''
   In a statement issued by his New Delhi office, the Tibetan
spiritual leader said the problems of Tibet will never be resolved
``through intimidation and superficial changes.'' He called for a
fundamental change in how Chinese leaders view Tibet.
   China imposed martial law in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa on
March 8, 1989, after three days of anti-Chinese rioting. The
government claimed 16 people died, but Tibetan and Western
travelers said about 30 were killed.
   The rioting marked the fourth time since 1987 that Communist
Chinese security forces moved to crush anti-Chinese uprisings.
   The Dalai Lama, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his
advocacy of peaceful resistance in Tibet, said the lifing of the
martial law Monday ``was a public relations exercise in view of the
growing international criticism'' of China.
   He said that over the weekend, a large public trial was held in
Lhasa. Quoting an official Radio Lhasa report, he said 43 Tibetans
were publicly tried and sentenced on ``vague criminal charges.'' He
claimed the trial was conducted to intimidate Tibetans before the
lifting of martial law.
   Human rights agencies, including the London-based Amnesty
International and the U.S.-based Asia Watch, have condemned China
for alleged human rights abuses in Tibet. China has been accused of
torturing Tibetans and denying them basic rights, such as that of
free assembly and religion.
   Countries have limited themselves to urging restraint on the
Chinese because all of them back China's claims to sovereignty over
the vast Himalayan region.
   Many Tibetans resent Chinese rule and reject China's claims that
Tibet has been part of China since the 13th century.
   The Dalai Lama, who fled to India after an aborted uprising in
1959, has called for an autonomous Tibet where Beijing would still
control defense and foreign relations.
   China has rejected the proposal, saying the Dalai Lama is trying
to subvert national unity.
   In his statement, the Dalai Lama urged Beijing to negotiate with
Tibetans on the future of Tibet.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of East Germans marked their first
free May Day with protests against the widespread joblessness they
fear will be the price of unification with West Germany.
   Border guards dispensed with passport checks as crowds of people
carrying balloons, beer and bratwurst swarmed back and forth
through new openings in the Berlin Wall.
   Nearly 60,000 Germans from both sides of the border crowded
around the Reichstag, the former parliament building on the West
German side of the Wall. They heard speakers demand employment and
social service protection as East Germany moves from a socialist
economy to the free market.
   Economists have predicted that 500,000 to 2 million East Germans
could lose their jobs as inefficient state-owned enterprises are
closed and others are forced to compete with Western businesses.
   But West Germans as well have expressed fears about the economic
impact of unification.
   ``Unemployment will be bad in both countries. As factories close
in the East, the East Germans will come here and compete for jobs
with West Germans,'' said Claudia Gerlach, a 27-year-old West
Berliner.
   West German labor leaders, meanwhile, warned that Western
businesses may seek to move to the East to take advantage of lower
wages.
   While some Germans rallied against unemployment, hundreds of
thousands of others enjoyed the warm spring day at a huge May Day
festival on East Berlin's main avenue, Unter den Linden.
   Only a few thousand gathered in another part of town for a rally
held by the former Communist Party, a retooled group now calling
for democratic socialism.
   Thousands of extra police were put on duty in both East and West
Berlin to guard against the rampages by radicals and hooligans that
occur annually in West Berlin on May Day evening. With the newly
opened borders, authorities feared the mayhem would spread to the
East.
   No violence was reported.
   May Day rallies were held in cities in both Germanys, with calls
for job protection the central theme of each gathering.

explore two War of 1812-era wrecks let schoolchildren across North
America in on the expedition.
   The underwater look Monday at the merchant schooner Hamilton and
its sister ship, the Scourge, was televised live to 13 museums.
Four youngsters watching got to operate the robot using a computer
joystick hooked up by satellite.
   The cold, fresh water of Lake Ontario and the 300-foot depth of
the wrecks helped preserve the two ships, which were pressed into
battle service by the United States during the War of 1812.
   Cannons, railings and an elegantly carved figurehead could be
seen as the black-and-white television image panned slowly.
   Robert D. Ballard, the expedition's leader, and other scientists
gave a running narration and took questions from viewers at the
museums in the United States and Canada and at the Canadian
Football Hall of Fame in Hamilton, a city 25 miles west of St.
Catharines that has title to the wrecks.
   ``The ship is in immaculate condition. We can see the caulking
in the planks,'' Ballard said. ``There's no suggestion that they
suffered any damage due to the sinking itself. They just got
flooded and went down very gently.''
   The Hamilton and the Scourge sank during a storm Aug. 8, 1813,
killing 53 sailors. They had taken part in several battles against
British forces in southern Canada.
   However, the wrecks narrowly escaped damage from large ships
that dragged their anchors across the lake bottom, Ballard said. He
said the furrows caused by the anchors were plainly visible near
the wrecks.
   The wrecks remained undisturbed six miles off St. Catharines, 30
miles south of Toronto on the lake's southern shore, until their
discovery in 1975. Since then, scientists such as French underwater
explorer Jacques Cousteau have used submarines and remote cameras
to explore them, but Ballard's expedition was the most
technologically sophisticated yet.
   In an interview by ship-to-shore telephone, Ballard said the
children's participation was the most significant part of the
program. He said the remote control setup had never been used
before.
   Ballard said the two-week expedition would produce a detailed
map of the wrecks that Hamilton officials could use in deciding
whether to raise them someday.
   Ballard, director of the Center for Marine Exploration at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, led the 1985
expedition that discovered the wreck of the Titanic. The storied
ocean liner sank in the North Atlantic after ramming an iceberg in
1912.
   The museums taking part in the program were in Boston; Chicago;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt
Lake City; Sarasota, Fla.; Toronto; Victoria, British Columbia;
Washington; and Woods Hole, Mass.

   Three St. John's University students pleaded
innocent to charges of sexually assaulting a female student who
said she passed out after being forced to down spiked drinks.
   Walter Gabrinowitz, 21, a senior; Andrew Draghi, 20, a junior;
and Michael Calandrillo, 20, a junior, all of Bethpage were
arraigned Monday on charges of sodomy, sexual abuse, sexual
misconduct and unlawful imprisonment.
   They were released to the custody of their parents and suspended
by the university on the same day. Gabrinowitz and Draghi are on
the university's lacrosse team. Calandrillo is in the rifle club,
as is the alleged victim.
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Reese said the incident
occurred March 1, after the woman accepted a ride with Calandrillo
from evening target practice.
   Calandrillo stopped at the house he shared with the other two,
asked the victim in to meet his roommates, then forced her to have
two drinks despite her insistence that she needed to get home to
study, Reese said.
   The woman said she passed out and found Calandrillo and his
housemates sexually abusing her when she intermittently regained
consciousness.
   Reese said the woman was carried from the house and driven to a
second home where she was further abused until a witness intervened
and drove her home.
   Martin J. Healy, a spokesman for St. John's, said the woman on
March 5 confided to a campus minister, who eventually persuaded her
to speak with police on March 30. The university contacted the
police for her, Healy said.
   The woman has withdrawn from classes and continues to receive
counseling, he said. The school, with 19,000 students, is run by
the Vincentian Fathers, a Roman Catholic order.
   Healy said the school would continue its investigation as part
of normal disciplinary procedure against the suspended students.
   Reese said the district attorney's investigation also would
continue. ``It doesn't end with these defendants. Others were
involved,'' he said.
   Sodomy is punishable by eight and one-third to 25 years in
prison.
   Mark Alfred, head of the university's largest black students'
group, Haraya, said the issue was suppressed out of concern for the
school's image as well as the victim's wishes. The woman is black
and the accused men are white.
   Alfred was quoted as saying, ``As far as we are concerned, the
school is handling it in an adequate manner.''

   A river of lava flowing from the Kilauea
Volcano destroyed another house today and seemed certain to engulf
the rest of a deserted subdivision.
   Residents, tourists and reporters have gathered in Kalapana, a
beautiful coastal community on the big island of Hawaii, to watch
the town's last days. The 2,000-foot-wide lava flow claimed two
houses Monday, and today's casualty brought the total to 122 since
Kilauea began its current eruption in 1983.
   ``This is a massive glacier of lava, at least a quarter of a
mile wide, at least 10 to 40 feet high behind the front of the
flow,'' said Hawaii County civil defense administrator Harry Kim.
   Only 17 houses remain in the Kalapana Gardens subdivision, and
three were within 50 feet of the lava at dawn today, according to
civil defense spokesman Craig Hindle.
   In addition, several buildings outside the subdivision lie
within the path of the lava flow, including the Kalapana Store and
Drive-In and the Star of the Sea Church.
   Parishioners were making plans to move the church, which sits on
an oceanfront lot in the lava's path. A trucking company is moving
the church for free, and workers removed the church pews, altar and
other items Monday.
   Civil defense officials are worried that if the lava hits the
ocean, it will release toxic sulfuric acid-tainted mist, known as
``laze.''
   No one is still living in Kalapana Gardens. Residents are
allowed in during the day, but are prohibited at night. Most have
their belongings out, but come to say goodbye.

   Rival Christian forces again dueled with
mortars and machine guns in east Beirut today, and police said one
person was killed and six wounded.
   The nation's currency, meanwhile, declined to a 30-month low,
reflecting the war-shattered economy.
   The clashes between troops of Gen. Michel Aoun and fighters of
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia broke out around midnight,
then subsided into intermittent machine gun exchanges by this
morning.
   In the three-month-old fight for control of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave 920 people have died and 2,448 have been wounded,
by police count.
   The conflict, the worst battle between Christians in Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war, has inflicted damage estimated at $1 billion
and blocked plans by the Syrian-backed government of President
Elias Hrawi to unite the divided capital.
   A limited truce was declared Saturday to allow residents of
Kesrouan province north of Beirut to salvage what they could from
their homes. That truce was extended to 6 p.m. today, the Maronite
Catholic Church announced.
   The Central Bank, meanwhile, announced in a currency exchange
list published today that the Lebanese pound cosed Monday at 605 to
the dollar, thge lowest exchange rate since the summer of 1987,
when it hit 735 to the dollar.
   The currency regained some strength in 1988 and continued its
gradual climb in 1989, reaching a rate of 334 to the dollar in
February 1989.
   But when Aoun declared his ``war of liberation'' against the
40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon in March 1989 the currency again
went into decline.
   Before the civil war broke out in April 1975 the Lebanese pound
was one of the Middle East's most stable currencies, at 3.5 to the
dollar.
   Hrawi's government, sworn in on Nov. 24, on April 21 announced a
budget for fiscal 1990 with a record deficit of 64.83 percent.
Government spending was estimated at $1 billion and revenues at
$355 million.
   The government did not say how the deficit would be covered.
   Government authority has disintegrated throughout the war.
Several sectors are controlled by the warring militias, which levy
their own taxes on imports and income and impose fees for municipal
services, electricity and protection.
   Aoun has refused to recognize Hrawi as head of state, preventing
the president's Syrian-backed government from spreading its
authority to the Christian enclave.
   The government has been reluctant to try to control other areas
of Lebanon, dominated by Moslem and leftist militias, without
gaining control of the Christian enclave first.

   John E. List, the Sunday school teacher
who methodically murdered his family 18 years ago, was sentenced
today to five life terms to be served consecutively _ the maximum
penalty.
   List, who did not take the stand during his trial, broke his
silence, but refused to take responsibility for his crimes.
   ``I wish to inform the court I remain truly sorry for the tragic
events of 1971,'' List said in a strong voice, staring straight
ahead.
   ``I feel that because of my mental state at the time, I was
unaccountable for what happened. I ask all affected by this, for
their forgiveness, understanding and prayer.''
   Superior Court Judge William L'E. Wertheimer, however, said that
in the names of the murdered family, he was giving List the
stiffest sentence he could.
   ``John Emil List is without remorse and without honor,''
Wertheimer said. ``After 18 years, five months and 22 days, it is
now time for the voices of Helen, Alma, Patricia, Frederick and
John F. List to rise from the grave.''
   As the judge left the bench, the courtroom, filled with about
125 people, erupted in applause.
   List was convicted April 12 of murdering his wife, Helen, 46;
mother Alma, 84; daughter, Patricia, 16; and sons John, 15, and
Frederick, 13.
   Because of the former accountant's attention to detail in
carrying out the slayings, the bodies remained in their 18-room
Westfield home for almost a full month before they were discovered
_ from Nov. 9, 1971, until Dec. 7.
   In the interim, List left New Jersey, changed his name and began
a new life as Robert P. Clark. He eventually remarried, and worked
as an accountant first in the Denver area and later near Richmond,
Va.
   His second wife, Delores Clark, said she was unaware of his past.
   List was arrested last year after a television show re-enacted
the crime.
   ``I think the case speaks for itself,'' prosecutor Eleanor Clark
said Monday. ``We're asking for the maximum.''
   Witnesses during the trial said List had written notes excusing
his children from school and had the newspaper stopped. He turned
down the thermostat to slow decomposition of the bodies, paid all
his bills, cashed all his checks and left a note for the milkman
telling him he wouldn't be needed for a while.
   Then he shot his family, one by one: his wife over breakfast,
his mother when she asked what the noise was, and then each child
as they returned from school. He left a note for his pastor and
fled.
   His attorney's admitted List killed his family, but said he was
mentally deficient at the time, a product of a strict Lutheran
upbringing with the ``values and ethics of the 19th century.''
   List had written to his pastor that he killed the family out of
fear for their souls and out of economic distress.
   His attorney told jurors that on the day List killed his family,
he ``entered hell with his eyes open.''
   Defense attorney Elijah Miller wanted Wertheimer to allow the
64-year-old List to serve any sentences simultaneously.
   Miller said another option would be for Wertheimer to sentence
List to life imprisonment on just one of the five murder
convictions.
   Under penalties in place when List killed his family in 1971,
the maximum sentence for List is five consecutive life sentences,
which will keep him in jail for the rest of his life.
   If he had been sentenced to five concurrent life terms, however,
he would be eligible for parole in 14 years, 11 months.

   Armed Jewish settlers honored a Supreme Court
deadline today and left the compound they occupied for almost three
weeks in the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's walled Old City.
   A district court judge, meanwhile, sentenced settler leader
Rabbi Moshe Levinger to five months in prison for killing a
Palestinian.
   Levinger shot and killed Kayed Hassan Salah, 42, on Sept. 30,
1988. He was initially charged with manslaughter, which carries a
maximum jail term of 20 years. As part of a plea bargain he
admitted to the lesser charge of causing death by negligence.
   Salah, a shoestore owner, was standing at the entrance to his
shop when he was shot during a stone-throwing incident in the West
Bank town of Hebron.
   At least 29 Palestinians have been slain by settlers since the
start of the uprising nearly 29 months ago, according to Israeli
human rights advocates. Besides Levinger, only one other settler
has been sentenced to jail.
   In the Christian quarter, after heated arguments between
settlers and clergymen, a six-member church delegation was allowed
to inspect the complex to confirm that all the settlers who were
supposed to leave had done so.
   ``They evacuated the settlement, except for 20 people,'' said
Avraham Sochovolsky, an attorney for the Greek Orthodox Church,
which owns the 72-room complex near the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher.
   The 20 Israelis who stayed after the noon deadline were acting
as caretakers for the Panama-based SBC company, which holds the
lease that the church contends is invalid. The Supreme Court ruled
last Thursday that 20 of the 150 settlers could stay pending
settlement of the tenancy dispute.
   The settlement in the four-building St. John's Hospice provoked
outcry from church groups, Washington and other governments when it
was established April 11. It also fueled protest among
Palestinians, both Christian and Moslem.
   The Old City is divided into zealously guarded Christian,
Moslem, Jewish and Armenian quarters, and the slightest changes
have historically resulted in conflict.
   In the past few days, reporters and photographers saw settlers
leave the building in small groups _ apparently to avoid a mass
exit that would look like a retreat.
   Earlier today, the settlers turned back a half-dozen priests who
tried to enter the compound to confirm the evacuation claim, and
also barred reporters.
   Dan Avi-Yitzhak, a lawyer for the 50 families who took over the
building during Easter Week celebrations, said the settlers also
gave a declaration to police that they had left the building.
   Shmuel Eviatar, a settler spokesman, read a statement as bells
from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and other nearby churches
pealed loudly.
   ``No, there is no feeling of failure,'' Eviatar insisted.
   ``Honor for the court and a desire to fulfill not only the
letter but the spirit of the law have led us to maintain only 20
tenants in the building holding the keys.''
   Minutes after the noon deadline expired, a half-dozen bearded
clergymen dressed in black cloaks came to the settlement and
engaged in a 10-minute shouting match with the settlers' spokesman.
   Informed that the settlers had left, they pointed to a woman who
could be seen through a window inside the building. Settlers said
she was a cook.
   On Friday, Christian clergy closed holy sites throughout the
Holy Land to protest the settlement.
   There have also been protests from the United States, Greece and
Arab countries over the move into the Old City, which was captured
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed by Israel.
   The settlers had sublet the property from an Armenian Christian.
They argued Jews should be allowed to live anywhere, especially in
the capital of the Jewish state.
   The move into the Christian quarter was seen as part of a
broader campaign by right-wingers to push new settlement activity
in the Israeli-occupied lands, taking advantage of a political
vacuum.
   On March 15 the Labor Party left the government led by Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir in a dispute over U.S. peace proposals.
Shamir now leads the caretaker government and is trying to form a
Cabinet.
   The U.S. government has criticized settlements as an obstacle to
peace.

   A former Playboy model, accused of evading
taxes on money she received for having sex with an elderly
millionaire, was a ``kept'' woman, a former accountant who prepared
her tax returns said today.
   Prosecutors say Lynnette Harris, 35, and her twin sister
accepted more than $1 million in cash and goods from businessman
David Kritzik of suburban Shorewood. He died last year at age 89.
   Her sister, Leigh Ann Conley of Milwaukee, is charged with four
counts of failing to file federal income tax returns in the same
alleged scheme. She is scheduled to stand trial in June.
   The government alleged the money was paid in exchange for sex.
Dennis Coffey, Ms. Harris' attorney, said Kritzik gave the money as
gifts.
   Former accountant William G. Domer, who now operates a wholesale
bakery, said he met Ms. Harris in February 1985 when she consulted
with him about her taxes, showing him four 1983 checks from Kritzik
totaling $100,000 and 1984 checks totaling $25,000 to $30,000.
   The 1983 checks were not reported to the Internal Revenue
Service as income, Domer said.
   ``I had assumed and I had a conversation with Mr. Kritzik that
led me to feel those amounts were a gift,'' he said.
   Domer said Ms. Harris told him the money was for a facial
reconstruction she underwent in California.
   The 1984 checks were listed on Ms. Harris's tax return as
``other income,'' Domer said. He said he had no reason to think the
checks in 1984 were gifts.
   When asked what he thought of Ms. Harris' relationship with
Kritzik, Domer said, ``The word `kept' pops into my mind.''
   Before Ms. Harris' jury was selected Monday, U.S. District Judge
Thomas Curran rejected an Internal Revenue Service affidavit in
which Kritzik characterized her as a prostitute was inadmissable.
   Loss of the affidavit as evidence may make the government's case
more difficult to prove, because it is believed to be the only
statement from Kritzik implicating the twins in the sex-for-money
arrangement.
   Ms. Harris, a former actress and model, faces two counts of tax
evasion and two counts of failure to file income tax returns. The
charges carry a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison and $625,000
in fines.
   In opening statements, U.S. Attorney Mel Johnson said government
documents and witnesses would show that ``the payments were
taxable, she knew it and willfully evaded it.''
   Coffey told the jury the evidence would prove that many of the
government's witnesses ``are serving their own interests by
testifying.''
   The identical blonde twins, who appeared nude together in two
movies and in a 1981 edition of Playboy, allegedly spent alternate
nights with Kritzik for more than five years until June 1987.
   IRS agent James Ansier, who interviewed Kritzik in December 1987
at his Palm Springs, Calif., home, testified Monday that Kritzik
told him the checks he wrote to Ms. Harris were payments for
services.
   ``He said it was not a gift,'' Ansier said. ``He was clear and
convincing in everything he said.''
   In throwing out the affidavit, Curran said he believed an
unexpected visit by an IRS agent ``strikes fear in the heart of any
reasonable person.''
   Curran said it was safe to assume Kritzik thought the IRS was
investigating his own financial affairs and had ``sufficient
motivation,'' to ``claim these payments were for services
rendered.''
   ``The court is of the position that Mr. Kritzik found himself
between the proverbial rock and a hard place,'' the judge said.
   Curran also said he suspected Kritzik answered the questions
without ``realizing he might place Ms. Harris in a difficult
position.''

<HEAD>Cheney Extends Freeze on Military Contracts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has extended
a three-month freeze on new military building contracts by 45 days
and suggested cutting nearly $750 million in other defense
construction, sources said today.
   The moratorium, which took effect Jan. 24, expired Monday. But
in a memorandum to Pentagon officials, Cheney said the freeze
should continue until June 15.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the memo in advance of a
briefing Cheney scheduled to discuss the moratorium extension.
   In he memo, Cheney directs Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald J.
Atwood to prepare a list of proposed military construction projects
that merit cancellation and submit that list to him by June 1.
   Cheney attached his own candidates for such a list, suggesting
$322 million in overseas construction projects and $427 million in
domestic projects that might well be cut.
   In preparing a recission list, Cheney said Pentagon officials
should consider ``base closures and realignments, changes in the
force structure and disposition of the armed forces, including
fiscal constraints on resources for national defense, and any other
matters that affect the Department's need for military
construction.''
   The moratorium, part of a series of belt-tightening moves,
includes contracts for architectural and engineering design
services. The only exceptions to the freeze are those permitted by
Atwood ``to meet urgent requirements,'' according to the memo.
   The Pentagon's 1990 fiscal military construction budget as
approved by Congress was about $8.5 billion. The budget made cuts
in foreign bases, but added money for domestic installations.
   Cheney's recission list recommends cutting all Navy homeport
projects in the Gulf of Mexico, a suggestion that drew immediate
criticism from Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   ``I urge you to reverse those decisions,'' said Bentsen, D-Texas.

   The Bush administration will consider
returning Iraq to its list of countries that sponsor international
terrorism, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told Congress
today.
   Baker said Iraq's efforts to develop a nuclear program was
``particularly disturbing.'' Iraq was removed from the list in 1984.
   ``I think we have to take a look at this issue, and we will be
taking a look at this issue,'' Baker told a Senate appropriations
subcommittee a day after the State Department's annual report to
Congress on terrorism.
   That report cited six nations for sponsoring international
terrorism, including Syria and Iran, which won praise from
President Bush on Monday for their help in the release of American
hostage Frank H. Reed in Lebanon.
   Countries on the list are denied advanced American technology
and U.S. support for various international bank loans. In addition
to Syria and Iran, the list includes Libya, Cuba, North Korea and
South Yeman.
   Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., told Baker that whatever the
administration's decision, he would promote legislation in Congress
to put Iraq on the terrorism list.
   Baker said the administration was considering several sanctions
against the Iraqi government, including a denial of credits for
agricultural purchases. But he cautioned, ``We ought to be at least
conscious if we take that action, our allies will be very quick to
pick up our market there,'' he said.
   The State Department terrorism report credited Syria and Libya
with showing some improvement. And it said Iran had a slight
decline _ from 32 incidents of supporting terrorism in 1988 to 28
last year.
   The report, released Monday, recorded a sharp drop worldwide as
well as among American victims. Sixteen U.S. citizens were killed
and 19 wounded, compared with 192 killed and 40 wounded in 1988;
the bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
accounted for most of the 1988 deaths.
   Overall, the number of terrorist incidents fell off nearly 38
percent _ from 856 in 1988 to 528 last year.
   Syria and Iran remain on the State Department's list of
supporters of terrorism, though Syria's willingness to help
liberate Western hostages and a pledge by President Hafez Assad to
punish perpetrators were noted.
   On the other hand, Syria continued to provide support and safe
haven for a wide variety of groups engaged in terrorism, the report
said. Among them is the militant Hezbollah group, with which
holders of the six remaining American hostages in Lebanon are
considered linked.
   Iran, meanwhile, was accused in the report of continuing to use
terrorism after the death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in
June in pursuit of its foreign policy goals.
   Examples cited by the report included a call for the death of
Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' and increased
attacks against interests of Saudi Arabia, including explosion of
two bombs during the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani, sometimes credited with taking a
moderate stance, was criticized for exhorting Palestinians to kill
Americans and other Westerners in order to avenge Palestinians
killed during the rebellion against Israel on the West Bank and in
Gaza.
   Rafsanjani also publicly encouraged the hijacking of airplanes
and the blowing up of factories, the report said.
   Libya, while listed as a sponsor of terrorism, was credited in
the report with continuing to show public signs of moderation.
There were no incidents throughout the year directly attributable
to the North African country led by Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the
report said.
   With the level of terrorism in sharp decline worldwide, the only
spectacular operation was the bombing of a French airliner over
Niger last September, causing 171 deaths.
   Also, the Afghan government curtailed its terrorist campaign in
neighboring Pakistan and operations by groups associated with the
Palestine Liberation Organization sharply declined after Chairman
Yasser Arafat publicly renounced terrorism in December 1988, the
report said.
   A change in accounting by the State Department's
Counter-Terrorism Office also contributed to the dropoff. For the
first time, violence by Palestinians against Palestinians on the
West Bank and in Gaza is not considered an act of international
terrorism.
   The reason, the report said in a footnote, is that the attacks
are a form of ``intra-ethnic violence,'' meaning within the same
group. This helped bring the overall total down.
   The 528 incidents of terrorism recorded by the State Department
resulted in 390 victims killed and 397 wounded. Fourteen terrorists
were killed and 23 wounded.
   In 1988, by contrast, 638 victims were killed and 1,125 were
wounded.
   Most of the attacks occurred in the Middle East, followed by
Latin America and Western Europe.

   Television viewers continue to show how much
they love Lucy.
   The 39-year-old pilot for what became CBS' classic ``I Love
Lucy'' series got higher ratings than the combined ratings of two
new shows opposing it, prelminary audience estimates showed today.
   Hosted by Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz,
the one-hour CBS special, ``I Love Lucy: The Very First Show,''
averaged a 21.7 rating and a 37 percent share of the audience in 24
cities Monday night.
   That easily outpaced the 9.6 rating and 16 percent audience
share of NBC's ``Shannon's Deal'' and the 6.3 rating and 11 percent
audience share of ABC's ``Capital News'' in the same time period.
   The Ball show got its largest audiences in Cincinnati and
Minneapolis, where it attracted 46 percent and 45 percent of the
audience in its time period, respectively.
   Monday's CBS special was the premiere of the 34-minute ``I Love
Lucy'' pilot, made on kinescope on March 10, 1951, when Ball, who
died last year, was five months pregnant with her daughter.
   The pilot, produced by Ball and her husband with $5,000 of their
own money, never was broadcast until Monday. CBS preferred a
different opening episode when the series began.
   CBS televised ``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1961.

   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara went
today to Capitol Hill, where a bill containing $420 million for his
country inched its way through a tangle of unrelated amendments in
the Senate.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hoped
to complete the supplemental money bill today and send it to a
conference with the House to work out differences between competing
versions.
   Endara, who met with President Bush on Monday, conferred with
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and members of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee. He planned later meetings with Mitchell
and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   At the same time, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
chastised Congress for delaying the aid package. ``I really worry
that we have succumbed to the temptation to play politics with the
future of freedom and democracy in Central America,'' he told a
Senate Appropriations subcommittee.
   Prospects for the bill brightened late Monday when the Senate
accepted by voice vote two provisions that had been road blocks,
dealing with abortions and the death penalty in the District of
Columbia.
   Senators agreed to allow use of D.C. funds to pay for abortions
for poor women, and permit the death penalty for drug-related
murders in the district, with the understanding that final wording
would be worked out in negotiations with the House.
   They also agreed to limit additional amendments to a list
including Lithuania, Cuba, and aid to South American countries
trying to halt drug production.
   But if the abortion payment provision remains in the bill, Bush
has vowed to veto it, which would lead to further delay.
   ``I've asked and asked again that our aid package to the newly
liberated people of Panama be passed and passed swiftly. And still
it waits, and with it the future of the fledgling democracy,'' Bush
said, Endara at his side, after the two leaders met for 2{ hours on
Monday.
   Endara was installed as president last Dec. 20 after U.S.
invasion forces toppled the government of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega. Bush is seeking a quick infusion of U.S. aid to help
restart the country's economy, stalled by U.S. economic sanctions
and damage from the invasion.
   The aid measure also includes $300 million that Bush requested
for the new democratic government of Nicaragua, along with hundreds
of millions in spending added by Congress for domestic programs
ranging from food stamps to veterans' benefits and pet local
projects.
   During Endara's White House visit, Bush announced plans to
nominate the first Panamanian to manage the Panama Canal: Gilberto
Guardia Fabrega, 60, president of a Panama City architectural and
engineering company. The 1978 Panama Canal treaties call for a
Panamanian to be put n charge ths year, subject to Senate
confirmation.
   The U.S.-built canal is to be turned over to Panama in the year
2000.

<TEXT>
   A former Argentine general accused of
ordering mass murders has been ordered to pay damages totaling $89
million in three lawsuits, but it's possible none of the money will
ever be collected.
   Lawyers for plaintiffs who blame Carlos Suarez Mason for
atrocities in Argentine military prisons believe he possesses
hidden wealth, but they have been unable to find it.
   In a ruling made public Monday, U.S. District Judge Lowell
Jensen ordered Suarez Mason, who was extradited to his homeland, to
pay $8 million to two former Argentines whose relatives were
tortured and killed in the 1970s.
   The plaintiffs, now residents of Alexandria, Va., sought a total
of $40 million in damages.
   Two earlier damage awards included $21 million to a lawyer who
was tortured repeatedly during four years' imprisonment and $60
million to the relatives of three men who were killed.
   Suarez Mason commanded the First Army Corps in Buenos Aires
under the military government from 1976 to 1979.
   He was arrested in a San Francisco suburb in January 1987 and
extradited to Argentina in May 1988 to face 39 murder charges, all
involving the killing of prisoners by soldiers under his command.
He remains jailed in Buenos Aires, awaiting trial.
   As Suarez Mason awaited extradition, several former Argentines
living in the United States sued him for damages. Those complaints
were filed under laws allowing suits for international human rights
violations committed by a foreigner who has come under the
jurisdiction of a U.S. court.
   Suarez Mason did not file answers to the suits and was held in
default.
   Jensen said one of the plaintiffs in his ruling, Debora
Benchoam, was held without charges from July 1977 to November 1981.
He said she was tortured and sexually abused several times and
robbed of her jewelry by forces under Suarez Mason's control.
   She also was forced to watch as the soldiers twice shot her
brother Reuben, who was later beaten and murdered, according to the
judge.
   Jensen awarded her $3 million for pain and suffering and $3
million in punitive damages.
   The second plaintiff, Alfredo Forti, and his mother and four
brothers were abducted by Suarez Mason's soldiers, held for a week
without charges and robbed of most of their belongings, Jensen
said. He said Forti was separated from his mother, who was never
seen or heard from again.
   In an earlier ruling in the case, Jensen ruled that causing the
``disappearance'' of Forti's mother was a violation of
international law subject to a damage suit in this country. Forti's
lawyer said it was the first such ruling by a U.S. court.
   Jensen awarded Forti $1 million for emotional distress and $1
million in punitive damages.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney extended the
Pentagon's freeze on military construction projects today and
ordered that 207 projects _ including four controversial Navy ports
in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and New York _ be reviewed for
possible cancellation.
   Cheney's action will cause consternation on Capitol Hill, which
has been locked with Cheney in a tense debate over slashing the
defense budget and some lawmaker's attempts to protect local jobs.
   Cheney, in a statement issued at the Pentagon, said the order
affects ``more than $7 billion in new construction contracts'' in
the United States, Western Europe and the Pacific.
   The 207 construction projects to be reviewed are valued at $1.2
billion and include four of the sites identified by the Navy as
strategic home ports in Ingleside, Texas; Mobile, Ala.; Pascagoula,
Miss.; and Staten Island, N.Y., the statement said.
   The secretary said he was forced to continue the freeze _
instituted in January _ through June 15th because of possible
budget cutbacks ordered by Capitol Hill and the sweeping changes in
international events.
   ``In light of the enormous uncertainty over the level of funding
that Congress will approve for future defense budgets, including
the budget for fiscal 1991, I have no choice but to extend the
construction freeze,'' Cheney said.
   Citing changes in the world situation and increasing budget
limitations, Cheney said, ``Signifcant opportunities exist to
reduce the cost and size of the future infrastructure for the
Department of Defense.
   ``Some of these actions may not be popular with members of
Congress who want to cut the defense budget even as they plead to
save the projects in their own states and districts,'' he said.
``But when tight budgets force dedicated soldiers to turn in their
uniforms and leave the service, I cannot put construction projects
ahead of people.''
   The House was scheduled to vote today on a House Budget
Committee proposal that would significantly reduce defense spending
from President Bush's proposed $303.3 billion for fiscal 1991.
   The secretary's order directs that no new construction contracts
be awarded for projects financed under the military construction
budget approved by Congress.
   The 207 construction projects will be ``candidates for
rescission,'' which means Cheney may recommend that Congress revoke
the funding approve for earlier projects.
   The statement said Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood will
review the Department's construction plans for possible
cancellation and submit a proposed list of rescissions to Cheney by
June 1.
   The statement said that besides the four ports, the review will
also include the items:
   _$110 million for the large rocket test facility at Arnold, Tenn.
   _$60 millin in improvements at Fort Hood and Red River Army
Depot in Texas.
   _$37 millino for the consolidated maintenance facility at
Tooele, Utah.

   The first woman to go to sea on a Royal Navy ship
says the enlisted men often call her ``sir'' by mistake.
   ``I get called sir probably half the time because the majority
of the ratings (sailors) forget I'm female,'' Second Officer Chella
Franklin said Tuesday.
   ``I'm there wearing trousers and a tie and doing a job and they
don't really think about it.''
   The 26-year-old officer should be called ``ma'am,'' but she
says: ``I'm happy they accept me that easily.''
   Ms. Franklin is assigned to the Royal Navy's newest ship, HMS
Norfolk, where she is responsible for managing the people who
maintain the frigate's sophisticated weapons equipment.
   A member of the Women's Royal Naval Reserve (Wrens), Ms.
Franklin was with the ship when it was being built and officially
joined her company in February when it was announced Wrens would be
allowed to go to sea.
   As an officer she has her own cabin and shares one of the two

   Police uncovered a cache of weapons and

reported Tuesday.
   Officers found machine guns, anti-tank mines, mortar, rocket
launchers, mostly of Soviet and Eastern European origin, and 19
AK-47 automatic assault rifles. The items were stashed in an old
mine shaft at the farm about 12 miles north of Harare, The Herald

   Police arrested the farm's owner, David Wheeler, according to
The Herald, which is published by the state-owned Mass Media Trust.
He was released on a $40,000 bond and was allowed to return to his
$1.8 million property.
   There was no indication whether the arms were hidden during or
after the seven-year guerrilla war that led to Zimbabwe's
independence in 1980. Guerrillas had been equipped with Soviet and
Chinese weapons in the independence war.

   The government will restart the first of three
tritium production reactors at its South Carolina atomic weapons
plant in December and resume producing plutonium triggers by next
July at a Colorado plant, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said
today.
   Watkins told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that four
plants, including three reactors at its Savannah River complex in
South Carolina, will resume producing nuclear weapons components by
the end of 1991.
   The three reactors have been shut down since mid-1988 over
environmental and safety-related concerns. U.S. nuclear weapons
production has ground to a halt in the past several months because
of that and suspension of operations at the Rocky Flats plant in
Colorado last November over similar concerns, .
   Watkins said the K reactor at Savannah River is tentatively
scheduled to reopen with low-power testing on Dec. 10, followed by
full-power production in late December or early January.
   The P reactor at Savannah River is to be restarted next March,
with production of weapons components scheduled to resume in April,
he said.
   The L reactor at Savannah River will be restarted in September
1991, Watkins said.
   In addition, he said two facilities at the Rocky Flats plant for
producing the plutonium triggers in atomic warheads will resume
operations in June and July.
   ``At this time, there does not seem to be any alternative for
the nation other than keeping Rocky Flats on line to deal with
warhead management,'' Watkings told the strategic forces and
nuclear deterrence subcommittee.
   Environmental and antinuclear groups and organizations of local
residents living near the plants asked Watkins at a meeting Monday
to request a moratorium on weapons production.
   But members of the Senate panel said the country cannot afford
to go without weapons production indefinitely.
   ``I wish I could say we don't need any production of weapons
material,'' said subcommittee Chairman J. James Exon, D-Neb. ``That
is not the case. The Soviet Union is going to be relying on its
nucelar deterrent as a strategy than ever before.''
   Watkins repeated his Monday assertion to the coalition of
environmental and antinuclear groups that the president, Congress
and the secretary of defense determine the need for weapons
production.
   ``It's my job to deliver the goods,'' he told the coalition,
called the Military Production Network.
   Lisa Crawford of the Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety
and Health, which recently won a $78 million court settlement
against the Energy Department's former contractor at the Fernald
uranium processing plant in Ohio, said the government must be more
open about operations at nuclear weapons factories.
   ``The folks who live around these ... facilities are really
disillusioned,'' she told Watkins. She said she and others who
lived near the Fernald plant learned in 1985 they had been drinking
from a uranium-contaminated well since 1981, and that the
government had known but did not tell them.
   The department has agreed to a wide study of the environmental
impact of weapons plant modernization, but has not said this would
affect its schedule for getting the main production plants back on
line after lengthy shutdowns.
   At a news conference before meeting Watkins, coalition leaders
criticized him for failing to change the department's acknowledged
record of improving weapons production at the expense of
environmental protection and public health.
   On Watkins' list of priorities, like those of his predecessors,
``production of new nuclear weapons comes first, comes second and
comes third; environmental protection comes after that,'' said
Elizabeth Paul, director of the Snake River Alliance, an
Idaho-based citizens group that opposes further arms production.
   Watkins has repeatedly declared his intention to put
environmental protection on a par with weapons production.
   The group also presented what it called a report card on
Watkins' performance since he took the helm of the Energy
Department 14 months ago. They gave him an ``A'' for public
relations, a ``D-plus'' for compliance with environmental laws, a
``C-minus'' for protecting worker and community health and a ``D''
for openness and accountability.

were not arrested, nor detained in a commissariat or police post.''
   The two doctors belong to the Paris-based Association for the

   The London-based human rights group Amnesty International has
accused King Hassan II's police of torturing and mistreating
suspects held in custody pending the filing of criminal charges.
The government denies the charges.

<HEAD>Government, ANC Play Down Upcoming Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress and
the white minority government on Tuesday cautioned against high
expectations for their historic talks this week on removing
obstacles to constitutional negotiations.
   ``The public should not be misled,'' the ANC's press liaison
officer, Patrick Lekota, said at a news briefing on the eve of the
scheduled three-day discussions. ``What is taking place tomorrow is
talks about talks.''
   Gerrit Viljoen, minister of constitutional development, said the
government realized the urgency of the talks because of widespread
violence in South Africa.
   ``But we also believe it will take time to build trust and
understanding as a foundation for finding mutually satisfactory
solutions and for them to have a good chance of working,'' he said.
   Both sides have predicted negotiations will be long and tedious
with many major fundamental differences to be resolved.
   The ANC is demanding the government end a state of emergency and
release all political prisoners as preconditions for full talks.
The government is demanding the ANC renounce its ``armed struggle''
and help end political violence that has claimed hundreds of lives
in recent weeks.
   The talks, scheduled to begin Wednesday at the government's
luxurious Groote Schuur estate, will involve a Cabinet team led by
President F.W. de Klerk and a delegation of exiled and internal ANC
leaders headed by Deputy ANC President Nelson Mandela.
   The ANC has been seeking talks with the government since it was
formed in 1918. De Klerk legalized the ANC, Communist Party and
other opposition groups in February, when he also freed Mandela.
   At the time, he urged black leaders to negotiate the end of
apartheid and help develop a new constitution that would give an
equal voice in government to the voteless black majority while
preserving the political, economic and cultural rights of whites
and other minority groups.
   Both sides have taken pains to emphasize that this week's
meetings are not negotiations, but only talks aimed at removing
obstacles and creating a proper climate for eventual discussions on
a new constitution.
   The government has promised its white constituency that it will
negotiate only with groups that renounce violence. De Klerk has
said the ANC leaders' continued calls for armed struggle hinder the
chances for negotiations.
   The government and the ANC may not resolve all of their
differences this week and further exploratory talks may be
necessary, according to government officials. No date has been set
for full-scale negotiations.
   Lekota said members of the ANC delegation _ protected at an
exclusive hotel by security police and ANC marshals _ were busy
Tuesday refining their approach to the talks.
   He read a statement in which the ANC delegation said its morale
was high.
   ``The delegation is very enthusiastic and it is confident that
it will match the government's side,'' Lekota said.
   About 2,000 people marched in mixed-race townships outside Cape
Town Tuesday in the first legal May Day march at which the
Communist Party flag was carried.
   Late last year the government declared May Day a workers'
holiday in response to years of protests and illegal strikes by
black trade unions.
   Police reported Tuesday that six people had died, seven were
wounded and many houses and vehicles were damaged in unrest on
Sunday and Monday.
   Police said four women, including an 80-year-old, were burned to
death near Port Shepstone on the southern Natal coast, where black
factions have been engaged in a power struggle for the past two
weeks.
   Six people were injured when police fired at violent groups or
defended themselves against mob attacks, police said.

   Jose ``Tony'' Deleu, a butler who claimed he was
fired by a Manhattan socialite because he had AIDS, has died. He
was 47.
   Deleu died Friday at New York Hospital and a funeral was held
Monday.
   Hours before his death, Deleu said he forgave his employer,
saying: ``I don't have any hard feelings. I feel very bad about all
this,'' according to Deleu's brother, Carlos.
   Deleu had filed a $1.5 million discrimination lawsuit against
France Scaife, wife of an heir to the Mellon family fortune and a
committeewoman on the Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force.
   Deleu's attorney, David Spears, said the discrimination claim
was recently dropped because of a loophole in the state
anti-discrimination law that exempts domestics.
   Spears said he planned to continue fighting Deleu's lawsuit on
charges that Mrs. Scaife owed him overtime pay and Social Security
and health insurance benefits.
   Deleu worked as Mrs. Scaife's butler at her Upper East Side
apartment for seven years.
   Mrs. Scaife's lawyer, Bruce Kaplan, said his client, ``grieves
for him and his loved ones.''

   Gov. Mike Sullivan, who came into office
four years ago on a campaign to spur Wyoming's economy, reiterated
that pledge today in announcing his bid for a second term.
   Sullivan, 50, a Democrat who left his Casper law practice in
1986 to make his first bid for public office, said he had succeeded
if for no other reason than that the economy hasn't been the
``economic wasteland'' some predicted.
   ``There is no question that we've made sacrifices, that it's
been a lot of hard work, and it's been difficult times in
Wyoming,'' Sullivan told a crowd of supporters who gathered at his
office to hear his announcement.
   ``But some of the dire predictions, the doom and gloom that was
predicted four years ago, has been averted.''
   The governor said he expects his likely opponent, Republican
Mary Mead, to challenge his claim that the economy has improved.
She is a Jackson rancher, the daughter of former Gov. Cliff Hansen.
   Sullivan is expected to face only token opposition in the Aug.
21 Democratic primary.
   When Sullivan ran for his first term, Wyoming was in the depths
of a recession induced by the slump in its oil industry.
   Oil prices are a bit more stable now, but remain low enough to
discourage major exploration and production in Wyoming's oil fields.
   Without that production, the Sullivan administration has worked
on increasing international trade and tourism.
   Among other things, the governor has thrown his support behind a
$250 million low-interest loan for use in enticing companies to
build a natural gas pipeline from Wyoming to California that will
carry Wyoming gas.

   A second high school student fatally shot
himself only hours after a fellow student professed his love for a
girl and shot himself to death in front of her and classmates,
officials say.
   Thomas M. Chidester, a 19-year-old senior who died Monday
evening of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, wasn't in
the American history class where junior Thomas Smith, 17, killed
himself.
   Chidester attended ``a class or two'' with Smith, said Steve
Brown, assistant superintendent of the Sheridan School District. He
referred questions about the second death to the Grant County
sheriff's office. Police and sheriff's officials declined to
comment immediately.
   The deaths were the second and third suicides by Sheridan High
School students in the last month, and fourth suicide in five weeks
in the community of 3,000 about 25 miles south of Little Rock,
police said.
   Smith was pronounced dead about four hours after asking his
teacher for permission to speak to his fifth-period class, Police
Chief David Hooks said.
   ``I think he said he loved a girl, pulled the gun out and waved
it around, put it to his forehead and pulled the trigger,'' Hooks
said.
   Rhonda Damron, 17, of Sheridan said Smith was talking about her.
   ``He said he wanted to say two things about his weekend: One, he
was in love with me, and ... then he pulled the gun from the front
of his pants and shot himself,'' she said.
   Ms. Damron said she and Smith had been classmates since sixth
grade and became ``very, very close friends'' last year. ``We would
tell each other everything. That was all it was,'' she said.
   She said history teacher Rick Ward gave Smith permission to
speak to the class for five minutes ``if he didn't say anything not
proper for school.'' Ms. Damron said Smith ``was always
interrupting the class.''
   She said Smith took Ward's place behind the podium in the class.
``I put my head on my desk and when I looked up he had the gun
out,'' she said. ``Everyone started screaming, `No. No.'''
   She said Ward moved toward the teen-ager and told Smith not to
use the gun. ``He slowed down then because it seemed like the
faster he went, the faster Thomas went,'' Ms. Damron said. ``Then
he shot himself.''
   Brown said mental health counselors were at the school this
morning to help students cope. He said teachers were told before
school began how to deal with the students, and classes began as
normal at 8:10 a.m.
   Smith shot himself once in the head with a small-caliber
handgun, police said. Authorities don't know where the student
obtained the gun, which was recovered.
   An autopsy will be performed by the state medical examiner, Hook
said.
   Smith, who teachers said was not a discipline problem, was the
son of a Grant County auxiliary sheriff's deputy, Stanley Smith.

   Congressional leaders today gave President
Bush strong support for his refusal to bargain for the release of
American hostages in Lebanon and expressed hope ``we're seeing the
beginning of the end'' of their captivity.
   Bush met at the White House with Democratic and Republican
leaders one day after educator Frank Reed was released following 43
months in captivity. He was the second American freed in eight
days, following the April 22 release of Robert Polhill, who was
held for 39 months.
   ``I think the president has strong support in his view that we
can't bargain hostage-by-hostage,'' House Speaker Tom Foley,
D-Wash., said afterward.
   ``The basic position that we don't bargain for the release of
hostages is one widely shared by the Congress as well as the
executive branch,'' he said.
   Expressing hopes for freedom of the six Americans still in
captivity, Foley said, ``We're seeing the beginning of the end of
the hostage-taking and the hostage-holding.''
   The speaker steered clear of discussing Congress' attitude
toward the 400 Shiite prisoners held by Israel. Saying these are
delicate matters, Foley said, ``I think we want to do whatever is
useful in encouraging the release of people who have been held
without cause or without reason.''
   On Monday, Bush gently nudged Israel to release a Shiite cleric,
Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, and others as demanded by a Tehran
newspaper as a next step in the process.
   Bush said he had ``certainly no objection'' to such an action,
adding, ``And that is a matter for others to determine.'' In the
past, Israel has freed hundreds of Arab prisoners to attain the
release of a handful of Israeli captives.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, pressed to
elaborate on Bush's comment, said Israel is a sovereign nation and
the United States will not tell it what to do. However, he said,
``Our policy is that all hostages should be released.''
   He refused to say whether the United States considers the
Shiites as hostages or prisoners of war.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said State Department legal adviser Abraham
Sofaer was in the Netherlands at the Hague for a regularly
scheduled meeting of the Iran-U.S. claims tribunal, which is
arbitrating legal and financial disputes between the two countries.
   Fitzwater said the meeting was not connected with the hostages'
release.
   As he met with congressional leaders today, Bush said ``it is
joyous news'' that Reed was released. He also noted that Polhill
had given him a secret message Monday from his captors but refused
to comment further on the hostages.
   Bush publicly praised Syria and Iran for exerting pressure on
the kidnappers.
   Yet, Bush also prodded Syria and Iran to work for the release of
more hostages, emphasizing they should not expect normal relations
or ``vast improvement until all Americans are freed.''
   ``When a step is taken that goes toward that day when all
hostages are released, I should say thank you,'' Bush said. ``But
beyond that, I can't say that I can be happy.
   ``I've tried to put myself in the place of the other families
and say, `Hey, what about my loved one?' So this is a tough
business,'' the president said.
   Appearing before a Senate appropriations subcommittee, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III was asked what the United States might
be asked to due in return for assistance by Iran and Syria in
gaining release of Polhill and Reed.
   ``I will not comment on what we are being asked to do, directly
or indirectly,'' replied Baker.
   He went on to say that ``our policy is that we should not engage
in deal-making'' over hostages.
   Ignoring the advice of some advisers, Bush took no steps to
postpone the release of a State Department report on terrorism that
criticized both Syria and Iran.
   The report, marring the two nations' efforts to improve their
reputations, said Iran still uses terrorism in pursuit of foreign
policy goals, and Syria continues to support a variety of terrorist
groups.
   As Reed was relishing his first hours of freedom in Damascus,
Syria, Bush met at the White House with Polhill, who has been
undergoing treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center here.
   Polhill, suffering from a growth on his vocal cords, spoke in a
raspy whisper. He said he could not offer much information about
the other hostages.
   During an hour-long meeting with Bush, Polhill delivered a
message from his kidnappers. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the contents would not be revealed publicly because Polhill
had guaranteed his captors that it would be ``private and personal
to President Bush only.''
   The president's words of praise for Iran in Reed's release were
in sharp contrast to his reluctance to give Tehran much credit when
Polhill was freed.
   Iranian officials were said to have been furious over what was
perceived as a slight. In the latest instance, Bush singled out
Iran for ``using its influence to help bring about this
humanitarian step.''
   U.S. officials said privately the words were intended as a
reward for Iran, which after years of isolation from the West, was
seeking recognition for positive deeds.
   Iran, meanwhile, said no more Americans would be released unless
the United States reciprocated with a gesture of Bush's oft-stated
promise that ``goodwill begets goodwill.''
   ``Now the ball is in the court of the U.S. and the Western
countries,'' said the English-language Tehran Times, considered
close to President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Asked if he was ready to make a goodwill gesture in return for
the hostages' release, Bush said all must be freed.
   ``We're not in a piecemeal basis, bidding for one human life,
holding out hopes, only to have them dashed for one American family
or another,'' he said.

<HEAD>Man Who Dangled From Bridge Sentenced to 100 Hours Community

<TEXT>
   ``Mega Man,'' a disabled man who was arrested
for dangling by ropes from the George Washington Bridge, has been
ordered to perform 100 hours of community service in a hospital.
   ``Once I do my 100 hours, I'll do 100 more just for myself,''
Mega Man, whose real name is Raymond Muhammed, said at his
sentencing Monday.
   To encourage other disabled people to reach their potential,
Muhammed has pulled other stunts in and over the water, with and
without his wheelchair.
   The 42-year-old Bronx resident, who was left disabled after
being caught in a street shooting 13 years ago, was arrested at the
bridge June 5 and charged with reckless endangerment, a felony. He
pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of trespassing.
   Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Barbara Newman sentenced him to
work with the physically disabled at St. Claire's Hospital.
   At the Brooklyn Bridge in August 1988, Mega Man suspended
himself and his wheelchair from a rope over the East River.
   Soon after, he rolled himself off the Staten Island ferry into
the water near the Statue of Liberty.
   ``People look at you in a wheelchair like you got to be
homebound or on welfare,'' Muhammad complained. ``You are
handicapped only in your mind.''
   Muhammad, who now works as an actor and has appeared in the soap
opera ``As the World Turns,'' told the judge his plans include
water skiing in a chair around the southern end of Manhattan.

   A state district judge today gave state lawmakers
an additional month to reform school finance, but said he also was
appointing a special master to draw up an alternate plan in case
legislators again fail.
   Earlier today, Judge Scott McCown ruled that nearly $500 million
in state education aid can't be paid to local school districts as
scheduled on May 25.
   In a second hearing, McCown gave the state an extension until
June 1 to develop a new school finance plan.
   But, McCown said the court will work concurrently with the
executive and legislative branches by appointing a special master
to draw an equitable school finance plan.
   The court's plan will go into effect on Sept. 1 if the
Legislature doesn't have its own finance plan ready by then, McCown
said.
   ``The present scheme of public school finance is a great
wrong,'' he said. ``The poor have waited for too long.''
   State officials had asked for a 50-day delay to give lawmakers
and Gov. Bill Clements more time to work out a school finance
reform plan.
   With the state Legislature's 30-day session at an end, House
Speaker Gib Lewis said Clements would call lawmakers into another
special session _ the third on education _ at 2 p.m. Wednesday.
   The state's highest court last year called the $13.5 billion
school system unfair to property-poor school districts and ordered
a reform plan by today, but lawmakers and the governor are locked
in a battle over increasing taxes to pay for reform.
   McCown's ruling doesn't apply to non-state sources of school
funds, including local and federal aid. State officials have said
they believe schools can remain open at least until May 25, when
the $500 million monthly aid payment was due to go out.
   The judge also said the state can pay the $2.7 million payroll
for Texas Education Agency employees that had been held up pending
his ruling. State Comptroller Bob Bullock had said earlier that he
intended to freeze education payments, including payroll checks.
   The Legislature proposed a $555 million reform plan and a
half-cent sales tax increase to fund it and pump more money to
poorer school districts. The proposal would boost the sales tax
from 6 cents to 6{ cents on the dollar, but Clements said he would
veto the bill, saying money is available elsewhere for a less
expensive reform plan.
   Clements' veto vow prompted about 300 teachers to picket the
governor's mansion Monday. He was out of town.
   ``We want to send a message to the people of the state of Texas,
as well as the governor, that this is a serious issue that has
reached a critical stage,'' said Shelley Potter, president of the
San Antonio Federation of Teachers.
   Texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned
school finance systems deemed unfair to poor districts. The others
are Kentucky, New Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin, California,
Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and
Montana.
   Texas has 1,100 school districts. More than $400 million in
April state aid payments went to schools last Wednesday. Bullock
said the money he would withhold unless the judge intercedes
included nearly $2.7 million in payroll checks due today for more
than 1,000 employees of the Texas Education Agency.
   But Clements said Monday the matter likely would have no
immediate impact.
   ``We don't really have a problem,'' he said. ``We have ample
funds and the funds are in hand to pay the teachers until, I
believe, it's the last two days of the school year.''
   Some school districts would not be able to meet financial
obligations if state funding stops, Ms. Potter said.
   ``That's a very serious situation. It hurts the employees. It
hurts the kids,'' she said. ``They've been playing around with the
issue and using the kids as political pawns, and we're tired of
it.''
   The predominantly Democratic Legislature and Republican governor
have had seven months to deal with the court-ordered reform. The
Supreme Court on Oct. 2, 1989, ruled the school finance system
unconstitutional, but Clements didn't call the Legislature into
session to consider the matter until Feb. 27.

<HEAD>Mathematician With Brain Tumor Wants Head Frozen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mathematician who filed a lawsuit so he can
freeze his own head before he dies from a brain tumor said Tuesday
the odds of achieving immortality aren't as bad as one might think.
   ``We think that everyone should be immortal. The purpose of
medicine should be to bring about that immortality,'' Thomas
Donaldson said in a telephone interview from his home in Sunnyvale,
a Silicon Valley town south of San Francisco.
   Donaldson, 46, said he wants his head quick-frozen while he is
still alive, using a process known as cryonic suspension. He's
betting that future scientists will discover a way to cure the
tumor and attach his head to a healthy body.
   In a lawsuit filed Monday in Santa Barbara County Superior
Court, Donaldson seeks to bar state and local officials from
preventing his cryonic suspension before he is declared legally
dead.
   Donaldson said the choice to file the suit in Santa Barbara,
about 250 miles south of his home, was arbitrary.
   ``It's a nice area,'' he said. ``It's (really) a case against
the state of California.''
   Cryonic suspension is a procedure in which all or part of the
body is supposedly preserved in a deep freeze. Advocates of
cryonics say waiting for legal brain death hurts patients' chances
of successful reawakening.
   To date, the procedure only has been performed after a patient
has died of natural causes. Donaldson said he wants to secure the
right to have the procedure before the tumor significantly damages
his brain.
   ``I am dying and want to be cryonically suspended so that I
might later be revived and continue to live,'' said Donaldson, a
member of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, based in Riverside.
   In California, legal death is defined as when a person would not
show signs of brain activity as recorded by an
electroencephalograph.
   Alcor gained national attention in 1987 when the head of an
elderly woman was frozen after she died at the lab. Authorities
questioned whether her head was removed before she died.
   Donaldson says radiation treatment has not affected his tumor,
which was discovered in 1988. Court papers say that although the
tumor is stable, he has only a 40 percent chance of living to
August 1993.
   So he's filing suit now.
   ``The court system cannot be depended upon to decide these
things very fast,'' he said.
   Donaldson, a senior mathematician at MIMD Systems in Belmont,
hasn't decided where, if he succeeds, to have his cryonic
suspension done. But he says the Alcor lab in Riverside, about 55
miles east of Los Angeles, would be a logical place for suspension
and storage.
   In the procedure, he would be anesthetized while his body
temperature is reduced. Alcor surgeons then would replace his blood
with glycol and other chemicals to minimize tissue damage caused by
freezing.
   Donaldson's head would be surgically removed at the end of the
operation, then sealed in a vacuum container and maintained at
minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit. The operation would cost him $35,000.
   A full-body suspension costs about $100,000.
   Donaldson said he's been planning on cryonic suspension since
before he joined Alcor in 1975. His wife, Kathryn Woof, is all for
it. ``She's a cryonicist, too,'' he said.
   ``This is not a ritual. We're trying to improve the (chances of)
revival of the person we're suspending,'' he said.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles Times surpassed the New York
Daily News as the metropolitan newspaper with the nation's largest
weekday circulation, according to preliminary figures from the
Audit Bureau of Circulations.
   The Times weekday circulation for the six months ending March 31
rose by 90,237 to 1,210,077, according to ABC figures released
Monday. The New York Daily News decreased in weekday circulation
over the period by 50,047, to 1,180,139.
   Two national circulation newspapers, The Wall Street Journal and
USA Today, have larger weekday circulation figures than the Times,
registering 1,935,866 and 1,387,233, respectively.
   The Times' Sunday circulation rose by 81,230, to 1,504,540,
making it second-largest in the nation behind The New York Times,
which has a Sunday circulation of 1,706,013.
   The weekend edition of USA Today, published Fridays, sold
1,753,537 copies a week.
   About half the Times' circulation growth stemmed from the demise
of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, Times publisher David Laventhol
said. The Herald Examiner had a circulation of roughly 230,000 when
it closed in November.
   Perhaps up to 100,000 Herald Examiner subscribers already bought
a second newspaper, the ABC figures indicated. Of the remainder, an
estimated 50,000 to 70,000 may have stopped reading a daily
newspaper altogether, newspaper executives estimate.
   Of the rest, about two-thirds switched to the Los Angeles Times,
Laventhol estimated. Another 20,000 may have taken other
newspapers, particularly the Los Angeles Daily News.
   Daily News circulation rose by 19,044 on weekdays to 202,384,
and by 12,682 to 212,205 on Sundays.
   The Times quoted circulation experts as saying the Daily News
may have picked up about 10,000 former Herald Examiner readers.
   In Orange County, where the Times is locked in a readership
battle with the Orange County Register, the Times' weekday
circulation increased by 13,342 to 179,981. Total Register weekday
circulation rose 4,054 to 349,019.
   The Long Beach Press-Telegram's weekday circulation rose 4,614
to 134,071. More than half the increase came from the Herald
Examiner, said Dan Sidbury, vice president of circulation at the
Press-Telegram.
   Other newspapers reporting circulation increases included the
Copley Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Breeze in Torrance and
The Outlook in Santa Monica. The Copley Newspapers' circulation
rose 3,055 to 129,358.

<TEXT>
   Growing tensions between pro- and
anti-gambling factions on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation erupted
in sporadic gunfire overnight, and an Indian was fatally wounded on
the Canadian side, officials said.
   Matthew Pyke, 22, was shot in the back about 6:30 a.m. in Snye,
Quebec, and as he walked near a wooded area near the U.S.-Canadian
border, said Joe Lazore, a companion who went with Pyke to Alice
Hyde Hospital in Malone, N.Y.
   Pyke, who died about 11 a.m., was shot by gunfire from woods on
the U.S. side of the border, near the Salmon River, Lazore said.
   New York State Police Capt. Robert Currier said the incident
occurred on Canadian soil and his force will not participate in the
formal investigation. Quebec Provincial Police investigators could
not be reached by telephone.
   The reservation that straddles the border has been plagued in
recent weeks by feuding between anti- and pro-gambling factions.
   The dispute has been heightened by questions of whether the
reservation should be run by traditional or elected leaders and
whether state and federal laws can be enforced on Mohawk land.
   On Monday, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo attempted to ease tensions
by offering to renew negotiations over legalizing gambling on the
reservation, provided that the existing casinos were closed down
and the violence stopped.
   That proposal angered anti-gambling forces and pleased the
pro-gambling side. Indians reported periodic gunfire late Monday
and early Tuesday on the reservation.

   Celebrities joined forces Tuesday with the
American Association of Retired Persons and the American Bar
Association to launch a campaign urging the elderly to stand up for
their rights.
   ``If you're told Medicare won't pay a bill, you don't have to
take `No' for an answer,'' author Alex Haley declares in one of
five 30-second TV public service announcements shown to reporters.
   The radio and television spots, each focusing on a legal right
that many older Americans don't know they have, are the centerpiece
of the ``Do Yourself Justice ... Know Your Rights'' program.
   In other segments, actors Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach discuss
nursing home rights and Cliff Robertson tells of legal options to
state guardianship in the event of incapacity.
   Actress Celeste Holm does double-duty as spokeswoman on spots
describing legal protection against age discrimination in credit
and employment.
   ``Older Americans who do not know their rights are often targets
of abuse,'' Judith N. Brown, a member of the AARP's national board,
said in a statement. ``This campaign encourages older people to
stand up for themselves.''
   Radio stations are being offered 30-second and 60-second public
service announcements on the same five topics, plus three others:
telephone service, funerals and health insurance.
   Spanish versions are available for both television and radio,
all recorded by actress Rita Moreno.
   ``Generally speaking, older people are more vulnerable and less
able to speak up for their rights,'' said John H. Pickering,
chairman of the ABA's Commission on Legal Problems of the Elderly.
   ``We try to alert lawyers to the need to help the elderly. It's
a growing field in the law,'' Pickering said in an interview.
   The AARP, an advocacy and research group for people 50 and
older, is hoping the announcements will get extensive airplay for a
year or more, said spokesman Ted Bobrow.
   The brief spots allow little time for detail, but each ends with
the suggestion that anyone needing more information write for more
information to: Do Yourself Justice, Washington, D.C. 20049.

   Manhattan's borough president is in no
sentimental mood about a proposed statue in which jazz great Duke
Ellington and his piano are held aloft by naked women.
   Borough President Ruth Messinger asked Mayor David Dinkins on
Monday to cancel city funds for the monument at the northeast
corner of Central Park.
   ``We think we can find a better use for the $450,000,'' said
Messinger's spokesman Andrew Breslau, who also called the statue
``aesthetically suspect.'' Dinkins said Tuesday the city actually
planned to spend only $100,000 for installation. The rest is for
improvements to a traffic island where the statue would be
displayed.
   ``The current sculpture is the third version by Robert Graham. I
don't know if this is the final one,'' he said.
   Statue supporters sniffed at their opponents, saying these are
sophisticated ladies, not tramps.
   ``We chose the artist and we are very pleased with the statue,''
pianist Bobby Short said. ``I believe in it.''
   Short helped to raise nearly $1 million in private funds for the
monument.
   Graham's proposal is for a bronze staue nearly three stories
high.
   Graham, whose works are at such places as the Museum of Modern
Art and the Whitney Museum, attracted some controversy at the
Olympic games in Los Angeles in 1984 with his two massive, headless
male and female nude figures.
   The Duke Ellington Society issued a statement: ``Beautiful women
were always an important component in the life and work of Duke
Ellington, so naturally, the sculptor made them an integral
component of his work.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish studies will soon be taught at a Soviet
university for the first time in a half century, it was announced
Tuesday.
   The program _ the result of an agreement to be signed on
Wednesday _ is expected to start in the fall of 1991.
   Students will attend the Moscow State Institute of History and
Archives for three years, and will spend a fourth year in New York
at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and the YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research.
   Professors from the American institutions also will teach in
Moscow.
   This is believed to be the first time a Soviet state university
and American institutions have created a joint degree-granting
program, according to Tammy Kornfeld, a spokeswoman for the
seminary.
   Creators of the program hope that graduates will help catalog
the vast amount of Jewish manuscripts that are now surfacing in the
Soviet Union. The Moscow State Institute has launched an effort to
locate those materials and make them available to scholars.
   Other graduates of the program are expected to become teachers
and scholars of Judaica, as well as intellectual leaders of the
Soviet Jewish community, according to David Fishman, who conceived
of the program.
   The Moscow State Institute ``represents the best of the Soviet
intelligentsia,'' said Fishman, an assistant professor of Jewish
history at the seminary and research associate at YIVO.
   ``It is a pleasure to be in partnership with a faculty that has
been at the forefront of the movement for democracy and is
outspoken in its condemnation of anti-Semitism,'' he said.

   Vice President Dan Quayle called Tuesday
for savings from reduced defense spending to be channeled into
space-related research.
   ``Investing in space is especially important in light of the
decline in our military spending,'' he told the American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics in a luncheon speech.
   The vice president recalled that much past investment in
military research and development has had civilian benefits.
   ``Thanks to the promising trend toward a more peaceful and less
threatening world, it does appear our defense spending will
decline,'' said Quayle, who is the head of the National Space
Council.
   ``To ensure that we continue to benefit from research and
development in advanced technologies, we therefore need to continue
and expand our investment in space-related research,'' he said.
   Quayle praised the government-private industry partnership that
made possible the recent successful launch of the Pegasus. The
Pegasus is a payload-carrying rocket launched from under the wing
of an airplane.
   ``Soon, small commercial satellites will open a trillion dollar
industry supplying additional new informatin services from space _
services such as cellular telephones, worldwide TV and computer
services and much more,'' he said.
   ``Think what this could mean to a developing nation. It could
skip the entire cost of stringing wires and other infrastructure
expenses, and still develop state of the art communications
services.''
   The next century, said Quayle, will provide new medicines and
medical understandings from research and manufacturing in space.
   ``Material from the moon could enable us to supply many of the
Earth's energy needs safely and cleanly from space,'' he said. The
reference apparently was to helium-3, in abundant supply on the
moon, which, in gaseous form could be used to power fusion reactors
on Earth.

<BYLINE>Administration, Airlines Oppose Aging Airliner Bill
^By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and
airline industry joined forces Tuesday to oppose legislation that
would increase the federal role in inspecting aging airliners.
   Anthony Broderick, FAA associate administrator, told a House
hearing that the bill would increase government liability and could
cost between $1 million and $2 million per aircraft.
   It would take five years to hire and train the needed
inspectors, he said.
   FAA inspectors oversee regular checks and maintenance conducted
by the airlines but don't routinely dismantle and inspect airliners
themselves.
   The hearing of the House Public Works aviation subcommittee came
two years and two days after an 18-foot section of the roof ripped
off an aging Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 in flight over Hawaii,
sweeping a flight attendant to her death. That incident prompted
new concern about aging airliners and led to a government-industry
task force that planned FAA response to the problem.
   The average U.S. airliner is nearly 13 years old, and more than
one-fourth of the planes are more than 20 years old. That's
expected to increase as growing demand keeps aircraft from being
retired.
   The bill proposed by Democratic and Republican leaders of the
aviation subcommittee would require the FAA to thoroughly inspect
each airliner during the last year of its economic design life,
which could vary with each aircraft according to how it is used.
   Unless approved in an FAA inspection, planes would be grounded
after they reach the pre-determined design life.
   The bill would fundamentally change the way FAA works to ensure
aviation safety, replacing airline inspections with FAA
inspections, Broderick told the panel.
   ``This proposed departure from traditional practices troubles us
quite a bit,'' he said.
   He said the FAA workload in the first year would be something
``almost impossible to contemplate conducting, as we would be
required to inspect over 1,000 aircraft _ a task that is simply
unrealistic.''
   Broderick said the FAA is already having a difficult time coping
with its inspection duties because of rapid growth of the industry.
   Since the Aloha accident, the FAA has changed its approach to
airline aging from one of requiring frequent inspections to
mandating changes of critical parts of aircraft when they reach a
set number of cycles, or takeoffs and landings.
   ``I feel strongly that the agency's aging aircraft program
represents the best thinking and cooperative efforts of government
and industry,'' Broderick said.
   Robert E. Doll, United Airlines vice president who heads the
government-industry task force, said adding inspection duties for
the FAA could impinge other safety efforts of both the airlines and
the government.
   He said the possibility of increased liability for the
government could bring extensive disassembly and exhaustive
inspections of planes that would ``lead to repair costs so great as
to provoke the premature retirement of airworthy airplanes.''
   That, Doll said, could lead to a shortage of aircraft as the
demand for air travel grows.
   He said it would also be very difficult to determine the design
life of each aircraft because some parts are sensitive to flight
hours, others to flight cycles and still others to calendar age.
   Doll proposed, however, that the FAA increase its attention to
new air carriers to ensure that they have adequate inspection and
maintenance programs.

<HEAD>Bush Declares War on `Couch Potatoes'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush declared ``war on couch
potatoes'' Tuesday as he kicked off National Physical Fitness and
Sports Month by golfing, pedaling, shooting baskets and tossing
horseshoes on the White House grounds.
   It was all part of a celebrity-studded ``Great American
Workout,'' as Bush called the event.
   The White House lawn was transformed into a virtual outdoor
gymnasium as Bush took a turn at demonstrating sports activities
with well-known athletes and his own national fitness chairman,
muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   ``Read my hips, no more flab,'' Schwarzenegger said in a
take-off on the president's ``Read my lips, no new taxes,'' pledge.
   He and Bush made the rounds of a series of sports stations on
the South Lawn as sports stars and celebrities pumped iron, bounced
in aerobic routines and demonstrated martial arts and cross-country
skiing techniques.
   Among the sports boosters on hand were Olympic track stars Carl
Lewis and Jackie Joyner Kersee; fitness veteran Jack LaLanne, in a
skin-hugging purple jumpsuit, and `Saturday Night Live'' comedian
Kevin Nealon, in tight sweatsuit over fake muscles from his ``pump
you up'' comedy routine.
   ``Today we're declaring war on couch potatoes,'' Bush told the
group.
   The president said he hoped his use of the potato analogy didn't
get him in trouble with growers. He raised a furor in the broccoli
industry recently when he said he hated the vegetable.
   Bush urged Americans to eat a better diet than his own.
   ``Let's pledge to eat a balanced and nutritional diet, avoid
excessive alcohol use and of course, say no to drugs,'' Bush said.
``All you broccoli lovers, eat your heart out out there.''
   He said that,``All of us have a stake in making exercise a part
of America's fitness, and fitness a part of America every day.
   ``No matter what your age, sex or physical condition, the Great
American Workout can enhance the quality and longevity of each
American's life.''
   The president, clad in sport jacket and open-necked shirt for
the early-morning event, did not use the occasion for a full
workout, instead stopping for token demonstrations.
   When he failed to make a basket, the hoop was lowered so he
could dunk the basketball without jumping.
   The president tossed a wobbly football pass to Indianapolis
Colts star Eric Dickerson, and tried his hand at a couple of chip
shots, demonstrating his admitted weakness in golf.
   Turning to one of his better sports, he threw two horseshoes
that landed close to the stake, then chided Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan for a weak throw the president
dubbed a ``power outage.''
   Bush and Schwarzenegger climbed aboard Life Cycles for a few
minutes. He also hit some tennis balls with one of his favorite
partners, professional Pam Shriver, and joined briefly in a
volleyball game.
   Bush teased Schwarzenegger, whom he has appointed chairman of
the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
   ``He's stronger than I thought he was. He bench pressed the
federal budget,'' the president said of the body builder turned
actor.
   Also on hand were Special Olympics participants, local physical
fitness and martial arts students and teams, and military fitness
demonstrators.
   Among the celebrity participants were Olympic athletes Bruce
Jenner and Rafer Johnson, golfer Sam Snead, ice skaters Scott
Hamilton and Dorothy Hamill, Olympic gold medal gymnast Mary Lou
Retton, Charles Mann of the Washington Redskins, country singer
Randy Travis, and tennis stars Stan Smith and Arthur Ashe.
   Schwarzenegger warmed up the group with stretching exercises,
mercilessly cheering on the laggards.
   ``OK, General Powell, much further,'' he needled the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin Powell.

   A strong earthquake shook south-central
Alaska on Tuesday. There were no immediate reports of any damage or
injuries, authorities said.
   The quake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale and struck at 8:15
a.m., the Alaska Tsunami Center said.
   It was centered about 10 miles south of King Salmon, said Wayne
Jorgenson, a spokesman for the center. King Salmon is a village of
530 people about 280 southwest of Anchorage.
   ``Everbody's felt it,'' Jorgenson said. ``We received calls from
Homer, Kenai, Palmer and Anchorage.''
   He said there was no danger of a tsunami _ tidal waves that can
be generated by quakes.
   Lori Hyde, a spokeswoman for The Alaska State Troopers in
Naknek, said she didn't feel the quake even though the epicenter
was 25 miles away.
   ``There have been no damage reports,'' she said. ``People have
been calling to say they were shook up, that their chandeliers were
swaying. But there's nothing 10 miles south of King Salmon but
tundra.''
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

   Tens of thousands of protesters in Red Square
unleashed their fury at Mikhail S. Gorbachev Tuesday, turning the
traditional May Day parade into an outpouring of complaints about
the economy and the blockade of Lithuania.
   The Soviet president has allowed free debate in the press and
politics and endured public criticism. But never before has he had
to personally face such an outburst of discontent over his
policies, from both right and left.
   The criticism included jeers to the faces of Soviet leaders.
   Gorbachev, 59, tapped his fingers on the parapet of the red
granite reviewing stand during the protest, showing his impatience,
but otherwise was impassive. He and the other officials left after
enduring the unofficial demonstrators for about 20 minutes, but it
was unclear if they were leaving in response to the protests.
   Neither Gorbachev nor any of the other Communist or government
leaders on the reviewing stand spoke to the crowd.
   Dozens of the demonstrators carried the yellow, red and green
national flags of the breakaway Lithuanian republic and shouted
``Shame!'' and ``Freedom For Lithuania!''
   Some waved their fists at the leaders, numbering about two
dozen, and shouted ``Resign!'' over the holiday music blaring from
loudspeakers.
   One caustic sign likened the Soviet leadership to Nicolae
Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator executed in December after a
popular uprising. ``Kremlin Ceausescus: From Armchairs to Prison
Beds,'' it read.
   The leaders clearly expected some criticism. They authorized the
unofficial demonstration, and took control of the traditional
parade that preceded it from local Communist Party and government
officials.
   But they likely did not expect the tone to be quite so angry or
the scale quite so large.
   Gorbachev's popularity has waned during his five years in office
because his reforms have failed to resolve chronic economic
problems. Many people believe supplies of food, housing and
consumer goods actually are worse under Gorbachev.
   He also is under fire for the blockade of oil, raw materials and
other goods he imposed on Lithuania to force the Baltic republic to
back off its March 11 declaration of independence.
   For decades, the Red Square rally on May Day has been an
orchestrated show of support for official policies. Entry onto Red
Square was rigidly controlled. This year, there was little of the
usual polite praise. Just about anyone could join the march on the
gray cobblestone stretching from the Historical Museum to the
multi-colored St. Basil's Cathedral.
   ``We are all so very tired of these formal galas, when long
before the holiday the lists of demonstration participants were put
out,'' said the official news agency Tass.
   Soviet leaders went on record this year as preferring a parade
like those before the 1917 revolution, when May Day was marked with
smaller, spontaneous affairs aimed at voicing workers' grievances
about the czarist regime.
   What they got instead were posters that declared, ``Down with
the Empire of Red Fascism,'' and ``Today a Blockade of Lithuania,
Tomorrow a Blockade of Moscow.'' The black flags of an anarchist
group stood out in the sea of colors.
   The wave of protesters continued to file through Red Square,
which holds about 50,000 marchers, for more than an hour after the
leaders left. Police gradually, and apparently gently, moved them
along. A few thousand trekked almost a mile to a square across from
Gorky Park to renew their demonstration.
   The nightly newscast ``Vremya'' noted briefly the raucous nature
of the unofficial protest and showed some of the marchers,
including a woman who appeared to be shaking her fist at the Soviet
leaders.
   ``The last minutes of the celebration were somewhat marred by
the actions of certain people, actions which were dissonant with
the general mood,'' the newscast said.
   There were also protests in Leningrad, the Soviet Union's
second-largest city and birthplace of the revolution. Marchers on
Palace Square waved banners that read, ``Communism is a Universal
Shame'' and ``Freedom for Lithuania,'' according to Leningrad
journalist Maxim Korzhov. They also demanded Gorbachev's
resignation.
   Tass said marchers in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev expressed
concern about the treatment of victims of the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear power plant accident. It said demonstrators in Alma Ata,
the capital of Kazakhstan, urged officials to close the
Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.
   A subway worker attending the Red Square parade as an official
guest said he was stunned.
   ``A revolution is a revolution. What else can I say?'' said the
worker, who identified himself only as Yuri.
   Even the official segment of the parade, which lasted 75
minutes, featured banners and speeches critical of the leadership's
policy, especially its plans to introduce a market economy.
   ``Enough Experiments, Let's Work!'' and ``Democracy is not
Demagoguery,'' two banners read.
   The conservative tone of some of the banners and speeches in the
official segment indicated that Gorbachev faces criticism not only
from reformers but from workers, who fear the transition to a
market economy will worsen their lives.
   Labor leaders demanded attention to their worries that economic
reforms will lead to price increases and unemployment.
   ``The basic reason for the crisis situation is that the
leadership of the party and the government have been chronically
late in putting into effect cardinal political and economic
measures,'' said Yevgeny Kablov, a doctor of technology.
   He appealed for strengthening state-run businesses facing
competition from cooperatives, the privately owned businesses that
some accuse of black-marketeering and price-gouging.
   Among those on the reviewing stand was newly elected Moscow
Mayor Gavriil Popov, a reform-minded economist who is critical of
Gorbachev. Popov's supporters in the Moscow City Council are
pushing to turn much of the capital's retail trade into private
hands.

   The haze cleared from Ireland's buses and
movie theaters Tuesday as the government cracked down on smoking.
   Authorities outlawed smoking in cinemas and buses and ordered
segregated smoking areas to be set up in government buildings,
trains, schools, libraries, hospitals, airports, supermarkets,
restaurants and art galleries.
   Health inspectors will make spot checks throughout the country,
with the power to fine offenders up to $160. Owners or managers
failing to enforce the ban can be fined up to $800.
   Restaurateurs were angered that the ban does not apply to pubs
or bars.
   ``There seem to be two laws,'' said Henry O'Neill, head of the
Restaurant Owners Association. ``Publicans (pubkeepers) have gone
into food in a major way yet they are not restricted. It is
unfair.''
   Ireland already bars tobacco advertising on radio and TV, and
the Health Department said it hopes ``the new laws will be the
final pieces in the jigsaw of the government's anti-smoking
policy.''
   Patrick MacNutt, a Galway University economics lecturer, said he
does not smoke but sees the ban as government interference.
   ``An individual right has been relegated to an imposed rule,''
MacNutt said.
   Richard Miller, director of the Dublin-based Edmund Burke
Institute which campaigns for individual rights, doubted the ban
would be enforced.
   He said it was introduced ``to satisfy the demand for
regulations and to enable Ireland to look modern, progressive and
trendy.''
   Irish smokers have declined to 27 percent of the population from
45 percent in 1975. A pack of 20 cigarettes costs $3.20, of which
the government takes 67 percent in taxes.

   Up to 700 Vietnamese children and young people
living in Southeast Asian refugee camps will be granted political
asylum in this country, Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Gene McNary announced Tuesday.
   The young people, described by immigration authorities as
unaccompanied by parents or adult relatives, were all under age 18
when they arrived at refugee camps. Some are now in their early 20s.
   The INS will begin interviewing the applicants this month to
screen them for political asylum, McNary said. The first refugees
from the group are expected to arrive in the United States in July
and the rest by year's end, McNary said in a statement.
   Immigration authorities said the young people were unable to
qualify as political refugees when previously interviewed because
they were too young or inarticulate at the time to provide evidence
of political persecution.
   Many of these young people and children have families still
living in Vietnam, including fathers who fought in the South
Vietnamese army during the Vietnam War, which ended 15 years ago.
   ``Their lives are in suspension and it seemed like an
appropriate time to go back and re-interview those people in the
most generous manner,'' said Ralph Thomas, deputy assistant INS
commissioner for refugee asylum and parole.
   ``We anticipate that the large bulk of them will be admitted as
refugees,'' Thomas said.
   Most of the children and young people are living in refugee
camps in Thailand; others are in the Philippines, Indonesia and
Hong Kong.
   Since the war ended, more than 1 million Vietnamese refugees
have been admitted to the United States.
   Some of the 700 young people have relatives living in this
country, authorities said.
   McNary said he hopes the initiative will set an example for
other nations to implement the Comprehensive Plan of Action, an
international agreement for resettling Indochinese refugees.

<TEXT>
   The Colombian navy found 1,320 pounds of
cocaine stashed aboard a small freighter off the Caribbean coast, a
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The cocaine was found aboard the freighter Sandra, the newspaper
El Tiempo quoted Adm. Angel Mejia as saying. The ship reportedly
was stopped near the Rosario Islands about 50 miles north of
Cartagena.
   It was not immediately possible to verify the story because
Tuesday was a holiday in Colombia, May Day. The Defense Ministry in
Bogota and the navy's public affairs offices at its main base in
Cartagena were closed.
   El Tiempo did not say when the cocaine was found.

<HEAD>Convicted HUD Swindler Sentenced to Six Years, Fined $2 Million</HEAD>

   A man who stole $2 million in federal
housing funds and used the money to buy sports cars, furs and
jewelry, was sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison and ordered
to pay $4 million in fines and restitution.
   Cy Walker, a 50-year-old former Montgomery real estate broker,
was ordered to report to prison June 1 for embezzling $2 million
from an unwitting U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
during a 21-month period in 1986-87.
   U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson said Walker was not connected to
high-level HUD officials in any kind of conspiracy. But, he said,
``the fact that Walker could have pulled this off is indicative of
the weaknesses of the HUD program'' during the Reagan
administration.
   ``It was a part of the HUD scandal, but it was done by an
isolated operator,'' said Wilson.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina sentenced Walker to five years
in prison for one count of embezzlement of HUD funds. The judge
sentenced Walker to an additional year, to run consecutively, on a
count of failing to pay income tax on the stolen HUD money.
   Walker was fined $2 million on the first count and $25,000 on
the second. The judge also ordered restitution to the government of
$2,073,499 in HUD money, which Walker admitted using to bankroll
lavish purchases, such as $180,000 worth of cars, including a
$50,000 Mercedes-Benz, and an $18,000 Stingray speedboat.
   His attorney, David Byrne, said Walker isn't able to pay the $4
million: ``He doesn't have any present resources to make
restitution.''
   He said Walker had no comment about the six-year sentence, at an
as yet undesignated prison. But he said Walker ``expressed his
sorrow for what he had done and most of all for the disappointment
he caused his parents and loved ones.''
   Walker, a real estate broker who had a HUD contract to handle
closings of agency property in the Montgomery region, admitted
embezzling the money between February 1986 and October 1987.
According to a HUD audit, he put agency property closing money in a
personal bank account, then falsified a bank's wire transfer forms
to make regional HUD officials think it had been sent for proper
deposit in a HUD account.
   When HUD inspectors discovered the scheme, Walker depleted the
account and closed down his office. Later, as investigators pursued
him, he worked out a deal with prosecutors, agreeing to serve as an
informant in a drug sting operation. His testimony led to the
conviction of east Alabama racehorse trainer Freddie Hyatt. Before
the Hyatt trial, prosecutors agreed to let Walker plead guilty to
two counts in the HUD embezzlement case.
   The prosecutor said he felt the judge imposed a ``very fair and
good sentence'' on Walker, particularly in requiring full
restitution of the embezzled money and more than $2 million in
fines.
   ``We're going to pursue these amounts,'' said Wilson. ``Whatever
we can find and legally recover.''

<HEAD>House OKs Bill to Raise Pay for Medical Personnel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday approved a bill to raise
the pay of doctors, dentists and nurses who work for the Veterans
Affairs Department.
   The bill, approved by voice vote and sent to the Senate, is in
response to problems the department has had in recruiting medical
personnel.
   The legislation would increase typical physicians' pay from just
under $100,000 to a maximum around $130,000, depending on
experience and specialities.
   Dentists earning about $65,000 would see their pay increase to a
range of $70,000 to $100,000, with most toward the lower end.
   Salaries for health executives could go up by $45,000.
   The pay structure governing the more than 10,000 nurses and
15,000 nursing assistants in the veterans' care system also would
be revamped, including a provision allowing local area
administrators to increase pay to attract adequate staff. The
actual salaries would vary widely depending on experience, training
and region.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add
nearly $60 million in costs to the government in 1991, rising to
$108 million in 1995.
   Instead of including some method for paying for the increases,
the legislation includes a provision exempting the VA health care
system from the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.

   Rock star Prince previewed his
forthcoming European tour by performing a benefit concert for the
family of his former bodyguard, who died April 2 of heart failure.
   The 650-ticket sellout show Monday at the suburban nightclub
Rupert's attracted fans who paid $100 a ticket and waited more than
an hour in freezing temperatures to get inside.
   Proceeds will benefit the family of Charles ``Big Chick''
Huntsberry, who gained fame in the mid-'80s as Prince's bodyguard
before turning to Christian evangelism.
   Jill Willis, a publicist for the rock star, said Prince decided
to combine the benefit with a run-through of his forthcoming
``Nude'' tour of Europe. The name of the tour refers to its
``stripped-down rock 'n' roll,'' she said.
   Prince's tour is scheduled to open in Rotterdam June 2 and will
continue through early August, including 15 sold-out dates at
Wembley Arena in London.

   Prince Aya, second son of Emperor Akihito, will
marry graduate student Kiko Kawashima on June 29, the Imperial
Household Agency said Tuesday.
   An agency official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
messenger from the emperor will call on Miss Kawashima, 23, and her
parents at their home on May 11 to formally notify them of the
wedding date.
   The government plans to spend about $1 million on the wedding of
Miss Kawashima and the 24-year-old Aya, second in line to the
throne after his elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito. The crown
prince, 30, is unmarried.
   Prince Aya, who graduated from Gakushuin University in 1988, is
studying zoology at Oxford's St. John's college in Britain. He is
expected to complete his studies there and return to Tokyo on June
20.
   Aya and Miss Kawashima met five years ago on the campus of
Gakushuin University. Miss Kawashima, the daughter of a Gakushuin
professor, is taking graduate courses in psychology at the Tokyo
university.
   The couple announced their engagement in September.

   Country music star Hank Williams Jr. has
asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down ``feel-good
jurisprudence'' that gave his half-sister a claim to the estate of
their famous father.
   Williams' lawyers contended in the filing last month that the
state Supreme Court gave a share of the late country music Hank
Williams Sr.'s estate to his illegitimate daughter, Jett Williams,
even though the estate had been closed since 1975.
   Williams also asked the court to hear an appeal of a New York
appeals court that, relying on the Alabama case, gave Ms. Williams
a share of continuing music royalties stemming from songs written
by her father.
   Hank Williams Sr. died five days before his daughter was born in
1953 to Bobbie Jett. The Alabama court noted that her paternity was
not suggested to her until 1974, when she was a 21-year-old
University of Alabama student.
   For the next few years, her efforts to get documents from the
state were thwarted because the case had been sealed, along with
evidence that lawyers had been setting aside part of Hank Williams
Sr.'s estate for her.
   She launched her music career under the name Jett Williams,
although she is identified in court documents as Catherine Yvonne
Stone.

   The hunk flunked ... again.
   John F. Kennedy Jr., who's made magazine covers touting him as
sexy and an heir to the Kennedy dynasty, took the state bar
examination for a second time. Again, he failed.
   ``I'm clearly not a major legal genius,'' he told reporters
Monday.
   So Tuesday's city tabloids had headlines screaming about him
going belly up on the bar exam. Undaunted, Kennedy said he would
take the test again and again ``until I'm 95'' _ or until he passes.
   The 29-year-old son of the late President Kennedy has only one
more chance to pass the grueling 12{-hour, two-day test if he wants
to keep his job as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan.
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau, said Kennedy, a prosecutor since August, will be asked
to resign from his $30,000-a-year post if he fails again.
   ``All assistants get three chances,'' Roche said. ``It's a
longstanding office policy. He will take it again in July.''
   Kennedy fell 11 points short of the passing score of 660 out of
1,000 points, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kennedy, a graduate of the New York University Law School, first
took the bar exam last July with 64 other new members of
Morgenthau's staff, Roche said. Of the 65, she said, Kennedy was
one of seven who flunked.
   He took the test again in February along with those who failed.
Of the seven, at least two passed on the second go-round.

   Simon Townshend thinks the day is coming
when rock 'n' roll fans will have a Townshend other than his big
brother Pete to admire.
   ``I did my work in the same way that Pete did,'' the 29-year-old
guitarist said as he prepared for a club date in Nashville.
   ``A lot of people think that was a gift that Pete passed onto
me,'' he said, noting it takes more sweat than favors to get a
musical career off the ground. ``I intend to prove myself, however
long it takes.''
   His big brother is a tough act to follow. Pete is a guitarist
for The Who and as composer of such rock classics as ``Tommy.''
Simon's mainstream rock band has an album partly recorded in
Nashville nearing release.
   Simon was 14 when he began his music career by recording ``When
I'm a Man'' for Warner Bros. in England.
   ``A friend of my Dad's said, `Why don't we put Simon in the
studio and make a record?''' he recalled. ``I suppose in a way it
was trying to cash in on the family name and make a quick buck.''

   For the first time in years, there's more
than one person running for the lowly office of tree warden, but
it's not exactly what you'd call a heated contest.
   A 66-year-old retiree and a 34-year-old construction worker say
they think they've got the timber for the job. But neither seems to
be overly concerned about winning the May 15 election for the
$700-a-year job.
   ``I ain't running no campaign at all. The other fellow, he's not
campaigning, either,'' said Edward Yagodzinski, a retired
groundskeeper and truck driver.
   His opponent, Brent Higgins, took an equally dispassionate
approach: ``A few people said `why don't you put your name in for
it,' so I said `all right.'''
   Higgins said he has some experience cutting down trees in his 14
years as a construction worker, but he wasn't willing to say
whether he'd make a better tree warden than Yagodzinski.
   ``Whoever wins, wins,'' he said.
   Trees are an important part of the rural charm of this town of
3,500 just outside Northampton in the western part of the state.
The warden is responsible for maintaining trees along the streets
and organizing public hearings before any cutting takes place.
   Like Higgins, Yagodzinski seemed ready to face the prospect of
defeat.
   ``If I get in, all well and good. If I don't I'm not going to
worry about it. I'll do more fishing up in Vermont,'' he said.

   Didja hear the one about the cop who tried
a little stand-up comedy routine before giving a motorist a
speeding ticket?
   A Montana teen-ager wants you to. Michelle Kessinger of Columbia
Falls offered a bill in a mock student legislature that would
require police officers issuing speeding tickets to tell a little
joke to break the tension.
   Or else.
   The bill mandates law officers ``start off with a joke to
lighten the mood'' when issuing speeding tickets. That would
alleviate tension and reduce the chance that a nervous motorist
carrying a firearm will do something dangerous, she said.
   The bill would appropriate $5,000 ``to educate all law officers
on comical anecdotes and humorous jokes that are in good taste,
non-offending and somewhat pertinent to the situation.''
   The humor could be a little forced, however. Officers who fail
to tell jokes could be fined $10 and up per ticket.

   The State Department's $1 billion program to
upgrade embassies around the world could run into trouble with
shrinking budgets and new demands in Eastern Europe and Central
America, officials said Tuesday.
   ``Our biggest challenge in the 1990s may be working within the
shrinking budget,'' Arthur Fort, assistant secretary of State for
administration, told a congressional panel.
   ``We have identified an unfunded capital backlog in the program
of approximately $2.5 billion for construction requirements to
which we must add new demands in Central America and Eastern
Europe,'' Forte said
   He said those changes ``will place increased demand on our
facility requirements. We must respond to these new challenges with
a fresh look at what we do and how we do it.''
   Soaring maintenance costs, high land prices in some areas and
construction problems in other areas are also straining the budget,
officials told the panel.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, asked, for instance, why the
department is buying 14 acres of land in Kuwait for $32 million, a
price she said seemed exorbitant.
   Fort agreed ``it's a staggering price,'' but said real estate
prices in the oil-rich Persian Gulf nation dictated the cost.
   ``Costs of land in Kuwait are about the highest in the world,''
said Richard Dertadian, deputy assistant secretary for foreign
buildings.
   And they said if the State Department fails to sign a contract
by July, the price could soar to over $40 million. The United
States can't remain where it is past 1996 because the current
embassy site is leased
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on international operations, said the existing
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait is a security risk.
   Dymally said he recently traveled to Kuwait and said that from
his hotel room, he could have shot the No. 2 official in the
embassy with a pistol.
   The embassy is a ``ripe target for terrorist activities,'' he
said.
   The officials told the hearing that about half of the $1 billion
that Congress allocated to the department for the worldwide embassy
project remains unspent. But they said they expect that money to be
in the pipeline by the end of 1991. After that the department faces
a crunch, they said.
   The officials said the department has 47 construction projects
underway around the world in a renovation program that began in the
mid-1980s.
   Eighteen projects are in construction, 18 are being designed and
11 are in site aquisition.
   The program stemmed from a worldwide review of embassy sites by
an advisory panel looked at the condition of buildings and their
vulnerability to attack.

   Weekly box-office figures supplied by movie
studios are sometimes as accurate as an old-fashioned Chicago vote
count, say insiders, including some who admit to fudging the
numbers to get ahead.
   Making movies is more competitive than ever these days, and the
charts that rank them as hot or flops represent free and, some
think, persuasive advertising.
   So why not crunch the numbers extra hard?
   ``It's gotten really out of hand,'' said an executive at one
major studio who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``I used to think
that the independents were the only people who (cheated). But
that's not true anymore.''
   Here's how it works:
   Big studioslike Paramount and Disney and independents such as
Miramax and New Line base their weekend grosses on surveys of about
75 percent of North America's movie houses. The polling, for the
most part, is conducted by telephone by Entertainment Data Inc.
   But drive-ins, Spanish-language theaters and some small theaters
and movie houses in Hawaii are not surveyed _ and that's the key.
   Let's say ``Ghostbusters 27: The Revenge of Casper'' collected
$4.5 million at the screens surveyed by EDI. ``Honey, I Enlarged
the Kids'' made $4.3 million, EDI says.
   Estimating ticket sales from the 25 percent of theaters not
surveyed by EDI, ``Ghostbusters'' could report a correct final take
of $5 million. The makers of ``Honey,'' not wanting to land in
second place, could rewrite the figures for the 25 percent for
their movie to show it received $5.1 million.
   And just like that, ``Honey'' ads appearing in newspapers the
next day read: ``The Nation's No. 1 Movie!''
   ``There is a lot of temptation to want to be in the top five,''
said Art Murphy, who analyzes box-office figures for the trade
publication Variety.
   He believes that tinkering has become commonplace but that any
large-scale manipulation would be easily detected.
   Said an executive from one top studio: ``It's just a little
game. ... You want to have a film in Top 10, but it's better to
have it in the Top 5. ... It's an independent promotional vehicle.''
   Said another studio number-cruncher: ``Sometimes the pressure is
incredible.''
   Every Monday, the studios figure up their admission estimates.
The numbers are compiled by EDI and Exhibitor Relations Co., which
relay them to a variety of news organizations, including The
Associated Press.
   ``It's not our job to police the studio's (final) numbers,''
said Phil Garfinkle, EDI senior vice president.
   At the very least, a high box-office placement keeps a title in
the public's eye. Oscar voters might forget a film that's no longer
on the leader board. Ancillary markets can be affected, too. A
producer pushing a film for home video can say to prospective video
distributors: ``But `When Perry Met Polly ...' did $1 million its
first weekend!''
   ``The box office grosses are very important today as a
promotional tool because there is a tremendous amount of public
interest in what is hot,'' said Martin Grove, business columnist
for the Hollywood Reporter.
   Creative accounting is a staple of Hollywood bookkeeping, but
the box-office figures had always been somewhat sacred, like the
Nielsen TV ratings or publishing's best-seller lists.
   When Taurus reported not long ago that the low-budget
exploitation film ``Angel Town'' made $300,000 in its opening
weekend, the figure looked strange: The movie was making more
per-screen ($5,455) than ``Driving Miss Daisy'' or the Steven
Seagal hit ``Hard to Kill.''
   How did Taurus explain the film's gross? ``I added the numbers
up seven times and I always got a different figure, so I just said
$300,000,'' said a Taurus executive who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the film had done solid business in drive-ins and
Spanish-language houses.
   Universal and Fox locked horns in late February when Universal's
``Born on the Fourth of July'' and Fox's ``Nightbreed'' nearly tied
for fifth place, with ``Born'' winning on the final tally. Both
studios insisted the numbers were fair and cried trickery.
   Explained one studio executive: ``Anybody in this end of the
business can go down those numbers and tell you who's exaggerating
and who's not and by how much they're exaggerating.''

<HEAD>Administration Links Salvadoran Aid to Human Rights Performance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration opened the door to a
new, more restrictive policy toward El Salvador on Tuesday,
agreeing in principle to link future U.S. aid to specific progress
toward peace and human rights.
   At a Senate hearing and later in private meetings with
lawmakers, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the
administration would be willing to attach strings to future aid,
including progress toward bringing to justice the killers of six
Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   ``This case has got to become a turning point in the history of
El Salvador,'' Baker told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
foreign aid. ``Our assistance is going to be affected by the way
this case is handled. It's fair to say the government of El
Salvador understands that.''
   The secretary expanded on that offer in later private meetings,
participants said, opening talks with Congress aimed at crafting a
bipartisan U.S. policy toward El Salvador, where a civil war with
leftist rebels has raged for a decade.
   ``The administration is willing to involve themselves in
applying some pressure to both the FMLN (rebels) and the
government,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a member of the
House majority leadership. ``That is heartening.''
   ``I think the elements for an agreement are there,'' said Rep.
William Broomfield, R-Mich., the senior GOP member of the Foreign
Affairs Committee. ``We are very close to an agreement. There is
agreement that conditionality is important.''
   While participants said Baker offered no specific numbers, an
administration source said he might agree to making 25 percent of
military aid contingent on human rights and peace progress.
   Baker's gesture was an indication that the administration
recognizes a growing movement on Capitol Hill to restrict aid to El
Salvador, which amounts to $315.4 million this year. Of that, $85
million is military aid. Bush has asked for $375 million next year,
$90 million of it in military assistance.
   A primary impetus has been the Jesuit slayings. Nine military
officials have been charged in the Nov. 16 murders, but a House
Democratic task force reported Monday that the investigation has
come to a virtual standstill and that Salvadoran authorities are
reluctant to follow leads that point to involvement of higher-ups
in the military.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted last week to withhold
half the military aid. The aid could be restored if the FMLN fails
to work in good faith toward peace at U.N.-sponsored negotiations.
It could be cut out entirely if the government fails to make
similar good-faith efforts.
   Bonior said that formula was ``generally agreeable'' to the
administration and to members of Congress in both parties. ``We
agree that pressure should be applied to both sides to keep them at
the table,'' he said after an hour-long meeting with Baker.
   Both sides agreed that whatever is done, the U.S. policy must be
compatible with the U.N.-sponsored peace talks and must lead to the
creation of ``political space'' that would allow the FMLN to
participate in national elections next march, Bonior said.
   Further meetings will be scheduled as the two sides seek to work
out an agreement similar to the bipartisan accord that revamped
U.S. policy toward Nicaragua a year ago.

<HEAD>Female Dispatcher Awarded $150,000 in Sexual Harassment Case</HEAD>

   A female police dispatcher has won
$150,000 in damages for years of sexual harassment by a male
superior, who once allegedly pulled down her clothing so another
officer could photograph her bared breast.
   Sydney Brauer, 38, of Macomb County's Bruce Township, said the
harassment by Sgt. Robert White began in 1981 with unwanted neck
massages, then escalated into tickling, unhooking of her bra and
the 1984 photo incident.
   ``I didn't do anything wrong,'' Brauer said. ``But I was trying
to change things since 1981 when it started.''
   An attorney for White said the incidents were ``good-spirited
horseplay.''
   The jury award Monday includes $90,000 from White for harassment
and intentional infliction of emotional distress and $30,000 from
Romeo for letting the incidents continue.
   The Macomb County Circuit Court jury also ordered retired Police
Chief Paul Uerling to pay $30,000 for retaliating against her by
criticizing her work when she filed a complaint in 1987.
   The jury also awarded $11,000 to Anne Graber, 25, of Romeo, a
former dispatcher who testified that White threw coins down her
blouse and that on her birthday in 1986, White grabbed her and
tried to kiss her passionately.
   White, who refused to comment about the verdict, denied both
women's charges. He said the photographing incident occurred when
he had his hand on Brauer's shoulder and her blouse accidentally
slipped, baring the woman's breast.
   Brauer, a 17-year employee, and another officer, Douglas Wills,
testified White intentionally exposed Brauer's breast.
   Charles Gerlach, Brauer's attorney, said the ``physical'' sexual
harassment stopped only after Brauer announced she was pregnant,
but verbal harassment ensued.
   Gerlach said White, a 23-year veteran of the force who lives in
Romeo, made crude remarks about Brauer's weight gain and eating
habits and berated her for being a working mother.
   Defense attorney Mary Cauley characterized the alleged
harassment as horseplay.
   ``The breast incident ended it because Sergeant White thought it
was getting out of hand,'' Cauley said. ``It was good-spirited
horseplay between friends. She didn't object.''
   Romeo, a community of about 3,500 people, is about 30 miles
north of Detroit.

   Israeli officials on Tuesday offered to free
Arab prisoners in exchange for three Israelis held captive in
Lebanon, but indicated they would not make a deal for Western
hostages alone.
   President Bush said Monday he had ``certainly no objection'' to
Israel freeing some of the thousands of prisoners it holds, a
goodwill gesture suggested by a Tehran newspaper.
   But Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said Israel had received no U.S. request for a prisoner release. He
responded ``certainly not'' when asked if he viewed Bush's remarks
as pressure.
   ``The United States has ways to convey its opinions to us. We
are in close touch always. We haven't been told anything of this,''
he said.
   Asked if Israel refused to free Arab detainees unless captive
Israelis were released, Pazner said he did not want to phrase his
comments in a ``negative way.''
   ``Our policy is to get our prisoners back and for that purpose
we are ready to consider the release of people detained here,'' he
said.
   Danny Naveh, spokesman for Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, said
Israeli captives were Israel's first priority. ``Our interest is to
release our hostages,'' he said.
   Three Israelis were captured in Lebanon in 1986 and are believed
held by radical Shiites linked to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah
militia. Six Americans and 10 other Westerners are held hostage in
Lebanon.
   The Israelis are Ron Arad, a navigator shot down over Sidon, and
soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh of the army's elite Givati
brigade captured in an ambush in southern Lebanon.
   Privately, officials said they interpreted Bush's comments as an
appeal, suggesting he could not make a more direct approach without
appearing to violate his stated policy of not making deals with
terrorists.
   Some also indicated Shamir was feeling increasing pressure to
assist the United States in ending the hostage ordeal. The U.S.
government gives Israel $3 billion a year in aid and they have a
strategic cooperation agreement.
   But there was no sign Israel was prepared to make such a move.
   ``It is inconceivable that Israel would agree to give up on any
of its assets in hand without Israeli prisoners being part of the
deal,'' a senior Israeli official told the mas-circulation Yediot
Ahronot.
   A decision to free Arab prisoners without getting Israelis in
return could stir angry protests as Shamir tries to form a
government that depends on right-wing nationalist and religious
factions.
   Yediot Ahronot quoted an Arab weekly newspaper as saying Israel
had told Washington there would be no release of Shiite prisoners
without a package deal that includes the captured Israelis.
   The most prominent prisoner Israel holds is Sheikh Abdul-Karim
Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric belonging to Hezbollah. Israel
captured Obeid and two assistants on July 28.
   Israel holds more than 5,000 Palestinians detained during the
28-month uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories.
About 1,300 are being held without trial in the Ketziot prison
located in the Negev desert.
   In addition, more than 300 Arab prisoners are held by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army at al-Khiam just north of the
Israeli-Lebanese border.
   Most of the al-Khiam inmates are Shiite Moslems. The best-known
is Jawad Kaswi, captured in 1988.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity said Israel pressured
SLA commander Antoine Lahd to cancel a planned release of prisoners
for the Id al-Fitr holiday April 26 because of publicity linking it
to the Western hostages.
   Apparently for the same reason, Israel refrained from freeing
Palestinian prisoners. The release is customary during Moslem
holidays.
   In recent years, Israel has engaged in lopsided prisoner
releases to gain the freedom of captured soldiers. The most
controversial was the May 1985 exchange worked out with the
pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command.
   Israel won the release of three soldiers by freeing nearly 1,100
Arabs, many of them convicted terrorists who have since been
re-arrested for anti-Israeli activism.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of workers and
students staged demonstrations throughout South Korea on Tuesday to
protest police raids that crushed strikes at a state broadcast
network and the nation's largest shipyard.
   Violent street protests broke out in Seoul and at least 17
provincial cities on the May Day labor holiday. Students and
workers at auto plants, subways, shipyards and broadcast stations
held rallies or clashed with riot police, hurling rocks and
firebombs.
   More than 80,000 people took part in Tuesday's protests, the
largest this year, news reports said.
   Police reported arrests and injuries but gave no overall
figures. In Seoul alone, about 150 people were arrested, bringing
to nearly 500 the number detained in the capital in the past four
days, reports said.
   Across the nation in that same period, authorities said 80
policemen and 14 workers were injured and nine workers formally
charged with instigating labor unrest.
   ``Crush (President) Roh Tae-woo who suppresses labor!'' yelled
hundreds of radical students hurling firebombs and rocks at riot
police outside Seoul's Yonsei University.
   The government said it perceived the current labor unrest as ``a
crisis.''
   ``We cannot help taking strong measures against the labor
protests, which have political overtones,'' Prime Minister Kang
Young-hoon said Tuesday after a meeting with aides and leaders of
the governing Democratic Liberal Party.
   Kang and other officials expressed concern that the already
slumping Korean economy might suffer further unless the unrest
eases. A prolonged labor dispute in 1987 slowed exports and led to
increased unemployment.
   Korean exports shrank 1.4 percent in the first quarter this year
and share prices on the Korean stock market took the biggest
single-day plunge ever on Monday, hitting an 18-month low.
   Wages are not a main issue in the current protests. Workers are
demanding the release of jailed union leaders and more freedom to
organize labor without government interference.
   Major protests were reported in the southeastern industrial city
of Ulsan, where police stormed the Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.
shipyard, the nation's largest, over the weekend to end a three-day
strike.
   The police action touched off four days of violent sympathy
protests by workers in Ulsan and other industrial regions.
   On Tuesday, about 4,000 workers in Ulsan, hurling rocks and
firebombs, fought police near the shipyard as an estimated 40,000
workers held rallies elsewhere in the city, reports said.
   A 41-year-old worker in Ulsan was seriously injured when he
leaped from the second floor of a house while being chased by
police.
   At the shipyard, about 50 militant workers were holding out atop
a 240-foot crane for the fourth day Tuesday. The workers fled there
when police raided the stike-bound shipyard last Saturday.
   At the nearby Hyundai Motor Co., the nation's largest car maker,
about 20,000 workers decided to extend until Sunday a sympathy
strike that began Monday and initially was scheduled for two days.
   The shipyard and the car plant are the main arms of the giant
Hyundai group, one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea,
which reported $4.8 billion in 1989 sales.
   In Seoul, hundreds of riot police guarded the state-run Korean
Broadcasting System headquarters, where 2,400 police staged a
midnight raid Monday to end a 19-day protest against the network's
new president. Police arrested 333 workers.
   Workers at the nation's only other network, the Munwha
Broadcasting Co., began a five-day sympathy strike on Tuesday,
virtually crippling the nation's broadcasting industry.
   Programming was curtailed at the three networks, five stations
and 19 local stations run by the two companies.
   The labor unrest spilled over to Citibank in Seoul, where
tellers refused to wear bank uniforms, instead donning T-shirts and
slacks to press their demand for freer labor activity.
   The capital's subway workers declared a two-day protest,
refusing to sell tickets and giving passengers free rides.
   In southern Chonju, dozens of radical students armed with steel
pipes and firebombs attacked a building where government party
officials were to meet and smashed windows, said Yonhap, the South
Korean news agency.

<HEAD>Baker Says Will Press On Seeking Israeli-Palestinian Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday that Palestinian Arabs would hold talks with Israel only
with the acquiesence of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   But Baker told a Senate appropriations subcommittee he was not
trying to force Israel to deal with Yasser Arafat's group.
   ``We are not involved in a process to bring the Israeli
government into a dialogue with the PLO,'' Baker said.
   Testifying on a wide range of foreign policy problems, Baker was
questioned closely by Sens. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., on whether he is trying to involve the PLO in
Mideast negotiations.
   ``That is not the case,'' Baker said.
   However, he added: ``It is our view that a dialogue will not
take place between Palestinians and Israel unless it is aquiesced
in by the PLO.''
   Baker's description of only limited PLO involvement in his
efforts to arrange the talks apparently left Kasten and Specter,
two of Israel's strongest supporters in Congress, unconvinced.
   ``If pressure were not applied on Israel on the PLO issue we
could move ahead,'' Specter said.
   He also told Baker he believed the administration hoped the PLO
could be involved in some way.
   ``I disagree,'' Baker said.
   At the same time, he said he intended to ``press on'' with his
effort to arrange Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   On Monday, Baker criticized Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir for not accepting his formula for the talks. Through his
spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, Baker said Shamir had missed an
opportunity to promote peace and his own initiaitve.
   Shamir proposed last May to hold elections among Palestinians on
the West Bank and in Gaza. The Baker formula the prime minister
refused to endorse involved having Palestinians who were ousted
from the West Bank or who resided in East Jerusalem in the
delegation.
   The Israeli government split over Baker's approach, and then
collapsed. Baker's vow to keep trying to find a solution coincides
with a continuing attempt by Shamir to form a new government.

<HEAD>Ohio Congressman Says U.S. Pressured German Scientist to Leave
Country</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. James Traficant believes U.S. officials
pressured a German rocket scientist to renounce his American
citizenship rather than face charges of Nazi war crimes, a
spokesman said Tuesday.
   Arthur Rudolph renounced his citizenship in 1984 under an
agreement with the Justice Department. Rudolph said his citizenship
was illegally obtained, agreeing to leave the country and never
return.
   Traficant spokesman H. West Richards said the Ohio Democrat
``believes pressure was put on Rudolph to renounce his
citizenship.''
   Neal Sher, head of the Office of Special Investigations at the
Justice Department, called the allegation absurd.
   Sher said Rudolph renounced his citizenship ``after much
deliberation, after consulting at length with his lawyer and after
signing an agreement in which he specifically conceded his
involvement in Nazi persecution.''
   The 84-year-old Ruldoph lives in Hamburg, West Germany. His
supporters in Huntsville, Ala., have scheduled a May 12 event at
which Traficant will speak.
   ``Traficant is the one man in Congress who has opened his eyes
to the methods used by the OSI and called them into question,'' the
Friends of Arthur Rudolph said in a statement.
   Rudolph was brought to the United States with more than 100
other German technicians and scientists after World War II to help
the United States develop space and armament programs.
   He became the manager of the Saturn 5 rocket program at the NASA
space center in Huntsville. The rocket was used to send astronauts
to the moon in 1969.
   From 1943 to 1945, Rudolph was production manager of a V-2
rocket factory attached to the Dora-Nordhausen concentration camp.
Slave labor from the camp was used in the factory.
   Rudolph told the OSI in 1983 that he knew that prisoners he
chose to work in the underground factory died of maltreatment.
   The OSI contends Rudolph ``participated, under the direction of
and on behalf of the Nazi government in Germany, in the persecution
of unarmed civilians because of their race, religion, national
origin or political opinion.''
   The OSI is looking into the files of other former participants
in the rocket program to see if any of them lied about their past.
   Supporters in Alabama, some of them former Nazi scientists, say
Rudolph served the United States loyally and when he was no longer
needed was intimidated and harassed until he left the country.
   Traficant also is championing the cause of John Demjanjuk, a
retired Cleveland-area auto worker condemned to death in Israel
after being convicted of committing Nazi atrocities.

   George H. Beebe, whose decades-long career helped
guide The Miami Herald to a position of prominence and developed
its role in coverage of Latin America, has died of cancer. He was
80.
   Beebe died Monday at the Miami Heart Institute.
   The Herald became a recognized chronicler of Latin America while
Beebe served as managing editor. Some of the reporters he hired
became Pulitzer Prize winners and Knight-Ridder executives.
   Beebe joined the Herald as a copy editor in 1944, served as
managing editor in 1951-1966, then was senior managing editor until
1972, when he became an associate publisher and continued
contributing travel articles.
   Beebe helped found the World Press Freedom Committee in 1976 and
served as its executive director and chairman of the
anti-censorship alliance of 32 journalistic organizations. He also
served as president of the Inter American Press Association.
   ``George Beebe ran the news department the way he lived his life
_ a caring, compassionate person who believed in letting the reader
feel he was important,'' said Lee Hills, managing editor when Beebe
arrived at the Herald and retired chairman of its parent
Knight-Ridder group.
   The Pittsfield, Mass., native was managing editor of the Boston
University News for 13 years before joining the Herald.
   Beebe prepared his own obituary for the newspaper, writing: ``If
I have been successful, it is because I have had Helen at my side.
She has been a patient, understanding and devoted newspaper wife.''
   He is survived by his wife, three nieces and four nephews.
   A memorial service is planned Thursday at the First United
Methodist Church of Coral Gables.

<HEAD>Israeli Settlers Quit Christian Quarter of Old Jerusalem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armed settlers left a compound in the Christian
Quarter of Jerusalem's Old City before a court deadline Tuesday,
and a judge sentenced the settlement movement's founder to five
months in jail for killing a Palestinian.
   Jerusalem District Court Judge Shalom Brenner also handed Rabbi
Moshe Levinger a seven-month suspended sentence for fatally
shooting shoestore owner Kayed Hassan Salah on Sept. 30, 1988.
   Levinger was initially charged with manslaughter, which carries
a maximum term of 20 years in prison. As part of a plea bargain, he
said he was guilty to the lesser charge of causing death by
negligence.
   Salah, 42, was standing at the entrance to his shop when he was
shot during a stone-throwing incident in the West Bank town of
Hebron.
   Israeli human rights advocates say settlers have killed at least
29 Palestinians since the start of the uprising nearly 29 months
ago. Only one other settler besides Levinger has been sentenced to
jail since the insurrection began in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   In Jerusalem's Old City, settler spokesmen said 50 Jewish
families had complied with a Supreme Court order to vacate the
72-room St. John's Hospice, which is owned by the Greek Orthodox
Church.
   ``I believe they will be back. I believe in justice,'' settler
spokesman Shmuel Eviatar said, as bells from the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher and other nearby churches pealed loudly.
   Greek Orthdox Bishop Areopulos Christodulos pledged to
``continue in all the courts until all the settlers get out of the
building.''
   After heated arguments between the settlers and clergymen in
black cloaks, a six-member church delegation was allowed to inspect
the complex to confirm that all settlers who were supposed to leave
had done so.
   ``They evacuated the settlement, except for 20 people,'' said
Avraham Sochovolsky, an attorney for the church.
   Reporters and photographers saw settlers leave the building in
small groups over the past few days, apparently to avoid a mass
exit that would look like a retreat.
   The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that all but 20 of the 150
settlers who moved into St. John's Hospice on April 11 should leave
by noon Tuesday.
   The remaining settlers act as caretakers for the Panama-based
SBC company, which acquired the lease that the church contends is
invalid. The court let them stay until the tenancy dispute is
decided.
   The caretakers were later seen in the windows, which were draped
with the blue-and-white Israeli flags. They also unfurled one flag
over the street.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek and senior police officials have
warned that the settlers' presence threatened to provoke violence
in the Old City, which is divided into jealously guarded Christian,
Moslem, Jewish and Armenian quarters.
   The Old City was captured from Jordan in 1967 and annexed by
Israel. Most nations, including the United States, do not recognize
Israel's claim to sovereignty.
   Major Christian sects joined in an unprecedented closing of holy
sites throughout Israel on Friday to protest the settlement.
   The move into the Old City was seen part of a broader campaign
by right-wingers to exploit Israel's present political vacuum and
push new settlement activity.

   The airline industry boosted a government
program to fight aviation terrorism Tuesday, increasing rewards for
information that helps stop airliner sabotage to $3 million.
   The Air Transport Association, representing U.S. carriers,
announced it would match any government reward up to $1 million if
it involves a threat or attack against a U.S. airline.
   Morris D. Busby, State Department ambassador for
counter-terrorism, said rewards already have been paid in the
government's $2 million program, but he said details of the
payments would not be disclosed.
   Anyone who provides information that leads to the arrest,
conviction or thwarting of an aviation terrorist could get up to $3
million, officials said in a joint news conference with
representatives of ATA, State Department, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the FBI.
   The reward program also includes an offer of relocation and
other protection for witnesses, officials said.
   ``This should be a powerful incentive for people within, or
close to, terrorist organizations to reveal plots before they are
hatched,'' said Robert J. Aaronson, ATA president.
   He said it would also apply to past acts, including information
about the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
   Aaronson said U.S. airlines would each contribute a share of the
reward that would be tied to the State Department reward program,
which was increased by Congress last year from $500,000 to $2
million. The ATA's $1 million also would be available through the
FBI to match rewards designed to combat domestic air terrorism,
Aaronson said.
   James B. Busey, FAA administrator, said the increased rewards
send a strong message to terrorists that ``the United States and
the aviation community are fully committed to this battle against
terrorism.''
   Bruce Smith, a Pan American pilot whose wife, Ingrid, died in
the Flight 103 bombing, had proposed the rewards.
   Smith said at the news conference more has to be done to stop
state-sponsored terrorism and to get other countries to cooperate
in anti-terrorist efforts.
   William Baker, FBI assistant director, said the bureau's
investigators are meeting every day with foreign authorities in an
effort to ``keep the pressure on'' to solve the Lockerbie bombing.
   There have been no arrests or charges in the incident, but
authorities have said they believe Middle East terrorists planted
the plastic explosives inside a radio cassette player that became
part of checked-in luggage.

   Rain has improved the winter wheat outlook in
the northern Great Plains and Pacific Northwest but more is needed,
the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   Soil moisture was said to be ``adequate or adequate to surplus''
in the central and southern plains, while in Arkansas, Missouri and
parts of Texas rain continued to slow field work.
   Overall, the 1990 winter wheat crop was said to be in ``mostly
good to fair'' condition during the week of April 23-29, with an
estimated 15 percent of the crop headed, which was average for this
time of the season.
   ``Winter wheat was mostly good in Colorado and Montana, good to
fair in Nebraska, and fair to good in South Dakota,'' the report
said.
   The crop was reported ``good to excellent'' in Kansas, good in
Oklahoma, and ``fair to good'' in Texas.
   Planting of spring wheat was reported 54 percent completed, 9
percentage points ahead of normal.
   Corn planting was said to be 21 percent complete, five points
behind the average for this time of year. Planting was under way in
all of the major corn states.

   U.S. savings bonds will earn interest at a
rate of 7.01 percent from May 1 through Oct. 31, up slightly from
6.98 percent the during the previous six months, the Treasury
Department said Tuesday.
   Catalina V. Villalpando, treasurer of the United States, said
the new rate ``will keep savings bonds in the competitive range
with other market-sensitive instruments during the coming months.''
   Savings bond interest rates are changed each May 1 and Nov. 1 to
reflect open market rates. They are based on 85 percent of the
yield on five-year Treasury securities, which have averaged 8.25
percent.
   Savings bond yields at redemption are the average of semiannual
market-based rates during the time held, compounded semiannually or
at a minimum rate, whichever is greater. The current minimum rate
is 6 percent.

captured in south Lebanon or the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
It offered a deal Tuesday to free many of them in exchange for
three Israeli captives. Here at a glance is a breakdown on the Arab
and Israeli captives:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HELD BY ISRAEL _ More than 5,300 Arab prisoners, including more
than 5,000 Palestinians detained by Israeli during the uprising
against military rule that began nearly 29 months ago in the
occupied territories.
   About 1,300 of the Palestinians are under so-called
administrative detention or jailed without trial in a tent prison
camp in southern Israel.
   Sheikh Abdul-Karim Obeid, 33, a Shiite Moslem cleric of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrilla group, is the most prominent
prisoner. Israelis kidnapped him and two aides in Jibchit, south
Lebanon, on July 28. They are believed held in Israel.

<TEXT>
   HELD BY THE ISRAELI-BACKED SOUTH LEBANON ARMY MILITIA _ More
than 300 Lebanese detainees, most of them Shiites, held at a
compound in Al-Khiam, just north of Israel's border with Lebanon.
   Jawad Kaswi, in captivity since 1988, is the best known. Kaswi
is a onetime leader of a faction of the Amal Shiite militia group,
which once had control of one of the Israeli prisoners.

<TEXT>
   HELD BY THE ARABS _ An Israeli air navigator and two Israeli
infantrymen have been held since 1986. All three are believed held
by Shiites linked to Hezbollah.
   Navigator Ron Arad was shot down during a bombing mission over
Sidon, south Lebanon, in October 1986.
   Soldiers Yossi Fink and Rahamim Alsheikh of the Givati Infantry
Brigade were captured in an ambush in south Lebanon in February
1986.

   Convicted Colombian drug kingpin
Carlos Lehder Rivas has written Manuel Noriega urging the deposed
Panamanian leader to plead guilty to drug charges, but pledging not
to testify against him.
   ``Your lawyers are telling you stories to get your money. You
would be wise to talk to your old friends and formalize a
declaration of guilt, showing dignity and a sense of reality,'' the
letter said.
   Lehder, 40, who prosecutors said worked with Colombia's Medellin
drug cartel, was convicted of smuggling cocaine and is serving a
life term plus 135 years at Marion Federal Prison in Illinois.
   Noriega, 51, is confined in the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center near Miami, facing drug charges which include
accepting $4.6 million in bribes from the cartel.
   Lehder sent The Associated Press a copy of his letter to
Noriega, dated April 18. The Spanish language letter, received
Tuesday, bears his recognizable signature and a fingerprint, and
the envelope bears a Marion, Ill., postmark and a prison stamp. An
accompanying letter authorized release of the Noriega letter.
   However, Noriega might never see the letter. Mel Collins, an
assistant warden at MCC, said that without authorization one
federal prisoner may not write to another, and any such letter
would be rejected at that prison.
   Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Miami, said prosecutors had nothing to say about the letter. ``It's
personal correspondence from one person to another and we would
have no comment,'' she said.
   Frank Rubino, Noriega's lead defense attorney, was in trial and
not immediately available for comment, his receptionist said.
   The letter chastises Noriega for his one-time cooperation with
the Drug Enforcement Administration. On several occasions, Noriega
deported drug suspects to the United States, even though not
required to under Panamanian law.
   ``It is a sign of greatness for a man to recognize his errors _
the sorrow of the men of your race whom you turned over to agents
of the DEA, destined for the awaiting prisons of the U.S.A.,''
Lehder said.
   Despite the criticism, Lehder said he will not help Noriega's
prosecutors.
   ``I will not testify against you because, despite your sins, we
are of the same fraternal Latin race,'' the letter said.
   Lehder also cites federal penal codes to show Noriega he has no
chance of escaping justice, saying the U.S. force that invaded
Panama on Dec. 20 had the right to capture and prosecute him.
   ``You were arrested, not kidnapped as I was,'' wrote Lehder, who
was seized by Colombian troops in February 1987 and immediately
flown to Jacksonville to face drug-smuggling charges. Following a
7{-month-long trial, Lehder was convicted on all counts.

<HEAD>Prisons Setting Up Anti-Drug Programs For Soon To Be Freed Inmates</HEAD>

   Education programs to discourage federal
inmates from resuming drug habits after their release are being set
up at eight federal prisons, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
   As many as 975 inmates at eight federal prison facilities will
participate in the two programs that will also provide post-release
supervision, said Michael Quinlan, director of the Bureau of
Prisons.
   ``The only effective drug treatment is treatment that is offered
toward the end of the sentence and is tied into the community
integration process,'' Quinlan told reporters.
   The approach is being taken because prison officials decided
``we have a unique captive audience and we ought to take advantage
of it'' Quinlan said.
   Additionally, all new federal prison inmates who have a history
of drug abuse will be required to complete a drug education
program, Quinlan said.
   New inmates who refuse to participate in this program will be
denied privileges extended to other prisoners and will be eligible
for only the lowest-paying jobs in work programs, Quinlan said.
   The number of federal inmates with a history of drug use has
grown dramatically in the last decade, Quinlan said. Currently, 45
percent of the 56,200 federal inmates had drug abuse problems when
they were sentenced to prison, he said.
   In all, the Bureau of Prisons expects to spend $6 million on
drug-prevention programs during the current fiscal year, up from
$2.25 million last year, Quinlan said.
   The new programs were announced at a press briefing a day before
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee was scheduled to
question Justice Department officials about a cutoff of $5 million
in drug-treatment funds to state and local prison systems.
   The money, which was available last year in grants to state and
local officials, was shifted to other programs during the current
fiscal year.
   Clifford J. White III, deputy assistant attorney general in the
Office of Justice Programs and Gerald Regier, acting director of
the Bureau fo Justice Assistance, were scheduled to be questioned
on Wednesday.
   The new programs for federal prison inmates completing their
sentences are based on the notion that ``a person is addicted to
drugs regardless of whether the sentence may interrupt the ability
to get that substance,'' Quinlan said.
   ``If people do not learn to deal with that addiction, they are
going to return to the same life style,'' Quinlan said.
   Intensive 1,000-hour drug-education programs have already been
set up at federal facilities in Butner, N.C. and Lexington, Ky. An
identical program is also planned for the federal prison in
Tallahassee, Fla., Quinlan said.
   A total of 350 inmates in the last 15 to 24 months of their
sentences will participate in the programs, he said.
   In September, 500-hour education programs will be offfered at
prisons in Sheridan, Ore.; Seagoville, Texas; Rochester, Minn.;
Oxford, Wis.; and Fairton, N.J.
   The programs at each of those facilities will serve 100 to 125
inmates each year with counseling and individual therapy.

<HEAD>Bush Asks Key Members of Congress to Back Space Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush asked key members of Congress
to support his $15.8-billion space exploration package Tuesday, but
was told the money will be difficult to come by in the current
fiscal squeeze.
   Leaders of the committees that deal most directly with the space
budget were supportive of Bush's plans to develop the Space Station
and send missions to the moon and Mars, but were less positive
about prospects for the money to finance such missions,
participants said.
   One said Bush was told, ``We can't make you any promises.''
   ``We have got to find a way to finance space,'' Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., told reporters after the meeting. ``You're going to
have to have some identifiable, sustainable source of revenue. ...
People are strongly supportive of space, but next year and the year
after they might not be.''
   Heflin said that space exploration should not have to compete,
as it does now, for funds that also are sought for environmental,
housing and veterans programs.
   Heflin mentioned user fees as one way to raise money for an
expanded space program. Participants said Bush was noncommittal
about that idea.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater characterized the
suggestions as a way ``to provide long-term, continuous support for
the space program as opposed to the annual appropriations process.''
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. and chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee covering space exploration, called on Bush to ``go
beyond bumper stickers and big promises'' to support the space
initiative.
   She said congressional leaders want to meet with Bush's key
budget personnel to look for ``a sustainable revenue source'' that
would keep the space program from having to compete in the budget
battle every year.
   ``In a budget that is funded year to year, it's very hard to
allocate those resources that are for Mission To Planet Earth, the
Space Station and then a Moon-Mars initiative, which could take 30
years of funding,'' she said.
   Bush called the meeting, the first such presidential gathering
of all the congressional leaders on financing the space program.
Congress next month begins the process of writing the fiscal 1991
federal budget.
   Bush made a pitch for support of his proposal to increase this
fiscal year's financing for space activities by $2.9 billion to
$15.8 billion.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, the chairman of the president's Space
Council, spoke with the congressional delegation about Bush's
proposal to return Americans to the moon and then send a manned
mission to Mars.
   Separately, Quayle said in a speech in Arlington, Va., that
savings from lowered defense spending should go for space-related
research.
   ``Investing in space is especially important in light of the
decline in our military spending,'' he told the American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

   A drought-fed brush fire was contained Tuesday
after it blackened 5,500 acres of Everglades grassland, a park
spokeswoman said.
   ``It looks good,'' said Pat Tolle of Everglades National Park.
``It's been confined to a few isolated areas, and there are no
active flames.''
   Afternoon winds were light, aiding forestry officials' efforts
to dump water from helicopters on the hot spots. Firefighters also
were building firebreaks around the burned area.
   Most of the acreage burned outside the park in south Dade
County, but about 1,600 acres of parkland were blackened by the
lightning-sparked blaze, she said.
   ``Periodic fire is critical to maintain the marsh habitat,'' she
said. ``Without periodic fire, the hardwood trees encroach and it
no longer functions as a wading bird habitat.''
   But this fire alarmed park officials because a two-year drought
has left vast stretches of the wetlands almost bone dry.
   ``Conditions are so extreme, we want to confine it,'' she said.
``If it gets into the pinelands, a fire would be very damaging
because it's so dry.''
   Drought conditions have left the Everglades so dry that
alligators and wading birds are traveling far from their natural
habitats to find water.
   Most residents in central and south Florida face restrictions on
lawn watering and home car washing, and water levels in Lake
Okeechobee, which supplies much of the region's water, have hit
record lows.

   More than 18,000 acres of lush marshes and
thick forests _ rich in wildlife and all within the city limits _
were dedicated as a national wildlife refuge Tuesday by Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan.
   ``We have some other wildlife on Bourbon Street, but this is the
wildlife we want to protect,'' joked Mayor Sidney Barthelemy in
ceremonies marking creation of the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife
Refuge.
   Bayou Sauvage will be a premier education center for wildlife
preservation, Lujan said. The sprawling site is a haven for
alligators, nutria, otters, rabbits and many varieties of fish and
migratory birds.
   And, Lujan added, it will make unspoiled wetlands and forests
accessible to city dwellers and New Orleans tourists.
   ``The refuge is right in the middle of New Orleans, only nine
miles from Jackson Square'' said Lujan, referring to a popular
French Quarter landmark.
   The refuge is near the site of a proposed eastern New Orleans
landfill that is drawing strong opposition from residents of the
area. State Sen. Ben Bagert of New Orleans, , Gov. Buddy Roemer's
representative at the ceremony, asked approximately 100 dignitaries
attending to support his bill in the Legislature that would
prohibit landfills within a mile of wildlife refuges.
   Lujan said later it was the first time he'd heard about plans
for a landfill. ``I can tell you that we're not sympathetic at all
about having a refuge next to a landfill,'' Lujan said.
   It was purchased from South Point Inc., a subsidiary of the
Merrill Lynch investment firm, for $7.75 million.
   Estimates of the cost of developing the refuge run as high as
$19 million. It would include an administrative building, visitor
center and environmental education complex, and officials hope to
finish it in two to three years.
   Legislation creating the refuge was introduced in 1986 by Reps.
Lindy Boggs, D-La., and John Breaux, D-La., today Louisiana's
junior senator.

   Three psychics and a $50,000 reward didn't work.
In the end, it was a veterinarian walking her dog who found the
bones of a Harvard student who vanished in 1981.
   The discovery of the remains of Joan Webster also renewed
questions about the role of the infamous Leonard ``The Quahog''
Paradiso, a small-time hood doing time for another slaying.
   Paradiso never was charged in the Webster case, in which Essex
County District Attorney Kevin Burke said he ``became a suspect
almost immediately'' after Webster disappeared from Logan
International Airport.
   The case was revived after veterinarian Karen Wolf last month
stumbled across part of a skull in the woods in Hamilton, a wealthy
community 25 miles north of Boston.
   More bones were found after that.
   Confirmation that the remains were Webster's was made Monday.
Authorities said the cause of death was ``blunt trauma to the
head,'' and that Webster was a homicide victim.
   ``That is some measure of relief,'' George Webster said of the
identification. He said he and his wife, Terry, had long believed
their daughter had been slain.
   Joan Webster was last seen at the airport on Nov. 28, 1981. The
native of Glen Ridge, N.J., and Syracuse University graduate was
headed back to the Harvard's School of Design after a Thanksgiving
visit with her parents.
   Webster was a successful and active student who had made the
dean's list at Syracuse. She liked skiing, sailing, tennis and
photography and had traveled widely, her parents said.
   The search for Webster turned up her wallet 300 feet from where
20-year-old Marie Ianuzzi's body was dumped in 1979 in Saugus.
Saugus is 15 miles from where the bones were found. Paradiso was
convicted of Ianuzzi's murder in 1984.
   After Webster vanished, her family and friends offered a $50,000
reward. Shortly after the disappearance, three psychics came
forward, including one who said he envisioned her body was in a
pond in Manchester, about five miles from where her bones were
later found.
   ``It was close,'' said Beverly Police Capt. Gordon Richards, who
was among the investigators in 1982.
   In 1985, attention focused on Paradiso after a former cellmate
alleged that the one-time fish merchant claimed involvement in
killing Webster.
   Timothy Burke, who was Suffolk County prosecutor at the time,
said in an affidavit that Paradiso told an informant he forced
Webster onto his 26-foot cabin cruiser, the Malafemmina _ Italian
for ``bad woman'' _ with a fake .357-caliber Magnum.
   According to the account, he hit her on the head with a whiskey
bottle and dumped her body in Boston Harbor.
   Many people now want to talk to Paradiso, 45, formerly from
Revere.
   Paradiso, who has defended himself in the media in the past, is
not talking much. He did not return a phone call Tuesday, and a
spokesman for the Department of Correction said the Walpole inmate
refuses to speak to reporters.
   It could not be immediately determined if he was currently being
represented by an attorney. His convictions include rape and
attempted murder of a hitchhiker in 1975, as well as the
strangulation of Ianuzzi in 1979.
   He was also found guilty on federal bankruptcy fraud charges for
claiming to be worth $10 when he was working at a lobster company
and had $10,000 in the bank.
   When the prison informant linked him to Webster's disappearance,
Paradiso denied the allegations. He protested his innocence in
writing to newspapers, the district attorney, police and even
Webster's parents.
   ``Now do you think a high-class smart girl like Joan Webster
from a good family, with money, is going to get into a car with a
guy like me smelling of fish?'' he told a newspaper six years ago.
   He sued Boston magazine for $3 million, saying he was libeled in
a story linking him to the Webster case. That suit was dismissed in
1987 by a judge who said Paradiso's reputation was so bad he was
``libel-proof.''
   Kevin Burke, the Essex County prosecutor, indicated Paradiso
wasn't ruled out even though finding the bones in the woods seems
to discount the Boston Harbor theory.
   Shards of metal and glass stuck in Paradiso's index finger,
thought to be part of the fake gun, became the subject of a
protracted and much publicized legal battle over the inmate's right
to keep the contents of his injured finger secret. He underwent
forced surgery but it yielded no new evidence.

   A 4-year-old boy is facing a tricky
procedure of using umbilical cord blood from the birth of his
sister on Tuesday to help treat his rare form of leukemia, doctors
said.
   Michael Sancilio's form of leukemia afflicts less than 1 percent
of childhood leukemia victims. ``Children with this disease
generally survive less than a year after diagnosis,'' said Stephen
Rodgers, the family's pediatrician. Michael was diagnosed with
chronic myelogenous leukemia in mid-March.
   Normal treatment is a bone marrow transplant, Rodgers said, but
the chance of quickly finding a bone marrow match from a donor is
statistically slim. With so little time, doctors are gambling on
the umbilical blood transfusion.
   That's where Christina Grace Sancilio comes in. She was born by
Caesarian section Tuesday morning at Virginia Beach General
Hospital. Dr. Leslie L. Wasserman, who delivered both Christina and
Michael, said the newborn is healthy and doing well.
   Using a syringe, Wasserman made two collections of umbilical
blood _ one with the placenta still attached, the other with the
placenta delivered. The one cup of blood is en route to Indiana
University scientists who will check to see if Christina's blood
matches Michael's.
   Wasserman said the procedure was difficult because the surgery
team had to ensure that none of the mother's blood contaminated the
umbilical cord blood. Wasserman said a Caesarian section was
performed because of 33-year-old Denise Sancilio's difficulties in
delivering Michael.
   Physicians put the chances for a match at 1-in-4, far better
than the 1-in-20,000 chance of a match in the general population.
Rodgers said this was the first time the experimental procedure
would be tried for a leukemia patient.
   Umbilical blood contains special cells called stem cells, which
develop bone marrow in babies in their first nine months. Rodgers
said Christina already has the necessary stem cells to develop bone
marrow.
   If the blood matches Michael's, the cells will be grown in a
laboratory at the university, which pioneered the procedure for the
treatment of some forms of anemia. Once scientists have grown the
cells, they will be transfused into Michael after all his diseased
bone marrow has been killed by radiation.
   The cells are injected into the patient's heart and act as if
they were in a newborn, heading straight for the bone to produce
bone marrow.
   `We don't know what all the problems might be at this point,''
said Rodgers. ``It's all going to take several months, and Michael
will be close to the end of his disease when we try the
transfusion.''
   Even if the procedure is successful, Rodgers said the child
faces a lifetime of treatment to ensure the body does not reject
the new bone marrow.
   With sons Michael and Tony in his arms, Anthony Sancilio, 35,
tried to express his joy and hope at seeing his daughter. ``I'm
speechless ... I'm thankful the baby is healthy and hopeful that we
will have a match,'' he said.
   Tests of 7-year-old Tony showed he was not a compatible donor
for his brother.

<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with home port legislation, detail</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised the ante
in the Pentagon budget battle Tuesday by extending a worldwide
freeze on military construction and ordering 207 projects _
including Navy ports in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and New York _
be reviewed for possible cancellation.
   ``There's serious doubt about whether or not we will get the
levels of funding from Congress that will allow us to go forward
with these programs,'' Cheney said.
   The move is expected to fuel the debate between those in
Congress who want to squeeze Pentagon spending and lawmakers who
want to protect local jobs.
   Cheney said the freeze order, which he imposed in January and
now will last until June 15, affects more than $7 billion in new
contracts. The 207 construction projects to be reviewed are valued
at $1.2 billion, he said.
   At a news conference, Cheney accused some members of Congress of
``a certain amount of hypocrisy'' because they publicly advocate
smaller Pentagon budgets even as they lobby him in private to
protect home-state military programs.
   ``Some of these actions may not be popular with members of
Congress who want to cut the defense budget even as they plead to
save the projects in their own states and districts,'' Cheney said.
   ``But when tight budgets force dedicated soldiers to turn in
their uniforms and leave the service, I cannot put construction
projects ahead of people.''
   The 207 sites under study include strategic home ports in
Ingleside, Texas; Mobile, Ala.; Pascagoula, Miss.; and Staten
Island, N.Y.
   The majority of the projects under review are overseas, many in
West Germany. Planned improvements or construction of hangars,
maintenance facilities, family housing projects, schools for
military dependents and medical units are among the items targeted.
   But several of the domestic sites targeted for study carry
big-money pricetags.
   The statement said that besides the four ports, the review will
also include a $110 million project at a rocket test facility at
Arnold, Tenn.; $60 million in improvements at Fort Hood and Red
River Army Depot in Texas; and a $37 million project at a
consolidated maintenance facility at Tooele, Utah.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on military installations and facilities,
said she was pleased with Cheney's announcement because he targeted
overseas work she has opposed.
   In recent weeks, Cheney has taken steps to pare the defense
budget, including cutting from 132 to 75 the number of B-2 Stealth
bombers it proposes buying and sharply reducing other warplane
programs.
   Citing changes in the world situation and increasing budget
limitations, Cheney said ``significant opportunities exist'' to
reduce the cost and size of the DOD's infrastructure.
   Cheney's order directs that no new construction contracts be
awarded for projects financed under the military construction
budget approved by Congress.
   The 207 construction projects will be ``candidates for
rescission,'' which means Cheney may recommend that Congress revoke
the funding approved for earlier projects.
   A DOD statement said Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood will
review construction plans for possible cancellation and submit a
proposed list of rescissions to Cheney by June 1.
   Cheney said that if those lawmakers who are advocating slashing
$20 billion from President Bush's $306.9 billion request for budget
authority get their way, more than 207 projects would have to be
canceled.
   Cheney said he took the action because the freeze ran out Monday
night, not because the House had scheduled a vote on a Budget
Committee proposal to reduce Bush's defense budget request.
   On Capitol Hill, Schroeder and Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla.,
introduced legislation that would close the home port on Staten
Island and freeze funds for construction at five other home ports
in Everett, Wash.; Ingleside, Texas; Pascagoula, Miss.; Mobile,
Ala.; and Pensacola, Fla.
   The ports in Everett and Pensacola weren't included in Cheney's
review because they are nearly completed, Pentagon officials said.
   The GAO, in testimony last month before the House Armed Services
subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical materials that
Bennett chairs, recommended freezing spending on new home ports
until the Navy decides what it needs.
   At the hearing, New York Mayor David Dinkins said his city does
not want the home port and cannot afford it. Eleven of the
14-member New York City congressional delegation and 16 members of
the New York City Council also opposed the project.

<TEXT>
   President Bush gave Congress the final report
Tuesday on the now-lifted U.S. sanctions against Nicaragua,
calculating down to the last penny how much it cost to wage
economic war against Managua's former leftist government.
   Bush said it cost taxpayers exactly $1,309,783.48 for salaries
for personnel at the Departments of State and Treasury and the
National Security Council who administered a state of national
emergency against Nicaragua from May 1, 1985 through March 13, 1990.
   The national emergency was declared by then-President Ronald
Reagan, who imposed tough economic sanctions against Nicaragua,
including a ban on all U.S. imports to Managua and exports from
there.
   The action helped cripple the country's economy and spawn
dissatisfaction with the regime of Daniel Ortega.
   Bush removed the sanctions and lifted the declaration of
national emergency on March 13 following the upset victory of
U.S.-backed candidate Violeta Chamorro in presidential balloting.
   Bush said her election ``ended the unusual and extraordinary
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United
States previously posed by the policies and actions of the
Sandinista government'' headed by Ortega.

<HEAD>Court Gives State Reprieve in School Finance Overhaul</HEAD>

   A state judge on Tuesday gave Texas until
June to enact a plan to overhaul the financing of its poorer
schools _ or have a plan written for it.
   The 30-day reprieve by District Judge Scott McCown freed $500
million in state aid to schools in May and guarantees schools will
stay open through the school year. But McCown said time is running
out.
   He said the state must help the property-poor school districts
that challenged the current $13.5 billion a year system as unfair
and won a 9-0 ruling from the Texas Supreme Court.
   ``The present scheme of public school finance is a great wrong.
... The poor have waited for too long,'' McCown said as he extended
the state Supreme Court's May 1 deadline for action until June 1.
   State Education Commissioner William Kirby said the ruling gives
the Legislature and the governor ``one last opportunity to get
together'' and come up with a plan.
   Kirby said he feared another legislative failure would lead to a
court-written plan.
   ``I don't think the court has the ability to put additional
revenue into the system,'' Kirby said. ``There's no question that
we're looking at Robin Hood _ you're really talking about taking
from the rich, giving to the poor.''
   Lawmakers and Gov. Bill Clements failed in the second attempt to
overhaul the current system. The lawmakers proposed a half-cent
sales tax increase to finance the overhaul; and Clements plans to
veto it.
   The Legislature's second, 30-day special session on education
ended Tuesday. Clements immediately called another session to
convene Wednesday afternoon.
   The Democratic-controlled Legislature approved a $555 million
reform plan. To pay for it, they proposed $114 million in budget
cuts and raising the state sales tax from 6 cents to 6{ cents on
the dollar.
   Clements, a Republican, said money should be taken from other
state programs to fund school finance reform.
   Since the state failed to enact a new school system, McCown
could have stopped state payments to schools on Tuesday. Instead,
he extended the deadline.
   Should Clements and lawmakers fail a third time, McCown also
issued a complex set of instructions that guarantee that a new
system of school finance is operating by Sept. 1. Those
instructions included:
   _ Appointment by the judge of a special master who will begin
work this month on a finance plan of his own.
   _ A requirement that the judge approve any state spending for
schools after June 1 if no reform plan has been approved by
Clements and the Legislature.
   _ A June 25 judicial review of either the state's plan or the
special master's plan.
   After McCown's ruling, Clements said he was more confident than
ever that budget cuts, not a tax increase, will be used to pay for
the plan.
   ``I think the legislators have a different view of the situation
than they did before, because they know they can't override my
veto,'' Clements said.
   But some lawmakers sharply criticized the governor, who is
retiring. Sen. Carl Parker said Clements was passing the buck so he
can leave office at the end of the year without approving a tax
increase.
   ``It passes the real buck, the out-of-pocket buck, to the local
taxpayer. Because what we don't spend at the state level right now
will come out of the hides of the homeowners and small business
owners,'' said Parker, chairman of the Senate Education Committee.
   Texas, with 1,100 school districts, is one of a dozen states
where courts have overturned school finance systems deemed unfair
to poor districts. The others are Kentucky, New Jersey, Kansas,
Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia,
Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.

   Tens of thousands of people rallied
nationwide Tuesday to demand the removal of U.S. military bases,
and more than 30 people were injured and scores arrested in clashes
with police.
   The protests, organized by the leftist May First Movement, were
the most extensive against the U.S. bases since President Corazon
Aquino took power in a popular uprising that ousted President
Ferdinand Marcos in 1985.
   The largest gathering was near the U.S. Embassy in Manila and
attracted 50,000 protesters.
   ``There will be no peace and democracy in the country as long as
the U.S. bases are here,'' Crispin Beltran, the movement's
chairman, told the cheering crowd.
   After the rally, police blocked about 4,000 protesters who tried
to march on the embassy to serve a ``notice of termination'' for
the bases.
   Manila Mayor Mel Lopez defused the situation by persuading
protest leaders to allow him to deliver the eviction notice. Two
people were arrested before Lopez intervened.
   Opposition to the bases has been growing because many Filipinos
view them as an infringement on national sovereignty. Mrs. Aquino
says she has not yet decided whether to support extending the lease
after it expires in September 1991.
   U.S. and Filipino negotiators will begin talks May 14 on
extending the lease on the bases.
   In Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila, Filipino troops charged
into a crowd of nearly 5,000 protesters who tried to enter the gate
at Clark Air Base to deliver a termination notice.
   Protesters hurled stones at the troops who charged with
truncheons. Witnesses said troops beat dozens of reporters,
protesters and bystanders and at least 10 people were hospitalized
for injuries.
   In Tacloban, 360 miles southeast of Manila, police fired water
cannons at about 1,000 workers, students and other protesters.
   Police said 20 protesters and one policeman were injured and
eight people arrested.
   In Cebu, 350 miles southeast of Manila, about 2,000 militants
marched on the U.S. Consulate, where they burned and stomped on an
American flag after hurling tomatoes at it.
   In Iloilo, 290 miles south of the capital, about 800 militant
workers marched, denouncing Mrs. Aquino as a ``puppet of the
Americans'' and demanding her resignation. Five people were
arrested in the demonstration.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Official Shows No Interest In `Food Truce'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Ethiopia's relief agency showed no
interest in a military truce that would allow food supplies to
reach starving people in his country, according to a congressman
who met with him Tuesday.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of a congressional hunger
committee, said he was disappointed by his meeting with Yilima
Kassaye, head of Ethiopia's relief and rehabilitation committee.
   ``I got the impression they care very little about their own
people,'' Hall said in an interview. ``It was not a good report.
... Clearly they put military victory above saving the lives of
people.''
   Kassaye told Hall the Soviet-backed Ethiopian government
initiated air raids on the port of Massawa, where food supplies
have been blocked after rebels captured the city on Feb. 11.
   The rebel Eritrean People's Liberation Front has been fighting
for independence from Ethiopia for 29 eyars.
   A series of seemingly random attacks on Massawa by the Ethiopian
air force began April 4.
   Hall said he proposed to Kassaye that there be a ``food truce''
for three weeks so relief agencies to bring food to starving people
in the north.
   Kassaye responded, in essence, that there was ``no wiggle room
to get food through the port.''
   ``It was not a good report,'' Hall said.

Killings</HEAD>

   A judge Tuesday rejected John E. List's
plea for forgiveness, and ordered the former Sunday school teacher
imprisoned for life, saying the voices of his slaughtered family
were demanding justice.
   ``For what he did to his wife, his mother, his daughter, his two
sons and for how he traumatized an entire community, (the)
defendant should have no hope of breathing the free air that graces
the lives of law abiding citizens,'' said Superior Court Judge
William Wertheimer.
   The judge sentenced List, 64, to the maximum five consecutive
life sentences.
   List was convicted April 12 of murdering his wife, Helen, 46;
mother Alma, 84; daughter, Patricia, 16; and sons John, 15, and
Frederick, 13, in 1971 in their 18-room mansion in Westfield, 25
miles from New York City.
   ``John Emil List is without remorse and without honor,''
Wertheimer said. ``After 18 years, 5 months and 22 days, it is now
time for the voices of Helen, Alma, Patricia, Frederick and John F.
List to rise from the grave, for it is the criminal justice system,
through its trial courts, that speaks for all victims of crime.''
   As the judge left, spectators who packed the courtroom broke
into applause.
   List, who eluded authorities for 18 years before a television
show led to his capture in Virginia in June, must serve 14 years
and 11 months of each life sentence. There was no death penalty in
New Jersey at the time of the killings.
   ``I wish to inform the court I remain truly sorry for the tragic
events of 1971,'' List said in his first public statement on the
slayings. ``I feel that because of my mental state at the time, I
was unaccountable for what happened. I ask all affected by this for
their forgiveness, understanding and prayer.''
   Prosecutor Eleanor Clark mocked List's plea for mercy, saying he
showed none to his family and did not deserve to see the light of
day.
   ``The state of New Jersey and the citizens of Union County want
to say to John E. List that just because you had financial
problems, just because your wife was ill and just because your
children were adolescents, we do not understand and will not
understand what you did,'' she said.
   Wertheimer agreed, noting that experts in the trial said List
still suffers from a compulsive-obsessive personality and might
repeat his crimes if he ever returned to the community.
   Public defender Elijah Miller had argued for concurrent life
sentences, saying the murders were a one-time act by a troubled
man. He said he would appeal the sentence and conviction.
   Miller said List was mentally deficient at the time, a product
of a strict Lutheran upbringing with the ``values and ethics of the
19th century.''
   Because of the former accountant's attention to detail, the
bodies remained in the home for almost a full month before they
were discovered _ from Nov. 9, 1971, until Dec. 7.
   Witnesses testified List had written notes excusing the children
from school and had the newspaper stopped. He turned down the
thermostat to slow decomposition of the bodies, paid all his bills,
cashed all his checks and left a note for the milkman telling him
he wouldn't be needed for a while.
   Then he shot his wife over breakfast, his mother in her bed when
she asked what the noise was, and then each child as they came home
from school.
   He left a note for his pastor and fled, taking on the alias
Robert P. Clark, an accountant first in metropolitan Denver and
then near Richmond, Va.
   He remarried and again became active in his church. His second
wife, Delores Clark, has remained out of the public spotlight since
his arrest.
   List was arrested on a tip generated after the television
anti-crime show, ``America's Most Wanted,'' re-enacted the slayings.

<HEAD>Senate OKs Aid for Nicaragua, Panama</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After a week of delays, the Senate on Tuesday
approved a $3.4 billion ``emergency'' spending bill that includes
$720 million in aid President Bush wants to help the new
democracies in Panama and Nicaragua.
   The action, on a voice vote, sent the spending package to a
conference to work out differences with a $2.4 billion House-passed
version.
   Bush has threatened to veto the measure if negotiators leave
intact a Senate provision that would allow the District of Columbia
to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women.
   Most of the new foreign aid would be offset by cuts in this
year's Pentagon budget, representing the first major application of
a ``peace dividend'' from reduced East-West tensions.
   Bush complained again Tuesday about Congress' failure to enact
his aid package, saying both the House and Senate had padded the
bill with irrelevant pet spending projects and controversial
matters.
   ``None of it related to Nicaragua, none of it related to Panama;
all of it related to other priorities they had,'' the president
told a group of small business owners at the White House.
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, in a speech at the
National Press Club, was more understanding. ``This is the price we
pay for democracy,'' he said of the delays. ``It's the best system
... and we want a democracy, (even) with all the delays.''
   Endara said his country would use the $420 million in aid to
rebuild its battered economy and repair damage from the December
U.S. invasion, which installed him in power. But, answering a
question, he said Panama will not ask for more U.S. economic aid
next year.
   By using part of the money to pay off past-due loans to
international banks, Panama would again become eligible to meet
future financial needs through new development loans, he said.
   Endara strongly defended the U.S. invasion, saying that human
rights abuses by former dictator Manuel Noriega justified the
intervention. And he harshly criticized members of the Organization
of American States, saying ``we were really let down'' when they
did not stand up to Noriega.
   ``They were intimidated by outmoded doctrines of
non-intervention. There's a more important principle ... that a
nation should be determined by the will of the people,'' Endara
said.
   During the final day of consideration, the Senate adopted a
series of amendments adding $5 million to the U.N. Environment
Program, $4 million to an education program for gifted and talented
students, and $5 million for the Agriculture Department's Food
Safety Inspection Service.
   Senators also voted 73 to 24 for a non-binding provision urging
Bush not to send to Congress for approval a U.S.-Soviet trade
agreement until Moscow rescinds economic sanctions it has leveled
at the independence-minded republic of Lithuania.
   In addition to the $300 million for Nicaragua and the $70
million for refugee programs Bush had sought, the bill already had
become the vehicle for a host of unrelated provisions. Lawmakers
added hundreds of millions for disaster relief, fighting forest
fires, food stamps, veterans benefits and other domestic programs.
   The package also included authorization for $400 million in loan
guarantees for Israel to build housing for newly arriving Soviet
emigres.
   Before the measure was approved, however, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., raised a series of questions about the housing
program, which he said he supported but needed to be justified for
taxpayers.
   He noted that Israel already receives $3 billion a year in
direct aid, making it the largest recipient of U.S. largesse, and
in addition gets more than $600 million in other ``side benefits.''
   Dole asked whether Israel should get a break on fees for the
loan guarantees, which would save the Israeli government an
estimated $25 million or more over the 30-year life of the loans;
whether requirements for eligibility for the housing should be
waived, as proposed in the bill; and whether the money also would
be used to build roads and parks and pay consultants.

   The Army wants to find the next of kin for six
crewmen who died when their B-17 was lost on a 1942 patrol over the
Coral Sea, officials said Tuesday.
   Although the aircraft was found and the crew list confirmed
after several research missions to Papua, New Guinea, in 1986 and
1987, relatives of six of the eight crewmen haven't been found,
said Shari Lawrence, spokeswoman for the U.S. Total Army Personnel
Command.
   ``The many years since the incident have made the locations
difficult,'' she said in a statement.
   The plane disappeared after leaving from Townsville in
Queensland, Australia. The Army believes the crew encountered the
enemy because the Battle of the Coral Sea occurred in the days
immediately after its disappearance, the statement said.
   The six unidentified crewmen are:
   _2nd Lt. Jim Sam Grant, born Jan. 28, 1918. Last known next of
kin: father Walter C. Grant, Malvern, Ark., and mother Marian P.
Grant, Tuscon, Ariz.

   The Bush administration backed a measure
Tuesday that would triple civil fines for employers who violate
workplace safety laws, but gave only limited support to legislation
that creates new criminal offenses.
   If enacted, the higher civil penalties for Occupational Safety
and Health Administration violations would be the first increase in
OSHA fines in the agency's 20-year history.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's call for higher fines was
viewed by organized labor supporters as a sign she's committed to
worker safety and that the Bush administration is improving OSHA.
Organized labor considered the agency neglected under the Reagan
administration.
   It was the first time OSHA has taken a stand on increased
penalties.
   At a Senate hearing on proposed OSHA changes, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, urged assistant labor secretary Gerard Scannell
to reconsider the agency's opposition to his plan that creates new
felonies for willful violations that result in ``serious bodily
injury'' or ``recklessly endanger human life.''
   Metzenbaum's plan also increases from six months to 10 years the
jail term for willful violations that result in a worker's death.
   Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate labor subcommittee, called
the current six-month jail term an ``absurdly low'' penalty that
sends a message to potential violators.
   ``It says do not worry _ treat worker deaths and injuries as
just another cost of doing business,'' Metzenbaum said.
   OSHA supports changing the crime for a violation that results in
a death from a misdemeanor to a felony, but agency officials
believe sentencing should be left to the courts, Scannell said.
   In addition, OSHA objects to the two new felonies Metzenbaum's
measure creates because civil penalties _ which often result in
employers' quickly correcting workplace hazards _ are easier to
settle than criminal penalties, Scannell said.
   The creation of two new felonies, he said, would damage the
department's ability to get businesses to quickly correct those
hazards because more employers would appeal.
   ``Expansion of the criminal provisions will come at a very high
price, not only the price of diminished civil enforcement, but even
more tragic, the higher price of delayed'' elimination of the
hazards, Scannell said.
   OSHA also announced support for helping state and local
prosecutors in enforcing state criminal statues in relation to
workplace injury or deaths.
   Scannell said OSHA supports a three-fold increase in civil
penalties to bring them in line with inflation.
   Under a plan by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., the $10,000 fine
for knowingly violating OSHA laws would increase to $30,000 while a
lesser violation set at $1,000 would increase to $3,000.
   Business groups testified against the measures to strengthen
OSHA laws, saying they were vague and would harm innocent
businessmen.
   ``Decent and respectable employers will have greater exposure to
criminal penalties ... than bank robbers, drug dealers and common
criminals,'' said Kirk Fordice, president of the Associated General
Contractors of America.
   Fordice complained that the legislation did not address drug use
by employees or acknowledge the need for workers to ``be
accountable for meeting minimum standards of responsibility.''
   An estimated 10,000 workers are killed each year on the job and
about 70,000 others are permanently disabled by workplace
accidents, according to AFL-CIO figures.

   Frank Reed, malnourished but
energetic after his 3{-year ordeal as a hostage in Lebanon,
celebrated his freedom Tuesday with a beer, a large steak and a
long-awaited reunion with his wife and son.
   A special State Department team began questioning the
57-year-old educator at the U.S. Air Force hospital in Wiesbaden,
hoping for clues about the 16 remaining Western hostages in
Lebanon. Six American hostages are still held.
   Reed, who said he spent much of his captivity blindfolded, is
the second American hostage freed since April 22.
   In Malden, Mass., Reed's daughter said he told her he had been
held with American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland
but was separated from them about a year ago. Anderson and
Sutherland are among the six remaining U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   ``He was disturbed that they weren't out. He thought for sure
they would have been released,'' said Marilyn Langston, 33. She
said Reed called her early Tuesday from the military hospital in
West Germany.
   Mrs. Langston said her father said he lost 60 pounds during his
43 months in captivity.
   At the hospital, Reed's doctors performed X-rays and blood tests
and said the former captive showed no initial signs of serious
medical problems.
   Reed lost ``significant weight and muscle mass from a lack of
exercise and a marginal diet,'' the doctors said in a statement.
   They added Reed is ``weak and tired,'' but ``otherwise feels
well and is talking with family and medical staff.'' The hospital
said Reed had indicated he did not want to meet with reporters
Tuesday.
   Reed was reunited at the hospital Tuesday morning with his
Syrian Moslem wife, Fahima, 39, and their 9-year-old son, Tarek,
who had arrived from the United States, where they had been staying
in his hometown of Malden, Mass.
   Military officials said Reed's wife and son went on a quick
shopping tour to buy new clothes for him at the nearby U.S. Lindsey
Air Base.
   Reed displayed a healthy appetite and a strong thirst for beer,
according to the hospital staff.
   For lunch, Reed requested a ``Heineken (beer) and a large steak
cooked medium rare,'' and the freed hostage ``got what he asked
for,'' the hospital statement said.
   He spent the afternoon sleeping and was to have dinner with his
family, hospital officials said.
   In Washington, President Bush called Reed's release ``joyous
news,'' but said he wouldn't be satisifed until all the remaining
hostages are freed.
   Bush, who met at the White House Tuesday with Democratic and
Republican leaders, praised Syria and Iran for exerting pressure on
the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist hostage-takers.
   But the president also prodded the two countries to work for the
release of more hostages, emphasizing they should not expect normal
relations or ``vast improvement until all Americans are freed.''
   ``When a step is taken that goes toward that day when all
hostages are released, I should say thank you,'' Bush said. ``But
beyond that, I can't say that I can be happy.''
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon. He was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Bush said he would not object if Israel were to release Shiite
prisoners as the Lebanese hostage-takers have demanded.
   Israeli officials, reacting to the indirect U.S. appeal,
insisted that Israel wanted three Israeli soldiers captured in
Lebanon in 1986 to be part of any deal. The three are believed held
by radical Shiites linked to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia.
   A leading Iranian newspaper, the Tehran Times, said Tuesday that
Iran's leaders expect a reciprocal gesture of good will from
Washington if another U.S. hostage is to be freed.
   The newspaper said Iran and the Lebanese militants expect
Washington and its allies to pressure Israel into releasing ``a
significant number of detainees,'' specifically Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid, a Shiite cleric abducted by Israel in southern Lebanon in
July.
   Bush met Monday with former hostage Robert Polhill, who was
freed on April 22. The president said Polhill had given him a
secret message from his captors, but refused to disclose its
contents.
   Reed's kidnappers, who called themselves the Organization of the
Islamic Dawn, announced before Reed's release that he would be
carrying a message to President Bush.
   Reed, who had been principal of a private school in Beirut since
1977, refused to comment on any message. He was kidnapped Sept. 9,
1986.
   He was released Monday night into Syrian hands in west Beirut
and then escorted to Damascus, just as Polhill was last week.
   Reed blew kisses, flashed a ``V'' for victory sign to
well-wishers and touched the ground in undisguised elation after
arriving in brilliant, sunny weather Tuesday at Rhein-Main Air Base
from Syria on a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport plane.
   He was then flown by Army helicopter to the hospital in nearby
Wiesbaden.
   Reed, still bearded and wearing a dark suit and white shirt,
walked with relatively brisk steps from the helicopter, smiling
broadly.
   He gave a thumbs-up to reporters and about 170 military and
medical personnel waiting for him at the hospital.
   Banners draped over the hospital balconies proclaimed ``Welcome
Back to the Free World'' and ``Welcome Home, Mr. Reed.''
   At the hospital, Reed was provided with a new pair of reading
glasses, officials said.
   After his release, Reed said that during his ``lonely and
boring'' captivity he had been shut off from news of the outside
world and sometimes ``didn't even know what month it was.''
   Officials said Reed would probably remain at the hospital for
the next two to three days before returning to the United States.

   Three kinds of cancer and five other diseases
among Vietnam veterans can be traced to exposure to the defoliant
Agent Orange, according to a scientific report released Tuesday by
veterans groups.
   The report, released on the eve of a congressional hearing on a
bill to pay benefits to Agent Orange victims, produced no new
evidence. Rather, it reviewed existing studies.
   Lawmakers pushing the benefits praised the study by the Agent
Orange Task Force, seven scientists assembled by the American
Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America and the National Veterans Legal
Services Program.
   ``It is not only appropriate but it is scientifically correct''
to award compensation to Vietnam veterans exposed to the
dioxin-containing defoliant, said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a
Vietnam veteran and sponsor of Senate legislation to award
compensation.
   The report said proof exists of a ``significant statistical
association'' between herbicide exposure and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma; soft-tissue sarcoma; chloracne and other skin disorders;
early liver disease; and porphyria cutanea tarda, a metabolic
disorder.
   The scientists also said there was enough evidence to give the
benefit of the doubt in awarding compensation to veterans who were
exposed and suffer from Hodgkin's disease, neurologic and
reproductive problems and developmental problems with their
offspring.
   They say there's limited evidence of an association between
exposure and a large number of cancers, as well as immunological
abnormalities and psychological problems.
   A Senate bill has been passed and a House bill introduced to
provide benefits to veterans who claim their diseases were a result
of exposure. The bills differ in cost _ $36 million for the Senate
version and $89 million for the House version _ length of coverage
and number of diseases covered.
   A Veterans Affairs subcommittee was scheduled to hear testimony
Wednesday on the House bill sponsored by Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a
co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in Congress.
   Both bills would create an independent panel of scientists under
the auspices of the independent National Academy of Sciences to
review herbicide studies. Critics say the government has
intentionally tried to influence the evidence on Agent Orange to
avoid paying benefits.
   VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski has decided to award benefits
to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma sufferers who served in Vietnam. That
decision was made March 29 as the result of a study by the Centers
for Disease Control.
   About 35,000 veterans have filed claims asserting a connection
between exposure and a variety of ailments. Only a handful _ those
for chloracne _ have been granted.
   About 240,000 veterans believe they may have been exposed to the
herbicide and have requested physical examinations, VA says. A
total of 12 million gallons of Agent Orange was sprayed during the
war to remove ground cover and crops.
   Agent Orange is a phenoxyacetic herbicide contaminated with
dioxin during manufacture. Dioxin is the main disease-causing
suspect.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has labeled dioxin a
``probable human carcinogen.''
   The scientists on the panel say an influential private study of
Nitro, W.Va., Monsanto workers exposed to dioxin has been
discredited because of allegations of scientific fraud. So has an
important study of industrial workers in Ludwigshafen, West
Germany, they said.
   The scientists were especially critical of the VA and CDC for
ignoring animal studies, especially because agencies such as the
EPA gives them such strong consideration.
   VA scientists say the animal dioxin studies are less reliable
because of the variety of reactions from species to species, and
because there is documented human exposure, said VA spokeswoman
Donna St. John.
   The two bills cover only a few of the ailments: non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and chloracne. The House
version adds melanoma and basal cell carcinoma.
   Oliver Meadows, the chairman of the VA's outside Environmental
Hazards Advisory Committee, dismissed criticism in the new report
that it ignored a large number of studies and that it used a
``simplistic tallying system'' to weigh data.
   The panel has only examined the connection between Agent Orange
and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The new report covers all the possible
ailments.
   The panel found in November that an association cannot be proved
or disproved. The VA panel meets later this month to consider other
cancer studies.
   The CDC study of six kinds kinds of cancer found an increased
risk of only one _ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma _ among Vietnam veterans.
It found no such increase in soft tissue sarcoma, Hodgkin's
disease, and nasal, nasopharyngeal and primary liver cancer.
   The study looked only indirectly at Agent Orange exposure.

   Riot police on horseback and on foot charged
a May Day march near the center of Mexico City with clubs swinging,
leaving several demonstrators bleeding with head wounds.
   The marchers represented a group of independent unions headed
for the main plaza, or Zocalo, as a larger demonstration by
pro-government unions was dispersing.
   Police held up the march, apparently waiting for the other
groups to leave, then charged. It was not clear what set off the
attack, during which some marchers hurled bricks and rocks at
police.
   The procession later left for the plaza as demonstrators carried
away the wounded. The number of injured was not immediately clear.
   The Mexican government news agency Notimex said three policemen
and four journalists, mostly Mexican photographers, were injured
but Associated Press reporters saw several others who had been
beaten.
   In the plaza, the marchers hauled down from a building a huge
banner from a pro-government labor group and set it afire.
   At least three major labor groups declined to join the official
rally of the Mexican Labor Federation in the Zocalo. Several
independent unions held separate marches to the plaza.
   Among the chants shouted was ``Aware worker, don't give up,
don't sell out!''
   Ranks of members of pro-government unions had marched around the
huge square past the National Palace to greet the President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, then marched out. Unofficial estimates put the
number of marchers at around 200,000.
   Some in the Mexican Labor Federation demonstration said they had
to attend. ``It is forced,'' said a worker from an automobile brake
plant, who demanded anonymity. ``If you don't go they will discount
two days from your salary.''
   About 10,000 other marchers from non-government-aligned unions
headed for the Zocalo as the Mexican Labor Federation demonstration
dispersed.
   Two groups marched past the U.S. Embassy shouting ``Gringo
thieves, to the firing squad!''
   ``We are hungry'' read a banner carried by workers in the
Treasury Department.
   The Mexican Electrical Workers' Union said it would not take
part in the CTM rally because it did not want to risk incidents
``resulting from the unrest there is among the workers,'' the
weekly Proceso said Monday. The Revolutionary Workers' Federation
was boycotting to protest what it said were low wages.
   The teachers' union, Mexico's largest, said it would stay home,
but a dissident movement that claims support of about half the more
than 1 million members called one of the three separate
demonstrations.
   Behind the demonstrations walked 10 city sanitation workers with
brooms and bright orange uniforms. One of them, Domingo Rendon,
sighed, ``The day of the worker means more work for us.''
   For decades, Fidel Velazquez, the 90-year-old head of the
Mexican Labor Federation and a stalwart of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, defused labor unrest and turned
out the vote for the party.
   With national economic crisis, workers have lost ground and with
it patience with their leaders and the system.
   The labor federation has at various times claimed a membership
of as many as 5 million. Labor analysts estimate it at about half
of that.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Would Forgive Billions in Food Aid Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants to forgive some
of the $11.7 billion owed by more than 70 countries for U.S. food
aid, officials told Congress Tuesday.
   It has still to decide how much would be forgiven and which
countries would benefit.
   William C. Ramsay, deputy assistant secretary of state for
energy, resources and food policy, said they would be the poorest
countries, if they have promised the World Bank or the
International Monetary Fund to undertake new policies.
   The last requirement would exclude Egypt, for example, which
owes the most, $2.6 billion. Egypt has been negotiating with the
fund for years, but has so far found its terms too difficult.
   South Korea, which still owes over $600 million, is too well off
for debt forgiveness, according to an official of the U.S. Agency
for International Development.
   Most of the beneficiaries would be African countries, to which
Bush has already promised forgiveness of $1 billion worth of other
debt. Ramsay said poor countries outside Africa, such as Bangladesh
and Haiti, may also win forgiveness of the food debt.
   Bangladesh owes over $1 billion for food aid, as do Indonesia
and Pakistan.
   Ramsay also asked for authority to make more grants of food aid
instead of loans on generous terms. ``Many countries in urgent need
of food aid have such large debt service burdens and weak economies
that they can no longer afford even these generous terms,'' he said.
   Ramsay testified before the subcommittee on international
economic policy of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is
considering bills that would allow the debt forgiveness envisioned
by Ramsay.
   The chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn,
said he was sympathetic to the administration's plans for debt
forgiveness,

<HEAD>Quayle Advance Team Member Accused of Sexual Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of Vice President Dan Quayle's
advance team has been accused of sexually assaulting a Baylor
University student, and Quayle's press secretary said Tuesday the
man has been relieved of his duties.
   Police said Tuesday no warrant has been issued and the man has
not been charged with a crime. The 18-year-old student was
uncertain whether she wanted to press charges, police said.
   Waco policeman Lionel McGee said the woman, a freshman, told
police Sunday that the man raped her in his hotel room.
   The man said he had sex with the woman but that she consented,
according to a police report.
   Waco lawyer Charles McDonald, who has been retained by the man,
said his client is innocent. ``Nothing has been shown that would
justify the complaint,'' he said.
   A statement issued Tuesday by Quayle's press secretary, David
Beckwith, said the man would retain his consulting position with
the Republican National Committee pending an investigation but
volunteered to step down from his duties planning an upcoming trip
to Texas by Quayle.
   ``This is a most deplorable incident. We extend our sympathy to
the young lady, her friends and her family,'' the statement said.
``We are asking the local authorities to show no favoritism and to
deal with this according to their standard procedures.''
   The man has had a consulting agreement with the Republican
National Committee since April 23, said committee press secretary
Leslie Goodman. His work at the RNC involves special projects,
including political trips for candidates.
   Quayle is scheduled to visit Waco on Wednesday for a private
fund-raiser to benefit state Rep. Hugh Shine, a GOP nominee for
Congress.
   Prosecutor Ralph Strother of the McLennan County district
attorney's office said Tuesday that without the woman's
cooperation, there would be little prospect of prosecuting the man.
   ``I cannot tell you at this point whether there will be any
formal charges filed,'' Strother said.

<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday offered to meet
opposition parties threatening to boycott Romania's first free
elctions in more than 50 years.
   The move follows the accusation by five major opposition parties
that the National Salvation Front, which dominates the provisional
governing coalition, is monopolizing power. The opposition parties
on Monday threatened to boycott the May 20 elections.
   The government offer also comes as a round-the-clock
anti-government protest in Bucharest entered its 10th day.
   The goverment said claims that the National Salvation Front was
harassing opposition activists and using facilities left by the
deposed Communist Party ``can be discussed with representatives of
the government to eliminate any kind of suspicions and to ...
improve some organizational aspects'' of the elections.
   The statement said the goverment would guarantee ``the equality
of chances from a technical point of view'' for all parties
contesting the election.
   The five opposition parties that are threatening to boycott the
elections are the National Peasants' Party, the National Liberal
Party, the Social Democrat Party, the Free Democrat Party and the
Socialist Liberal Party.
   There was no immediate response from the parties to the
goverment statement.
   In Bucharest 8,000 protesters gathered in downtown University
Square to protest against the government of interim President Ion
Iliescu, which they claim favors preserving Communism. Iliescu is a
former Communist official who became a critic of Ceausescu's in
recent years.
   Organizers of the anti-Communist protest said they have
collected 4 million signatures for a petition to exclude all former
Communists from politics and government. There was no way to
independently verify their claim.
   The National Salvation Front began ruling as an interim
government shortly after the December revolution that deposed
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. It then brought in opposition
figures to form a coalition government but remained the dominant
force.
   On Tuesday, the crowed stood singing and chanting under a giant
banner that read, ``Iliescu _ go back to where you came from.''
   Twenty-one people said they had started a fast to enforce the
rally's demands.
   Nicolae Trifu, a bank official from Ploeisti, 30 miles north of
Bucharest, said the government should end its control of the
state-run network.
   ``Television should no longer be subordinated to the government
and to Iliescu in particular,'' he told the crowd.
   His comments were greeted with a sea of ``V'' for victory signs
and chants of ``Resign, Resign'' and ``Down with Iliescu.''
   Opposition parties have long complained that the National
Salvation Front has an unfair advantage in the elections because of
its domination of the television network.
   Reporters in the western city of Timisoara, where the revolution
began, said about 1,000 anti-Iliescu demonstrators assembled
Tuesday for a protest. There were no other details.

<HEAD>Darman Warns Against Centralized Economy For Environmentalism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates of a centralized,
command-and-control economy, hiding behind the ``green mask'' of
environmentalism, are threatening to undermine Americans' self
confidence and pioneering spirit, Budget Director Richard Darman
warned Tuesday.
   Even though the conflict between Western democracies and
Communist bloc nations is in decline, different economic ideologies
_ both labeled environmentalism _ will continue to compete for
dominance, Darman said in a speech at Harvard University, a text of
which was released in Washington.
   He identified two kinds of environmentalism _ ``pro-growth,
market-oriented, pluralistic environmentalism'' and ``anti-growth,
command-and-control, centralistic enviromentalism.''
   ``Because so many people are self-proclaimed
`environmentalists,' the label is no longer a meaningful
characteristic. It is a green mask under which different faces of
politico-economic ideology can hide,'' he added.
   The budget director said Americans ``must counter the tendency
to become a risk-o-phobic society'' because prudent risk-taking is
central to the U.S. spirit and standard of living.
   ``If we were to regulate houses with the same principles we now
apply to our food and air, for example, we would all have to live
in single-story homes _ for fear of falling down stairs,'' he said.
   Darman, along with White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, are
viewed as the two senior White House aides most skeptical of
strengthening regulation of the environment and have argued in
support of toning down presidental statements on global warming and
other environmental problems.

   The House approved legislation Tuesday that
establishes boundaries for the Gettysburg National Military Park,
where President Lincoln delivered his historic address and the
Union and Confederate armies fought a key battle of the Civil War.
   By voice vote, the House adopted the bill that allows the
Interior Department to acquire land and interests in land within
the established boundaries by purchase, donation, exchange or other
means.
   The park, which was transferred from the War Department to the
National Park Service in 1933, includes approximately 3,900 acres
of Pennsylvania land, including about 3,700 that are owned by the
federal government.
   The bill also establishes an 11-member advisory commission to
join with local jurisdictions in managing the park and the
Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District.
   The measure also calls on the Interior Department to take steps
that encourage conservation of the park.
   The House Interior Committee said the bill will result in only a
minimal increase in federal spending. It did not provide specifics.

<TEXT>
   The purchasers in the biggest savings and loan
bailout of 1988 are enjoying millions of dollars of risk-free
profits and regulators should renegotiate the deal, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum said Tuesday.
   The Ohio Democrat said a Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas memo
obtained by his Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust shows
taxpayers likely would have been better off if regulators
liquidated First Gibraltar Bank of Houston rather than bailing it
out in December 1988.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, then the chief regulator of
thrift institutions, estimated it would have cost $5 billion to
shut down the five bankrupt thrifts that were combined to form
First Gibraltar.
   However, a memo prepared in February 1989 by analyst Jeff Potter
in Dallas said the liquidation cost was ``grossly overstated'' by
about $1.6 billion, Metzenbaum said, indicating the sale may have
been unnecessary.
   Instead of liquidating, the bank board pledged $5 billion in
future aid and $1.2 billion in tax benefits to New York financier
and Revlon chairman Ronald O. Perelman and other investors, who put
up $315 million.
   Including the tax benefits, First Gibraltar, now the largest
thrift in Texas and among the 20 largest in the nation, enjoyed the
best return on investment of any thrift in the nation last year,
according to Metzenbaum's aides.
   It received $461 million in federal assistance in 1989, enabling
it to post a profit of $129 million, the senator said.
   ``These overly generous payments are government guarantees that
give little incentive to manage the assets of the S&amp;L profitably.
They also suggest that the government ... drove a very poor bargain
for taxpayers,'' Metzenbaum said in a letter to L. William Seidman,
chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., which has assumed
responsibility for reviewing the 1988 bailouts.
   Metzenbaum said the findings of his staff, which reviewed 35,000
documents related to the 1988 deals, ``dramatically underscore''
the need to renegotiate the First Gibraltar sale and other
transactions.
   ``Our investigation has found evidence that bidding on several
... deals was irregular and done in haste. Billions in federal
subsidies and thrift assets were juggled in a rush to close as many
deals as possible before the end of 1988,'' he wrote.
   First Gibraltar Chairman Gerald J. Ford defended his
institution's deal with the government, saying it was concluded
after a ``vigorous and highly competitive auction.''
   He said his S&amp;L has restored stability and depositor confidence
to the Texas thrift industry through ``a forward-looking program of
assets management, branch consolidation and operating
efficiencies.''
   Federal regulators, at the time of the 1988 deals, defended the
transactions as the best they could do. Because they lacked the
cash to pay off depositors, they were forced to keep insolvent
institutions afloat by pledging future assistance, they said.

<HEAD>10,500 Soviets Immigrate To Israel In April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 10,500 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel in
April, the largest monthly figure since the start of a mass Soviet
immigration to the Jewish state last year, an official said Tuesday.
   It was the first time Israel published a figure for Soviet
arrivals since early March, when such statistics were censored in
response to Arab guerrilla threats to attack immigrants.
   Gad Ben Ari, the spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish
Agency, which is partly responsible for resettling the immigrants,
said 10,500 arrived in April. He added Israel's goal is ``to bring
the maximum amount of people in the minimum amount of time.''
   Before April, the monthly immigration figure for Soviet Jews was
between 4,000 and 6,000, Israeli and foreign reports said. In 1989,
12,000 Soviets settled in Israel, and in 1988 only 2,000 arrived.
   The relaxation in the censorship of immigration statistics
appears to be a result of pressure from overseas fundraisers,
particularly those in the United States. Fundraisers say they need
the immigration figures in their drives to raise money to absorb
the newcomers.
   Israeli officials estimate up to 300,000 Soviet Jews will
emigrate to Israel in the next few years. The influx comes because
of a loosening of immigration procedures in the Soviet Union and
tighter restrictions on U.S. immigration.

<TEXT>
   An angry judge ordered Zsa Zsa
Gabor to perform 60 extra hours of community service Tuesday,
saying fund raising at her Bel-Air mansion was not the way to serve
time for slapping a policeman.
   ``If there is any violation of probation, County Jail will be
the sanction,'' warned Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin.
   He asked Miss Gabor if she accepted his decision.
   ``Yes, what can I do?'' Miss Gabor said.
   ``You could go to jail. Do you want that?'' the judge shot back.
   ``Yes, I accept,'' Miss Gabor said, referring to the community
service hours.
   ``It's outrageous,'' the former Hungarian beauty queen later
told about 80 reporters.
   Miss Gabor, 72, was sentenced last year to 120 hours of
community service on her conviction of slapping a Beverly Hills
motorcycle policeman who stopped her Rolls-Royce last June for
expired registration tags.
   Rubin originally ordered her to do the service at the Lower
Income Elderly United Community Assistance Program in Venice, with
the time to be completed by March 30.
   Rubin ordered Tuesday's hearing after he received a sparse
account from the shelter's executive director, Vera Davis, about
how Miss Gabor spent her time.
   Davis said Miss Gabor spent about 50 hours at the shelter and
the rest of the time working from her Bel-Air mansion, organizing a
June 8 fund-raiser for the shelter.
   ``It's clear to me the defendant had a rather lax attitude about
it,'' Rubin said.
   ``(It) means nothing to Miss Gabor, buying community service
hours. She is a wealthy person,'' Rubin said after meeting with
Miss Gabor and her attorney, Harrison Bull for 3{ hours. ``The
primary motive was Miss Gabor's promotion, and not fund raising.
   ``I repeated numerous times (at the original sentencing) that
she perform community service at the center.''
   Miss Gabor later told reporters: ``I served food. Why do I have
to promote myself? I'm so damned famous it's sickening.''
   Rubin gave Miss Gabor credit for 34{ hours of community service
time from her 120-hour sentence. He ordered her to serve the
remaining 85{ hours, plus 60 penalty hours.
   ``Miss Gabor must now document her community service time and
there will be random, in-person verification,'' the judge said.
   The remaining 145{ hours must be completed by Sept. 28 and the
hours will be served at several agencies.
   ``You may not do any fund raising'' as a part of the community
service, the judge ordered.
   ``I don't have any qualms with Miss Gabor's assistance and fund
raising,'' said Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox, but ``there is
an aspect of humility that goes along with this.''
   He said community service usually includes handling telephones
or serving food.

<BYLINE>Group Wants Commitment to Math
^By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of students interested in mathematics
have dropped out for other careers, a National Research Council
report said Tuesday in calling for renewed commitment to math
education.
   ``The attrition rate for students in the mathematical sciences
is 50 percent per year, the highest among all scientific fields,''
said the report, ``Renewing U.S. Mathematics: Critical Resources
for the Future.''
   ``Bright young people are discouraged from pursuing careers in
the mathematical sciences because they find their career prospects
are dim.''
   The report said there were about 3.6 million ninth grade
mathematics students in 1972. By the time they entered college as
freshmen in 1976, the number had dropped to 294,000. In 1980 11,000
won bachelor's degrees in mathematics; two years later 2,700
master's degrees were awarded and 400 doctorates were bestowed in
1986.
   ``Professors must show students that the mathematical sciences
offer both intellectual excitement and attractive career
prospects,'' said the report. ``Providing intellectual excitement
is the responsibility of the mathematical sciences community.
   ``To perceive attractive career prospects, students must see in
their own mathematics departments active, successful research
enterprises that involve graduate students, young faculty, and
senior researchers, all supported at levels competitive with those
in the other sciences and engineering.''
   A key recommendation of the report is that federal support of
mathematics education increase to $250 million annually from $133
million over the next three years.
   The report is a follow up to a 1984 study which called for $180
million a year. The committee that produced the report said that
inflation had pushed that amount to $225 million.
   The money should be used mostly to increase the numbers of
senior, junior and postdoctoral researchers and graduate research
assistants, the committee said.
   Edward David Jr., chairman of both the 1984 and the present
study committee, said that ``I think we would be much closer'' to
realizing the goal of President Bush and the nation's governors of
becoming first in math and science if all of the 1984 suggestions
had been carried out.
   ``The chances are very good'' that the new report will be fully
supported ``because of the attitude of the president, Congress and
the governors,'' said David. ``We got everybody on our side and
chances are very good.''

<HEAD>Lithuanian Premier Says Cities of Moscow, Leningrad Will Help
Republic</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Lithuania</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
said Tuesday that the cities of Moscow and Leningrad have agreed to
help Lithuania ease the pressure of the Soviet Union's economic
embargo on the rebellious republic.
   She did not say what practical help was offered, but the Baltic
republic of 3.8 million people sent a delegation to Leningrad last
week to talk with local officials about a direct exchange of goods
either for hard currency or barter.
   Mrs. Prunskiene told reporters outside the Ontario legislature
that reform municipal councils in Leningrad, Moscow and elsewhere
in the Soviet Union offered to assist Lithuania because they rely
on it for food supplies.
   ``Because of the Kremlin's blockade we have taken the intiative
for direct contact with these cities,'' she through an interpreter.
   ``These people think the way we do and we consider them our
friends. Not only do they support our independence initiatives but
they also want to cooperate with us in practical terms because they
receive many of their food supplies from us.''
   Mrs. Prunskiene is in Canada as part of a North American swing
to ask for more economic ties with her republic. She is to meet
Thursday with President Bush at the White House.
   Lithuania has struggled for two weeks since the Soviets cut
supplies of fuel, medicine and other goods following Lithuania's
March 11 declaration of independence.
   The Kremlin does not recognize the declaration, saying Lithuania
must follow Soviet law on secession.
   Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in
1940.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she is confident Lithuania will get help
from other Soviet republics and regions.
   ``The only way that this could be prevented or stopped would be
by armed intervention, but it is very doubtful whether any nation
can solve its economic problems with the use of force,'' she said
at a luncheon of Ontario government officials, with Ontario Prime
Minister David Peterson.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said she is in Canada with a trade delegation
seeking to establish closer economic ties, not to look for charity.
   Peterson said the province will likely send a trade delegation
to Lithuania this year.
   On Monday in Ottawa, Mrs. Prunskiene said her government is
prepared to suspend some items in its independence declaration to
open negotiations with the Soviet Union. She made clear on Tuesday
that Lithuania will not sacrifice its goal of independence.
   ``The act of independence ... is untouchable,'' she said.
   Since Lithuania declared its independence, Canada has urged
negotiations and dialogue between the two sides.
   Mrs. Prunskiene returns to Lithuania on Saturday.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Tuesday he would allow
sworn videotaped statements from two key defense witnesses in the
Philippines to be introduced at Imelda Marcos' fraud trial.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorneys say one of the witnesses, Orlando Dulay,
will testify that he was present when Ferdinand Marcos recovered a
hoard of gold known as the Yamashita treasure, and that he helped
transport the gold to Marcos' home.
   The Yamashita treasure was a huge cache of gold supposed to have
been hidden in the Philippines by Gen. Tomoyuki Yamashita, the
Japanese military commander stationed there in the closing days of
World War II.
   Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii last September, claimed that
the gold was the primary source of his wealth. No evidence of the
gold has ever been found.
   ``Proof of this serendipitous discovery would be offered to
refute the government's contention that Marcos amassed his wealth
through systematic plundering of the Philippine treasury,'' U.S.
District Judge John F. Keenan said in a written ruling.
   The judge also approved the taking of a deposition from Fransico
Tantuico, who was in charge of the Philippine Audit Organization
between 1976 and 1986. Tantuico will testify that reports prepared
by his department disprove allegations of corruption by the
Marcoses.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of helping her late husband loot the
Philippine treasury of more than $220 million to buy New York
properties and support lavish living.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, is charged
with helping the Marcoses conceal their ownership of four New York
buildings and artworks purchased with the allegedly stolen funds.
   Keenan said lawyers for Mrs. Marcos can interview the witnesses
in the Philippines during the second week of June, when the trial
will be in recess. The videotaped statements will then be shown to
jurors.
   The judge denied a motion to allow Mrs. Marcos to go to the
Philippines with her attorneys. He also ruled against allowing her
lawyers to interview President Corazon Aquino, who ousted Marcos,
and numerous other potential defense witnesses.
   Keenan said defense claims that the U.S. and Philippine
governments were ``hectoring'' and intimidating potential defense
witnesses in the Philippines ``appear exaggerated.''
   The Aquino government has refused to let Mrs. Marcos return
since she and her husband left the country after Marcos' defeat as
president in February 1986.
   Testimony Tuesday focused on the alleged embezzlement of funds
in the Philippines.
   One witness said the chief of the agency that handled Japanese
war reparations to the Philippines took ``commissions'' that were
deposited into Swiss bank accounts held by Marcos.
   Andres Genito, a former employee of two Japanese trading
companies, said he made the payments to Gen. Eugenio Balao, a close
Marcos associate who was in charge of the War Reparations
Commission from 1966 until it expired in the mid 1970s.
   ``I jokingly told him, General Balao, that this is a large sum
of money. Is it for you? He said, `Are you kidding, this goes to
President Marcos,''' said Genito, who now owns a liquor store in
Los Angeles.
   The witness testified that he accompanied Balao on numerous
occasions to Hong Kong, where the general converted the commissions
from Japanese yen to U.S. dollars. Genito said Balao told him he
deposited the money into Swiss accounts held by Marcos.
   Genito said he made the payments during all the years Balao
served on the reparations commission, but he did not say how much
money was involved.

<HEAD>Threatening Letters Sent To Ex-Beatle George Harrison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday night they are investigating
threatening letters sent to former Beatle George Harrison.
   Harrison, 47, received the letters at his mansion in Friar Park
near Henley 35 miles west of central London, where he lives with
his wife, Olivia, 42, and their 12-year-old son, Dhani.
   Inspector Patrick Wilmore of Thames Valley police said: ``We are
looking into a matter of certain threatening letters to George
Harrison.'' He did not elaborate.
   Another ex-Beatle, John Lennon, was slain outside his New York
apartment by a deranged gunman on Dec. 8, 1980. The rock music
group broke up in 1970 after eight years of success.
   A London newspaper, the Daily Mirror, said the singer-guitarist
had received five anonymous, handwritten letters in recent weeks
threatening him with death.
   The tabloid said each of the five bore postmarks indicating they
were mailed in south London. It said one of the letters stated
``Time you went'' and another said ``Goodbye George.''
   The paper said Harrison has been haunted by fear of an assassin
ever since Lennon was slain and is constantly accompanied by a
bodyguard.

<HEAD>House Embraces Democratic 1991 Budget That Spurns Bush Plan</HEAD>

   The House on Tuesday adopted the Democrats'
$1.2 trillion federal budget for next year, making deep cuts in
President Bush's defense plans and channeling much of the savings
into social programs.
   Before the vote, Democrats taunted the Republicans for
abandoning the administration's own spending plan.
   Meanwhile, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser finally
lined up enough votes for his committee to approve a budget of its
own, a congressional source said.
   Until now, solid GOP opposition and several balking Democrats
have prevented the panel from drawing up a spending package. But
Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., told Sasser he would support a plan that
claims to reduce next year's deficit by $43 billion, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   That would produce a majority on the panel for the proposal,
which could approve a budget as early as Wednesday. The plan would
allow $294 billion for defense spending, officials said.
   On a 218-208 largely party-line vote, the Democratic-controlled
House adopted a plan that would provide $295.5 billion for next
year's military programs. That is $8.3 billion less than Bush
proposed and $11.5 billion below the amount needed to keep pace
with inflation, a step supporters said was merited by eased
tensions with the Soviet bloc.
   ``The budget here provides for a transition from a Cold War
economy to a peacetime economy, and that is what we need to do for
the future,'' said the plan's chief architect, House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Republicans opposed the package en masse, with all 174 GOP
lawmakers who cast ballots voting against it. They criticized it as
weak on defense and argued that any budget will be meaningless
unless negotiations with the White House first yield agreements on
its components.
   They were joined by 34 Democrats who voted against the measure.
   ``This is the Dukakis platform. This is the Mondale platform.
This is the Carter presidency. This is the McGovern movement,''
said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the No. 2 GOP leader, recalling the
ghosts of the recent Democratic past.
   But much of the debate centered on the Republican decision not
to offer Bush's own spending blueprint for a vote, reversing a
customary practice. Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking
Republican on the House Budget Committee, revealed the change of
heart late Monday, saying the president's package had been ``passed
by by economic and political events.''
   ``Perhaps that speaks louder than even offering the president's
budget,'' said Panetta. ``To govern is to choose, not to run and
hide, not to cop out.''
   Frenzel replied, ``In our judgment, leadership required meeting
with the president two months ago'' to negotiate a compromise
budget.
   Realizing they would not be able to rely on any GOP support,
Democrats brought Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., to the floor.
He rallied his members by asking them to show that ``we can march,
not drift into the next century.''
   Aiming to reshape Bush's defense plans, the Democratic budget
places long-range constraints on Pentagon spending.
   The plan shrinks defense budget authority to $283 billion, $24
billion less than Bush. Budget authority is the amount of spending
the Pentagon can commit itself to for programs that may last
several years, such as the purchase of a warship. Limiting that
figure would necessitate future cuts in defense.
   The House package would spend $224.3 billion _ $5.6 billion more
than Bush _ on dozens of domestic and foreign aid programs ranging
from grants to scientists to protecting abused children.
   The plan seeks to slash $36 billion from next year's deficit,
the same amount proposed by Bush but with a different mix. Both
sides would rely on $13.9 billion in new tax receipts, but the
president wants higher savings from benefit programs while
Democrats rely more on defense cuts.
   This year's shortfall is expected by the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office to reach $158 billion. But under the
budget process's peculiar mathematics, the proposed cuts would
enable lawmakers to meet the Gramm-Rudman law's requirement for a
1991 budget gap of no more than $64 billion. The 1991 fiscal year
begins Oct. 1.
   The government will have to pay $183 billion in interest next
year on the $3 trillion national debt, nearly 15 percent of all
federal spending.
   Before final passage, the House rejected by 334-90 a budget
offered by the liberal Congressional Black Caucus. It would have
limited defense spending to $279.5 billion and boosted spending for
housing, education and other domestic programs.
   The budget maps the government's fiscal plans for the year, but
leaves binding spending and tax decisions for later bills.

<HEAD>`Twin Peaks' Season To End On May 23</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's surreal ``Twin Peaks'' series, slipping in
the ratings despite critical acclaim, will end its season on
Wednesday, May 23, instead of its usual Thursday slot, ABC says.
   The shift was made because the network wanted to have the show's
finale included in the May ratings ``sweeps'' that end on May 23, a
network spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   ``Twin Peaks'' was the nation's fifth most-watched show in the
week it premiered last month. But it has steadily declined in
ratings, and was 45th in the national Nielsen standings for last
week.
   ABC said in a statement that it won't comment on whether the
series has a future until May 21, when it announces its fall
program schedule.

<HEAD>Food Rationing in Lithuania; Warnings on Latvian Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food rationing began Tuesday in Lithuania, the
target of a Kremlin economic embargo, and about 4,000 pro-Moscow
Communists derided the republic's independence-minded leaders at a
sedate May Day rally.
   The republic's prime minister said city governments in Moscow
and Leningrad would help Lithuania ease the pressure of the embargo.
   In neighboring Latvia, the head of the Communist Party warned of
``tragic consequences'' if the republic follows Lithuania's
secessionist course _ a move that may come this week.
   While unofficial May Day demonstrators in the Kremlin's Red
Square were shouting ``Freedom for Lithuania,'' the pro-Moscow
faction of the Baltic republic's Communist Party rallied on Lenin
Square in the capital of Vilnius and unfurled banners that read
``Workers Say No to Lithuania's Secession from the U.S.S.R.''
   Lithuania's Communist Party has split into two factions _ a
pro-independence party and a smaller, pro-Moscow party.
   The official Tass news agency said mass media in Lithuania
blacked out coverage of the May Day rally, and it noted speakers at
the rally protested what it called the ``hasty decisions'' made by
the republic's parliament, the Supreme Council, which declared
independence March 11.
   Vilnius Radio said the May Day rally lasted about 20 minutes,
was neither ``noisy nor disorderly,'' and was attended by ``those
people who cannot think differently, who are unable to cross the
certain framework of thinking because of the ideology which had
been enforced on them during all these years.''
   Soviet TV's national newscast ``Vremya'' showed a sparse parade
of mostly older people marching along the streets of Vilnius.
   Rationing on certain foodstuffs went into effect Tuesday but the
coupons themselves won't be distributed until Wednesday because of
the holiday, said Daina Kalendra, a worker at the Supreme Council's
information office.
   May Day was an official holiday in the republic of 3.8 million
people, despite the independence drive, and most stores were closed.
   Ms. Kalendra said that for the months of May and June, each
person is limited to the following: sugar, 4.4 pounds; macaroni,
2.2 pounds; grains, 4.4 pounds; salt, 2.2 pounds; flour, 4.4
pounds; grease or margarine, about a half-pound.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev halted shipments of oil,
natural gas and other raw materials to Lithuania last month because
the republic refused to reverse some of the laws it enacted to
bolster its independence.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis sent a congratulatory
message to Gorbachev on the occasion of the May Day workers'
holiday, Ms. Kalendra said, and noted with irony that some
Lithuanians had lost their jobs because of the economic sanctions.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, who is visiting
Canada to try to establish closer trade ties, said she hopes
neighboring Latvia will declare its independence soon.
   ``We're particularly sensitive to see what will occur in
Latvia,'' she said in Toronto. ``Our fight would be almost
impossible without the support and help of republics within the
Soviet Union.
   Later Tuesday, she said new reform city governments in Leningrad
and Moscow have offered to help Lithuania with the embargo.
   ``Not only do they support our independence initiatives but they
also want to cooperate with us in practical terms because they
receive many of their food supplies from us,'' she said through an
interpreter.
   The leader of Latvia's pro-Moscow Communist Party, Alfred
Rubiks, told a May Day rally that the party was alarmed at recent
calls for secession from the Soviet Union, Riga Radio reported.
   On Monday, the Latvian Citizens' Congress _ a shadow parliament
representing 700,000 of Latvia's 2.7 million people _ demanded the
Baltic republic declare independence. On Thursday and Friday,
Latvia's official Supreme Soviet parliament will consider emulating
Lithuania's declaration of independence.
   The Citizens' Congress claims the right to replace the Supreme
Soviet. Tass reported Tuesday that the congress adopted a package
of documents aimed at restoring the regime that existed prior to
Moscow's forced annexation of Latvia in 1940.
   According to the radio report, monitored by the BBC in London,
Rubiks said the congress and ``other anti-socialist organizations
and their leaders are heedless of the tragic consequences of such a
step for the fate of the peoples of Latvia. They are heading for an
overthrow of the existing state system.''

   Eastern Europe ignored violenceelsewhere
and quietly celebrated its freedom from decades of stagnant
Communist ritual on May Day, substituting music fests and picnics
for the proletarian parades of the past.
   Turbulence marked May Day demonstrations in South Korea, West
Berlin, Mexico, Turkey and the Philippines, however.
   And in Moscow, a brief burst of the popular rage that has swept
hard-line Communists from power across Eastern Europe erupted in
Red Square Tuesday, where the traditional parade was open to all
for the first time in decades.
   Taunting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top
leaders with cries of ``Shame!'' demonstrators waved Lithuanian
flags and banners bearing fierce anti-Kremlin slogans.
   With their Stalinist leaders already overthrown, thanks in part
to Gorbachev's reforms, East Europeans rejoiced more peacefully,
marking May Day as they wished.
   In Leipzig, East Germany, however, leftist youths brawled with
young neo-Nazis in the market square, the government news agency
ADN reported.
   West Berlin suffered an annual surge of May Day violence as
bands of mostly leftist radicals hurled firebombs and rocks Tuesday
night and police responded with tear gas and truncheons. More than
50 people were arrested, police said.
   But the common traditions of Western and Eastern Europe also
found symbolic expression in May Day celebrations in West Berlin as
60,000 Germans, including thousands of East Berliners, came through
the Brandenburg Gate.
   Stormy street protests broke out in Seoul, South Korea's
capital, and at least 17 provincial cities on the labor holiday.
Tens of thousands of students and workers at auto plants, subways,
shipyards and broadcast stations held rallies or clashed with
police.
   The protests were over police raids that crushed strikes at a
state broadcast network and South Korea's largest shipyard.
   Citizens in Nepal for the first time celebrated May Day legally,
in keeping with the democratic reforms implemented last month by
King Birendra.
   Workers in Mozambique marched through downtown Maputo demanding
higher wages and lower prices and celebrating their first May Day
since the ruling party dropped its Marxist philosophy.
   And in Santiago, Chile, President Patricio Aylwin marked the
nation's first May Day in democracy in 17 years, asking workers for
patience in their economic demands and announcing changes in
restrictive labor laws issued by the previous military regime.
   In Mexico City, riot police on horseback and on foot charged a
holiday march of independent unions, swinging clubs and leaving
several demonstrators bleeding from head wounds. Rocks and bricks
were hurled at police in reply.
   The marchers reached the main plaza as a larger demonstration by
pro-government unions was dispersing.
   About 40,000 demonstrators attended a rally in Buenos Aires,
cheering leftist leaders who denounced Peronist President Carlos
Menem's bills to restrict the right to strike and to regulate
employment.
   The government's economic program is ``anti-people,'' Vicente
said, and ``dictated by the International Monetary Fund.''
   Pro-Sandinista labor groups threw chunks of concrete at a May
Day demonstration by a rival organization in Managua, Nicaragua,
injuring at least one demonstrator and leading to arrests.
   About 40,000 marchers in San Salvador, capital of El Salvador,
demanded serious talks between the government and leftist
guerrillas.
   Istanbul Gov. Cahit Bayar said police detained 1,048 people
trying to hold illegal May Day celebrations. Nine people were
wounded in clashes, officials said.
   Turkish news agencies said other demonstrators were detained
throughout Turkey, where May Day celebrations were banned in 1980.
   In the Philippines, troops beat dozens of protesters outside a
U.S.-run air base and clashed with demonstrators elsewhere in
rallies nationwide to demand removal of U.S. military bases. Scores
were reported injured.
   Thousands of Hungarians turned out for a trade union picnic in a
Budapest park. The once all-powerful Communists, soundly defeated
in last month's polls, were reduced to running a single beer stand.
   In Prague, American poet Allen Ginsberg received a raucous
welcome 25 years after he was crowned ``King'' of a student
festival but then expelled by the Communists.
   Ginsberg warned a nationally televised rock and folk fest
against blind imitation of the West as Czechoslovakia returns to
democracy.
   Romanians, demanding the resignation of interim President Ion
Iliescu because of his Communist past, continued a 10-day-old
protest in Bucharest. At least 1,000 anti-Iliescu protesters
gathered in a second city, Timisoara.
   In Warsaw, Poland, 200 supporters of a leftist, anti-Communist
group marched to protest the Solidarity-led government's austerity
policies.
   The May Day holiday has deep popular roots across much of
Eastern Europe, where Socialist traditions predate Stalinism. May
Day is a traditional spring festival.
   ``The meaning of May Day changed in step with history,'' Polish
President Wojciech Jaruzelski said.
   In France, both the far-right and unionists marched in separate
rallies to celebrate the holiday.
   The only East European capitals where the once all-powerful
Communists staged rallies were Sofia, Prague and Tirana, Albania.
   Albania's state news agency ATA quoted Communist leader Ramiz
Alia as reiterating the refusal of his nation _ Europe's last
bastion of Stalinism _ to follow Eastern European reforms. ``They
are heading into a blind alley,'' he reportedly told a workers'
rally, ``jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.''
   In China, a holiday mood prevailed.
   But an armed police cordon around the monument to revolutionary
heroes in Beijing's Tiananmen Square emphasized official
determination to avoid any repeat of the pro-democracy
demonstrations, which spread last spring from the monument to much
of the country before being brutally suppressed in June.

<HEAD>U.S. Urged to Help `Keep the Lights Burning' in Hong Kong</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States needs a policy to help
``keep the lights burning'' in Hong Kong because Chinese leaders
want firm control over the city rather than prosperity when they
take over from Britain, outspoken Hong Kong legislator Martin Lee
said Tuesday.
   When Chinese leaders feel insecure, as now, ``they want to
control the country first, and likewise to control Hong Kong ... so
the economy becomes of secondary importance,'' he said in a speech
at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy research and
advocacy group.
   Lee, a member of the Hong Kong legislative council, has been
giving a pessimistic forecast on Hong Kong's future at meetings
with U.S. government officials and members of Congress and in
lecture and television appearances.
   Britain and China in 1984 agreed that the British colony will
rejoin China in 1997, when Britain's lease expires, but retain its
private enterprise economy and certain other autonomy for at least
50 years.
   With British influence waning and emigration from the colony
swelling, ``there needs to be a U.S. policy'' upholding democracy,
human and economic freedoms for Hong Kong, he said.
   ``If you allow the lights to be switched off in 1997, I'm afraid
it will affect not only Hong Kong and China but also the Pacific
Rim,'' he said. ``It would be better for the free world to keep
this international city afloat, to keep the heart beating in Hong
Kong well beyond 1997, rather than being faced with having to take
our people as refugees, because that is a distinct possibility.''
   The Chinese democracy movement, crushed last June, and the
collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe have prompted grave
concern by the Chinese leadership for its own security, already
reflected in a hard-line stand in framing the post-1997 basic law
for Hong Kong recently approved in Beijing, he said.
   ``China is quite happy to see Hong Kong being an outlet for her
products and a window to the free world where she can convert her
currency,'' he said, but in Beijing's view, ``that's good enough _
Hong Kong need not be such an important place'' as today, when it
ranks as the world's 11th largest trading entity.
   In the view of the Chinese leadership, ``If Hong Kong should
lose its prosperity it doesn't matter provided it doesn't pose a
threat,'' said Lee.

<TEXT>
   America still loves Lucy _ particularly the
pilot for what became CBS' classic ``I Love Lucy'' series. No
matter that the show was made during the Korean war, when Harry S.
Truman was president.
   By a CBS estimate, 40 million viewers saw ``I Love Lucy: The
Very First Show,'' a Monday special featuring the 34-minute pilot,
which Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz filmed in black and white at
their own expense on March 10, 1951. Despite the years, it was the
first time the show had been broadcast.
   The one-hour CBS special easily trounced its modern network
rivals in the ratings, according to national Nielsen estimates
Tuesday. It had a 21.2 rating and got 37 percent of the audience in
its time period.
   In contrast, NBC's ``Shannon's Deal'' got a 10.7 rating and a 19
percent share of the audience. ABC's ``Capital News'' was a distant
third, averaging only a 4.8 rating and a minuscule 8 percent share
of the audience.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   The special was hosted by Lucie Arnaz, the daughter of early
television's most famous couple.
   Monday's CBS special was the premiere of the ``I Love Lucy''
pilot, made on kinescope when Ball, who died last year, was five
months pregnant with her daughter.
   Produced by Ball and her husband for $5,000, the show was never
broadcast. CBS preferred a different version, which it used as the
basis for its first 26-show order for the series.
   The pilot, once thought to have been lost, was rediscovered last
year by former CBS Entertainment president Bud Grant, now an
independent producer.
   He found that a copy of it was in the posession of Joanne Perez,
the widow of a vaudeville performer, Pepito the Spanish Clown, who
appears in the show. Grant worked out the deal for the pilot to be
shown as a CBS special.
   ``I Love Lucy'' ran on CBS from 1951 to 1961. Arnaz and Ball
were divorced in 1960. The Cuban bandleader, credited with
pioneering the use of three cameras and live studio audiences in
making TV sitcoms, died in 1986.

<HEAD>Amnesty Alleges Torture Of Political Prisoners In Burma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Torture of civilians by Burma's security forces is
widespread and anyone criticizing or even suspected of opposing the
military government is at risk, Amnesty International said
Wednesday.
   The worldwide human rights organization said it had new evidence
from recently released political prisoners, refugees and other
sources that torture thought to have been limited to areas of armed
ethnic conflict is rife throughout the country.
   In its May newsletter, Amnesty International said at least six
military and civilian security agencies operating in more than a
dozen centers have been routinely torturing detainees for two years.
   ``The security forces seem to have almost unrestricted authority
to carry out arbitrary arrests, to detain prisoners incommunicado
for months without charge or trial and to interrogate them using
torture,'' Amnesty International said.
   It said thousands of people have been killed in pro-democracy
demonstrations and, following the September 1988 military coup,
thousands more were arrested for non-violent political activities.
   Burmese authorities have not responded to repeated requests by
Amnesty International to visit the country to discuss its concerns,
the organization said.
   Amnesty International said the torture usually takes place early
in a prisoner's period of detention during the initial questioning.
Prisoners often do not have any contact with relatives or lawyers
for weeks or months, by which time their injuries may have healed,
it said. Even then, prisoners may not be authorized to see their
visitors privately and therefore cannot openly describe their
treatment, it said.
   Victims have ranged from young students to prisoners over 80
years old, it said. Beatings are the most frequent form of torture,
including punching, kicking, and blows with wooden sticks or
truncheons, it said.
   Amnesty International renewed its previous calls for an inquiry
into reports that security forces deliberately killed several
thousand demonstrators as the pro-democracy movement gathered
momentum between March and September 1988 and after the coup.

   Gov. Mike Sullivan said Tuesday he's
averted the ``doom and gloom'' scenarios predicted four years ago
and wants another term as the state's chief executive to heal
Wyoming's ailing economy.
   The Democrat's re-election announcement was long anticipated,
yet until Tuesday he overlooked charges from Republican
gubernatorial candidate Mary Mead that he lacked the leadership to
pull the state out of its economic quagmire.
   ``The record speaks to that,'' Sullivan said in answer to a
reporter's question on how he would defend himself from Mead's
attacks. ``Leadership in any race always seems to be what is
grabbed on and run with.''
   The governor, who is expected to face only token opposition in
the Aug. 21 primary, said he expects Mead to challenge his
statements that the economy has improved.
   In making his re-election announcement, Sullivan said economic
progress has been made, if for no other reason than that the
economy hasn't been the ``economic wasteland'' some predicted.
   ``There is no question that we've made sacrifices, that it's
been a lot of hard work, and it's been difficult times in
Wyoming,'' Sullivan told a crowd of supporters who gathered in his
office to hear his announcement.
   ``But some of the dire predictions, the doom and gloom that was
predicted four years ago, has been averted,'' he said. ``By hard
work, by sacrifice in a lot of areas ... There is progress being
made. It shows in the real numbers, it shows in the attitudes as
you go throughout the state.''

   A federal judge Tuesday night halted the
scheduled execution of two-time killer Bobby Lewis Shaw, a few
hours after the U. S. Supreme Court declined to intervene in the
case.
   Shaw had been scheduled to die by injection at 12:01 a.m.
Wednesday at Potosi Correctional Center.
   However, U.S. District Judge Edward L. Filippine issued a stay
at the request of Shaw's lawyer, Don Wolff. The judge said Wolff's
petition contained 12 grounds for relief and that he needed time to
review the issues.
   ``Given the unique circumstances surrounding the filing of this
petition, the nature of the issues raised and the volume of the
material that must be reviewed, a stay of execution is necessary,''
he said.
   The nation's highest court earlier voted 5-4 against stopping
the execution.
   On Tuesday afternoon, the Missouri Coalition Against the Death
Penalty asked Gov. John Ashcroft to give Shaw a reprieve ``because
the prisoner does not comprehend the charges against him,'' said
the group's spokeswoman, Martha Schieber.
   ``It's in the interest of the common good that no death penalty
be imposed on a person that suffers from a mental disease or
defect,'' Ms. Schieber said. ``There is evidence that Mr. Shaw
suffers from a mental disease or defect.''
   Ashcroft's spokesman, Bob Ferguson, said his boss referred the
application for a reprieve to the state parole board. Ashcroft
supports capital punishment and has not previously stopped an
execution.
   Wolff said a psychiatrist and a psychologist who examined Shaw
at the Potosi Correctional Center on Monday agreed that the
38-year-old St. Louis man ``suffers from mental disease or
defect.'' They found Shaw suffers from dementia, memory loss and
doesn't understand the penalty he faces or the arguments in his
case, the attorney said.
   Wolff had prepared briefs for state and federal courts
incorporating the psychological findings and other arguments.
   ``I am so busy I haven't had time to be optimistic or
pessimistic,'' Wolff said.
   Shaw would have been the 124th person executed since the 1976
U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume carrying out
the death penalty.
   Missouri has executed two people since that ruling. Sixty-nine
other men and two women are under death sentence in Missouri.
   Elsewhere, an execution in Florida scheduled for Wednesday was
delayed for a man convicted of the 1976 slaying of a Florida
Highway Patrol trooper and a Canadian constable. U.S. District
Judge Lenore Nesbitt on Tuesday issued a 48-hour stay for Jessie
Joseph Tafero, 43. The governor's office immediately rescheduled
the execution for 7:01 a.m. Friday.
   Shaw had no visitors scheduled Tuesday, and he had not asked for
any family or friends to serve as witnesses to the execution,
prison spokesman Dale Riley said.
   ``He is very quiet, almost what I would call a flat
personality,'' Riley said. ``He hasn't made any real expressions at
all, no statements for public release.''
   Lawyers have argued that Shaw has an IQ of 73 and has spent most
of his adult life behind bars. ``He has a history of borderline
intellectual functioning,'' Wolff said.
   But courts ruled Shaw was fit to stand trial for the July 16,
1979, stabbing death of Walter Farrow, 61, a guard at the Missouri
State Penitentiary in Jefferson City. During the attack on Farrow
with two butcher knives, Shaw injured a second prison employee.
   He was already serving a life sentence for the 1975 murder of a
man who had been his sister's boyfriend.

<HEAD>New Arrested in Iraqi `Super Gun' Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customs agents investigating the development of a
suspected ``super gun'' for Iraq made further arrests Tuesday,
British Customs officials said.
   Two British companies involved in the investigation, Sheffield
Forgemasters Ltd. and Walter Somers Ltd., both confirmed that
employes had been picked up for questioning.
   The questioning and arrests sparked an outcry in the House of
Commons by lawmakers from all parties and there were several calls
for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government to
make a statement.
   A Customs Office spokesman, who spoke on condition he was not
identified, said the arrests took place in northern England but
refused to identify those arrested or to say how many people were
detained. Government sources said four people were arrested.
   In the House of Commons, opposition Labor Party lawmaker Richard
Caborn said he understood 14 people from Forgemasters and Walter
Somers were taken in for questioning, three were arrested and six
other Forgemasters executives were in police stations giving
statements.
   Conservative lawmaker Sir Hal Miller said he had been told that
Peter Mitchell, managing director of Walter Somers, had been
arrested and initially denied access to a lawyer until his wife
intervened. ``I should like a government minister to make a
statement on how this comes to pass,'' he said.
   Eight giant tubes manufactured by Sheffield Forgemasters were
seized by British Customs officers on April 12 at the port of
Middlesbrough and military experts later said they could be used as
the barrel of a giant gun.
   The Iraqi government and the company have said they were
intended for a petrochemical plant. The company has said it had
government permission to sell the pipes to Iraq.
   Trucks heading for Iraq with steel forgings from Walter Somers
were stopped in Turkey and Greece late last month, and Greek
authorities arrested the British driver.
   Caborn said the contracts they were being questioned about
``were cleared by the Department of Trade and Industry'' and
demanded the government answer a series of questions about the
affair.
   Miller said he had evidence supporting both firms' claims of
being innocent in the affair.
   A week before the April 12 seizure of the steel tubes, Iraq
placed an urgent order with Walter Somers for a component that the
company fears may have been an aiming device. The order was refused.
   Britain imposed an arms embargo on Iran and Iraq during their
eight-year war and has not lifted it because no formal cease-fire
has been signed.
   Customs officers have said the tubes built by Sheffield
Forgemasters could be assembled to make a 131-foot long gun barrel
with a 39-inch bore.
   The company has said that 44 sections of tubing have already
been delivered to Iraq, and there has been speculation that an even
longer barrel may have been intended.

<HEAD>Official: Law Could Cause Embargoes on Shrimp Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Current law aimed at protecting endangered sea
turtles could cause widespread embargoes of imported shrimp next
year, a Bush administration official told Congress Tuesday.
   The law approved last year forbidding shrimp imports after 1991
from countries that are lax about turtle protection may be
unrealistic, said Edward E. Wolfe, deputy assistant secretary of
state for oceans and fisheries affairs.
   ``There is little chance that these countries will be able to
meet the standards required by the law in the time allowed, no
matter how genuine the effort,'' said Wolfe in testimony before the
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the
environment of the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries.
   Wolfe told the panel ``widespread embargoes may be inevitable''
without an extension of the May 1, 1991, deadline requiring foreign
countries to be as tough on shrimpers as the United States.
   Panama, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica are sure to be
affected by such an embargo, Wolfe said.
   ``It has long been the bipartisan policy of the United States
... to support efforts aimed at promoting economic development and
political stability in Central America,'' he said.
   ``Now, when the region will be looking more than ever to the
United States to support its democratic efforts, we are preparing
to impose trade sanctions totaling more than $115 million for these
four countries alone.''
   Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela likely would be hit by an embargo
also, Wolfe said.
   But shrimpers support such action against countries that do not
have strict conservation laws, said Harris Lasseigne, president of
the Texas Shrimp Association.
   Imported shrimp worth $1.7 billion accounted for more than 75
percent of all shrimp consumed in the United States in 1988, Wolfe
said. The largest suppliers are Mexico, China and Ecuador.
   Lasseigne said imported shrimp are a ``severe problem'' for U.S.
shrimpers.
   ``Dumping of foreign shrimp into the U.S. market directly
affects the price the American producer receives for his product,''
Lasseigne said. ``The U.S. producer is forced to compete with much
lower operating costs in foreign countries.''
   Lasseigne and other shrimpers called for a loosening in
regulations that require the use of turtle excluder devices in
their nets, which they say cause them to lose up to 70 percent of
their catch.
   Last year, the enforcement of regulations requiring those
devices prompted shrimpers to blockade ports in Texas and other
states.

<HEAD>Testimony Reveals Attempts to Get Money From Elderly Millionaire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Playboy model charged with tax evasion
discussed a staged kidnapping and palimony suit as ways to elicit
money from the elderly millionaire who paid her expenses and gave
her gifts, a witness said Tuesday.
   William G. Domer was the first prosecution witness to testify in
the federal trial of Lynnette Harris, 35, who is charged with
failing to pay taxes on more than $1 million she and her twin
sister reputedly received for sex from David Kritzik, who died last
year at age 89.
   Domer, a former accountant, testified under examination by U.S.
Attorney Mel Johnson that he first met Ms. Harris when she
consulted him about her taxes in February 1985.
   He said she was concerned about not having filed returns for
several years and about $130,000 she had received from Kritzik.
   During the 1{ years Ms. Harris retained Domer as a financial
consultant, she inflated expense bills she reported to Kritzik and
discussed other ways to get money _ including staging a kidnapping
with Al Hoffman, a weightlifter with whom she had an affair, Domer
testified.
   ``There was one discussion that there was a remark made about
having her kidnapped by Mr. Hoffman ... to be held for ransom,''
Domer said.
   Also Ms. Harris ``talked about suing Mr. Kritzik for a large
amount of money using a palimony suit as a means of doing that,''
he said.
   Ms. Harris, a former actress and model, faces two counts of tax
evasion and two counts of failure to file income tax returns. The
charges carry a maximum penalty of 12 years in prison and $625,000
in fines.
   Her identical twin, Leigh Ann Conley, of Milwaukee, is charged
with four counts of failing to file federal income tax returns in
the same alleged scheme. She will stand trial in June.
   The blonde twins have appeared nude in Playboy and two films.
   Kritzik of Shorewood founded General Merchandise Co. in the
1930s, which grew to become one of the largest mail order companies
in the world. He later created the Treasure Island discount store
chain, which was sold to J.C. Penny Co. for $11 million.
   Defense attorney Dennis Coffey maintains the money Ms. Harris
received was a gift and therefore not taxable.
   A second prosecution witness, John Ebert, testified he was hired
by Ms. Harris in late 1984 or early 1985 as a general contractor on
a project to remodel a house she owned in East Troy. He said he
received $51,000 in payments from Kritzik.
   Ebert was asked about Ms. Harris' relationship with Kritzik.
   ``What did she say her occupation was?'' Johnson asked.
   ``More or less a prostitute,'' Ebert said. ``She said it in a
roundabout way.''
   Julie Drigot, who worked as a housekeeper for Kritzik from 1977
until his death, testified Ms. Harris told her she viewed her
sexual relationship with Kritzik as a job and didn't enjoy contact
with him.
   In other testimony Tuesday, Milton Sattell, Kritzik's accountant
of 25 years, said he had prepared gift tax returns for money
Kritzik gave Ms. Conley between 1982 and 1986, but none for money
given to Ms. Harris.
   Thomas Walz, a special agent with the Internal Revenue Service's
criminal investigation unit, testified as the government's chief
investigator of Ms. Harris' case.
   He cited documents he said indicated Ms. Harris had an ``express
oral agreement'' with Kritzik to pay her in exchange for
``cohabitating'' with him.
   ``He was 84 years old, there wasn't a whole lot of sex,'' Walz
said, reading Ms. Harris' statements from the deposition. ``Sex
wasn't a major portion of the relationship.''

<HEAD>Bush Sends Overhaul Proposal to Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush sent Congress legislation
Tuesday to overhaul the federal civil service pay system.
   If enacted, the Bush initiative would scrap the current
``General Schedule'' of pay scales and erect a new, two-tier pay
system for professional and clerical jobs.
   It would install a new, higher pay scale for the professionals
and others in hard-to-fill administrative posts, and allow the
government to vary pay for clerical jobs by the prevailing wages in
different regions.
   It would eliminate automatic ``step'' increases for the
professionals and top administrators, substituting instead pay
increases on merit.
   The Office of Personnel Management planned to release full
details of the pay plan at a news briefing Wednesday.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a written
statement the proposal ``will provide several interim measures to
address the most serious recruitment and retention problems and
then, over the next several years, will initiate broader reforms of
the pay-setting machinery.''
   Fitzwater said, ``These changes will help make the system more
flexible in responding to the labor market and will strengthen the
ties between pay and performance.''

   President Bush paid tribute Tuesday night to
Korean War veterans, saying their fight ``laid the foundation for
the march of democracy'' around the world today.
   Bush delivered the speech before a black-tie audience of 550 at
a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for the Korean War Veterans
Memorial.
   ``It was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for
the first time, in a victory regretably sometimes ignored by
history,'' Bush said of the conflict that claimed 54,246 American
lives.
   Bush said that a Korean War Memorial planned for the Mall in
Washington will help ensure that Korea does not remain ``the
forgotten conflict.''
   ``America must remember that struggle, from the Pusan perimeter
to the landing at Inchon to the recapture and brave defense of
Seoul,'' said the president.
   ``Looking back at the Korean conflict, our defense of freedom
laid the foundation for the march of democracy we're seeing today
around the world,'' Bush said.
   The dinner included a salute to the five senators and 18 members
of House who fought in Korea. Bush said, ``Because of these brave
soldiers and so many others, South Korea is now on its way to
becoming one of the world's economic powers, with a freely elected
democratic government and secure borders.''
   Several South Korean industrialists made major contributions to
the fund to build the $10.5 million memorial, including Lee Kun
Hee, chairman of the Samsung Group, who was singled out by Bush for
his sponsorship of the dinner.
   Other major contributors included Hyundai Motor America, IBM and
the AFL-CIO.
   Congress authorized the memorial in 1986, and the organizers
have until October 1991 to raise the funds and commence work. The
dinner was expected to net about $300,000 and boost the total
raised to date to $6 million.
   Bush left after his speech without staying for dinner or to hear
comedian Bob Hope.
   Bush unveiled the winning design for the Korean War Memorial
last June 14 in a Rose Garden ceremony.
   The memorial, which will rise near the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial, will consist of 38 life-size statues of combat troops
moving down a path toward the U.S. flag. It will not have the names
of each serviceman killed in the conflict.

<HEAD>President Says Capitalism Remedy for Argentina's Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED MCCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem of the
Peronist party, which for decades advocated a blend of capitalism
and socialism, said Tuesday that capitalism is the only solution to
Argentina's economic problems.
   His comments came as 40,000 May Day demonstrators rallied and
cheers leftist leaders who denounced Menem's recent bills to
restrict the right to strike and to regulate employment.
   In opening a session of Congress, Menem said: ``We hope to
construct capitalism that is humanized. Decent. Efficient.
Competitive.''
   Menem's open support of capitalism was his clearest break with
his party's traditional support of state control of industry.
   He argues he has no choice. Argentina is beset by triple digit
inflation and more than 30 percent unemployment. The national
currency, the austral, has lost nearly all of its value against the
dollar in recent months and foreign aid was unobtainable.
   Menem, 59, was elected in May 1988 promising pay raises for
workers and a ``productive revolution'' that would spur employment
and economic growth.
   But since taking office in July, Menem has presided over budget
cuts, layoffs, the lifting of controls on prices and foreign
exchange, the partial deregulation of the oil industry, and the
pending sale of state companies.
   ``Let no one be mistaken,'' Menem told the senators and deputies
gathered under the immense stained-glass dome of the Congress.
   ``The transformation of the state, the sale of public companies,
the elimination of regulations ... (And) the cleaning up of fiscal
accounts ... Are necessary to recover the sovereignty of our
state.''
   Applause was modest.
   Menem's proposals are radical in a nation where one-quarter of
all workers are public employees. Historically, wages and prices
were controlled, imports restricted, foreign investment discouraged
and domestic investment subsidized. Tax evasion was widespread.
   Virtually every government since that of party founder Juan
Peron in the 1946 had supported government regulations and control
of industries. Peron nationalized major industries and created
state enterprises, but also permitted private businesess to operate.
   Since the 1940s, Argentina has fallen from being one of the
world's richest nations to an economic nightmare.
   At a rally on the city's broad Avenida de Mayo, the Communist
Party and other leftist groups rallied to celebrate Labor Day, a
national holiday, and comdemn Menem.
   ``Down with the economic plan of Menem and the International
Monetary Fund,'' read one banner.
   Thousands cheers Nestor Vicente of the United Left coalition
when he called Menem's economic plan, ``anti-people.''

<HEAD>Israel Concerned Over Friction With U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials expressed concern Tuesday over
Israel's growing friction with the United States, which stems from
disagreements over Middle East peace policy, Jewish settlements in
the occupied lands and U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   Referring to the State Department's sharp criticism of Israel
for rejecting U.S. proposals for a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue,
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said, ``It has to worry me, and it has
to worry all of us.''
   On Monday, the State Department accused right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir of missing an important opportunity for
peace by refusing to agree to U.S. terms for talks with
Palestinians in Cairo.
   The Shamir government rejected the talks, saying they could lead
to backdoor negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Adding to the strain is Washington's pressure on Israel to stop
building Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip and to free Shiite Moslem prisoners to help win the release
of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.
   Israel has resisted both demands and Shamir's caretaker
government has even stepped up settlement construction in recent
weeks.
   The Haaretz daily reported Tuesday that Shamir agreed to push
plans to create settlements approved by previous governments and
listed 14 sites under consideration. The U.S. has repeatedly said
that settlements are an obstacle to peace.
   President Bush made an indirect appeal for a prisoner release,
saying he ``certainly had no objection'' if Israel made such a move
as a goodwill gesture.
   But Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said Israel had not received any
request for a prisoner release and said the United States was
``certainly not'' pressuring Israel over the issue.
   He stressed that Israel was seeking the release of three Israeli
servicemen held by radical Shiite Moslems in Lebanon.
   But Pazner and other officials gave no indication that Israel
would free abducted pro-Iranian Shiite cleric Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid or about 300 Arabs, most Lebanese Shiites, held by an
Israeli-backed militia in south Lebanon to encourage the release of
U.S. hostages.
   Shamir is now trying to form a right-wing coalition government
without the center-left Labor Party. Labor collapsed the joint
Labor-Likud government in March when Shamir refused to endorse U.S.
peace proposals.
   Arens, a close Shamir ally, said Tuesday that Shamir would stick
to a peace initiative adopted by the Likud-Labor coalition in May
1988.
   ``You will find that in the policy guidelines (of the new
government) it will be written that we have to advance the peace
program of May 1988. And it will be advanced,'' Arens said in an
interview with Israel television.
   The government peace program calls for Palestinian elections and
limited autonomy in the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Defense Chief Says U.S. Troops Needed for Influence in Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will suffer a sharp loss of
influence in Europe if it withdraws its troops from the continent,
West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said Tuesday night.
   Nuclear forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should
remain in Germany and elsewhere in Europe, but that their numbers
should be greatly reduced, he said.
   All nuclear weapons in West Germany belong to and are controlled
by the United States, though France and Britain have nuclear-armed
forces elsewhere.
   NATO officials might move toward replacing ground-based nuclear
weapons with air-launched missiles when they meet next week in
Canada, he said in a speech to the American Institute for
Contemporary German Studies of the Johns Hopkins University.
   Stoltenberg rejected Soviet opposition to a unified Germany
remaining in NATO and said he saw hope that the Soviet Union would
agree to it.
   He said it was conceivable for NATO troops to be restricted to
what is now West Germany after unification and that other German
forces not assigned to NATO could then be present in what is now in
East Germany.
   ``It gives me great satisfaction to add that the foreign
ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary supported this
position at the latest meeting of the Warsaw Pact foreign
ministers,'' Stoltenberg said. Their support might help persuade
Moscow to accept German membership in NATO, he added.
   Stoltenberg said the United States might be able to reduce its
forces on the central European front beyond the 195,000 troops
proposed by President Bush, but Americans should maintain a
substantial military presence in Europe, he said.
   ``In the past American cooperation and influence on European
policy was helpful and in future American policy and influence in
Europe can be helpful,'' Stoltenberg said.
   ``But without any soldiers or significant (numbers of) soldiers,
your influence in all matters of security policy will sharply
decline,'' he added. ``And I doubt whether this is desirable.''
   Stoltenberg laughed at a suggestion that the American dominance
of the security structure of NATO was an infringement on German
sovereignty and thus was comforting to France.
   ``To avoid war between Germany and France we don't need NATO,''
he said.

<HEAD>ANC Natal Leader Talks of Firing Squads</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIETERMARITZBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A provincial leader of the
African National Congress said Tuesday that police and members of
white right-wing organizations would face firing squads or
imprisonment when the ANC takes power, the South African Press
Association reported.
   The independent news agency quoted Harry Gwala, of Natal
province, as also saying, ``Those vast tracts of land that are
currently owned by white farmers should be returned to those who
own it and are living on it.''
   In one of the most militant speeches by any ANC leader since the
organization was legalized in February, Gwala was quoted as warning
``warlords, hit squad members, AWB (Afrikaner Resistance Movement)
members and police'':
   ``When we are free, our prison doors will be open for you.
   ``If you are lucky, you will end up serving long prison
sentences, but for the hardened criminals ... the only place for
them is in front of the firing squad.''
   He gave a May Day speech to a crowd of about 10,000 in Edendale,
in the heart of Natal. More than 500 Zulus have died in the
province this year, mostly from battles between supporters of the
ANC and members of Inkatha, a political party headed by Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   More than 10,000 people, mostly ANC supporters, became refugees
in Edendale and hundreds of people on both sides died in fighting
since February.
   He urged the gathering to defend their homes and families
against Inkatha. ``Let us wipe them out if they attack us,'' Gwala
was quoted as saying. He also asked removal of all police and
soldiers sent to quell the violence.
   Gwala attacked South Africa's commercial press in his speech,
and promised that an ANC government would subsidize education and
provide schoolchildren with free breakfast and lunch.
   Gwala spoke on the eve of talks between the government and ANC
leaders attempting to eliminate obstacles to formal constitutional
negotiations. The government says continuing violence and ANC calls
for armed struggle hinder the negotiation process.
   ``While the government continues to harass our people, the armed
struggle will continue,'' Gwala was quoted as saying. ``If it
arises that the future of our country can be settled peacefully, we
will negotiate with the government. But if the negotiations break
down, F.W. de Klerk's government must not be deceived, we will
continue the struggle in all ways.''

and at least 209 others were tortured, detained or harassed because
they advocated justice.
   ``The lawyers and judges with whom this report is concerned
stand as symbols of the struggle for justice and human rights,''
said committee Chairman Marvin E. Frankel.
   The report chronicled abuses against lawyers, judges, law
students and law professors in 48 countries.
   It did not include Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Albania, North Korea and
other countries where lawyers and judges do not or cannot challenge
abuses committed by governments or security forces, the committee
said.
   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights is a 12-year-old
organization based in New York. Its data was gathered by a
worldwide network of lawyers, which shares information and appeals
to authorities in certain cases.
   Colombia headed the list with 58 abuses, one-fourth of the total
cases reported.
   The committee said the abuses included the killings of 17
lawyers and 10 judges in 1989. More than 225 judges, magistrates
and court workers have been murdered since 1980 in Colombia, where
political and drug-related violence is commonplace.
   ``In countries like Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, the
Philippines and Sri Lanka, among others, the threats to the due
process of law, and to the professionals devoted to administering
the process, come from a frightening array of diverse forces,'' the
report said.
   Twelve legal professionals were killed in Peru last year,
including Marcial Capelleti Cisneros, a professor and former
president of the Committee for the Defense of Human Rights.
Cisneros was murdered May 29 while giving a test to law students at
the University of Huamanga.
   The report cited 25 cases of detention, torture and harassment
in Israel, mostly involving Palestinian lawyers who represented
detainees in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In China, seven lawyers and law students were detained. Xiong
Yan, a law student who met with Premier Li Peng to discuss student
demands during the pro-democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square,
was arrested June 14 and charged with organizing and inciting a
counter-revolutionary rebellion.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Agrees to Permit Opposition Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Democratic Party has
asked the government to tolerate the establishment of opposition
parties, a statement read on national television Monday night said.
   The former French colony has been ruled since independence in
1960 by the Democratic Party. The nation's constitution permits
opposition parties, but opposition groups have always had their
requests to form political parties rejected on technical grounds
and their leaders have been harassed.
   The statement said the country had remained a one-party state
because the people preferred such a system. But the communique
added that the government was ``invited to authorize the formation
of new political parties.''
   ``Today, the national consensus on which the Democratic Party's
leadership had been built seems broken ... since some of our
compatriots have demonstrated to show their desire to create their
own parties.'' the statement said.
   The government usually approves party decisions.
   Last week, the government indicated opposition parties would be
tolerated when it said ``anything is possible,'' as long as order
is maintained. Several opposition groups have already applied to
form political parties.
   The government has been under growing pressure to accept
opposition parties since mass student demonstrations in March
protesting austerity measures and following democratic reforms by
several other West African and Central African nations.
   The March riots forced the closing of the nation's schools for
the rest of the year and led to calls for the resignation of
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   The traditional May Day parade was also canceled Tuesday because
of the March demonstrations, said the government newspaper,
Fraternite-Matin.

<HEAD>New Fighting in Chad Leaves 70 Dead, Embassy Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chadian officials said Tuesday that government
forces killed 70 Libyan-backed rebels and took another 45 prisoner
in an attack on a guerrilla refuge.
   The battle Monday came during what the Chadian Embassy to France
described as ``mopping-up operations'' against the Islamic Legion
rebels opposed to the Chadian government.
   A communique released by the embassy made no mention of
government losses. It claimed that the government troops captured
several pickup trucks equipped with rocket launchers.
   The statement did not say where the fighting took place.
   The rebels launch attacks into its territory from bases in the
sparsely populated Darfur province of western Sudan, where the
Khartoum government exercises virtually no control.
   Chad claims the Islamic Legion is armed and trained by Libya.
Tripoli denies the force exists and terms the conflict a purely
Chadian affair.
   In a statement from the official Libyan news agency JANA, Libya
accused Chad of ``hostility'' and said President Hissene Habre
hopes to distract attention from a failing economy by stirring up
war hysteria.
   ``Libya has no connection with the armed confrontation between
Chadians and we have no intention of aggression,'' said the JANA
communique, monitored in Rome. ``We are still hoping for dialogue
and depending on it.''
   The latest round of battles in the sporadic civil war was
touched off in March, when rebels seized two border posts.
   France, the former colonial power, added a company of
paratroopers, an extra transport plane and a medical unit to its
military contingent after the takeover.
   Chadian Foreign Minister Ibn Oumar said in Paris last week that
attempts to negotiate its long-standing territorial dispute with
Libya over the mineral-rich Aouzou Strip have failed.
   The two countries agreed last year to confirm a cease-fire. They
also agreed to exchange prisoners of war and submit the territorial
dispute to international arbitration.

   Ex-hostage Frank Reed said Tuesday he had
been separated from Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland about a
year ago, and was surprised to find out they had not been released,
according to Reed's daughter.
   ``He said he had been with them, but that he hadn't seen Terry
Anderson or Mr. Sutherland for about a year,'' said Marilyn
Langston, 33. ``He was disturbed that they weren't out. He thought
for sure they would have been released.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted on a Beirut street in 1985. Sutherland, acting
agriculture dean at American University of Beirut, was abducted
later that year.
   Reed's wife, Fahima Reed, said her husband was ``very, very
angry'' when he learned that Anderson and Sutherland were still
hostages. Fahima, known as ``Fifi,'' and Reed's 9-year-old son,
Tarek, were reunited Tuesday with Reed in West Germany.
   In an interview from Wiesbaden with television station WHDH of
Boston, Mrs. Reed said of the reunion: ``Nobody spoke a word, we
just hugged each other. Then he started breaking up. He cried. He
broke down and cried.''
   ``We were there to cheer Frank. But Frank was cheering Tarek,
trying to make him laugh, and we ended up laughing, the three of
us.''
   Reed could not sit still and his concentration was erratic, she
said.
   ``That's because he was chained and sitting constantly so he
wanted to move around. I had to keep following him with my eyes,''
she said.
   She said Reed told her: ``I have to be talking because I was
kept for three years, confined by myself, couldn't talk to anybody,
and now I just feel like talking.'' But Reed was able to joke about
some of his experiences.
   ``He has a terrific sense of humor,'' Mrs. Reed said. ``He was
relating some of the stories of things he went through and I just
broke down with laughter. I was laughing like I never laughed in my
life.''
   Langston, Reed's daughter, said he called her early Tuesday from
a military hospital in West Germany.
   ``He said, `Hi dear,' and my heart just started beating fast,''
Langston said. ``It seemed unreal seeing him on television, but
hearing his voice, everything seemed brighter.''
   Langston said her father said he had been blindfolded for much
of his 42 months in captivity, and had lost 60 pounds during the
ordeal.
   ``And he said he hadn't been able to talk for 3{ years,''
Langston said. ``He talked most of the time. He just wanted to
talk. I could barely get a word in edgewise.
   ``But he sounded pretty good, pretty lively, considering what
he's been through,'' she said.
   Monday night, Reed made a brief call to his mother, 91-year-old
Leota Sprague.
   ``He said `hi mom.' I said, `hi Frankie,''' Sprague said. ``I
knew his voice right away. I was thrilled. I said, `it's so good to
hear your voice.'''
   Mrs. Reed and Tarek share an apartment with Sprague. A Malden
native, Reed converted to Islam before marrying his wife. He made
two trips to Lebanon before leaving his post as school principal in
Whitefield, N.H., to become director of elementary education at
Beirut's International College in 1977.
   At the time of his abduction Sept. 9, 1986, Reed was running the
private Lebanese International School, which he founded after the
International College had been bombed out.
   After his abduction, a caller to a Western news agency claimed
he was a CIA spy and was taken by Islamic Jihad, which also is
believed to be holding Anderson and Sutherland. That Shiite
fundamentalist organization denied holding Reed.
   Later, a group calling itself the Organization of Arab
Revolutionary Cells-Omar Mukhtar Brigade claimed responsibility for
Reed's abduction.
   Reed's release came a day after kidnappers issued two statements
saying he would be freed, one signed by the previously unknown
Organization of Islamic Dawn.
   Reed's family called the espionage charge ridiculous.

<HEAD>`Prelude to a Kiss' by Craig Lucas Moves to Broadway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Prelude to a Kiss,'' the bewitching fantasy by
Craig Lucas, has made the journey from off-Broadway to Broadway
with most of the magic intact.
   The big question for the play, which opened Tuesday at the Helen
Hayes Theater, was what would happen to it once leading man Alec
Baldwin left to do a movie and was replaced by Timothy Hutton.
   Well, the verdict is not yet in on Hutton. He undoubtedly will
get better in the role. But right now, the actor is giving a tense
and tentative performance, concentrating more on his lines than on
his character. Once Hutton relaxes, he should do fine. He has a
boyish bewilderment that seems exactly right, considering the odd
but sweet plot.
   The play itself is just as charming as ever, and the rest of the
original cast is even more accomplished than when ``Prelude to a
Kiss'' first opened in March at off-Broadway's Circle Rep.
   The story is a modern New York romance, boy-meets-girl,
boy-loses-girl and then boy-finds-girl _ in the strangest of
circumstances. It starts as a romantic comedy with Peter, played by
Hutton, meeting Rita (Mary-Louise Parker) at a party. They fall in
love, visit her parents in New Jersey and then get married.
   The play builds to the wedding scene where the bride is kissed
by a mysterious old man, played by Barnard Hughes. Suddenly, they
have exchanged souls. Much of the evening's pleasure comes from the
realization that Hughes, in a funny, touching performance, is now
the young woman, and Parker, the elderly gent. And Lucas' dialogue
is unerring, perfectly capturing the cosmic transfer of these two
very different personalities.
   But there is a darkness around the edges of this fairy tale.
Lucas also deals with the transitory nature of life and love,
especially as Peter begins to realize the girl he has married is
not the woman he thought she was. It makes him wonder just what
love is, merely a physical attraction or something more.
   Parker is especially endearing, particularly in the early scenes
when she displays a goofy, off-center sense of comedy. Larry
Bryggman and Debra Monk excel as her understandably worried
parents, and there is an expert comic cameo by John Dossett as the
young man's sardonic best friend.
   Director Norman Rene, a long-time Lucas collaborator, handles
the play with a light, playful touch that never turns preachy. Even
in its more serious moments, ``Prelude to a Kiss'' celebrates the
unexpected nature of romance. It's that sense of adventure that
makes the play such a delight.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Ambassador Alexander Zotov said
Tuesday the Arab-Israeli conflict and the buildup of weapons in the
Middle East would be a ``top priority'' issue at the May 30 to June
3 superpower summit.
   He told reporters, ``The situation in the Middle East is
dramatic. There are many weapons stockpiles of the most destructive
kind, and much violence, too, and something must be done about it.''
   Speaking at a news conference two days after President Hafez
Assad returned from talks in Moscow with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, Zotov reiterated Moscow's support for Syria.
   The threat by Iraq, another Soviet friend, to use chemical
weapons against Israel in the event of an Israeli nuclear attack
has added to tension in a region already bristling with advanced
weapons.
   Zotov said Washington and Moscow have conducted ``very
constructive'' contacts on the subject of peace in the Middle East
prior to the coming talks between President Bush and Gorbachev. He
did not elaborate.
   But he said peace in the region was being held back by ``Israeli
reservations'' to entering into a peace process, and complained
``the United States has not shown enough firmness'' with the
Israelis ``to push matters forward.''
   Zotov stressed Moscow's continuing commitment to bolster Syria's
armed forces but added:
   ``It is the general policy of the Soviet Union to reduce the
level of military conflict everywhere, including the Middle East,
and the emphasis is on a reasonable defensive capability.''
   Assad says Middle East peace is impossible unless Syria achieves
``strategic parity'' with Israel.
   Assad concluded an agreement in Moscow for continuing Soviet
military aid. No details have been divulged.
   Western reports say Moscow has been stressing to Assad that he
abandon his drive for stategic parity with Israel and has reduced
the volume of advanced weapons it traditionally supplied Damascus.
   The London-based Flight International magazine reported last
month that the Kremlin turned down a Syrian request for SA-10 and
SA-11 anti-aircraft missiles. Zotov did not deny this report or
similar ones, but again stressed Moscow's continuing commitment to
Syria's security.
   Analysts estimate that Syria owes the Soviet Union $15 billion.
Soviet officials in Damascus have said the debt is only $4 billion.

   Two men who say they helped Soviet master spy
George Blake break prison in 1966 won a High Court order Tuesday to
delay their trial.
   Lawyers later said they could not recall any recent similar
exercise of the High Court's powers to suspend a criminal trial.
   Judge Sir Derek Hodgson ordered the trial of Patrick Pottle and
Michael Randle halted while their application proceeds for a
judicial review. The trial was to have started at the Old Bailey
central criminal court Wednesday.
   His ruling overturned Judge Sir William Macpherson's decision
Friday at the Old Bailey against granting a permanent suspension of
the trial.
   Pottle, 52, an antiques dealer, and Randle, 56, a researcher,
said it would be ``oppressive'' and ``an abuse of the process of
the court'' to prosecute them for something that happened 24 years
ago.
   Their plea raised an important legal issue as to whether
decisions of crown court judges in such circumstances are open to
judicial review.
   Hodgson said their plea should be considered quickly by the High
Court's Divisional Court. The hearing will be on May 16.
   Blake, now 67 and living in Moscow, was a double agent jailed
for 42 years in 1961. He admitted spying for the Soviets while
working for British intelligence.
   Blake escaped from London's Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1966.
Pacifists Pottle and Randle said in their 1989 book, ``The Blake
Escape,'' that they helped him because of the ``cruel and inhuman
sentence.'' They say authorities knew of their involvement by 1970
but prosecution began only when their book appeared.
   Pottle and Randle are charged with aiding and abetting Blake's
escape, which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison, and
with two conspiracy charges, with a maximum sentence of two years
or an unlimited fine.
   Pottle and Randle said Tuesday they were pleased with Hodgson's
ruling and wanted the case settled.
   ``We don't want it hanging around any longer. It is a bit of a
strain,'' Randle said.

   About 200 inmates briefly refused to return
to their cells Tuesday after an exercise period _ the fourth
straight day of French prison protests.
   A prison official said inmates left the yard after being
threatened with intervention by riot police, who broke up a similar
protest the day before with tear gas.
   Monday's disturbance at the French Riviera prison arose from
demands by 150 inmates for better hygiene and more room. The
prison, built for 280 prisoners, holds 900.
   At the Angers prison in northwestern France, six inmates scaled
rooftops during an exercise break in the prison yard, and 19 others
refused to return to the cell blocks.
   After spelling out their demands for longer exercise periods and
more showers to regional officials, all gave up their protest and
went inside.
   The disturbances began Saturday with a two-day riot by 500
inmates at Loos-Les-Lille prison in the northern industrial city of
Lille, near Belgium.
   On Sunday, at nearby Douai prison, 50 inmates took to the roofs
in sympathy with the Loos-Les-Lille rioters and to demand better
recreational facilities.
   Loos-Les-Lilles was built for 500 prisoners but holds 1,000.

   A Sheridan High School student died of an
apparent self-inflicted wound Tuesday, a day after two of his
classmates apparently took their lives, police said.
   Lt. Lenard Lewis said a student killed himself at his home in
East End, a Saline County community eight miles south of Little
Rock. The body of Jerry Paul McCool, a 17-year-old sophomore, was
found by his father, who called police at 2:28 p.m., Lewis said.
   McCool attended Sheridan High School and knew the two students
who police believe killed themselves Monday.
   Meanwhile, professional counselors joined school officials at
Sheridan High School talking with students affected by the deaths.
About 1,000 parents and students met at the small town high
school's auditorium.
   ``Our community and our school is just in the middle of a
tremendous tragedy that we're all trying to deal with and get a
handle on and improve,'' Superintendent David Robinson said.
   He said classes would go on because routine was important ``when
things begin to crumble. They need something to hang on to.''
   One student killed himself in a classroom Monday and a second
died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot at his home about nine
hours later.
   Thomas Smith, 17, shot himself in a history class after
professing his love for a girl, and Thomas M. Chidester, 19, who
died of a single shot to the head with a .45-caliber weapon late
Monday.
   Chidester was a senior; Smith, a junior. The two took at least
one class together, school officials said.
   Lewis said McCool knew the other boys but was not in any of
their classes. He had spoken with his father about the two youths'
suicide.
   ``His Dad said he said something like, `How could somebody do
that? Why would they do it?' He was asking his Daddy why he would
do that,'' Lewis said.
   McCool stayed home from school Tuesday, complaining about pain
from a hernia operation two weeks ago, Lewis said. The youth was at
school Monday when Smith killed himself but wasn't in the classroom
where the shooting occurred.
   Police say Chidester may have been distraught over Smith's
suicide earlier in the day, Grant County Sheriff Cary Clark said
Tuesday.
   Steve Brown, assistant school superintendent, said the victims
had been friends.
   Chidester ``left a short note saying, `I can't go on any
longer,''' Clark said. The body was sent to the state medical
examiner for autopsy, Clark said.
   Tuesday's death, if officially ruled a suicide, would be the
fourth suicide by high school students in the community of about
3,000, about 25 miles south of Little Rock. Clark said a
17-year-old killed himself about a month ago. Three other suicides
have been committed in the county in the last six weeks, Clark said.
   Sheridan Police Chief David Hooks said Smith was pronounced dead
about four hours after the 1 p.m. shooting.
   ``(Smith) walked to the front of the class and told a girl, `I
love you,''' Hooks said. ``He pulled out a small-caliber revolver
that was in his pants under his shirt and shot one time.''
   The bullet struck him in the forehead.
   He was pronounced dead at Baptist Medical Center in Little Rock.
   Chidester lived with his grandmother, Annie Mae Funderburg. She
told Clark that when she went to bed about 9 p.m., her grandson was
watching television.
   Clark said the woman told him that she awoke early in the
morning and noticed the house lights were still on. She said she
got up and found Chidester sprawled across his bed at an odd angle.
She said she tried to wake him and noticed blood around his head.
   Clark said Grant County Coroner Mike Angelo determined that the
death happened between 10 and 11 p.m. Monday.
   Rhonda Damron, 17, of Sheridan, said she was the girl Smith was
talking about when he went to the front of the fifth-period
American history class.
   ``He said he wanted to say two things about his weekend _ one,
he was in love with me, and ... then he pulled the gun from the
front of his pants and shot himself,'' she said.
   Ms. Damron said she and Smith had been classmates since sixth
grade and became ``very, very close friends'' last year. ``We would
tell each other everything. That was all it was,'' she said.
   Chidester and Smith were members of the school's junior Reserve
Officers Trainer Corps, the sheriff said. Chidester had left school
``for a while'' to attend National Guard training, but returned to
school in September and planned to enter the military after
graduation, Clark said.
   Asked if the two deaths were related, Clark said: ``I have
nothing to confirm that it is or is not. It very possibly could be
by them being friends.''

   First Lady Barbara Bush cuddled
children infected with the AIDS virus and encouraged more community
support for youngsters suffering from the disease.
   Mrs. Bush sat in a rocking chair at Connor's Nursery, the only
nursery for AIDS-infected children in Florida, and played
grandmother, smiling for a child's toy camera and fussing over each
baby.
   ``He doesn't like white hair,'' she joked as one baby started
crying in her arms.
   ``It's important to know that you can love and hug and change
these babies and be spit upon and you can't get AIDS,'' Mrs. Bush
said. ``You can't get AIDS from holding babies. If I didn't know
that before, I learned that from Ryan White.''
   Mrs. Bush attended the funeral of White, the Indiana teen-ager
who died April 8 of acquired immune deficiency syndrome after
getting a tainted blood transfusion.
   Connor's Nursery houses eight babies but has room for 12. The
oldest of the children Mrs. Bush visited Tuesday is 2. Most are
infants.Nursery officials said that less than half of the children,
born addicted to cocaine and testing HIV-positive, were likely to
develop the AIDS virus.

   The General Assembly on Tuesday adopted a
declaration calling on industrialized nations to devote 0.7 percent
of their gross national product to the development of Third World
nations.
   The 106-nation assembly adopted the declaration by concensus to
avoid an open split between Western and developing nations.
   The United States opposes the idea of setting targets for the
amount of aid contributed, and it is was unclear whether many
industrialized nations would abide by the non-binding declaration.
   The declaration is expected to provide general guidelines to
helping underdeveloped nations.
   ``I am grateful for the spirit of harmony and compromise which
made it possible to reach agreement,'' Assembly President Joseph
Garba of Nigeria said in a statement.
   Bolivian Ambassador Hugo Navajas-Mogro, speaking for developing
nations, called the declaration and session, ``landmarks in a new
chapter in the economic history of the United Nations.
   ``This is a message of hope and opportunity for the poorest
sectors of the world, the developing countries, for two-thirds of
mankind.''
   U.S. envoy Edward Marks, senior adviser to the economic session,
told the assembly: ``This declaration represents an important new
step in the way we all look at economic development.''
   But he also said the United States opposes the idea of aid
targets believing that each state should be responsible for their
own development.
   ``The international economic environment, while important, plays
a supporting role,'' Marks said.
   One U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said:
``We feel we should not be forced to give relief. We wish to keep
flexibility in giving debt relief within our broader government
interests.''
   A large proportion of international aid goes toward servicing
developing nation's foreign debt.
   The document calls on industrialized nations to devote 0.7
percent of their gross national product to aiding underdeverloped
countries and 0.15 percent to the least developed countries.
   ``Developed countries should enhance the quantity and quality of
their aid,'' the document says.
   U.S. officials have said that foreign aid is given to further
national policy and insists that the multilateral lending
institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund bear the primary responsibility for aid to the Third World aid.
   The United States has also demanded economic reforms in the
Third World so development aid is not wasted.
   The document says aid to Eastern European nations should not
come at the expense of help to developing nations.
   ``The most important challenge for the 1990s,'' the declaration
says, ``is the revitalization of economic growth and social
development in the develoment countries, which calls for sustained
growth of the world economy and favorable external conditions.''

   Thousands of protesters jeered and booed President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials on Red Square today, using
the traditional May Day workers' march to heap bitter criticism on
the Soviet leadership.
   Columns of unofficial demonstrators, permitted for the first
time in the traditional May Day march through Red Square, unfurled
dozens of yellow red and green Lithuanian national flags, and
shouted ``Shame!'' at Gorbachev and the Soviet leadership standing
atop Lenin's mausoleum.
   Gorbachev and all the officials on the reviewing stand left
about 20 minutes after the unofficial demonstrators began following
the traditional May Day march through Red Square.
   They were booed and jeered as they walked off.

   The government is moving toward resumption of
nuclear weapons production after months of safety-related
shutdowns, despite growing criticism from citizen groups.
   A coalition of citizen groups from communities near nuclear
weapons factories met with Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on
Monday to urge that weapons materials production not be resumed
until environmental studies are completed.
   Watkins indicated he would approve resumption of tritium
production at the Savannah River weapons plant in South Carolina,
and of plutonium triggers at the Rocky Flats plant in Colorado, as
soon as safety and management improvements were finished.
   Tritium and plutonium are key ingredients in virtually all U.S.
nuclear weapons.

   In a rare revision of Mormon ritual, the
church has dropped wording that required women to pledge to obey
their husbands and portrayed the clergy of other religions as
agents of Satan.
   Women must now vow to obey God rather than their husbands in the
``endowment'' ceremony, a ritual the church teaches is necessary to
enable members to live with God after death. The ceremony is
performed only once for each person, but a member may go through it
countless times as a proxy for those who have died.
   The revised ritual, which took effect last month in ceremonies
performed in the 43 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, is being greeted with enthusiasm by church
members who say it reflects greater sensitivity toward women and
other religions.
   ``The temple is an important part of my spiritual life and the
changes have allowed me to go to the temple with renewed joy,''
said Lavina Fielding Anderson, editor-elect of the Journal of
Mormon History.

   Centenarian Henry Stenhouse is running
for Congress after watching the country ``disintegrate'' during his
lifetime.
   ``In some respects you've gotta be a little bit off base to want
to do anything for this country,'' said the 100-year-old eye
doctor, making his first electoral bid. ``But doggone it, God has
saved me for something. I feel like it's an obligation.''
   Early April found the opthalmologist up to his elbows in
correspondence. He was trying to reach all the registered
Republicans in the 3rd Congressional District in time for the May 8
primary against two opponents.
   ``This is the doggonedest thing,'' he said with a sigh. ``I
don't think we'll get it all done. I didn't dream that there was as
many people registered Republicans. We've got pages and pages,
boxes full of them. I don't think we're half through.''

   Weekly box-office figures supplied by movie

count, say insiders, including some who admit to fudging the

   Making movies is more competitive than ever these days, and the
charts that rank them as hot or flops represent free and, some
think, persuasive advertising.
   So why not crunch the numbers extra hard?
   ``It's gotten really out of hand,'' said an executive at one

   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara heads
today for Capitol Hill, where a bill containing $420 million for
his country is inching its way through a tangle of unrelated
amendments in the Senate.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hoped
to complete the supplemental money bill today, which would send it
to a conference with the House to work out differences between
competing versions.
   Endara, who met with President Bush on Monday, planned to confer
today with House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.; members of the
House Foreign Affairs Committee; and with Mitchell and Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Prospects for the bill brightened late Monday when the Senate
accepted by voice vote two provisions that had been road blocks,
dealing with abortions and the death penalty in the District of
Columbia.

   Andy Gustafson wears two wedding rings:
one from his new marriage, one from the marriage that ended in
murder.
   Two and a half years ago, Gustafson, 36, a small-town lawyer,
returned home and found his wife raped and shot to death and his
two children drowned in separate bathtubs.
   A 17-year-old neighborhood youth was arrested two days later and
eventually sentenced to life in prison without parole for the
murders. The teen had apparently been in the house when Mrs.
Gustafson and her son returned home; the daughter was killed when
she came home later.
   ``I was too afraid of going to look for my children because I
was afraid I'd find them dead,'' Gustafson said of that day. ``It
was so shocking and unbelievable. I screamed. I wailed.''
   Except for his moving eulogy at his family's funeral and his
one-day testimony at the murder trial, Gustafson has remained out
of the public eye.
   He has not remained a victim.
   On Jan. 1, 1989, a date chosen to signify a new beginning,
Gustafson remarried. He has known his second wife, Carol, 42, since
they were married to others and both couples attended the Townsend
Congregational Church. Her husband died of a brain tumor in 1984
after 15 years of marriage.
   ``It certainly would have been much more difficult without
her,'' he said, sitting in his book-lined study. ``I don't know
whether I would have made it or not without her. Now I have a
reason to get up in the morning, something to live for.''
   Rather than erase the past, they make a point to remember. Both
wear two wedding bands, their new ones on their left ring fingers
and the others, from their first marriages, on their right hands.
   At their wedding, Carol's first husband's father gave her away.
Andy's dead wife's brother sang. Carol's matron of honor was her
former sister-in-law. They had two ministers with ties to both of
their first spouses.
   ``Your life is about your relationships. When you lose them, you
lose your life in a way,'' Andy said. ``You either get stuck or you
go on and make a new life.''
   They both considered whether they were getting married too soon.
   ``There were a few people in this town that were just aghast,''
said Carol, a warm, petite brunette. ``But when you've gone through
this kind of loss, you're just glad the sun is shining every day.
Life becomes more precious to you. We didn't want to waste it.''
   The couple live in Carol's 10-room, yellow clapboard colonial on
the Townsend Common, the center of a picture-book New England town
about 45 miles northwest of Boston near the New Hampshire state
line.
   The house is three doors from the church where the funeral was
held for the Gustafson family and where he married Carol, and just
a few hundred yards from Hillside Cemetery, where his family is
buried.
   Andy has resumed his law practice just across the Common.
   Starting over has not been easy.
   His life was shattered in the late afternoon of Dec. 1, 1987. He
had just closed a big real estate deal and phoned his wife,
Priscilla, 33, to see if she could get a baby sitter so they could
go out to dinner and celebrate.
   When no one answered the phone, Andy drove the mile to his
family's rustic house, set on an isolated knoll in the woods. He
saw Priscilla's car in the driveway, but the house was eerily dark.
   He found his wife, who was several months pregnant, dead in
their bedroom. She had been sexually assaulted and shot twice in
the head.
   He doesn't remember everything that happened after that. The
trauma was such that he couldn't sleep through the night for six
months.
   He remembers going into the kitchen to call the police and his
parents, too afraid to look for his children because he feared he
would find them dead.
   When the police arrived, Andy sat in one of their cruisers. An
officer came out and told him his daughter, Abigail, 7, and son,
William, 5, had been drowned.
   ``You lose total track of time,'' he said. ``The shock gives you
the adrenaline to get through it at first, but then it wears off.''
   After the murders, Andy stayed with his parents, then rented an
apartment in Townsend. But within a few months he moved back to his
family's home.
   ``I had to emotionally reclaim it,'' he said. ``I had to go back
in there and be all right. The house became a source of strength
for me, with the memories of my family. The love that occurred
there was much stronger than the death there.''
   The first months were difficult, despite dinner invitations from
friends who made sure he would not be alone, Andy said. He joined a
support group for the survivors of homicide victims.
   ``It's a roller coaster with no highs, just different depths,''
he said. ``It's a struggle just to get through each day.
   ``First you sob all the time. Then you set goals. Like you say,
`Today, I'm going to go shopping.' You don't want to go out and
deal with people but then you go ahead and feel better because you
did it.''
   Self pity was not his strong suit.
   ``You always think, `Why me?' But you realize soon enough, `Why
not me?' If you live with your eyes open, you know life isn't
fair.''
   He gravitated to Carol, who understood better than most in their
circle of friends from church what it meant to lose someone.
   From the start, they both said, they've talked out their mutual
grief. Andy, in particular, still has his bad days.
   ``My heart grieves for him,'' Carol said about those times.
``All I can do is hold him and tell him I love him.''
   Andy said the hardest part was losing his children. He said he
has had dreams about his first wife and each child.
   ``Each of them came to me in individual dreams and told me they
were all right,'' he said. ``It made me believe in an afterlife.
That helped me accept their deaths a lot.''
   Carol said Andy has made her dream of having a family again a
reality. They hope to adopt a child.
   ``That would make the circle complete,'' Carol said. ``We'd make
great parents.''

<HEAD>Portugal's Hidden Jews Begin to Emerge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL AMES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELMONTE, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 500 years of being Roman
Catholic in public and keeping their Jewish traditions alive in
private, the Jews of Belmonte are cautiously leaving their
self-made ghetto of secrecy.
   The community of about 300 in this hilltop village in the heart
of Portugal dates from the late 15th century.
   It was then that thousands of Sephardic Jews chose conversion to
Catholicism as an alternative to expulsion, torture or death at the
hands of the Inquisition.
   The Jews became known as Marranos, a word believed to derive
from the old Spanish for pig and still an insult in the Belmonte
community, and defied their Roman Catholic persecutors by
practicing their religion clandestinely.
   Portuguese monarchs, eager for tax revenue and Jewish talent,
had protected the thriving Sephardic community in their own country
and offered shelter to Jews persecuted in neighboring Spain.
Sepharad is the Hebrew name for the area now comprising Spain and
Portugal.
   After 1496, however, King Manuel I forced about 80,000 Jews to
convert to Catholicism in order to seal a royal alliance with
Spain's powerful rulers, Ferdinand and Isabella. Four years
earlier, Isabella had signed an edict expelling from Spain all Jews
who refused to convert.
   Manuel's successor, John III, decided to hunt out heretics and
hidden Jews. Portuguese inquisitors ordered the first burning of a
heretic in 1543, and the last occurred in 1765.
   Even 169 years after Portugal formally abolished the
Inquisition, Belmonte's Jews find it hard to be open about their
religion.
   They still attend Mass with their Catholic neighbors at the
village church where, for so many generations, they have been
baptized, married and buried under marble tombstones.
   ``They've lived on the outside like Christians. ... On the
inside, in their houses, they were not Christians, they were Jews,
and they have transmitted this from father to son,'' said Colette
Avital, Israel's ambassador to Portugal.
   Jewish leaders still hesitate to tell outsiders their story.
   Licinda Melo, a village official, said: ``Jewish community
leaders have asked me to tell tourists, even tourists from Israel,
that there are no more Jews living here, that it's just a legend.''
   The reluctance is reflected in suspicions that remain between
Jews and the 3,000 or so Catholics in Belmonte. The village is in
one of Europe's poorest regions, the mountains of Lower Beira
province, and many families live on the equivalent of less than
$200 a month.
   Antonieta Garcia, who has worked with Belmonte's Jews for 20
years and is married to the mayor, said other villagers resent the
relative wealth of some Jewish families.
   Most Jews are tradesmen at the region's bustling country fairs
and markets and some own textile factories, Belmonte's economic
mainstay.
   Tumbledown, dry-wall stone houses that once formed the village's
Jewish ghetto now are occupied by employees of the factories, most
of whom are Catholics.
   Illiteracy and superstition, common in the region, contribute to
tensions between Catholics and Jews.
   An elderly villager, who would not give her name, said she often
had seen Jews dressed in white dancing by the river under a full
moon.
   ``I don't know what they're afraid of, what they're ashamed
of,'' she said. ``We Roman Catholics are not ashamed of our
religion.''
   Sammuel Swartz, a Polish Jew working in the area as a mining
engineer, discovered the Belmonte community in 1917 and wrote:
``They were completely ignorant of the existance of other Jews with
different religious rites to the New Christians.''
   The old women who acted as keepers of the faith did not
recognize Swartz's Hebrew prayers and rejected him.
   Today, confidence is slowly growing and leaders of the community
are beginning contacts with other Jews.
   In 1988, President Mario Soares met Jews in an old ghetto in
nearby Castelo de Vide and formally apologized for the Inquisition.
   After centuries of clandestine meetings in attics and darkened
rooms, Belmonte Jews now gather to pray in a small, two-story house
off the main square.
   Elias Nunes, elected president of the Jewish community, says
plans exist to build a synagogue with financial support from Jews
in Europe, Israel and the United States.
   He hopes the synagogue and a cultural center will be built
beside an olive grove, the probable site of a Jewish temple in the
12th century.
   Belmonte's Jews are accustomed to their own version of Judaism
and may have difficulty adapting to a more orthodox religion.
   They had no rabbis or books and their Jewish traditions, rituals
and prayers have been passed on by women through generations,
taking on many aspects of the Catholic surroundings.
   Jewish prayers and religious services in Belmonte are led by
women, in Portuguese.
   As the Sabbath begins at dusk on Friday, small oil lamps, ``the
Lord's lamps'' flicker in Jewish homes instead of the more
traditional white candles.
   The Jewish festivals of Pesach and Yom Kippur are kept, but on
days differernt from those in the Jewish calendar. Pesach has been
renamed Pascoa, Portuguese for Easter.
   During Pesach, the Jews beat the waters of the Zezere River with
olive branches to symbolize the parting of the Red Sea and the
Exodus from Egypt.
   They also celebrate the Christian festival of Ascension as one
of their holiest days, when the community gathers to sing and dance
in the open air.
   Late in December, they have a festival called Natalinho, little
Christmas.
   Younger Jews are more open in supporting a return to orthodoxy.
Some young men have been circumcised, the men are taking over
dominant roles in religious services and a there is stricter
adherence to the Sabbath ban on work.
   ``What's needed is a cemetery'' for Jews, said Moises Abrantes.
   Looking up at the granite crucifix above the church, he frowned.
``I'm in my 80s,'' he said. ``I've not got much time left and I
don't want anybody putting any cross over me after I've gone.''

<HEAD>Improving Health and Lowering Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Douglas Ratner believed so strongly that
health care costs needn't rise in perpetuity that he set out to
prove it. His program has improved health, bolstered morale and,
yes, cut costs.
   ``People respond to incentives, to personal responsibility,'' he
says, lamenting the scarcity of such elements in most group health
insurance plans. His Wealth From Health Organization includes these
and more.
   It is long-range, cost-effective, health-enhancing. The benefits
of good health seem capable of making a big long-term dent in
costs, but it has immediate benefits too, for the individual,
employer, insurer, country.
   Simplified, it awards favorable health behavior or practice with
credits or points applied to a Wealth From Health Account, which
the individual can use in many ways, such as to lower deductible
insurance payments.
   Points are awarded in various categories. In the Wealth From The
Heart category, for instance, an employee might earn points for
losing weight, lowering blood pressure or cholesterol and improving
aerobic fitness.
   The point system may be as varied as desired: Wealth From
Knowledge, Wealth From A Healthy Family, Wealth From Practicing
Safety First, Wealth For Following Doctors' Orders. Generally
simple tests confirm improvements.
   The individual's approach to work and lifestyle must change,
says Ratner. ``Workers must accept responsibility for affecting
change, rather than relying on some other party.'' Lifestyle, he
declares, is the basic cost-determinant.
   Ratner, 37, tested his program in April 1988, implementing it in
conjunction with the Mount Vernon Hospital, a suburban,
not-for-profit facility where he is associate director of the
Internal Medicine Residency Program.
   Calling it the Health Responsibility Program, he offered it to
the hospital's non-union, full-time employees on a voluntary basis,
with each garnered point equaling $1.
   Seventy-three percent of those eligible, or 163 participants,
enrolled. The results, said the doctor, ``exceeded our wildest
expectations.''
   Forty-eight percent initially were overweight, but more than
half had lost an average 7.3 pounds by the one-year check point.
   Sixty-one percent of those initially found hypertensive had
normalized their blood pressure through diet or medicine at the
three-month check point.
   Fifteen percent of those who smoked quit during the two months
between the program's orientation and its inception, and 26 percent
of those who still smoked had quit completely at the one-year mark.
   Costs were cut. The personnel department found that program
participants lowered their medical claims to $411.70 per person in
1988 from $686.06 in 1987. Meanwhile, non-participant costs soared
to $1,532.84 from $798.87.
   Those figures, it should be noted, do not include savings that
might be attributed to decreased absenteeism, increased
productivity, or lessened pressure on the future cost structure by
fewer claims.
   ``Based on our breakthrough experience here at the Mount Vernon
Hospital, the time is now for bold, innovative measures,'' says
Ratner, who feels he has demonstrated several assumptions,
especially the lifestyle factor in costs.
   And more: that employees will adapt to the system because it is
fair, and it works because it involves personal responsibility, is
incentive based, goal oriented, and intuitively as well as
historically sound.
   After viewing the results, Ratner himself took the bold measures
he called for, structuring the Health Responsibility Program and
its unique point system into a package that can be utilized in any
company's flexible benefits system.
   Working with Robert Thurston of the Human Resource Consulting
Group, a Salt Lake City marketing operation, points from Ratner's
program can be committed in myriad ways to customized health
benefit packages offered by employers.
   What will the points buy? You name it. Good health, to be sure,
but dollars too, or more vacation time or lower insurance
deductibles, for example. In fact, a catalog of possibilities
already has been developed.
   Ratner, father of two, sees the incentives as a way to promote
not just worker health but that of entire families, since family
members often affect health insurance costs as much or more than
workers themselves.
   America's job, he says, is ``to refocus the entire American
psyche,'' to become aggressive against the enemy of rising costs,
and to beat them. He wonders, he says, how we have remained so
passive in view of the threat.

   In an upcoming ``true life'' cable movie
about the Watts riots as experienced by the Los Angeles Times'
first black reporter, here's what you won't see:
   _ The firing of ``reporter trainee'' Robert Richardson the same
month the Times won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the riots.
   _ Richardson's battle with alcoholism and arrest on a theft
charge, and the tragedy and turmoil that followed the inexperienced
journalist's brief tenure at the Times.
   Debates over the accuracy of docu-dramas have created as much
controversy as the events they re-create.
   A 1987 made-for-TV NBC movie about the Billionaire Boys Club
prompted an outcry from defense attorneys who claimed it
jeopardized BBC leader Joe Hunt's right to a fair trial. Hunt was
convicted of murdering a con man who threatened the get-rich-quick
scheme Hunt hatched with some Ivy League pals.
   A 1985 dramatization of the Atlanta child murders started an
uproar over its sympathetic portrayal of Wayne Williams, who still
was appealing his 1982 conviction when CBS broadcast the show.
   Blending truth and fiction for the sake of compelling television
is a little like playing God. Truth is what the producer and
screenwriter say it is.
   In ``Heat Wave,'' now in production for Ted Turner's TNT cable
network, here is the truth you will see:
   _ Blair Underwood of ``L.A. Law'' playing Richardson, a
24-year-old black messenger in the classified advertising
department who is promoted to the newsroom after phoning in the
looting and burning that leveled Watts in August 1965.
   _ The inability of the all-white Times news staff to get inside
until Richardson, who lived in the area, volunteered his help. It
was Richardson who told Times readers that rampaging youths were
screaming, ``Burn, baby, burn.''
   _ A postscript to the movie that says the Times went on to win a
Pulitzer for its Watts coverage and Richardson went on to become
the paper's first black reporter.
   But Richardson did not ride off into a journalistic sunset. In
May 1966, nine months after his promotion and in the same month the
Times was awarded its Pulitzer, Richardson was fired.
   ``Heat Wave'' screenwriter Michael Lazarou said that detail, and
Richardson's subsequent troubles, are irrelevant to the script.
   ``We are talking about an extraordinary set of circumstances in
which the Los Angeles Times was hamstrung,'' Lazarou said. ``What
happened to Bob Richardson later doesn't matter. What is important
is that the lessons of the Watts riots went largely unlearned. That
is what's relevant.''
   Although Richardson is the lead character and was paid a fee for
his story rights, ``Heat Wave'' _ to be televised in August _ is
really about Watts, Lazarou said.
   Pressed about Richardson, Lazarou refused further interviews. In
two memos, he refused to answer more questions about the script or
Richardson, who he said is now a close friend.
   In one memo, Lazarou wrote: ``Though alcoholism played a role in
a misdeameanor conviction, later dropped, which ended his career at
the Times,'' Richardson went on to work for local radio stations.
   Lazarou continued: ``As Bob will openly admit, his life has
certainly had it's highs and lows. ... But his courage and his
contribution to the Los Angeles Times during it's hour of need
cannot and should not be minimized.''
   Richardson could not be located for an interview. ``He's not
available right now,'' said Turner spokeswoman Alison Hill. He is
not listed in the Los Angeles phone book. Times reporters who
worked with him during the riots said they have not talked with him
in 25 years.
   ``It was not working out for him to be a reporter. He was let
go. He never functioned as a reporter. He did not go out and cover
the riots. He did contribute stuff, but it was kind of personal
reflections,'' said Eric Malnic, a Times reporter who helped cover
the riots.
   Those reflections included this description: ``I had to do all
of my telephoning from street-corner booths in gas stations. You
have no idea how naked you can feel in an exposed, lighted
telephone booth.
   ``But I was hep at that time. Whenever a group of Negroes
approached to look me over I knew what to do. You open the door,
stick your head out and shout, `Burn, baby, burn.' Then you are
safe.''
   Lazarou's script was approved by the Times. Former Times Editor
Bill Thomas, who was city editor during the riots, also signed off
on the script, which uses his name.
   ``This stuff is dredging up memories that are really dim,''
Thomas said. ``He was an inexperienced reporter and there were some
problems with that. ... But I don't remember too many details.''
   Richardson was seen in March at a Skid Row residential program
for alcoholic men, said a Salvation Army employee who wouldn't let
his name be used. ``I had seen him there about a year before. I
guess he had re-entered the program,'' the employee said.
   ``He was such a nice man. My impression was that this was
someone who had had a very interesting journalistic career, but had
had some very bad times.''

   A quarter-century before the Lower
Mississippi Delta Development Commission started roaming that
region to chart solutions for its misery, a similar agency had a
similar mission to ease similar misery.
   In 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced a national ``War
on Poverty'' from a front porch in Inez, Ky. The next year,
Congress set up the Appalachian Regional Commission, which
incorporated many of the poverty programs, to help Appalachia catch
up with the rest of the nation in jobs, health services, education
and transportation.
   Today, improvements have been made, but many of the 20.5 million
people in the 13 states of Appalachia still live in wretchedness,
in homes little more than shanties with no sewer systems and no
running water.
   The creeks around Keystone are so dirty and dotted with toilet
paper that locals have dubbed the result ``the Charmin Trail.''
   Richard Mullins, a 44-year-old unemployed miner who receives
$744 a month in government benefits, lives with his wife and three
children under a patchwork roof that leaks into one bedroom when it
rains. The floors are full of holes and sinking, the paint is
peeling and rats run about the house at will.
   ``We're still trying to find something better because this house
is really not worth the $50 we pay a month,'' said Mullins' wife,
Darlene.
   The Appalachian region encompasses all of West Virginia and
parts of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Ohio, New York,
Pennsylvania and Maryland.
   Monroe Newman, senior economist for the Appalachian commission,
asserts that the region as a whole is vastly better off, with 2
million more jobs than it had 25 years ago, mainly in the service
industries, and with improved health care, education and highways.
   But ``better off'' is relative. According to the latest data
available from the Appalachian commission, based on the 1980
census, 14 percent of the region's people live below the poverty
level; nationally 12.4 percent of the populace is below that level.
   Their personal income per capita in 1987 averaged $12,453,
compared to $15,484 nationally. Last year's average unemployment
rate ran 5.9 percent, six-tenths higher than the national average.
   The poverty has spawned a host of social problems including
drugs, gangs and teen-age pregnancies among youth who have little
to do. In some areas, for instance, it is a 40-mile round trip to a
movie.
   The hardest hit towns are in the coal-dominated counties of West
Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and southeastern Ohio, Newman said.
More than 100,000 jobs have been lost in the Appalachian coal
fields since 1978. In some counties in these states, unemployment
runs more than twice as high as the national average.
   ``They ain't enough jobs for nobody,'' said Clady Johnson of
Trammel, Va. ``If kids graduate here, they got to leave to get a
job.''
   She knows firsthand. Her son, Gregory, 23, enlisted in the Army
when he couldn't find a job. Mrs. Johnson, who is divorced, lives
on $386 a month in government benefits.
   The Commission on Religion in Appalachia says that ``in spite of
the obvious effectiveness of anti-poverty programs, the war was not
won. Poverty rates remain unacceptably high, and the risk of
poverty is much greater for some regions and population groups than
others.''
   ``It is bleak,'' said Jim Sessions, executive coordinator of the
commission, a coalition of 17 religious denominations formed to
fight poverty. ``Survival is the name of the game.''
   Sessions said things did improve in the late 1960s and through
the 1970s with the economy rebounding and the building of
hospitals, clinics, community colleges and highways.
   But in the recession of the early 1980s, he said, Appalachia
lost 2{ manufacturing jobs for every single job gained in the prior
decade. He especially noted coal jobs lost in West Virginia and
Virginia; steel jobs in Pennsylvania, and textile jobs throughout
the Tennessee Valley.
   ``In terms of employment and income, all the progress we made
was wiped out in two years at the beginning of the Reagan
administration, and we've not regained it yet and probably won't,''
Sessions said. ``We've moved our industrial base to a service
resort and recreation economy, which at best pays minimum wage.''

   For nearly a decade, states in the Mississippi Delta region have
pursued tough education reforms, and they are starting to get
results.
   Last month, Kentucky Gov. Wallace Wilkinson signed legislation
that will overhaul public education. The changes were enacted after
the state Supreme Court in June found the public school system
inequitable and unconstitutional.
   Spending varied district to district from $1,800 to $4,200. Now
a state minimum, $2,900, has been established. In addition, the new
Kentucky law calls for committees of parents, teachers and
principals to make day-to-day school decisions.
   In Mississippi, Gov. Ray Mabus also signed legislation in April,
continuing education reforms begun in the early 1980s that have
raised standardized test scores for the last four years and
increased accountability by requiring district ``report cards.''
   One measure commits $182 million to curriculum improvements in
the next three years; another calls for $800 million in bonds to
replace aging school buildings and buses. Mabus has said he'll call
a special legislative session in June to work out how to finance
the plan.
   Arkansas' education reforms have reduced class sizes, added
support personnel and expanded the curriculum, particularly
language, science and math courses.
   A 1-cent sales tax hike and a teacher testing policy were among
reforms pushed by Gov. Bill Clinton in 1983.
   Since then, his office says, 1,400 people who failed the teacher
tests are out of the classroom, 17,000 more students are taking
foreign-language classes than in 1983, 15 percent more students are
attending college, dropout rates have improved and test scores are
up.
   In Tennessee, a draft of Gov. Ned McWherter's 1991 package
spells out 12 major goals, from requiring kindergarten to better
preparing college freshmen to do college-level work.
   The plan also calls for ``performance audit teams'' in the state
education department.
   Reforms in Louisiana have included reducing classroom size,
rewarding successful schools and raising teachers' pay, though hard
times in the state's petroleum industry have cut revenues. One
effort Gov. Buddy Roemer is pushing is a $30 million computer-based
reading lab.
   The states still fall behind much of the nation in per-pupil
spending.
   According to the National Center for Educational Statistics in
Washington, the national average expenditure was $4,243 in 1987-88,
the last year for which complete figures were available.
   The comparable state figures were: Kentucky, $3,011;
Mississippi, $2,548; Arkansas, $2,989; Tennessee, $3,068; and
Louisiana, $3,138.

<HEAD>PART V: Bridging the Gap _ What's the Future for the Delta?</HEAD>

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Decades of racism, economic failure and
indifference have sapped the Mississippi Delta region of
opportunity and hope for many of its 8 million residents. This
final report of a five-day AP Extra series, ``Children of the
Delta,'' examines whether the Delta's future is destined to be its
past.

   The majestic steel bridge, tall as an
office tower and wide as a freeway, was supposed to tie the
less-developed west bank of the Mississippi River to the east
bank's world of industrial plants, jobs and development.
   But no traffic crosses the $81 million structure. On the west
bank below, trash is heaped in weed-choked fields, and shanties sit
on squat pillars of red brick. Near the river's edge, a concrete
pier a hundred feet tall holds up nothing but the clouds.
   The Gramercy-Wallace Bridge, you see, never was completed. It
was in the works for nine years, but Louisiana ran out of money and
construction was halted in 1987 before access ramps were built.
   So it goes in the Mississippi Delta. Today, the unreachable span
is a bleak symbol of just how difficult it is to bridge the gap
between poverty and prosperity.
   ``All we can do is hope and pray that they will finish the
bridge and things will come better,'' said Jessie Allen, owner of
Allen's Bridge-View Grocery store.
   Until the bridge is completed, probably not until 1994, rusting
and sometimes unreliable ferries fight the swift river current to
move a handful of cars and a pittance of commerce across the river.
The nearest bridge is 30 miles upriver.
   Here, as elsewhere up and down the impoverished Delta region,
which includes parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee, the muddy river itself is at
times a barrier blocking growth.
   Without good transportation, plants have located elsewhere.
Without jobs, residents rely on food stamps and welfare. Without
hope, they move away, or resign themselves to the heritage of
poverty.
   ``The Mississippi River divides the region instead of unifying
it,'' said Stan Hyland, a Memphis State University anthropologist.
Hyland has worked with the Lower Mississippi River Delta
Development Commission, which has studied the region for 18 months.
   ``It's probably a quirk of history,'' Hyland said. ``The unique
history of the region, the richness, the river, has worked against
it. It's a great irony.''
   State and local leaders say reversing the Delta's misfortunes
will take improvement in education, economic planning, political
relations among blacks and whites, and building bridges and
highways for development.
   Lake Providence, La., has no bridge across the river. Its only
claim to fame these days is that it has the highest unemployment
rate _ about 18 percent _ in the state with the nation's highest
unemployment rate.
   ``The river is a wall,'' said Ed Dauphine, president of the
Louisiana Delta Bank in Lake Providence, across the river from
Mississippi.
   ``We are a welfare-based economy, and part of that is because I
don't have any opportunity to sell any product in the state of
Mississippi. There's not a nickel's worth of commerce we're dealing
with over there.''
   The irony here, as elsewhere in the Delta, is that the rich
farmland may hold people back more than it helps them.
   Locals, black and white, say the few white families who own the
land blocked development efforts for fear of raising the cost of
farm labor. High unemployment means an ample supply of cheap ``hoe
hands'' _ seasonal laborers to chop cotton and tend fields.
   ``It's colonial,'' said Wilbur Hawkins, executive director of
the Delta commission. ``The welfare system supports the poor _ and
the rich _ and it's going to take everyone working together to
reverse that.''
   Olly Neal led boycotts of white-owned businesses and established
a health clinic for the poor in Marianna, Ark., in the early '70s.
   Today, conditions are different, Neal said, but not necessarily
better.
   ``I certainly don't believe that economically African-Americans
are any better off,'' he said. ``We have no ownership in financial
institutions, for example, and unemployment rates are comparable to
the '70s.''
   Now an attorney, Neal continues his fight, but through the
political process. He was one in a group of blacks that
successfully sued the state claiming Arkansas' legislative district
boundary lines discriminated against blacks.
   A federal judge ordered some lines redrawn, and Neal now
believes the Delta will have more than one black representative in
the Arkansas statehouse.
   ``Politics is the only place I think substantial change can come
here in the Delta, and that change only comes by African-Americans
being more insistent,'' he said. ``We have to insist on having an
adequate share of the political offices.''
   Change, though, doesn't come easy.
   ``It's much too slow for me,'' Neal said. ``Half the population
here in the `deep Delta' is African-American, and almost none of
the leadership. That cuts out half of the ideas, half of the
enthusiasm.
   ``Half the population here is a drag on the other half. Half the
team is sitting down, not by choice but by acquiescence, in part,
and by insistence of the white population.''
   Most agree that improvement in the Delta will be slow.
   ``The problems of the region didn't get like this overnight, and
we can't fix them overnight either,'' Hawkins said. ``We didn't
plan to fail _ we failed to plan.''
   In a report to Congress on May 14, the commission will recommend
developing tourism as a means of economic growth, along with
regional cooperation on marketing Delta products. It will seek
greater federal funds to help the poor and programs to help with
education reform.
   ``Education is the key, we know it,'' said Louisiana Gov. Buddy
Roemer. ``There are 8 million people in the Delta and one
characteristic stands out _ too many of us are not equipped
educationally.''
   Annie Brown, daughter of a sharecropper, is already trying to
make a difference.
   In a pale-green classroom that was a sheriff's office, six
adults sing the alphabet to a rap beat: ``Before too long you'll be
picking up speed, before you know it you'll be able to read ...''
   These students, some unable to write their names when they
enrolled, are part of a volunteer literacy program in Rolling Fork,
Miss., run by Mrs. Brown. The program has attracted 242 residents
in five years, and 27 have passed high-school diploma equivalency
tests.
   Her effort is being copied in other parts of the Delta, and
commission members cite it as an example of the change that must
come to improve the future.
   ``I'm saying to the community, `Let's educate our parents.'
Mother cannot read, Father cannot read, so there's no reinforcement
for the children,'' Mrs. Brown said. ``In the black community, nine
out of 10 times if you find illiteracy, the whole family is
illiterate.''
   With little funding and only volunteers to help, hers is a
lonely battle, one that typifies how difficult it will be to bring
about change.
   ``We're trying to break the cycle,'' Mrs. Brown said. ``The
cycle must be opened up.''

<HEAD>Fighting Both Corruption and Separatism Swamps Indian FBI</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India's version of the FBI, already
swamped by corruption investigations, has stretched itself thinner
by joining the fight against separatist movements.
   The Central Bureau of Investigation has been in the news most
often for probing deals made while Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was
in office. Gandhi lost his job in November's elections to
anti-corruption candidate V.P. Singh.
   Now the bureau also is handling routine murder cases in troubled
Jammu-Kashmir state, pursuing anti-terrorist investigations in
violent Punjab and looking into a tribal revolt in faraway Assam.
   The man with his finger in the dike is Rajendra Shekhar,
director general of the bureau, a 55-year-old career policeman from
the western desert state of Rajasthan.
   ``I'm losing weight,'' he said in an interview. ``We're the
busiest we've ever been.''
   Shekhar looked worn out. These days he drinks jasmine tea with
lime, which is supposed to improve his appetite.
   Faced with local police forces that are too busy, too frightened
or too partisan, Shekhar directed his agents to take over
investigations in Kashmir. At least 300 people have been killed in
the northwestern state since the government cracked down on a
Moslem separatist movement in January.
   Just south of Kashmir, bureau agents are investigating
separatist violence by Sikh extremists in Punjab state.
   Many Punjab police are virtually confined to their barracks
because they are favorite targets of Sikh extremists, who have
killed more than 5,800 people in Punjab since 1987.
   In Assam, a remote northeastern state, bureau agents are looking
closely at the Bodos, an animist tribe that believes spirits live
in rocks and trees. The Bodos want a separate state within India
and have attacked Assamese Hindus.
   The real work of Shekhar's agency, however, is fighting
corruption.
   India's British colonial rulers established the Central Bureau
of Investigation soon after World War II to investigate links
between Indian businessmen and the government. That work continued
after independence in 1947.
   Of the 1,200 cases filed by the bureau's 3,907 agents every
year, about 1,000 are corruption-related, Shekhar said.
   Corruption is the grease of South Asia's wheels.
   Traffic cops routinely take ``baksheesh,'' small cash payments,
to ignore violations. Businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks
part of the job.
   Shekhar said the problem has been growing.
   Industrialization, inflation, development, unemployment _ all
contribute to it, he said, and ``the facets that give impetus to
corruption are getting more and more pronounced.''
   Preliminary charges have been filed in three cases involving
members of Gandhi's government. Two concern alleged payment of
bribes by Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium and
Hawaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a West German submarine manufacturer.
   A former high-level civil servant was charged in connection with
a $1.47 billion Airbus deal for 38 planes and a former defense
secretary was named in a case involving four West German subs worth
$334 million.
   The agency also has filed preliminary charges related to a $1.4
billion artillery contract with the Swedish arms manufacturer AB
Bofors. Bureau investigators have charged Bofors with cheating
India out of $37 million and Indian government officials, not
identified, with criminal misconduct.
   Charges related to an alleged political dirty tricks campaign
against the son of Prime Minster Singh are expected soon.
   Western diplomats say the growing scope of bureau responsibily
is a sign local police cannot cope with the level and complexity of
crime in India.
   It also indicates, they say, that the central government does
not trust local officials.
   ``Under these circumstances, it's easy for the law enforcment
process to break down,'' a diplomat said, on condition of
anonymity. ``The bureau is stretched too thin. They don't have good
relations with local police and the crooks keep committing crimes.''
   Critics say many of the bureau's investigations are politically
motivated.
   Charges of corruption haunted the Gandhi administration. Singh,
formerly Gandhi's finance minister, quit the government when his
corruption investigations were stymied.
   Diplomats say there appears to be vindictiveness in the
investigations, and cite the one concerning the prime minister's
son.
   By forcing the bureau to concentrate on what many consider a
minor case, Singh's administration is using law enforcement to
fight its political battles, another Western diplomat said.
   Shekhar denied his bureau could be used for political purposes.
   ``Our work has nothing to with politics,'' he said. ``If we
think the case is legitimate, we investigate.''
   Shekhar made his mark late in his career when he led the
investigation of one of India's biggest bank robberies, the theft
of $3.35 million from the Punjab National Bank in 1987.
   Ten of the original 24 suspects wound up dead, but Shekhar says
the police didn't kill them.
   Several others disappeared and only a few were convicted and
jailed. In the Indian context, the case was considered a success.
   The director general looks at his current post in a similar
light: Incremental steps can be taken, but no major changes should
be expected.
   ``If we can set an example with one or two corruption cases, I
suppose we are doing our job,'' Shekhar said. ``But, then again,
nobody could pay any attention.''

   Most of the increase would benefit the Food Stamp Program,
described by FRAC as ``our best and most consistent line of defense
against hunger.''
   As written, the bill also provides increases of $70 million in
each of the next two fiscal years for the commodities program known
as TEFAP (Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program).
   This temporary, emergency program began eight years ago and was
formalized in 1983 as the Reagan administration began using
non-profit agencies to distribute butter and cheese acquired under
the dairy price-support program.
   Along with reducing stockpiles _ the primary objective _ TEFAP
also played a key role in expanding the non-profit food network.
   Critics call it a poorly targeted ``handout'' program lacking
nutritional goals. Supporters point to the delivery of 6.5 billion
pounds of food, much of it high in protein, to feeding programs
otherwise largely dependent upon food industry waste.
   The Mickey Leland bill also continues through 1995 current
funding levels of $32 million a year for private soup kitchens,
which will still be necessary despite increased public spending.
   ``The nation will not see a major difference in terms of soup
and bread lines,'' says J. Larry Brown, chairman of the Physician
Task Force. ``Food stamps will reach more people and last a little
longer. But people will still run out of food stamps because the
basic level is so inadequate to begin with.''
   Brown and others worry that non-profit programs are becoming a
way for the government to hand off responsibility permanently.
   Many of today's federal nutrition programs _ food stamps, Women,
Infants and Children (WIC), school lunches and breakfasts, and
senior nutrition _ were started or expanded to fight an epidemic of
hunger discovered in the late 1960s. Within a decade, domestic
hunger had been greatly reduced.
   But during the '80s, spending cuts dramatically diminished the
scope of these and other ``safety net'' programs, at a time when
high unemployment, a downscaling of wages and rapidly rising
housing costs left millions of Americans below the poverty line.
   The epidemic returned.
   ``A thousand points of light do not hold a candle to
well-managed and adequately funded public programs. The main
argument for not improving these programs and stamping out domestic
hunger is a financial one _ that priorities must be set for
government spending in the face of the budget deficit,'' says Rob
Fersh, FRAC's executive director.
   If emergency food programs represent a gain for the poor, that's
acceptable, says sociologist Janet Poppendieck, director of the
Center for the Study of Family Policy at New York's Hunter College.
``If they begin to substitute, either for individuals or at the
level of public policy, they're destructive.''
   The New York City Interfaith Hunger Task Force in 1987-88 found
many non-profit agencies serving ``substantial numbers'' who may
have been eligible for public assistance but were ``not adequately
or consistently informed of their availability.'' Some
ineligibility and delayed benefits resulted from ``bureaucratic
inertia.''
   Only 12 percent of 1,970 clients surveyed in 1987 at New York
food pantries were experiencing actual emergencies.
   Massive cuts in food stamps are a major factor behind the long
lines at soup kitchens and food pantries. Between 1982 and 1985,
the program lost $7 billion, 13 percent of its budget.
   Benefits average less than 57 cents per person per meal and
reach 19 million people per month, only about half of the number
who are eligible for them. Participation dropped from 68 out of 100
people at or below poverty in 1980 to 59 out of 100 in 1985. And
nationwide studies have shown that many households run out of food
stamps five to 10 days before the end of the month.
   With the cuts came administrative crackdowns, ``churning''
recipients from the rolls for minor offenses. Food stamp recipients
may have to fill out application forms that can run 18 pages and
require complex calculations.

   Poppendieck, who analyzed Depression-era food policy in her 1986
book, ``Breadlines Knee-Deep in Wheat,'' sees the reliance on
emergency programs as ``a dramatic reversal in the direction in
which social provision had been evolving in the United States.''
   That direction, toward an increased federal role, resulted in
greater standardization of benefits, safeguarded recipients' rights
and enabled them to buy their own food, just like their neighbors.
   By contrast, volunteer programs vary from city to city and state
to state. Regardless of how well they may be treated, clients
``have no enforceable rights whatsoever,'' Poppendieck says.
   ``And far from making the lives of poor people similar to those
of the rest of society, emergency food programs tend to segregate
the poor into separate programs available only to those who assert
their poverty.''
   Unlike federal programs, non-profit efforts are fragile and
fragmented, heavily dependent on volunteers, donations and good
will, Poppendieck says. Many lack adequate facilities and are
subject to neighborhood opposition. ``How long can we reasonably
expect churches and other non-profits to keep up the enormous
effort required to respond to the `emergency?'''
   In some quarters, there is talk of closing soup kitchens and
food pantries to force government to do more.
   ``Some days,'' says Nancy Amidei, ``I would want to shut down
all the soup kitchens and food pantries in America.
   ``If that sounds too cruel, every time someone walks through a
door needing food, I would want the first action to be to call a
congressman and say, `I have a woman here with two children she
can't feed. Where should I send her?'
   ``Put the onus back on them.''
   Christina Walker, who recently resigned as executive director of
the New York Food and Hunger Hotline, worries about the possible
legacy of continued reliance on emergency services.
   ``We are creating a large, disenfranchised population that may
never find its way back to mainstream American life. People are not
going to live on handouts all through childhood, then go to work
for Citicorp.''
   For non-profit agencies, the struggle to keep up with demand for
food leaves little time for advocacy. ``You won't have to change
much in society if those people never have the time to raise their
voice,'' says Michael Lipsky, a political science professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   For some service providers, competition for funding leads to
compromises that may not always serve clients' interests.
   ``To get more bang for your buck, you need bigger programs,''
says Bill Bolling, executive director of the Atlanta Community Food
Bank.
   ``But the bigger the program, the more dehumanizing it is. If
you're feeding 50 people a day, you can have an accountable
relationship. If you're feeding 500 a day, nothing can happen.''
   Marc Thibodeau, a former Boston Food Bank board member, calls
the '80s ``the decade of the sidewalk, the soup kitchen lines. Now,
it's the '90s, and people can't believe these people are still
there. The trend is to turn away.''
   Meanwhile, a new generation is coming of age.
   ``I'm now teaching students who have grown up with soup kitchens
and food pantries, and who consider such `emergency' provisions to
be the `normal' way of dealing with destitution,'' says Poppendieck.
   As she walks the streets of New York, Christina Walker finds
herself thinking about the children of the '90s. ``What will their
picture of this country be when they grow up? It will be a
different country. Yet kids will grow up and think this is the way
we've always been.
   ``I think we did the right thing in the beginning, in thinking
we must get these people in off the streets. But now it's
snowballed out of control.
   ``A storefront Pentecostal church in a poor neighborhood with 50
congregants, themselves dirt-poor, scrounging food of questionable
nutritional value from a bunch of sources _ that's become our
safety net.
   ``There really is a big irony here, one that lots of people are
wrestling with. In setting out initially to fix something, we've
become part of what's broken.''

<HEAD>Western Europe's ``Night Of Barbarism'' Began May 10, 1940</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Europe waited for the
Germans in spring 1940, but France felt safe behind the Maginot
Line and Holland hoped to stay neutral. The Dutch army drafted
Cornelius Stam and gave him an 1895 rifle.
   ``We didn't do a damn thing, really,'' Stam recalled last month.
``We were just sitting in the sun'' when Adolf Hitler's death
machine rolled west on May 10, 1940, casting Western Europe into
what Winston Churchill called a ``long night of barbarism.''
   The onslaught by bombers, tanks and 2 million Wehrmacht and SS
soldiers caught the victims unprepared.
   Nazi Germany needed only four days to conquer the Netherlands,
which had been neutral in World War I. Hitler's legions swept the
patchwork defenses aside and destroyed the Dutch fighting spirit
with carpet bombing of Rotterdam.
   Two decades of peace in Europe had ended nearly eight months
earlier with the German invasion of Poland. Britain and France
declared war on Germany as a result, but there had been little
combat in the west.
   When the Germans invaded, officers ``had us march around at 4 in
the morning, toting our rifles on our shoulders, out of sheer
madness,'' Stam said in an interview.
   At dawn May 10, German bombers destroyed major military
airfields in Holland and Hitler's troops poured across the border.
Tanks directed by Field Marshall Gerd von Rundstedt began a sweep
through Belgium, Luxembourg and northern France to the Atlantic,
meeting little resistance.
   Belgium surrendered May 28 after 6,552 civilians and 6,236
soldiers had been killed. Luxembourg's government fled to London on
the invasion's first day.
   Unlike Wilhelmina, the Dutch queen, King Leopold III of Belgium
decided to remain in his country under German occupation. Leopold
ultimately became so deeply compromised that he was forced to
abdicate in 1950.
   Soon after Belgium capitulated, German troops turned south
toward Paris.
   About 70,000 French soldiers were killed in the futile,
six-week-long attempt to halt the German advance, more than all the
Americans killed in Vietnam.
   France relied on the Maginot Line along the German border, a
static defense system based on the tactics of World War I. The
tanks of German panzer divisions swept around the northern end into
France by cutting through the Ardennes forest.
   The Dutch depended on the Water Line, last used successfully in
the 16th century war for independence from Spain, which involved a
ring of flooded land around Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. The
Germans sent waves of paratroopers, against whom flood was no
defense.
   ``It was a very fine morning,'' said Arie Dekker, who was a
15-year-old office boy near Rotterdam when the paratroopers came.
``The pilots were waving at us. ... They'd been told they were
protecting us from the British.''
   Queen Wilhelmina and her government fled to London on May 13.
The next day, when organized resistance was all but crushed, the
Luftwaffe returned to Rotterdam for a pre-announced bombing raid
that leveled its central district and killed about 800 people.
   ``The sun totally vanished,'' said Dekker's wife, Cornelia,
whose family lived in Krimpen aan de Lek, a nearby town. ``At
first, we thought it was a thunderstorm.''
   In four days, the German offensive had killed 2,600 Dutch
civilians and 2,000 soldiers. It began a five-year occupation
horror of starvation, slave labor and deportations to death camps.
   As Holland fell, von Rundstedt's tanks linked up with another
German army group from the north to encircle British and French
troops near the port of Dunkirk in northern France.
   Despite concentrated German air and artillery attacks, 340,000
Allied soldiers escaped to England over a 10-day period, most of
them in small boats commandeered for the rescue.
   Brig. Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who later commanded the Free
French forces from England, led one of the few French
counteroffensives, near Abbeville in the northwest. The Germans
bombed Abbeville to rubble May 20.
   ``There was nothing left after the bombing,'' said Louis
Werheim, who was 6 at the time.
   Werheim and his family fled before the raid. When they returned,
he said, ``There were bodies of French soldiers in our courtyard.
They'd been shot by the Germans.''
   On June 22, France agreed to an armistice. Two-thirds of its
territory was occupied and a collaborationist government under
Marshal Henri-Philippe Petain, the World War I hero, ran the
unoccupied southeastern sector.
   About 1.5 million French soldiers were taken prisoner and held
until the end of the war.
   Civilian hardship followed military surrender.
   Men were shipped from the occupied countries to work as slave
labor in the German war industry. The Netherlands, then primarily
an agricultural economy, was gradually stripped of food to feed the
conquerors.
   Starvation spread through the country. The ``hunger winter'' of
1944 is one of the Dutch people's strongest collective memories.
   Nazi officials used the Dutch penchant for keeping meticulous
records to track down the country's 150,000 Jews, and shipped them
to death camps. Only 6,000 survived.
   The most famous war victim in the the Netherlands was Anne
Frank, a Jewish teenager born in Germany whose diary, written in
hiding with her family, is perhaps the most poignant memorial to
the death camps.
   Most of the Jews in Belgium, Luxembourg and France also died in
the camps.
   Anti-Nazi underground movements were organized in the occupied
countries.
   After the Dutch surrender, Stam used his position with the
Nazi-run Amsterdam Labor Bureau to obtain ration cards for Jews and
resistance fighters in hiding, and to hamper deportation of workers
for slave labor.
   Dekker, the office boy, was 18 when the Germans sent him to
Hamburg to work in a shipyard. He spent three years there and
returned after the war with a busload of Dutch Jews who survived
the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg.

<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago, Hitler's blitzkrieg overran
Belgium, the Netherlands and France. Now they are partners of
Germany, but cautious about the prospect of a unified powerhouse
next door.
   The French, whose Maginot Line could not stop the Germans, now
lead an effort to guarantee them a central role in a single-market
Western Europe.
   French, Belgian and Dutch officials say the closer the ties the
better, suggesting a non-aligned Germany would cause greater
concern.
   ``I have always believed the arbitrary division of Germany was
senseless,'' said Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, ``but
the situation inherited from the war cannot be improved without the
participation of other countries.''
   West Germany is the largest trading partner of all three
countries conquered by German forces in a six-week onslaught that
began May 10, 1940. Its relationship with France is particularly
close, encompassing everything from military cooperation to
cultural television programming.
   ``French-German friendship is more alive than ever,'' President
Francois Mitterrand, once a German prisoner of war, said at the end
of a harmonious two-day summit in late April with Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   In Normandy, which was devastated by the battles that followed
the Allied invasion of June 1944, dozens of towns have established
``twin city'' relationships with German municipalities.
   State-owned Aerospatiale of France recently began a joint
helicopter production project with Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm,
which made many of Hitler's warplanes.
   Among the most vivid symbols of French-German reconciliation is
a joint army brigade, 2,100 soldiers from each country, being
deployed in West Germany.
   Brigade officers have overcome language difficulties and even a
potential wardrobe dispute. The men will wear French-style blue
berets, but tilt them to the right in accordance with German custom.
   Klaus Becher and Ingo Kolboom, of the Research Institute of the
German Society for Foreign Policy, have proposed stationing
additional French-German brigades in East Germany after
unification, to replace Soviet troops.
   The French-German relationship dates to a treaty signed in 1963
by President Charles de Gaulle and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. The
governments have closer and more systematic consultation on
political, military and economic matters than any other two in
Western Europe.
   Polls indicate the French and Germans consider each other their
closest foreign friends. Kohl and Mitterrand embodied this
sentiment in 1984 when they joined hands at Verdun, the World War I
battle site, in dedicating a plaque consecrating the reconciliation
of France and Germany.
   There appear to be few plans for marking the 50th anniversary of
the German entry into Paris, June 14, or the French surrender June
22.
   ``The French don't like to celebrate defeat,'' said Dominique
Moisi, associate director of the French Institute of Foreign
Relations. He suggested the French would focus on De Gaulle, who on
June 18, 1940, made his first radio appeal from England to his
countrymen to resist the occupation.
   Moisi said in an interview that fear of a powerful united
Germany is based ``more on the French lack of confidence in their
ability to compete than mistrust of Germany.''
   Political analyst Pierre Lellouche wrote in Le Point magazine:
``In Paris, where they officially pretend to rejoice at German
unity ... they worry in private about its consequences,''
   Some French officials anticipate the development of a German
superpower that would ``reduce France to a secondary role,'' he
said.
   Wolfgang Bergsdorf, a Kohl adviser, cited a poll recently
indicating 68 percent of French people favored German unification.
   ``Unhappily, the politicians in France, in contrast to the
general population, are reticent now that German unity has become
more than a sacred wish,'' Bergsdorf said.
   The Belgian and Dutch economies are even more intertwined with
West Germany than the French. The Dutch guilder exchange rate
closely follows the Deutschmark and Holland's interest rates are
virtually based on the West German central bank's prime rate.
   Queen Beatrix and her mother, Juliana, are married to Germans.
Both husbands gained acceptance by learning Dutch and trying to
understand the country, but the Dutch tend to view Germans as
arrogant and authoritarian.
   Resentment of the wartime occupation is largely responsible, and
German tourists who assume everyone speaks their language and
accepts their currency reinforce the attitude.
   Shopkeepers in the border city of Enschede asked West Germans to
stay away May 5, the anniversary of liberation from the Nazis.
   ``We don't think it's appropriate to be confronted with Germans
then, especially for older people who have been through the war,''
a spokesman, B.A. Sassen, told the Amsterdam newspaper De Telegraaf.
   Holland's European Cup soccer victory over West Germany in 1988
inspired much anti-German emotion. Teen-agers born decades after
the war took to the streets chanting ``How the Krauts are silent!''
and ``Revenge at last!''
   A reporter asked a Dutch official at a European Economic
Community meeting in December why his delegation seemed reluctant
to mention World War II.
   ``We have certainly not forgotten the war,'' he said, ``but you
must understand that, with Germany being a major partner, we cannot
say these things publicly. So we let the Russians say them.''

<TEXT>
   The French thought the next war would be as static
as the last and built the Maginot Line to be an impregnable
defense, so the Germans changed the rules and bypassed it with
tanks and planes.
   A generation of officers on both sides learned in World War I
that unprotected infantry had little chance against artillery
barrages and machine-gun fire.
   The French decided they needed fortifications against which
German divisions would hurl themselves until they weakened and
could be driven back. The Germans decided to go around and over
fortifications with new forms of attack: paratroops, dive bombers
and, above all, the battle tank.
   France's line was named for Andre Maginot, defense minister in
1929-32, and stretched along 200 miles of the border with Germany.
   It included artillery protected by concrete 10 feet thick.
Railroad tracks sunk into concrete formed barriers to stop tanks
until gunners could blow them to pieces.
   Many fortifications were underground, connected by a
subterranean railway. Tens of thousands of soldiers could live in
the vast bunkers.
   ``We are always the invaded, we are always the ones who suffer,
we are always the ones to be sacrificed,'' said Maginot, who was
wounded in World War I. He died after eating bad oysters at a New
Year's banquet in 1932.
   His fortifications were strong, but not long enough.
   An agreement made before World War I committed France to defend
Belgium if it was attacked. French politicians felt extending the
line to the English Channel would imply their generals preferred
hiding in bunkers to defending Belgian territory.
   That left a doorway 200 miles wide, including some of the most
tank-friendly country in Europe, if Hitler chose to violate Belgian
neutrality.
   When France and Britain declared war on Germany after it invaded
Poland, most of France's army waited in the Maginot bunkers for a
German attack that never came.
   Nine months of ``phony war'' eroded morale and readiness. A
politician who visited the Maginot Line wrote of being greeted by a
senior officer wearing bedroom slippers.
   French headquarters fell into despair after Belgium and the
Netherlands collapsed. The subsequent evacuation from Dunkirk left
the coastal plains of northern France wide open.
   Field Marshal Heinz Guderian's panzers breached the Somme in
force June 5. Within a week, 49 German divisions had crushed
virtually all defenses in northern and eastern France.
   On June 13, the Wehrmacht turned on the Maginot line and
captured it from the rear. More than 500,000 men were taken
prisoner, most without firing a shot at the enemy, and France
signed an armistice June 22.
   Some of the bunkers now are open to the public, as relics of
military history. Others are used as mushroom farms.

   The automaker and NBC refused to disclose the value of the deal,
but one executive familiar with it and speaking on condition of
anonymity said it was for slightly less than $700 million.
   The agreement involves GM advertising for its cars, trucks and
automotive services on prime-time programs and National Football
League games on the NBC TV network and on the cable networks CNBC

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says Networks Skirting Ad Ban</HEAD>

   A congressman who opposes smoking says
television networks are breaking the law against broadcasting
cigarette advertisements by showing billboards at sports events.
   ``Somewhere someone decided that Congress didn't mean it and
that this is not a statute that is going to be enforced,'' Rep.
Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said Monday. ``Nobody seems to care.
   ``The Justice Department has said in the past they don't believe
it is the best use of scant prosecutorial resources to run these
things down.''
   Luken's comments came after a hearing at which he accused the
networks of colluding with the cigarette industry to skirt the law.
   ``Capital Cities-ABC and RJR Nabisco (makers of Winston, Salem
and Camel cigarettes) jointly own ESPN cable television,'' he said.
``Loews, which owns all of Lorillard Tobacco (makers of Kent,
Newport and True) also owns about 25 percent of CBS.''
   The networks make a lot of money broadcasting sporting events
sponsored by cigarette companies whose logos continually show up on
the screen, said Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials.
   If the TV camera can't avoid the logo, the network shouldn't
broadcast the event, he said.
   Executives from NBC, CBS and ABC all said that displaying
billboards during sports coverage is often unavoidable and they
don't consider it against the ban on television cigarette
advertising that has been in effect since 1971.
   In auto racing, for example, arenas are adorned with ads that
the vehicles continually drive by, said Richard Gitter, NBC vice
president of standards and practices.
   The tobacco companies make the deal to display their logos with
the arena and the network must either accept the event with the
advertising or not broadcast it, said Gitter.
   Alfred Schneider, ABC vice president for policy and standards,
said his network tries to keep such billboards off camera.
   ``The only references to the cigarette company which we permit
are for the purpose of identifying the event by its proper name,''
said Schneider.
   Luken also said the television industry isn't doing enough to
publicize the health hazards of smoking, even when the public
pushes for it.
   He noted that the excise tax on cigarettes in California was
raised on public demand to pay for anti-smoking advertisements on
television.
   ``These ads are controversial, and one network, Capital
Cities-ABC, has refused to run one of these ads,'' Luken said.
   All the executives said their networks had broadcast warnings
about cigarette smoking.
   But Gitter said NBC's priority right now is alcohol and drug
abuse. Schneider said ABC is concentrating on anti-drug abuse and
literacy messages.
   Beth Waxman Bressan, a CBS vice president, said her network fed
affiliates 2,200 public service messages last year on a wide
variety of topics including alcohol abuse, AIDS, the environment
and smoking and health.
   Under questioning from Luken, however, she said she did not know
how many actually aired.

   Prices received by farmers last month rose 0.7
percent from their March average, according to preliminary figures
released by the Agriculture Department.
   The April increase lifted the department's ``prices received''
index 2 percent above the year-earlier average.
   But revisions reported Monday also showed the index has declined
about 2 percent from the record level set in January. A month ago,
preliminary figures for March showed an increase in the price
index. Instead, there was a decline from February to March.
   John Buche of the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service said the downward swing in the March index instead of the
increase initially reported a month ago was due primarily to price
declines for vegetables and some other crops in the last half of
the month.
   Preliminary prices are reported mostly on the basis of mid-month
averages and then updated the following month. Thus, the
preliminary April figures will be revised in the May report.
   According to the latest revisions, the index rose 3.4 percent in
January from its December average before dropping 1.3 percent in
both February and March.
   Prices of raw agricultural products can swing widely during a
single month, and for that reason and others are not considered
reliable indicators by themselves of overall food price trends at
the consumer level.
   Higher prices for oranges, corn, potatoes and cattle were mostly
responsible for the overall price increase from March, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary
report.
   Lower prices for tomatoes, milk, eggs and broilers partly offset
the gains for the other commodities. Most prices are mid-April
averages that will be revised next month.
   New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet
expenses were up 1.1 percent from January and averaged 3.4 percent
more than in April 1989.
   ``Since January, higher prices for feeder pigs and feeder cattle
and calves were moderated by lower fuel and energy prices,'' the
report said.
   Prices of cars and trucks, farm chemicals, tractors and
self-propelled machinery were generally up from last year's
surveys. Most retail seed prices were lower than a year ago.
   USDA economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 may
be in the range of $54 billion to $58 billion, compared with about
$53 billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   Another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $45 billion to $49
billion, compared with $49 billion last year.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA economists to rise 3
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 5.7
percent in 1989, the sharpest rise since 1981.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the April price index for
livestock and poultry dropped 1.2 percent from March but still
averaged 9.7 percent more than a year earlier.
   Milk prices dropped an additional 60 cents in April to an
average of $13.10 per l00 pounds. Even so, the preliminary April
price was up 70 cents from April 1989. The farm price of milk rose
to a record $16 per hundredweight in December.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 3.1 percent from March but averaged 7
percent below the year-earlier level. Fruit prices, led by oranges
and grapefruit, were up 11 percent from March and by the same
margin of 11 percent from a year ago.
   The index for commercial vegetables dropped 13 percent from
March and averaged 28 percent below the year-earlier level,
reflecting abundant tomato supplies and low prices.
   Tomato prices were reported at $16 per 100 pounds, down from
$32.80 in March and $55.80 in April 1989. Onions, however, rose to
$23 per 100 pounds from $19.60 in March and $10.90 a year earlier.
   Prices of potatoes and dry beans, which are measured
collectively, increased 14 percent from March to April and were up
13 percent from a year earlier.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $75 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally,
up from $74.20 in March and $70.10 in April 1989. Those are
averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $52.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $51.30 in
March and $36.90 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.52 a bushel, was up from $2.37 in March but was
just short of the $2.56 year-earlier average.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.51 per bushel, compared with $3.49 in March and $4.03 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.26 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.50 in
March and $6.74 in April 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.62 per bushel, compared with $5.65 in March
and $7.29 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 64.8 cents per pound, up from
64.1 in March and 58.7 a year earlier.
   _Eggs were 71.4 cents per dozen, compared with 79.3 in March and
66.1 in April 1989.
   _Milk was $13.10 per 100 pounds, down from $13.70 in March but
above the average of $12.40 a year ago.
   _Broilers were 33.2 cents per pound, live weight, down from 36.4
cents in March and from 39.1 cents a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   The Bank of Japan announced a major restructuring
Tuesday aimed at strengthening the central bank's monetary
operations and its ability to monitor financial institutions at
home and abroad.
   The reorganization, which goes into effect on May 28, will
reduce the number of departments at the central bank from 18 to 16.
   The reorganization is designed to help the Bank of Japan better
cope with the continued globalization of financial markets.
   The central bank said it will set up a ``market operations''
division to monitor both money and capital markets and to execute
daily monetary operations in a comprehensive manner.
   The central bank said two divisions _ the bank relations
division and the capital markets division _ will ``oversee the
activities of financial institutions both at home and abroad in
their daily monitoring of banks and securities houses,
respectively.''
   In addition, the central bank said a new financial and payment
system department will be set up to cope with the increased risks
to the financial system posed by the trends toward financial
deregulation, globalization and computerization.
   A new international department will combine the current foreign
department with the overseas research function of the research and
statistics department.
   To expand the central bank's international network, the Hong
Kong office will be made the Bank of Japan's third chief
representative office serving Asia and Oceania, joining New York
for North and South America, and London for Europe, Africa and the
Middle East.
   Another representative office will be added to Washington, D.C.,
bringing the number of representative offices to six.

<TEXT>
   Baxter International Inc., a hospital supply
company that was on the Arab League's blacklist, was taken off the
list after selling a plant in Israel and opening another in Syria,
a newspaper reported today.
   Baxter executives have denied that the company sought to curry
favor from the League by selling the plant in Israel, a move that
would violate a U.S. law forbidding American companies from
participating in a foreign boycott, The Wall Street Journal said.
   The plants in Israel and Syria both synthesize intravenous body
fluids.
   Jewish leaders are demanding an explanation from Baxter.
   A memorandum on file in the Arab League's boycott office in the
Syrian capitol of Damascus suggests the sale and the delisting were
linked, the newspaper said.
   A Washington businessman and former Baxter official, Dr. Richard
Fuisz, gave the Journal a copy of the memo and documents about
Baxter's Middle East operations.
   Fuisz had sent another memo copy to the Baxter directors.
   The memo says Baxter sought removal from the blacklist through
its Swiss subsidiary, Baxter AG. It also says that another
subsidiary, International Medical Technologies, provided
documentation of the sale of Baxter's Israel plant and promised not
to do any more business with Israel, the Journal reported.
   Baxter senior vice president and general counsel, G. Marshall
Abbey, said International Medical Technologies did not supply
information directly to the League's committee. He also said the
company has not violated the law.
   The company said it never contacted the boycott committee to ask
to be taken off the list, the Journal said.
   Abbey said the directors' audit committee has hired a lawyer
from the New York firm of Calwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft to conduct
an independent investigation.
   Neither the Commerce Department nor the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which are reviewing the company's Middle East
activities, would comment.
   Jess N. Hordes, Washington director of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith, said the circumstances ``raise serious
questions about the process Baxter went through'' in getting off
the blacklist.

   Prices moved higher in early trading on Wall
Street today as momentum from Monday's rallied carried over to
another session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.31 to 2,672.07
at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 5
to 2, with 687 stocks up, 289 down and 463 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.45 million shares after the
first half-hour of trading.
   Analysts said today's gains came on the heels of a late rally on
Monday, when the Dow Jones industrial average closed nearly 12
points higher.
   A somewhat better-than-expected earnings report from Chrysler
Corp. today also gave prices a lift. The automaker's own stock was
up ~ to 15&rsqb;.
   All the financial markets were awaiting the results of the April
survey on the economy by the National Association of Purchasing
Management. The report, which measures activity in the
manufacturing sector, has affected trading in recent months and was
expected to have some impact on stock prices today.
   The most-active issue on the NYSE was Boeing, up 1{ to 71\.
   Other early gainers included AMR, up 1&lsqb; to 63{, and IBM, which
rose &rsqb; to 109&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.82 to 182.31. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 0.60 to 343.70.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.71 to
2,656.76.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE,
with 727 up, 735 down and 498 unchanged.
   Big Board volume hit a three-week low of 122.75 million shares,
down from 130.63 million Friday.

<HEAD>Chrysler First-Quarter Earnings Down 80 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said today its earnings tumbled 80
percent during the first quarter as it wrestled with budget cuts,
heavy incentive costs and slumping market share.
   The No. 3 automaker said it earned $71 million, or 32 cents a
share during the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of
$351 million, or $1.50 a share in the year-ago period.
   The earnings came on revenues of $7.56 billion, down 22 percent
from $9.66 billion reported in the first quarter of last year.
   Chrysler's stock slipped 25 cents a share to close at a 52-week
low of $14.50 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading on Monday.
Wall Street analysts had predicted marginal earnings for the
company.
   No. 1 General Motors Corp. and No. 2 Ford Motor Co. are expected
to report first-quarter earnings later this week.
   ``We posted a profit in our automotive operations despite lower
volumes and incentive costs nearly double what they were a year
ago,'' Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said in a statement.
   In January, Chrysler offered a first-time, $1,000 incentive on
its popular minivans. That offer pumped up sales of the most
popular line of minivans in the United States, but ate into profits.
   At the end of the first quarter, Chrysler held 11.4 percent of
the domestic car market, down from 12.9 percent a year earlier.
   Through the end of March, automakers had sold about 1.7 million
domestically made cars, a 1.3 percent decline from a year earlier.
   Chrysler is in the midst of a $1.5-billion cost-cutting program,
which Iacocca said is aiding profitability. The earnings statement
did not disclose how much of the cost-cutting target has been
realized, but Chrysler officials have said the bulk of the cuts
were made shortly after the program began in October. It should be
completed by the end of this year.
   Chrysler Financial Corp., which handles the automaker's consumer
and dealer financing and insurance among other things, reported an
$89 million profit, up from $86 million posted during the fourth
quarter of last year.
   As a whole, the corporation lost $664 million during the final
quarter of 1989, mostly because of a $577 million one-time charge
for plant closings, discontinuation of some cars and pension and
severance expenses under the cost-cutting program.
   The company also said today that it had $1.85 billion in cash
and cash equivalents on hand at the end of March, down from $2.01
billion last year.
   During the first quarter, Chrysler bought about 1.4 million
shares of its own stock in efforts to reduce the number of
outstanding shares to 200 million. At the end of the quarter there
were 221.4 million shares of common stock outstanding, the company
said.

   Construction spending fell in March for the
first time this year, the government said today, down 1.4 percent
as the weather returned to normal and mortgage interest rates
continued to rise.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $432.5 billion after jumps of 3.2 percent in
February and 2.4 percent in January.
   The decline was the largest since a 1.5 percent fall in February
1989.
   Despite the drop, spending was 3.8 percent above that of March
1989, when it totaled $416.8 billion.
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, had said after the February report that construction
spending would begin to lose its seasonal benefit in March.
   ``We expect it to start leveling off, if not decline, because it
will no longer have the seasonal boost and also because of
increasing interest rates,'' he said.
   After the fourth coldest December on record, January broke the
record as the warmest. February also was unseasonably warm and
temperatures during both months induced builders to get
construction under way early.
   Mortgage rates, which started the year in the single digits,
ranged between 10.22 percent and 10.34 percent during March, when
temperatures also returned to normal.
   Residential building continued to rise in March, up 1.8 percent
to an annual rate of $203.2 billion on top of gains of 1.5 percent
in February and 3.8 percent in January.
   Single-family building edged up 0.2 percent to $122.5 billion
after a 3.6 percent advance in February and a 2.3 percent gain a
month earlier. Apartment construction was unchanged at $20.7
billion after falling 2.4 percent in February and 1.0 percent the
previous month.
   Non-residential building also was off, down 4.7 percent to
$101.1 billion after gains of 5.8 percent in February and 5.5
percent in January.
   The volatile government sector dropped 4.8 percent to $90.7
billion after rising 5.0 percent in February and falling 3.2
percent in January. Spending on highways and streets was down 11.8
percent.

   Stock prices were higher but giving back some of
their gains today after the monthly purchasing managers report
revived fears of higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 6.75 to 2,663.51
at 11 a.m. EDT after having been up more than 15 points in earlier
trading.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 6
to 5, with 659 stocks up, 537 down and 510 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.5 million shares after the
first 90 minutes of trading.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the economy in the manufacturing sector by polling its members,
said its index rose to 50.2 percent in April from 48.8 percent the
previous month.
   The news reawakened concerns in the financial markets that a
stronger economy would allow inflation to accelerate, and that the
Federal Reserve would in turn push interest rates higher.
   Bond prices, which had been up in early trading, fell in
response to the purchasing managers report, and the stock market

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge; Thin Market Cited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged this morning on the
Chicago Board of Trade, leading the grain markets higher in a rally
that reflected thin market conditions due to the May Day holiday in
Europe.
   With the early spurt, the soybean market resumed the upward
trend that characterized the market last week amid signs of slow
Brazilian soybean exports and fears of a hot, dry summer in the
Midwest.
   Those factors have been largely discounted, though, and analysts
said today's surge suggests few players are willing to sell a
market that has recently been so strong.
   ``There's a vacuum of sellers at the moment _ that's the best
explanation you can give,'' said Anne Frick, senior oilseeds
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Frick also noted that many overseas markets are closed today for
May Day, making for thin trading conditions and increased
volatility.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to 5{ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.73{ a bushel;
corn was { cent to 2} cents higher with May at $2.84 a bushel; oats
were { cent to 1} cents higher with May at $1.66 a bushel; soybeans
were 8 cents to 12{ cents higher with May at $6.45 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange with pork bellies up the permitted
daily limit of 2 cents a pound on bullish chart signals.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .42 cent higher with June at 73.35
cents a pound; feeder cattle .02 cent to .40 cent higher with May
at 82.87 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent to .73 cent higher
with June at 63.85 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .18 cent
to the limit 2 cents higher with May at 68.65 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Monday. Pork futures were mostly
higher, led by the pork bellies.

<TEXT>
   President Bush wants Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman to resign, The Washington Post
reported today, quoting unnamed administration sources.
   Bush, in a meeting with the top S&amp;L bailout official two weeks
ago, reportedly suggested now would be a good time for the 69-year
old Seidman to leave, the newspaper said. He had been appointed by
President Reagan in 1985 and his term expires in 1991.
   Seidman, in a telephone interview from Michigan, declined to
comment on the story today and said he had promised not to divulge
what he discussed with the president. However, he noted that in the
past he has said he planned to leave his post after getting the
bailout agency off to a good start.
   A month ago, he announced ambitious plans to sell or close 140
S&amp;Ls by the end of June and, Seidman said today, ``That would be a
good start.''
   An industry source, who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity, said White House officials confirmed that
they would not stand in Seidman's way if he leaves.
   The chairman of the FDIC serves independently and cannot be
fired by the president. But the Post, quoting ``two administration
sources familiar with the meeting,'' said Bush wants to name his
own chairman.
   ``It's no secret we would not be upset if he leaves. It's not
like we're trying to talk him into staying,'' the newspaper quoted
a source present at the meeting as saying.
   White House press spokesmen did not immediately respond to a
request for comment.
   Seidman, who enjoys strong support from both Democrats and
Republicans in Congress, has been dropping hints for nearly a year
that he would not serve out his term.
   He has feuded with Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson and
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu over the conduct of the
bailout. However, he also has given no indication of leaving
immediately.
   The chairman of the FDIC is considered the most powerful banking
regulator, although the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has
more influence over the economy.
   The five-member FDIC board administers deposit insurance funds
for both commercial banks and savings and loans. The agency is the
chief federal regulator of state-chartered banks and back-up
regulator of S&amp;Ls and federally-chartered banks. The board also
manages the Resolution Trust Corp., which supervises the sale and
closing of insolvent thrifts.
   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of America, said a leading candidate to replace
Seidman is Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke. Clarke's
office regulates national banks and he sits on the FDIC board.

   Stock prices were little changed today after the
monthly purchasing managers report on the economy revived fears of
higher interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.73 to 2,661.49
at noon EDT after having been up more than 15 points in earlier
trading.
   Advancing issues were even with decliners, with 648 stocks up,
644 down and 509 unchanged on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 76.92 million shares at midday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the economy in the manufacturing sector by surveying its members
each month, said its index rose to 50.2 percent in April from 48.8
percent in March.
   The news reawakened concerns in the financial markets that a
stronger economy would allow inflation to accelerate, and that the
Federal Reserve would in turn push interest rates higher.
   Bond prices, which had been up in early trading, surrendered
their gains in response to the purchasing managers report, and the
stock market followed suit.
   At midday, the Treasury's closely-watched 30-year bond was off
$5 for each $1,000 in face value, while its yield, which is a
harbinger of market interest rates, was up to 9.05 percent from
8.99 late Monday.
   Chase Manhattan led the NYSE's most active list, falling \ to
25&lsqb;.
   First-quarter earnings gave the market a few bright spots.
   Chrysler rose } to 15\ after issuing a somewhat

<HEAD>Investors Aiming for Two Directors on Texas Air's Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group that holds a large chunk of Texas Air
Corp. bonds said it plans to elect two additional directors to the
company's board after it failed to pay a dividend for six quarters
in a row.
   PaineWebber Inc., which holds about 30 percent of Texas Air's
6.75 percent junior preferred stock, said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that it will exercise
its right to add two directors to the 11-member board.
   The director rule takes effect after six consecutive dividends
are missed, according to Texas Air, parent of Eastern Airlines and
Continental Airlines.
   PaineWebber is the second party to give such notice to the SEC.
Last week, Mark Schwarzman, a Connecticut investor, said he
controls 6.8 percent of the same class of preferred stock and may
seek representation on the board.
   Analysts said the continued non-payment of dividends would have
little effect on the already low-rated debt.
   Texas Air's own financial picture is overshadowed by troubles at
its Eastern subsidiary. A federal bankruptcy judge recently
appointed a special trustee to take control of Miami-based Eastern
away from Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   In a recent financial report, Texas Air said it had not paid
dividends on three of its four preferred stock issues since the
third quarter of 1988. At the end of 1989, the airline company
reported it was $25.3 million behind on payment of its preferred
dividends.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said Monday the company will
propose its slate of directors by May 7, the mailing deadline for
proxy statements to be sent to shareholders. Texas Air's annual
meeting is scheduled for June 6.
   Houston-based Continental reported first-quarter earnings Monday
of $21.3 million, compared with a net loss of $16.5 million in the
same period in 1989.
   Continental normally reports its earnings as part of the
quarterly financial statement of Texas Air. But Kent said Texas
Air's financial report was being delayed while company officials
assess the effect of the bankruptcy judge's decision to shift
control of Eastern.

<HEAD>Partnership Seeking to Install Own Nominees on Pic 'N' Save Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A partnership interested in taking over Pic 'N' Save Corp. said
Tuesday it has started the process of trying to have its own
nominees elected to the retailer's board of directors.
   Girard Partners, a Texas limited partnership, said it is seeking
``to remove five of the seven incumbent directors of the company,
to elect three nominees of the partnership to constitute a majority
of the board and to adopt a stockholder resolution to facilitate
that effort.''
   The group said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it has begun soliciting proxies from the retail
chain's shareholders.
   Representatives of Girard Partners met with Pic 'N' Save on
April 28, the filing said. The partnership representatives said at
the meeting that ``they believe a sale of the company is the most
desirable alternative'' to nhance value to stockholders.
   At the meeting, the partnership ``delivered a letter requesting
that it be granted access to nonpublic financial and other
information'' regarding Pic 'N' Save ``in connection with
formulating an acquisition proposal, and stating that it would be
willing to enter into appropriate confidentiality arrangements ...''
   The filing made no reference to the size of Girard Partners'
stake in Pic 'N' Save stock. In an April 11 SEC filing, the
partnership had said it owned 6.6 percent of Pic 'N' Save and
planned a takeover bid for the close-out chain.
   Girard Partners is led by David H. Batchelder, who served as T.
Boone Pickens chief strategist until 1988. Another member of the
group is Robert H. McNulty, president and chief executive of the HQ
Office Supplies Warehouse retail chain and a founder of the Home
Club chain.
   The April 11 filing said Girard Partners would seek control of
the Pic 'N' Save board.
   Pic 'N' Save, based in the Dominguez suburb of Los Angeles, had
about $400 million in sales last year and has about 5,000
employees. It buys manufacturers' close-out merchandise and sells
it at deep discounts to customers.

<HEAD>Inside Trader Recounts Downfall in Magazine Article</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 4:30 pm EDT, time set by source</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Admitted inside trader Dennis Levine, whose
arrest led to the fall of Ivan Boesky and other Wall Street
figures, said his values eroded in the deal-crazy 1980s, when
million-dollar profits seemed ``insignificant.''
   ``I will regret my mistakes forever,'' the former investment
banker said in a first-person article in the May 21 issue of
Fortune magazine, which was released Tuesday.
   ``No one led me down the garden path,'' Levine said. ``... For
the hard work and creativity I brought to my investment banking
career, I was well rewarded. When I broke the law, I was punished.
The system works.''
   It was Levine's first public comment on the illegal dealings
that ended with his 1986 arrest since he was released from federal
prison last year. Levine repeatedly has refused interview requests.
   Levine has set up his own mergers and acquisitions advisory firm
and has lectured on ethics at top business schools including
Columbia and New York universities and the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   A Fortune spokeswoman said Levine was paid to write the article.
She declined to specify the amount but said it was a ``normal
freelance fee.''
   In the article, a repentant Levine traces his rise from a
middle-class Queens, N.Y., neighborhood to a managing director's
suite at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., from which he helped major
takeover deals.
   Levine was involved in some of the 1980s biggest deals,
including Ronald Perelman's takeover of Revlon Inc. and Carl
Icahn's proxy fight against Phillips Petroleum Co.
   ``The daily exposure to such deals, the pursuit of larger and
larger transactions and the numbing effect of 60- to 100-hour work
weeks helped erode my values and distort my judgment,'' Levine said.
   ``In this unbelieveable world of billions and billions of
dollars, the millions I made by trading on nonpublic information
seemed almost insignificant,'' he said.
   In his illicit dealings, Levine parlayed $39,750 _ much of it
borrowed from family members _ into $11.5 million over seven years
using illegal tips on upcoming deals. He set up offshore bank
accounts and left instructions on how his trades were to be handled
to avoid detection.
   Levine had a network of sophisticated insiders with whom he
would swap deal information. Levine said Boesky, the former stock
speculator, would call him at home ``well before 6 a.m.'' to ferret
out information before trading.
   Levine said he would have gotten $2.4 million for supplying
Boesky with information, but ``never received a penny'' because he
was arrested first. Levine served 15 months in a federal prison
camp in Pennsylvania.
   Using information supplied by Levine, federal investigators
nailed Boesky, who paid $100 million in penalties and pleaded
guilty to one felony to settle insider trading charges. Boesky was
released from federal custody in April after serving two years of a
three-year term.
   Levine said his scheme began crumbling when several bank
executives were detected mimicking his trades, which were executed
via a Swiss bank in the Bahamas.
   With the government in hot pursuit, Levine said he drove around
Manhattan in his BMW, frantically calling his family and lining up
an attorney on the car phone. His unsuspecting wife, Laurie, was
``furious,'' he said.
   Pleading guilty to four criminal charges before a federal judge
was a ``humbling experience,'' perhaps as difficult as watching his
daughter learn to walk in a prison waiting room, he said.
   Levine said he has formed Adasar Group, an advisory firm he
named after his children, Adam and Sarah. Though barred for life
from working for a securities firm, Levine is allowed to advise
companies.
   Levine said his clients are ``smaller than they used to be,''
but he said his re-entry into the business world has been met with
``fairness and compassion.''
   The magazine hits newsstands Monday.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Break After Strong Rally; Grains Follow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
mostly lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by a late
break in the soybean market after a technically inspired rally
drove prices to new nine-month highs.
   The heavy trading volume and whipsaw action recalled the drought
summer of 1988, when soybean prices swung wildly after each new bit
of weather data, said Jerry Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine
Corp.'s floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   But unlike two years ago, Tuesday's rally was driven almost
entirely by bullish technical patterns, he said.
   ``I haven't heard any good fundamental explanations for why we
ran up,'' Zusel said.
   Soybeans for May delivery touched $6.55 a bushel, the highest
price for a near-month soybean contract since July 28, before the
rally ran out of steam.
   ``The buying dried up, the selling picked up and the lower you
got the more selling you ran into,'' Zusel said.
   He said the grain markets basically followed soybeans higher,
then retreated as soybean prices fell.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 6\ cents lower to 2{
cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.68 a
bushel; corn was 2\ cents lower to 3 cents higher with May at $2.84
a bushel; oats were } cent to 1} cents lower with May at $1.63{ a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with May at $6.29 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Survey Says Manufacturing Sector Showed Slight Growth In April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. industrial sector expanded slightly
during April for the first time in a year, led by sharp gains in
new orders and exports, the nation's purchasing managers said in a
survey released Tuesday.
   Economists said last month's data, although stronger than
expected, hardly pointed to an economic rebound. Most of the
surveyed manufacturers remained reluctant to add new jobs or expand
their inventories, they said.
   In addition, a government report released Tuesday showed the
recent rise in interest rates was depressing construction, a major
component of economic growth. Spending for residential,
non-residential and government building fell 1.4 percent in March
to a 13-month low, the Commerce Department said.
   ``I still think we're dealing with an economy that is kind of
sputtering,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for
Nikko Securities Co. International. ``It may not look like a
recession but you have to draw the line well short of calling it
vibrant.''
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its
economic index rose to 50.2 percent in April from 48.8 percent the
previous month. A reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing
economy generally is expanding; below 50, that it is generally
contracting.
   The April reading followed 11 straight monthly declines and was
the highest since last April's 52.7 percent level, the group said
in a news release from its Tempe, Ariz., headquarters.
   The index has averaged 48.1 percent for the first four months of
1990, consistent with a 1.3 percent rise in the gross national
product, the group said.
   Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the trade group's business survey
committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes
Inc., said the improvement reflected a significant gain in new
orders, particularly in exports.
   ``The rebound should be sufficient to sustain solid production
growth for several months and buoy the entire economy over the
balance of the second quarter,'' he said.
   Some economists weren't as optimistic.
   ``We think growth in the second quarter could be less than it
was in the first,'' said Carol Stone, a senior economist for Nomura
Securities Inc. ``Businesses are still showing a cautious
attitude.''
   Stone said manufacturers have kept their inventories low and
have been reluctant to permanantly fill jobs.
   Brusca said a significant portion of the growth reported in the
April purchasing managers' report came from the volatile automobile
sector.
   The report said new orders expanded for the third consecutive
month during April. The new orders index jumped to 55.5 percent
from 50.4 percent in March.
   New export orders were up for the 28th consecutive month, as the
seasonally unadjusted index rose to 60.5 percent from 59.5 percent.
The report said 74 percent of the group's members exported last
month, up from 71 percent in March and a three year high.
   Imports increased for the fourth consecutive month but at a
slower pace than March. Seventy-six percent of all members imported
in April, down from 78 percent, the group said.
   The production portion of the survey gained ground for the third
consecutive month during April, although growth was at a slower
level than the previous month _ 53 percent vs. 54.4 percent.
   Declining for the 14th consecutive month was the employment
portion of the survey, with the index falling to 45.1 percent from
45.2 percent. Members continued to report they were hiring
temporary workers and working overtime to handle increasing
production activity rather than hiring new employees, the group
said.
   Inventories weakened for the 17th straight month. That index was
unchanged from March at 41.6 percent _ the second-lowest level
since December 1986.
   Supplier deliveries were faster in April for the 12th
consecutive month. But 12 commodities were in short supply,
including bearings, electric motors, timber and some chemicals, the
group said.
   Meanwhile, prices of goods rose after falling for 10 consecutive
months. About 17 commodities had higher prices, up from 11 in
March, the group said.
   The purchasing managers' report is based on a monthly survey of
purchasing executives at over 300 industrial companies. Most of the
figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.

<HEAD>Infant Formula Measure Loses But Will Stay on Agenda</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bristol Myers-Squibb Co. shareholders on
Tuesday overwhelmingly defeated a proposal that would have banned
the consumer products giant from peddling infant formula directly
to the public.
   But the measure received enough votes to remain on the agenda
next year.
   The infant formula resolution, sponsored by 11 religious
investors and supported by many pediatricians, received 16.56
million votes, or 4.9 percent of the total, at the company's annual
meeting in Wilmington.
   More than 320.9 million votes were cast against, with 31.12
million absentions. The measure needed to gain at least 3 percent
of the votes to remain on the ballot at the next annual meeting.
   A substantial part of the three-hour meeting was dominated by
debate over the infant-formula resolution, which has aroused
considerable interest as a contentious shareholder activist issue
in the 1990 annual meeting season.
   The measure's supporters said Bristol Myers-Squibb is misleading
the public by suggesting that its infant formula, marketed though
Gerber Products Co., is as nutritious as breast milk.
   They say it departs from the industry tradition of promoting
formula only to physicians. Since last October, television ads for
the formula end with the phrase, ``If it doesn't come from you,
shouldn't it come from Gerber?''
   ``How can you persist in this commercially driven charade?''
said Dr. Frank A. Oski, chairman of the department of pediatrics at
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and a representative of the
American Academy of Pediatrics.
   He urged adoption of the resolution, which would make Bristol
Myers-Squibb and Gerber stop marketing the formula directly to
mothers.
   Richard Gelb, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, defended the marketing campaign by saying the
advertisements make it clear that breast milk is superior to baby
formula.
   ``We support breastfeeding as we have said, but we don't believe
it's quite as cut and dried,'' Gelb told reporters after the
meeting concluded.
   Shareholders also defeated measures that would have forced the
company to provide information about animal testing, sever all ties
to South Africa and create one-year terms for directors.
   Bristol Myers-Squibb, based in New York, is the result of the
merger of the Bristol Myers and Squibb companies last year. It is
the nation's 50th largest industrial corporation with revenue of
more than $9.4 billion in 1989.

   Prices advanced on Wall Street today as the
stock market shrugged off an economic report that raised the
specter of higher interest rates.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks
the economy in the manufacturing sector by surveying its members
each month, said its index rose to 50.2 percent in April from 48.8
percent in March. A reading above 50 generally indicates the
economy is expanding.
   The news reawakened concerns in the financial markets that a
stronger economy would allow inflation to accelerate, forcing the
Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher.
   Bond prices, which had been up in early trading, surrendered
their gains in response to the purchasing managers report, and the
stock market initially followed suit.
   However, during the afternoon, blue chip issues regained ground
and secondary stocks then caught on. Analysts said Wall Street was
repeating what is becoming a classic performance _ losing ground
after a negative report and then recovering as traders have second
thoughts about how bad the news really is.

<HEAD>Profits, Sales Up at Emerson Electric</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emerson Electric Co. said Tuesday that profits
and sales both rose 5.6 percent in its second quarter, but that
earnings were reduced because of the company's guilty plea to
overcharging the Pentagon.
   The increases came from continued strength in Emerson's capital
goods markets, which include assembly line machines, motors and
drives, and gains made by various foreign subsidiaries and in
overseas sales, the company said.
   Profits for the period ending March 31 were $156 million, or 70
cents a share, up from $148 million, or 66 cents a share, in the
second quarter of 1989.
   Sales were $1.9 billion, up from $1.8 billion for the same
period in 1989.
   Emerson officials said earnings were reduced by more than $14
million because of Tuesday's guilty plea to making inflated cost
estimates for electronic equipment it sold to the Pentagon.
   The settlement, which included a $40,000 fine and a $14 million
civil settlement, is about twice the amount that Emerson's
subsidiary, Electronics &amp; Space Corp., overcharged the Pentagon
from 1983 to 1987.
   The guilty pleas to four counts of filing false statements ended
a two-year investigation by the U.S. Attorney's office in St.
Louis, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense
Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Logistics Agency.
   ``The settlement ... resolves a number of open issues, many of
which preceded the investigation,'' company chairman and chief
executive Charles Knight said in a statement.
   Emerson owns companies that make tools for Sears Roebuck Co.,
Skil power tools, ceiling fans, ladders and other products. The
company is also a leading supplier of compressors for
refrigerators, computer power systems and electric motors.
   For the first six months of 1990, Emerson's profits were $298
million, or $1.34 a share, up 4.7 percent from $285 million, or
$1.27 a share, for the first six months of 1989.
   Sales for the first half were flat, $3.55 billion this year vs.
$3.52 billion last year.
   ``Our capital goods-related businesses have record level
backlogs and expect continued good sales performance, as do our
international operations,'' Knight said.
   ``We are concerned, however, about the prospects for rising
interest rates and softness in the domestic economy which will
continue to impact our consumer-related businesses,'' he said.

<HEAD>Union Texas Petroleum May Go on Block</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc. is
considering putting itself on the auction block or taking other
action to enhance the value of the nation's second-largest
independent oil company.
   If sold, analysts say, the company could fetch $2.25 billion.
   The announcement Monday of a possible sale came after Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a leveraged buyout specialist, said it may
sell its 40 percent holding in Union Texas Petroleum.
   If the oil company is sold for $25 a share, Kohlberg Kravis
could earn a profit of about $750 million on stock it bought five
years ago for $7.50 a share. Analysts speculated that Kohlberg
Kravis agreed to the sale because it needs to shore up some souring
investments.
   Kohlberg Kravis owns Safeway, Duracell and RJR Nabisco, which it
took private last year in a $25 billion leveraged buyout, the
largest in history.
   Allied Signal Inc., an aerospace and automotive parts
conglomerate which owns 40 percent of Union Texas Petroleum, has
previously said it wanted to sell its holding in the oil company.
   If it decides to put itself up for sale, Union Texas Petroleum
said it does not expect the sale to be completed before November.
   A sale could mean lost jobs for many of the company's 1,900
employees, including 900 in Houston, if a major oil company buys it
and consolidates operations or if Union Texas Petroleum assets are
sold separately.
   High prices paid recently for oil and natural gas assets are the
key to the board of directors' decision, said Carol L. Cox, a
spokeswoman for Union Texas Petroleum.
   Houston oilman Roy M. Huffington last month sold his extensive
Indonesian natural gas interests for an estimated $600 million to
an affiliate of Taiwan's national oil company. The deal also
included about $50 million in Houston real estate.
   Huffington was a partner with Union Texas Petroleum in an
Indonesian partnership that is the largest gas producer in
Indonesia _ one of the hottest exploration areas in the world.
Union Texas Petroleum owns about 38 percent of the partnership.
   Union Texas Petroleum also has crude oil production and
exploration operations in the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and
a 42 percent interest and joint operation of an ethylene plant in
Geismar, La.

   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said Tuesday it
was eliminating 20 of the 30 jobs in its British equities operation
due to deteriorating trading conditions for London securities.
   ``Market conditions in the United Kingdom have quite simply

   The job losses will be spread among sales, trading and research

   The firm said it will retain a sales and trading capacity in its
London office and will continue as a market maker in some British

   Chevron U.S.A. Inc. said Tuesday it has
agreed to sell certain Gulf of Mexico oil reserves for about $150
million to a New Orleans-based partnership.
   Chevron U.S.A., the domestic oil and gas subsidiary of Chevron
Corp., said it will sell its Main Pass 299 shallow oil reserves to
avoid the costs and other problems tied to co-development of oil,
gas and sulphur resources.
   The reserves, estimated at 35 million to 50 million barrels of
oil, will be bought by Freeport-McMoran Resource Partners Limited
Partnership, an affiliate of Freeport-McMoran Inc.
   Chevron U.S.A. said it will receive $137 million, plus
reimbursement for about $13 million in costs connected with the
development of the reserves. A final contract is expected by the
end of the second quarter, the company said.
   The reserves are located about 90 miles southeast of New
Orleans, in the same reservoir as Freeport-McMoran Resource
Partners' sulphur reserves.
   Chevron said it will continue its oil and gas operations on
other portions of the reserve. The company also has the right,
under certain circumstances, to take part in proceeds of future
production if the price of volumes exceed certain levels.
   Frank Robin, eastern region vice president for Chevron U.S.A.,
said the sale agreement is not related to previously announced
asset sales by the corporation.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said Tuesday its first quarter
profit tumbled 79.8 percent from last year, and Wall Street
analysts said that without a company cost-cutting program the slide
would have been even worse.
   A slumping auto market and the soaring costs of incentives aimed
at reviving sales helped push Chrysler's net income down to $71
million, or 32 cents a share, in the first three months of the year.
   That was down from $351 million, or $1.50 a share, in the
year-earlier quarter but it bettered analyst estimates that
Chrysler earnings would be around the break-even point.
   ``It shows the leanness and meanness of management hammering
home on the cost-cutting front,'' auto analyst John Kirnan of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York said of the earnings report.
   First-quarter revenue dropped to $7.56 billion from $9.66
billion in the same period last year.
   Chrysler stock finished up 75 cents at $15.25 a share Tuesday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Monday's close had been a 52-week low.
   Last October, Chrysler began a program to slice $1.5 billion
from its $26 billion annual budget by the end of this year, partly
by eliminating about 2,500 white-collar jobs.
   Some of the expense stemming from the cuts, such as severance
pay, was written off in the fourth quarter. Chrysler lost $664
million during that quarter due largely to a $577 million writeoff
that covered plant closings and some of the cost-cutting expenses.
   Analysts have predicted that earnings would fall more than 75
percent for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which report
their results later this week.
   Chrysler appears to be heading toward its cost-cutting target,
analysts said, estimating the automaker had cut $200 million in
costs during the first quarter.
   In a statement, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said the company's
cost cutting ``is certain to become a major competitive advantage
for Chrysler.''
   He said the company spent nearly twice as much on buyer
incentives in the first quarter than it did a year ago. Chrysler
offered a $1,000 rebate on its popular minivans during January, the
first time for an incentive on the vehicles.
   That boosted the sales rate for minivans but cut into profits.
Furthermore, since the January sales surge sales of Chrysler's cars
and trucks, including minivans, have nosedived.
   Through the first quarter of the year, Chrysler's domestic car
and truck sales were 5.6 percent behind last year's pace.
   Despite that, analysts said they were encouraged by the
long-range effects of the company's budget-cutting program.
   ``I think it is encouraging to see how successful management has
been in controlling costs,'' Kirnan said. ``People still want to
see the product side improve.''
   Chrysler's next major product change comes to market in the fall
when the company's new minivans hit dealer showrooms. Chrysler
derives much of its profit from minivan sales.
   This summer, Chrysler will be shutting down both of its minivan
assembly plants for four weeks apiece for retooling. That could
spell trouble for the company's second- and third-quarter profits.
   ``I would not be surprised to see a red number for the third
quarter,'' said analyst David Healy of Barclays-BZW of New York,
``but the second quarter should be profitable, probably a good bit
better than the first quarter.''
   The company said its Chrysler Financial Corp. subsidiary posted
an $89 million profit for the first quarter, up from $86 million in
the fourth quarter of last year.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices strengthened Tuesday,
pumped up by a moderate rally in refined oil products. Analysts
said traders bought in case any bullish news emerges from an OPEC
meeting Wednesday.
   In addition to precautionary buying, prices were pushed aloft by
demand in the spot market for gasoline, which spurred buying in the
gas pits on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``It was a product-led rally today,'' said Jerry Samuels, a vice
president and energy broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``It was
not heavy volume.''
   The contract for June delivery of unleaded regular gasoline
jumped 1.19 cents to 61.03 cents a gallon after slipping 0.33 cent
on Monday. Contracts for later delivery also posted significant
gains. The May contract expired Monday.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Merc, home
heating oil for June delivery advanced 1.52 cents to 52.97 cents a
gallon following Monday's rise of 0.70 cent. Subsequent contracts
ended with slightly smaller gains.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 27 cents to settle at $18.81 a
42-gallon barrel. The contract had ended unchanged Monday at
$18.54. Contracts for delivery during July through September
finished 20 cents to 25 cents higher.
   Natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.565 per million
British thermal units, the same settlement price as Monday. Later
months finished with minor gains and losses.
   The OPEC meeting Wednesday preoccupied oil traders. As ministers
gathered in Geneva for the emergency session, the cartel's
president said OPEC might need to cut output by as much as 1.5
million barrels a day to shore up sagging world crude prices.
   The cartel's president, Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena,
called the meeting to discuss curbing production. Prices have
dropped by more than 20 percent since January.
   Energy analysts doubt OPEC will achieve enough of a production
cutback to have a significant impact on prices.
   Gasoline demand, meanwhile, firmed at cash markets on the Gulf
Coast and in the Houston area reflecting temporary needs of
refiners, Samuels said. This boosted futures buying interest.

   OPEC needs cut to oil production by as much as 1.5
million barrels a day to help crude prices recover from their
recent slide, OPEC's president said Tuesday as cartel ministers
arrived for an emergency meeting.
   The cartel's president, Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena,
called the meeting for Wednesday to try to curb overproduction and
boost prices that have dropped by more than 20 percent since
January.
   At issue is whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries should lower its official production ceiling or
alternatively cut its output, thus officially acknowledging
violations of individual member quotas.
   Another issue is whether quota violators should bear the burden
of any reduction or whether all 13 members should contribute
equally.
   Analysts say violations by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates have pushed OPEC output above the cartel's
self-imposed ceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day for the first
six months of the year.
   On arriving in Geneva, Iraqi Oil Minister Issam Al-Chalabi said
OPEC's daily output currently was between 23.7 million barrels and
24 million barrels.
   Overproduction has caused a glut during a time of seasonally
slackening demand in the second quarter. That has depressed prices
well below OPEC's minimum reference price of $18 a barrel.
   The average price of seven crudes monitored by OPEC stood at
$15.37 per 42-gallon barrel last week.
   North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, fetched a spot price of $16.45 a barrel late Tuesday in
London, unchanged from late Monday.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, settled at $18.81 a barrel Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The near-month contract traded at more than
$24 in late January.
   Boussena said: ``The single target is clear, how to eliminate
the surpluses existing in the market in order to allow a price
recovery. It is a single target and I'm certainly hopeful we can
achieve that target.''
   Asked how much output needed to be cut, he responded: ``It
certainly is something between one and one and a half million
barrels a day.'' When asked if such a cut would come from current
production, he replied affirmatively.
   Chalabi said he was willing to consider reducing the official
production ceiling through the end of June, and that all members
should contribute to an output cut.
   He added, ``We are not exceeding our quotas. We are good guys.''
   The United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Mana Saeed Otaiba
maintained that his country was observing its daily quota of 1.095
million barrels. Analysts believe the UAE is producing about twice
that.
   The ministers hadn't been expected to grapple with their
official quotas and minimum reference price until they held their
full, regular midyear conference on June 25.
   Indonesia's oil minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, said, ``OPEC
needs to solve its problem of overproduction quickly. Those
overproducing will have to cut.''
   One oil trader, who didn't want to be identified, said he wasn't
optimistic that decisive cuts would be achieved. The meeting could
give prices a psychological boost of 50 cents a barrel, but they
then should fall back a dollar a barrel, he said.
   Officially, the gathering is for OPEC's eight-member monitoring
committee, which only reviews markets and makes recommendations.
But all 13 members are expected to attend, which means a full
emergency conference can be called immediately.
   OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   The chairman of troubled defense group Ferranti
International PLC said Tuesday the company will write-off ``very
substantial'' assets during the year because of fraud at a U.S.
subsidiary.
   Recently appointed chairman Eugene Anderson said the charges
against earnings on the 1989-90 accounts would affect trading and
extraordinary items, but he did not specify an amount.
   Ferranti is expected to release full-year results in June.
   The British electronics and defense equipment maker is
struggling to recover from an alleged $353 million fraud involving
phantom contracts at its U.S. subsidiary International Signal and
Control Ltd., based in Lancaster, Pa.
   Discovery of the fraud led Ferranti to write off about $300
million and forced the company to arrange special, short-term
credit facilities with its bankers.
   In January, Ferranti agreed to sell its most-prized defense
business, its radar division, to its main rival, General Electric
Co. PLC for $508 million. GEC is not affiliated with the similarly
named U.S. company.
   At the company's general meeting, Anderson said the majority of
the write-offs will have ``no immediate cash-flow implications.''
   ``We will diligently pursue recovery of past losses arising from
the alleged ISC fraud through appropriate legal processes,'' he
said.
   Ferranti has filed suit against four former ISC executives
seeking $198.5 million the British company alleges were illegally
siphoned off. It has also filed suit in Britain's High Court
against its former auditors, KPMG Peat Marwick Mclintock, for
negligence.
   Anderson, who replaced Sir Derek Alun-Jones in February in an
attempt to turn the company around, said Ferranti's performance
over the past few years ``has not been satisfactory.''
   He told shareholders that a ``thorough strategic review'' was
under way.
   Anderson said the company's board was reviewing stock values,
reassessing profits or losses and making adequate provisions for
future liabilities, including reorganization costs.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed Tuesday in light trading
as many European markets were closed for the May Day holiday.
   Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for May delivery settled at $370 a troy ounce, up $1.60
from late Monday. Republic National Bank of New York also quoted a
late bid for gold at $370 an ounce, up $1.30.
   Bob Morrissey, a trader with Bank of Boston, said the dollar
traded in a narrow range, with little news affecting the market.
   The dollar gained after the release of the monthly index figure
from the National Association of Purchasing Management, which
indicated the U.S. industrial sector expanded slightly during April
for the first time in a year.
   News of an upturn in economic activity is good for the dollar
since it makes it more likely interest rates will rise. Higher
interest rates make the dollar more valuable relative to other
currencies.
   But the dollar was not able to sustain its gains and soon gave
them up, Morrissey said.
   Many European markets were closed for May Day, and trading in
the United States was thin, he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 158.90 Japanese yen from
159.08 yen on Friday. Japanese markets were closed Monday for a
holiday. Later Tuesday, in London, the dollar fell to 158.80 yen.
In New York, the dollar bought 158.85 yen, down from 158.90 late
Monday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6385 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6390 late Monday. In New
York, the dollar lost ground, with the pound trading at $1.6445,
more expensive than $1.6405 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday
quotes, included: 1.6805 West German marks, up from 1.6795; 1.4555
Swiss francs, up from 1.4530; 5.6370 French francs, up from 5.6330;
1,231.75 Italian lire, up from 1,230.50; and 1.1646 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1644.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
late rates included: 1.6785 West German marks, down from 1.6787;
1.4562 Swiss francs, up from 1.4512; 5.6450 French francs, up from
5.6335; 1.8927 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8884; 1,232.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,230.50, and 1.1645 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1649.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $368.50 a troy ounce,
up from $367.75 bid late Monday. Zurich gold markets were closed
for the holiday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.72 to close at a bid $370.83.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.013 per troy ounce, up from $4.932
late Monday. In London, silver bullion rose to a late bid price of
$4.97 a troy ounce, from $4.92 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor to Pay $14 Million for Overcharges</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Earns-Emerson Electric</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emerson Electric Co. pleaded guilty Tuesday to
making inflated cost estimates for electronic equipment it sold the
Pentagon and agreed to pay $14 million in fines and penalties.
   The company pleaded guilty in federal court to four felony
counts of filing false statements, U.S. Attorney Thomas Dittmeier
said.
   The company admitted that between 1983 and 1987 it gave false
and inflated cost estimates for equipment it sold the Defense
Department as a sole-source contractor.
   As a result of inflated estimates, the government was
overcharged for equipment it bought from Emerson, Dittmeier said.
   Emerson's plant, located in suburban Ferguson, was raided by
federal agents in February 1988. Emerson said it was told the
action was related to the alleged use of parts for U.S. military
vehicles on equipment that it was selling to Egypt.
   Emerson had contended following the raid that it transferred
equipment to vehicles it was assembling for Egypt under a ``borrow
and pay back'' agreement with the government. The claim, however,
was disputed by prosecutors.
   Dittmeier said Emerson's plea agreement called for the payment
of double damages for overcharges rather than the triple damages
that normally would have been assessed.
   Under an agreement, Emerson subsidiary Electronics &amp; Space Corp.
will pay $40,000 in fines in addition to the $14 million settlement.
   The false statements were on four military contracts for
automatic test equipment.
   Dittmeier said no Emerson officials were penalized individually
because of ``what appears to be a very institutionalized way of
doing business.''
   He said the settlement ``lets the public know that we did the
right thing and lets the defense industry know that we're looking
at them.''
   The guilty plea caps a grand jury investigation of fraud
allegations against Emerson, which makes electronic components for
several weapon systems.
   Emerson entered its plea before U.S. District Judge John F.
Nangle, who ordered the company to pay the $14 million within five
days to the Justice Department.
   The probe was conducted by the U.S. attorney's office in St.
Louis, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the Defense
Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Logistics Agency.
   The Justice Department also said it found evidence that Emerson
charged the government for parts it used on other contracts but
that this activity was not covered by the plea.
   Under the agreement, Emerson is required to submit accurate,
complete and current cost and pricing data and its best estimates
of future costs in order to enable the government to negotiate fair
and reasonable prices.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Shrug Off Purchasing Managers Report</HEAD>

   Prices advanced on Wall Street Tuesday as the
stock market shrugged off a purchasing managers report indicating
strength in the manufacturing sector.
   The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 12.16 to close at
2,668.92.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
820 up, 679 down and 467 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.02 million
shares, up from 122.75 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 176.15 million shares.
   The market opened higher but began to lose ground after the
National Association of Purchasing Management, which tracks the
manufacturing economy by surveying its members each month, said its
index rose to 50.2 percent in April from 48.8 percent in March.
   A reading above 50 generally indicates the economy is expanding.
   The purchasing managers report reawakened concerns in the
financial markets that a stronger economy would allow inflation to
accelerate, and that the Federal Reserve would in turn push
interest rates higher.
   Bond prices, which had been up in early trading, surrendered
their gains in response to the purchasing managers report, and the
stock market initially followed suit.
   But while the credit markets went on to close lower, Wall Street
took its own path, with blue chips first moving higher in the
afternoon and secondary stocks catching on later.
   Tuesday's session repeated what has become a familiar stock
market response to a negative report.
   Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said traders
realized that much of the bad news had already been discounted by
the market. Once the initial shock wore off and prices did not drop
further, buyers came back into the market, he said.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Security Pacific,
which closed unchanged at 36. Both Security Pacific and the
second-most active issue, Chase Manhattan, were involved in
dividend-related trading. Chase was off { at 24~.
   First-quarter earnings reports gave some stocks a boost.
Chrysler rose } to 15\ after issuing a somewhat
better-than-expected earnings report Tuesday, and Boeing was up 2{
to 72\ after announcing Monday that its sales jumped 60 percent and
its profits rose 87 percent.
   Pepsico fell { to 65} and Coca-Cola rose { to $76.75 after
Burger King announced it was switching to Coke from Pepsi in its
U.S. fast-food outlets.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $13.116 billion, or 0.41
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.73 to 182.22.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.64 to 387.08, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 1.45 to 332.25.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.78 to 421.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 343.32, up 0.22.

   The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved irradiation of poultry to control salmonella and other
bacteria that cause food-borne illnesses. But the industry said it
had no plans to use the procedure.
   The FDA said irradiation is safe and effective in eliminating
most bacteria in chicken, turkey and other fresh and frozen birds,
making poultry safe for longer periods under refrigeration.
   Poultry companies, however, said they do not plan to use the
technology because of consumer opposition and because ``the
consumer can achieve the same thing by cooking the chicken,'' said
Stephen Pretanik, science director at the National Broiler Council,
which represents the commercial broiler chicken industry.
   ``There does not appear to be wide consumer acceptance for any
food irradiation,'' he said.
   Although cooking chicken thoroughly kills illness-causing
bacteria, ``a lot of the sickness coming from chicken is coming
from cross-contamination'' when raw poultry comes in contact with
other food, said George Pauli, consumer safety officer at FDA.
   Irradiation of food was first approved in 1963, when the FDA
allowed its use to control insects in wheat and wheat flour. Later,
the FDA approved its use to control insects, spoilage and parasites
in other grains, fruits, vegetables, spices and pork.
   Irradiation of poultry is the first approved use aimed at
controlling bacteria in food that cause illness in humans.
   So far, the process has been used infrequently because of
consumer opposition, food industry officials said. When foods are
irradiated, they must be labeled that have been treated that way.
   The FDA on Tuesday emphasized that ``the process does not make
the food radioactive and, as a result, does not expose consumers to
radiation.''
   But Michael Colby, director of Food and Water Inc., a group that
researches food safety and environmental issues, said the FDA's
action was ``an outrage to consumers and to anyone who cares about
safe food products.''
   He said scientific evidence that irradiation is safe is lacking,
and that by approving irradiation, the FDA is allowing poultry
growers and processors to speed up their operations without having
to clean up their facilities.
   ``The problem with salmonella comes from the condition of
poultry facilities, and they're filthy,'' Colby said. ``The FDA is
proposing a toxic solution to a toxic problem.''
   Colby also said the states of New York, New Jersey and Maine
prohibit the sale of irradiated foods.
   In its approval, the FDA limited the amount of radiation that
can be used on poultry to 3 kiloGray. Doses of 1 to 10 kiloGray are
considered medium levels of radiation.
   Approval of irradiation for poultry was sought by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for inspecting meat
and poultry products, and Radiation Technology Inc. of Rockaway,
N.J., a firm providing radiation treatment.
   From 1973 to 1987, poultry accounted for 9.6 percent of the
food-borne illnesses in outbreaks for which a food source was
reported, the FDA said.
   Officials said there were no estimates on the incidence of
food-borne illnesses in the United States, but some estimate that
nearly everyone gets sick from food every couple of years. These
illnesses range in severity from a stomach ache to death.
   Radiation could be used to control such bacteria as Salmonella,
Yersinia and Campylobacter, which are common in poultry and can
cause gastrointestinal illnesses. Contamination can occur through
other foods or when the poultry is not cooked thoroughly.
   The FDA said it based its approval on studies in which
laboratory animals were fed diets containing irradiated poultry.
The study found the treatment to be effective and the treated foods
to be safe.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Fall After Strong Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell moderately Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade after a sudden reversal in a technically inspired
rally that had driven prices to new nine-month highs.
   Grain futures followed the soybean market and ended mostly lower.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures rose sharply; copper
futures surged; precious metals advanced; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 4{ cents to 6} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May down 5 cents at $6.27{ a bushel.
   Wheat futures settled 6} cents lower to 2{ cents higher with May
at $3.67{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 2{ cents higher with
May at $2.83} a bushel; oats were } cent lower to \ cent higher
with May at $1.64} a bushel.
   Soybeans for May delivery touched $6.55 a bushel, the highest
price for a near-month soybean contract since July 28, before the
rally ran out of steam.
   Analysts linked the early runup to chart patterns that indicated
to many traders that prices were likely to continue their recent
strong advance.
   The upswing in prices that began about two weeks ago was
underpinned by strong demand and relatively tight supplies, but
those factors had been known for long enough that analysts
discounted them as a reason for Tuesday's action.
   Prices peaked before noon, then fell amid heavy selling that
accelerated in the final hour of trading.
   ``The buying dried up, the selling picked up and the lower you
got, the more selling you ran into,'' said Jerry Zusel, manager of
Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s grain trading operations.
   The unusual volatility may have been a function of thin market
conditions due to the May Day holiday in Europe. With European
markets closed, there were fewer players in the soybean market and
prices fluctuated more freely.
   Oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange, largely on
speculation that OPEC ministers meeting Wednesday in Geneva will
agree on measures to firm up crude-oil prices.
   As cartel ministers arrived Tuesday for the emergency meeting,
OPEC president Sadek Boussena of Algeria said OPEC needs cut to oil
production by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day to help crude
prices recover from their recent slide.
   Crude oil values have fallen more than 20 percent since January.
   U.S. supplies of crude oil and refined products fell last week,
according to the weekly American Petroleum Institute stocks report
released after the close of trading.
   The trade group reported a relatively modest decline of 473,000
barrels of crude oil and steeper drops of 1.5 million barrels of
gasoline and 2.1 million barrels of petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 13 cents to 27 cents
higher with June at $18.81 a barrel; heating oil was 1.03 cents to
1.52 cents higher with June at 52.97 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .85 cent to 1.19 cents higher with June at 61.03 cents
a gallon.
   Copper futures rose sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange,
reflecting continuing concerns about tight supplies. Copper settled
2.9 cents to 5.2 cents higher with May at $1.221 a pound.
   Gold futures rose moderately, nearly erasing Monday's losses,
while silver and platinum futures posted strong gains.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $1.30 to $1.60
higher with May at $370 a troy ounce; silver was 8 cents to 8.4
cents higher with May at $5.013 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures ended $5.60 to $5.90 higher on the New York
Merc with July at $479.70 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Pork futures rose sharply, reflecting strong cash markets and
bullish technical signals in the pork bellies, which climbed the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound for the second straight
day.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .27 cent higher with June
at 73.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .42
cent higher with May at 82.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent to .78 cent higher with June at 63.85 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .40 cent to 2 cents higher with May at 68.65
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   President Bush told small business owners
Tuesday he will keep fighting to cut the capital gains tax and keep
government from trying to ``swallow a third'' of their businesses.
   ``Limited government must mean limited taxes,'' Bush told almost
200 members of National Small Business United and the National
Association of Women Business Owners.
   Bush, who wants the top tax rate on capital gains cut from 33 to
19.6 percent, said the government should not discourage people
``from investing in small businesses, nor should it swallow a third
of the business you've spent your life building.
   ``But that's what our taxation of capital gains does,'' Bush
said.
   The groups gave Bush a plaque and also introduced the president
to Elena Medvedkova, a leader of a newly affiliated Soviet
Association of Women Business Owners.
   The Sovet woman thanked Bush for the ``great opportunity'' to
visit the White House ``at this turning point'' in U.S.-Soviet
relations.

<HEAD>Southwest Becoming Hot Spot for Corporate Moves</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas and Houston were the top two
cities for corporate relocations in 1989, as cheaper costs made the
Southwest a hot spot to move companies, according to market
research by a top relocation firm.
   According to a study of 37,000 corporate moves handled by PHH
Homequity, Chicago slipped to fifth place from third and New York
to fourth from second last year. New York lost the most families to
other cities, the company said.
   ``One of the things is the cost of doing business there for
different types of industry. They'll find that moving to Dallas
will be better for them. It just makes sense,'' said Keith Bisogno,
a spokesman for PHH Homequity.
   He said the average appraised value of house home in New York
was $295,513, compared to $142,590 in Dallas, $117,057 in Houston
and $116,379 in Denver.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. moved 1,200 employees to Dallas from New
York in 1988, while Exxon Corp. announced last year it was moving
200 to 300 people to Dallas. Both cited costs as a factor.
   ``Basically it was a variety of reasons: the nearness of a major
international airport, the favorable business climate in Dallas ...
and the various amenities in terms of lifestyle, cost of housing
and such,'' Exxon spokesman Bill Smith said.
   ``We're saving about $60 million a year in administrative
costs,'' J.C. Penney spokesman Duncan Muir said. ``We owned the
building (in New York), but just occupancy costs and labor costs
(were high).''
   Mobil Oil Corp. also cited the high cost of living in New York
in its 1987 decision to move 1,200 people to Fairfax, Va.
   PHH Homequity, which bills itself as the nation's largest
corporate relocation firm, said it moved 1,294 families into Dallas
and 1,180 into Houston in 1989.
   Rounding out the top 10, Washington ranked third, Atlanta sixth,
followed by Denver, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
   New York lost 1,592 families last year to rank first on the list
of departures for the second year in a row. Dallas, Houston and
Denver were second, third and fourth, but Bisogno said a
significant number of those workers were transferred to other
Southwest cities.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday allowed
Torchmark Inc. to continue a proxy fight aimed at gaining control
of its bigger insurance rival, American General Corp.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Wiseman said a Tennessee state
commissioner overreached his authority when he ordered an end to
the proxy battle Monday. The state immediately appealed the ruling
to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.
   The judge said the order by Revenue Commissioner Joe Huddleston
interfered with the rights of stockholders to vote their shares at
Houston-based American General's annual meeting Wednesday.
   ``Regulating insurance companies is one thing, regulating how
people vote their stock is quite another,'' Wiseman said in the
ruling.
   Representatives of Torchmark, based in Birmingham, Ala., also
said an Indiana Superior Court judge, R.L. Milan, had delayed an
administrative hearing on the proxy battle in that state until next
Monday.
   Huddleston said Torchmark violated state law by soliciting a
majority of proxies designed to elect five new members of the
15-member American General board of directors.
   Torchmark attorney William Leech said Torchmark wants five
directors on the board who will listen to discussions about merging
the two companies. He said election of one-third of the directors
falls short of a takeover.
   Tennessee is one of 10 states in which American General is
considered domiciled because of operations there. Regulators in
Texas and New York, as well as Tennessee, have questioned the
legality of Torchmark's proxy solicitation. Missouri, California
and Virginia have approved the process.
   American General has assets of $32 billion. Torchmark, with
assets of $5 billion, has set aside $15 million for the proxy fight.
   Testimony during the hearing showed the proxy strategy was
adopted after American General directors rejected Torchmark's offer
of $50 in cash and $50 in Torchmark stock for each share of
American General stock.
   Huddleston was designated to hear the case for state Commerce
Commissioner Elaine McReynolds, who recused herself because she is
a former assistant vice president of American General Life &amp;
Accident Insurance Co., a subsidiary with 1,500 employees in
Nashville.
   Huddleston said state insurance law said no company or holding
company can seek to control a Tennessee company without prior
approval of the state Department of Commerce and Insurance.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador: Japanese Will Gain From Easing Trade Barriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to Japan asserted Tuesday
that Japanese consumers will be among the main beneficiaries of
easing barriers against American goods.
   Michael Armacost also said progress has been made toward
lowering Japanese trade restrictions, but the United States should
continue ``to firmly press our requests'' on trade issues.
   ``We've covered a fair amount of business in the past six or
seven weeks,'' Armacost told a news conference. ``It's been
satisfying to get some of these issues laid to rest.''
   Armacost, a career diplomat who was named ambassador a year ago,
was in Seattle to speak to a Japan-America Society meeting.
   He said a developing consumerism movement in Japan has resulted
in more unhappiness at trade practices that keep prices of imported
goods in Japan artificially high.
   ``There's a growing realization that these reforms are good for
them,'' he said.
   Lowering tariffs on wood products, for instance, raises the
possibility that Japanese could buy better housing, Armacost said.
``There are enough benefits to be shared,'' he said. ``This should
not be regarded as a one-way concession.''
   President Bush last Friday declined to cite Japan under a
section of U.S. trade law that provides for economic retaliation if
offensive trade barriers are not removed.
   Administration officials said targeting Japan could provoke a
public backlash against the United States and make it far more
difficult for Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to reform Japan's
trading system.
   Bush's decision was denounced by many members of Congress, who
said the United States' $49 billion trade imbalance with Japan is
bleeding American jobs and capital.
   The Bush administration last year cited Japan under the
so-called ``Super 301'' provision of the trade laws for barriers to
U.S.-made supercomputers, satellites and wood products.
   But in the past month, U.S. and Japanese negotiators have
reached agreements toward opening markets in all three of those
areas.
   The wood products agreement has been criticized by many
Northwest lawmakers and by small mill operators in the region as
not going far enough. But U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
said the agreement should boost U.S. wood products sales by $1
billion in 1991.
   Armacost said the agreements on computers, satellites and wood
products undoubtedly were hastened by a deadline for action set by
the Bush administration.
   But he said the accords are ``a gesture of good faith from the
Japanese government'' that they are willing to resolve trade
issues. ``It would be inappropriate to impose Super 301 now,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Germans demanded protection
against unemployment Tuesday, and labor leaders warned that Western
businesses are eager to exploit East Germany's low-paid work force.
   In the West German capital, Bonn, negotiators from both Germanys
met in an effort to complete by Friday a plan for merging the
economies and social institutions of the two nations.
   An estimated 600,000 workers held 700 rallies in both nations
during May Day gatherings Tuesday.
   In West Berlin, bands of mostly leftist radicals hurled
firebombs and rocks Tuesday night, and police responded with tear
gas and nightsticks. More than 50 people were arrested after
darkness fell in the tense Kreuzberg district of the city, West
Berlin police reported. There were no immediate reports of injuries.
   In the East German city of Leipzig, a group of leftist youths
brawled with a band of neo-Nazi youths in the market square, the
government news agency ADN reported.
   Three suffered minor injuries and 21 were arrested, the agency
said.
   Authorities have feared that the newly opened borders between
East and West Germany would result in clashes that wold spread into
East Berlin. As of late Tuesday, there were no reports of violence
in East Berlin.
   In an earlier West Berlin rally attended by 60,000 banner-waving
East and West Germans, speakers voiced the fears that unification
could bring high unemployment and an erosion of workers' rights.
   Ernst Breit, head of West Germany's Federation of Trade Unions,
said some West German businesses and politicians view East Germany
as a ``new low-wage land with possibly less social security, fewer
controls and weak unions.''
   One East German listener, 19-year-old Maria Hoensch, asked:
``What sort of future will I have? Nobody knows what will happen.''
   Economists have predicted that 500,000 to 2 million East Germans
could lose their jobs in the next two years as inefficient
state-owned enterprises are closed and others are forced to compete
with Western businesses.
   Government officials in both Germanys say the effects will be
temporary as Western businesses flood into the east, creating jobs
and raising living standards.
   The two Germanys expect to complete agreement this week on the
terms of an economic and social union that will go into effect on
July 2.
   Differences remain between the governments on how much financial
protection West Germany will give East Germans during the
unification process.
   Officials from both countries met again in Bonn to discuss the
issues and planned to hold more meetings Thursday and Friday in
East Berlin.
   Both sides say they hope to have a final plan finished by Friday
for absorbing East Germany's economy, public sector and social
welfare system.
   The negotiators want the plan ready before East Germans vote in
their first free local and state election Sunday. Voters had their
first democratic national elections on March 18.
   West Germans fear higher taxes, inflation and competition for
jobs may be the cost of bailing out East Germany's decimated
economy.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who faces re-election in
December, denied that taxes would be raised and dismissed fears
that inflation would result from replacing the nearly worthless
East German mark for the powerful West German currency.
   In an article to be published Wednesday in the West German
newspaper Die Welt, Kohl said the West German mark will remain
``the most stable and desirable currency in the world.''
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere wants some job,
housing and social subsidies retained at least temporarily to help
ease his nation's transition from four decades of heavily
subsidized socialism.
   West German officials have agreed to exchange most East German
marks at a 1-1 rate for West German marks when the western currency
is circulated in the country in July.
   The West German proposal calls for a 2-1 exchange for personal
savings of more than $2,300. But East Germany is demanding a higher
ceiling.

   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said Tuesday it was
considering selling some mills, box plants and timberland in the
wake of its pending $4 billion acquisition of Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp.
   The company's board of directors authorized management to
explore the sale of as many as 20 of its mills and plants following
its annual shareholders' meeting in Augusta.
   Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said timberland required to
support the plants also may be sold. He said the properties ``may
not fit our long-term strategy.''
   The plants targeted for possible sale were chose because of a
``geographic or product redundancy'' due to the planned acquisiton
of Norwalk, Conn.-based Great Northern, according to Sheila
Weidman, a company spokeswoman. She said Georgia-Pacific wasn't in
need of cash to complete the merger, which is expected to become
final by the end of June.
   The acquisition, approved in March, would make Georgia-Pacific
the nation's largest forest products company.
   Ms. Weidman declined to place a value on the assets that may be
sold, although the company announced last month it would sell at
least $1 billion in assets to cut costs, raise capital and reduce
debts.
   The company said it was considering selling a linerboard mill at
Valdosta, Ga.; a linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper
mill at Toledo, Ore.; a corrugating medium mill at Tomahawk, Wis.;
and box plants in East Point, Ga.; Garland, Texas; Milan, Mich.;
Modesto and Los Angeles, Calif.; Newark, Ohio; Newberry, S.C.;
Rutherfordton and Salisbury, N.C.; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; Olympia,
Wash.; Buffalo, N.Y.; Grafton, W.Va.; Miami; Bristol, Pa.; and Gas
City, Ind.

   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said a futures
trader agreed to a $50,000 fine and a six-month suspension of his
floor privileges to settle charges of a major trading offense.
   The exchange said in a statement Tuesday that Lloyd D. Gabbert
had directed the proceeds of certain trades of stock-index futures
into two separate accounts, improperly creating a loss in one
account and a profit in the other.
   The alleged offense occurred last Oct. 16, the exchange said.
   The Merc said Gabbert agreed to the penalty while neither
admitting nor denying the allegation.

   Michael Golden, a former general manager of
Child magazine, has been named publisher of McCall's magazine.
   The move announced Tuesday is part of a general reorganization
of the monthly magazine, which has undergone changes since it was
acquired last June by The New York Times Company Magazine Group.
   Golden, 40, will replace John Beni, the magazine's publisher
since 1988, who resigned.
   McCall's has a new design and editorial approach, and a new
editor-in-chief, Anne Mollegan Smith.
   Golden was credited with vastly improving Child magazine during
his two years there, according to a statement from the Times
company, which owns both Child and McCall's, along with 15 other
magazines.

<HEAD>Chrysler Officials Meet With City Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Chrysler Corp. representative met with
city and state officials to discuss plans to build a new sport
utility vehicle in Toledo and transfer production of the Jeep
Wrangler to Toledo from Brampton, Ontario.
   Michael Glusac, Chrysler's executive director of governmental
affairs, declined comment on details of Tuesday's meeting.
   ``I'm very optimistic that we can get a number of issues
resolved so we can build the JJ in Toledo,'' Glusac said, referring
to the vehicle Chrysler plans to build as part of a $500 million
joint venture with Renault of France.
   Mayor John McHugh echoed Glusac and said discussions with
Chrysler about financial incentives would continue.
   ``The talks were fruitful, but I really can't disclose any
details,'' he said.
   Chrysler said last week that it would build the JJ in Toledo and
move the Wrangler line there if it can resolve a number of issues
with the city and state and United Auto Workers Local 12.
   The company wants the city and state to provide tax abatements
and financing. It also wants to renegotiate a new contract with
Local 12 to replace a pact that expires in 1992.
   Workers will vote Friday on whether to reopen the contract, said
Ronald Conrad, Jeep unit chaiman for Local 12. He anticipated that
union members will approve the reopening.
   The city's two Jeep plants make Cherokees and Grand Wagoneers
and have a combined workforce of 5,300 people.
   Under the company's plans, Chrysler would begin producing the JJ
in July 1993, creating 700 new jobs.
   Chrysler also would shift production of the Wrangler to Toledo
from Brampton in July 1992. That move could create as many as 900
jobs in Toledo.

   Domestic coal production totaled 20.1

the 20.9 million tons produced in the previous week, the U.S.
Department of Energy reported.
   The U.S. coal industry produced 19.2 million tons in the same
week last year, the department's Energy Information Administration
said Tuesday.
   Kentucky ranked first among the 26 coal-producing states with
3.4 million tons produced. Wyoming was second at 3.3 million tons
and West Virginia third at 3 million tons, the agency said.
   Domestic coal production so far this year is 323 million tons, 6
percent ahead of last year's pace.
   The week's production accounts for bituminous and lignite coal.

<HEAD>French Complain US Farm Plan Hits Only Export Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. plan to cut world-wide subsidies to
farmers deals only with subsidies for exports and not with costly
domestic price supports, French Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet
complained.
   The 12 nations of the European Community want to negotiate on
all kinds of support to farmers, Nallet said Tuesday.
   Subsidies on farm products cost taxpayers and consumers tens of
billions of dollars a year not only in the United States and Europe
but in many other countries. Governments generally agree they
should be reduced, but the EC rejects the U.S. goal of eliminating
them completely.
   Nearly 100 governments taking part in the ``Uruguay round'' of
trade talks are trying to get agreements by the end of the year on
many kinds of trade. Subsidizing farmers is a key issue.
   ``I don't think that even in 10 or 20 years _ or even when we're
all dead _ that we'll be able to come to the point where there's no
assistance given to farmers whatsoever,'' Nallet told reporters
after a day of talks with U.S. leaders.
   He said U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter showed him an
interesting plan for what is called ``tariffication.'' Under it,
many kinds of subsidies and other barriers to trade would be
converted into a single barrier: customs duties on imported farm
products.
   Once governments agreed on such a conversion, it would be
simpler to reduce the barriers.
   ``We can agree on tariffication, as long as all subsidies are
included,'' Nallet said. ``The American plan would deal only with
export subsidies, not with domestic price supports.''
   He praised the work of the Organization for Economic and
Cooperation and Development, which groups the governments of the
major industrial countries, in calculating the value of their farm
subsidies. It showed New Zealand giving the lowest subsidies,
amounting to only about 10 percent of its products' value.
   Australia's subsidies are only a little greater, he said.
   Subsidies given by other major countries go from 27 percent by
the United States to about 70 percent for Japan. The rate for the
EC, which has a joint farm policy, was put at 38 percent.
   ``Every government gives subsidies,'' Nallet said. ``We're all
in the same boat.''
   He said he had found in Washington a new readiness to talk
realistically and to put all the elements on the negotiating table.
   ``Agreement is within our grasp,'' he added. ``I'm against
people who keep saying how difficult it all is.''

<HEAD>New Zealand's Only Private TV Network Seeks Receivership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Zealand's only private
television broadcaster asked bankers to appoint a receiver after
the station failed to attract viewers or advertising.
   In a brief statement to the New Zealand Stock Exchange
Wednesday, TV3 said Westpac Banking Corp., its principal banker,
``has withdrawn its banking facilities from the company.''
   ``Accordingly, the directors have resolved to request Westpac to
appoint a receiver,'' the statement said.
   TV3 is New Zealand's first private television network and is
14.7 percent owned by National Broadcasting Co. of the United
States, the highest level of foreign ownership allowed.
   It began broadcasting in October 1989 in competition to the two
state-owned networks and was floated on the stock exchange in
November. It beams to all major cities but not all rural areas.
   A total of 5.5 million shares, or 15 percent of TV3's capital,
were issued to the public at the equivalent of about $1.43 each.
The remaining shares were held by its founders. NBC's investment
totaled about $3.1 million.
   Stock is allowed to continue trading under stock exchange rules
despite Wednesday's announcement.
   Analysts said the company had difficulty attracting sufficient
advertising revenue in the small New Zealand market, a country of
just 3.5 million people.
   TV3 was still broadcasting its regular programs shortly after
Wednesday's announcement, and also was running promotional material
for programs scheduled to air on the weekend.

   Share prices rose sharply on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange Wednesday morning and the dollar declined against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average jumped 362.69 points, or 1.22
percent, ending the morning session at 30,052.52. The index rose
105.03 points the previous day.
   The dollar was changing hands at 158.48 yen at late morning. It
started trading at 158.62 yen, down 0.28 yen from Tuesday's finish,
and ranged between 158.40 yen and 158.70 yen during morning trading.
   The yen's strength encouraged investors and prompted buying of
stocks, dealers said.
   ``Share prices were higher almost across the board, as market
players expected the market's continuing uptrend after the
holidays,'' said Toshiyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa Securities
Co.
   Financial markets, including stocks and foreign exchange, are
open only Tuesday and Wednesday this week because of a series of
``Golden Week'' national holidays in Japan.
   In the currency markets, the dollar's slide in Tokyo followed
its downswing in New York the previous day, dealers said.
   They said market players were reluctant to increase their dollar
positions ahead of the holidays, especially with the U.S.
employment report due out Friday and the Group of Seven monetary
meeting over the weekend.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 85.81 from Tuesday's close of 85.65. That dropped the
yield to 7.41 percent from 7.445 percent.
