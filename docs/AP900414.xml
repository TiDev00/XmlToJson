   About 200 college students marched through
this northern New Jersey community Friday, hoping to defuse
tensions that flared following the fatal shooting of a black
teen-ager by a white policeman.
   ``We sympathize with the death of Phillip Pannell,'' said Walter
Fields, an official with the Bergen County chapter of the NAACP.
``We don't condone the violence but we do thoroughly understand the
anger.''
   Pannell, 16, of nearby River Edge was shot and killed Tuesday
night by Teaneck police officer Gary Spath, who was responding to
an anonymous telephone tip that a teen-ager had drawn a gun on
another youth.
   In another development, The New York Times reported in its
Saturday editions that Phillip's companions said he had been
handling a BB pistol before officers confronted them.
   The newspaper reported that several youths, interviewed
separately, said that Phillip was fooling around with the BB gun
when police approached the group.
   Pannell put the gun in his coat pocket and took off running just
before police intended to frisk him and the others, the youths told
the newspaper.
   It was then that the officer shot, killing Pannell, they said.
   Police have said they recovered a loaded .22 caliber gun from
Pannell. Another youth, however, told the Times that another
youngster carried the BB pistol away.
   Spath has since been suspended with pay and his partner, Wayne
Blanco, has been temporarily relieved of his duties, acting Bergen
County Prosecutor John Holl said.
   A grand jury is scheduled to begin hearing testimony on the case
on Tuesday.
   Franklin Wilks, an attorney representing Pannell's mother,
Thelma Pannell, held a news conference later Friday to release
details of an independent medical examiner's report.
   Wilks said the report corroborates eyewitnesses who said Pannell
had his arms up in the air at the time he was shot in the back.
Witnesses said Pannell was running away from police when he was
shot. Police said a loaded pistol was found on his body.
   Wilks said he had not seen a report by the Bergen County medical
examiner, which found the boy had been killed by a single shot in
the back.
   A peaceful candlelight vigil Wednesday night in remembrance of
the slain youth turned violent as mostly black teen-agers roamed
local streets smashing store windows and overturning cars.
   Much of the damage remained visible Friday. Plywood had replaced
what used to be windows in many businesses along Teaneck Road.
   The students who walked through Teaneck were members of the
Union of African Student Organizations, which represents 14
colleges in northern New Jersey. They included blacks, Hispanics
and whites.
   The students set out from the Teaneck campus of Fairleigh
Dickinson University, winding through the township and up Teaneck
Road to Tryon Park, close to where Phillip was killed. The event
did not disrupt traffic and the group had no police escorts.
   During the three-hour march, participants talked with residents
and merchants, Fields said.
   ``We tell them we're here because we're concerned,'' Fields
said. ``What's needed now is healing. We need to come together as a
community.''
   At Tryon Park, a human chain was formed around the perimeter of
a basketball court. Salaam Ismial, state coordinator of the Union
of African Students Organization, and Fields thanked the crowd for
its support.
   ``We have to some way, somehow, find a way to live with one
another,'' Ismial said. ``It's unfortunate that it took the death
of a young man to bring us all together.''
   Fields said he has asked teen-agers in Teaneck to stay indoors
during the weekend. He said he was convinced that tensions were
still high in the community, which has prided itself on being one
of the first to voluntarily desegregate it schools in the 1960s.
   ``We haven't really reached the emotional peak of this incident
yet,'' he said. ``It's going to be an emotional weekend.''

   A city work crew drenched by a passing
motorist got even by tracking the man down and getting police to
charge him with malicious splashing.
   City worker Tom Boudreau and his partner, who were monitoring
the flow of water through storm sewers, got drenched from head to
foot when a car sped by and sent a 5-foot-high gush of water over
them.
   Mad as wet hens, Boudreau said they got in their pickup truck
and tracked down Robert Petrin, 24, at a drive-in window of a bank.
   ``I wasn't going to let him get away with that,'' Boudreau said
Friday.
   Petrin denied deliberately splashing the workers in the March 14
incident, but police charged him under a malicious-splashing law on
the city's books since 1977.
   A District Court judge fined Petrin $55 on April 5 when he
failed to appear on the charge. There was no telephone listing for
Petrin and he could not be located for comment Friday.
   Public Safety Chief Wayne Heikkila said most motorists don't
have to worry because ``we're not going to stake out mud puddles.''

   Character actor Bob Lussier is turning his
back on Hollywood to become a Benedictine monk.
   Lussier, 55, the Volkswagen driver with the three sweaty
passengers in the Dial soap TV commercial and veteran of 26 films
over the last quarter-century, is trading his $365,000 Hollywood
hilltop home for a 10-foot-square room.
   He plans to spend the rest of his life at Pecos Benedictine
Monastery in Pecos, N.M. He said he decided his new role after a
visit to the Roman Catholic order in 1988.
   Lussier's movie credits include ``Johnny Got His Gun,'' ``The
Killing of Sister George,'' ``Mr. Mom'' and ``Pete and Tillie.''
He's also appeared in more than 200 TV commercials.
   But he was troubled by the Hollywood product and what he
considers its gratuitous portrayals of sex and violence, Lussier
said.
   ``I was being called upon to do some pretty tacky stuff,'' he
said. ``The care that people used to take with their productions
was missing. It all seemed to change the minute the non-artistic
corporations started buying film companies.''
   As Brother Lussier, he will say a prayer for Hollywood
decision-makers.
   ``I ask that they have a greater awareness of from where they've
received all of their gifts,'' he said. ``Hopefully they can use
those gifts in a way that will be respectable to God as they see
him.''

   As national television cameras rolled, hotel
queen and convicted tax evader Leona Helmsley wrote a check for $42
million to the Internal Revenue Service.
   Mrs. Helmsley said she agreed to be videotaped by the syndicated
Fox TV program ``A Current Affair'' to dispel any notion that she
doesn't pay her taxes. A witness in her federal tax-evasion trial
last year testified that Mrs. Helmsley said only the ``little
people'' pay taxes.
   Mrs. Helmsley said she and her husband, Harry, have already paid
$22 million in federal taxes for 1989 and another $30 million in
city and state taxes.
   She signed the check Friday at her Harley Sandcastle hotel in
Sarasota, Fla., where the couple are vacationing.
   As she realized she was signing a check on Friday the 13th, she
said, ``My lucky day, yup, my lucky day.''
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of evading more than $1.2 million in
federal taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses
through the Helmsley business. She was sentenced to four years in
prison, fined $7.1 million and ordered to pay $1.7 million in back
taxes and do 750 hours of community service. She remains free on
bail pending her appeal.

   Dana Carvey, the Church Lady in ``Saturday
Night Live,'' was wary about the title of his first starring movie,
``Opportunity Knocks.''
   ``I hate to give my critics ammunition with a title like that,''
he said. `` ... It could have been worse. It could have been called
`The Really Good Movie.' Then they could say, `The Really Good
Movie wasn't.'''
   The critics weren't as unkind as he feared. Several reviewers
said the comic has a real future in films, while others found the
script wanting. The film, about a small-time con man who hits it
big, has drawn modest returns in the nation's theaters.
   Carvey, 34, is the latest of the parade of ``Saturday Night
Live'' comics who have transferred to the big screen. The Church
Lady was his most notable creation: he also appeared as Hans of the
bodybuilding Hans and Franz, and mimicked George Bush, George
Michael and George Burns.

   Billionaire New York developer Donald Trump thinks
the only way to win the war against drug barons is to legalize
narcotics.
   ``We're losing badly the war on drugs,'' Trump told a Miami
Herald luncheon Friday. ``You have to legalize drugs to win that
war. You have to take the profit away from these drug czars.''
   Tax revenues from a legalized drug trade could be spent to
educate people about the dangers of drugs, Trump said in a speech
to about 700 people at the newspaper's Company of the Year Awards
luncheon.
   He blamed the country's current drug problems on politicians who
``don't have any guts.''

   Wolf Creek nuclear power plant officials
found a nickel in the water-cooled atomic reactor and are trying to
determine if someone treated the vessel as a wishing well.
   The coin was discovered Wednesday during routine refueling and
maintenace work about 25 feet down inside the reactor vessel.
   ``We're not sure how it got there in the first place, whether it
was accidental or done on purpose,'' Ronn Smith, a spokesman for
Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp., said Friday.
   Workers tried to retrieve the nickel by lowering down a piece of
lead with tape on it. They momentarily snagged it, but it broke
loose and fell deeper, Smith said.
   Smith said analysts believe the coin will not pose a hazard or
affect the operation of the reactor. The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has been informed, he said.
   The reactor vessel lies in a refueling pool of water used to
help shield workers from radioactivity and protect the fuel rods.
Its top section has been removed for the replacement of fuel rods.
   The coin had fallen through the 23-foot-deep water and about 25
feet inside the vessel. A crane-operated bridge spans the pool and
is placed directly over the reactor vessel when work is being done.
   Someone might have dropped the coin from the bridge or from
elsewhere in the reactor containment building, Smith said.

   Relax, worried parents. The National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, its face red over a memo that
fell off the vine, says it's safe for your kids to grow tomatoes
from outer space.
   Even eat them, if they must.
   ``I've never heard of a killer tomato, and I don't think we've
got a killer tomato plant here either,'' said Alvin Young, director
of the Agriculture Department's biotechnology office. ``That's
Hollywood script stuff.''
   The space agency suffered a public relations crisis Friday over
a memo raising the possibility that tomatoes grown from
space-radiated seeds might be poisoned. Some 120,000 packets of the
seeds were distributed to 58,000 teachers to be grown by their
students.
   ``The ... project is a safe and valuable educational outreach
program,'' said NASA. It said it was assured by the Agriculture
Department ``there were no food safety risks associated with the
tomato seeds and fruits they produced.''
   But the memo from Nelson J. Ehrlich obtained by the Los Angeles
Times said ``there is a remote possibility that a mutation could
occur causing the plants to produce toxic fruit.''
   Ehrlich is associate director for aerospace services at Oklahoma
State University, which oversees NASA's school programs, and his
memo was addressed to other supervisors of the project.
   Tomatoes, Ehrlich explained, belong to the nightshade family of
plants ``notorious for the production of toxic substances such as
scopolamine, atropine, belladonna, nicotine and solanine.''
Moreover, he said, foliage of the entire family is toxic.
   NASA reacted by calling a news conference to say all is well. It
produced a new letter from Ehrlich saying, ``I have no evidence to
support my statement other than the fact that the mechanism for
toxin generation is present in tomatoes.''
   And, said Ehrlich, he ``in no way intended to infer ... project
participants would risk their lives by eating tomato fruits.''
   Kenneth S. Pederson, an associate administrator of the space
agency, told reporters: ``I will be happy to eat the tomatoes. My
daughter is a schoolteacher ... her school is growing the tomatoes.
Our whole family is going to eat the tomatoes.''
   Young said raising the tomatoes is safe, but that he'd prefer
that schoolchildren replant the seeds to carry out the experiment
rather than eat them.
   The possibility of a child having an allergic reaction to
tomatoes grown from the seeds is very remote, he said.
   ``I realize we are going to put 12 million seeds out there
potentially, but I really doubt that the number is going to be big
enough for us to produce a toxic mutation,'' Young said. He added
there's no 100 percent assurance, however.
   ``There is no more danger from eating these tomatoes than from
eating those you find in a grocery store,'' said Jim Alston,
research director for Park Seed Co. of Greenwood, S.C., which
supplied the seeds in 1984. ``There is no radiation inherent in the
seeds.''
   Alston said radiation counters showed ``absolutely nothing''
when the seeds were returned to Earth in January.
   ``I am a parent. I have kids,'' he said. ``If my kid was
participating ... I would have no hesitation for them handling
them.''
   The seeds were in one of 57 experiment trays fastened to the
outside of a 12-sided frame that had been in orbit since 1984 when
it was retrieved in January by space shuttle Columbia.
   The satellite, named the Long Duration Exposure Facility, was
testing a number of different materials to determine how they
withstood the rigors of space.

   Two Swiss and a German were arrested for
trying to foment rioting between Moslems and Christian Copts, the
state-run news agency said.
   The Middle East News Agency, in a report Friday, but did not
identify the three by name or identify the German state in question.
   A source at the justice ministry later said one of the detainees
was West German. Officials at the Swiss and West German embassies
were not immediately available because of the Easter holiday.
   The agency said leaflets and books calling for sectarian strife
were found in the trio's apartment in Agoza, a fashionable Cairo
district popular with foreigners.
   Last month, Moslem fundamentalists stoned and set fire to two
Christian Copt churches and a youth club in southern el-Minya
province. Fifteen people were wounded and fire destroyed a
Christian-owned candy factory.
   The government said the riots were caused by a false rumor that
the son of the candy factory owner, a Copt, took obscene
photographs of a Moslem teen-age girl after drugging her.
   About 300 people, mostly Moslem extremists, were arrested in the
attacks, according to the Interior Ministry.
   Of the nation's 55 million people, between 5 million and 6
million are Christians.

<HEAD>Sulfa Drug Traces Found in Milk Samples</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration milk survey has
found traces of sulfa drugs in most of samples tested, but the
agency says all were far below levels that would threaten public
health.
   The FDA said Friday that three of the 70 samples tested also
were found to contain traces of sulfamethazine, which is not
approved for use in lactating cows because it may cause cancer at
some levels.
   ``The traces, while not of safety concern, nevertheless show
that a few dairy farmers or veterinarians have improperly used the
drug,'' the agency said.
   The study suggested milk from ``only a few animals'' that are
being treated improperly is reaching the market.
   Fifty-eight of the 70 samples contained some traces of the sulfa
drugs but at levels of only 1 part per billion to 3 ppb. The agency
considers 10 ppb the ``level of public health concern.''
   The three samples containing sulfamethazine also showed that
chemical present at concentrations of 1 ppb to 3 ppb, the agency
said.
   The FDA said it held the dairy industry and veterinarians
responsible for any illegal use of the specialized drugs.
   Friday's milk survey completes an FDA study started in February
after the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer
advocacy group, said it found milk samples in 14 metropolitan areas
contaminated with antibiotics and sulfamethazine.
   The agency said it planned to propose eliminating sulfamethazine
use in other animals used for food because the drug is a suspected
carcinogen.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the human resources
subcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, said the
FDA intentionally in February when it said the sample contained no
antibiotics. Weiss said the agency knew 58 were contaminated below
10 ppb.
   He said the subcommittee staff would investigate the agency's
actions.

   In the Israeli town of Kfar Chabad, a
Tudor-styled anomoly rises amid the Holy Land's jumble of ancient
and modern edifices.
   It is a replica of another building 6,000 miles away, at 770
Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn _ the headquarters of Menachem Mendel
Schneerson, the 88-year-old leader of the Lubavitcher Hasidim.
   It is also a symbol of the fealty of Schneerson's followers.
That loyalty, some political observers say, this week scuttled an
attempt by the Labor Party to form an Israeli government.
   Two members of the Knesset refused to back Labor, citing
Schneerson's opposition to trading land for peace, a cornerstone of
the Labor platform.
   Schneerson ``has again obstructed the formation of a government
in Israel,'' Allan Nadler, who teaches Jewish studies at McGill
University in Montreal, complained in a column in The New York
Times today.
   ``Once again, the parliament finds itself in the stranglehold of
an Orthodox rabbi for whom the welfare of the state of Israel is
entirely subordinate to parochial theological considerations,''
Nadler wrote.
   Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, a spokesman for Schneerson, denied that
Schneerson had issued any dictum to the rebellious legislators. The
rebbe, or grand rabbi, had not talked to either, he said, and had
taken no sides in Israel's political crisis.
   Schneerson did comment, obliquely, on the land-for-peace issue
in a speech several weeks ago. And one of the two legislators,
Rabbi Avraham Verdiger, called the rebbe's office to ask if
Schneerson had changed his position.
   Told he had not, Verdiger repudiated Labor ``on his own
initiative,'' Krinsky said. ``Lubavitch has not been involved in
any of the political horse-trading that's going on.''
   Schneerson's name has come up in previous Israeli controversies;
opponents claimed that he was behind efforts to amend the law so
the converts of non-Orthodox rabbis would not gain automatic
citizenship in Israel.
   In the United States, his followers have earned the enmity of
other Jewish groups by supporting moments of silent prayer in
public schools, and by pressing for the right to erect Hanukkah
menorahs in public places.
   The man at the center of these disputes is a small figure,
distinguished by his black fedora, white beard and penetrating blue
eyes.
   Born in Russia, an immigrant in 1941, he has never been to
Israel. In fact, apart from twice-yearly visits to his
father-in-law's grave in Queens, he has not left Brooklyn at all
since he took office in 1950.
   Schneerson is the seventh in the line of Lubavitcher rebbes
going back to his great-great-great-great-grandfather, Rabbi
Schneur Zalman, an acolyte of the founder of Hasidism, the Baal
Shem Tov.
   The Lubavitchers, like other Hasidim, are pious folk. The men
wear black and are bearded; the women cut their hair and wear wigs
after marriage.
   But unlike the others, the Lubavitchers are outward-looking,
eager to persuade other Jews to become more observant.
   Schneerson has presided over a rapid expansion of the
Lubavitcher universe. More than 1,000 ``Chabad'' houses have been
established around the world to spread the word; the rebbe's
speeches, sometimes extending six hours, are sent by satellite to
cable systems around the world; recreational vans, known as
``Jewish tanks,'' roam the country to promote Jewish ritual.
   Lubavitcher officials claim a million followers around the
world; others dispute that figure but agree that the movement is
influential.
   ``Lubavitch is the single most powerful movement in the Jewish
world,'' said Rabbi Irving Greenburg, an Orthodox rabbi and critic
of the Lubavitchers who heads the Center for Learning and
Leadership.
   Schneerson is the movement's soul. More than 125 volumes of his
talks, writings and correspondence have been published. His
pictures hang everywhere in Israel. His advice is sought on all
matters _ whether a couple should marry; the solution to a business
question; even, says Krinsky, the answer to complex mathematical
problems.
   His followers recall seemingly miraculous consequences of
Schneerson's suggestions _ lives that were saved, babies that were
born, marriages that were made.
   These stories have led some to ask whether the rebbe is actually
the messiah, come to Earth to redeem the Jews.
   Such talk outrages other Jewish leaders. Schneerson has never
claimed to be the messiah; Krinsky says only that if the messiah
should come, the rebbe _ said to be a descendent of King David's _
would be qualified.
   Krinsky says there can be no dispute about one thing: ``There's
no greater spiritual leader in the world Jewish community.''

<HEAD>Arson Ruled Out in Hotel Fire That Killed Nine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire investigators have been able to
pinpoint where a hotel fire that killed nine elderly people
started, but not how.
   They have ruled out arson, however, in the April 6 fire at the
residential Fontana Hotel.
   ``We have sifted and gone through practically every foot of dirt
and debris that was in the building. It was not a set fire,''
Malcolm Brady, chief of the Miami office of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Friday.
   Nearly 100 residents were left homeless by the deadliest fire
ever in the oceanside city.
   Investigators are certain the fire started in a crawl space
below the third floor of the 102-room hotel where residents had
reported a water leak and plumbers had been working less than 24
hours earlier, Brady said.
   However, after more than 250 interviews, expert analysis of burn
patterns and a search by an accelerant-sniffing dog, state and
federal fire investigators failed to pinpoint the cause of the
blaze.
   ``It's tremendously frustrating for all of us to arrive on a
scene that's taken nine lives and not to be able to come to you
conclusively and say this is what caused it,'' Brady said.
   The blaze was so intense that temperatures reached more than
1,200 degrees, steel melted and and crucial evidence was destroyed,
Brady said.
   ``It probably smoldered in that crawl space for a number of
hours, literally consuming itself until it ignited,'' Brady said.
``Some of the evidence we needed is gone forever.''
   Authorities have identified all nine bodies recovered from the
three-story hotel located between the city's trendy art deco
district and a strip of luxury high-rise condominiums.
   Investigators don't expect the death toll to rise. Five other
occupants reported as missing after the fire have since been
located.
   All nine victims, ranging in age from 75 to 93, died of smoke
inhalation, said Dr. Katherine Berg of Dade County medical
examiner's office.
   More than 60 searchers, including arson experts from the ATF and
city and state fire marshal's offices, took part in the
investigation, and workers continued to comb through the blackened
shell of the building Friday.

commodities has been suspended until USDA completes an
investigation of possible financial irregularities.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder, who oversees international
affairs and commodity programs, said in a brief statement Friday
that the department ``is continuing its administrative review,
begun several months ago, into transactions relating to past
(credit) programs with Iraq.''
   Crowder said Iraqi authorities are cooperating in the
investigation and that a U.S. team will be in Baghdad soon to
continue the discussions.
   Meanwhile, he said, additional commitments of export credits
``will await the conclusion of this administrative review.''
   The action involves the Export Credit Guarantee Program, which
provides short-term credit guarantees for up to three years. The
government does not lend any money but acts as a back-up for
exporters and commercial banks.
   Kelly Shipp, press secretary for Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, said the departmental team plans to be in Iraq next week.
She said the irregularities appear to involve pricing and shipping
procedures. She did not offer specifics.
   For the current fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, Iraq was
allocated a credit line of $1 billion, she said. Only $500 million
has been used, and the rest is being held up until the
investigation is completed.
   Shipp said the investigation began last October and has nothing
to do with another snarl of financial problems involving Iraq's
credit operation with Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, or BNL, in Rome.
   In that case, BNL's branch in Atlanta, Ga., allegedly ran up a
$3 billion credit exposure with Iraq, Italy's Treasury Minister
Guido Carli said last September. The Agriculture Department's
export credit program was said to have guaranteed part of that
amount.
   The Justice Department and others reportedly are investigating
the BNL case.

<HEAD>White House Hopes New Visa Policy Will End Boycott Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The White House is hoping a new 10-day visa
that won't require foreigners to reveal their AIDS status will end
threats of a boycott of an upcoming international conference on the
disease in San Francisco.
   But it was unclear whether the action will be enough to satisfy
critics of U.S. immigration restrictions.
   ``I don't know whether they'll view this as sufficient,'' said
June Osborn, chairwoman of the National Commission on AIDS. ``But
it's something we can point to and say `Look, we're trying,' and in
that I think it will be a reassuring signal to the rest of the
world.''
   Members of Congress also said they were encouraged by the
administration's action creating the new visa, announced Friday by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But they also said the
move was only a first step.
   ``More needs to be done,'' said Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga.,
sponsor of legislation that would clear the way for the
administration to take AIDS off a list of diseases used to bar
entry to the United States.
   Dozens of organizations worldwide have said they will boycott
the San Francisco AIDS conference in June in protest of U.S.
immigration policy that restricts entry of people infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   The World Health Organization, an arm of the United Nations, is
considering whether to withdraw its co-sponsorship of the
conference. Michael Merson, acting head of WHO's global program on
AIDS, said from Geneva on Friday night that he could not comment
until he and other officials reviewed the administration's action.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said that while the new visa was
``a first step,'' he was troubled that it would be available only
for those attending certain conferences deemed by the secretary of
Health and Human Services to be ``in the public interest.''
   ``Will the administration be limiting visas to censor meetings
they don't approve of?'' he asked.
   Waxman, a co-sponsor of Rowland's bill and chairman of a House
health subcommittee, said his panel will hold hearings on the
legislation later this month.
   Administration sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said the White House has no plans to support the bill, and
supporters have said it has little chance to pass without such
backing.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said it was premature for the
administration to take a position on the bill.
   ``Rather than wait for what tends to be the molasses-like speed
of Congress to debate and vote on a piece of legislation, we are
taking actions that are immediate and effective,'' she said.
   The administration has said there is little it can do to ease
immigration restrictions on people with AIDS because of an
amendment, offered by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and passed by
Congress in 1987. The legislation put AIDS on the list of
contagious diseases that can be used to exclude foreigners.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who has
authority to determine which conferences are in the public
interest, immediately certified two events under the new visa
policy: the Sixth International Conference on AIDS to be held June
20-24 in San Francisco; and the 19th International Congress of the
World Federation of Hemophilia to be held Aug. 14-19 in Washington,
D.C.
   ``It is important that we support the free exchange of
scientific information across international boundaries,'' Sullivan
said. ``In particular, when we confront a worldwide public health
threat like AIDS, researchers need to be able to share their
findings quickly.''
   The current waiver policy INS adopted last year will remain in
effect, the agency said. That allows people infected with HIV to
visit the United States for up to 30 days to attend educational or
medical conferences, to receive medical treatment, to visit close
family members or to conduct temporary business activities, as long
as the person is otherwise admissible.
   INS had been expediting that process for people who want to
attend the San Francisco and Washington conferences.

<HEAD>Drug Chief Says DC Situation Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The drug situation in the nation's capital is
improving, but city officials are not using all the available
federal money, says national drug chief William J. Bennett.
   ``The situation remains far from acceptable, to be sure. But at
the same time, some things are moving in the right direction,'' the
national drug control policy director said at a news conference
said Friday.
   ``I think it's fair to say the record is mixed, spotty,
incomplete _ not nearly as good as anyone would like, but also not
so bad as many people might imagine,'' Bennett said in assessing
progress of a year-old federal-local anti-drug effort in the
District of Columbia.
   Bennett said the city's record murder rate in 1989 was ``a
bitter disappointment to all concerned,'' but that the overall
situation was not as negative as some had expected.
   ``I'm not here to declare failure,'' Bennett said. ``By a sober
assessment of the merits, I don't think that's warranted.''
   In 1989, 438 persons were killed in the nation's capital, and
police blamed a flourishing drug trade for more than 60 percent of
the slayings.
   Bennett said signs of progress include decreases in the number
of people arrested who test positive for drugs and of hospital
emergency room patients who mention drug use.
   But the drug policy coordinator said more progress might have
been made if the city had taken better advantage of available
federal money.
   Bennett said, for example, that the city failed to spend 85
percent of $2.3 million in funding for special National Guard
anti-crime assistance.
   In all, federal funding to city anti-drug efforts has increased
by 40 percent since last September and now is at a level
two-and-one-half times the national average, Bennett said.
   ``We chose D.C. for this effort because D.C. was on fire,''
Bennett said. ``Washington remains a federal priority in the war on
drugs.''
   But Bennett said federal officials will expect improvement from
the city in several areas, including moving forward on prison
construction and drug treatment centers.
   D.C. Mayor Marion Barry is awaiting trial on cocaine possession
and perjury charges stemming from his January arrest.

   A woman cancer patient who rejected
chemical and radiation treatment so she could give birth to a
healthy baby has died.
   Linda Babcock, 41, gave birth to a 5-pound 6-ounce boy Feb. 23
while battling an inoperable lung cancer known as oat cell
carcinoma. She had rejected treatment for fear of damaging the baby
and refused to have an abortion.
   The baby, Jesse, is doing fine.
   ``He's a beautiful son. I'll find a way to take care of him,''
Mrs. Babcock's husband, George, said Friday night.
   ``The baby kept her going,'' he said.
   Shortly after she gave birth, Mrs. Babcock said in an interview
from her room at St. Joseph Medical Center in Bloomington that she
didn't believe she had cancer anymore.
   ``I feel so much better. I can breathe. I could tell it was
there before. It felt like something cutting off my air, taking my
life,'' she had said.
   ``I'm confident of living, of beating the cancer ... The baby
saved me from death as I saved him.''
   Her doctors had been skeptical that she'd be able to deliver a
healthy baby without treatment. After she did, they said her cancer
still was very malignant and that if it went untreated, her chances
for survival appeared slim.
   ``After the birth, she went downhill real fast,'' her husband
said.
   She was hospitalized for almost a week before she returned
Thursday to her home here in rural east-central Illinois, Babcock
said. He said she refused radiology and chemotherapy treatment to
the end.
   She had survived pregnancy by adopting a nutritional diet of
organically grown vegetables and fruits, carrot juice and vitamin
pills.
   Mrs. Babcock had three other children.

<HEAD>Insect Incinerator Recall Reissued</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One importer of a major brand of electric bug
killers has reissued a recall for four of its models, a government
agency says..
   The back yard devices are being recalled because they present a
potential fire hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said
Friday. Few consumers have returned them as originally requested
last summer, the commission said.
   Dead insects accumulating in the devices and high humidity can
cause them to catch fire.
   The company knows of 20 such fires that caused property damage.
   The recall involves Charmglow bug killer models 071512, 073425,
074001 and 078012.
   The CPSC said just 195 of the 8,000 bug killers that were sold
nationwide in 1987 have been returned.
   Buyers should contact the importer _ Allied Tube and Conduit
Corp. of Harvey, Ill. _ at 1-800-558-5502 for directions on how to
return the bug killers for a full refund.

   Residents of the north-central United States
and central Canada may see a rainbow of colors in the night sky
before dawn on Easter Sunday if a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration experiment proceeds as planned.
   NASA announced that the Pegsat satellite would release a
canister of barium at 1:36 a.m. EDT Sunday 362 miles above the
earth over northern Canada, between Churchill and Yellowknife, if
conditions are right for the test.
   The barium should form a yellowish cloud, which will change to
green and white, then fade while a purple streak grows vertically,
NASA said.
   The experiment is aimed at studying the interactions of the
barium with the electric and magnetic fields of the earth and with
other characteristics of space at that altitude, NASA said.
   Scientists at several sites in the United States and Canada will
be watching the barium cloud.
   The Pegsat satellite was released from the unique winged Pegasus
space vehicle launched from a B-52 on April 5.

<HEAD>Poles Sadly Accept Soviet Apology for Massacre of 15,000 Polish
Officers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poles tearfully accepted the Soviet
Union's apology for the massacre of almost 15,000 Polish officers
during World War II, but demanded reparations and more details of
the killings.
   ``It's good that criminals admit their crimes,'' Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa said in Gdansk Friday. He called the Soviet
admission ``an act of moral justice, which has been awaited for a
long time.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gave President Wojciech
Jaruzelski documents showing that the secret police of Soviet
leader Josef Stalin killed the Polish officers on Soviet territory
during World War II.
   Jaruzelski, on an official visit to Moscow, was to visit Katyn
today. The area is in the Smolensk forest in Western Russia, where
at least 4,000 of the officers are buried in mass graves.
   The Soviet admission ended nearly 50 years of official Soviet
denials and had been almost a prerequisite for improved
Polish-Soviet relations. The Soviet Union had previously insisted
that Nazi Germany was responsible for the massacre.
   ``I awfully regret that my mother could not live until this
day,'' said Wanda Zadrozna, crying as she recalled her father's
murder in the Russian woods.
   Ms. Zadrozna said her father, Piotr, was taken prisoner by the
Russians in 1939, when she was 12 years old. She said her family
received three letters from her father over the next year, but
never heard from him after 1940.
   She said her mother, Helena Krahelska, kept a pair of shoes and
a clean shirt ready for him for nine years, despite growing
evidence that he had been killed.
   In 1943, Nazis invading the Soviet Union unearthed mass graves
in Katyn filled with the bodies of the Polish officers. They had
been shot in the back of the head and their bodies stacked one on
top of the other.
   ``This news was so horrible, no one wanted to believe it. We
treated it as propaganda,'' Mrs. Zadrozna said.
   But in 1948, Mrs. Krahelska gave up hope that her husband would
return home. She died eight years ago, never having been able to
visit her husband's gravesite in the Soviet Union.
   ``Whatever happens now, it is good that the truth will be
finally written in history,'' Ms. Zadrozna said.
   Bozena Lojek, who helps lead an organization of victims'
relatives called the Katyn Family, said she felt ``great joy now
that after so many years the truth has been revealed.'' Her late
husband's father was one of the officers who was killed.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said Poland
recognizes the significance of the official Soviet statement, but
wanted more questions answerd.
   ``We await an explanation of all the `blank spots' in our common
history, which the Katyn crime symbolizes for us,'' she said.
   The bodies of more than 4,200 officers, interned by the Soviets
at Kozielsk, were uncovered in the forest. But the remains of
another 10,000 officers who were captive at camps in Starobielsk
and Ostashkow have never been found, and their families still
demand to know of their exact fate.
   Walesa said there must be ``punishment of those guilty of the
genocide,'' reparations for the officers' families and access for
Poles to the victims' graves.
   In Friday's government statement, issued as Gorbachev met with
Jaruzelski, the Soviet Union clearly tied together the fates of the
officers.
   ``Recently, documents have been discovered which indirectly but
convincingly testify that thousands of Polish officers who died in
the Smolensk woods half a century ago became victims of (Stalin's
secret police chief Lavrenti) Beria and his henchmen,'' Tass quoted
Gorbachev as saying at the meeting.
   The officers were regarded as the cream of Poland's pre-war
society and many observers have said the Soviets may have
consdidered them a threat to the future Communist leaders of Poland.

<HEAD>Town Gets Economic Boost From Crinkly, Colorful Easter Grass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOUNT UNION, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This quiet industrial town once had all
its economic eggs in one basket _ brick-making. Now, part of its
future is pinned to baskets of eggs.
   Not just any eggs. Easter eggs. More specifically, the colorful
plastic grass that goes underneath them.
   Mount Union, in central Pennsylvania, is home to one of the
nation's leading producers of Easter basket grass. The plant where
the crinkly grass is made helped revitalize the town's economy when
it opened in 1979, a time when brickyard kilns were cooling from a
downturn in building.
   The 105 employees of the Bleyer Industries Inc. factory have a
busy season from November to a couple of weeks before Easter. But
the plant runs all year round, branching into tinted plastic wrap
at other times of the year with a reduced staff.
   ``We made 18 million bags of grass this season,'' said manager
Frank Lukens. ``We've been making about a million more bags each
year.''
   Liquid polypropylene arrives at the plant by rail and is
converted to sheets of tinted plastic, then stretched and run
through 10 machines with slits spaced one-eighth inch apart, Lukens
said. The grass kinks when the tension is relaxed, then handfuls
are stuffed into 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-ounce bags adorned with bunnies,
or the grass is rolled into 80-pound bales.
   The grass comes in pink, yellow and green.
   During the Easter rush, the plant runs 10 hours a day, six days
a week. Some large chocolate and gift makers, such as Russell
Stover Candies in Kansas City, Mo., make their own grass to
accompany their Easter products.
   More than 6,000 people lived in Mount Union in the middle of the
century, turning clay from nearby mountains into bricks. But the
population steadily fell to the present level of 3,000 as three
large brick factories closed over the last 20 years, the last in
January.
   The town went scrambling for replacement businesses, and borough
manager Frank Stasenko said it has succeeded in diversifying its
economy. In addition to the Easter grass factory, Mount Union is
home to a plant that makes fiberglass tanks for gasoline stations
and another that makes pipe fittings.
   ``We've been as low as we're going to get,'' Stasenko said.
   Lukens doesn't like to talk about the plant, and no tours are
allowed. He won't say why the company prefers to keep a low profile.
   One reason for the silence could be to discourage competitors
from entering the Easter grass market, Stasenko suggested. Another,
he said, might be concern from environmentalists over what to do
with the plastic grass when Easter is over.
   For that, Lukens has a solution.
   ``Save it. My mother still has the Easter grass from the basket
I got when I was four years old,'' he said.

<HEAD>King Expresses Grief at Loss of Life</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Birendra, in his first reference to
the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters, today expressed
grief at the loss of life, but he said politics in Nepal had
``taken a new turn.''
   In a nationwide broadcast, however, the king made no reference
to meeting Friday with the principal opposition leader. During the
talks, the king reportedly agreed to the formation of a new
government led by the opposition.
   ``The loss of life and destruction of property have saddened us.
We pray for the eternal peace of those who lost their lives in
tragic circumstances,'' Birendra said in a television and radio
broadcast on Nepal's new year's day.
   The government has said at least 10 people died and 107 were
injured on April 6, when security forces fired on 200,000 people
protesting for a multiparty system. Witnesses said at least 200
people were killed.
   Two days later, Birendra submitted to demands from the
opposition alliance that led the 7-week-old pro-democracy movement
and lifted a 29-year-old ban on political parties in his Himalayan
kingdom.
   ``We have upheld the tradition of respecting the popular will
and fulfilling the aspirations of the people,'' Birendra said.
``Politics in Nepal has now taken a new turn.''
   But in his brief speech Birenda did not mention his talks with
Ganesh Man Singh of the Nepali Congress Party. The hourlong meeting
was the first between Birendra and Singh since the pro-democracy
movement burgeoned in February.
   In a statement the opposition said Friday the king had agreed to
allow the alliance to head a government until general elections are
called. It did not say when balloting would be held.
   Singh said the king agreed to discuss on Sunday eight other
conditions set by the alliance for participating in any interim
government. Those include dissolution of the ational assembly and
constitutional reforms.
   Birenda said a proposed commission on constitutional reform
``will consult elements of society professing different political
views in the course of preparing its report.''
   The constitution gives the king absolute judicial, executive and
legislative powers. The current government is largely a
rubber-stamp body controlled by the king, and the national assembly
is a partyless single-chamber body dominated by the king's nominees.
   ``We are confident that proper understanding and respect for the
norms of democracy by all Nepalese will safeguard the values and
ideals of democracy in Nepal for all time to come,'' Birendra said.
   ``May Nepal and all Nepalese live in security and be able to
maintain their self-respect,'' said the 44-year-old Harvard
educated monarch.
   The Nepali Congress Party president, K.P. Bhattarai, said
Birenda's speech was ``not complete. We expected announcement
agreeing to all the eight points and at least a mention of those in
the speech.''
   ``We are not much disappointed because the liberal trend is
there,'' Bhattarai said.
   The Nepali Congress Party formed Nepal's only Western-style
parliamentary government in May 1959, but was dismissed 20 months
later by Birendra's father, King Mahendra, on grounds of corruption
and maladministration.
   Except for that brief period, Nepal has been ruled by the royal
Shah dynasty or the hereditary Rana prime ministers since the
mid-18th century.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are examining allegations
that a Florida company provided faulty parts for the space shuttle
and several weapons systems, a report published today said.
   Impala Electronics Inc. of Tampa, Fla., is being investigated on
charges it switched labels on resistors used to regulate currents
in electronic control systems, The New York Times reported.
   A Pentagon memo dated Oct. 16 said the relabeling scheme
involved buying inferior quality resistors and then changing their
markings or codings, the Times said.
   The government recently tested 10 resistors supplied by Impala
and nine failed, the Times said.
   But the newspaper said there is no evidence that the resistors
have caused safety problems on the space shuttle, including that of
the Challenger, which exploded after takeoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing
all seven crew members.
   The Tampa office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the
Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Service and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administrations's inspector general
are conducting the investigation, the Times said. It said Impala
and its president, Joseph A. Pistone, are targets.
   A lawyer who represents Impala would not comment and Pistone did
not return several telephone calls left with his secretary, the
Times said.
   The Times said Impala doesn't deal directly with the government.
Instead, Impala distributes resistors made by other companies to
the Pentagon or space agency contractors or subcontractors.
   According to the memorandum, these companies include the
McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Boeing, Raytheon, the Martin
Marietta Corporation and Honeywell Inc., the Times said.

   A tornado tore through six villages in

   Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, is often
buffeted by natural disasters. Summer floods, cyclones and storms
kill hundreds of people every year.
   At least 166 people were killed and 1,600 injured in storms that
battered parts of the country late last month and in early April.

   Pope John Paul II led a torchlight procession
through the Colosseum in one of many Good Friday ceremonies
worldwide marking Jesus' death on the cross.
   The pope was to celebrate the Easter Vigil tonight and an
open-air Mass on Easter Sunday in St. Peter's Square.
   Thousands holding candles in red paper cones watched Friday
night as the pontiff carried a 5-foot-high cross from the Colosseum
to the edge of the ancient Roman Forum, evoking the tortures Jesus
suffered as he walked to his crucifixion on Calvary Hill in
Jerusalem.
   The event was broadcast to millions throughout the world and
seen in the Soviet Union for the first time.
   Another procession, the 146th annual re-enactment at an ancient
Indian ceremonial site in Mexico, was attended by hundreds of
thousands. Thousands of pilgrims also retraced the traditional
route of Jesus' death in Jerusalem's Old City,
   In the Philippines, more than 20 Filipino penitents were nailed
to crosses for up to 10 minutes and others whipped themselves
bloody. The Philippines is Asia's only predominantly Christian
nation.
   ``All of us who belong to the priestly people of the new
covenant gaze upon the cross, with veneration and recollection,''
John Paul said in a brief Italian-language speech following the
procession of the Via Crucis, or Way of the Cross. ``We draw
nourishment from the impenetrable mystery, which human words cannot
describe.''
   The pope, wearing white robes and a crimson cape trimmed with
gold, carried before him a slender black cross made of lightweight
wood. He was followed by two men bearing torches and a group of
cardinals and other priests.
   At each of the 14 stops representing the stages of Jesus'
suffering, men and women read meditations written by the Latin
Patriarch of Jerusalem, Michel Sabbah. They asked for spiritual
blessings for modern Christians.
   Thousands of nuns, tourists and Romans outside the Colosseum
prayed and sang in Latin as the pope walked slowly between the
stations. A large cross made of candles flickered inside the
Colosseum.
   The Good Friday ceremonies mark the most solemn day of the year
for Christians, who celebrate Jesus' resurrection on Easter Sunday.
   Pope Paul VI revived the papal tradition of re-enacting the Way
of the Cross in 1964 after an interruption of nearly a century
following the creation of the modern Italian state.
   Earlier, in a Good Friday message issued to Maronite Catholic
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, the pope appealed anew for a halt to the
``fratricidal'' fighting in Lebanon.
   ``The drama of Lebanon must end ... Lebanon must live again,''
said the telegram, sent on the 15th anniversary of the start of
Lebanon's civil war.
   The pontiff also celebrated a ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica
Friday afternoon marking Jesus' death. Just after noon, John Paul
heard the confessions of 12 pilgrims in St. Peter's Basilica,
continuing a Good Friday tradition he began 11 years ago to
emphasize the importance of the sacrament penance.

   Andy Valence will stand proud Easter Sunday
as the jetty he fought so hard for protects his friends and
neighbors on Grand Isle.
   Valence is mayor of the tiny island community of 2,000, and the
rock jetty that keeps the Gulf of Mexico at a distance is a rare
victory over natural and man-made forces eating away at Louisiana's
coastline.
   At sunrise on Easter, services are planned for a spot that last
summer was knee-deep in the waters of the Gulf, waters that later
threatened an island motel.
   Valence was considered misguided, at best, when he proposed
building a rock jetty to keep the Gulf from destroying the island.
The experts shot him down, but he persevered and after years of
work recently completed much of the structure.
   Now, Valence said, ``the rocks are doing exactly what they are
supposed to be doing.''
   Louisiana loses 30 to 50 square miles of coastline every year,
an acre every 15 minutes, or an area the size of Rhode Island every
30 years.
   Nowhere along the coast was the loss more apparent than about 50
miles south of New Orleans at Grand Isle, the state's only
inhabited barrier island, a strip of sand that served as
headquarters for Jean Lafitte when the buccaneer was the scourge of
English and Spanish shipping almost 200 years ago.
   Grand Isle, along with the rest of Louisiana's coast, once was
replenished annually by sediment washing down the Mississippi
River, but man built locks and dams for commerce, and lined the
lower river with levees to protect communities on its banks.
   Nature continues to send hurricanes against the island, but the
changes prevent silt from replenishing the sand that washes away.
   Experts said hard structures such as jetties and seawalls were
self-defeating, that the waves would find the weak spots and wash
away the sand there. They pointed to failures in Galveston, Texas,
around the Florida peninsula and up the coast to Fire Island, N.Y.
   Valence spent seven years in solitary study of winds and tides,
weather patterns and the different rates of scouring action on
seashells. He taught himself enough physics to answer the questions
he asked himself and enough math and geometry to implement the
answers.
   ``While most people were sleeping or watching Johnny Carson, I
was out there walking a levee which has been under water since
1985,'' he said. ``I'd just sit there on the beach and study and
think. I guess I looked like a vagrant to some people.''
   Eventually, Valence designed a ``T'' shaped jetty, the arms
intended to disrupt the relocation of wave energy. He planned it to
let 15 percent of the energy penetrate the barrier, with a plastic
mat under the jetty to prevent undercutting.
   It took him a year to get a permit to build the jetty. He raised
$135,000 by charging $500 to put people's names on rocks. Then, he
sent Grand Isle High School art students to a marble company to
learn how to engrave names on rocks.
   The state paid $250,000 and the federal government put up
$100,000 for the jetty.
   So far, the jetty has cost $456,000, but the underpinning must
be completed, and there are other costs to be met. Valence plans a
``rock concert'' to raise more money.
   ``If I had a horse and some dogs, I'd do a dog and pony show,''
he said.
   Critics fear the jetty is rebuilding the middle of the island at
the expense of a state park at the eastern end, robbing the park of
drifting sand.
   ``It won't cause erosion at the park, but it will slow
accretion,'' Valence said. ``The park already extends out 200 feet.
They don't need another grain of sand.''
   The jetty has yet to face its most severe test _ a major
hurricane.

   Police appealed to the man who shot and killed a
subway robber to come forward, saying they know he was a victim.
   ``This is not the Bernhard Goetz case,'' Brooklyn Chief of
Detectives Joseph DeMartino said Friday. ``This is an individual
who is clearly being robbed, has lost his property, has been beaten
and draws a weapon and shoots his assailant.''
   The man pulled a gun and opened fire on a group of attackers
Thursday night in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, killing
one of them and scattering the others, police said. The man got off
at the next stop and vanished.
   Detectives combed through trash cans and along subway tracks and
gutters in downtown Brooklyn searching for the gunman's wallet,
which was stolen during the struggle, according to witnesses.
Police also said a friend of the shot robber might have taken the
wallet.
   The shooting was being compared to the 1984 Goetz subway
shooting case. As in the Goetz case, the shooter was white and the
youths he confronted were black.
   But police don't believe Thursday's shooting was racially
motivated. And they noted that Goetz had not been robbed _ he
believed he was about to be _ while several witnesses Thursday saw
a gang of youths attack the gunman.
   Goetz, now 42, made headlines when he shot four youths in a
subway car on the morning of Dec. 22, 1984. He claimed the group
was about to mug him; the youths claimed they were panhandling.
   Goetz fled but surrendered to police in New Hampshire nine days
later. He eventually was acquitted of attempted murder, but
convicted of a weapons possession charge. He wound up serving 8{
months in jail after losing a lengthy legal battle that reached the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   Police did not know yet whether the gunman in Thursday's
shooting was carrying his weapon legally.
   The slain robber was identified as Ricky Pickett, 25. A watch
with a torn band, believed to belong to the gunman, was found in
Pickett's pocket, police Capt. Stephen Davis said.
   Pickett, who also used five other names, had served jail time
for some of his half-dozen robbery convictions dating back to 1980,
according to police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The subway shooter was described as 45 to 55 years old, 5 feet
10 inches, with gray hair, wearing a beige raincoat and brown pants
and carrying a canvas gym bag.
   The shooting occurred in front of at least 20 people, while
Pickett was among a group of 14 youths heading to a Times Square
disco, police said.
   At least one of the two independent witnesses told police they
saw members of the group passing a gun around, Davis said. The gun
was not used in the robbery, police said, but a witness said the
robbers had a retractable razor.
   The four or five robbers grabbed the man, went through his
pockets, took his wallet and threw him back on the seat, police
said.
   ``The male fought them off, kicking out at them, and witnesses
state he drew a gun from his waistband and shot one of his
assailants,'' DeMartino said.
   One bullet hit Pickett in the chest, police said. The path of
the other two shots was not known.
   The mortally wounded Pickett, and the other men, fled into the
next car. The gunman and most of the youths left at the next
station, leaving Pickett dying on the train.

   Loggers, mill workers and their families
fear they will be forgotten under an emerging national policy to
limit logging of never-cut timber to protect spotted owls.
   On Friday, 8,000 to 10,000 people rallied in Pioneer Square to
protest the policy.
   Clad in yellow caps and ribbons, the ralliers heard U.S. Sen.
Bob Packwood, R-Ore., tell them the agenda of environmentalists
could be condensed into two words: ``No jobs.''
   Environmentalists argue that old-growth timber in the Northwest
must be protected to save the northern spotted owl from extinction.
They say the forest owl cannot survive outside the complex
ecosystem anchored by centuries-old trees.
   But Oregonians at the rally, and some of their elected
officials, echoed Packwood's economic fears.
   ``We think this potentially could have the largest impact on the
Northwest since the Depression, economically,'' Douglas County
Commissioner Doug Robertson said.
   ``It's come to the point that if we don't stand up and be
counted, we're going to suffer the consequences, and the
consequences are going to be severe.''
   A panel of scientists recommended to Congress on April 4 that
millions of acres of Northwest old-growth forest be set aside as
owl habitat. The exact locations of the habitat are under study.
Packwood wants Congress to reduce the amount of recommended forest
that would be set aside for the owl.
   It's up to Congress to decide by this fall how much of the
region's old-growth timber can be cut and how much owl habitat
should be protected.
   Organizers of the rally said 350 businesses around the state
closed so their employees could attend. Some schools gave students
excused absences so they could join their parents.
   Officials of Douglas County, rated by the U.S. Forest Service as
the most timber-dependent county in Oregon, gave 25 to 30 county
workers the day off with pay so they could attend the rally. In the
Linn County community of Sweet Home, 105 businesses closed and
about 500 people made the 85-mile trip to Portland.
   Bob and Susan Kasting, owners of the Busy Bee restaurant in
Sweet Home, joined the caravan. Kasting said a shutdown of the
timber industry would devastate his business.
   ``If they can't work, they can't eat,'' he said.
   Police reported several scuffles between environmentalists and
timber industry supporters on the edge of the crowd. The odor of
smoke bombs wafted across the square.
   Portland police spokesman Dave Simpson said officers took three
people who appeared to be timber industry supporters into custody.
The three seemed to be intoxicated and were held until they could
sober up, but weren't charged with any crimes, Simpson said.
   During the rally, dozens of log trucks circled downtown on the
freeways, occasionally blowing their horns.
   Evelyn Badger of the Oregon Lands Coalition, a pro-industry
group that organized the rally, said Congress would be asked to set
aside forest land specifically for timber harvests.
   ``We are the dirty-hands people who feed, clothe and shelter
this nation,'' she said.

   The new couple at the condominium
complex are doing just ducky, thanks.
   But the neighbors aren't too happy.
   Ever since two small mallards showed up, 197 residents of the
Laurelmont complex have been trying to figure how to make them
leave. The male paddles around the swimming pool's deep end. The
female sits on her eggs in the bushes behind a chaise lounge.
   Now, Orange County health officials are threatening to shut down
the pool just as the weather is heating up because the chlorine
level is unbalanced.
   But the ducks are untouchable.
   State and federal law says no one can ``tamper, bother, harass,
move or kill any migratory birds, their babies or nests,'' said
Linda Evans, executive director of an organization called Pacific
Wildlife Project.
   Violation of the law could bring a one-year prison term or a
$10,000 fine.
   ``It's mushrooming into quite a problem,'' said Lisle Starbuck,
vice president of Assured Property Management, the complex manager.
   ``I have homeowners who want to use the pool (who aren't happy)
swimming around in duck doo and others with guns who want to
protect the ducks.''
   The next step is for a warden from the state Department of Fish
and Game to come out and make a decision.

   In the future, critics of artist Jim Elniski may
call this year his hair period.
   Elniski is busy collecting hair from 96 beauty salons and barber
shops for a 9-foot-by-12-foot room he plans to wallpaper in hair.
   The work will be called ``The Neighborhood.''
   ``Neighborhoods are a categorical way of organizing people but
also separating them,'' Elniski said Friday. ``The hair is a common
denominator.''
   Elniski, 39, has persuaded hair cutters across the city to turn
over their clippings. He has collected about eight bushels of hair
so far.
   The artist plans to glue hair to four walls, creating an
abstract design he will set, probably with unscented hair spray. A
photograph of each hair-cutting establishment will be displayed on
the outside of the room, along with a listing of the neighborhoods
they are in.
   When people walk into the room through a door cut in one of the
walls, Elniski hopes they will realize their ``shared animal
nature.''
   ``We all, just in being alive, create this substance,'' he said.
``We all have this hair.''

<TEXT>
   A ``light'' earthquake has occurred along the
U.S.-Canadian border, the U.S. Geological Survey said early today.
   The tremor occurred at 10:33 p.m. local time, or 1:33 a.m. EDT,
about 50 miles southeast of Vancouver, British Columbia, and 20
miles northeast of Bellingham, Wash., said USGS spokesman Donald
Finley.
   Earthquake monitors at the survey's National Earthquake
Information Center in Golden, Colo., recorded the movement at a
preliminary magnitude of 4.5 on the Richter scale, Finley said.
That magnitude is considered ``light,'' meaning it can cause some
minor damage, Finley said.
   The quake was reported felt as far south as Seattle, 100 miles
south of the border, he said.
   The USGS had received no reports on damage or injuries.

   An Indonesian communications
satellite is back in space 5{ years after shuttle astronauts pulled
it from orbit and brought it back to Earth.
   ``I am very excited. I pray to God'' everything continues to go
well, said Makarim Wibisono, press consulate for the Indonesian
Embassy in Washington. She witnessed Friday's launch.
   An unmanned Delta 2 rocket blasted off on time at 6:28 p.m. with
the $60 million satellite from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
The satellite separated 26 minutes later and, as expected, settled
into orbit about 115 miles away.
   ``It looks like we have a normal vehicle on our hand,'' said
Skip Mackey, a NASA test director.
   An on-board kick motor was to boost the 1,437-pound satellite
into its final geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above the equator
Sunday.
   The Palapa B-2R satellite was one of two rescued from a
uselessly low orbit by the shuttle Discovery in November 1984. The
rescue came nine months after the satellites were launched by NASA
aboard Challenger. Astronauts Joe Allen and Dale Gardner manually
placed the satellites in Discovery's payload bay.
   The second satellite, originally built for Western Union, was
returned to space on a Chinese ``Long March 3'' rocket on April 7.
The successful sendoff marked China's debut into the international
satellite launching business.
   The refurbished Indonesian satellite will join two other Palapa
satellites already in orbit, electronically linking the 177 million
people who live on the country's 13,677 islands. It is expected to
go into operation in six weeks.
   The Indonesian satellites also will be used for internal
communications services in the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore and Papua New Guinea.
   Hughes Aircraft Co., which built the recovered Palapa, replaced
its batteries, on-board thrusters and motors used to boost the
satellite into its proper orbit. Damage during its nine months in
space was ``amazingly benign,'' said Dave Braverman, a vice
president for Hughes.
   Friday's launch cost $137.5 million, including $50 million for
the McDonnell Douglas Commercial rocket and $27.5 million for an
insurance premium covering loss of the satellite.
   The satellite originally was scheduled for launch April 9. The
launch was pushed back three days when the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration moved up the date of Discovery's launch with
the Hubble Space Telescope.
   The Palapa's launch was delayed yet again _ to Friday _ when
Discovery's mission was scrubbed Tuesday. The space agency later
said the Discovery mission would be delayed until April 25.
   The Palapa B-2R is the fourth Palapa satellite to be launched by
McDonnell Douglas. It is the Huntington Beach, Calif., company's
third commercial launch.

<HEAD>Officials Declare Crop Quarantine in Medfly Area</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture officials declared a quarantine
on commercially grown crops on 81 square miles in Riverside County
because a Medfly was discovered in an orange tree.
   The Mediterranean fruit fly was found Thursday in a commercial
orange grove in Woodcrest, sparking concerns that the
crop-destroying insect has established itself in the agricultural
region, state officials said Friday.
   The officials Friday also announced the discovery of two other
Medflies, one in an area of Glendora already sprayed by the
pesticide malathion in a controversial program aimed at protecting
crops against the insect.
   The other Medfly was found in suburban Walnut, in an area which
has not been sprayed.
   The discoveries prompted the state's science advisors to call a
meeting for Monday to decide how to respond.
   The Medflies were found less than a month after agricultural
officials announced they would try to halt aerial malathion
spraying in May and battle the pest with sterile flies.
   The state Department of Agriculture has been spraying malathion
over nearly 400 square miles of suburban Los Angeles and Orange
counties to battle an infestation that turned up last summer.
   Medflies lay eggs in more than 200 fruits and vegetables.
   The discovery of the Medfly in the Riverside County orange tree
was particularly unsettling.
   The region's navel oranges have already been picked and the
area's grapefruits and Valencia oranges won't be picked until
mid-summer. But officials worried about the economic impact of a
serious infestation.
   The quarantine is expected to let the fruit be sold within the
United States, but some foreign countries, including Japan, may not
accept fruit grown in an infested area, officials said.
   The exact boundaries of the quarantine were to be set Monday.
   It was not immediately known whether officials would order
pesticide spraying in the area. A Medfly had been found in the same
community on March 21, but no spraying was ordered.
   ``Since that is the second fly they've found out there,
(pesticide) treatment is a possibility,'' said Medfly project
spokeswoman Natalie Bosecker.
   Many residents have objected to having their homes sprayed at
night with malathion from helicopters out of fear the pesticide was
unhealthful and the helicopters could crash.
   State officials have said the pesticide is sprayed in safe,
small amounts and have defended the safety record of the company
contracted to fly the helicopters.

   A measure of calm returned to this northern
New Jersey community but more discrepancies emerged today between
police and witness accounts of the fatal shooting of a black
teen-ager by a white police officer.
   Scores of black college students marched for racial
understanding Friday and police continued to arrest individuals
suspected of participating in Wednesday's looting and violence
stemming from the shooting of Phillip Pannell.
   Pannell, 16, of nearby River Edge, was shot and killed Tuesday
night by Teaneck police officer Gary Spath, who was responding to
an anonymous telephone tip that a teen-ager had drawn a gun on
another youth.
   Spath has since been suspended with pay and Officer Wayne
Blanco, who responded with Spath, has been temporarily relieved of
his duties, acting Bergen County Prosecutor John Holl said.
   ``Tensions are still high .. it's going to be an emotional
weekend,'' said Walter Fields, an official with the Bergen County
chapter of the NAACP, as he marched with 200 students along Teaneck
Road, where the windows of a dozen businesses were shattered
Wednesday night during several hours of looting and violence.
   ``We don't condone the violence but we do thoroughly understand
the anger,'' said Fields.
   Companions of the slain youth said he had been handling a BB
pistol when police approached him and other youths, and that he put
it in his coat and ran away with it before police frisked him, The
New York Times reported today. An adult witness said Pannell was
shot as he lept over a hedge.
   Police have said Blanco did frisk Pannell and felt in Pannell's
coat a heavy object he suspected was a gun. Police also have said
they recovered a loaded .22-caliber gun from Pannell.
   Michelle Ortiz, 15, told the Times that about 20 youths were
hanging out in a park before the shooting.
   ``Phil took a BB gun and was fooling around with it,'' passing
it back and forth with another friend, Ms. Ortiz said.
   She said two police cars screeched to a halt in the park, and
one officer jumped out of each car, pointing pistols at the youths
and shouting ``Freeze! Get your hands up!''
   Police shuffled some of the youths toward a wall, but Pannell
ran and police chased him, the Times quoted Jonathon Owen, 15, and
Shawn Robinson, 14, as saying in separate interviews.
   An adult who lives across the street from the shooting scene,
Jennifer Bradley, said Pannell was shot as he ran down a driveway.
   ``I was shouting, `Don't shooot him, don't shoot him.' The
second guy, fatter, shot him in the back,'' Bradley said.
   An autopsy by the Bergen County medical examiner showed Pannell
was shot once in the back. Police said an investigation showed that
Spath's .38-caliber service revolver had been fired twice, and that
Blanco's revolver was not fired.
   A grand jury is scheduled to begin hearing testimony on the case
on Tuesday.
   A peaceful candlelight vigil Wednesday night in remembrance of
the slain youth turned violent as mostly black teen-agers roamed
local streets smashing store windows and overturning cars. Five
people have been arrested so far.

<HEAD>Intra-Christian Fighting Continues, France Urges Aoun to Step Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian troops battled with tank
cannons in east Beirut today, and a newspaper reported that France
was pressing renegade Gen. Michel Aoun to give up his struggle for
power.
   At least three people were wounded in the one-hour flareup on
the edge of Ashrafiyeh, a residential district controlled by Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia, police said.
   The thuds of exploding rounds and staccato bursts of machine-gun
fire echoed across Beirut. Both sides blamed the other for the
clash.
   The morning flareup subsided into occasional exchanges of sniper
fire an hour later, although no cease-fire agreement was announced.
   By police count, the showdown between Aoun and Geagea for
control of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave has killed 875
people and wounded 2,372 since it broke out Jan. 30.
   Sixteen cease-fire accords arranged by independent Christian
figures have silenced the intra-Christian confrontation for periods
ranging from a few hours to several days.
   Meanwhile, An-Nahar, a respected, independent newspaper, said
France was trying to persuade Aoun to renounce any claims to the
Christian sector in favor of Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi.
   The report, quoting unidentified sources, said French Ambassador
Rene Ala held a three-hour meeting with Aoun Friday in which he
relayed the French advice ``to step down.''
   France, which ruled Lebanon until the nation's independence in
1943, is the traditional patron of Lebanon's Christian population.
   The French effort, the paper said, was coordinated with Saudi
Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, the three Arab states that brokered a
peace accord last October to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   The accord, worked out by Lebanese legislators at the Saudi
resort of Taif, called for the equal distribution of power among
Moslems and Christians.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronite Catholics, the largest
Christian sect in Lebanon. The sect has dominated the nation's
political life since independence.
   Aoun, the Lebanese army commander at the time, rejected the Taif
accord and the Nov. 24 election of Hrawi as President. Aoun held
out in the shell-shattered presidential palace in suburban Baabda
in the Christian enclave east of Beirut.
   Hrawi was forced to set up temporary headquarters in
Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut. Hrawi's government, led by Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, has repeatedly referred to
Aoun as a ``power usurper.''
   Arab League envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi, currently in Lebanon with
new proposals to help Hrawi remove obstacles blocking
implementation of the Taif accord, said he will not meet with Aoun.
   Geagea has recognized Hrawi as head of state and invited his
government to take over army camps and government offices in areas
of his control in the Christian enclave.

<HEAD>Ruling Party Picks New Central Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's ruling Communist Party has named a
new, smaller Central Committee and will remove 80 percent of old
committee members from office, China's official Xinhua News Agency
said today.
   Earlier, at an extraordinary four-day congress of the Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party, leaders adopted a new party
constitution and platform that reflected the recent acceptance of
democratic reforms and opposition parties.
   The congress ended on Friday.
   Xinhua said the party's Central Committee was trimmed to 91
members from 146. Delegates said younger, more educated people
would comprise much of the committee.
   The 926 congress delegates also chose a new leadership body, to
be renamed the Presidium instead of the current Politburo. But the
Presidium was to consist of the same five men appointed to the
Politburo less than a month ago after an opposition hunger strike
forced out the old party leadership.
   The chairman of the Presidium, Gombojavyn Ochirbat, 61, was
named party chief a month ago amid a leadership shakeup triggered
by pro-democracy protests.
   The Communists have ruled this Soviet-allied pastoral nation
with an iron grip since 1921, when the Soviets helped Mongolia gain
independence from China. Protests for reform began in December,
inspired by Soviet glasnost and the fall of Communist parties in
Eastern Europe.
   On March 23, the parliament abolished the Communist Party's
monopoly on power and approved free Parliamentary elections,
tentatively scheduled for July.
   Earlier in the congress, the party, seeking to change its image
and maintain control after the elections, dropped the word
``communism'' from its constitution and set a new goal of building
``democratic, human socialism.''
   The new party constitution adopted also cuts the number of party
employees, gives more financial and decision-making power to local
party and guarantees their right to criticize the center.
   Xinhua said the congress also decided to set up a commission to
investigate former high-ranking officials. The opposition has
charged former leaders with corruption and persecution of
dissidents.
   The report said the delegates agreed to postpone the party's
next congress, scheduled for November, until next year.

<HEAD>McDonald's Warns Papers Against Critical Ad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-cholesterol crusader says he'll continue
his battle for the good diet, despite McDonald's Corp.'s claim that
ads he placed in the nation's newspapers are misleading and
malicious.
   ``We will continue to warn the American public about the dangers
of high cholesterol,'' Phil Sokolof, an Omaha industrialist out to
change the nation's eating habits, said Friday.
   Sokolof placed advertisements in newspapers nationwide April 4,
asking McDonald's Corp. to lower the amount of saturated fat on its
menu. The ads, headlined ``The Poisoning of America!'' included a
plea to McDonald's to cut the fat in their hamburgers by 10 percent.
   But McDonald's said Friday the ad was inaccurate. Attorney
Joseph Califano, who represents McDonald's, said letters have been
written to newspapers advising them not to publish it again.
   ``We think the papers just didn't check the facts,'' said
Califano, secretary of health, education and welfare in the Carter
administration.
   ``Now they know the facts, now they are all on notice. ... To
publish anything like that ad would be a malicious act,'' Califano
said.
   McDonald's said the ad was riddled with error.
   ``Just about everything in the ad except the spelling of
McDonald's was inaccurate,'' said Chuck Ebeling, a spokesman for
the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company.
   Sokolof, reached in Omaha, said McDonald's was putting up a
``smokescreen'' and that the ad was a public service.
   ``McDonald's has chosen to try and intimidate the nation's
leading newspapers,'' said Sokolof, who blames a bad diet for a
heart attack he suffered years ago.
   He would not rule out placing more ads in the future, but would
not reveal any specific plans.
   Ebeling said the ad ``blatantly overstated'' the saturated fat
content of McDonald's products, including an assertion that
McDonald's precooked hamburger meat is 21.5 percent fat.
   ``In reality, the fat content before cooking is 17 to 20 percent
fat and is typically 19.5 percent fat,'' Ebeling said.
   An official of a Washington, D.C.-based consumer advocacy group,
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said either way the
saturated fat levels in fast food are too high.
   ``To me, the important part is that the general thrust of the ad
was correct,'' said nutrition director Bonnie Liebman. ``Many of
the foods served at McDonald's are loaded with saturated fat and
cholesterol and eating less would reduce heart disease _ the
nation's largest killer.
   ``A 10 percent reduction would still leave us with pretty fatty
sandwiches, but it's a start,'' she said.
   Ebeling said McDonald's has worked over the past several years
to develop a more healthy menu that now includes salads, 2 percent
milk, and bran muffins.
   The company is also experimenting with using pure vegetable oil
_ rather than the current beef shortening-vegetable oil mixture _
for frying its french fries and hash browns.

<HEAD>Boeing to Build New Folding-Wing Jet with Japanese Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co., three years behind competitors
in developing a new, mid-size commercial jet, plans to make a
folding-wing plane with three Japanese companies as suppliers.
   The agreement announced Friday lets the Japanese aerospace firms
make about one-fifth of the plane's components and share roughly
the same proportion of risk without holding an equity position,
Boeing officials said.
   The 353-seat jet would fill a size gap between the Boeing 767
and the Boeing 747 jets, company officials said. It would be larger
than the 767 and smaller than the 747.
   That would put the new airplane, the so-called 767-X, in
competition with models made by McDonnell Douglas and the European
consortium Airbus Industrie. Both have been developing planes of
similar range and size for about three years.
   The Japanese companies would be contractors for _ not partners
in _ the project. But they will be able to capitalize their share
of earnings from the new plane, Boeing officials said.
   ``I think this is the first time we've gone this far. ... But
their participation would be limited a great degree over what it
would have been if they had been an equity partner,'' said Lawrence
W. Clarkson, senior vice president for government and international
affairs of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
   A memorandum of understanding was signed Thursday between Boeing
and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji
Heavy Industries. A final agreement was expected this summer.
   Boeing hopes to announce orders for the new plane this year and
begin deliveries in 1995. The plane is to be renamed the 777 once
in production.
   Clarkson said the Japanese companies would make 15 percent to 20
percent of the new airframe.
   He said an equity arrangement with the Japanese is possible on
future projects.
   Estimates that the initial investment to develop the plane would
be about $3 billion were ``probably close, within a billion or
so,'' Clarkson said.
   Some trade experts have expressed fear that Japan would use
proprietary information as it tries to become an aerospace power.
Clarkson said that fear is not valid.
   ``We're not afraid of the Japanese,'' he said. ``The issue of
technology transfer that has been so highly speculated about we
believe is not a valid issue.''
   The initial model would have a 197-foot wingspan, would be 206
feet long and carry passengers in two classes. It would have a
range of 4,600 nautical miles, said Alan R. Mulally, vice president
for engineering of Boeing's New Airplane Division.
   Mulally said the plane is designed to replace the 687 McDonnell
Douglas DC-10s and Lockheed L-1011s that will be approaching 25
years of age in the mid-1990s.
   The wings of the new jet would be able to fold upward about 23
to 25 feet from the tips, letting it use existing airport gates for
older models, which have shorter wings.
   Clarkson said the Japanese would produce about the same
components for the new plane as they now do for the 767. Production
of wings and other key technologically advanced parts will remain
with Boeing, he said.

<HEAD>High School Student Suspended For Notebook Entries Files Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high school sophomore contends in a federal
lawsuit that her free-speech rights were violated when she was
suspended for allegedly writing menacing and obscene messages in a
notebook circulated by students.
   The notebook contained at least two death threats against
teachers and included gruesome references to chopping an
administrator into pieces and wishing to castrate a teacher,
officials said.
   Heather Gilbertson, one of four Reno High School students
suspended for two days last month, filed the U.S. District Court
lawsuit Friday against the Washoe County School District and
officials on behalf of herself and other pupils.
   She said students' constitutional rights to free speech and free
expression were abused by school officials in trying to control
student writings in the notebook, called ``The Not-So-Sacred Note
Flow, Jr.''
   The notebook hasn't been made public.
   The suspensions were ``intended to allow educators to exercise
control over student expression and allow educators to police
thought and restrict speech in this form,'' said the lawsuit filed
by attorney Jack Schroeder of Reno.
   ``This wasn't a publication; it was a communications system,
just like notes being passed between students,'' Schroeder said.
``Some students may have said some strong things about teachers but
to my knowledge there was never any follow up or intent to follow
up.''
   The lawsuit seeks a court order to forbid the school district
from continuing to limit student speech by punishing students for
writings.
   Steve Mulvenon, spokesman for the school district, said the
students were disciplined because of the nature of the messages.
   ``The circulation of that notebook had created a climate in the
school that the principal thought was not conducive to a good
education,'' Mulvenon said. ``The notebook was violent, threatening
against teachers and staff and also used language that was
offensive and personally invasive.''
   Mulvenon said he wasn't surprised by the lawsuit and he welcomes
the opportunity to ``see whether what the school district did was
within our rights or not.''
   The spiral notebook was discovered when a student left it in a
classroom and a teacher turned it into Principal Patrick Rogan, who
decided the students' punishment.
   Students have said they didn't mean any harm by the notebook
which included a passage explaining what the purpose of the
journal. It says, in part, ```The Flow' is a place to voice
feelings, read what other people have to say, get and give advice,
and communicate on a different level of life. It's a place to
reveal your personal insights on anything, and get feedback to what
you say.''

   More than 34,000 Japanese fans reveled to the
sounds of Madonna as the pop music star opened her second Japan
tour, but nearby residents complained of the din.
   Incessant rain didn't stop fans from pouring into the outdoor
Chiba Marine Stadium, 21 miles outside of Tokyo, for the two-hour
performance Friday night.
   Stripping to metallic lingerie, which Japanese newspapers
alternately called gold and silver, Madonna sang 18 songs,
including longtime hits ``Like a Virgin,'' ``Material Girl'' and
``Holiday.''
   Newspapers commented that she even tried to orientalize her hit
``Like a Prayer,'' although they described the rendition as more
reminiscent of Chinese, rather than Japanese, music.
   The tabloid Nikkan Sports said Friday night's performance, the
first of nine in Japan, revealed a new Madonna to local fans.
   ``Although she possessed the same lingerie look as three years
ago, the meticulous composition and staging of her performance was
completely different.''
   Not everyone was pleased with the performance, however.
   Local police counted about 50 noise complaints from residents
living within one to two miles of the new stadium, which opened on
March 24.
   Madonna's first tour to Japan in 1987 also was marred by bad
weather. Heavy rains and strong winds on the night of one
performance forced her to cancel a concert, causing a stampede by
enraged fans.
   After the concert, 48-year-old office worker Kazunari Igarashi
even filed a suit against the singer, asking for $57 in mental
damages and a makeup concert. Tokyo District Court rejected the
suit.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Pakistan Moving Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh said today
Pakistan has moved radar units and armored regiments close to the
Indian border and is readying its airfields.
   He said India would be prepared for ``any eventuality'' with
Pakistan.
   Meanwhile, tension was high today in Jammu-Kashmir, the main
issue between the countries because of a Moslem separatist movement
in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir.
   Speaking to reporters, Singh said Pakistan had already ``sounded
a red alert, which is the last word'' regarding war preparations.
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said there were signs of
``war clouds hanging over the country.''
   But in Islamabad, a Foreign Ministry official called the
allegations a ``figment of V.P. Singh's imagination'' and said the
Indian prime minister's statements proved his country is trying to
provoke war.
   ``India cannot accept the fact that the Kashmiris want their
freedom and they are not only trying to oppress this movement but
to start another war and blame us,'' the official said on condition
of anonymity.
   Pakistan's prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has denied charges of
aiding separatists but said Pakistan supports the rights of the
Kashmiris to self-determination.
   Today, Ms. Bhutto's archrival said the political opposition
would set aside its differences with the government to defend the
country against attack by India.
   ``The present challenge requires us to face it as a united and
spirited nation,'' said Nawaz Sharif, the powerful chief minister
of Punjab and leader of the right-wing opposition alliance.
   In Jammu-Kashmir, a grenade thrown by militants exploded near an
army truck, injuring three soldiers. Police said the attack
occurred outside Srinagar, the troubled Indian state's capital and
focus of a Moslem separatist movement.
   An around-the-clock curfew entered its eighth day in Srinagar.
Police arrested 100 people in their search for the killers of three
kidnap victims.
   The bullet-ridden bodies of L.M. Khera, general manager of the
Hindustan Machine Tools. Co., Kashmir University Vice Chancellor
Mushir Ul-haq and his secretary were found earlier this week.
   Moslem separatists had demanded the release of three jailed
militants in exchange for the men, but the government refused.
   In Bhaderwah, 125 miles north of the capital, a man wounded in a
security forces attack Friday died of bullet injuries this morning.
At least 270 people have been killed since the government launched
a crackdown on Moslem militants in the state in January.
   In Srinagar, army vehicles traveled door to door offering food
to residents who have been forced to stay indoors since April 7, a
day after the kidnappings. But residents in several sections of the
city refused the food. They, too, shouted anti-government slogans
and called for independence for Kashmir.
   In the past week police have detained more than 1,000 people,
mostly young men and boys, in their search for the kidnappers,
security officials said on condition of anonymity.
   On Friday, Moslem militants kidnapped a former member of the
state legislature. Amirullah Khan, 75, was abducted from his home
in Shopian, 40 miles northeast of Srinagar. Khan is a member of
Gandhi's Congress Party.
   Kashmir is disputed by India and Pakistan. Since the two
countries won independence in 1947 from British colonial rule,
India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the region.
   Kashmir is now divided by a cease-fire line monitored by the
United Nations.
   Moslem separatists in Kashmir say they want an independent
country, attached neither to Moslem Pakistan nor India.
   India's population is 82 percent Hindu, and Jammu-Kashmir state
is the only state with a Moslem majority. Moslems account for 64
percent of the state's 6 million people and Hindus make up 34
percent. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880
milion people.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Criticized for Transferring Mapplethorpe Case To City
Prosecutors</HEAD>

   Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney is
trying to deflect criticism for dropping out of the obscenity case
against an art gallery showing the late Robert Mapplethorpe's
sexually explicit photographs.
   The Contemporary Art Center and its director were indicted one
week ago on misdemeanor obscenity charges for displaying seven
photos that show naked children or homoerotic acts.
   Mayor Charles Luken said Friday he thinks Ney sent the case to
city prosecutors because he doubted he could win. But Ney said
Thursday that his county office is barred by Ohio law from
prosecuting misdemeanor cases.
   ``I think this is a politically hot potato, and the reason Mr.
Ney is doing this is that he doesn't feel he can win,'' Luken said.
   Ney's assistant, Chip Gerhardt, denied that the county
prosecutor had withdrawn because he thought he would lose. ``The
law is clear on this, and Mr. Luken's a lawyer and he should
understand the law,'' Gerhardt said.
   City Council members Guy Guckenberger and David Mann, both of
whom are lawyers, said the city should drop the case if the county
refuses to pursue it.
   ``I have no interest in paying hundreds of thousands of dollars
for this litigation,'' Guckenberger said. ``We have much more
important priorities in the city.''
   A survey published Friday by The Cincinnati Post found that 59
percent of Cincinnati residents support the Arts Center in
displaying the photographs, and 38 percent said the show should be
prohibited.
   ``These numbers shatter the myth that this is a heavily
conservative community,'' said Al Tuchfarber, director of the
University of Cincinnati's Institute for Policy Research, which
conducted the survey for the Post.
   The telephone poll of 561 adults in Hamilton County on Wednesday
and Thursday found that 96 percent of those surveyed had heard
about or seen the Mapplethorpe exhibit since it opened April 6. The
poll's margin of sampling error was 4 percent.
   About 18,000 people have viewed the 175-photograph exhibit since
it opened April 6.
   A county grand jury indicted the Arts Center and its director,
Dennis Barrie, last Saturday on misdemeanor charges of pandering
obscenity and using children in nudity-related material.
   Barrie and the gallery are to be arraigned Monday. If convicted,
Barrie could be sentenced to six months in jail on each of the two
counts.

   A group of renegade soldiers told the
British Embassy today that it would attack alleged British
mercenaries training President Corazon Aquino's security guard.
   Meanwhile, another underground military group said that if the
U.S. government continues intervening in Philippine affairs
Washington officials may face ``a fight they will never forget.''
   The Revolutionary Alliance for the Masses-Soldiers of the
Filipino People distributed a statement with the U.S. warning today
outside the Philippine Constabulary jail, where leaders of past
coup attempts were held.
   ``The U.S. government will be solely responsible for whatever
actions we might consider to take against them,'' the statement
said. It referried to U.S. air support for Mrs. Aquino's forces
during the Dec. 1-9 failed coup attempt that left more than 113
people dead and over 600 wounded.
   The warning to the British Embasy by the Young Officers Union,
one of several underground right-wing military groups plotting
against Mrs. Aquino, came in an open letter. Copies were sent to
news agencies.
   The letter, dated Friday, was signed by Capt. Carlos Maglalang.
Military spokesmen said there was no officer in the armed forces by
that name.
   The Soldiers Union said it had identified the alleged British
mercenaries and traced where they were staying. It urged the
British Embassy to order them out of the Philippines, saying
otherwise they would face ``drastic action.''
   The group said that on Wednesday and Thursday British military
instructors joined troops from Mrs. Aquino's Presidential Security
guard in staging mock attacks on the palace, the airport and the
House of Representatives building.
   Horacio Paredes, a spokesman for Mrs. Aquino, confirmed the
presidential guard held military exercises on those days but
declined comment on whether British nationals were involved.
   It could not be determined whether the letter had reached the
British Embassy because its offices were closed for the four-day
Easter holiday. Telephone calls to the embassy went unanswered.
   ``Our forces in Manila have closely monitored the activities of
these mercenaries,'' the letter said, adding they represented ``a
direct intervention in the country's internal security affairs and
a clear violation of Philippine sovereignty.''
   On Wednesday, military officials warned the government about the
possibility of new attempts by renegade troops to topple the
government.
   There have been about six right-wing military bids to oust Mrs.
Aquino since she took office in a 1986 civilian-military uprising
that deposed Ferdinand Marcos.

<HEAD>Attendance, And Controversy, Increase At France's Bullrings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHE CACHERA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's bullfight season opened today with both
aficionados and critics intensifying lobbying campaigns in advance
of expected moves to outlaw the increasingly popular spectacle.
   The annual number of ``corridas'' _ programs of several
bullfights _ has doubled in the past decade to more than 120. Total
attendance last year was 600,000, and a national association of
fans has been formed to defend bullfighting.
   Animal protection groups, in turn, have escalated their
offensive against bullfighting. They want first to stop its spread,
and eventually to ban it.
   Bullfighting was introduced in France in 1853 at the urging of
Empress Eugenie, the Spanish-born wife of Napoleon III. Almost a
century later, in 1951, the government enshrined bullfighting in a
law that authorizes its continuation in towns where it qualifies as
a longstanding local tradition.
   That effectively limited corridas to southern cities and towns
such as Nimes and Arles, where Spanish immigrants have helped
kindle a passion for bullfighting.
   Attendance at French bullfights stagnated in the 1970s but began
increasing steadily in the mid-1980s. Attendance in Spain, the
world's bullfighting capital, also is rising.
   A recent survey taken by the French fans' association, the
National Association for the Defense of ``l'Aficion,'' indicated
that the spectators include large numbers of young people, many
with white-collar jobs.
   Promoters have succeeded in obtaining more media coverage for
bullfighting. The country's increasing popular pay-TV network,
Canal Plus, now shows highlights of bullfights, and the trendy
leftist Parisian daily Liberation devoted an entire page today to
the opening of the season.
   For Rene Berlandier, president of the fans' association, the
main problem facing bullfighting is excessively high ticket prices.
   Even with the influx of younger, better-educated fans, he said
the average ticket price of nearly $30 is a burden. According to
his group's polls, 33 percent of the fans have less than $1,700 in
annual disposable income.
   The growing popularity of bullfighting distresses France's
Society for the Protection of Animals.
   ``They have created a need in an artificial way,'' said the
society's president, Jacqueline Faucher, of the bullfight promoters.
   ``And they shouldn't talk to me about traditions. In this area,
it's the tradition of the cash-register above all.''
   She said the society objects to the idea that ``the agony and
the death of an animal should become a spectacle.''
   ``In the short term we want to ensure that corridas are truly
limited to towns where they are traditional, according to the law.
In the long term, we are battling for the prohibition, pure and
simple, of this barbarity.''
   The biggest threat to bullfighting could come from the European
Parliament, where deputies seeking to outlaw it may gain broader
powers as European integration increases after 1992.
   Thus far, French aficionados aren't overly worried by the
spectre of a ban. According to the survey taken by Berlandier's
group, their biggest worry for now is that the bulls are becoming
too feeble.

   Police arrested 361 protesters during a Good
Friday clash at a health center between pro-choice and
anti-abortion advocates.
   And in Southern California on Friday, 48 people were arrested in
Tustin when anti-abortion demonstrators blocked a medical clinic
during one of a series of Easter weekend protests planned by the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
   The arrests in Philadelphia came during an anti-abortion
demonstration at the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center as more than
500 pro-choice advocates lined the sidewalks in front of the
women's clinic to prevent abortion foes from closing the center.
   It was not clear how many of the people arrested were
anti-abortion demonstrators and how many were pro-choice.
   The demonstrators in Philadelphia were charged with obstructing
traffic, which was rerouted. They face fines of up to $300, police
said.
   ``We are allowed to break a law to save a life,'' said Gloria
Romana, 48, of Norristown. She said she had been arrested at least
18 times before during anti-abortion protests.
   The center regularly schedules abortions on Mondays, Fridays and
Saturdays.
   In California, Operation Rescue members clashed with pro-choice
advocates at Doctors Family Planning clinic in the Orange County
city of Tustin, about 50 miles south of Los Angeles.
   Tustin Councilman John Kelly, who was defeated for re-election
last week and leaves office Tuesday, was among those arrested on a
misdemeanor trespassing charge. He is an abortion opponent.
   The charge is punishable by up to six months in jail and a
$1,000 fine.

<HEAD>Pope Sends Message to Lithuanian, Meets Top Gorbachev Aide</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Lithuania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II met unexpectedly today
with an aide to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, one day after the Soviet
president issued an ultimatum to the rebellious Baltic republic of
Lithuania.
   The pontiff also sent an Easter message to Lithuania, saying he
felt closer than ever to the aspirations of the Soviet republic's
largely Catholic people.
   A Vatican spokesman, Monsignor Piero Pennacchini, said the
private audience, which lasted 30 minutes, was requested by Vadim
Zagladin, a special adviser to the Soviet president.
   ``The visit to His Holiness is part of the contacts that have
been taken up again between the Holy See and the Soviet government
to deal with problems related to the life of the church in the
Soviet Union as well as the problems inherent to international
collaboration,'' Pennacchini said.
   He did not comment further on the meeting or say whether it
touched on the crisis in Lithuania, which declared independence
from Moscow on March 11. The meeting was not announced until
shortly before it took place.
   A week ago, the Holy See's envoy to Moscow, Archbishop Francesco
Colasuonno, said in an interview that the Vatican might be willing
to mediate in the dispute over Lithuania if asked to do so.
   Lithuania's president, Vytautas Landsbergis, said his republic
will not bend to Gorbachev's threat to cut off crucial supplies
such as oil if the republic does not rescind its strongest
independence measures by Sunday.
   Shortly before Pennacchini's statement, the Vatican released a
text of an Easter telegram sent today by the Polish pope to
Cardinal Vincentas Skadkevicius of Lithuania.
   ``In this hour of trepidation and hope, I am particularly near
to the Lithuanian church,'' he said.
   ``My affectionate solicitude embraces likewise all your noble
people to whose aspirations I have never been closer, especially in
this Easter period,'' the pope said, adding that he prayed that
``may providence support individuals and the people as a whole, the
fates of your dear nation.''
   The telegram, which ended with an apostolic blessing, was sent
in Latin. The Vatican released an Italian translation.
   The pope has disclosed on two occasions that he had been barred
from visiting Lithuania. Gorbachev invited the pope to the Soviet
Union when the Soviet president was received by John Paul at the
Vatican last year, but the pope has announced no commitment to
visit.
   Lithuania, an independent nation before World War II, was
occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940.

<HEAD>Germans Jam Borders For Holiday; Controversy on Monetary Union</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs at end to UPDATE with former East German defense
minister calling for drastic disarmament. TRIMS to tighten.
^By KEVIN COSTELLOE</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Germans from East and
West jammed border crossings for Easter weekend trips and the first
chance in decades to spend the holiday with relatives on the other
side.
   Meanwhile, officials haggled over the currency exchange rate for
a monetary union, one of the first steps toward German unification.
   East Germany's new government, headed by Lothar de Maiziere, on
Thursday eased passport checks to handle the holiday crush. Border
guards usually open passports to verify identification, but on
Friday they barely glanced at them.
   On Friday, the traditional start of the long Easter weekend,
bumper-to-bumper traffic stretching 40 miles was reported near the
West German city of Hanover.
   At the Helmstedt border crossing, police said traffic was moving
slowly and backed up for 30 miles.
   Many Germans seized their first chance in decades to spend
Easter with relatives on the other side. Others took advantage of
the long weekend to sightsee for the first time in their
neighboring state.
   Officials said most traffic was heading from west to east. East
Germany and East Berlin in general have become tourist meccas since
the nation's October revolution ended four decades of communism.
   West Germany's ARD television reported late Friday that some
travelers waited up to four hours to get gas at service stations
along routes in East Germany.
   Meanwhile, East Germany's new finance minister, Walter Romberg,
was quoted Friday as saying the West German government must
understand East Germans need a 1-to-1 exchange of money in the
monetary union planned for July 1.
   Romberg told West Germany's Die Welt newspaper that he could
foresee initially limiting the equal exchange to salaries and
retirement pay, and for savings accounts up to 7,000 marks.
   Die Welt quoted Romberg as saying an equal exchange for larger
amounts could be delayed until East Germany's economy is in better
shape.
   At a 1-to-1 exchange, 7,000 East German marks would be worth
$4,100. At the current exchange, the amount is worth about $1,370.
   Average salaries in East Germany are about 1,000 marks a month,
now worth $196. Retirement pay is about one-half that sum.
   Officials of West Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, have
proposed a 1-to-1 exchange rate for savings accounts up to 2,000
East German marks, or $1,175. The Bundesbank would make the rate
two East German marks for one West German mark in other cases.
   In another development, West Germany's foreign minister,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, called for a quick meeting with Markus
Meckel, East Germany's new foreign minister, to prepare a united
position for international talks on unification.
   The coming talks will include the two German states and the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France _ the World War
II Allies who defeated Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.
   A government newspaper in East Germany today quoted that
country's former defense minister, Theodor Hoffman, as saying the
military in both Germanys should ``set the pace to ease tensions
with drastic disarmament.''
   He did not elaborate.
   ``This would contribute to the peoples of Europe having no
grounds to fear German military might,'' the newspaper Neues
Deutschland quoted him as saying.
   West Germany has 400,000 soldiers and East Germany 180,000,
officials say.

<HEAD>Iran Papers Denounce Court Ruling on Rushdie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian newspaper said today that a
British court decision not to try Salman Rushdie, author of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' for blasphemy will block an improvement in
British-Iranian relations.
   The Persian-language daily, Jumhuri Islami, or Islamic Republic,
said Britain should realize there will be no flexibility from Iran
for improvement of ties unless Britain meets ``the demands of
Moslems.''
   It said that by neglecting Moslems' complaints, the British
tribunal showed it was a ``kangaroo court.''
   A British High Court last week rejected a bid by a Moslem group
to prosecute Rushdie and publishers Viking Penguin for blasphemy,
upholding a lower court decision that Britain's blasphemy laws
apply only to the Christian religion.
   ``More than 1 billion Moslems are enraged with the publication
of the blasphemous novel,'' the Iranian newspaper said. ``The
fascist government of Britain is once again making faces at Moslems
and displaying its hostility against Islam.''
   The English daily ``Kayhan International'' said today that
Rushdie is ``no more than a moving corpse,'' adding: ``His fate is
but certain death _ a fact that the British rulers have to accept
sooner or later.''
   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Moslems to kill
Rushdie, a British citizen born of an Indian Moslem family. The
death sentence was confirmed by Iranian leaders after Khomeini's
death in June.
   Excerpts of today's editorials were carried by the Islamic
Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.

   A small plane crashed near the Normandy
coast, killing all four people aboard and raining wreckage on a
town, authorities said today.
   The single-engine Beechcraft was en route from Britain to Spain,
where the four were to vacation, when it went down Friday in
Bayeux, 18 miles northwest of Caen, officials said.
   Witnesses said they heard an explosion, then saw debris falling
from the sky. Officials said debris was scattered in residential
areas and one body landed on a parked car.
   ``The fuselage fell less than 10 meters (yards) from a house and
about 100 meters from three service stations,'' one firefighter
said.
   No injuries were reported on the ground. The cause of the crash
was under investigation.
   The British pilot, 24-year-old Mark Lilley, died of his injuries
at a university hospital in Caen, said officials who by custom do
not identify themselves.
   The others, who died immediately, were identified as his
parents, Carolyn Lilley, 45, and Norman Lilley, 46, of Ampleforth
in York, and Mary Wilson, whose age and residence were unknown.

<TEXT>
   The anger and hope that burst forth when Hu
Yaobang died a year ago are muted now, stilled by a campaign of
political repression that seems only to intensify.
   Security has been tightened to prevent demonstrations marking
the April 15, 1989, death of the former Communist Party chief, a
popular reformer whose passing inspired a campaign for democratic
reform that ended in tragedy.
   Within hours of Hu's death, posters went up at Beijing
University and other campuses praising the leader who was purged in
1987 for not crushing student demonstrations.
   One said: ``Sincere men have died while hypocrites live on. Is
there any hope left for our country?''
   Thousands of students soon were marching on Tiananmen Square,
ostensibly to mourn Hu but also to decry with growing vehemence the
arrogance and corruption of one-party rule.
   As the weeks went on, factory workers, teachers, journalists and
even party members and police joined the peaceful, festive marches
for a more democratic government.
   On May 20, after Chinese leaders were humiliated by the student
occupation of Tiananmen Square during a visit by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, martial law was declared in Beijing.
   China's aging leadership, intimidated by the masses they claimed
to represent, declared that a plot was afoot against the party and
communism.
   Tens of thousands of Beijing residents filled the streets to
protect the students in the square.
   Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army smashed through the
barricades June 3-4 and shot their way to Tiananmen. Hundreds of
people, perhaps thousands, were killed.
   A year after the movement began, thousands of political
activists languish in Chinese jails, uncharged and without access
to legal advice.
   Numbing political indoctrination, a throwback to the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, continues unabated in schools and workplaces.
   Zhao Ziyang, purged as party chief in June for pro-student
leanings, remains under house arrest. Astrophysicist Fang Lizhi,
China's best-known dissident, is a fugitive in the U.S. Embassy.
   For the many Chinese who still sympathize with the democracy
movement's goals, and for the government they oppose, the common
denominator is fear.
   Students are frightened by threats of expulsion from school or
arrest if they demonstrate. One student said: ``If something
happens, people say they will join in, but no one is willing to
take the first step.''
   Authorities claim the social situation is stable, but worry that
reforms in Eastern Europe will come to haunt China.
   They have told young people to stay away from Tiananmen Square.
   Police closed the square to the public April 1 and again on
April 5, a festival day on which the Chinese traditionally honor
their dead. Overseas dissidents had urged people to stroll across
Tiananmen on those days to mourn the victims of the military
crackdown.
   Martial law was lifted in January, but more than 1,000 soldiers
are posted in the history museum on the east side of Tiananmen.
They march across the square each day chanting praise to socialism,
a warning that protests will not be tolerated in the square,
China's symbolic political center.
   ``We absolutely won't allow'' any repetition of last year's
protests, said Chen Xitong, the hard-line mayor of Beijing.
   Although some Western economic sanctions imposed after the
crackdown have been lifted, China's relations with the outside
world still are marked by suspicion and xenophobia.
   Premier Li Peng has begun a campaign to teach children about the
1840 Opium War between Britain and China ``so as to heighten their
vigilance against the imperialistic strategy'' of turning China
into a capitalist state.
   China insists its doors to the world remain open, and welcomes
foreign investment, but the people are told not to talk to foreign
journalists. A student's university told him that, if he did not
stop seeing his German girlfriend, he would be sent to a job in the
remote countryside.
   Ying Ruocheng, a well-known actor and who is vice minister of
culture, admitted some in the hierarchy favor a return to isolation
and link politically suspect art to the spread of Western ideas,
but said: ``We do not advocate this.''
   The democracy movement had a bright moment this month when Chai
Ling, a leader of the Tiananmen protests, turned up in France with
her husband after 10 months on the run inside China. Both are
wanted for counterrevolutionary crimes.
   Yan Jiaqi, a dissident political scientist who leads the
Federation for Democracy in China, based in Paris, said tight
political controls make it unlikely any opposition to the
government will be evident this spring.
   Police know the Chinese fondness for anniversaries and will be
especially vigilant April 27, the anniversary of one of the biggest
demonstrations, and May 4, when a historic student movement in 1919
is observed.
   Then comes May 20, the day martial law was declared, and finally
June 3-4, when the army moved in.
   For the many Beijing residents who scorn the government but are
uneasy about social unrest, it's a matter of enduring the
propaganda and the police.
   ``Everyone tries to avoid talking about politics,'' a young
businessman said. ``It can only get you in trouble.''

   The air force on Saturday flew
emergency Easter supplies to two small outback towns cut off by two
weeks of heavy rain in southwest Queensland state, where flood
warnings were posted for seven rivers.
   Overflowing rivers isolated the towns of Quilpie and
Thargomindah, both about 670 miles west of Brisbane, police said.
   For two weeks, all supplies have had to be either flown into the
towns or ferried across the swollen rivers. Police at Quilpie said
the air force had flown 15 tons of food supplies to the town using
Hercules transport planes.
   Both Quilpie, an opal mining town with a population of 700, and
Thargomindah, a small farming community, had more rain Friday
night, keeping the rivers high but not causing any serious flooding
in the towns themselves, police said.
   Flood warnings were posted for the Balonne, Maranoa, Paroo,
Bulloo, Warrego, Thomson and Barcoo Rivers.

   Two more shootings at Greyhound buses were
reported to federal and state authorities today but the
strike-plagued company says no injuries were reported.
   A bullet ricocheted off a San Antonio-bound bus at a Dallas-area
freeway interchange shortly before midnight. Another gunshot struck
a bus traveling from Birmingham, Ala., to Nashville, Tenn., a
Greyhound spokesman said.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. has decried the violence, which includes
more than 30 shooting attacks, saying the company won't negotiate
with striking drivers and other employees until a week goes by
without incident.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions in Washington,
D.C., also has condemned the violence. A representative of the
union did not immediately return telephone calls today from The
Associated Press regarding the latest shootings.
   The Texas bus was carrying no passengers when its driver heard a
noise at the interchange with Interstates 35 and 635 in the Dallas
suburb of DeSoto. He noticed the damage at Troy, between Waco and
Temple, and called the company.
   The bus was sent on to San Antonio, where it was met by police
and an agent of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, said Kevin Fry, a Greyhound spokesman in Dallas.
   The bullet, which struck the bus about 6 feet off the ground
near an American flag painted on its right side, was from a
small-to midcaliber handgun fired from behind the bus,
investigators said.
   ``It ricocheted off the bus, never penetrating the skin,'' Fry
said.
   The second shooting occurred on a Nashville-bound bus with six
passengers aboard. Its driver was at an undetermined location on
Interstate 65 when gunfire hit the eastbound bus about 3:20 a.m.
CDT today.
   ATF and FBI agents were investigating the shooting with state
and local authorities, Fry said. Both federal agencies did not
immediately return calls.
   On Friday, authorities in Maywood, Ill., discovered a Greyhound
bus parked near railroad tracks, its engine still running. It
apparently was abandoned after a failed attempt to park it across
the tracks, officers said.
   Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office and maintenance
workers walked out in March over wages and job security. The
company has been operating a reduced schedule since, using
permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross picket lines.
   Besides the shooting attacks on buses, Greyhound has reported 70
bomb threats and more than 100 other incidents of violence.
   Greyhound's unions have also reported violence directed at them.
A picketing driver, Robert Waterhouse, 59, died when he was crushed
by a bus driven by a replacement driver in Redding, Calif.; the
driver was not charged.

   The sleepy 101st Congress finally is
threatening to pass some bills.
   Usually by now the congressional agenda is clogged with budget
resolutions, spending bills, and bins of social legislation.
   Not this year. The Easter recess was stretched from one week to
two as the congressional leadership took advantage of the paucity
of pressing business.
   When they return this Wednesday, the two chambers still have
little planned. The House has three minor bills scheduled for
action before it adjourns Thursday for another long weekend. The
Senate schedule is less certain but equally light.
   ``This is the easiest Congress I've ever had,'' said one top
Senate staffer who's spent more than two decades on Capitol Hill.
   The Democratic leadership has decided to focus its efforts on a
couple of showpiece bills, child care and clean air.
   The House and Senate have passed competing blueprints for how
the government should subsidize child care, and are working toward
a compromise that can go to President Bush. The last time a
Democratic Congress sent such legislation to a Republican president
was in 1971, and President Nixon vetoed it.
   It's been nearly a decade and a half since the country's clean
air laws were significantly updated, but the Senate now has passed
a bill with bipartisan support. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., has promised action in his chamber by early May _ and then
another House-Senate negotiation will ensue.
   Campaign finance reform is on the agenda in both chambers,
although partisan disagreements may doom enactment. There's talk of
compromise in the Senate, but talks in the House between Foley and
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., have come to naught.
   Most of the remainder of the congressional agenda is bundled up
in budget matters and, so far, it's a bottleneck.
   Halfway through the spending year, Congress and the president
are still tinkering with fiscal 1990 spending.
   Bush asked Congress for an emergency increase of $870 million in
foreign aid spending. Most of that would go toward rebuilding
Panama after the U.S. invasion and to support Nicaragua's new
democratic government.
   The House passed the bill before the Easter recess, but not
before pumping the total up to $2.4 billion with money for food
stamps, forest-fire fighting, veterans programs and other domestic
spending. The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to
consider its version late this week.
   Congress was supposed to have completed the fiscal 1991 budget
by April 15. But budget resolutions still haven't been voted out of
the House or Senate budget committees.
   Members of both panels have been meeting behind closed doors in
recent weeks in attempts to hammer out $1.2 trillion budgets for
the new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   Majority Democrats on each committee are looking for mixtures of
minor tax increases and cuts in defense and domestic spending that
will yield at least $37 billion in savings, the minimum required by
the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. Republicans have been
balking, saying they will stand by the budget President Bush
requested in January.
   Congress faces difficult decisions that will include the depth
and character of cuts to be made in military spending and how to
squeeze billions of dollars worth of domestic initiatives into an
already tight budget. Just like last year, Congress will also have
to decide which taxes can be raised while still allowing President
Bush to claim adherence to his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
   Speaker Foley has said that one thing sure to come out of the
budget process this year is to move the Social Security trust fund
``off-budget.'' Although just a bookkeeping change, this will give
politicians a chance to reassure retired and soon-to-be retired
voters that their checks will keep coming.
   The Democrats continue to blame the slow pace of congressional
activity on last year's traumatic removal of former House Speaker
Jim Wright, who was accused of violating House ethics rules.
   Normally in a two-year Congress, the first year is when the
groundwork is laid for final passage of legislation in the second
year. But ``last year was restoring the civility,'' leaving more of
the groundwork for this year, said Jeff Biggs, Foley's spokesman.

<HEAD>Canton Judge Warns of Arms Proliferation, Nine Executed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canton executed three people last week who were
convicted of committing crimes with guns and a court sentenced
eight others to death in an effort to crack down on illegal
firearms in the southern city.
   Chinese are not allowed to keep guns, with the exception of a
few people who hunt in the countryside, and crimes committed by
armed assailants are still relatively rare in China.
   Deng Guoji, chief of Canton's Intermediate Court, said Thursday
the selling and buying of illegal guns has become rampant in Canton
and that such crimes will be dealt with ``heavily and quickly.''
   The report, carried in Canton's Yancheng Evening News on Friday
and seen in Beijing on Saturday, quoted Deng as saying criminals
were using guns to steal, rape, kill and commit highway robbery.
Such armed criminals were ``swollen with arrogance and malicious in
the extreme,'' he said.
   On Thursday, a Canton court sentenced 16 people for crimes
involving the use of guns. Of those, three were immediately
executed and eight were given the death sentence. The three
condemned people were convicted of armed robbery and rape and the
murder of a policeman who tried to arrest them.
   The report said six other people were executed Thursday,
including a policeman, for robbery and other crimes. But it was not
immediately clear when the six were sentenced or for what crimes.
   The report said that in 1988 and 1989 Canton police broke more
than 30 cases concerning the illegal selling and buying of guns and
ammunition. They confiscated about 100 military-use handguns or
their copies.
   Chinese sentenced to death can appeal to a higher court, but few
are successful. Executions are carried out with a bullet to the
back of the head.

<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old man with no criminal
record has been charged with the murders of six of seven black
women found strangled in Kansas City since September.
   Ray Shawn Jackson, 22, described as a part-time laborer, also
was charged with the assault of another woman Monday night whose
attack was interrupted by a passerby, authorities said.
   Jackson was arrested Thursday afternoon at his grandmother's
house three blocks east of Gillham Park, where four of the six
women were found. He was charged Friday with six counts of
first-degree murder, hours after the funeral of the latest victim,
Michelle Mitchell.
   Police Chief Larry Joiner said that the six victims had all been
lured to areas in or near the park by the promise of obtaining
crack cocaine.
   The investigation has not produced evidence linking Jackson to
the death of a seventh woman, Brenda McCoy, 33, who was found Sept.
26, Joiner said.
   Many blacks have said authorities and the media failed to give
the case adequate attention because the victims were black
prostitutes and drug addicts. Joiner said Jackson, who also is
black, had no history of violence or any prior arrest record, but
it was his understanding he had used drugs.
   ``I don't think I can get into his motives,'' the police chief
said.
   A woman who told the police she had been with Miss Mitchell and
Jackson hours before her body was found helped authorities draw a
composite sketch of the suspect.
   A 27-year-old black woman assaulted on Monday had identified
Jackson from a photograph as her assailant, Joiner said. She said
the assailant was scared away by a man out walking his dog.
   Homicide detectives found Jackson while canvassing a
neighborhood near the park looking for anyone who recognized the
composite drawing. Witnesses pointed police to his grandmother's
home and he was arrested when he came home later in the afternoon.
   In addition to the killing of Miss Mitchell, whose body was
found in the park on April 5, Jackson is charged with killing
Annette Stewart, 33, found dead on Sept. 16; Kimberly Creer, 22,
found Sept. 20; Tresa Williams, 21, found Oct. 22; Janice Berryman,
36, found Oct. 28; and Tonya Ward, 23, found Jan. 18.
   Jackson's bond was set at $700,000. He was being held in the
city jail Friday night, pending an arraignment this morning.

<HEAD>Soviets Step Up Aid to Kabul Government, Envoy Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has stepped up aid
to Afghanistan's government while edging forward in talks for a
political end to the 12-year-old war, a senior U.S. diplomat said
Saturday.
   Moscow spends $500 million a month on arms and aid to its allies
in Kabul, up from a previous high of $300 million, said the
diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The regime is divided and weak and totally dependent on the
Soviet Union, just like us in Vietnam. The Soviet Union is sending
$5 billion a year in military and humanitarian aid to Kabul,'' he
said.
   The Moslem guerrillas, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy
warriors, get $600 million annually in military assistance from the
United States. They also receive aid from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia
and other sympathetic Arab states.
   The Moslem insurgents have been fighting for 12 years to unseat
Afghanistan's Communist-style government and establish an Islamic
republic.
   The Kremlin sent Red Army troops into the Central Asian nation
in 1979 to bolster the Kabul government and to put down the
burgeoning Moslem insurgency.
   The Soviet Union pulled out its troops in February 1989, but the
U.S. diplomat said 500 Soviet military intelligence officers were
operating in the Afghan capital, up from 300 last year.
   Moscow beefed up its weapons and food supplies to Kabul in
December after President Najib uncovered a coup plot, the diplomat
said.
   But less then three months later, Najib's renegade defense
minister, Shah Nawaz Tanai, launched the bloodiest and most serious
challenge yet.
   Western diplomats said the March 6 coup weakened Najib, and the
diplomat predicted it would push Moscow toward a more flexible
bargaining position.
   ``We're making progress with the Soviets. There is movement
(and) there will be more in the months ahead,'' he said, referring
to next month's summit meeting between President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   So far, Moscow has refused to open talks on what Washington
insists is the key to a settlement _ the removal of Najib.
   ``Soviets are still insisting on Najib,'' the diplomat said.
   ``The key is the transfer of power, of police, intelligence, and
military to some neutral body. There won't be a political solution
as long as Najib and his cohorts are there.''

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces battled with tank
cannon, mortars and machine guns in east Beirut Saturday as France
was reported to be trying to persuade Gen. Michel Aoun to step down.
   At least seven people were wounded in a one-hour battle along
the edges of the hilltop residential district of Ashrafiyeh, a
stronghold of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   Aoun's 19,000 troops and Geagea's militia have fought each other
to a standstill since Jan. 30, killing 875 people and wounding
2,376 in a battle for dominance of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave.
   The inconclusive showdown has inflicted property damage
estimated at $1 billion and forced about 400,000 of the enclave's 1
million people to flee to safer areas in Lebanon and neighboring
states.
   The two sides blamed each other for Saturday morning's flareup,
which coincided with talks in Lebanon by Arab League envoy Lakhdar
Ibrahimi in an effort to salvage a peace pact reached more than
five months ago.
   The accord aimed at ending the 15-year-old civil war was worked
out by Lebanese legislators at the Saudi resort of Taif last
October.
   Aoun has rejected the Taif accord and the election of
Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi a month later. He has
criticized the accord for failing to provide a timetable for the
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon.
   ``The Taif accord has stumbled in the first steps, but there is
a real chance to put it on the proper track once again,'' Ibrahimi
told reporters after a one-hour meeting with Maronite Catholic
Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronites, the largest Christian
sect, which has dominated Lebanon's politics since independence
from France in 1943.
   The prestigious newspaper An-Nahar said that France, traditional
patron of Lebanon's Christians, has launched an effort to persuade
Aoun to resign in favor of Hrawi.
   The report, which quoted unidentified informed sources, said
French Ambassador Rene Ala held a three-hour meeting with Aoun
Friday in which he relayed the French advice.
   The French effort, the newspaper said, was ``coordinated'' with
Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria, whose leaders brokered the Taif
accord.
   A duty officer at the French Foreign Ministry in Paris said
there was no one available to comment on the newspaper report.

<HEAD>Publicity War in Greyhound Strike Marks Trend in Labor Disputes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hours after a sniper opened fire on a
Greyhound bus in Florida last month, company chairman Fred Currey
was on the scene, boarding a bus to ride under the very overpass
where the gunman had hidden.
   Currey's visit was part of what a company spokesman termed a
``Florida blitz'' designed to gain Greyhound favorable statewide
news coverage in the early days of the strike by its drivers' union.
   ``Every news person in northern Florida was there,'' said
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley, whose company dispatched Currey
to three Florida cities that day to meet publicly with riders and
replacement drivers.
   Greyhound's public relations gambit was just one battle in the
war to court public favor in the six-week-old drivers' strike, but
analysts say it reflects a growing trend toward sophisticated
publicity contests in labor-management disputes.
   ``A public relation agent is a participant now either at the
bargaining table or right outside the room,'' said Don Blohowiak, a
New York media analyst who studies business-media relations.
   ``The court of public opinion is very important to success in
the marketplace. In something like a labor dispute, our impressions
stay with us for a very long time,'' Blohowiak said.
   He said most consumers ``want to do business with companies we
like or feel good about, companies we think conduct business with
their employees in a reasonable and ethical way.''
   Greyhound is not alone in seeking public favor in the strike.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, without an
in-house public relations department, hired a Washington company
six days before the strike to dramatize the economic issues, such
as the decline in drivers' average pay from $31,000 to $21,000
since 1983.
   Still, some labor leaders complain privately that the union
hasn't been as aggressive as Greyhound in seeking to mold public
opinion.
   ``The union hasn't awakened to the fact that it needs to sell
its message to win,'' said one labor analyst, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   But the union's public relations agent, Nick Nichols, said
striking drivers can't compete with the company's money.
   ``Clearly, it's a David and Goliath thing. The Greyhound drivers
simply don't have the resources,'' Nichols said.
   Neither side in the bus strike will say what it's spending for
public relations advice. Since March 2, when 6,300 drivers and
3,000 maintenance and other workers walked out, the strike has been
marred by vandalism and violence. The company has refused to return
to the bargaining table until a week goes by without a violent
incident.
   Analysts point to the ongoing Eastern Air Lines walkout and last
year's Pittston coal strike as recent labor disputes where unions
waged successful campaigns to win public support.
   Although machinists at Eastern are still on strike, their
publicity campaign against Frank Lorenzo, head of the carrier's
parent company, ``made him out to be the Darth Vader'' of the
corporate world in the public's mind, one labor official said.
   Blohowiak said companies are more media-conscious now than they
were 10 years ago because increased competition has prompted
consumers to consider a company's attitude toward its workers when
making purchasing decisions.
   ``After seeing the drubbing that Exxon took over one accident,
or a Frank Lorenzo took, you can't hide and pretend you don't have
problems, that no one's interested,'' he said.
   Greyhound's efforts to win public opinion have been persistent.
   Twice in two weeks, Dallas-based Greyhound executives flew to
Washington for news conferences to complain about strike-related
violence. Neither event had a Washington focus, and in fact, the
latest one was to announce the filing of a lawsuit in Florida
against union officials.
   Gravley, the Greyhound spokesman, said the event was held in
Washington because that's where the national press corps is based.
   ``If you want to be heard nationally, you have to go where the
national media is,'' said media analyst Don Kellermann.
   Greyhound used a well-known New York public relations firm,
Ruder Finn, for advice and help in setting up the Washington news
conferences. It also has taken out several full-page newspaper ads
on the strike.
   Labor officials contend the company's Washington announcements
are part of a strategy to distort public perception of the strike.
   ``It's a great tack for diverting attention from what the real
issues are,'' said Denise Mitchell, a Washington public relations
agent who helped Pittston miners win widespread community support
during last year's coal strike.
   Sophisticated publicity efforts by management have forced unions
to try to keep up, she said.
   ``We increasingly counsel people that they have to get out front
in the contest to win public support,'' Mitchell said. ``Being
prepared at the bargaining table, doing your homework on the
economic issues, just isn't enough anymore.''

   President Bush is telling Soviet

said as he prepared to tee off for golf. ``I haven't seen the
intelligence yet. I will when I get in.''
   He told reporters that he wanted to get a clarification Friday
night, but it was ``midnight over there, early morning.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the administration
was taking a ``wait and see'' attitude as it weighed its options in
the event of a Soviet economic crackdown.
   ``It's not entirely easy to know what the next moves are going
to be,'' Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network. He said
the sanctions ``would have an adverse impact'' on U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   He would not speculate on what the United States response would
be to sanctions.
   Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, meeting Friday on
this Atlantic resort island, had issued a joint plea to Gorbachev
to settle the Baltic dispute through negotiation rather than
coercion.
   Asked about his daylong meeting with the prime minister, Bush
said today, ``It's very important to stay on the same wavelength
with Mrs. Thatcher. There are slight nuances on one or two things
but we're very close together.'' He refused to elaborate.
   High winds and a steady rain did not deter Bush from a morning
golf game with top aides as well as Thatcher's husband, Denis.
   Asked why he was playing in such weather, Bush said, ``We wanted
the press to walk around and get into shape.''
   He said golf ``refurbishes the spirit ... you've got to have a
mix of work and recreation.'' The weather cleared by mid-morning
and when Bush completed his tour of the course at the Mid Ocean
Golf Club he was plainly pleased. ``It was just heaven,'' he said
of his game.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported Friday that Gorbachev had
given Lithuania 24 hours to end its ``anticonstitutional
acitivities.'' The issue dominated the joint news conference
between Bush and Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``Now is no time for escalation,'' Bush said Friday at a joint
news conference with Mrs. Thatcher.
   He said the United States has made it clear to Gorbachev both
publicly and privately that ``coercion, escalation is not the way
to go. The way to go is dialogue.'' And he called on the Soviet
leader to heed his words.
   Similarly, Mrs. Thatcher said the confrontation ``must be solved
by discussion.''
   The president was notified about Gorbachev's ultimatum toward
the end of his daylong meeting with Mrs. Thatcher.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later that the
United States was still trying to sort out ``what had happened and
what it means.''
   Mrs. Thatcher invited Bush to this British colony as a prelude
to his Washington summit with Gorbachev late next month. The
president met Tuesday with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
in Toronto and will confer with French President Francois
Mitterrand in Key Largo, Fla., next week.
   Friday's talks centered on the prospects of a unified Germany,
the future of the NATO alliance and the unrest in the Soviet Union.
Both leaders reported a broad measure of agreement on the issues
before them.
   They took time off from their four hours of talks to watch 20
children fly colorful, handmade kites in a traditional Good Friday
celebration. They also planted palm trees in a grove where two of
their predecessors had done the same.
   The two leaders and their top aides later mingled at a black-tie
reception aboard a British warship, HMS Arrow, and at a dinner.
   Asked if he would telephone Gorbachev with his concerns about
Lithuania, Bush said: ``I might and I might not. But certainly it's
time to stay in close contact, and we have many ways of doing
that.''
   He noted that 24 hours earlier the tone coming from the Soviet
Union was quite different.
   Bush welcomed as a ``positive statement'' Gorbachev's remark to
a delegation of U.S. senators that an arms control agreement might
be ready in time for their five-day summit, beginning May 30. He
said that was a ``different slant'' than the one that emerged from
his meeting last week with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   Bush said he and Mrs. Thatcher agreed that a unified Germany
must remain a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, including its military structures. He said this was
in the ``genuine security interest of all European states.''
   Among the Western allies, Mrs. Thatcher has been portrayed as
the one most reluctant to see German unification and favoring a
go-slow approach.
   The prime minister said she and Bush agreed that NATO will
continue to need a mix of conventional and nuclear forces and that
they must be kept up to date. ``Whether we can make further
reductions in the overall number of NATO warheads in Europe is
something which will need to be considered as a whole,'' she said.
   On other issues:
   _Bush said he would cooperate with any attempts to totally ban
the shipment of weapons to terrorist nations. Mrs. Thatcher said
British experts were still trying to determine wether a piece of
steel piping confiscated before shipment to Iraq was part of an
artillery cannon.
   _Both leaders reiterated their commitment to bring to justice
the terrorists who bombed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in December 1988. All 259 people on the plane and 11 on
the ground were killed.
   Their statement came in response to a plea from relatives of two
victims that the leaders reaffirm their commitment to combat
terrorism.
   Earlier, Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One that he is
personally inclined to grant East Germany's request for forgiveness
over its rol in the Nazi Holocaust that killed millions of Jews and
others.
   ``I'm a Christian,'' he said, ``and I think that forgiveness is
something that I feel very strongly about.''
   But he added that the world should not forget the Holocaust.
``You learn from history, what not to do wrong, how to conduct
oneself,'' he said.

   Top Army officials, pressured to meet demands
for sharp reductions in Pentagon spending, have agreed to a
proposal that would cut about one soldier in four from the service
by 1997, senior Pentagon sources say.
   Army Secretary Michael Stone and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Carl
Vuono gave their final approval to the proposal on Wednesday, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name.
   Under the proposal, active duty forces would plummet from the
current 764,000 to 580,000 by the beginning of fiscal year 1997.
   The number of National Guard and Reserve forces would be slashed
as well, although not as precipitously, dropping from the present
776,000 to 645,000 slots over the same time period, the sources
said.
   Even though the move cuts tens of thousands of soldiers from
Army rolls _ beyond what the service projected it would do in the
last Pentagon budget _ the proposal may not placate demands on
Capitol Hill for even more severe layoffs.
   In hot pursuit of a so-called peace dividend amid lessened
superpower tension, some lawmakers have called for cutbacks or even
outright cancellation of high-cost weapons programs, such as the
$530 million B-2 stealth bomber. But savings can't be gleaned as
quickly from long-term weapons programs as they can from personnel
accounts because weaponry costs are stretched over a period of many
years.
   So that leaves the manpower-intensive Army, with the largest
segment of the nation's 2.1 million-member military force, as the
biggest target for possible budget savings.
   ``It's painful,'' said one senior Pentagon planner who is
knowledgeable about the Army's proposal. ``It took some
gut-wrenching decisions. But at least we have a plan.''
   Another source, who also spoke privately, said the proposal was
forced upon the service by ``fiscal reality,'' even as he expressed
concerns about pressures to go beyond the 580,000 level.
   ``That would bring us pretty close to a dysfunctional Army,'' he
said, given the national security requirement for a ``trained and
ready'' force.
   The senior official did not say how much savings were being
projected from the manpower cut. It is difficult to project
near-term savings from force reductions because of the possibility
that severance pay may be allocated to more senior servicemen and
women.
   The new proposal is contained in the Army's long-term budget
proposal formally known in Pentagon jargon as the ``POM,'' or
program objective memorandum. It contains the service's spending
desires through the years 1992 to 1997, in line with top-line
budget numbers handed down by the civilian Pentagon leadership.
   The Washington Post reported in Saturday's editions that a
``fiscal guidance'' memorandum issued by Deputy Defense Secretary
Donald J. Atwood to military and civilian leaders in February calls
for the Army budget to increase slightly from $74.6 billion in
fiscal 1992 to $76.5 billion in fiscal 1997 _ a level that would
not keep pace with the expected rate of inflation.
   In the fiscal 1991 budget Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sent to
Capitol Hill in January, he sought $295.1 billion in spending
authority. But given the recent changes that have swept Eastern
Europe and prospects of arms control agreements with the Soviet
Union, lawmakers have called Cheney's proposals bloated and
outdated.
   At a recent hearing before the House Armed Services Committee,
Vuono warned that making precipitous cuts in personnel would lead
to serious morale and readiness problems.
   The general, asked about a proposal to take 65,000 soldiers from
the force in 1991 alone, said such a cut would result in ``a
devastating act on the Army.''
   While Vuono has widely acknowledged that the Army will be
smaller in the future, he has argued for planned reductions over a
period of years in order to avoid leaving gaps in certain ranks of
experienced personnel, which would harm the Army's ability to fight
when called upon.
   ``In my view, more rapid reductions threaten to fracture the
Army,'' Vuono said.
   That didn't satisfy Armed Services chairman Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., who warned that some proposed cuts of 35,000 a year didn't
nearly go far enough.
   ``People are thinking we are going to get a very significant
contribution from defense for the deficit reduction,'' Aspin said.
``It is not going to be demobilization, but it certainly is more
accelerated than the type of gradual thing you are looking at.''
   Vuono replied that the nation's military leaders are well aware
of the pressures, but he hoped the nation and Congress are
``prepared for the consequences.''

<HEAD>Firms Offer Non-Legal Services, Raising Professional Concerns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The growing number of law firms that offer
investment advice, public relations help and other services has
prompted the nation's largest lawyer group to consider restrictions.
   The issue has become even more urgent since the previously
unthinkable is about to happen: non-lawyers will wield much the
same clout within some law firms as lawyers.
   ``It's a pretty explosive issue,'' said Dick Collins, an
American Bar Association spokesman. ``To the oldtime definition of
professionalism, this is anathema. Nevertheless, this sort of thing
is out there and we will have to deal with it.''
   The ABA's policy-making House of Delegates will be presented at
its convention in August with recommendations to limit lawyers
providing non-legal services and to ban non-lawyers from becoming
law firm partners.
   If adopted as official ABA policy, the recommendations will
serve as models for legal ethics rules enforced by each state.
   Law firms, and the rules that govern them, may be headed in the
opposite direction, however.
   In the District of Columbia, where law firm diversification got
its first foothold, local rules underwent a revolutionary,
first-in-the-nation revision last month to allow non-lawyers to
become partners.
   The changes, which take effect in January, are an attempt to
help law firms ``attract and retain skills not traditionally found
among lawyers,'' said Robert E. Jordan III, a prime backer of the
new rules.
   Jordan's prestigious law firm of Steptoe &amp; Johnson, along with
several others in the nation's capital, have for years provided
investment advice, lobbying and international trade consulting
through subsidiaries run by non-lawyers.
   Nationwide, about 80 law firms are affiliated with businesses
that provide non-legal services.
   ``From a status standpoint, these executive-director types have
been second-class citizens even though they can be making more
money than some of the law firm's partners,'' Jordan said. ``The
rule change, though quite severely restrained, may make it easier
to hold on to such people.''
   Lawyers should not reject all outside, or even in-house,
consulting by non-lawyers, he says.
   For years, consulting businesses that specialize in jury
selection have helped lawyers pick juries for certain kinds of
cases, Jordan noted, adding that some day these businesses may be
brought into the law firms.
   ``Consulting is not adverse to a legal client,'' he said. ``Some
law firms have hired English professors for clear-writing programs.
I think any thoughtful lawyer realizes that anything you can do to
make your case more persuasive, you should do it _ even if that
means hiring a non-lawyer to help.''
   But the concepts of diversification and non-lawyer partners have
their outspoken critics.
   ``This whole idea of one-stop shopping is highly dangerous,''
said L. Harold Levinson, a legal ethics professor at the Vanderbilt
University law school in Nashville.
   ``Inevitably, these non-lawyers will exert some influence on
culture of the law firm, and on the culture of the legal
profession,'' Levinson said. ``There is a need to improve, but we
should improve ourselves rather than sharing with others the
responsibility to improve.''
   One potential ethical problem, he said, stems from the common
law privilege lawyers enjoy against testifying against their
clients. Would the same privilege exist for non-lawyers?
   Levinson also said the seemingly tempting economics of letting
non-lawyers play larger roles in law firms may backfire.
   ``Lawyers untrained in the specialized services offered by the
non-lawyer partner will have no way of knowing whether the
non-lawyer partner is rendering high-quality service or not,'' he
said.
   However real the potential pitfalls, a number of District of
Columbia law firms appear ready _ even eager _ to take let
non-lawyers in as partners.

<HEAD>Landsbergis Pursues Strategy of Peaceful Resistance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man leading Lithuania's peaceful drive to win
its independence from the Soviet Union is a soft-spoken,
57-year-old music professor.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis lacks the charisma of
Poland's Lech Walesa or Czechoslovakia's Vaclav Havel. His efforts
are more likely to evoke comparisons to Mohandas K. Gandhi's
strategy of unarmed resistance.
   Yet in just two years, Landsbergis and other leaders of the
Sajudis people's front have organized the staid Lithuanians into an
unswerving mass determined to be free of the Soviet Union.
   Some call him unflinching. Others say he is obstinate, risking
revival of the superpowers' Cold War for the sake of his small
nation that declared independence a month ago.
   Gandhi won India's independence by trading on the British sense
of fair play. Landsbergis is gambling that Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev has rejected the ruthless violence of his
predecessors. He hopes Gorbachev will admit that Lithuania was
unjustly, forcibly annexed into the Soviet Union in 1940 and that
this wrong should be righted.
   He says that only by letting Lithuania go will Gorbachev succeed
in forging a Soviet Union held together by its inhabitants' will
instead of the army's force.
   But there are indications that Gorbachev is focusing his anger
at Lithuania on Landsbergis, and wants him removed before he will
sit down and talk.
   ``The president of the U.S.S.R. does not intend to sit at a
table of negotiations with Landsbergis,'' Leonid Mikhailov said in
the journal New Times, a Soviet political magazine.
   There is no guarantee that the ouster of Landsbergis alone will
be enough to bring Gorbachev to compromise, not when he insists
that Lithuanian success would spark more separatism across the
Soviet Union, leading to bloody ethnic violence.
   Mikhailov's analysis of the tense standoff was remarkably
even-handed compared with the anti-Lithuanian articles filling the
Soviet press in the past month. He concluded that the Soviet
campaign of intimidating military maneuvers, occupation of key
buildings by soldiers, and attempts to block implementation of
Lithuanian laws is designed to destroy the credibility of the
Landsbergis government in the eyes of Lithuanians.
   ``Every day, proof of the impossibility of fulfilling their
promises brings Landsbergis closer to defeat,'' Mikhailov wrote.
   So far, however, that is not happening.
   Instead, the Lithuanian people are standing by Landsbergis and
the government that declared independence March 11.
   When Moscow installed its own chief prosecutor, the staff
ignored him and continued to work for the Lithuanian-appointed
prosecutor.
   When the Communists loyal to Moscow sent 15 soldiers into the
republic's only newspaper printing plant and demanded that only
their newspaper be published, the 1,000-strong staff of printers
ignored them, and continued to produce independence-oriented news.
   But Landsbergis had to suspend plans for a Lithuanian border
guard for fear that the force would run into violent resistance
from Soviet KGB border troops.
   And despite a month of such psychological war, with tank tracks
carving up the well-kept streets of Vilnius, Landsbergis has
remained calm. And he has kept his people quiet, too.
   Moscow has reported only a handful of incidents of minor
violence, which are being investigated. Independent confirmation
has been more difficult since Moscow expelled foreigners from the
republic.
   When Gorbachev demanded Lithuanians surrender their 30,000
hunting guns, and Landsbergis refused to honor the order of a
``foreign government,'' only 1,500 were volunteered to local police.
   When threatened with the prospect of Soviet soldiers breaking
into homes to confiscate hunting guns, Landsbergis stuck to his
Gandhi-style strategy of peaceful resistance.
   ``Those uninvited guests should be treated as guests,'' he
advised citizens. ``People should be polite and should explain to
the intruders about their actions.''
   Landsbergis is following his forefathers' footsteps as a freedom
fighter. His grandfather was imprisoned and deported for
nationalism, and his father fought in the underground against the
Nazis.
   Yet he had never played a role in politics until taking the lead
at the Sajudis pro-democracy, pro-independence movement at its
first congress 18 months ago.
   Sajudis, whose members come from a variety of political parties,
swept to power in the first free parliamentary elections in 50
years in the Ireland-sized Baltic republic in February and March.
   Landsbergis refuses to hold a referendum on independence.
Lithuanians could vote on joining the Soviet Union, but not leaving
it, he says, because they were not legally annexed.
   Landsbergis is furious at the West, particularly the United
States and 27 other countries that said Lithuania was not part of
the Soviet Union for 50 years, then failed to give formal
recognition of independence when the crisis came.
   ``Are they willing to sell Lithuania again to the Soviet
Union?'' he asked in a deadly calm voice, in clear reference to the
events of World War II, when the West concentrated on Nazi Germany
and ignored the Soviet occupation and annexation of the Baltics.
   Repeatedly, Landsbergis telegrams Gorbachev asking for dialogue,
holding out wide possibilities for compromise on specifics from
allowing Soviet military bases to remain on Lithuanian territory to
gradual transfer of trade to world prices.
   ``There are no questions that cannot be discussed, except
independence,'' Landsbergis said.
   But Gorbachev has not budged from his insistence that
independence must be canceled before he will negotiate.
   ``It's difficult to establish contact with a brick wall,''
Landsbergis sighs.

   A court on Saturday approved the formation
of three more political parties, bringing to eight the number of
opposition parties in Egypt.
   The Supreme Administrative Court rejected the application
request of a fourth political party. The rulings by Judge Anwar
Mahfouz are final and ended a 4-year-old legal battle.
   The three newly approved parties are named Young Egypt, The
Greens and The Unionist Democratic Party. Their programs were not
immediately known but Mahfouz said their policies were ``compatible
with the policy of the state.''
   The rejected party, The Nasserite Party, which follows the
socialist policies of late President Gmal Abdel Nasser, was
rejected because it was ``retrogressive,'' Mahfouz said.
   President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party has a
majority in Parliament. The five other opposition parties are the
rightist Wafd party; the Moslem fundamentalist Umma party; the
socialist Labor party; the rightist Liberal party and the
pro-Moscow National Unionist Progressive Party.

<HEAD>Thousands of Protesters from Both Germanys Join Easter Marches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace activists from both Germanys protested
together for the first time during traditional Easter marches
Saturday, while guards waved tens of thousands of cars through the
border to prevent traffic jams.
   The custom of Easter marches for peace dates back to the 1950s,
but protests were held separately in East and West Germany for
decades until the border opened during East Germany's revolution
last fall.
   East Germans were among nearly 1,000 marchers who began a
three-day march in the West German city of Duisburg under the
slogan ``to live without armaments.'' The demonstrators plan to
march from town to town through the industrialized Ruhr region.
   More than 1,000 protesters set out from the East German Baltic
port of Rostock for the West German port of Luebeck, demanding that
a unified Germany contribute to making peace more secure in Europe.
   Some 5,000 residents of the East German districts of Rathenow
and Havelberg, about 37 miles west of Berlin, marched to a military
training field near the Elbe river demanding that trees be planted
and the land recultivated.
   Similar marches and rallies took place in about a dozen cities
and towns throughout the two Germanys, but most of the Easter
marches were scheduled for Sunday.
   Tens of thousands of Germans from East and West poured through
the border for the second day in a row for Easter weekend holiday
trips with family and friends.
   A decision by newly elected Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere to
ease passport checks appeared to speed up the process of crossing
the border.
   ``We only waited five minutes on the border. At Christmas it was
awful, and now it goes so smoothly,'' said political scientist
Roland Freudentstein, who drove by car to West Berlin from his home
in Cologne.
   The Central Traffic Information Service in the West German city
of Duesseldorf reported that traffic was ``relaxed and calm.'' West
German highways are routinely the site of major traffic jams during
holidays.
   Last-minute shoppers and thousands of visitors strolled through
dozens of crossings leading into both sides of Berlin as uniformed
guards simply raised their arms to wave by the crowds.
   While the holidays pushed politics briefly to the back burner,
debate continued over the exchange rate of the two nations'
currency union.
   Wolf von Amerongen, head of the East Europe Committee of German
Entepreneurs, told a West German radio station he supported the
West German Central bank's position opposing a one-to-one exchange
of East German marks into West German marks.
   East Germany's new Finance Minister, Walter Romberg, said Friday
the East Germans need a one-to-one exchange.
   The West German Central Bank favors a two-to-one exchange rate
for all but small savings accounts, saying that parity would be
inflationary and harmful to economic reconstruction.
   Talks on the currency union are likely to begin shortly after
the Easter holiday.
   In another development, East Germany's former defense minister
said Saturday that the military in both Germanys should set the
pace in disarmament to build trust and erase fears in Europe, a
major newspaper reported.
   Theodor Hoffmann proposed that the military of both Germanys be
brought closer together in the unification process, ``building a
cooperative security structure'' to develop more trust between
Eastern and Western Europe.
   ``Both German armies should set the pace to ease tensions with
drastic disarmament'' as a part of bringing Europeans closer
together, Neues Deutschland quoted Hoffmann as saying. ``This would
contribute to the peoples of Europe having no grounds to fear
German military might.''

   Betty Ann Kirk wanted everyone to know
about her new baby. She called the restaurant where her husband
works. She passed out photographs of herself and the infant girl to
members of her clown club.
   Police were sending out their own pictures, a composite sketch
of the woman they believed shot a 33-year-old mother in the back of
the head and fled with her newborn daughter.
   This week, state prosecutors are expected to seek a first-degree
murder and kidnapping indictment against Ms. Kirk _ known as
``Sweetheart'' the clown _ who concealed her latest miscarriage for
months and may have combed birth announcements looking for a baby
to snatch.
   ``In my right mind, I would have never expected anything like
this,'' said Ms. Kirk's husband, Craig, who has not been charged.
``I feel like it's the crime of the century.''
   Ms. Kirk, 31, who has two children at home, is just the latest
of dozens of women who suffered miscarriages then were arrested on
charges of kidnapping a baby.
   A bloodhound was used in February to track down a New York City
woman who police say was depressed over a miscarriage and took a
3-day-old boy from a hospital maternity ward. In May 1988, a
Maryland jury convicted a woman of smuggling a 3-week-old boy from
a hospital in a canvas bag. She kept the baby four months.
   ``The facts of this case do not surprise me,'' said Dr. Lester
Grinspoon, editor of Harvard's Mental Health Newsletter in
Cambridge, Mass. ``We know that after losing a fetus, some women
experience severe symptoms ranging from depression to delusions.''
   Ms. Kirk lives in North Fort Myers, a 20-mile drive from Sharon
Lynn Parker's ranch-style home on a dead-end street in Lehigh Acres.
   Ms. Parker gave birth to the 7-pound girl March 19 and took out
an announcement in local newspapers. Several months earlier, she
and Ms. Kirk first met at a shopping mall where Ms. Kirk appeared
as a clown and painted circus faces on Ms. Parker's 5-year-old
twins. Both women were pregnant at the time.
   A neighbor walking her dog March 29 noticed a dark-haired woman
pull into the Parkers' driveway and knock on the front door shortly
before 10 a.m., according to a police affidavit. The neighbor kept
walking.
   About six hours later, Ms. Parker's three older children
returned home from school and found their mother's body slumped
into a reclining chair. Their infant sister, Julie Lynn, was
missing but her bottles and baby clothes were left behind.
   Soon, Lee County sheriff deputies were receiving reports from
people who were suspicious of the sudden appearance of Ms. Kirk's
baby, even though for months she had boasted of her pregnancy. Ms.
Kirk even shaved the baby's dark hair to affect the look of a
newborn.
   The day after the slaying, police questioned Ms. Kirk, who
insisted she had given birth at a Fort Myers clinic and went home
several hours later. Her husband appeared bewildered by the
suddenness of the delivery, but said he believed his wife's story
and thought the baby was his, according to police reports.
   The clinic had no record of a baby girl being born that day,
police said.
   Later that night, Ms. Kirk was stopped driving away from her
home, a worn trailer. Her husband asleep, Ms. Kirk had sneaked out,
leaving behind the baby and a note to her husband.
   ``I left you some signed checks,'' it read in part. ``I'm
leaving you because I love you too much.''
   Less than 48 hours after the shooting the baby girl was returned
to her father, Gary, who wept at a news conference.
   ``We're just happy to have her back,'' he said.
   ``It was a well-thought-out, well-calculated murder and
kidnapping,'' said Lee County Sheriff John McDougall.
   In addition to first-degree murder, Ms. Kirk was charged with
kidnapping and a felony weapons count. She could receive the death
penalty if convicted.
   Ms. Kirk's husband believes frustration was building over their
inability to have children since their 1983 marriage.
   He said his wife had four miscarriages including the one in
December. But this time, she retained a large belly and told no one
she lost the fetus, including him, he said.
   ``She was knitting booties and sweaters and hats and all kinds
of stuff,'' said Kirk.
   Ms. Kirk had two children from a former marriage who lived with
the Kirks. She had a third child taken away by state welfare
workers and given up for adoption after her first husband was
convicted of aggravated child abuse.
   Ms. Kirk had helped her daughter sell Girl Scout cookies and
once crafted a hand-made Halloween costume for a neighbor's girl.
   ``She always wanted to be around children,'' said Kirk.

<HEAD>Police Report Six Deaths From Toxic Heroin In Marseille</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heroin contaminated with a toxic
substance killed six young drug addicts and paralyzed four others,
police said Saturday.
   Newspapers suggested the poison might be strychnine, because 3.5
ounces of the deadly substance was stolen from a Marseille pharmacy
on March 30.
   Police said laboratory tests remain inconclusive and have been
unable to determine whether the heroin was intentionally laced with
the poison.
   The men and women killed so far were all in their 20s and all
had purchased the heroin compound from the same source, police said.
   Four others who injected the poisoned substance were saved
through use of an antidote, but their limbs are paralyzed, police
said.

<HEAD>Cape Verde Schedules First Multiparty Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cape Verde will hold its first direct
presidential election and its first multiparty legislative
balloting later this year, political leaders in the west African
nation said.
   The announcement came late Friday at the end of a four-day
meeting by leaders of the only political party now allowed in the
10-island archipelago, the ruling the African Party for the
Indpendence of Cape Verde.
   Olivio Pires, a party spokesman, told the Portuguese news
agency, Lusa, that the presidential election will be held on a
non-party basis this year on a date to be announced later.
   Pires said President Aristides Pereira, who has ruled Cape Verde
since it gained independence from Portugal in 1975, will have to
step down from his post as the party's general secretary if he
chooses to run for re-election.
   Pires said the legislative election will be held in December
after the presidential balloting, Lusa reported from the Cape
Verdian capital, Praia.
   Currently, citizens elect members of the Peoples National
Assembly from lists of candidates put forward by the ruling party.
   The president is then elected by the assembly, the only
legislative body.
   The new political structure was developed with the help of
attorneys in Portugal and is modeled after the election plan in
Portugal, which also chooses its president on a non-party basis.
   The reforms further advance Cape Verde's evolution from the
single-party, Marxist-inspired system it embraced after
independence to a democratic system.
   The country has gradually opened up its economy to private
enterprise and recently introduced legislation that would result in
greater freedom for the press. Some criticism of the ruling party
is already allowed.
   Pereira also has won praise from Western governments, human
rights groups and aid agencies for his pragmatism and tolerance of
political dissent.
   Cape Verde, 385 miles off the Senegalese coast, is the second of
Portugal's former African colonies to implement democratic reforms.
   Sao Tome e Principe announced last year that competition among
political parties will be allowed in upcoming general elections.

<HEAD>Poll: Few East Germans See Kohl as Leader of Unified Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hoping to
be the first leader of a unified Germany, is far less popular in
the East than his top opponent in West Germany's upcoming election,
a poll indicates.
   The Bild am Sonntag newspaper said Oskar LaFontaine, the
left-leaning Social Democratic candidate chosen to run against Kohl
in December, far outstripped the chancellor in a recent poll of
1,000 East German voters.
   LaFontaine, the outspoken governor of West Germany's southern
Saarland state, was favored by 46 percent for chancellor of a
unified Germany, the newspaper said. It said Kohl was chosen by
only 24 percent of a cross-section of voters from East Germany's
major parties that formed the country's newly elected coalition
government on Thursday.
   The report, which was furnished early to other news media and
will appear in the newspaper's Sunday editions, said 30 percent of
those polled were undecided. It gave no margin for error.
   The poll comes just four weeks after East Germany's first free
elections on March 18. A conservative alliance headed by East
Germany's new prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, strongly backed
by Kohl and promises of speedy monetary and economic union, easily
won with 48 percent of the vote.
   Observers at the time said that Kohl's frequent trips into East
Germany to campaign for the conservatives was a major factor in the
election results.
   LaFontaine, who easily won re-election as Saarland state
governor in January with more than 54 percent of the vote, has been
openly critical of Kohl's hurry to unify the two countries.
   Kohl favors quick monetary union and massive financial backing
to restart East Germany's stuttering economy. LaFontaine wants a
slower pace of unification to guarantee social benefits and jobs
for the East Germans.

   Questions haunt the relatives of 47 sailors
killed last April in the fiery blast aboard the USS Iowa and
although the World War II-era warship may retire, the families'
nightmares may not end.
   ``With most accidents, you have the accident and then it's over.
With all the press and the problems related to the investigation,
this just doesn't go away,'' said Dale Schelin, whose son,
Geoffrey, was one of those killed.
   On April 19, 1989, seconds before the Iowa was to fire test
shots from its three-gun No. 2 turret, an explosion in the center
gun killed all 47 men in the upper turret. Thirteen sailors in the
turret's bottom compartment escaped.
   The Navy, which plans to mothball the battleship, concluded the
most likely cause of the blast was sabotage by gunner's mate
Clayton Hartwig, who died in the blast. The Navy said Hartwig was
suicidally despondent over a broken friendship with another sailor.
   The families, however, doubt the Navy's conclusion. They want to
know more about the age of gunpowder that ignited in the blast off
Puerto Rico and about possible malfunctions within the huge gun
turret.
   ``The gunpowder in the turret was stored in the summer of 1988
on barges for 60 days when the temperature exceeded 100 degrees,''
said Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina. ``It is supposed to be
stored at 70 degrees. The high temperatures cause it to
destabilize.''
   Autopsy reports indicate the dead sailors were wearing jewelry
and watches in the turret that could have caused a spark, Ms.
Kubicina said.
   ``I have evidence that indicates the gunpowder was starting to
turn green,'' Ms. Kubicina said. ``When it turns green, that means
it is starting to destabilize. ... In my brother's autopsy and
other ones, it says there were green foreign materials in their
bodies.''
   Ms. Kubicina said she has asked the Navy for a chemical analysis
of the propellants removed from the bodies, ``but but I've been
told no chemical analysis was don.,''
   Sharon Ziegler's husband, Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald Owen
Ziegler, 39, was the senior enlisted man in the Iowa turret. He was
killed less than four months before he was to retire.
   ``It's so hard to believe that men working side-by-side with
each other, depending on each other, that the Navy would pinpoint
one man,'' she said. ``If they had picked on my husband, I would
have fought them just like the Hartwig family.
   ``My husband always said there were many things that could go
wrong. He always said it all depended on his kids pushing the right
buttons. Their lives depended on that.''
   Tests by Navy experts found residue in the center gun of
material the Navy concluded was a detonating device. Those findings
were not duplicated by FBI experts.
   The Navy's report also was criticized by members of Congress and
outside experts, who argue the Navy was looking for a scapegoat and
ignored other possible causes.
   A subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee said the
Navy's conclusion were not supported by the facts.
   Krieg Brusnahan, a lawyer for the Hartwigs, said any legal
action will be announced on the anniversary of the blast Thursday.
``The Navy is not going to get away with trashing of the Hartwig
family name with its uncorroborated accusations,'' he said.
   The future of the Iowa is uncertain. One of four Iowa-class
battleships, the second-largest such ships ever built, the Iowa has
nine 16-inch guns that can hurl projectiles as heavy as Volkswagen
Beetles as far as 23 miles.
   Launched in August 1942, it is the only warship with a bathtub,
which was installed for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Iowa
won nine battle stars in World War II and two battle stars in Korea.
   Changes in Eastern Europe have Navy officials reconsidering its
usefulness. But former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman Jr., who
brought the Iowa out of retirement in 1983, said mothballing the
ship is a mistake.
   ``We still need naval power to deter and contain state-sponsored
terrorism,'' Lehman said. ``The battleship, next to the carrier, is
the most effective and important means of deterrent.''
   Three months after the explosion, the battleship left on a
deployment to the Mediterranean with the damaged gun turret sealed,
then returned to its Norfolk base in December.
   Today, the Iowa is at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard undergoing $13
million in preparations for mothballing.
   ``We will hold a private memorial service April 19 for the
ship's crew and the families of men killed. It's really something
very private _ the best way for us to remember our shipmates,''
said Lt. Cmdr. Brad Goforth.
   A plaque listing the 47 sailors who died, including Hartwig,
will be dedicated. The Iowa's commander, Capt. Fred Moosally,
called Hartwig ``a good sailor and a good shipmate.''
   The families don't want to see the warship in mothballs.
   ``She belongs at sea,'' Mrs. Ziegler said. ``There is the pride
of all the guys who went to sea on her, who fought on her. That's
how she needs to be remembered _ proudly riding the waves. That
ship carries the ghosts of 47 men in her turret.''

<HEAD>U.S. Congressional Delegation Barred From Cam Ranh Bay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. congressional delegation was
barred from a former American base in Vietnam but assured that
Soviet forces at the facility will leave by 1992, the head of the
group said Saturday.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder also said she was told by Vietnamese
officials in Hanoi on Friday that a reported offer to allow U.S.
forces to use the base at Cam Ranh Bay in the future was taken out
of context.
   The Colorado Democrat is leading a seven-member delegation from
the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee on a tour of
Southeast Asia.
   Schroeder said in an interview in Bangkok that the delegation
wanted to see facilities at Cam Ranh Bay and the level of Soviet
presence there, but Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam
said he could not authorize the visit.
   ``(Thach) said the Soviet Union would definitely be out by 1992.
We thought it interesting that they said that so emphatically,''
Schroeder said. ``No one had even heard that specific date before.''
   She quoted the Vietnamese officials as saying the pullout was
not tied to negotiations that could lead to a U.S. departure from
the Philippines.
   The delegation is assessing the military balance in the region
and seeking possible new sites for U.S. military bases in the event
of a pullout from the Philippines.
   Officials also said remarks they reportedly had made to U.S.
congressmen about the possibility of American warships being
allowed to use the base again were taken out of context, Schroeder
said. Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., recently said senior Vietnamese
officials told him in Indonesia they could foresee a day when U.S.
warships would allowed back.
   A U.S. State Department official said last week it had received
no offer from Hanoi about Cam Ranh Bay.
   The Soviet Union took over the U.S.-built base at the end of the
Vietnam War in 1975. Moscow says it maintains only a token presence
there now.
   U.S. leases at its two largest overseas military bases, Clark
Air Base and Subic Naval Base in the Philippines, as well as on
four smaller ones, expire next year. Negotiations to renew the
leases begin May 14. The talks are likely to be difficult because
of rising anti-American sentiment in the Philippines.
   Although Washington has said it would like to retain the bases,
it says it is prepared to abandon them if the opposition is
overwhelming or the price for new leases too high.
   Before visiting Vietnam, Schroeder traveled to Singapore in
response to Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew's offer to allow the U.S.
to expand its facilities there. On Sunday, the delegation is to
travel to Indonesia.
   On Friday it also visited Phnom Penh for talks with Hun Sen,
premier of the Cambodia's Hanoi-installed government.
   In addition to Schroeder, the members of the delegation are Rep.
David Martin, R-N.Y.; Ben Blaz, R-Guam; Rep. James Courter, R-N.J.;
Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah; Rep. Larry J. Hopkins, R-Ky.; and Rep.
Norman Sisisky, D-Va.

<HEAD>India Ready for `Any Eventuality' with Pakistan, Premier Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India will be prepared for ``any
eventuality'' with Pakistan if border tensions between the two
nations escalate, Prime Minister V.P. Singh warned Saturday.
   Pakistan has deployed radars and armored regiments close to the
Indian border and is readying its airfields for war, Singh told
reporters.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their
independence from Britain in 1947. Relations between the two south
Asian neighbors have become increasingly strained in recent weeks
over the northern region of Kashmir along their border.
   Pakistan had already ``sounded a red alert, which is the last
word'' on war preparations, Singh said.
   In Islamabad, a Pakistani Foreign Ministry official labeled
Singh's allegations as a ``figment of (his) imagination.''
   Singh's statements proved that India was trying to provoke a
war, said the official, who by practice cannot be named.
   In India's far north Moslem militants on Saturday freed a former
member of the state legislature a day after he was abducted, the
United News of India reported.
   Amirullah Khan, 75, was abducted from his home in Shopian near
Srinagar, 425 miles northeast of New Delhi. Khan is a member of
former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party.
   Khan was set free because of ``mounting pressure'' by security
forces, the news agency said without elaborating.
   Violence mounted in northern Jammu-Kashmir state, the center of
the tensions between India and Pakistan, as a grenade thrown by
militants exploded near an army truck, wounding three soldiers,
police said.
   A round-the-clock curfew entered its eighth day in Srinagar, the
capital of Jammu-Kashmir, as police arrested 100 people in their
search for the killers of three kidnapping victims.
   Prominent industrialist L.M. Khera and Kashmir University Vice
Chancellor Mushir Ul-haq and his secretary were found shot to death
last week. Moslem separatists had demanded the release of three
rebels in exchange for the men, but the government refused.
   In the past week, police have detained more than 1,000 people in
their search, security officials said.
   Kashmir is disputed by India and Pakistan, and two of their
three wars were focused on the region, now divided by a cease-fire
line monitored by the United Nations.
   Moslem separatists in Kashmir say they want an independent
country, attached neither to Moslem Pakistan or India, whose
population is 82 percent Hindu.
   At least 270 people have been killed since the government
launched a crackdown on Moslem separatists in the Kashmir valley in
January.
   Crowds filled the streets in villages in Kashmir Saturday,
shouting anti-Indian slogans, and security forces were rushed in.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   Army vehicles went door-to-door in Srinagar, the center of the
separatist campaign, offering food to residents who have been
forced to stay indoors since April 7, the day after the kidnappings
occurred. But residents in several sections of the city refused the
food, shouting anti-government slogans and calling for Kashmir
independence.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in India with a Moslem majority.

   The winners of a $1 million jackpot in the state
lottery last week must have felt a tinge of deja vu _ the same
couple picked up another million in the lottery 3{ years ago.
   Victor and Janice Russell, both 48, held the single winning
ticket for the $1 million jackpot in Wednesday's Pick game, lottery
spokeswoman Lisa Honebrink said Friday.
   The couple from Stanfield, a small community about 40 miles
south of here, also won $1 million in an instant game in August
1986. To win that game, they sent three losing ``scratch'' tickets
in for a drawing.
   For their Pick victory, each received the first of 20 annual
checks for about $19,000, after taxes.
   Ms. Honebrink said the odds of winning the Pick game are 5.2
million-to-1.
   ``Yes, of course we feel lucky,'' said Mrs. Russell. ``And now
we just hope we're as lucky with our good health, because all the
money in the world won't buy you health.''
   Her husband said the key to winning the lottery was positive
thinking. ``I've said many times that I was going to win again,''
he said.
   The Russells, who run a truck stop, said they have no immediate
plans to give up their business.
   It's not the first time a person or couple has come in with two
big lottery wins. In 1985, a New Jersey woman won $3.9 million in
her state's lottery; early the next year, she won $1.5 million.

   Florida Democrats, sensing
vulnerability in the state's first-term Republican governor, had
been committed this year to avoiding their traditional intra-party
blood bath.
   But the Democratic plan to unify early behind one candidate to
unseat Gov. Bob Martinez underwent an unexpected shakeup Thursday
when former U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles decided to attempt a political
comeback and seek his party's nomination.
   Some Democrats welcomed the surprise candidacy of Chiles, who
was one of Florida's most popular politicians, and saw a ``dream
ticket'' in his selection of former U.S. Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy''
MacKay as a running mate.
   But supporters of the Democrats' early front-runner, U.S. Rep.
Bill Nelson, screamed foul while Martinez and the Republicans
predicted the Democrats would again self-destruct.
   ``It's just part of their struggle to figure out how they're
going to stay in power in the state of Florida when the tide is
going against them,'' said Martinez. ``They just don't have the
leadership for the future.''
   Despite a giant fund-raising effort by Republicans that already
has put more than $6 million in a re-election war chest, Martinez
is hardly a lock for a second term. Polls consistently show more
than a third of Florida's voters disapprove of his performance in
office.
   Martinez's popularity plummeted shortly after he took office in
1987 when he reversed himself on the state's ill-fated services
tax, leading to a repeal of the tax after it had been in place for
just six months.
   Anxious to take advantage of Martinez's poor standing, even
among many Republicans, the Democrats turned to Nelson _ best known
after two decades in public life for a 1986 trip into space aboard
the shuttle Columbia.
   The telegenic Nelson was considered safe in growing, diversified
Florida, where most voters get to know their politicians through
television ads.
   Nelson, whose campaign has suffered a number of embarrassing
reversals in recent months, tried unsuccessfully to keep Chiles out
of the race and then sought to paint his new rival as a tired
retread who wants back into the limelight at the expense of his
party's future.
   Nelson, 47, reminded voters that the 60-year-old Chiles retired
from the U.S. Senate in January 1989 after saying he was ``burned
out'' from nearly two decades in the nation's capital.
   ``We Democrats lost an important U.S. Senate seat two years ago
when Lawton Chiles decided he was suddenly burned out with public
service,'' said Nelson.
   ``Florida needs a vigorous new leader with a high energy
level,'' he said. ``And I can assure you that I'm not burned out.
I'm ready to govern this state.''
   Chiles, meanwhile, said he wanted to return to politics to keep
Florida from heading down the same path of slow-moving bureaucracy
and big-money politics that frustrated him on the national level.
   He spent his first full day as a candidate answering questions
about his use of medication for depression _ a development
carefully fanned by some of his political opponents. Republicans,
however, denied newspaper reports they had leaked the medical
history on Chiles.
   ``I think I was depressed about what was going on in the
state,'' Chiles said. ``Now I'm going to do something about it.''
   Chiles went from a little-known state legislator in 1970 to an
upset victory in a runoff for the Democratic Senate nomination
after walking more than 1,000 miles from the Alabama border to the
Florida Keys during a three-month span.
   From there, Chiles went on to defeat William C. Cramer in the
general election and won re-election bids in 1976 and 1982 by
landslide margins.
   Former Democratic Party Chairman Charles Whitehead, who resigned
his position a year ago to support Nelson, acknowledged Chiles was
likely to lead Nelson in early polls due to the former senator's
high name recognition.
   But Whitehead said Nelson has $2.5 million in the bank that he
can use to close the gap on Chiles, who plans to limit individual
contributions to $100 as he did in his last U.S. Senate race in
1982.
   Some Florida Democrats would rather Nelson and a third candidate
for the nomination, State Sen. George Stuart, remain in their
current jobs. Republicans already hold an 11-8 advantage among
members of the U.S. House and are threatening to take control of
the Florida Senate, where they presently are outnumbered 23-17.
   With reapportionment coming up next year, Democrats are anxious
to hang onto control when it comes time to add the state's three or
four new congressional districts and redraw state legislative lines.

<TEXT>
   Only 125 years late, a 13-piece band will play
the march ``Honor to Our Soldiers'' at a Monday night concert in
the theater where Abraham Lincoln was assassinated.
   The march was to have been played for the Civil War president
following the play ``Our American Cousin'' on April 14, 1865, at
Ford's Theater in downtown Washington.
   But John Wilkes Booth shot Lincoln during the third act,
mortally wounding him _ and the rest of the program was canceled.
   The march dedicated to Lincoln by composer William Withers Jr.
originally was written for piano. However, at Monday's performance,
which is sponsored by the National Park Service, the Federal City
Silver Cornet Band will don blue Civil War military caps and play
an arrangement scored for saxhorns _ large, deep-toned, brass
instruments.
   ``This may be the first time it has ever been performed,'' said
Mark Elrod of Gaithersburg, Md., founder of the ensemble.
   Actually, the march was played at another theater following the
fateful night, according to Lincoln assassination buff Richard
Sloan of Long Island, N.Y., who said he plans to save the details
for a magazine article.
   Sloan plans to be on hand Monday night for the concert of Civil
War songs, ending with ``Honor to Our Soldiers,'' after which the
stage will go dark.

Mercedes, Jaguar, Cadillac or BMW. But 5 percent drive Volkswagens.
   A Canadian machinist, Reid Fleming, was last year's top-ranked
player.
   ``It's just in the last couple of years that croquet has been
available to people who don't belong to country clubs or have
private courts,'' said Peyton Ballenger, a top U.S. player.
   ``Now it's played a great deal by people at all levels. Some of
our best people are not your socially elite types.''
   Ballenger, one of croquet's few club pros in the United States,
works at the PGA Sheraton Resort here, headquarters of the USCA.
   The resort's five courts will be the site this week of the USCA
National Instructional School. Some of the world's best players
will teach 50 students at all ability levels in an effort by the
USCA to increase participation.
   Lessons normally are $35 to $45 for a 1{-hour session. The
four-day school costs $450 per person or $800 a couple.
   ``Hundreds of thousands of people play backyard croquet who
don't know about this game yet,'' said Anne Frost, administrative
director of the USCA. ``As they learn about it, we see great
potential.''
   The backyard game is a distant relative of the croquet played at
the PGA Sheraton. Here the wickets are narrower _ only one-32nd of
an inch wider than the ball. The mallets are heavier, the rulebook
thicker and tempers shorter.
   ``You'll occasionally see a mallet fly through the air,''
Ballenger said.
   A novice could get frustrated just learning the names of the
various shots. There's the roquet, the bisque, the half-bisque, the
jump shot, the cannon shot, the crush shot and the continuation
shot.
   In serious croquet, tactics are as important as take-offs _
another kind of shot. The game is part chess and part billiards.
   ``They say it doesn't take a lot of coordination or stamina,''
said Marilyn Watkins, an occasional player and the public relations
director at the resort. ``But it takes an awful lot of skill and
strategy.''
   The playing field, covered with grass that resembles a golf
green, is slightly larger than a basketball court. A firm stroke
helps keep shots on line, and top players are capable of hitting
the ball 200 yards.
   Golfers often cross over to croquet, Ballenger said. Tennis
players usually don't.
   ``It tends to be a little slow for their taste,'' she said.
   Croquet is growing anyway. USCA membership has increased from
five clubs in 1977 to more than 300 this year.
   The Hall of Fame includes the late statesman Averell Harriman,
the late movie mogul Darryl Zanuck and William Rehnquist, chief
justice of the United States.
   A sport where spectators sip champagne at tournaments likely
always will be one that puts on the ritz.
   But croquet clubs are on the upswing. They now can be found in
Arkadelphia, Ark.; Rockford, Ill.; Lewisburg, W.Va.; and Keokuk,
Iowa.
   ``It has an image of being a rich person's game and an old
person's game,'' Watkins said. ``But the yuppie movement did a lot
for croquet. It was the new novelty sport and they started taking
it up _ kind of like the food processor and espresso coffee.''

   A drug company Saturday halted production at its
factory and ordered its products removed from drugstore shelves
after tests indicated that an extortionist had contaminated some of
its medicine with sulphuric acid.
   Smith Kline &amp; French said tests uncovered contamination in a
bottle of an anti-parasite medicine called Zentel after threats
were received from someone trying to extort $1 million.
   The company, a subsidiary of the U.S. company SmithKline
Beecham, said it was suspending all exports of Zentel, which is
sold in many African, Asian and South American countries under the
name Albendazole.
   Efforts would be made to recall Zentel stocks shipped overseas
since the first threat was made in early April, the company said.
   Zentel is produced only for export, but the company announced a
temporary halt of production of all medicines at its factory in
Limay, outside Paris. It also imposed a quarantine on sales of all
products made at the factory since March 15.
   The steps were taken when the extortionist, seeking to
substantiate an initial telephoned threat, informed the company
that a bottle of Zentel had been contaminated, Smith Kline said.
   ``The steps which immediately were taken provide full guarantees
in regard to the safety of the public,'' the company said.
   It said police were investigating.
   Philippe Morin, Smith Kline &amp; French's human resources director,
said the tests found traces of sulphuric acid in the Zentel. The
company did not say whether the contaminated medication would have
been lethal if ingested.
   The company provided no details of the quantity or range of
products affected by its actions, or the financial impact.
   In 1982, seven people in the Chicago area died after consuming
capsules of cyanide-tainted Extra-strength Tylenol, a pain
reliever. The case has never been solved.
   In another U.S. tampering case, a Seattle-area woman was
convicted of putting cyanide in bottles of a pain reliever, killing
her husband and a stranger. The deaths set off a nationwide
tampering scare and caused Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers Co.
to recall its non-prescription capsule medicines.

<TEXT>
   Since taking over as coordinator of the State
Department's new office of U.S.-Mexico border affairs last month,
Irwin Rubenstein has been asked to investigate cattle rustling on a
rancher's border spread and gridlock in Laredo.
   As sympathetic as he is to the rancher's concerns, the career
diplomat says, he's ``not going to be a personal problem solver for
everybody who's got something cooking on the border.''
   Instead, says Rubenstein, he intends to do just what his title
says _ be a coordinator among the many U.S. agencies that deal with
issues on the 2,000-mile border.
   ``You have to deal with not only our own national interests, but
the concerns and sensitivities of another sovereign state,''
Rubenstein said in an interview at the State Department last week.
   Rubenstein, who has spent some 30 years in Latin America with
the Foreign Service, including the past eight in Mexico, points to
the creation of his job within the State Department's office of
Mexican Affairs as one example of an increasing awareness in the
Bush administration of the border's role.
   The U.S.-Mexico border is the only place in the world where a
major industrialized country shares a boundary with a developing
nation, says Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, who a year ago
asked the State Department to create the position Rubenstein now
holds.
   The unique strip of boundary separating the two countries has
its share of special problems _ high unemployment, low income, poor
environmental conditions, including pollution in stretches of the
Rio Grande that make the river unsafe to even touch, too little
health care, and diseases more common to the Third World than the
rest of the United States.
   At the same time, trade, population and jobs continue to grow on
the border. According to the Texas Comptroller's Office, the border
region was the state's fastest growing in 1988 and 1989, spurred in
part by plant expansions in Mexico and high birth and immigration
rates.
   Rubenstein said the ``negative'' has been accentuated in the
past in the United States' dealings with Mexico on the border,
particularly drug smuggling and illegal immigration.
   Now, ``we're going to try to accentuate some of the positives,''
he said, mentioning trade and development, public works, pollution
and sanitation.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Europeans who were arrested on
suspicion of stirring up trouble between Moslems and Christians in
Cairo were ordered deported Saturday, three days after their
arrest, a newspaper said.
   The al-Ahram newspaper said in its early Sunday edition that a
prosecutor decided to release and deport the three men after
questioning them and finding no evidence they were doing anything
more than spreading ``obscure ideas.''
   The men, two Swiss and a West German, were arrested Wednesday
and interrogated on Saturday.
   Recurrent violence in recent years by Moslem activists seeking
implementation of Sharia, or Islamic law, has made the government
sensitive toward any activity that could cause religious trouble.
   Earlier Saturday, Ali Yassin, top prosecutor for Cairo's
el-Agouza district, where the suspects lived, said police reports
showed they were ``engaged in proselytizing. But we have no
evidence yet that they were trying to create religious strife.''
   He denied news reports that documents were confiscated.
   One report had said that German-language leaflets
``misinterpreted'' verses of the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Yassin said proselytizing is not an offense under Egyptian law
``unless it is coupled with action to stir up trouble between
religious communities.'' The crime is punishable by up to five
years' imprisonment, he said.
   In practice, proselytizing by Christians is frowned upon.
   Yassin identified the three Europeans as Stefan Walter and
Roland Grysyr of Switzerland and Michael Joseph of West Germany,
all in their late 20s. He did not give their hometowns.
   Reports had appeared on the government's Middle East News Agency
and in state-owned and opposition newspapers that leaflets and
other literature inciting sectarian strife were seized at the men's
apartment.
   Yassin denied it. The men ``preached in meetings and gatherings
with various people,'' he said without giving details.
   He said the three men came to Egypt about 18 months ago to study
Arabic. They lived together in an apartment in el-Agouza district,
a middle-class neighborhood favored by foreigners.
   Last month in the southern el-Minya province, Moslem militants
stoned and set fire to two Christian Coptic churches, a youth club
and Coptic-owned shops. Fifteen people were wounded and nearly 300
detained.
   Of the nation's 55 million people, between 5 million and 6
million are Christians.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela admitted
Saturday that his African National Congress had tortured dissident
guerrillas, but said the officials involved were punished and any
further torture had been banned.
   Mandela made the surprising admission in a brief airport
statement. He said the claims of some ANC guerrillas that they had
been tortured were true, that he deplored the action and promised
it would not happen again.
   ``Unfortunately, it is true that some of these people who have
complained were in fact tortured. But once the ANC became aware ...
immediate steps were taken to discipline those who were quilty of
torturing other people,'' he said.
   Mandela did not specify the punishment inflicted on those
responsible for the torture, but he said the commanders of the
camps where the torture took place had been dismissed.
   ``The ANC is against torture or any form of coercion in order to
extract information from those who are suspected of having broken
the laws and the regulations which they are required to obey,'' he
said.
   In Nairobi, Kenya Saturday, seven former South African
guerrillas said they had been tortured by ANC commanders as
mutineers.
   The guerrillas said they were tortured at two punishment camps
in Angola called Pango and Quatro. They said they were tied to
trees and flogged with whips, locked into metal transport
containers that were left out in the searing African sun, and were
beaten and kicked by ANC commanders and their jailers.
   The seven were attached to the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto we
Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), in Angola after training in East
Germany and the Soviet Union in the early 1980s.
   They said they mutinied against their leaders in 1984, were held
in detention centers and Angolan prisons for four years and then
moved to a Dakawa camp in Tanzania after being freed on
``humanitarian'' grounds.
   They quit the military wing in Tanzania last December and fled
to Nairobi, they said. They added that they were eager to return to
South Africa after seeking sanctuary in Kenya early this year.
   ``We're still waiting for word when we can go,'' Luvo Mbengo,
28, one of the ANC recruits, told The Associated Press. ``But we
still don't know what our future is.''
   Mandela attempted to downplay the incident Saturday by saying
that South Africa's white-minority government routinely tortured
and killed opponents. He said the ANC did not tolerate torture and
stopped it immediately when the incidents were exposed.
   ``Large numbers of our people have been tortured and killed by
the government. They are still being tortured today despite all our
protests,'' he said.
   A government commission has uncovered widespread evidence that
South African police and military units systematically killed
dissidents. The commission is still in progress and the government
has not taken any official action on the charges.
   Mandela also said the dissidents were not complaining against
the ANC as a whole or against him, but against the security wing of
the black nationalist organization.
   ``The ANC has responded as any responsible organization will do
when they discover such malpractices,'' he said.
   Mandela made the statement after a brief airport meeting with
European Community officials, who visited South Africa to assess
political conditions.
   He said he urged them to continue economic sanctions against the
government, because there had been no improvement in the rights
granted black people.
   He also said credit for upcoming talks on dismantling
white-minority rule belonged to the ANC because the government has
been avoiding such talks for the past three years.
   The ANC is to meet with the government May 2-4 in Cape Town to
try to clear the way to full-scale talks on sharing political power
with blacks.
   South African President F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC and
released Mandela in February in a bid to start constitutional talks.

   The government Saturday imposed nationwide
censorship on Kurdish unrest in southeastern provinces and banned
strikes in the troubled region as part of a crackdown on an
independence movement.
   The censorship decree, which went into force after publication
in the official gazette, ruled that earlier restrictions to the
news coverage of incidents in the region apply to all publications
in the country.
   ``The restrictions will apply to all publications no matter
where they are published,'' State Minister Mehmet Yazar announced
after a Cabinet meeting Friday.
   Press restrictions, punishable by a $40,000 fine, were widened
because there is no strong local press in Turkey, and most of the
publications are based in Istanbul.
   The government on Tuesday empowered the regional governor to ban
publications or close their printing plants when they carry stories
or analyses not based on announcements made from the regional
governor's office or which threaten law and order.
   The Tuesday decree allows the regional governor to ban strikes
that threaten law and order and permits expulsion from the region
of residents deemed threats to public order.
   The governor, Hayri Kozakcioglu, is in charge of 11 provinces
where Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for an independent
Kurdistan. Twenty-one suspected Kurdish guerrillas were killed and
15 others were wounded in one of the largest anti-guerrilla
operations last weekend.
   A group of guerrillas attacked a village in Pervari township and
killed seven villagers on Tuesday and two guerrillas were killed in
a clash with security forces in Tunceli province Friday.
   Turkish newspapers reported Saturday that the leftist weekly
2000'e Dogru, which gives wide coverage to the Kurdish problem,
would not appear at newstands on Sunday as the company which
printed the magazine for the past three years canceled the contract
and did not publish it this week as a result of the government
decree.
   Since 1984, about 2,500 civilians, guerrillas and security
forces have died in the clashes in the southeast tied to the
independence bid. The guerrillas belong to the Kurdish Labor Party,
a Marxist group which has camps in neighboring Syria, Iraq and Iran.
   On March 20, about 10,000 people held demonstration in Cizre in
support of the Kurdish Labor Party. Security forces were fired upon
and fired back. Four people were killed and nine wounded.
   The crowd set fire to official buildings. Turkish flags were
torn and shops were closed for eight days.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of
55 million.

<HEAD>Contras Vow To Fight; Sandinistas Accuse Rebels Of Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Contra rebel commander said his
forces will remain armed until the Sandinistas surrender all power,
and the Sandinistas on Saturday accused the rebels of a rural
attack.
   Jose Saenz Montenegro, who leads more than 700 Contras and goes
by the nom-de-guerre Commander Chilimate, said his forces will not
give up until the incoming government of Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro has assumed all power.
   ``The Sandinistas must first turn over their arms because they
could wipe out the rebels,'' the 32-year-old rebel commander told
The Associated Press in an interview Thursday in Los Chiles, a
mountain town 130 miles by road northeast of Managua.
   Mrs. Chamorro is to be inaugurated president April 25, but the
leftist Sandinistas led by President Daniel Ortega have not made
clear when they will relinquish all power over the military. The
Sandinistas have said that refusal by the U.S.-backed Contras to
disband could threaten the transition.
   Nicaragua's Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday that
Contras attacked government troops Wednesday. The rebels attacked
Sandinista troops 80 miles north of the capital in Esteli province,
it said.
   The Sandinista government statement said three rebels died and
two government soldiers were wounded in the attack.
   However, a British journalist quoted peasants in the province as
saying that four Sandinista soldiers and one rebel died in the
incident.
   Israel Galeano, the Contra military leader known as Franklyn,
recently said in Honduras that his troops would continue fighting
in the mountains of Nicaragua ``until a true democracy exists in
this country.''
   Galeano was quoted as saying that he didn't believe the Chamorro
government would be able to control the military despite promises
by the Sandinistas to remain politically neutral in their control
over the military.
   Saenz said: ``Our brother fighters have complete confidence in
Franklyn's decision. He will guide us in the mountains where we
are.''
   He said the Sandinistas agreed to the free elections only
because of military pressure by the Contras and that Mrs. Chamorro
``must recognize that we obligated (the Sandinistas) to bring about
free elections in Nicaragua.''
   Galeano has criticized the United States for not providing funds
to resettle the rebel army it funded for nine years.
   Rebel leaders have been quoted as saying they plan to meet this
week with representatives of the incoming Chamorro government ``to
negotiate a definitive cease-fire.''
   The war killed an estimated 30,000 since it began in 1981, two
years after the Sandinistas toppled the rightist government of
Anastasio Somoza.
   Mrs. Chamorro's United National Opposition beat the Sandinistas
in the Feb. 25 balloting.
   U.N. peacekeeping forces began arriving in Honduras last Monday
to oversee the demobilization of the 12,000 Nicaraguan rebels, most
of whom had been in camps along the border in Honduras until
recently.
   About 9,000 Contras have returned to Nicaragua, leaving behind
1,000 wounded rebels at base camps in Honduras. Those camps will be
dismantled starting Wednesday.

   A prosecutor is warning the rap group 2
Live Crew that he won't let them be as ``Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   The rappers will risk an obscenity arrest at a concert Wednesday
if they sing sexually explicit lyrics, Alachua County State
Attorney Len Register said Friday.
   ``We were furnished a copy of the lyrics this week,'' Register
said. ``It's the most filthy thing I've ever encountered.''
   Although sales of some of the band's recordings have been banned
in four Florida counties, this is the first time the rappers
themselves have been threatened with arrest.
   The band will be allowed to play if it keeps its act relatively
clean, Register said.
   There was no answer Saturday at the group's Miami recording
studio or their attorney's office.
   Craig Cinque, manager of Central City, the nightclub where the
appearance is scheduled, said he doesn't know the Crew's song list
and doesn't understand why Register is showing an interest now
after ignoring previous shows by the same group.
   ``Whatever they do, it's their show. The songs they choose are
totally going to be in their control,'' Cinque said. ``They've
played here before and it wasn't a problem, so I don't see why
there should be a problem this time.''

   Best-selling authors often know little
about people and get away with it because ``they have no shame,''
Norman Mailer says.
   Among his observations during a wide-ranging talk Friday night
at the University of Iowa: ``Liberals are tiresome,'' and the
Soviet Union is no ``evil empire.''
   ``They can't even make soap. How can they make a missile that
can hit me?'' said Mailer, who visited the Soviet Union before
Mikhail Gorbachev came into power.
   ``Russians have kept alive their love of literature. Russians
have literature that kept them alive, free and independent,'' he
said. ``It dealt with, `Why am I here?' `Is there a God?' `Am I
evil?' `Am I good?'''
   ``The most difficult thing about being a writer is there are no
answers. There are only questions,'' said the 67-year-old author of
``The Naked and the Dead'' and ``The Executioner's Song.''
   ``Best-sellers are usually written by people who know very
little about people,'' he said. ``They get away with it because
they have no shame.''

   The San Francisco Giants have granted
indefinite leave to pitcher Steve Bedrosian, whose 2{-year-old son,
Cody, was diagnosed last week as havaing leukemia.
   ``It's up to him and his family when he comes back, however
long,'' manager Roger Craig said Friday.
   ``Steve should take as much time as he needs with his family
before coming back, as those concerns are so much more important
than baseball,'' said general manager Al Rosen.
   The child suffered from a fever and pain in his right shoulder
and on Tuesday a lump was found on his forearm. He underwent tests
Wednesday and Thursday, and the diagnosis was made Friday.
   Dr. Will Straw, the team physician, said chemotherapy will
probably start immediately. Bedrosian left the team last Tuesday in
Atlanta and flew home to the Bay Area. A relief pitcher, he joined
the Giants last year in a trade with the Philadelphia Phillies and
was on the All-Star team.

   An ecology anthem by the country music
group Alabama had down-home inspiration _ a fishing trip.
   The title of ``Pass It On Down'' came about when Teddy Gentry
learned his boyhood fishing hole was polluted, the bassist said in
a recent interview.
   ``Me and my son was fishing one day in the river,'' Gentry said.
``A friend of mine told me, `You know you can't eat any of the fish
that feed off the bottom there.' And it kind of hit me real strong,
because I'd lived there all my life.''
   Gentry said he turned to his 10-year-old son, Josh, that day and
said, ``You may not be able to do what I'm doing, taking your son
down to the river to catch some fish.''
   ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist to picture what's
going on in the song,'' Gentry said. ``I'm hoping that on his way
to the factory in the morning, the everyday guy is listening to
this song, and it starts wheels turning in his head.''
   Alabama was named the Academy of Country Music's artist of the
decade in 1989.

   Readers who want to know the most
intimate details about Cher are going to have to look elsewhere,
because ex-husband Sonny Bono says his planned book won't be the
kiss-and-tell variety.
   ``I told the publisher the last thing I wanted to do was an

   ``I just talk for hours about my life,'' he said. ``It's sort of

   Working with a ghostwriter, the singer-turned restaurateur and
politician said he hopes to have the book finished in about six
months.
   Although he won't discuss the intimate details of his marriage
to Cher, Bono says he will talk about life during the Sonny and
Cher days of hit records and a top-rated television series. He'll
also discuss the struggle he endured to put his life back together
after the couple split in 1974.

   Lithuanian officials acknowledged Saturday that an
economic blockade threatened by Mikhail S. Gorbachev could cause
huge layoffs, but hoped that sympathetic Soviet republics would
balk at the president's order.
   In Leningrad, 5,000 people gathered at the Winter Palace for a
protest rally that included appeals to strike in support of
Lithuania if Gorbachev pursues a blockade, according to Leningrad
journalist Maxim Korzhov.
   Gorbachev gave Lithuania until Sunday to back away from its
declaration of independence or face a halt in deliveries of
exportable goods. That could include all the oil and gas used in
the small Baltic republic, as well as metal, machinery, chemicals,
cotton and automobiles.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis has said the March 11
declaration of independence will not be revoked.
   Landsbergis, speaking at a news conference shown on the Soviet
evening TV news, said Gorbachev's ultimatum would not even be
discussed until Tuesday, since predominantly Roman Catholic
Lithuania will still be celebrating the Easter holiday Monday.
   ``It is impossible to give the answer in two days. ... This is a
way to delay negotiations and try to present it as if Lithuania
doesn't want negotiations,'' he said.
   He said it was unclear whether the Soviets planned a full or
partial blockade or some other sort of limitation on Lithuania's
economic activities.
   Lithuanian economist and legislator Kazimieras Antanavicius said
a Soviet blockade would close factories, and laid-off workers may
not be able to handle losing their paychecks indefinitely. ``Many
workers live only from paycheck to paycheck, without savings,'' he
said.
   That hardship could cause the republic's government to consider
a temporary suspension of the independence declaration if necessary
to persuade Gorbachev to negotiate, Antanavicius said.
   Western advisers to the Lithuanian government have said the
republic's economic survival is tied to its ability to maintain its
trade with the Soviet Union.
   But with at least four other Soviet republics and numerous
localities now controlled by progressives who support Lithuania's
bid for independence, Lithuania is hoping for gaping holes in
Gorbachev's blockade.
   Lithuanian leaders said they expected some republics with their
own independence movements to resist Gorbachev's order.
   ``We don't think individual republics will go along with this,
especially republics like Azerbaijan and Georgia, which want
independence,'' said Aidas Palubinskas, a spokesman for the
Lithuanian parliament. ``They understand they are going to be in
the same boat.''
   Latvia and Estonia, the other two Baltic republics, are also
pressing for independence, though more cautiously than Lithuania.
On Friday, they signed an economic cooperation agreement with
Lithuania that promises mutual aid in emergencies.
   Landsbergis told reporters Saturday night that Lithuania is
trying to contract directly with Soviet enterprises for its
supplies, according to Edward Tuskenis, another parliament
spokesman. The Soviet system still requires most deals to go
through Moscow ministries.
   Several weeks ago, a representative from the largest Soviet oil
fields, located in Tyumen, appeared in Vilnius to ask if Lithuania
would buy directly from his enterprise.
   Reacting to Gorbachev's threat, Landsbergis expressed relief
that Gorbachev chose economic pressure rather than military force.
``We expected worse,'' he said.
   In the month since Lithuania declared its independence, the
Kremlin has alternated between making threats and conciliatory
offers. Soviet troops have occupied some buildings in Vilnius, the
capital, and conscripts who refused to serve in the Red Army have
been detained.
   Speaking of the latest threat, Landsbergis was quoted by the
independent newsletter Glasnost as saying: ``The government of
Lithuania foresaw this and was ready for it immediately after the
declaration of independence.'' He said the republic can continue
one or two months, but even then, ``it is not a death blow for us.''
   Most important, ``Lithuania cannot starve,'' Palubinskas said.
It produces more meat and milk than it consumes, so customers in
Moscow and Leningrad would see their already meager food supplies
shrink, he said.
   However, weeks before the declaration of independence, a
parliamentary commission reported that oil and gas supplies would
be critical in the drive for freedom. Buying them on the open
market would be vastly more expensive than paying subsidized Soviet
prices.
   ``At world market prices, we would be running a deficit of $700
million for oil alone,'' concluded a summary of the parliamentary
report printed in the newspaper Lithuanian Review.
   The same report said Lithuania produces 60 percent of certain
Soviet television parts and 30 percent of key tractor components.
The Soviet economy is already tottering from inefficiency and
political strikes.
   In addition, Lithuania might retaliate by demanding world prices
for exporting Soviet oil, gas and other products through its Baltic
Sea ports, particularly Klaipeda.
   Officials of the republic hope Western countries will come to
their aid, particularly with oil. So far, though, there have been
no public promises.
   On Saturday, President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain urged Gorbachev to drop his threat and open talks with
Lithuania.
   ``Now is no time for escalation,'' Bush said after he and Mrs.
Thatcher met for talks in Hamilton, Bermuda.
   Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Saturday that if
Moscow uses coercion instead of dialogue to keep Lithuania in its
fold, ``there will be a penalty to pay in terms of Russia's
dealings with the West.''
   Hurd, who spoke in an interview with Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency, did not elaborate.
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday met with Gorbachev aide Vadim
Zagladin, but Vatican officials declined to say what was discussed.
The pontiff sent an Easter telegram to Cardinal Vincentas
Skadkevicius of Lithuania, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.

   Two newspaper editors fired for refusing
to quit as leaders of an anti-abortion group will file a
discrimination complaint with the help of a religious defense group.
   The Rutherford Institute said Friday its staff attorneys would
help John Kennedy and Terri Lambertsen pursue the religious
discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
   The announcement of assistance came as dozens of protesters,
some carrying pictures of aborted fetuses, picketed the offices of
The Fairfield Ledger, where Kennedy was news editor and Ms.
Lambertson was People Page editor.
   The journalists were fired Monday because they refused to give
up their posts with the newly formed Southeast Iowa Pro-Lifers. Ms.
Lambertsen is president and Kennedy is secretary.
   The paper said they were violating a policy against being active
in groups that receive news coverage.
   Kennedy and Ms. Lambertsen have complained that their
constitutional rights to free speech and religious freedom were
violated.
   John Whitehead, the institute's president, said he respected the
newspaper's desire to guard its reputation.
   But, he added in a statement: ``No employer, in the news
industry or elsewhere, can claim a veto power over the free-speech,
free-association and religious-freedom rights of its employees. To
hold otherwise would be unconstitutional, un-American and dangerous
to democracy.''
   Jan Nierling, the editor of the six-day-a-week afternoon
newspaper, declined to comment on the institute's announcement
Friday, saying she had not studied the statement. On Saturday, a
person answering the telephone at the paper said Nierling was out
of town, and that the paper still had no comment.
   Nierling said earlier that the paper had no choice but to fire
the editors to protect its credibility.
   Whitehead said he expected the complaint to be filed within
several weeks. He said a decision had yet to be reached on whether
the complaint would seek reinstatement with back pay or damages or
both.
   The newspaper, with a circulation of about 5,000, lost 30
subscribers as a result of the dismissals and three small
businesses had canceled advertising, Nierling said earlier. But the
paper was ``getting incredible support from the community,'' she
said.
   Since it was founded by Whitehead in his basement in Manassas,
Va., in 1982, the institute has grown to 25 state chapters and has
an annual budget of about $800,000, said Michael Patrick, the
executive director. The institute now makes its home at
Charlottesville, Va.
   Last year, the institute defended a Milwaukee Journal
receptionist who was fired over anti-abortion activities. The paper
later said that the decision to apply its ethics code to a
receptionist was an error.
   The non-profit organization's 40 staff attorneys handled more
than 100 cases last year involving more than 700 clients, and is
supported by public donations, he said. Most of the cases were on
religious freedom issues.

<HEAD>Inquiry Questions Ship's Crew, Officials End Search for Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Saturday completed their
search for victims of a fire that swept through a ferry last
weekend, and an inquiry heard testimony from an engineer who cited
tense relations among crewmembers.
   The search has ended for victims on board the gutted hulk of the
10,500-ton Scandinavian Star ferry moored in a Swedish port, and
officials estimated 160 dead and one person unaccounted for, said
police in Oslo, Norway.
   A list of the victims' names will be issued Monday, police said.
   Fire broke out on the Danish-owned ferry on April 7 during an
overnight run between Oslo and Frederikshavn, Denmark. It was towed
to Lysekil, Sweden.
   Norwegian police have estimated that 534 people were aboard the
Scandinavian Star, including 97 crew members. The exact number may
never be known because passenger lists did not include young
children who traveled free and people who boarded in cars.
   American entertainer Ruth E. Rome, 27, of East Lansing, Mich.,
was missing and presumed killed.
   Police believe that the fire, which started in at least three
places, was deliberately set, and they are investigating reports
that the arsonist could be a disgruntled crewmember.
   Manuel Martins, the second engineer, told the fourth day of an
inquiry in Copenhagen that the atmosphere between the 16 men in the
engine room was tense during the week before the fire.
   He, along with his Portuguese colleagues, had language
difficulties with the Filipino machinists, Martins said. The chief
engineer was a West German.
   Police officers on the inquiry panel, which includes lawyers and
marine officials, have asked each of the 12 witnesses called so far
whether they'd heard of any trouble among the crew.
   Martins and the other Portuguese were irritated because the
Filipinos had the only keys to the engine room tool chests. Martins
said he'd been unable to get access to the tools he needed during
the entire week before the disaster.
   The motors in several of the Scandinavian Star's lifeboats were
out of order, and the motors of two of them were removed, Martins
said.
   Earlier witnesses spoke of malfunctioning fire doors and
defective fire equipment. None of the witnesses knew the ship's
emergency plan or what their own task was in case of fire.

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and PLO officials are
considering the formation of a Jordanian-Palestinian federation
that would follow a Middle East peace accord, a senior PLO
representative said Saturday.
   Mahmoud Abbas, an executive committee member of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, made the report after a two-hour meeting
with Prime Minister Mudar Badran to prepare for a visit by PLO
chief Yasser Arafat.
   ``The confederation is an issue which was proposed some time
ago, and it is accepted to both sides,'' Abbas said.
   ``And I believe it would not probably be implemented now, but it
is in our minds, it exists, it is desired and it is the ideal
solution for both of us.''
   He said the confederation idea would be a main topic of
discussion between King Hussein and Arafat, who is scheduled to
visit Amman later in the week.
   There was no immediate comment Saturday from Jordanian
officials. However, the Jordanians lately have said the idea of
confederation should be discussed after a Palestinian state is
established.
   The PLO and Jordan agreed in February 1985 to work for a peace
settlement with Israel that would lead to a Palestinian state
confederated with Jordan.
   Such a status was intended to help overcome U.S. resistance to a
purely independent Palestinian state, and backers argued
confederation would benefit both countries economically and
socially.
   Despite the collapse of the 1985 plan a year later, the PLO has
continued to advocate confederation.
   The PLO declared its own Palestinian state in November 1988,
three months after King Hussein renounced sovereignty over the
Israeli-occupied West Bank in favor of the PLO.
   Although it did not define the borders of its state, the PLO
said it would roughly encompass the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
are occupied by Israel.
   About half of Jordan's 3.1 million people come from Palestinian
families who fled their homes during wars with Israel. Jordan ruled
the West Bank from 1949 until it was captured by Israel in 1967.
   Abbas said Arafat also would discuss the perceived threat of
heavy Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel and the occupied
territories due to relaxed Soviet immigration rules.
   He said the PLO was negotiating with the Soviet Union, the
United States and Europe ``to halt the influx of Soviet Jews to the
occupied territories.''
   Abbas welcomed a statement Friday by U.S. Senate Republican
leader Robert Dole that he would try to reverse a recent Senate
resolution recognizing undivided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
   The Israelis captured parts of Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle
East War and later annexed them. They have declared the city their
capital.
   The Senate resolution is not binding on the U.S. administration,
which considers east Jerusalem to be occupied territory whose
status should be decided by peace talks.

   A 12-day janitors' strike that caused trash
to pile up at Madrid Airport ended Saturday after a wage increase
was agreed on, a union spokesman said.
   Normal work crews were to return to work late Saturday to clean
up the facility that handles thousands of passengers and 500 daily
airline flights during the Easter holidays.
   Restaurant employees and waiters had taken to wearing protective
face masks to avoid the stench and possible respiratory infections
from the garbage.
   The accord included a $42 increase in monthly pay, $4 less than
the workers were demanding, said the union spokesman, who asked not
to be identified.
   Average base pay for cleaning workers in the Madrid area is $523
a month, according to union statistics. The legal minimum wage in
Spain is $472 a month.

   The ancient desert sport
of camel racing is going high-tech with the first artificial
insemination of the breed, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Scientists at the Sheik Khalifa Genetic Research Laboratory have
successfully removed and artificially fertilized ovules of famous
racing camel breeds, said the state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad.
   The report described the artificial impregnation as ``a
scientific breakthrough in the field of racing camels.''
   Camel racing, a former nomadic pastime, is a big sport in the
Arab Gulf states, where millions of dollars are spent on races each
year.
   Billionaire sheiks and princes all along the Arabian Peninsula
have given a new lease on life to desert camels, breeding them for
the November-April season, when desert temperatures cool to a
tolerable 95 degrees.
   Al-Ittihad said the laboratory on the farm of Crown Prince Sheik
Khalifa Bin Zayed had achieved successful artificial impregnation
after 16 months of research. It quoted officials at the laboratory
for its report.
   United Arab Emirates scientists were aided by counterparts from
Australia _ which also has camel racing _ in applying advanced
methods normally used on horses and livestock in the West, the
report said.
   Top racing camels can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars
and prizes at bigger meets run as high as $250,000.

<HEAD>Hotel Fire Deaths Among Elderly Track National Pattern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Fontana Hotel blaze that killed
nine people proved once again how vulnerable the elderly are in
fires, experts say. Though the building housed young adults and
children as well as old people, the youngest victim was 75.
   ``I believe they couldn't hear,'' said Max Goldstein, 84, who
got out with his wife, Gertrude, after hearing the manager's
warning and the fire alarm April 6 at the Miami Beach hotel.
   ``No, it's because they couldn't get out,'' said his neighbor,
Sylvia Pollen, noting one woman who used a walker died in the
elevator and another victim had difficulty walking.
   ``A mixture of both,'' Goldstein concluded as he waited in line
last week for a chance to return to his top-floor room in the
three-story hotel destroyed in the pre-dawn fire.
   The 102-room hotel built in 1951 met fire codes, and
investigators are dealing with a devastating death toll in a sound
structure. The ages of the victims ranged from 75 to 93.
   Investigators have not determined the cause, but on Friday ruled
out arson and placed the starting point in a crawl space next to an
elevator shaft.
   Fire Chief Braniard Dorris said the investigation must determine
why the fire cut the victims off from the fire exits.
   Although many Miami Beach hotels are retirement homes, the
Fontana's 100 residents ranged from babies to frail seniors.
   ``It wasn't a building that housed only the old elderly or that
housed the disabled elderly,'' said police Detective Jim Hyde. ``It
had a very big mix among the tenants.''
   Fires kill people age 75 and older at three times the national
average, and almost one-fifth of fire victims age 65 and older are
bedridden or physically handicapped, according to the National Fire
Protection Association.
   The elderly are more likely to die because smoke aggravates any
respiratory problems, and they tend to walk upright rather than
crouch or crawl to avoid smoke, said Leeann Steinberg of the
American Association of Retired Persons.
   The Fontana fire had other aspects that made it typical of fatal
fires. The fire began about 3 a.m.; the U.S. Fire Administration
reports fatal fires are most common between 1 and 3 a.m. And all
but 1.4 percent of deaths are recorded in buildings, like the
Fontana, without sprinkler systems.
   ``There has never been a multiple fatality in a properly
sprinklered building,'' said Tim Butters, spokesman for the
10,000-member International Association of Fire Chiefs in
Washington.
   Existing hotels and motels in Florida will be required to
install sprinklers by October 1991, and Dorris estimates 25 to 30
hotels along the high-rise studded beach already have complied or
are installing systems now.
   Fontana residents commended a Romanian immigrant family who
bought the hotel for $1.6 million last June for making major
improvements, but a $150,000 sprinkler system was still ahead.
   Asked if sprinklers would have saved lives, Hyde said, ``The
people in the fire marshal's office think definitely.''
   Goldstein, who has alternated six months at the Fontana and six
months in New York City, isn't sure what his plans are now.
   When his wife wanders into the hotel parking lot, where debris
is stacked 10 feet high beside the building, Goldstein shakes his
head and says: ``She thinks she's still at the hotel. She's in bad
shape.''
   ``Believe me, I'm not right,'' he says, stressing he is still
absorbing the fire losses. ``I'll be 110 when I get through with
this.''

   Communist Party General Secretary
Gombogavyn Ochirbat has reaffirmed his willingness to work with new
opposition parties in introducing democratic reform.
   A new party Central Committee on Friday re-elected Ochirbat to
the post he first was given one month ago after opposition protests
forced out the old party leadership.
   ``We shall take a position of mutual understanding, cooperate
with (the opposition) and hold political dialogue,'' Ochirbat told
a television interviewer Friday night at the conclusion of an
extraordinary party congress.
   The opposition, inspired by the fall of communism elsewhere in
the Soviet bloc, has emerged since December to demand a share of
power. The nation has been ruled for nearly seven decades by the
Communists, formally known as the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party.
   In a session that ended just before dawn Friday, the
extraordinary congress elected the new Central Committee, paring it
down from 146 members to 91. It also rewrote the party constitution
to make it more democratic.
   The new Central Committee met immediately to confirm Ochirbat in
his post. It also reappointed four other members of the party's top
decision-making body, the Politburo, and added a sixth member,
Sumya, who was culture minister until midweek.
   The Central Committee gave the Politburo a new name, the
Presidium, but did not change its basic function or powers.
   The new party constitution, however, abolishes the formal
requirement of absolute obedience to the center, and allows local
party bodies to raise objections to orders from the top. It also
gives them a small degree of financial independence.
   Ochirbat also promised that people being laid off in a
reorganization of the government will be given new jobs. Last week,
the government disbanded two ministries or ministry-level
committees and merged two with other ministries. News reports said
about 2,000 people would be laid off.
   Meanwhile, the new challenge to authority in the political
sphere spread to the already-stagnant economy as workers at two
Soviet joint ventures went on strike.
   About 150 truck drivers at a Soviet construction company in the
city of Darhan walked off Saturday morning to protest plans to lay
them off, said Javkhlant, a member of the opposition Mongolian
Democratic Association.
   He said about 34 workers at a Soviet joint venture coal mine in
Baganuur struck earlier in the week for better working conditions,
but agreed to return to work at least temporarily Saturday while
awaiting a response from the company.
   He said Mongolian Democratic Association members were on the
strike committees, but had not started the strikes.
   The government already has warned that national industrial
output in the first quarter fell from last year, and it has blamed
the growing mood of lax discipline.

<HEAD>Children From Crime-Ridden Housing Project to Exhibit Art at

<TEXT>
   Eleven-year-old Isaiah Brooms, whose bedroom wall
was pierced by a bullet one night while he slept, once dreamed he
saw his artwork ``in a painting museum.''
   Starting Monday night, Isaiah comes close to that vision when
one of his drawings goes up at the Quinlan Gallery. The gallery in
a fashionable North Side neighborhood is featuring art by children
from Cabrini-Green _ one of the nation's most notorious housing
projects.
   ``I think the kids will be proud of themselves,'' said gallery
owner Mickey Quinlan, who mounted the show to help celebrate the
25th anniversary of a tutoring program at Cabrini.
   The exhibit, titled ``Cabrini's Creations,'' will feature the
work of about 125 children and run through the end of April.
Proceeds from sales of their work will go to charity.
   The show had its seeds in a meeting last year between Quinlan,
the mother of 11, and Isaiah. She liked his artwork and included
two pieces in a show.
   ``I felt like I was special, because I never had my pictures
hung up in a gallery before,'' said Isaiah, a sixth-grader who
wears clear-framed eyeglasses that slip down his nose.
   This year, Quinlan was motivated to extend the opportunity to
other children from Cabrini, and the result is the exhibit that
opens Monday.
   Isaiah's contribution to the current show is a crayon drawing
showing favorite childhood pastimes: bowling, playing video games,
shooting basketball hoops, and getting pop from a soda machine. But
instead of depicting each activity in a wide long shot, Isaiah does
closeups of hands: hands with balls, hands with video games, a hand
on a pop machine.
   One of the other works in the show has the words, ``Art is
free'' written on it, Quinlan said. ``It just makes you feel real
good. It almost makes you want to weep,'' she said.
   One mile to the south of the gallery, Cabrini-Green is a zone of
78 battered apartment buildings operated by the Chicago Housing
Authority, home to about 13,800 people. About three-fourths of them
are children.
   Seventy-five percent of CHA residents are unemployed, and 85
percent of families are headed by single women, CHA spokeswoman
Lucille Wallace said.
   To children from Cabrini-Green, the Quinlan Gallery neighborhood
is ``another world,'' said Geraldine Mansueto, who tutors Isaiah.
   ``These kids don't get a lot of recognition,'' she said. ``For
them to be in a gallery on Halsted Street in Lincoln Park _ that's
something that's out of their ken.''
   Even with tighter security measures in some buildings, violent
crimes including murder, rape and arson are being reported at a
rate of more than one a day at Cabrini, 1989 CHA statistics show.
   Isaiah's mother, 33-year-old Clara Brooms, described entering
her son's bedroom after a night of gunfire about three years ago
and discovering a bullet hole in the wall above his pillow.
   ``When I woke up, I said, `God, all this shooting.' I said, `Let
me go in, my baby could be dead.' I got in there, and the first
thing I saw was the hole right over his head.
   ``Then I went to the window and said, `Oh, my God!'''
   The security measures have helped improve the picture somewhat
since then, she and Isaiah said.
   Derek Ellis, another exhibit participant from Cabrini-Green,
draws in pencil, producing likenesses of figures in magazines and
pictures. Derek, 14, shares a bedroom with his 12-year-old sister
and 8-year-old twin brothers. The boys sleep in one bed, their
sister in another.
   Derek says he thinks about becoming an artist or a pro
basketball player some day. Isaiah says he wants to be either a
professional artist or a data processor _ or both _ when he grows
up.
   One time, Isaiah said, ``I dreamed my stuff was in a painting
museum,'' like the Art Institute of Chicago.
   Isaiah's tutor says he ``likes being the best.''
   ``He likes being No. 1,'' she said.
   ``I think that's going to save him more than anything else.''

<HEAD>NASA Removing Space Telescope Batteries for Recharging</HEAD>

   NASA opened Discovery's payload bay
doors Saturday to remove the Hubble Space Telescope's batteries for
recharging and to replace a faulty part in preparation for an April
25 launch.
   Technicians took out a faulty auxiliary power unit responsible
for grounding the shuttle last week. A new unit was being installed
to be tested Sunday and fired up briefly later this week.
   ``We haven't run into any problem,'' said Lisa Malone, a
spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
``We're looking good for the 25th.''
   Hubble's six nickel-hydrogen batteries will be recharged for 5{
days in a laboratory at the Vehicle Assembly Building. NASA decided
to take the batteries there because they can be recharged at a
cooler temperature and thus retain more power.
   ``We will have a higher capacity in them than we would have had
we been recharging at the pad,'' said Fred Wojtalik, a NASA project
manager. ``This will make the opportunities for additional launch
days a lot easier for us.''
   The batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected
from the shuttle's power system during deployment until its
energy-collecting solar panels are unfurled.
   Discovery was poised for launch Tuesday, but the mission was
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff when the auxiliary power unit
failed.
   NASA was not sure how long it would take to replace the 88-pound
unit because the procedure had never been performed before at the
launch pad. The work went smoothly, Malone said.
   The defective power unit was returned to the manufacturer,
Sunstrand Corp. of Rockford, Ill., for testing.
   The shuttle's three auxiliary power units pressurize the
hydraulic system, which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces
and in the ship's braking and steering systems.
   NASA planned to close Discovery's payload bay doors Sunday as
soon as the lengthy process of removing the batteries was
completed. The chamber will remain sealed to reduce the risk of
getting too much dust on the telescope's 94-inch mirror, the finest
ever made, until the batteries are returned next weekend.
   The $1.5 billion telescope is NASA's most expensive and complex
payload. Once it is in orbit above Earth's distorting atmosphere,
it will be able to detect objects 50 times fainter and with 10
times greater clarity than the best observatory on the ground.
   Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant that
their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years,
close to the beginning of the universe.

   The first swarm of Africanized honey bees
will buzz north across the Rio Grande any day now, but scientists
say the worst sting of the ``killer bees'' may be economic.
   Researchers predict the bees probably will enter the United
States near the border city of Brownsville. In November, they were
spotted 150 miles south of the border at Soto la Marina, Mexico,
near the Gulf Coast.
   None has been found near the border since, but their advance
accelerates with as spring flowers provide food, said Anita
Collins, head researcher at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Honey Bee Research Lab at Weslaco.
   These bees, descended from a tough African strain, have been
spreading across South and Central America and Mexico since they
escaped from a now-infamous Brazilian research program in 1957.
Along the way they've killed an estimated 600 people, mostly in
tropical South America, to earn their ominous nickname.
   An Africanized bee's sting is no worse than a European bee's,
but they were tagged ``killers'' because they tend to protect their
colonies at the slightest disturbance, sending hundreds or
thousands of defenders against intruders.
   Africanized bees abscond from hives to form new colonies more
regularly than the European honey bees commonly used in the
Americas for pollinating crops and producing honey.
   The difficulty of managing Africanized bees eventually will cost
U.S. beekeepers $29 million to $58 million a year, the USDA
estimates.
   Africanized bees also are expected to reduce bee-pollinated crop
production by 5 percent to 10 percent, costing farmers more than
$40 million a year. Bee pollination adds nearly $800 million in
value, it is estimated, to U.S. crops each year.
   U.S. residents along the border aren't likely to notice much
change, beyond seeing more wild colonies and swarms of bees looking
for nest sites, said Ms. Collins, who has studied the Africanized
bees for 14 years.
   ``They'll see bees ... much more frequently than they're used
to,'' she said. Some danger remains, she said, noting that in
Venezuela a swarm chased her and other scientists to a truck about
100 yards away.
   Researchers are monitoring 318 bee traps in southern Texas, as
far west as Del Rio and as far north as the Aransas National
Wildlife Refuge north of Corpus Christi, to track the bees'
movement. There are 60,000 traps in Mexico.
   Scientists will keep an eye on southern Texas and northern
Mexico and destroy as many Africanized swarms as possible to slow
their progress and buy time for research, Ms. Collins said.
   ``We're not going to try and sit on the border and destroy every
swarm that comes across,'' she said. ``This is an attempt to reduce
these first pioneer swarms. But at some point, we're going to be
overwhelmed.''
   No one knows how far north the bees will spread before the cold
stops their expansion. In the Southern Hemisphere, they have not
moved south of 32 degrees latitude, which north of the equator
would mean Central Texas. The bees travel 250 to 350 miles a year,
Ms. Collins said.
   The first confirmed trapping in Texas will trigger an emergency
plan, although the inter-agency Texas Honey Bee Management Plan is
still being designed and has yet to get state funds.
   The first step in the plan is a quarantine keeping anyone from
moving bees out of the state's eight southernmost counties, said
John Fick, one of the state's two apiary inspectors with the Texas
Agricultural Experiment Station.
   Beekeepers will be called on to ensure their queens remain
European, since researchers believe European bees moderate the
Africanized bees' behavior through interbreeding.
   Scientists and beekeepers shun the ``killer bee'' appellation,
and the Texas Beekeepers Association has launched a public
relations campaign to tell people the Africanized bee won't be out
searching for victims.
   Fifteen to 20 people already die in the United States each year
from allergic reactions to bee stings, the association points out.
   Marilee Mace, who runs a crop pollination business with her
husband, Glenn, president of the beekeepers association, believes
beekeepers will remain the strongest line of defense.
   ``It's very important that we keep a healthy beekeeping
industry, because if we lose those bees, then we have to live with
whatever has moved into that void,'' she said. ``And we don't want
to do that.''

   An Indian immigrant leader ended a
six-day hunger strike Saturday after assurances that officials will
work to ease tensions that led to clashes killing up to 60 people
in recent weeks, a governor said.
   Altaf Hussein, who leads the Qaumi Mohajir Movement of Indian
immigrants, launched his hunger strike Sunday, demanding several
supporters be freed. They were arrested in connection with the
recent violence.
   The main combatants in the past month's political violence have
been Hussein's group and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party.
   On April 6 in Karachi, marauding gunmen killed 17 people and
wounded 55.
   Thirty people were later arrested. Half belonged to Hussein's
party and the other half were members of Ms. Bhutto's party.
   Hussein's hunger strike ended after a four-hour meeting with
Fakhruddin Ibrahim, governor of the southern province of Sindh.
Ibrahim is a member of Ms. Bhutto's party, which dominates the
provincial assembly.
   ``I'm pleased to announce that Hussein accepted my request to
call off his hunger strike in the greater interest of the nation,''
Ibrahim told reporters following his meeting.
   ``We assured him that we will work for peace in Sindh and we
will provide justice for each and everyone living in Sindh,'' he
said.
   Hussein declined to comment Saturday.
   His movement has charged its members are denied jobs and
promotions in favor of indigenous Sindhis, a charge denied by
Sindhi nationalists.
   Up to 10,000 soldiers have been patrolling in Karachi since the
start of Hussein's hunger strike.

<TEXT>
   President Bush sought more detailed
information Saturday on Moscow's threat of economic retaliation
against Lithuania, while Senate Democrats condemned Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev for taking ``precisely the wrong
approach'' to the latest crisis.
   During a rain-soaked game of golf, Bush told reporters he wanted
to withhold further comment on the situation until he received ``a
clarification'' on Gorbachev's ultimatum to the
independence-seeking Baltic republic.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, said the
administration was taking a `wait and see'' attitude.
   ``It's not entirely easy to know what the next moves are going
to be,'' Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network.
Imposition of sanctions, he added, ``would have an adverse impact''
on U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Baker would not speculate on what form a U.S. response to
sanctions would take.
   Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday
they were deeply disturbed by Gorbachev's threat to cut off
supplies to Lithuania if it did not rescind laws passed since it
asserted independence on March 11.
   A senior administration official said that the Soviet ultimatum
caught U.S. strategists off guard and that Gorbachev's move was
undergoing close analysis and scrutiny in the United States.
   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
there would probably be a further U.S. response to the action
before the end of the weekend.
   The official said, however, the range of options was very
limited _ adding to the frustration felt by the administration as
the war of nerves between the Baltic state and the Kremlin
continues to intensify.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and six
Democratic colleagues, just returned to Washington from a visit
with Gorbachev in Moscow, condemned the economic ultimatum as
``precisely the wrong approach in such a delicate and dangerous
situation.''
   At a news conference at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Mitchell
noted that on Thursday Gorbachev had expressed to the Senate
delegation ``his intention to resolve the situation in Lithuania by
peaceful, non-violent means.''
   Mitchell and Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, John Glenn of
Ohio, Wyche Fowler of Georgia, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Paul
Sarbanes of Maryland and Tom Daschle of South Dakota all expressed
dismay that Gorbachev had leveled the economic threat just a day
later.
   ``An act need not involve direct violence to be wrong,'' said
Mitchell. ``The action taken yesterday was wrong. We condemn it.''
   Mitchell said he and the other senators likely would meet with
Bush early in the week to report on their trip, which included
visits to Berlin and Leningrad as well as the two-hour session with
Gorbachev.
   Daschle said Gorbachev had told the group that ``he felt like he
had led three lives since 1975, and that this year was the most
difficult of all.'' And he quoted Gorbachev as saying that
Lithuania's political uprising was ``a gift to my hardliners.''
   The domestic Soviet upheaval was casting a pall over Bush's May
30-June 3 superpower session with Gorbachev, where both leaders
have suggested they hope to be able to initial a new agreement to
limit long-range nuclear weapons.
   A persistent, wind-driven rain did little to discourage the
president from playing 18 holes of golf on this British island
colony before heading back to the United States. He returned to
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., near Washington late Saturday
afternoon and boarded a helicopter for the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md., where he was to spend the rest of the weekend.
   Reflecting on Friday's meetings with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, Bush said, ``It's very important that we stay on
the same wave length.''
   He said his administration and Thatcher's government ``feel very
comfortable about our positions'' on East-West issues.
   Despite ``slight nuances on a few things, differences,'' the two
allies are ``very close together,'' Bush said.
   Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis, joined Bush for the soggy golf
outing. Also in the presidential party were Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, Chief of Staff John Sununu, National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft and White House physician Burton Lee.
   Asked about the latest Gorbachev threat, Bush said, ``I haven't
heard anything about anything yet. I haven't seen the intelligence
report yet. I will when I get in.''
   He said that after his joint news confernce with Thatcher on
Friday afternoon, ``I wanted a clarification'' from Moscow on
Gorbachev's warning to Lithuania. But, Bush said, ``It was midnight
over there.''
   Bush was to complete a trio of pre-superpower-summit meetings
with allied leaders next Thursday when he meets with French
President Francois Mitterrand in Key Largo, Florida.
   He conferred with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney last
Tuesday in Toronto.

<HEAD>One-Party Rule Violates Rights, Say Churches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Church leaders on Saturday criticized
plans for a one-party state and said steps to create it will
infringe on fundamental human rights in one of Africa's few
Western-style democracies.
   The Roman Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace urged
President Robert Mugabe's governing party to abandon its commitment
to one-party rule.
   The statement comes four days before safeguards for political
opposition _ guaranteed for 10 years in the 1980 British-brokered
constitution _ expire.
   ``We believe that a constitutionalized one-party state is
contrary to basic human rights,'' the 35-member commission said at
the end of a two-day meeting.
   A one-party system of government as envisaged by Mugabe's
governing Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) ``ends
up benefiting chiefly the people already entrenched in powerful
positions,'' the church commission said.
   ``No generation has the right to make immutable decisions for
future generations,'' it said.
   In one of its strongest attacks on Mugabe's policies, the
commission said the freedom to vote for a political party of choice
was a fundamental right, along with the freedoms of association,
assembly and speech enshrined in constitutional law.
   It urged the governing party to rule with a mandate based on
freedom of choice and its own efficiency and ``credibility of
performance.''
   After the governing party won 116 of 119 seats contested by five
parties in parliamentary elections last month, Mugabe said the
victory at the polls gave him the backing he needed to establish a
one-party system along Marxist lines.
   He has repeatedly argued that a plural system creates division
that hinders development.
   Since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, the governing party has
abided by the British-mediated constitution containing safeguards
for political opposition.
   Those safeguards expire when Zimbabwe celebrates its 10th
anniversary of independence from white minority rule on Wednesday,
but Mugabe has said he will not immediately outlaw opposition
parties.

<TEXT>
   In a simmering maritime feud between two
West African nations, Guinea-Bissau accused Senegal's navy of
entering its waters, seizing a Soviet fishing boat and shooting at
it, a report said Saturday.
   Guinea-Bissau has claimed the disputed section off the Atlantic
coast, which potentially contains oil, since independence from
Portugal in 1974.
   No casualties were reported in the incident Wednesday, according
to a Guinea-Bissau government statement quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
   Guinea-Bissau's foreign minister, Julio Semedo, called the
seizure of the Orleonok, ``a flagrant violantion of sovereignty ..
. and international law,'' and demanded the immediate release of
the boat, Lusa reported from Bissau, the country's capital.
   The incident is the latest in a series of clashes over a
disputed maritime frontier which have soured relations between
Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, a former French colony.
   Guinea-Bissau's navy fired on a Senegalese fishing boat in the
disputed waters last year and in January, Bissau accused Senegal's
air force of repeated violations of its airspace.
   The disputed waters lie just off the land border between Senegal
and Guinea-Bissau. The zone was listed as Senegalese territory in
1960 by an exchange of letters between Portugal and France.
   A World Court ruling upheld that decision last year.

   A man described as ``real likable'' and
concerned over the safety of older residents of his homeless
shelter was arraigned Saturday on charges of killing six of seven
black women found strangled here.
   The arrest of Ray Shawn Jackson, 22, came after another incident
Monday in which a black woman was attacked and choked by an
assailant who was scared away by a man out walking his dog.
   Associate Jackson County Circuit Judge George Aylward appointed
the public defender's office to represent Jackson and scheduled his
formal arraignment for April 25.
   Aylward continued bond at $700,000 _ $100,000 each on the six
first-degree murder charges and the same amount for first-degree
assault in the Monday attack.
   The woman attacked then, who said she was knocked to the ground
and choked by an assailant, identified Jackson from a photograph as
her attacker.
   Police Chief Larry Joiner estimated police had put in between
8,000 and 12,000 hours of investigation since Sept. 16, when the
first of the killings in or near a midtown park occurred.
   ``The police work in this was incredible, it really was,'' Pat
Peters, assistant Jackson County prosecutor, said after Saturday's
court appearance. A composite picture of a suspect was released
last weekend, after the body of Michelle Mitchell, 22, was found
April 5. The picture led to more than 300 phone calls, Joiner said.
   Information that led officers to Jackson was developed during a
neighborhood canvass Thursday by detectives. They found him at his
grandmother's home, where he sometimes stayed, and he agreed to
come to headquarters for questioning that resulted in the charges.
   Joiner said that all six women had been lured to their deaths by
the offer of obtaining crack cocaine. Probable cause statements
filed with the charges said Jackson told police he killed the women.
   Jackson's sister, who would identify herself only as Kim, told
The Kansas City Star he was someone who ``didn't want to listen.''
   Snapping her fingers, she said, ``He'd be the sweetest person
you'd ever know, and then, something would happen.''
   ``Number one, yes, my brother said he committed those murders,''
she said. ``Number two, we don't know why. He's hardheaded like any
other normal person.''
   William Johns, who knew Jackson from a homeless shelter where
they both spent time, called him ``real likable.'' He and others
there said he didn't smoke or drink and while he got into an
occasional fight, he would sometimes escort older people from the
shelter to a nearby liquor store to keep them safe.
   In addition to Ms. Mitchell, Jackson is charged with killing
Annette Stewart, 33, whose body was found Sept. 16; Kimberly Creer,
22, found Sept. 20; Tresa Williams, 21, found Oct. 22; Janice
Berryman, 36, found Oct. 28; and Tonya Ward, 23, found Jan. 18.
   Joiner said the investigation had not produced evidence linking
Jackson to the death of the seventh woman, Brenda McCoy, 33, who
was found Sept. 26.

<HEAD>Strike Continues At State Broadcasting Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 union workers at the
state-run broadcasting network went on strike Saturday, protesting
the appointment of a former government spokesman as their new boss.
   The walkout, which began Thursday, has paralyzed the KBS radio
and television network and workers pledged to continue the protests
until president Suh Ki-won resigns.
   The network's five radio stations and two television channels
remained on the air with the help of technical staffs and other
non-union members, but news programs and other live broadcasts have
been cut short or replaced with movies, documentaries and
pre-recorded dramas.
   The network's radio stations all broadcast the same program,
consisting mostly of music.
   About 5,000 of the network's 18,000 employees are unionized,
mostly reporters, producers and directors, camera crews and
administrative personnel.
   The workers claim that government's appointment of Suh, a former
government spokesman, reflects Seoul's new efforts to gain control
of the country's news media, including KBS, which is fighting for
press freedom.
   The protest began Thursday when hundreds of workers occupied a
section of the network's main office in Seoul to prevent Suh from
assuming his post.
   Suh entered his sixth floor office through an underground garage
and requested police intervention. About 500 riot police stormed
the building and arrested 117 workers.
   The protests spread quickly to the network's 26 local stations,
which also were on strike. Hundreds of local union workers traveled
to join their colleagues in Seoul.
   On Saturday, police released 10 more workers, including union
leader Ahn Dong-soo, 42, after freeing 97 a day earlier.
   About 1,000 riot police, posted in and around the network's
office, also were withdrawn Saturday in an apparent effort to
defuse the confrontation.

<TEXT>
   Some of the writing that emanated from last
spring's pro- democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square has been saved for historians in the New York Public Library.
   About 700 items _ declarations, poetry, newsletters and the like
_ were gathered in China by Robin Munro, a researcher for the human
rights group Asia Watch. The material has been donated to archives
about the pro-democracy movement around the world, including one at
the library in Manhattan.
   Munro said he started collecting as soon as he arrived in
Beijing in May on the second day of the students' hunger strike. He
left two weeks after the army moved in and suppressed the
demonstrations on June 3-4, when hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
people were killed.
   Munro's collection is the heart of primary source material in
the New York archive, which is made up of several thousand items
stored in a small metal filing cabinet and on a few bookshelves.
The archive is not imposing, but large enough to give scholars
material for analyzing the movement from many angles.
   ``Politically, we want to be impartial. So not only do we get
lots of anti-government material but we also give the Chinese
government a chance to have their material included,'' said
librarian John T. Ma, in charge of Chinese materials in the
library's Oriental Division.
   The Chinese consul general in New York responded to a request
from Ma by donating books and cassette tapes about what the
government called counterrevolutionary turmoil last spring.
   Ma said the library also obtained correspondence and other
papers from the U.S. office of the Front for a Democratic China, an
umbrella organization that includes movement leaders in exile. That
material includes personal papers of student leader Wu'er Kaixi and
the office's director, Jin Yanshi, Ma said.
   The archive also includes local material about the movement from
New York's large Chinese community, said Lucy Kung of the library's
Economic and Public Affairs Division. Ms. Kung, like Ma, is
volunteering time to solicit and organize the materials since the
library has no money budgeted for the archive, Ma said.
   John M. Lundquist, chief librarian of the Oriental Division,
said material continues to arrive, partly thanks to Ma and Ms.
Kung's extensive contacts.
   Ma said many people with materials about the movement have been
eager to donate them because of their historical value.
   ``Chinese usually are very mindful of historical mission,'' he
said. ``Chinese follow history as a guidepost, not the Bible.''
   American universities with major Chinese studies divisions also
are developing collections about the democracy movement. Lundquist
said the New York Library is working on its archive in cooperation
with such schools as Harvard, Yale and Columbia.
   Munro said he also gave copies of his collection to archives at
Harvard and the British Library, as well as others in Hong Kong,
Chicago and Liden, the Netherlands.
   The New York collection also includes a tape of music composed
by Taiwanese musicians that was played during Tiananmen Square
demonstrations, a videotape of a news conference by Chinese
officials, and video footage of televised news reports from around
the world showing how the story was reported.

   A would-be purse-snatcher who threatened
two women, saying he had a weapon, was overpowered and held by the
women until police arrived, authorities said.
   ``He said, `I have a knife.' So I gave up trying to hold onto my
purse. But my daughter jumped on him and I had to help her. He was
tall, but not strong,'' said Rumiko Sera, 57, of the attempted
robbery Wednesday.
   ``I just wanted to detain him,'' said Sera's 31-year-old
daughter, Ann Kunitake. ``He kept saying that he had a knife and
was going to kill us. I didn't believe him. If he did, why didn't
he bring it out?''
   Bystanders helped the women hold onto the man, who ``kept
spitting on the men and saying he was going to give them AIDS,''
Kunitake said.
   Police arrested Lino Ochoa, 28, for investigation of robbery.
   Ochoa pleaded innocent Friday to unrelated charges of robbery
and assault with a deadly weapon, said Deputy District Attorney
Michael Pargament. He said Ochoa also is accused of two other
purse-snatching incidents, and allegedly has been driving a car
that was reported stolen April 3.

   Adolph Archie died, messily, after 13 hours
in the custody of police who arrested him for the fatal shooting of
a police officer.
   He had a cracked skull, a crushed larynx, a shattered face and
too many bloody bruises to count, according to the autopsy his
family commissioned.
   ``There is no question: This man was beaten to death,'' the
family's attorney, Mary Howell, said last week at a news
conference. ``If I may be more specific, he was stomped to death.''
   The allegations have led to investigations by police, Orleans
Parish District Attorney Harry Connick and U.S. Attorney John Volz.
   Civil rights leaders, meanwhile, accuse Orleans Parish Coroner
Frank Minyard of releasing an incomplete autopsy report and of
trying to cover up a homicide to protect the police. They demand
that he resign.
   No one disputes that Archie, a black man, was a career criminal
or that he killed police officer Earl Hauck, a white man.
   ``He should have been arrested, tried and executed for killing
that policeman,'' said the Rev. Marie Galatas, head of the city's
Grass Roots Organization for Women. ``But he should have gone
through a court system.''
   GROW and Southern Christian Leadership Conference officials say
police officers have told them confidentially that four officers,
three white and one black, were involved in beating Archie.
   The civil rights groups have declined to release details on
those allegations, saying the officers fear for their jobs and
won't go public.
   Archie, 40, had nine criminal convictions behind him when he ran
away from a parish prison work detail on March 8.
   On March 22, police said, a security guard surprised him while
he was breaking into a parked car at the Louisiana Superdome.
Archie punched the guard, stole her gun and ran.
   Hauck, directing traffic downtown, joined the chase and was
fatally shot after cornering Archie near an office building loading
dock. Archie hid under a parked car. Police pulled him out.
   Then, the story becomes cloudy.
   Archie, shot in the forearm and slightly injured during the
chase, apparently also suffered some injuries while being pulled
from under the car, but the extent of his injuries isn't clear.
   He was taken to Charity Hospital, but wasn't admitted.
   Hauck, too, was taken to Charity, where he was pronounced dead.
   Police Chief Warren Woodfork said police decided to take Archie
from Charity to the 1st District police station where Hauck had
worked because Hauck's fellow officers were at Charity and Archie
might be in danger there.
   At the police station, police said Archie tried to grab a gun
and was knocked backward, hitting his head on the floor. There were
no reports that might account for the numerous other injuries
Archie suffered.
   Archie was held for about 45 minutes before police decided to
take him back to Charity, where he was admitted.
   The next morning, Archie was lying on a table, awaiting a CAT
scan, when he became agitated, ripped a tracheal tube from his
throat and died before the tube could be reinserted, according to
hospital reports and Minyard, the coroner.
   The direct cause of death, said Minyard, was the removal of the
tracheal tube. ``I'm saying that the man received a trauma in
police custody, but that did not cause his death,'' the coroner
said.
   That's not entirely true, says a report by Dr. Kris Sperry, a
Fulton County, Ga., forensic pathologist hired by the family
attorney to do an independent autopsy.
   Archie needed the tracheal tube because of severe injuries
inflicted in a fight with one or more people, Sperry said in his
report, which concludes that ``the manner of death is homicide.''
   Minyard's staff autopsy lists many of the injuries Sperry found,
but makes no specific references to injuries of Archie's chest,
abdomen and testicles, Sperry said.
   And, while Minyard reported a single fracture to the skull,
Sperry's report lists two fractures, beginning on opposite sides of
Archie's head and extending to the back of the skull.
   Woodfork said last month that he saw no evidence of wrongdoing,
but police have had no comment since then, saying their
investigation is under way. Since Sperry's report came out last
week, Minyard has declined comment on the case.
   At an April 4 news conference, Minyard said his staff's autopsy
was as thorough as it could be given the limited time available _
about two hours _ in an office that deals with at least one murder
almost every day.
   Minyard wouldn't speculate on when Archie suffered the fractured
skull or broken facial bones listed in his and other autopsies.
   The coroner said he believes police accounts of Archie's
handling. He also admitted to a bias in favor of the police.
   ``I mean, we had two murders this morning,'' he said. ``Every
day I work with homicide. And if I don't believe them, I mean, the
whole system breaks down. I have to believe what they tell me.''

   Senior advisers to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
declared at a special session Saturday that delays in carrying out
economic reform are no longer possible, Tass reported.
   Gorbachev convened his advisers to discuss plans for a
controlled market economy, the state-run media said.
   On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin said economists
have been unable to draw the final outline of radical reforms to go
into effect this summer.
   Without a transition to a market economy, the Soviet Union has
``no future as a highly developed great power,'' Abalkin said.
   The Soviet economy is plagued by lagging productivity and severe
shortages of consumer goods.
   Several officials have suggested the Soviet Union was developing
an economic ``shock therapy'' plan that would raise prices,
drastically cut the value of the ruble and raise unemployment.
Poland has a similar program.
   Speakers at Saturday's session agreed that delays in
implementing economic reform were no longer possible, Tass, the
official Soviet news agency, reported.
   The participants decided to continue their session this week,
Tass said without elaboration.

   Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski went to the
Katyn Forest on Saturday and paid tribute to the thousands of
Polish army officers killed and buried there by the Soviet Union's
secret police during World War II.
   His visit came one day after the Soviet government reversed
nearly 50 years of official denial and admitted committing the
massacre. The Soviet Union had long blamed Nazi Germany.
   ``The truth was said about Katyn, and the truth is healing the
wounds,'' Jaruzelski said in Russian, his voice soft and wavering
with emotion.
   ``Now it will be easier for us to understand each other,'' he
told Soviet reporters. The Katyn massacre has long been a strain on
relations between the Soviet Union and Poland.
   Jaruzelski was accompanied by an honor guard of the Polish army
at the memorial site in the forest near the western town of
Smolensk as he honored the more than 4,000 officers killed in 1940
by Stalin's secret police, the Polish PAP news agency reported.
   A ``roll call of the dead'' was intoned _ a ceremony in which
the names of victims are read, PAP said.
   In footage broadcast on Soviet TV's evening newscast ``Vremya,''
Jaruzelski, wearing a green army overcoat, green scarf and military
cap, stood ramrod straight as two soldiers carried a large wreath
of red and white carnations and laid it in front of a memorial to
the dead.
   The monument reads in Russian: ``To the Polish officers fallen
in Katyn.''
   Polish radio reported Saturday night that the wording on the
monument was changed three days ago, removing the words that blamed
Nazi Germany. The Soviets had long said the Nazis were responsible
for the massacre, in which the Polish officers were shot in the
back of the head and stacked on top of each other in mass graves.
   The honor guard fired a rifle salute, Polish radio said.
   PAP added that Jaruzelski wrote in the visitor's book:
   ``They fought for an independent Poland. They died innocently,
far-removed from their families and homeland. They were faithful to
Poland and to military honor until they breathed their last. In
tribute and in lasting memory to Polish officers, victims of the
cruel Stalinist crime.''
   Jaruzelski also went to the town of Lenino in the nearby
republic of Byelorussia and laid wreaths on the graves of Soviet
and Polish soldiers at a memorial there, the Soviet news agency
Tass reported.
   The Soviet Union on Friday admitted that the NKVD, Stalin's
feared secret police, was responsible for the murders 49 years ago
of the Polish officers who had been captured at the start of World
War II.
   The Soviet statement Friday said archive material discovered
recently showed that the murders were the work of Stalin's secret
police chief Lavrenti Beria, his protege V.N. Merkulov and others.
   ``The Soviet side, expressing its deep regret in connection with
the Katyn tragedy, states that it is one of the most horrifying
Stalinist crimes,'' said the statement, carried by Tass.
   More than 10,000 other Polish officers were killed in camps
elsewhere. Their bodies never have been found, but in its
statement, the Soviet Union clearly tied together the fates of all
15,000 officers.
   Jaruzelski's trip to Katyn capped an official visit to the
Soviet Union. He returned to Warsaw later Saturday.
   At a dinner Friday night, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
called the Katyn tragedy one of the historical ``knots'' that cast
a shadow on Polish-Soviet relations, but he added that ``many of
them have already been undone.''
   In remarks carried by Tass, Gorbachev said ``genuine renewal and
genuine mutual understanding lies only through telling the truth.''
   Jaruzelski told the Soviet leader that the Soviet admission on
Katyn was ``particularly important and valuable to the Polish
people from the moral point of view,'' and he said Poles would not
blame the massacre on the Soviet people who themselves suffered
under Stalin.

<HEAD>Hail in Texas, Rain Falls Across South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Large hail fell along a fast-moving cold front in Texas on
Saturday, and rain fell across the South and into the Great Lakes
region.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were scattered from eastern
North Carolina to southern Florida. Showers also scattered rain
along the northern Rockies and upper Plains.
   Rainshowers prevailed from Kentucky northward to the lower Great
Lakes region, and the cold front pushed showers and thunderstorms
from coastal Texas to western Tennessee.
   A twister damaged several buildings in southeast Texas, and
funnel clouds were sighted in northern Texas, but no injuries were
reported.
   In Bay City, the tornado demolished a wall of a wholesale
distributing company and broke windows at Pierce Elementary School
and a sporting goods company.
   ``We've got trees down all over town, and one fell on a vehicle,
but there was no one in it,'' said police dispatcher Isa Cox.
   Large hail fell Friday in central Oklahoma, where golf ball-size
hail was reported six inches deep along Interstate 40 near El Reno,
Okla., the National Weather Service said.
   A tornado also was spawned southeast of Watonga, and winds
gusted to 75 mph at Okarche in Oklahoma.
   The hail-producing thunderstorms continued early Saturday, as
large hail fell across much of north central Texas. Softball-size
hail was reported northwest of Rotan, Texas.
   Winds pushed by offshore thunderstorms gusted to 59 mph at Port
Arthur, and high winds were reported in Houston and Galveston. A
car was blown off the road and downed trees and power lines at
Bevil Oaks, also in the region.
   Winds damaged roofs west of Galveston Bay, and small hail fell
over parts of Galveston Island.
   Heavy rain fell in north central Texas, and parts of Dallas and
western suburbs were flooded.
   Heavy rainfall for the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m. EDT,
included more than 1{ inches at Palacios, Texas. Almost 1 inch fell
at College Station, Lufkin and Houston in Texas, and at Fort Polk,
La.
   The nation's low for early Saturday was 20 degrees at Concord,
N.H.

<HEAD>City, County Clash Over Handling Of Mapplethorpe Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With public sentiment now behind an art
gallery exhibiting controversial photographs, city and county
prosecutors are arguing over who should handle obscenity charges
against its director.
   And city council members are suggesting the widely publicized
case involving a collection of photographs by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe is a losing cause.
   Sentiment against a city prosecution appeared to grow following
the release of a poll Friday indicating strong public support for
the gallery. Fifty-nine percent of those who responded to a poll
conducted for The Cincinnati Post said they believe the photographs
should be displayed.
   Councilman David Mann said the poll ``confirms my belief that a
conviction is virtually impossible.''
   The city's solicitor and Hamilton County prosecutor Arthur Ney
plan to meet again Monday to resolve the dispute over prosecution
of the Contemporary Arts Center and Director Dennis Barrie, who is
to be arraigned Monday.
   A county grand jury indicted the gallery and Barrie last
Saturday on two misdemeanor counts each of pandering obscenity and
use of a minor in nudity-oriented matter for seven photos in the
175-picture exhibit. Two of the photos show nude children, and five
depict homosexual acts.
   Prosecutors will have to convince a jury that the photos violate
community standards in order to get an obscenity conviction.
   Several council members have called for the city to consider
dropping the charges if it ends up with the case.
   ``We can't dictate to the city solicitor whether or not to
proceed with the case, but we can certainly make our views known,''
said another councilman, Peter Strauss. ``I personally think they
are going to have a hard time making a case that the show in its
entirety lacks artistic value.''
   Ney turned the prosecution over to the city Thursday, citing
state law that requires cities to prosecute misdemeanors committed
within their boundaries. However, the law permits a city and a
county prosecutor to enter into an agreement to have the county
prosecute the city's misdemeanor offenses.
   Ney and City Solicitor Richard Castellini met Friday but failed
to reach agreement on which will handle the Mapplethorpe case. They
plan to meet again Monday morning, when Barrie is arraigned in
Hamilton County Municipal Court. Barrie has said he will plead
innocent.
   Mayor Charles Luken said he thinks Ney gave the case to the city
because he doubted he could win.
   ``I think this is a politically hot potato, and the reason Mr.
Ney is doing this is that he doesn't feel he can win,'' Luken said.
   The county prosecutor's office rejected the suggestion, saying
Ney handed the case off solely because he felt he was required to
do so under state law.

<HEAD>Jerusalem's Mayor Condemns Jewish Settlers</HEAD>

   Mayor Teddy Kollek on Saturday denounced as
``extremists'' a group of Jewish nationalists who moved into the
city's Christian sector and prompted a protest, his spokeswoman
said.
   She said the mayor also told five visiting U.S. senators he
fears the furor over the new settlement will dissuade Soviet
immigrants from moving to the city.
   Kollek, who is Jewish, criticized Wednesday's move of about 150
Jewish nationalists into the building complex in the Christian
section of the walled Old City, municipal spokeswoman Bonnie Boxer
said. She quoted him as characterizing the settlers as ``extremists
who concentrate only on themselves and their religious fervor.''
   ``Once again, Jerusalem will be portrayed as a violent city and
this will harm tourism, scare away potential investors and dissuade
Soviet immigrants from choosing Jerusalem as their home,'' she also
quoted him as saying.
   On Saturday, about 50 Christian and Moslem Palestinians
demonstrated outside the 72-room complex settled by the Jews.
   On Thursday, Israeli police fired tear gas to disperse Christian
clergymen and stone-throwing Palestinians protesting the
settlement, while foreign tourists visiting for Easter week tried
to steer clear of the violence.
   In Amman, Jordan, King Hussein on Saturday said in a written
statement to The Associated Press that the Israeli police action
against the Greek Orthodox patriarch and other protesting clerics
in Jerusalem was a ``vicious and inhuman crime.'' The patriarch,
Diodoros, was overcome by tear gas during the protest.
   Also Saturday, the U.S. senators, lead by Republican Robert Dole
of Kansas, voiced their concern over the events surrounding the
Jewish settlement, including the use of tear gas to break up the
protest.
   The others in the Senate delegation were James McClure, R-Idaho;
Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   The senators also met Saturday with a group of Palestinian
leaders from the occupied terrritories. The Palestinians urged the
senators to help pressure Israel to negotiate with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Jerusalem's Old City is divided into jealously guarded ethnic
quarters that are home to 50,000 Moslems, about 7,000 Christians
and 4,000 Jews.
   The old, walled city was controlled by Jordan from 1948 until
1967, when it was captured and annexed by Israel.
   The Jerusalem Magistrate's Court ruled Thursday that the
property settled by the Jews actually belongs to the Greek Orthodox
Church and ordered the Jewish families to move out. But the
decision is under appeal, and police said they would let the
settlers remain for the moment.
   The ultra-orthodox Jews say they bought the building from a
Christian, but the Greek Orthodox Church said the complex was sold
illegally.
   In the occupied the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian accused of
collaborating with Israeli authorities died overnight of beating
injuries suffered earlier in the week, hospital officials said.
   His death brought to 207 the number of Palestinians killed by
their Arab brethren most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
   At least 673 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians during the 28-month-old uprising in the occupied
lands. Forty-three Israelis have died.

<HEAD>Washington-British Columbia Border Back to Normal After Quake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traffic at border crossings returned to
normal Saturday after a moderately strong earthquake shifted the
walls of a Canada Customs office, shutting it down temporarily,
authorities said.
   U.S. Customs Inspector John Nolte said the crossing between
Blaine and Douglas, British Columbia was closed to northbound
trucks after the quake, which registered 5.1 on the Richter scale
at 10:33 p.m. PDT Friday.
   The quake was followed by about a dozen aftershocks, the
strongest registering 4.1 on the Richter scale, said scientists at
the University of Washington geophysics center.
   Unloaded trucks were diverted to the Peace Arch crossing and
loaded trucks to the crossing between Sumas and Huntington, British
Columbia, about 20 miles to the east.
   A few trucks were allowed to pass after about 9 a.m., and
traffic was back to normal by noon without major delays or backups,
Nolte said.
   Geophysicist Steve Malone said the quake occurred about three
miles underground and three miles northeast of Deming, a town about
10 miles east of Bellingham.
   Walls at the Canada Customs office in Surrey, south of
Vancouver, were moved ``about a quarter of an inch,'' said
superintendent Glenn Bonnett.
   The building was closed overnight but was reopened after a
structural inspection and operations appeared to be normal by
midday, said U.S. Customs agent Randy Reed.
   Earthquake monitors at the university said there were reports of
minor damage in three Washington counties, including broken glass
and items jolted from shelves. A canopy at the Blaine
border-crossing also was cracked, they said.
   County officials said callers who said they felt the quake
reported no damage was reported other than pictures falling off a
wall.
   Linda Twitchell, a Bellingham Herald copy editor, said she was
in her recreation room when the quake hit and wondered briefly
whether it would ruin the new addition to her home.
   ``It actually looked like the walls were moving in different
directions,'' she said.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Wally Beketa of nearby Custer.
``The bed shook. The mirrors danced on the walls.''
   There were no reports of damage in British Columbia.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake measuring 4 is capable of causing moderate damage,
5 considerable damage, and 6 can be severe.

<HEAD>U.S. Agency Says Americans Still Worry Over European Unity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. International Trade Commission says
American business still worries that greater unity among western
Europeans will lead to a ``Fortress Europe'' designed to protect
their businesses against American goods and services.
   It lists a long series of measures being taken by the 12
governments in the European Economic Community to bring freer trade
with one another by 1992. The U.S. interests that could be hurt
range from the sale of insurance to the showing of American
television shows.
   In a thick report on developments in the community, also known
as the Common Market, the commission recently made a point of
American objections to European proposals for reciprocity: the idea
that European firms should get the same treatment in America that
American firms get in Europe.
   American firms prefer a different interpretation: that they get
the same treatment in Europe as European firms give themselves.
   Of a proposal about mergers in the European insurance business,
offered by France, the report said: ``Another reciprocity clause,
albeit seemingly innocuous, will not assist in putting to rest the
idea of `fortress Europe.'''
   President Bush's administration has been asking for more
influence on the Europeans' decisions. As a result, leaders from
the European Commission will come here April 23, headed by its
chairman, Jacques Delors. It will be the first of a regular series
of such meetings to take place twice a year.
   They will talk with Secretary of State James M. Baker III and
other U.S. Cabinet members. Delors also will meet with Bush.
   The Europeans are expected to spend much of their visit, as
other visitors have done, arguing that removal of barriers to trade
among themselves poses no danger to American interests. The
American commission, an independent body appointed by successive
presidents, is less sure.
   ``Since the United States is outside the EC (European
Community), measures that reduce internal barriers but leave
external barriers unchanged cause trade diversion, that is,
increased trade among EC member states at the expense of trade
between the United States and the EC,'' it said.
   Its study is called ``The Effects of Greater Economic
Integration Within the European Community on the United States:
First Follow-Up Report.'' Dated for March, it was distributed to
reporters this week.
   On the television issue, American pressure helped soften a
European proposal to require that 60 percent of all broadcasts in
the 12 countries originate in one of them. A European directive
adopted last October asked some preferential treatment for programs
originating in Europe. But it set no binding limits, leaving each
of the member governments to set them if they choose.
   ``The U.S. government and the U.S. industry have continued to
object to the local content provisions of the directive both on the
grounds that they are protectionist and that they interfere with
freedom of expression,'' the U.S. commission said.
   It also saw possible benefits to U.S. business from greater
unity in Western Europe. American industry that competes with
European exports will benefit as European products go more to
European countries rather than overseas, it said, and added that
any measures to reduce European barriers against imports will lower
the price of American goods to European buyers.

<HEAD>Two More Bus Shootings Reported</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents Saturday investigated two more
Greyhound bus shootings that caused no injuries, the company said,
and an official of the striking workers' union denied any
responsibility for the violence.
   A bullet ricocheted off a San Antonio-bound bus at a Dallas area
freeway interchange just before midnight Friday; hours later, a
gunshot struck a bus en route from Birmingham, Ala., to Nashville,
Tenn., said Greyhound spokesman Kevin Fry.
   Greyhound condemned the latest violence, which now totals more
than 32 shooting attacks. The company says it won't negotiate with
striking drivers and other employees until a week goes by without
incident.
   ``We are hopeful we will get information to go on with these''
latest shootings, said Greyhound Lines Inc. spokesman George
Gravley in Dallas. ``This is outrageous.''
   The company's offer of a $100,000 reward for information leading
to arrests in violence against buses and their occupants applies to
the latest shootings, said Gravley.
   An Amalgamated Transit Union representative in Dallas denied
that strikers were responsible for the latest violence and said he
had doubts about the Texas report.
   ``The word I got was it was just a little indentation'' on the
side of the San Antonio-bound bus, said ATU representative Donald
Hardin. ``I have very serious doubts about that one. If it was a
bullet, it wasn't from any of our guys. We have been very peaceful
here.''
   The Texas bus had no passengers aboard at the time of the
shooting, said Fry. The bullet struck the bus about 5 feet, 10
inches off the ground, near an American flag painted on its right
side.
   The bus, which continued on to San Antonio after the driver
discovered the damage, was met by police and U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents.
   The investigators ``determined it was a small- to mid-caliber
bullet fired from a handgun, fired from behind the bus and it
ricocheted off the bus, never penetrating the skin,'' Fry said.
   The second shooting occurred on a Nashville-bound bus with six
passengers aboard, said Fry. Its driver was at an undetermined
location on Interstate 65 when gunfire hit the eastbound bus about
3:20 a.m.
   Investigators from the FBI and ATF were looking into the
shooting along with state and local authorities, said Fry. Both
agencies di not immediately return calls from The AP.
   On March 2, Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 office and
maintenance workers walked out in an argument over wages and job
security. The company has been operating a reduced schedule since,
using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross picket
lines.
   Greyhound, besides the shooting attacks on buses, has reported
70 bomb threats and more than 100 other incidents of violence.
   The unions have also reported violence directed at them. A
picketing driver, 59-year-old Robert Waterhouse, died when he was
crushed by a bus driven by a replacement driver in Redding, Calif.
No charges were filed in that case.

   Pope John Paul II ushered in Christianity's
holiest day in the light of small candles held by thousands of
faithful at Easter vigil services Saturday night in St. Peter's
Basilica.
   Preceded by cardinals and bishops in a slow procession toward
the altar, the pope carried before him a long white candle he lit
to open the service commemorating the night Jesus Christ rose from
the dead after his crucifixion.
   In other Easter observances, peace activists from both Germanys
protested together for the first time during traditional holiday
marches Saturday.
   The German custom of Easter marches for peace dates back to the
1950s, but protests were held separately in East and West Germany
for decades until the border opened during East Germany's popular
revolution last fall.
   The cavernous St. Peter's Basilica, the largest church in
Christendom, was dark and silent late Saturday as the procession
moved toward the altar under the ``Baldacchino,'' the Baroque
canopy designed by 17th century sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini.
   After the third chanting of the ``Lumen Christi'' (Light of
Christ), the the congregation began lighting candles to symbolize
the ``pilgrimage from darkness to light.''
   Earlier Saturday, the Polish-born pope met with an aide to
Mikhail S. Gorbachev one day after the Soviet president threatened
to impose an economic blockade on the rebellious Baltic republic of
Lithuania.
   A Vatican spokesman, Monsignor Piero Pennacchini, said the
30-minute private audience was requested by Vadim Zagladin, a
special adviser to Gorbachev. But the spokesmen did not say whether
it touched on the crisis in Lithuania, which declared independence
from Moscow on March 11.
   Casimir Lozoraitis, an official of the Lithuanian mission to the
Holy See, said he had been informed by ``informal contacts'' that
the pontiff's meeting included a discussion of Lithuania, but there
were no details.
   The pope also sent an Easter message to Lithuania, which is 80
percent Roman Catholic.
   ``In this hour of trepidation and hope, I am particularly near
to the Lithuanian church,'' the pope said in Latin in the telegram
sent to Cardinal Vincentas Skadkevicius of Lithuania. An Italian
text of the telegram was provided by the Vatican.
   During the Easter vigil, the pope baptized 19 people from 11
countries.
   After a Mass lasting into the early morning hours Sunday, the
pope had little time to rest before Easter morning, which he will
celebrate with an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square. At noon, he
will give his ``Urbi et Orbi'' (to the city of Rome and the world)
message from the balcony overlooking the square.

   Customers of a McDonald's restaurant
that serves an estimated 1,200 people a day have been urged to get
shots if they ate there during the working hours of a teen-age cook
diagnosed with hepatitis.
   Only co-workers and the restaurant's patrons during the worker's
three shifts between March 31 and April 7 were advised to get the
gamma globulin shot, said Dr. James Howell of the state health
department.
   Health officials don't know how many people were exposed to
hepatitis A, which is spread by poor personal hygiene, poor
sanitation and intimate contact. Its symptoms include fever,
nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine and jaundice.
   The employee, who cooks fries, is on sick leave and will return
to work when he is healthy, Howell said. His name wasn't released.
   In 1988, 28,000 hepatitis cases across the country were reported
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. In 1989, cases
increased 30 percent to about 36,000. CDC officials say they can't
explain the increase.

<HEAD>Iraqi Steel Tubes Reportedly Connected With Satellite Launcher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The steel tube sections seized en route to Iraq
and suspected by Customs officials to be parts of a huge gun could
be connected with a space satellite launch system, government
sources were quoted as saying Saturday.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoted
unidentified ``reliable government sources'' as saying they had
correspondence linking British industry with the Brussels company
Space Research Projects, described as dealing in international arms
sales.
   The correspondence refers to orders for the manufacture of
smoothbore pipes that experts believe match the specification
detailed in the Belgian company's design for a space satellite
launch system, the sources were quoted as saying.
   It was not clear from the report whether the link consisted of
more than a match in specifications. The report did not name the
British manufacturer allegedly involved.
   In December, Iraq surprised other nations by launching a rocket
it said could be used to put a satellite into space.
   Press Association said the British sources made known the
correspondence to explain the interest of the Customs and Excise
department in the steel tubes being held for investigation at
Middlesbrough on the northeast coast of England.
   Engineering experts stressed that the orders could be placed in
such a way that the manufacturers would believe they were providing
pipe work for the petroleum industry.
   Press Association did not name the government department of the
sources, but The Sunday Telegraph, The Sunday Times, and the
Observer all carried articles quoting Customs sources on the same
subject.
   The consignment being held at Middlesbrough was to have been
loaded on a ship bound for Iraq when Customs officers seized it
Tuesday.
   In the days since, Iraq has claimed the metal tubes were pipes
for a petrochemical plant. The British manufacturer, Sheffield
Forgemasters, said their work was not intended for armaments and
was known to the government.
   Customs, however, said the eight pieces of steel tube could
unquestionably be used as a huge gun barrel.
   Arms experts have given conflicting opinions about whether the
steel sections could be used as a weapon.
   The Belgian company mentioned in the Press Association report,
Space Research, was owned by Dr. Gerald Bull, an American
ballistics expert.
   Bull, 62, a Canadian-born American citizen, was slain March 22.
Belgian police said he was shot twice in the head. They said the
gunman used a silencer and the motive was not robbery because
$20,000 was found in the victim's pockets.
   Jane's Defense Weekly said Bull had been a principal designer of
South Africa's G5 howitzers, which have been sold to Iraq.
   Britain banned all arms sales to Iraq and its enemy Iran
following the outbreak of the 8-year-old Persian Gulf War. There
has been a cease-fire since August 1988, but Iran and Iraq are
still not officially at peace and the British embargo remains.

<TEXT>
   Worries about California's fourth
straight year of drought seem far away on the lush oasislike
fairways of the Coachella Valley, billed as the golf capital of the
world.
   Because Palm Springs has its own underground supply, water is
plentiful in this desert resort, which boasts 80 golf courses, each
soaking up roughly a million gallons of water a day. Perhaps
nowhere else in California is the metaphor ``Cadillac desert'' more
apt than here, where plush turf spreads like rich green velvet
across desert sands.
   In contrast, even a modest front lawn will go thirsty by law
this year in the coastal resort of Santa Barbara, which is forced
to rely on local runoff. In the fertile Central Valley, water
supplies to farmers are being reduced by 50 percent. Los Angeles
residents face a 10 percent cut in their water consumption, and in
San Francisco, officials are considering rationing water.
   Such are the incongruities of the state's worst drought in more
than a decade, as the prolonged dry spell separates the water haves
from the have- nots.
   The area also faces its worst fire threat since there was a
seven-year drought in the late 1940s, according to the Los Angeles
fire department. Residents of the city's hills and canyons,
fire-prone even in the best of years, have until May 1 to clear
brush from around their homes, or the city will do it for them and
send them the bill.
   Until this year, Los Angeles and its environs have had
sufficient water delivered hundreds of miles by aqueducts. But
their allotment has been cut, and water agency officials say that
even when the rains come, supplies may never return to normal.
   Even without a drought, studies have shown, the region's
ever-increasing water demand will outstrip supplies by the year
2000.
   ``We're looking at real, honest-to-god, bona fide shortages,''
said Timothy Quinn, director of conservation at the powerful
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves a
six-county region with 14.5 million people. The district is holding
two days of hearings on the shortage beginning Monday.
   For the first time since California's post-World War II growth
boom, the district has been unable to take all the water it wants
from the Colorado River.
   The agency's usual allotment of 1.2 million acre-feet was
trimmed by the federal government this year by 300,000 acre-feet,
and as neighboring Arizona draws more of its share, the MWD's
allotment could be cut by almost 700,000 acre-feet.
   Each acre-foot _ enough water to cover an acre of land one foot
deep or about 326,000 gallons _ supplies two average families for a
year.
   Many communities throughout Southern California are enacting
conservation measures.
   Santa Monica, for example, is requiring that ultra-low flow
toilets, which flush just 1{ gallons, be installed in all new
construction and remodeling projects.
   Los Angeles years ago enacted a five-phase drought ordinance
whose first phase can be activated any year by the mayor. Phase 1,
which bans routine serving of water in restaurants and hosing of
driveways already is in effect, although such measures are not
widely observed or enforced.
   Mayor Tom Bradley urged residents last month to cut back water
use by 10 percent, and officials warned that more stringent
measures will be needed if voluntary conservation doesn't work.
   Los Angeles usually gets about 15 percent of its supply from the
MWD. But this year the city has asked the agency to meet about 60
percent of its 700,000 acre-feet demand because of cutbacks in its
own supplies.
   ``Whatever can go wrong has gone wrong,'' Quinn said.
   Santa Barbara faces the drought's worst impact _ along with
other communities on California's Central Coast, said Bob Fingado
of the state Department of Water Resources.
   The region, which encompasses nearly 1 million people from
Ventura to Santa Cruz, doesn't have links to state and federal
aqueducts.
   ``They live on what they get (locally),'' Fingado said of the
Central Coast.
   In Santa Barbara, for example, local runoff has been 20 percent
of normal for each of the past three years, Fingado said. This
year, it has been just 10 percent of normal.
   City officials are attempting to cut water use by 45 percent in
the city of 82,000, said Pete Ramsdell, a city spokesman.
   Santa Barbara officials announced recently they are considering
a number of options to increase water supplies, ranging from a
seawater desalination plant to the importing of fresh water from
Canada on barges.
   Some of the alternatives could cost nearly 100 times more than
current rates, water officials said.
   In San Francisco, the city water department's acting manager,
John Mullane, said Friday that officials ``are looking at
rationing'' for the department's 2.2 million customers. He
projected a possible 25 percent cutback, the same amount that was
cut the last time there was rationing in 1988-89.
   Even in Palm Springs, there is concern. The valley sits atop a
geological bathtub that holds an estimated 39 million acre-feet of
water _ more than 10 times the state's biggest reservoir _
according to officials at the Coachella Valley Water District.
   ``We're simply not recharging this basin to the extent we're
using it,'' said Allan Muth of the University of California's
Desert Research Center in Deep Canyon. ``No matter what they say,
eventually we're going to run out of water.''

<HEAD>Report of Otter Carcasses Revives Debate Over Oil's Toxic Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beach-cleaning teams at Prince William
Sound have found 40 dead otters in the past five weeks, stirring
renewed debate between government agencies and Exxon Corp. over the
effect of last year's oil spill.
   It remains unclear, however, what killed the otters. That
problem, and the carcasses, have been handed over to the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, which has legal responsibility for marine
mammal management.
   Fish and Wildlife authorities told the Anchorage Daily News
recently that otter body parts are being tested to see if chronic
exposure to oil killed the animals during the months since cleanup
and animal-collection work stopped work last September.
   Nancy Lethcoe, coordinator of the state's winter cleanup effort
at Valdez, said Friday she thinks oil that was not cleaned up after
the March 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker spill ended up killing more
otters than would die ordinarily over a winter.
   Bob Mostracchio, chief of Exxon's spill-damage assessment team,
disagreed.
   ``We've done a lot of winter beach monitoring. We've seen no
basis for concern about oil harming wildlife'' this winter, he said.
   Exxon cleanup teams will not collect dead animals this year
unless they obviously have been oiled, Mostracchio said.
   The company presumes animals killed during the winter died of
natural causes, he said, and their carcasses are part of the food
chain and ought to be left where they lie.
   Lethcoe said the Valdez teams found 28 otter carcasses during
the past eight days. They found 12 others in the preceding weeks.
Those found on specially marked oil-spill study beaches were left
alone. Lethcoe said the 40 carcasses are more than she has seen in
five winters.
   So far there are no answers, according to Tony DeGange, otter
project director for Fish and Wildlife Service's oil-spill damage
office in Anchorage.
   But there may be some clues.
   For instance, DeGange said, previous research in the Sound has
shown that most ``winterkill'' otters are either very young or very
old.
   ``The young are still learning how to survive, and the old are
in poor condition,'' he said.
   Scientists can tell the age of the dead by inspecting their
teeth. So if more than a few middle-aged otter carcasses are
collected this spring it will indicate some unnatural cause _ such
as eating oiled clams or mussels _ may be killing otters.
   Studies last summer found that spilled crude had poisoned
otters, which suffered liver and lung damage. The wildlife agency
is ordering autopsies for some of this spring's carcasses. It also
is analyzing tissue samples from others to check for oil poisoning.
   Putting the information together could take months, DeGange said.
   One obstacle is the lack of benchmark data: There has never been
a comprehensive otter winterkill survey in the Sound to compare
with this year's carcass count.
   But biologists do have baseline information on some individual
otters _ those rescued, cleaned and released last summer. Lethcoe's
group found one of those tagged otters dead, though the cause was
not apparent. It will be shipped to Anchorage with the rest.

<TEXT>
   Nine Colombians arrested on a ship carrying a
record six tons of cocaine have been convicted of possessing the
drug with intent to distribute it.
   The ship's master, seven crewmen and the 26-year-old cook, who
is 8{ months pregnant, could be sentenced to life in prison. They
were convicted Thursday by a federal court jury.
   All nine were arrested Oct. 2 by the Coast Guard, which said the
12,000 pounds of cocaine was a record confiscation from a ship
boarded at sea.
   Jurors in U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz's court returned
the verdict after a seven-day trial.
   The defendants said they did not know there was cocaine in the
locked containers loaded onto the Zedom Sea before it left
Barranquilla, Colombia, on Sept. 23.
   Prosecutors said it is doubtful the owner of $600 million worth
of cocaine would have entrusted it to a crew he did not know. They
said the cocaine was to have been transferred to another ship
before the Zedom Sea reached Mexico.
   The Colombian-owned ship was flying the Panamanian flag when it
was seized in the Gulf of Mexico, several miles off the Mexican
coast.
   Before the trial, Schwartz rejected defense claims that U.S.
officials did not have the required permission of Panamanian
authorities to board the Zedom Sea, confiscate the cocaine and
arrest the crew.
   Prosecutors said former Panamanian President Eric Delvalle gave
blanket authorization before his term expired Sept. 1 for U.S.
ships to search suspicious Panamanian vessels.
   No sentencing date has been set for the ship's master, Arsenio
Marin Pineda of Calarca-Quindi, the crewmen, and cook Leovigilda
Calderon of Giron Santador.
   Roma Kent, Calderon's attorney, said her client's baby probably
will be turned over to state welfare authorities to be put in a
foster home because the father, a small-town butcher, has no money
to come get the child.
   He and Calderon also have a 7-year-old son, who lives with the
butcher and his parents, Kent said.

<TEXT>
   A sequel to Edward R. Murrow's famous ``Harvest of
Shame'' documentary showing the deplorable conditions of migrant
farm workers in 1960 found little has changed in 30 years.
   Three decades ago, CBS cameras panned over a long line of tired,
hungry farm workers waiting for bags of food. They had just lost
their jobs to a killing freeze.
   Public Broadcasting Service shot the same scene, this time
outside the National Guard Armory in Homestead, Fla., following a
deadly Christmas freeze that dropped temperatures to 22 degrees in
the Everglades.
   The only notable difference is that one scene was filmed in
black and white and the other taped in color.
   Murrow's report shocked the nation by showing that many
Americans ate because of people who earned miserable wages and had
no sick pay, vacations and unemployment benefits or disability pay.
On top of that, the migrant workers for the most part lived in
squalid housing.
   Tuesday night, PBS will air ``New Harvest, Old Shame,'' the
story of Pedro Silva's family on the roads and in the fields of
rural America as it moves from an Indiana bunkhouse to a trailer at
the Everglades Labor Camp.
   ``Even nature is against them,'' said the producer, Hector
Galan. ``This year they faced heavy rains in Indiana that cut crop
yields in half, Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina which left them
with no work, and the freeze in Florida.''
   Galan located Pedro Silva and his wife Reina in late November
and followed him with an assistant and a photographer as the
extended family's six-vehicle convoy headed south, stopping at
highway rest areas to eat, wash and sleep.
   ``What would have been a two-day trip turned into a six-day
trip,'' Galan said. ``Pedro's truck broke down twice. Finally he
had to leave it behind because he couldn't afford to get it fixed.
Reina's nephew became ill. It was one hardship after another.''
   Mrs. Silva's sister, Maria Martinez, said she wanted to be
filmed to give farmers a hard look at the way their workers live.
   ``If all the farm workers in this country stopped working, the
farmers would have to let their fruits and vegetables rot in the
fields,'' she said. ``They have to realize that when we make money,
they make money. When we eat, they eat.''

<TEXT>
   Five million American children under the age of
6 _ almost one out of every four in the nation _ recently have been
in families living below the poverty line, according to a new
national study.
   This makes young children the poorest of any age group in
American society, with 23 percent, more than double the percentage
of adults, living in poverty, said the report by Columbia
University's National Center for Children in Poverty.
   The report, released for publication Sunday, used U.S. Census
Bureau figures and other criteria, mainly from 1987, the most
recent year for which comprehensive data was said to be available.
The center was set up last year at the school of Public Health.
   ``The issue of child poverty in the United States has received
growing attention in recent years, but available data do not
describe the depth and breadth of the problem,'' the report said.
   ``We need a firmer grasp of who these children are, what kinds
of risks they face, and how adequately current policies and
programs serve them,'' it said.
   The report said comprehensive approaches must be devised to
``assist poor young children and families over the early years of
family formation.
   It recommended universal health insurance coverage, expanded
health and child care, unemployment insurance, ``safe and
affordable'' housing, education and job preparation reforms and
programs to prevent teen-age pregnancy.
   Statistically, the study found that while 42 percent of all U.S.
children living in poverty were white, the percentage of poor among
whites overall was 13 percent, far below the rates among minorities
_ 48 percent for blacks, 42 percent for Hispanics and 29 percent
for others.
   The poverty line is a U.S. government definition of a minimum
standard, based on pretax income and adjusted for family size and
changes in the cost of living. In 1989, it was $9,890 for a family
of three and $12,675 for a four-member family.
   The report said that in 1987, 32.5 million Americans were living
below the line, of which 13 million were less than 18 years old and
five million were under 6. Another 2.7 million in the youngest
category were in ``near-poor'' families whose incomes ranged from
the poverty level to 50 percent above it.
   It said the latter were ``often indistinguishable from children
living in poverty'' because their families had as much difficulty
making ends meet, or even more if they did not receive public
assistance.
   The report also cited what it said were ``myths'' about the poor
and programs to aid them.
   It said, for example, that 54 percent of the under-6 poor lived
outside urban areas, 53 percent had at least one working parent,
and 28 percent were in families entirely dependent on public
assistance.
   Neither benefits from Aid to Dependent Children nor full-time
minimum wage income would ``alone'' put families over the poverty
line, it said. ``Typical'' aid to dependent children in 1988 was
$4,320 a year, less than half the poverty line, and minimum wage
jobs in 1987 paid $6,968, about three-fourths of the total for a
family of three.

<HEAD>Report: Bandleader Sues Over Pulitzer Prize-Winning Novel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oscar Hijuelos, whose ``The Mambo Kings Play
Songs of Love'' won the 1990 Pulitizer Prize for fiction, has been
sued by a bandleader who claims the novel has defamed her, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   Gloria Parker, who appeared in Woody Allen's 1985 movie
``Broadway Danny Rose,'' claims Hijuelos' book has made it hard for
her to get employment, New York Newsday said.
   Hijuelos won the Pulitzer on Thursday for his novel, which has a
character who is romantically involved with members of a musical
troupe called ``Glorious Gloria Parker and her All-Girl Rumba
Orchestra.''
   ``My background has nothing to do with what this man has said,''
said Parker, who is known professionally as ``Glorious Gloria,''
leading an all-female band.
   ``I travel in good company. He has hurt and crushed me,'' she
said.
   According to Newsday, Parker's lawsuit quotes from the book:
``He made it with three of the musicians who played with Glorious
Gloria Parker and her All-Girl Rumba Orchestra, among them a
Lithuanian trombone player named Gertie whom he made love to
against a wall of flour sacks.''
   ``I never had a trombone player from Lithuania,'' Parker told
Newsday. ``I was never out at three in the morning unless I was
performing and then, I was with my mother and agent. I don't even
know what a daiquiri is.
   Leon Friedman, attorney for Hijuelos and his publisher, Farrar,
Straus &amp; Giroux Inc., which also is named in the suit, told Newsday
the suit is ``totally frivolous'' and ``completely without merit in
law or fact.''
   The lawsuit was filed last month, but Newsday did not say where
or exactly when.
   Hijuelos' novel is about two brothers from Havana who come to
the United States and achieve minor celebrity in an episode of ``I
Love Lucy.''

<HEAD>Washington Mayor Says He's Skipped Some AA Meetings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry said Saturday he has missed
some of the counseling sessions and other meetings that were
prescribed for him as part of his recovery from alcohol and
substance abuse, according to a published report.
   Barry, in an interview in Sunday editions of The Washington
Post, said that until last week he mistakenly believed he could
substitute attendance at church services for the counseling
sessions and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
   The mayor added he would no longer do that.
   Since returning to the District of Columbia last month after
seven weeks of treatment in Florida and South Carolina for
substance abuse, Barry has said he was actively moving toward
recovery by attending counseling sessions three times a week and
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on other days.
   However, Barry told the newspaper that he has missed a number of
those sessions and meetings. ``I've missed several days,
absolutely,'' Barry said, adding later: ``Marion Barry just screwed
up a bit from time to time.''
   The paper said Barry's erratic attendance at counseling sessions
became evident during a Post review of his activities in a recent
seven-day period _ from April 5 to last Thursday.
   Reporters checked Barry's activities from the early morning when
he left his house, through a busy daily schedule of official
business and other appointments, to the evening hours, which
included several media interviews, Next Step counseling meetings
and one late-night dinner with an aide.

<HEAD>Bizarre Details of Coca-Cola Poisoning Case Disclosed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTOW, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A secret torture pit, drug manufacturing
equipment and poison were found in the homes of a man accused of
the 1988 poisoning of his next-door neighbors, leaving one dead and
two paralyzed, authorities said.
   Prosecutors presented the evidence during hearings Friday in
Polk County Circuit Court, where bail was denied for George James
Trepal. He was arrested a week ago on murder, attempted murder and
product-tampering charges.
   Circuit Judge Dennis P. Maloney denied the request for bail,
saying Trepal had motive, opportunity and the peculiar ability to
commit this crime.
   The prosecution believes the evidence will prove Trepal, 41,
spiked bottles of Coca-Cola to kill Peggy Carr and poison her
husband and five others.
   But Trepal's attorney, Jonathan Stidham, said the evidence was
circumstantial, and failed to prove that Trepal, a member of the
Mensa high-IQ club, was involved in illicit activities.
   ``All they're offering here is evidence that my client is a bit
of a different person and that he lived next door,'' Stidham said.
``That isn't enough to convict him and it's certainly not enough to
keep him in jail now.''
   Polk County sheriff's deputies executing search warrants after a
15-month investigation said they found:
   _Thallium nitrate, the obscure chemical used in the Carr
poisoning, in the garage of Trepal's home in Alturas.
   _A homemade journal on poisoning in Trepal's home in Sebring,
where he moved after Mrs. Carr's death, including literature about
thallium nitrate and medical examination procedures.
   _Laboratory equipment at the Sebring home, chemicals and a small
amount of what authorities believe is the illegal drug ``crank.''
   _A secret, soundproof room and equipment for apparent use in
torture and bondage in the basement of the Sebring home.
   Investigator Ernest Mincey said he has detailed several
confrontations between Trepal and the Carr family. Mincey said
investigators believe Trepal may have used the same poison to kill
the Carr family dogs several years ago.
   Peggy Carr, 41, became sick in October 1988 after drinking from
16-ounce soda bottles at her home. She eventually was placed on
life-support equipment and died March 3, 1989.
   Her son, Duane Dubberly, 17, and stepson, Travis Carr, 18, were
left paralyzed. Tests of Mrs. Carr's husband, Parearlyn Carr, and
three other people showed traces of the chemical, but they were not
hospitalized.
   FBI analysis showed the bottles had been laced with thallium
nitrate, a colorless, tasteless chemical that is highly toxic.
   Prosecutors said Trepal is a chemist who had been sentenced to
federal prison in the mid-1970s for helping run a methamphetamine
manufacturing operation in North Carolina.
   Part of the production of methamphetamine, Mincey said, requires
an elaborate chemical process in which thallium nitrate is used.
   Mincey said investigators also determined no member of the Carr
family purchased the soft drink, suggesting that someone familiar
with the family's comings and goings entered the house and left the
bottles when no one was home.
   ``We have evidence that Mr. Trepal often watched the Carr
residence through binoculars,'' Mincey said.
   Friends have said Trepal and his wife, orthopedic specialist
Diana Carr (no relation to the neighboring Carr family), would
stage annual ``mystery murder weekends'' in which the fictional
murders were poison-induced.

<HEAD>Gunman Still Missing, But Suspected Mugger Arrested</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, `The shooter...,' to reflect that police now

<TEXT>
   The subway gunman who fatally shot a mugger two
days ago ignored pleas to surrender on Saturday, but police charged
a 17-year-old with being one of four men who attacked him.
   The gunman's whereabouts remained a mystery as officers
continued searching garbage cans and subway stations for a clue to
his identity.
   The arrested youth, Melvin Kirkland of Brooklyn, was charged
late Friday with second degree robbery and second degree assault in
connection with the subway incident, said Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a
police spokesman.
   Kirkland allegedly was one of four men who attacked the subway
rider Thursday night. The victim retaliated by pulling a gun from
his waist and firing three times, hitting and killing one of the
assailants.
   Vreeland said he had no details on how police tracked down
Kirkland.
   A chrome .25-caliber automatic believed to have been used by one
of the attackers was found by police. The attackers were also armed
with a retractable razor. They were among a group of more than a
dozen men who were smoking marijuana and drinking brandy inside the
subway before the assault.
   After the man was beaten and robbed, he pulled a handgun from
his waistband and fired three shots at his assailants. A
25-year-old man with a half-dozen robbery convictions was fatally
wounded by one of the bullets while six other passengers looked on.
   The shooter walked off the train at the next stop and
disappeared, as did the three surviving muggers. Police on Friday
issued a public appeal for the man to turn himself in, emphasizing
that he was considered a victim.
   ``This is not the Bernhard Goetz case,'' said Brooklyn Chief of
Detectives Joseph DeMartino.
   Goetz received national attention after shooting four youths on
a subway train on Dec. 22, 1984. Police said the shootings were
different because Goetz was not attacked before he fired; the
Thursday night shooter had been assaulted before he pulled a gun.
   One of Goetz's attorneys recommended the gunman keep his
anonymity. Goetz surrendered to police in New Hampshire nine days
after his incident.
   ``If he calls, we'll tell him to sit tight and lay low until and
unless the police determine his name,'' said lawyer Mark Baker.
   A search of trash cans, subway tracks and gutters in downtown
Brooklyn failed to turn up the gunman's wallet, which one witness
told police had been stolen by the assailants, said police
spokesman Sgt. Norris Hollomon.
   The slaying was the ninth this year in the subways; there were
20 in all of 1989.
   The shooter is not the only man still at large after killing a
mugger on a train. The ``Subway Samaritan'' disappeared and was
never identified after fatally stabbing a man who was robbing
another subway rider last Dec. 9.

<HEAD>IG Report of Consulting Contract Awards Finds No Wrongdoing,
Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development's inspector general concluded federal
regulations were not intentionally violated in no-bid contracts
awarded to three former Reagan administration officials, a HUD
spokesman said Saturday.
   ``All I understand is that there was no willful disregard of
federal procurement regulations,'' said Robert Nipp, HUD spokesman.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that
officials, not identified by the newspaper, said the inspector
general determined there may be an appearance of favoritism in the
contract awards and that they should have been awarded through
competitive bidding.
   ``I can't confirm or deny the story,'' said Nipp.
   However, he said, ``The IG's report makes seven or eight
recommendations that this new federal agency should follow in the
future.''
   The investigation concerned nearly $200,000 in consultant
contracts granted by Mary K. Bush, acting director of the Federal
Housing Finance Board, to Wendell Gunn, a former top aide to
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, and two former Treasury Department
officials, Margery Waxman and Kevin Coyne.
   ``We are informed that the audit report does not find any
statutory or regulatory violation in the manner in which these
contracts were let,'' Francis A. Keating, HUD general counsel, told
The Times.
   The White House earlier this month rejected Kemp's nomination of
Ms. Bush, who is not related to President Bush, to head the agency,
which was created as a part of the savings and loan bailout.
   Keating refused to discuss details of the investigative report
with the newspaper, but said ``it puts to rest any suggestion that
inappropriate conduct occurred.''
   Kemp, however, ``is anxious in the future that there not even be
the appearance of inappropriate conduct,'' Keating said.
   Nipp said the report will be made public in two or three days.
   HUD was rocked last year by congressional investigations
uncovering widespread political favoritism in several federal
housing programs.
   A congressional panel also has said it will investigate the
Finance Board matter.

<HEAD>Report: Michael Jackson Gets McCartney-Lennon Publishing Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul McCartney blames Yoko Ono's penny-pinching
ways for a delay that allowed Michael Jackson to buy the publishing
rights to many of the Beatles classics he wrote with John Lennon.
   McCartney says in the May issue of Musician magazine that he
heard the songs were up for sale four years ago. McCartney says he
contacted the songs' owner, British showbiz mogul Sir Lew Grade,
who gave him a price of $20 million.
   He then contacted Ono and suggested each of them put up $10
million to retrieve the rights he and Lennon had signed away years
before, McCartney said.
   ``She said, `I think that's too high a price. I think we can get
'em for five,''' McCartney recalls. ``So it was very difficult.''
   Meanwhile, Jackson bought the catalog.
   Sam Havadtoy, a spokesman for Ono, told the New York Post on
Saturday that the asking price for the catalog was actually $50
million, the price Jackson paid. He said Ono thought the price was
too steep.
   ``Paul and Yoko may have had a phone conversation about the
catalog, at which time she said she wasn't interested, but if
McCartney wanted the publishing rights he could have bought them
himself,'' Havadtoy said.
   ``Yoko does not control Paul McCartney,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: Federal Investigators Agree With Dinkins on Stock Sale
Price</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors have concluded that the
price Mayor David Dinkins set for stock he transferred to his son
was fair and expect to close their probe without filing tax-evasion
charges, a newspaper reported.
   Citing unidentified sources, the Daily News said the office of
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney believes the $58,000 at
which Dinkins valued the stock ``is probably a good ballpark
figure.''
   Maloney declined comment, the News said.
   Dinkins' holdings in the Inner City Broadcasting Corp. and their
value became a major issue during his successful campaign to be
elected mayor.
   Dinkins had said he sold the stock to his son, David Jr., in
1985 to avoid conflicts with his duties on the Board of Estimate.
The board, on which Dinkins sat as Manhattan borough president,
regulates cable television in the city.
   Dinkins produced a handwritten letter in which his son promised
to pay him $58,000 and interest for the stock. David Jr. has until
the end of this year to pay.
   It was later disclosed that in 1983 Dinkins had valued the same
stock at more than $1 million on one financial disclosure form.
   Dinkins said his longtime friend, Inner City President Percy
Sutton, had advised him to use that figure in 1983. Sutton said the
stock would have been worth $1 million had the privately held
company been sold.
   Defending the price he charged his son, Dinkins said Inner City
had bought stock from shareholders at about that price around the
same time.
   The federal investigators agreed, saying other shares were sold
for about the same in 1986, the News said.
   Investigators continue to examine whether Dinkins may have
``parked'' the stock with his son or concocted a fake sale during
the campaign, the News said. FBI tests on the handwritten letter
were unable to pinpoint its age.
   Investigators probably will complete their probe into Dinkins
within a month, the News said.
   A special city investigation is still pending on whether
Dinkins' failure to report the stock sale meant that he violated
financial disclosure laws or an ethics ruling by having voted on
matters affecting Inner City when he was borough president.

<HEAD>Peruvian Congressman Accuses Army of Assassinations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUANCAYO, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A left-wing congressman on Saturday
accused army troops of killing 13 people, including a 4-month-old
infant, and leaving their bodies in shallow graves in the Peruvian
highlands.
   There was no immediate comment from the army or the center-left
government of President Alan Garcia.
   Congressman Alejandro Olivera of the United Left, a Marxist
coalition, said the victims were stabbed and shot and their bodies
left in two shallow graves earlier this month near Pampas, 140
miles east of Lima.
   Olivera said he will make a formal report Monday to Congress.
   International human rights organizations, including Amnesty
International, have strongly criticized Peru's armed forces for
human rights violations in their fight against leftist guerrillas.
The United Nations says Peru leads the world in the number of
disappeared persons.
   The main insurgent group, the Maoist-inspired Shining Path, has
also been widely criticized for human rights abuses during their
10-year fight against Peru's elected governments.
   The government says more than 18,000 people, mostly civilians,
have died since the Shining Path took up arms.
   Olivera said one witness, an 8-year-old girl, said 15 soldiers
broke into her home April 4 in the village of Moya, near Pampas,
and took away her parents, Crisostomo and Estela Chanca, both 56,
and two of their daughters, ages 17 and 12 years.
   The four people were later discovered dead in a nearby grave
with knife and bullet wounds. Five other family members, including
a 4-month-old girl were also found in the same grave.
   Olivera said the bodies of four men from a different family were
found in a grave near Huaynahuano, also near Pampas. He said they
were shot by soldiers on April 8. He said witnesses told him the
soldiers accused the four of encouraging people to boycott the
elections that day.
   The Shining Path had urged people not to vote and had threatened
to kill voters.

   Lithuania's president said his republic will not
bend to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's threat to cut off
crucial supplies if the republic does not back away from its
pro-independence stance.
   Gorbachev's ultimatum Friday was the first step toward a
long-feared economic embargo in Lithuania, which declared its
independence March 11.
   He gave the Baltic republic until Sunday to withdraw its
declaration, saying the Soviets then would stop shipping items they
could export to other countries for hard currency. Such products
include Soviet oil and natural gas, for which Lithuania's 3.8
million residents rely on Moscow.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said his republic
would not back down.

sanctions against the independence movement in Lithuania ``is not
the way to go.''
   Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, meeting on

settle the Baltic dispute through negotiation rather than coercion.
   ``Now is no time for escalation,'' Bush said Friday at a joint

   He said the United States has made it clear to Gorbachev both
publicly and privately that ``coercion, escalation is not the way
to go. The way to go is dialogue.'' And he called on the Soviet

   The White House is hoping a new 10-day visa
that won't require foreigners to reveal their AIDS status will end
threats of a boycott of an upcoming international conference on the
disease in San Francisco.
   But it was unclear whether the action will be enough to satisfy
critics of U.S. immigration restrictions.
   ``I don't know whether they'll view this as sufficient,'' said
June Osborn, chairwoman of the National Commission on AIDS. ``But
it's something we can point to and say `Look, we're trying,' and in
that I think it will be a reassuring signal to the rest of the
world.''
   Members of Congress also said they were encouraged by the
administration's action creating the new visa, announced Friday by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But they also said the
move was only a first step.
