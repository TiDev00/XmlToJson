   The annual human rights report of the State
Department is particularly severe on China, Iraq and Nicaragua,
according to a copies made available Tuesday.
   Among other abuses, the report also recounts floggings in Iran,
amputations in Saudi Arabia and the forced marching of men through
mine fields in Burma.
   The report must be submitted each year to the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. This
year's covers 1989.
   ``The human rights climate in China deteriorated dramatically in
1989,'' the report noted, as troops fired on peaceful demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square. ``At least several hundred, and possibly
thousands'' were killed, and a ``drastic, country-wide crackdown''
on dissent is still in force.
   The report called Iraq's record ``abysmal,'' with ``freedoms of
speech and press and of assembly and association ... virtually
non-existent.''
   ``Other important human rights problems include continuing
disappearances and arbitrary detentions, lack of fair trial,
widespread interference with privacy, excessive use of force
against Kurdish civilians and an almost total lack of worker
rights,'' the department said.
   In Nicaragua, which holds national elections on Sunday, the
Sandinista government maintains ``an extensive and repressive
internal security apparatus.''
   Arbitrary killings are reliably reported both by government
forces and the Contra resistance, the report said. Killings by
government forces in central Nicaragua ``seem designed to cow the
local population,'' it said.
   Both the government and Contra leadership prosecuted troops
accused of murder, the report noted, and men on both sides were
sentenced to prison.
   Among other points:
   _Human rights in territories occupied by Israel, where the Arab
population is in the 27th month of a rebellion, are ``a source of
deep concern.''
   _The Soviet Union has adopted a ``more forthcoming approach'' to
criticism and is improving its human rights record. Yet the
liberalization of the country has seen a sharp increase in
anti-Semitism not fostered by, and even embarrassing to, the
government.
   _Widespread human rights abuses in east Germany ``were being
changed at year's end,'' following the collapse of the hard-line
Communist government.

   The anchorman doesn't look like Peter, Dan or
Tom and doesn't use a TelePrompTer. He looks at the camera and says
something in Russian. ``Welcome, comrades,'' says the translator's
voice-over.
   ``Vremya,'' the Soviet evening news program, has come to U.S.
public television. More than 100 Public Broadcasting Service
stations from New York to Los Angeles are broadcasting ``Vremya''
in a two-week test begun Feb. 12 and coordinated by Boston's WGBH.
   ``Vremya'' _ it means ``time'' in Russian _ has telegenic
anchors, Marina Burtseva and Kira Grigoryeva, but lacks the pinball
graphics and slick, electronic packaging of U.S. network news.
Grigoryeva sits in front of the logo, Burtseva before a shelf of
casually toppled videotape cases. They read from their scripts.
   Glasnost is evident in its workmanlike Soviet's-eye view of the
upheavals of Soviet society in transition, such as the ethnic riots
by ``hooliganist thugs'' in Tadzhikistan and corruption in labor
unions.
   ``It's like a broadcast you might have found in the 1960s,''
said Steven Weinstock, executive producer of ``The Eleventh Hour''
late news show on the New York City PBS station, WNET. His station
broadcasts ``Vremya'' at 1:30 a.m.
   While technically primitive, ``Vremya'' is straightforward in
presenting the news, he said. ``It lacks the entertainment values
that have crept into U.S. news and it lacks the technical wizardry
_ and it's refreshing.''
   ``It also allows an American audience to see the most popular
broadcast in the Soviet Union, to see what is driving Soviet public
opinion, and get a good sense of what is going on,'' he said.
   It has been estimated that 150 million Soviet people watch the 9
p.m. Moscow edition of ``Vremya,'' which would make it the most
popular TV broadcast in the world _ if only the Soviets had A.C.
Nielsen Co.
   In the United States, nine of the nation's top 10 public TV
stations are airing ``Vremya,'' said WGBH news director Alan
Foster. The broadcasters are seeking underwriters for the show,
which Foster estimates would cost $1 million a year.
   Other big-market stations participating include Los Angeles, New
York City, San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, Chicago, Minneapolis,
St. Louis, New Orleans, Dallas and Washington.
   ``There's not a lot in the Deep South and not much of the
Southwest _ although Lubbock, Texas, and Las Cruces, N.M., are
running it,'' Foster said. ``But otherwise the heartland of America
has really taken to it, as has the big city.''
   ``We're very excited about it,'' said Stella Giammasi,
spokeswoman for WNET. She said WNET got the show on short notice
and could schedule it for only 1:30 a.m. If the experiment
succeeds, WNET could put ``Vremya'' in prime time.
   Boston viewers see the show at 4:30 p.m., and Chicago viewers
watch it at 10:30 p.m. It even penetrated commercial TV when the
Philadelphia PBS station opted not to use it and WTGI, an
``international format'' UHF station, grabbed it instead.
   WGBH, which solicits viewer mail at the end of the half-hour
broadcast, by Friday had more than 100 letters from enthusiastic
viewers, Foster said, ``and there's not a single one ... that says
this is Communist propaganda.''
   Turning ``Vremya'' into U.S. TV fare makes for a fast day at
International Video Broadcasts, the Virginia-based company that
captures the early ``Vremya'' from a Soviet satellite each day at
4:30 a.m. EST.
   The signal is altered to U.S. broadcast standards and two IVB
translators _ Soviet emigres trained at top-rated Soviet language
institutes _ translate the videotape.
   ``We have from 7:30 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. to get it all translated,
edited and dubbed,'' said Dick Kuiper, who is in charge of the
production. He recalled one day last week when they finished with
just a minute to spare.
   Television has been Mikhail Gorbachev's ally in perestroika, the
restructuring of Soviet society, Kuiper said.
   ``I think he specifically chose that medium as a powerful tool
to get his message to society, past all the editors and middle
managers,'' he said.
   The ``Vremya'' experiment already is a qualified success, Foster
said. ``I think it will be a success even if it proves that the
show may be a good product without a market,'' he added.
   So far, he said, there's been no word from the underwriters _
corporations and foundations that ultimately would bear most of the
program's cost _ but WGBH is moving to extend the ``Vremya'' test
for two more weeks.

   Ajax Delgado snaps his fingers and
plops his sneaker-clad feet on the table. The laces are electric
green.
   ``Music!'' he exclaims. ``The campaign needed young music!''
   On the wall hangs a glossy poster showing two pairs of naked
thighs pressed together, jeans and a rose crumpled on the floor.
   ``It's beautiful the first time when you do it with love,''
reads the coy slogan.
   Personally, Delgado doesn't like the poster.
   ``The guy's legs are too skinny,'' he says, dismissing it with
another snap of his fingers.
   Who is this fast-talking fellow in the black T-shirt and the
tight jeans eating whipped cream cheese with his fingers?
   A hip advertising executive? A rising record producer?
   Not quite. Delgado, 28, is secretary-general of the Sandinista
Youth, part of the leftist party that has ruled Nicaragua for more
than a decade.
   He is one of the keys to President Daniel Ortega's effort to
beat the United National Opposition, led by Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
   Clearly, things have changed since the days when the Sandinista
Youth motto was a dreary Marxist ``Study, Defend, Produce.''
   The motto is now ``Plug into the Future,'' and the sell is pure
sex.
   The youth vote will be a critical factor in Sunday's general
election. A third of the 1.7 million registered voters are between
the ages of 16 and 25.
   Delgado is a mastermind of the campaign aimed at selling the
Sandinistas as the fun party, the party of the future, the hip
place to be.
   It's a tall job in a country left shabby and tattered by war, a
U.S. embargo and a devastating economic crisis. But Delgado is
convinced the Sandinistas have the youth vote wrapped up.
   Membership in the Sandinista Youth, open to people between the
ages of 15 and 30, has doubled to 50,000 in the past two months, he
says.
   Delgado laughs off the idea that the Sandinistas have
shamelessly adopted one of the crasser advertising concepts of
their capitalist nemesis: sex sells.
   ``It's a Sandinista invention,'' he jokes.
   The poster with the naked legs and the double-entendre message
for first-time voters is just one of a series of posters featuring
amorous couples in the youth-oriented campaign.
   The group has also sponsored beauty contests _ ``The feminists
were critical,'' Delgado admits _ kissing contests, dances, parties
and even a Valentine's Day rally at which a member of the nine-man
Sandinista directorate got married in the ``Forest of Love.''
   Sandinista campaign headquarters bustles with young workers in
brightly colored T-shirts bearing pictures of President Ortega and
other candidates.
   Young people wear Sandinista headbands, Sandinista tank tops and
Sandinista baseball caps. They light up with Sandinista lighters,
tote their books in Sandinista backpacks and tap their toes to
Sandinista tunes in Costeno-style, the reggae music from
Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast.
   The slick campaign is no hit-or-miss affair.
   Delgado says the Sandinista Youth prepared by polling young
people on their likes and dislikes, their worries and hopes.
   The poll even identified the colors they found most appealing,
Delgado says, flourishing an armful of T-shirts in sky blue,
brilliant green, black and gray to demonstrate his point.
   ``Fluorescent colors!'' he exclaims. ``They love fluorescent
colors, too.''
   The study showed that Nicaraguan teen-agers are a lot like
teen-agers everywhere in many ways. They are vain and rebellious;
they are interested in sex and having fun; their heroes and role
models are athletes and musicians.
   Their concerns, however, reflect the troubled reality of this
politically divided and economically crippled nation of 3.5
million: the war, the draft, finding a job, getting a decent
education and figuring out how to have a good time in a country
where the inflation rate was 1,700 percent last year.
   The Sandinista message doesn't dwell on this dreary daily
reality. ``Everything will be better,'' the main campaign slogan
proclaims.
   The Sandinistas have been in power since the 1979 revolution
that toppled the Somoza family dictatorship.
   The 16-year-olds who will be first-time voters Sunday were only
five when the Sandinistas marched triumphantly into Managua.
Ortega, 44, is the only president they have known.
   Without reliable polls, it is impossible to tell if Nicaragua's
young people are buying the party's pitch the way their North
America contemporaries buy the latest sneakers, jeans or recordings.
   ``Everybody in the neighborhood belongs to the Sandinista
Youth,'' said high school student Marta Lorena Mendoza, 18, when
asked why she belonged.
   But it is clear the Sandinista effort to lure the youth vote has
far outstripped that of its main challenger, the United National
Opposition.
   Mrs. Chamorro, UNO's presidential candidate, is a white-haired
and aristocratic widow of 60 whose image contrasts sharply with
that of Ortega.
   There were rumors her campaign would bring in Gloria Estefan and
the Miami Sound Machine, but it didn't happen.
   Before some of her rallies, young women danced to a tropical
beat, but it could not equal the Sandinista brio, and that's not
what UNO is selling anyway.
   A 21-year-old who said he was proud that he served in the
Sandinista army also said he was going to vote for UNO.
   ``It's time for a change,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Ortega has shed his customary fatigues and his deadly
serious, often strident manner for the trappings of celebrity. He
stumps the country in flashy sports shirts, tossing baseballs,
dancing with constituents, and jogging in foot races.
   ``Daniel. President of the Young,'' proclaim the posters and
billboards. ``Daniel is Love.''

   The tall men in cowboy boots and Western hats
stalking shoppers in a Tokyo meat market were Iowa cattlemen
looking for hints on how to remodel their herds to suit Japanese
tastes.
   Across town, a firm called Shop America Ltd. will soon allow
Japanese to order everything from music to appliances from
warehouses in New Jersey.
   Difficult though it may be for foreigners to break into the
Japanese market, Americans see themselves selling tens of millions
of dollars in goods on the strength of bright ideas, quality
products, low prices, thorough preparation and government backing _
like the Japanese have done for years.
   Like Japan, the United States is trying for an economic boost
through exports, and the yen-rich Japanese consumer is the prime
target.
   ``This is a huge market, the second-biggest economy in the
world,'' U.S. Ambassador Michael Armacost said in an interview.
``This is an economy where any company in any field that wants to
be world-class has got to have a foothold.''
   Many U.S. companies are ``doing very well'' in Japan, Armacost
said, but too many still find barriers in local regulations and
business practices that make it difficult to whittle away at the
United States' $50 billion trade deficit with Tokyo.
   On Thursday, U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators resume talks
that aim to change the deep-rooted factors in both nations'
economies that contribute to the U.S. trade deficit.
   These include Japan's high savings rate and lower consumption,
high land prices, complicated distribution system and corporate
linkups that tend to leave outsiders in the cold. At issue on the
U.S. side are low savings rates and higher consumption, low
investment, the budget deficit and quality of the work force.
   The U.S. goal is hoping for more openings to things like Shop
America and U.S. beef. Those pounding at the door include the U.S.
retailer Toys `R' Us, which wants to open big stores in Japan but
is faced with regulations permitting small shops to veto large
stores nearby.
   Solomon Mester, chairman of New York-based Shop America, exults
in the creation of an atmosphere in Japan encouraging sales of U.S.
goods.
   ``They know they have to import more from the United States,''
Mester said. ``They know a backlash is building up, and they have
to level the field.''
   President Vernon Fraenkel set up Shop America with the idea of
getting the Japanese into the U.S. habit of mail-order shopping. It
took more than a year to put together, he said, and a big problem
was finding the right Japanese partner.
   One prospect wanted to stock goods in Japan, but with high land
prices it would have been too expensive.
   Then 7-11 Japan Co. Ltd., which has 4,000 convenience stores,
came into the picture in August. It speedily completed a deal in
December and expects to open for business nationwide in July.
   ``We had a conservative plan to roll it out. Suddenly we've got
a monster with 4,000 heads,''
   The parent company of 7-11 Japan, Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd, is one of
the world's biggest retailers with $12 billion in sales last fiscal
year.
   ``There are whole teams of people working here on this
project,'' Mester said in an interview at Ito-Yokado headquarters.
   Shop America will put a computer terminal in each of 7-11's
stores. Customers use a catalog to order small appliances, recorded
music, perfume, sporting goods, watches, housewares, jewelry and
other items. The bar-coded order flashes over a computer network to
warehouses in New Jersey, and the goods are sent to Japan by mail
or express delivery.
   ``Instead of changing their distribution setup, we're jumping
over it,'' Mester said.
   Fraenkel and Mester said they set a goal of $20 million in sales
the first year, but 7-11 Japan predicts $70 million.
   The Shop America executives disbelieve the old saw that the
Japanese won't buy American goods even if they're cheaper. U.S.
beef is finding ready buyers here at prices sometimes 50 percent
below the cost of Japanese beef.
   Under pressure from Washington, Japan agreed in 1988 to increase
its quota on beef imports gradually until 1991, when the import
limits will be abolished. Tariffs will be in place until 1994.
   ``If we don't attempt to satisfy this market, other parts of the
world will satisfy it,'' said Marshall King, chairman of the Iowa
Cattlemen's Association.
   King, of Boone, Iowa, was one of four Iowa cattlemen and a meat
scientist from Iowa State University who were exploring Japanese
tastes.
   Jim Bradford of Guthrie Center, Iowa, vice chairman of the Iowa
Beef Industry Council, said the information would help cattle
breeders plan the right kind of steer for Japan, a five-year
process.
   The Iowans visited a five-story Seiyu supermarket where posters
with Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's photo beckoned shoppers to try
``Iowa Quality Beef.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 16,000 Utah teachers were told
Monday to prepare for a strike in a dispute with state legislators
centering on salary increases and better benefits.
   Thousands of teachers spent their Presidents Day holiday Monday
at a rally in the Utah Capitol sponsored by the Utah Education
Association.
   ``We are still negotiating,'' association President Jim Campbell
said after a three-hour, closed-door meeting Monday night with
members of his board. ``We are still having teachers stay on a
strike alert but we will not call a strike tomorrow morning.''
   Teachers were told by officials of the union to report as usual
to classrooms Tuesday. Campbell would not comment further.
   State lawmakers, following recommendations in Republican Gov.
Norm Bangerter's $1.1 billion education budget, pumped $12 million
into textbooks and offered to enable local school districts to
impose higher property taxes to help relieve classroom overcrowding.
   They also promised to dedicate the lion's share of a $150
million 1989-90 budget surplus to education, but remained steadfast
in offering educators only a 6 percent salary increase, the same as
other public employees, and balked at dipping into Utah's $48
million ``rainy day'' fund or repealing a tax cut imposed last
September.
   The nearly 16,000 members of the education association voted
3-to-1 Friday to reject the proposed raise. They also authorized
the education association's 16-member board to call a strike if
their demands are not met by the time the Republican-controlled
Legislature adjourns its regular session at midnight Wednesday.
   Teachers want the Legislature to increase the amount it
appropriates for education, but have not demanded a specific amount.
   Utah House Speaker Nolan Karras, who has been involved in
negotiations, spoke briefly with Campbell on Monday and said House
Republicans will consider the situation in caucus Tuesday morning.
   A strike could affect up to 420,000 students and Utah's 20,000
teachers.
   Teachers point to their average salary of about $25,000, which
ranks 41st in the nation. They contend Utah has the largest class
sizes in the country and spends the least per student.
   The education association called a statewide, one-day strike in
September after the Legislature approved a $35 million tax cut but
no new money for education.

<HEAD>Yuppie Pool Hall: Beer Nuts Out, Gazpacho In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This can't really be the old-fashioned
neighborhood pool hall that mothers warned their sons to stay out
of.
   There, at the bottom of the menu, is the polite admonition:
``Shootz Cafe is a smoke-free environment. Thank you for not
smoking.''
   Minnesota Fats could shed a few pounds at the Shootz, a yuppie
bistro and billiards lounge where the customers chalk their cues
over California wine spritzers, or chow down on gazpacho and a
heaping antipasto of imported cheeses, prosciutto, sun-dried
tomatoes and artichoke hearts.
   ``This is a clean, upscale billiards hall _ no smoke, no
drunks,'' says co-owner Ric Adamcik. ``It's where mothers can tell
their sons and daughters to go and have a good time. In fact, you
can bring your mother along.''
   A former Army brat, Adamcik remembers sneaking into pool halls
outside the gates of military bases for a forbidden peek at the
pine-paneled, male-only world where players sucked on longneck Buds
and jostled with hustlers and bookies over the seductive click and
thump of billiard balls on green baize.
   It was the kind of place where a guy could scratch, spit and
talk dirty all night long, without a nagging whine from the missus.
   ``I remember that I didn't want to play in a place that smelled
like that,'' Adamcik said. ``It stank of stale beer and cigarettes.
It was so smoky it made my eyes burn. It was full of guys with
packs of Camels rolled up their sleeves and `Momma' tattoos on
their arms.''
   The cue racks at the Shootz Cafe hang on raspberry walls. The
high-tech stereo system blasts New Wave music. Earnest young
professionals in starched button-downs, power ties and wide
suspenders bend over 14 top-of-the-line Brunswick tables of oak and
brass.
   For that ``homey feel,'' Adamcik says, players awaiting their
turn can relax on leather sofas around a roaring fireplace.
   Billiards industry officials say the old-time pool halls are
dying out. They have fallen victim to soaring rents, local
anti-vice ordinances and state-run lotteries that have lured
customers away from poolrooms that frequently served as fronts for
illicit gambling enterprises.
   More important, the growing affluence of Americans has produced
a dramatic change in the way they spend their leisure time, says
Mark Cord, executive vice president of the Billiard Congress of
America, the industry's trade association.
   ``People don't want to spend the evening alone in a dingy place
where there's a lot of drinking and gambling,'' Cord said.
``Families are staying home or going out and doing things together.
Smart business owners are making money by appealing to the family
trade at a respectable place.''
   Cord says an estimated 35 million Americans are playing
billiards regularly, a 430 percent boost since the mid-1950s. That
makes it the second most popular family sports activity in the
United States after bowling, he says.
   The yuppie elegance of the Shootz Cafe is applauded by such
billiards greats as Willie Mosconi and Minnesota Fats, who fondly
remember the fabulous era of chandeliered salons in New York,
Chicago, Detroit and other cities in the 1920s, before poolrooms
turned into gambling dens during the Great Depression.
   Mosconi, 76, who lives quietly in suburban Philadelphia, won 15
world billiards titles before he retired from tournament play nine
years ago.
   Minnesota Fats, whose real name is Rudolph Wanderone and was
portrayed in the movie, ``The Hustler,'' by the late Jackie
Gleason, is over 90, still fat and still shooting pool.
   ``I can beat anybody on Earth,'' Wanderone said in a telephone
interview from the Nashville, Tenn., hotel where he lives.
   Tipping the scales at 200 pounds, Wanderone says his appetite
knows no bound, not even gazpacho and artichoke hearts.
   ``I'm not a picky eater,'' he said. ``I'll eat anything that
don't bite me first.''

<HEAD>Government to Politburo: No More Plush Palaces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new
perestroika-without-perks policy is opening up a harsh new world
for Politburo members, who now will have to do without their plush
country homes, or dachas.
   The government has decided that the country's current and former
leaders _ except Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov _ are no
longer entitled to privileges such as the dachas, and they've been
ordered to move out.
   Valery A. Sidorov, an aide to the chairman of the Soviet
legislature's Commission on Privileges, told The Associated Press
Monday that the dachas have become a ``mass insult'' and their
occupants will just have to get used to a ``normal lifestyle.''
   Where once the Soviet high and mighty played and sipped vodka,
children will roam. Sidorov said the country homes are being turned
over to the Soviet Health Ministry for use as rest homes and
kindergartens.
   As if losing the dachas wasn't enough of a blow, retired members
of the Communist Party's long-ruling Politburo will also have to do
without the three household workers and black Volga cars the
government has been providing them virtually free of charge,
Sidorov said.
   They also will lose the right to order food from special
government stocks.
   The changes are part of a general attack on the perks of the
Soviet elite that, under public pressure, Gorbachev reluctantly
agreed to endorse only last year.
   In a country where shortages of housing, food and consumer goods
are a major source of discontent, the network of special stores,
private airports, sleek black limousines, fancy homes and
high-quality medical care for the government and party elite have
generated massive public fury.
   Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin built an entire
parliamentary election campaign on the issue last year, and became
wildly popular because of it.
   More radical anti-perks movements have swept through Eastern
European countries like East Germany and Bulgaria, where ousted
Communist leaders face prosecution for abuses of power that
included extravagent living.
   In the Soviet Union, regional Communist bosses have recently
lost jobs after being caught amassing luxury goods not available to
the masses.
   Most of the Soviet leadership's dachas _ some are believed to
feature tennis courts and private swimming pools and fountains _
are on the outskirts of Moscow and shrouded in secrecy.
   They are surrounded by fences and guards and traffic police stop
anyone venturing close to the secluded ``dacha rows.''
   In a reflection of the secrecy, Sidorov said in a telephone
interview he did not know how many dachas are affected, and he
declined to provide a complete list of who would have to move out.
   He said, however, that his boss, privileges commission chairman
Yevgeny M. Primakov, and Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev are
the only people on the current 19-person Politburo who do not have
government dachas.
   Primakov's record, however, is not untarnished. A newspaper
reported Saturday that a special plane arranged for him at one of
Moscow's VIPs-only airports held up dozens of other flights at
other airports so the sky could be kept clear for security.
   Several former Politburo members _ many of them in their 90s _
are believed to live in fancy dachas, including holdovers from the
Leonid I. Brezhnev era such as Geidar Aliev, Boris Ponomarev and
Peter Shelest.
   Sidorov said many of the former Politburo members, especially
Ponomarev, are not giving up their perks without a fight. He said
Ponomarev had sent a protest letter to the Commission on Privileges.
   No deadline for the evictions was set, Sidorov said.
   Former residents of the dachas will be offered comparatively
meager luxuries in return for moving out. They will be allowed to
rent _ at their own expense _ country homes run by government
agencies for a few days a month as well as a government car from a
fleet for up to 20 hours a month, Sidorov said.
   If they want their own dachas, he said, they will have to build
them themselves.

   Barbara Bush said the listlessness
of her dog Millie is due more to jealousy than illness.
   ``George is convinced she's sick, but it really is because she's
jealous of her son,'' a big, bounding dog who belongs to one of
Bush's sons and frequently visits the White House, Mrs. Bush said
Monday during a visit to the village center 1{ miles from the Bush
family compound.
   ``It's more in the mind than the body,'' she said as local
children petted the dog.
   Later, Mrs. Bush chatted with reporters aboard Air Force One on
the trip back to Washington.
   On the president's suggestion the day before that he might
invite Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to their Maine home, Mrs.
Bush said that Bush had not told her about it.
   But, she added, `You know me. Anybody he asks _ I'll be nice

   Voters just couldn't say no to Shintaro Ishihara,
whose nationalist views expressed in the book ``The Japan That Can
Say No'' have created a stir in the United States.
   The flambouyant and outspoken Ishihara, 57, was elected for the
seventh time to represent his metropolitan Tokyo district in the
lower house of Parliament. He was backed by the governing Liberal
Democratic Party.
   Ishihara's 32-year-old son, Nobuteru, also won a lower house
seat in Sunday's elections.
   The Ishiharas are the first father-and-son team to win seats in
the powerful chamber in the same election, Japan's Kyodo News
Service reported.
   In the book he co-authored with Akio Morita, chairman of Sony
Corp., the elder Ishihara wrote that Japan has been too passive in
its relations with the United States and argued that Tokyo must
stand up and say no to unrealistic U.S. demands on military and
trade issues.
   The book, a best seller in Japan, also accuses Americans of
racial arrogance, which Ishihara says has created an inferiority
complex among the Japanese, making them too willing to give in to
Washington.

   Britain's Prince Charles put down
his polo mallet for a film role as he continued his efforts for
wildlife conservation during a visit to Florida.
   Charles made an animal conservation film for the British
Broadcasting Corp. during a three-hour visit Monday to the Kennedy
Space Center.
   Filming took place at a national wildlife refuge, part of the
88,000-acre space center and home to eagles and hundreds of other
bird species, alligators, wild pigs, deer and other wildlife.
   Forrest McCartney, space center director, also escorted Charles
on a tour of the shuttle launch control center and an assembly
building. The group saw from a distance the launch pad where the
shuttle Atlantis is being readied for liftoff Thursday.
   During the three days preceding his visit to the cape, the heir
to the British throne was in Vero Beach, where he participated in
two polo matches to benefit a wildlife protection organization.
   Charles is scheduled to attend a conference on international
business beginning today in Charleston, S.C., and to travel to
Washington later this week to meet with President Bush and British
Embassy officials.

   Jamie Berzas, a Grammy nominee for best
traditional folk recording, also is a full-time mechanic in the
heart of central Louisiana's Cajun prairie land.
   Jamie Berzas and Cajun Tradition, a band formed 11 years ago,
were nominated for their 1988 release, A La Veille Facon (In the
Old Fashioned Way).
   Berzas said the nomination holds special significance for
part-time musicians.
   ``It probably means a once-in-a-lifetime shot at it. It will
probably be one of the biggest events in our lives,'' said Berzas,
the lead singer and accordion player.
   Berzas works 10-hour days at Berzas' Auto Service in the shadow
of the water tower in Mamou, a town of 3,000.
   Madeline Berzas, Jamie's wife and the band's drummer, and Mark
Young, the lead guitarist and the band's co-founder, also work at
the repair shop.
   The community of Mamou has rallied with bake sales and benefits
for its honorees to help them pay for the trip to Los Angeles on
Tuesday. The Grammys will be awarded Wednesday.
   ``We weren't nominated just for our work. We think we were
nominated because of our part in trying to keep the tradition,''
Berzas said.
   ``When this album was nominated, all of traditional Cajun music
was nominated in our eyes.''

<HEAD>Natural Risks Said to Outweigh Man-Made Dangers in Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Nature's own cancer-causing chemicals that
are an unavoidable part of everything from pot roast to peanuts
represent a greater health danger than pesticides and other
pollutants, a health official warns.
   A new estimate by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
concludes that more than 98 percent of the cancer risk in the diet
results from ordinary foods _ not from additives, poisons or other
man-made contributions to the food chain.
   ``The risk is from natural carcinogens in the diet because they
overwhelm all the others,'' said Dr. Robert J. Scheuplein, director
of the Office of Toxicological Sciences at the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   This does not mean that all food is dangerous or even that
people can do much about the hazard. Instead, Scheuplein's analysis
was intended to focus attention away from what he sees as a largely
bogus health issue _ the hazards of chemical contamination.
   Dr. Frank Young, a former FDA commissioner who now is deputy
assistant secretary of health and human services, agreed.
   ``The headline should not be, `All Foods Cause Cancer' or `Drop
Dead. Don't Eat,''' Young said. ``The good news is, let us not as a
nation focus just on the technological food additives. We ought to
focus on the big issues as well.''
   Instead of worrying about the vanishingly small risk of Alar in
apples or dioxin in milk, Scheuplein said food scientists should be
exploring ways to remove the important toxins in ordinary foods.
   ``Even a modestly effective attempt to lessen the dietary risk
of natural carcinogens would probably be enormously more useful to
human health than regulatory efforts devoted to eliminating traces
of pesticide residues or other specific trace-level chemicals,''
Scheuplein said.
   He presented his findings Monday at a meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Scheuplein based his conclusions on a statistical analysis of
the quantity of cancer-causing toxins found in various parts of the
diet.
   He said that the risk of dying from cancer from dietary exposure
to all kinds of carcinogens, or cancer-inducing substances, was 7.7
percent. The risk from traditional foods alone was 7.6 percent.
   ``Most of the risks are people's personal choices,'' Scheuplein
said. ``They are not imposed on people by corporations. Apparently
that's a hard lesson. People want to blame somebody.''
   The clearest cancer-causing agent in ordinary food, he said, is
fat, which has been linked with several kinds of tumors. However,
most foods now eaten would not pass safety tests required for new
food chemicals and additives.
   He estimated that carcinogens make up one-tenth of 1 percent of
the food people eat. Among concerns he cited were:
   _Well-cooked, high-protein foods, such as meat and eggs, contain
bacterial substances that can cause genetic mutations. An ordinary
day's protein can be as damaging to the genes as five cigarettes.
   _Hazardous urethane is a natural product of fermentation. It is
present in beer, yogurt, bread and other foods.
   _Mycotoxins produced by molds are common in many foods,
especially when stored in warm, humid conditions. Aflatoxins occur
in corn and peanuts, zearalenone in soybeans and luteoskyrin in
yellow rice.
   _Smoked or salted fish and pickled vegetables may cause
digestive cancers. This is attributed to nitrates and funguses.
   _Grilling and charring fish or meat can produce potentially
hazardous substances, such as nitropyrenes.
   _Many spices contain questionable substances. There is estragole
in tarragon, eugenal in cloves, cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon,
myristicin in nutmeg and anethole in fennel. Several spices,
including oregano, majoram and bay leaves, may cause genetic damage.
   _Other naturally occurring carcinogens include d-limonene in
oranges, psoralens in celery, hydrazines in mushroons and nitrates
in spinach.

<HEAD>Some Farmers Overpaid Through Drought Aid Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 80 farming operations were paid more
than the limit of $100,000 set by Congress under 1988 drought aid
legislation, according to Agriculture Department records.
   The payment list of top recipients under the Disaster Assistance
Act of 1988 was compiled by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Congress provided $3.9 billion in aid, mostly to help with crop
losses suffered in the 1988 drought. As of Dec. 31, payments of
more than $3.88 billion had been made to 805,152 recipients.
   Agency officials said the list of top payments was sent to the
Office of Management and Budget, which has been reviewing large
payments to farmers under various commodity and emergency programs.
A copy was made available to The Associated Press.
   ``We're asking for our money back, if we've overpaid anybody,''
said Daniel F. Shaw, ASCS deputy administrator for state and county
operations. ``The computers are set to flag anybody that goes over
the $100,000 limit, even by a dollar.''
   Agency rules are flexible when it comes to some kinds of farm
operations, however, including joint ventures and family
partnerships.
   Shaw was asked about the biggest payment on the 1988 list,
$380,092 to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Minnesota.
   ``They're a joint venture, so they didn't go over the $100,000
limit,'' he said. ``That's for an Indian tribe, and an Indian tribe
is a joint venture, so every Indian in that tribe is entitled to
the $100,000 limit. It's almost impossible for an Indian tribe to
violate.''
   Another leeway is provided in a family partnership, which
``could be made up of four people in a family,'' Shaw said. ``Each
one is eligible for $100,000.''
   But the ASCS computer operation in Kansas City, Mo., tracks
other possible violations, including identical or similar
addresses, particularly if used by different individuals.
   ``Single names bother me,'' Shaw said. ``They should come up
flagged, and we'll be asking for our money back if there's a
violation.''
   If all other conditions are met properly, the agency is likely
to ask only for the amount in excess of the $100,000 limit. In some
cases, however, the farmer might have to return the entire amount.
   Not all blame can be put on the farmer if a payment is out of
line. Agency officials admit mistakes are made in administering the
program and some overpayments can be the result of USDA errors. But
that's one reason for checking out the payments.
   The agency stepped up its review of drought payments after a
series of Associated Press stories in December showed widespread
misapplication of funds in the $3.9 billion 1988 relief program.
   Last month the ASCS said it was checking specific misdeeds
spotted by the AP in its seven-month study of drought payments in
22 counties in eight states.
   The issue of large subsidies to farmers under the USDA's annual
commodity programs and the drought payments is part of a developing
controversy in Congress over federal crop insurance and disaster
payments.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says it's too expensive to
have both and Congress will have to choose between an overhaul of
federal crop insurance or abandoning it in favor of permanent
disaster aid.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, who defends the drought aid program because
of its emergency nature, said last week that the Bush
administration is ``forcing our hand'' into enacting reforms.
   About half of the top 80 payment recipients exceeded the
$100,000 limit by less than $100 each, according to the list
provided to the AP. Overall, the 80 recipients were concentrated in
Montana, 15; Michigan, 9; South Dakota, 9; Illinois, 8; Texas, 6;
and Wisconsin, 6.
   In addition to those getting more than $100,000 in payments, the
list included more than 600 others who received exactly $100,000
under the 1988 drought program.

<DATELINE>LOS CHINAMOS, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People may not recognize the
faces, but the names of the two former Contras are part of the
mythology of the mountains.
   ``Which one is Dumas?'' a woman asks in the bustle of Sunday
market. ``Which one is Rigoberto?''
   This is Contra country. Many families have collaborated with the
U.S.-backed rebel force, losing sons, husbands, brothers,
sweethearts to Nicaragua's fratricidal war.
   Rigoberto (Tirzo Moreno), Dumas (Cesar Chavarria), Fernando
(Diogenes Hernandez) and Licenciado (Victor Sanchez) led those men
into battle until they were ousted from the Contras in May 1988.
   Now they are back, trying to persuade rebel fighters to lay down
their arms, helping the leftist Sandinista government make its case
for demobilization, arguing that next Sunday's elections mean there
is no longer any need for the Contras to fight.
   Chontales province is a rugged cattle region and these wary men
and women of Los Chinamos in their boots and cowboy hats and spurs
are a tough audience.
   The pouring rain turns into a drizzle. The road melts into a
slippery ribbon of red mud. Still, people gather when the former
comandantes climb onto the back of a truck in the middle of town.
   Some residents are confounded by the sight of the former Contras
swooping in aboard a Sandinista air force helicopter, then standing
side by side with government soldiers.
   ``Why aren't they in Honduras?'' one man mutters as he moves
under an eave to escape the chilly, mistlike rain. ``How did they
get here?''
   Rigoberto, Fernando, Licenciado and Dumas have been living in
the United States since being forced out in one of the more
notorious internal battles that have bedeviled the Contras.
   They were deported from Honduras, where the rebels are based,
after telling the CIA they believed then-chief of staff Enrique
Bermudez was corrupt, and demanding a change. The next thing they
knew, they were on a plane to Miami.
   All four deny any Sandinista government role in their return to
Nicaragua. They say they came back on the eve of general elections
because they believe Nicaragua is finally moving toward democracy.
   In the government's eagerness to see the Contras disbanded, the
Sandinistas advanced the elections nine months and opened the
political process.
   Most of the opposition has united behind publisher Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro's challenge to President Daniel Ortega in
Sunday's elections.
   Despite the new political openness, however, few Contra fighters
have come down from the mountains. The only active-duty comandante
to lay down his arms, Luis Adan Fley, says the four are letting
themselves be used by the Sandinistas. Fley has returned for the
elections, but refuses to have anything to do with his former
comrades.
   The Sandinista expedition included Santiago Murey and Franco
Vicente of the United Nations-Organization of American States
commission to demobilize the Contras.
   The trip to Los Chinamos, 100 miles east of Managua, is their
first foray into the countryside.
   ``Trial by fire,'' Murey says, as he climbs onto the truck bed.
   He and Vicente tell the crowd that Contras who demobilize will
not face sanctions or harassment. Standing in drenched shirts, they
invite questions.
   No one speaks up.
   Then Rigoberto steps forward, ignoring a loudspeaker as he looks
down on a sea of impassive peasant faces.
   ``We're here so young men won't keep dying in this land of lakes
and volcanos,'' he says. ``The time has come to put an end to this
war.''
   He insists that the elections represent real change, a big step
on the road to democracy, on the road to the cause for which they
fought so long.
   ``There is no justification for staying in the mountains,''
Rigoberto says.
   A man steps forward and asks what the four former comandantes
can do to end the war since they no longer have contact with the
Contras.
   ``We're going to make contact here,'' Rigoberto replies. ``They
should negotiate their own fate, their own life, without an
intermediary.''
   Later, they work the crowd like politicians, grabbing arms,
shaking hands, slapping backs, threading their way among mules
laden with cheeses.
   Rigoberto and his companions then clamber up a steep, muddy
hillside. They set up a radio, stringing an antenna to the tallest
tree.
   They roam the frequencies, calling out to former comrades in
arms as 10 Sandinista soldiers look on.
   Rigoberto makes contact.
   ``We're not here to surrender anyone,'' he says. ``We were in
the mountains for seven years. We're here looking for a solution.'
   The radio crackles back.
   ``I know you, Rigoberto,'' a voice says.
   A wave of static washes out his next words, then the voice comes
through loud and clear.
   ``We don't want anyone here who sells out his homeland. We want
men here with convictions and guts, you dogs.''

<TEXT>
   Authorities hunting for clues in two grocery
store bombings said Monday they hoped for help from a
security-camera videotape of people entering and leaving one of the
stores.
   ``We have no leads at all,'' said Police Chief Jerry King. ``At
this point we have no motive.''
   The Saturday bombings spurred copycat bomb threats Monday,
including one that prompted the evacuation of North Fulton Regional
Hospital in Roswell around 9:35 p.m., said police dispatcher
Charles Tyson. No bombs had been found by late in the evening.
   The bombs at a Kroger and a Cub Foods store in this wealthy
suburb about 20 miles north of Atlanta misfired. No one was injured
and only minor damage was done.
   Both stores had been warned about the bombs by an anonymous
caller. The Kroger store was evacuated, but about 100 shoppers in
the Cub Foods store ignored the warning and were shopping when the
bomb detonated.
   The videotape was made at the Kroger store as a matter of
routine because a bank is inside the store, King said. He said
investigators would review the tape for any suspicious-looking
people.
   The two bombs were basically identical, King said.
   ``It was not a pipe bomb. It wasn't anything that
sophisticated,'' he said.
   The detonators fired, but did not trigger large explosions, FBI
spokesman Pat Johnson said.
   FBI and federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents
met Monday with police to discuss the case. ATF spokesman Tom
Stokes said officials could release no further information.
   Stokes said Sunday the devices apparently were not built by
whoever made powerful bombs that killed a federal judge in Alabama
and a lawyer in Georgia in December.
   Investigators have found absolutely no connection between the
grocery bombings and the nail-filled mail bombs that killed Judge
Robert Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Mountain
Brook, Ala., and attorney Robert Robinson of Savannah, Ga., Stokes
said.
   
   But Fulton County Youth Investigator Steve Rose said federal
investigators would receive information on a 16-year-old Sandy
Springs youth who purchased materials to make a bomb three days
before the explosions.
   ``We'll pass what we have along to them and let them decide what
they want to do about it,'' he said.
   Police said they have no evidence that would indicate that the
youth was connected to Saturday's bombs.
   Rose said a sales clerk at C and C Hardware Co. told police the
teen-ager purchased copper pipe, end caps and two boxes of kitchen
matches Wednesday at the store.
   The youth also asked the sales clerk where he could buy aluminum
pipe and wood alcohol and said he planned to make a bomb, Rose said.
   Rose said the sales clerk got the license number of the car the
boy was driving and gave it to police.

   Usually, it's a little difficult to feel
sympathetic with Manon in the second act of ``Manon Lescaut.''
   After leaving her student lover, she lives luxuriously in Paris
with the elderly Geronte. Even when Geronte finds out he's been
two-timed and sends for the police, she delays flight to gather up
her jewels.
   But Mirella Freni sang Manon with such depth of emotion, such
phrasing and nuance, such exquisitely held notes, that one melts
before her singing Puccini's beautiful melodies about true love.
   The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, conducted by Nello Santi,
sounded wonderful in the first ``Manon Lescaut'' of the season. The
opera was last heard at the Met in the 1986-87 season. This
production is by Desmond Heeley.
   Tenor Peter Dvorsky of Czechoslovakia sang the young lover, Des
Grieux. In Act 1, he was without subtlety, blaring from soft to
loud. Later, Dvorsky sounded much better. His tone didn't become
magnificent but it became more of one piece.
   J. Patrick Raftery _ who has sung at the Paris Opera and Lyric
Opera of Chicago, among other places _ was making his Met debut as
Manon's brother. He wasn't projecting in Act 1 and he also was
better later in the opera. His is the kind of baritone voice that
remains focused, never spreading all over the tones.
   Act 1 in general looked and sounded underrehearsed.
   Italo Tajo was very good as the elderly Geronte. In Act 1,
though he sounded appropriately aged, his singing came through the
best of the male principals.

   A shotgun-waving young man who was killed by police
after he stalked through a shopping mall was identified Monday as a
brother of late reggae music star Bob Marley.
   Police said they hadn't been able to explain the actions of
Anthony Booker, 19.
   ``The investigation's still going on. We don't have many
details,'' said Metro-Dade Police Lt. Glen Kay.
   Police were called to busy Cutler Ridge Mall around 3:30 p.m.
Sunday after customers saw a tall, thin young man dressed in white
and carrying a pistol-gripped .12-gauge shotgun. The man was
railing incoherently and mumbling to himself, witnesses told police.
   ``He was really mad. He was looking for someone,'' said shopper
Carol Williams, who said she was shopping with her two small
children when Booker pointed the shotgun at her, then continued on
his way.
   ``He was saying: `I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you,''' she
said.
   Shoppers scattered as the gunman walked through the mall until
police arrived.
   As an off-duty Miami police officer chased him, a police
helicopter hovered overhead and Metro-Dade police moved in, the
gunman ran through the mall parking lot, police said.
   He fired at least once. Officers returned fire, killing him,
police said.
   Booker's mother, Cedella Booker, said she didn't know what
caused her son to go to the mall with a gun.
   ``He is just a ... humble young man. When I saw him yesterday,
he didn't look like my son,'' she said.
   Friends and relatives said he had seemed upset since returning
last week from a trip to his homeland of Jamaica. They said he
hadn't been in trouble before and aspired to be a musician.
   Bob Marley, who brought the reggae music of Jamaica to
international prominence, died in Miami of a brain tumor in 1981.

   Efforts to predict the effects of global
warming are being hurt by lack of access to 40 years of secret
Soviet and U.S. military data on the north polar ice cap,
scientists said.
   Submarine sonar measurements of the thickness of the ice cap are
crucial to understanding ocean currents underneath the ice cap,
said Michael Schlesinger of Oregon State University.
   Those currents must be understood if researchers are to predict
accurately the rate of warming of the earth's climate as carbon
dioxide is released into the atmosphere, Schlesinger said Monday at
the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science.
   ``What I want is, month by month, the thickness of sea ice _
which you can only get by submarine,'' Schlesinger said.
   Soviet military planners have the same data on the north polar
ice cap that American military officials have, Schlesinger said.
But his Soviet colleagues have told him they cannot get the secret
data.
   Satellite measurements of the monthly changes in the size of the
ice cap are available, but the satellites cannot be used to measure
the ice's thickness, he said.
   Schlesinger is one of a small number of researchers developing
computer programs to simulate the effect of global warming and
predict its future consequences.
   Such models need data on ocean currents to make accurate
predictions, he said. There are five such models in the United
States, and the same number in the Soviet Union, he said.
   ``All the models have run with some assumption of this missing
term under the ice,'' he said.
   Syukuro Manabe, another developer of such models, said the ocean
can absorb a lot of the heat produced as increasing amounts of
carbon dioxide in the air trap more and more of the sun's heat.
   Researchers said they do not yet know exactly how much heat the
oceans can absorb.
   The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to
double by the first half of the next century, but the associated
warming will probably lag by several decades because at first the
heat will be lost into the oceans, said Manabe, a researcher at a
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration laboratory at
Princeton University in New Jersey.
   The eventual temperature rise is expected to be an average of 2
degrees to 4 degrees around the world, the researchers said.
   Manabe hopes the abatement of the Cold War will help
global-warming researchers.
   ``I'm hoping that this will be one of the peace dividends,'' he
said, ``that the U.S. and the Soviets will exchange sea ice data.''

Peaceful Election</HEAD>

   The Sandinista government says nine
people were killed in clashes with Contra rebels over the past
week, but international observers are noting a lull in political
violence as general elections near.
   The foreigners say they expect Sunday's potentially pivotal
balloting to be peaceful, free and fair.
   ``Over the last two weeks we had been rather worried about
possible violence,'' Iqbal Riza of Pakistan, local head of the
United Nations mission to observe the elections, said Monday.
   ``Over the last few days the tone has been lowered,'' he said,
``and we are noticing a willingness by each party to avoid
violence.''
   Tension had shot up over the past two weeks as the leftist
Sandinistas and their main challenger, the U.S.-backed United
National Opposition coalition, exchanged threats of violence.
   President Daniel Ortega, seeking another six-year term,
threatened to close the newspaper published by coalition
presidential candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and confiscate
her house if the Sandinistas win.
   He also threatened to seize the home of its vice presidential
candidate, Virgilio Godoy.
   Godoy had threatened to ``make the Sandinistas pay the bill'' _
an ominous Nicaraguan expression that can imply anything, including
death.
   Both threats came in campaign speeches, but both sides have
since toned down their rhetoric.
   As Riza was speaking at a news conference at the foreign
correspondents' club in Managua, the Defense Ministry issued a
communique on the clashes with the U.S.-backed Contras.
   Th one-page statement said Sandinista troops fought Contras in
Chontales province in the south on Wednesday and Friday and in
Nueva Segovia province in the north on Sunday.
   It said five rebels died in the clashes. It did not report any
army casualties.
   The Defense Ministry also accused the Contras of ambushing and
killing four peasants in the northern province of Jinotega on week
ago and of kidnapping a civilian in the South Atlantic Autonomous
Region on Sunday. It said one of the peasants killed in Jinotega
was a Sandinista Front militant.
   The four Jinotega victims were buried Monday in the town of
Esteli.
   The Sandinistas have repeatedly accused the Contras of
intimidating and killing Sandinista supporters in the countryside.
The Contras have denied it.
   Figures obtained by The Associated Press show Managua, the
capital and one of the big question marks in the election,
represents the largest single chunk of registered voters nationwide.
   A final tally of voters registered in Nicaragua's nine regions
show Managua has 462,446 registered voters, out of a national total
of 1,750,550, or 26.42 percent of the vote.
   Many public employees and members of the armed forces live in
Managua, an advantage for the Sandinistas in the voting.
   But the urban poor _ and Managua is by far the largest urban
center in Nicaragua _ have suffered the most from a ravaged economy
that the opposition blames on Sandinista mismanagement and the
Sandinistas blame on the U.S. economic embargo in effect since 1985
and years of war with the Contras.
   The rebels began fighting the Sandinista government in 1981, two
years after the revolution that toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza.
   In February 1988, the U.S. Congress cut off military aid to the
Contras, who are based in neighboring Honduras.
   President Bush has said he wanted non-lethal aid to continue to
the Contras to ensure that the Sandinistas hold free elections.

<HEAD>Farm Groups Wary About Administration Farm Bill Contrariness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Farm organizations are skeptical about the
Bush administration's refusal to spell out precisely what it wants
in new farm legislation regarding price supports and target prices.
   Some members of Congress aren't pleased about the foot-dragging,
either. At a hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee on Feb. 7,
Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., challenged Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter.
   ``We can't write a farm bill without an idea of what the
administration wants,'' Leahy said. ``I want specifics.''
   But Yeutter continued to stonewall: ``The administration will
not declare today what its position is on target prices.'' He added
that talks on spending ought to take place in private rather than
in a public hearing.
   Yeutter had another opportunity to provide more details at a
hearing today before the House Agriculture Committee and Chairman
Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, but there wasn't much expectation he
would get into more specifics than he did with Leahy.
   Meanwhile, the administration's fuzziness about target prices _
rates upon which crop ``deficiency'' payments to farmers are based
_ has prompted doubting stares and a few fiery glances from farm
groups.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation, which has been relatively
placid about administration policies, says it isn't satisfied by
the Bush farm bill proposals so far.
   ``Failure to address target price levels is the largest question
mark that we have in our minds,'' said federation policy specialist
Rob Nooter. ``That's going to be a very important element of
putting together a new farm bill _ how much income support do we
include?''
   The federation favors freezing target prices at their 1990
levels, but without an answer from the administration, ``it's
obvious that Congress is going to have to make that decision in
negotiations'' with the Bush people, Nooter said.
   At the heart of the Bush plan is ``flexibility'' so farmers can
have more choice as to what crops to plant under annual commodity
programs. The basic idea appears to have strong acceptance among
some farm groups, although it's not unanimous.
   The National Grange said the 1990 farm bill proposals announced
by Yeutter on Feb. 6 would, as expected, lead to policies the
administration believes will be ``more oriented to market signals''
instead of government regulation.
   ``Notably absent from the proposals are specific recommendations
for target prices for the government's crop programs,'' the Grange
said. ``Also absent was any mention of the proposals to eliminate
farm subsidy payments to this nation's largest, wealthiest farmers
and to tighten farm subsidy payment limits that were part of
President Bush's recent 1991 budget message to Congress.''
   In his budget proposal to Congress on Jan. 29, Bush said the
administration will work closely with lawmakers to close loopholes
in federal subsidy restrictions and to ``eliminate excessive
payments to wealthy farmers.''
   The Grange said the administration's proposals include features
that are both supported and opposed by its members.
   Conservation, trade, research and grain storage proposals are
close to Grange objectives, but flexibility, dairy and the
administration's plan to kill federal crop insurance are at odds
with current Grange policy.
   The National Farmers Union's appraisal of Bush farm bill
strategy was characterized by NFU president Leland Swenson as a
``house with no foundation. It may look good from the outside, but
you soon realize something pretty important is missing.''
   Yet, the administration's general blueprint has some features
the NFU finds appealing.
   ``Many of the recommendations closely follow those called for in
the farm bill proposal we announced last July,'' Swenson said.
``But recommending changes in planting decisions, set-aside
determinations, loan rate and the like, without any consideration
of farm income levels, is shortsighted at best.''
   The strongest appraisal of administration proposals came from
the National Farm Coalition, which says it is ``made up of 40
grassroots farm organizations from across the United States.''
   ``Secretary Yeutter's guidelines for a 1990 farm bill are just a
continuation of the 1985 farm bill, a disaster for farmers,
taxpayers, rural communities and the environment,'' said Ralph
Nodland, a North Dakota grain farmer and president of the coalition.
   Nodland said the administration plan would further reduce
farmers' income ``by keeping farm prices low.'' He said the
flexibility concept ``actually amounts to an option to keep cutting
prices.''

   Leftist guerrillas freed an American
priest Monday night who had been kidnapped in protest of President
Bush's visit to Colombia for last week's anti-drug summit.
   The priest, Francis Amico Ferrari, 43, said in a live radio
interview that he was released unharmed in the western Colombia
city of Cali.
   The radio network Caracol, which carried the interview, reported
that Amico Ferrari is from Houston. Other priests in his parish in
Cali had said last week that Amico Ferrari is from Rochester, N.Y.
   In Cartagena, a Caribbean port city where President Bush met
with three Latin presidents last Thursday, guerrillas dynamited an
electric power substation Monday night and attacked three police
posts, police there told The Associated Press. Five police officers
were wounded and much of the city of 530,000 people was left
without power, the police said.
   The National Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the
attack, the policeman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The group kidnapped Amico Ferrari Thursday morning in Cali while
on his way to his church in a slum neighborhood.
   The guerrillas also kidnapped two other American citizens last
week to protest Bush's visit and they remained in the hands of the
group, which is led by a former priest, Manuel Perez.
   Those two, James Donnelly of Detroit and David Kent of
Indianapolis, were kidnapped last Tuesday in the northwestern city
of Medellin.
   Amico Ferrari said after being released that he had been
lectured by the guerrillas on the need to nationalize foreign oil
holdings in Colombia, Latin America's foreign debt and right-wing
death squads.
   The Colombian attorney general's office says right-wing death
squads have killed hundreds of leftists in Colombia in the last
five years.
   Amico Ferrari said the leader of the guerrillas who kidnapped
him was polite and intelligent and treated him with respect. The
priest said he was treated well during his five days of captivity.
   Amico Ferrari is the superior of a parish in Cali that is in one
of that city's poorest neighborhoods. He founded the Basilian
Priests' branch in the neighborhood, San Andres, after arriving in
Colombia in 1987.
   The National Liberation Army issued a communique through
Colombian news media Friday claiming that the kidnappings were in
protest of Bush's visit.
   The communique accused the United States of trying to impose its
will on Colombia.
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the communique, which
declared: ``Gringos out ... El Salvador and Colombia will win!''
   The National Liberation Army was organized in the mid-1970s and
has followed the ideology of Cuba's Fidel Castro.
   There are an estimated 10,000 guerrillas in six groups in
Colombia. The National Liberation Army has become the most active
of the six in the last four years, blowing up oil pipelines,
ambushing army patrols, attacking military bases, kidnapping people
and attacking small towns to destroy police stations and rob banks.
   One Colombian guerrilla group, the April 19 Movement, named
after the date of a presidential election in 1970, has signed a
peace treaty with the government. Four other groups say they also
are interested in peace talks.
   The National Liberation Army has vowed to fight on, however.

<HEAD>Census Bureau Takes Pride in Keeping Answers Confidential</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pssst, can you keep a secret? The Census
Bureau can.
   The same people who churn out a seemingly endless supply of
details about Americans in general, will reveal nothing about
individuals.
   Urging people to answer the census, Bureau Director Barbara E.
Bryant stresses their responses are ``completely confidential.''
   ``The answers are not shared with any other government agency or
individual. They are combined into statistics, with individual
information kept private until the year 2062,'' she says.
   Confidentiality was not always the rule. Two centuries ago
copies of the census lists were posted in public places so people
could point out omissions and errors.
   But today individual privacy is both policy and law. And the
Census Bureau has compiled an enviable record of protecting the
information people provide.
   For example, even during the hysteria following the bombing of
Pearl Harbor in 1941, the bureau refused to release the names and
addresses of Japanese-Americans living on the West Coast.
   It also turned down the attorney general's demand for
information about individuals suspected of being communists during
a Red Scare in 1947.
   And in 1980 the bureau refused to comply with a federal court
order demanding addresses for certain city officials.
   In turning down the court, bureau officials said even releasing
information on the number of people living in various apartments
could harm individuals by revealing those doubling-up or by
disclosing the presence of squatters, welfare fathers, illegal
aliens and others.
   Confidentiality is especially stressed in promotion efforts
directed at the Hispanic community, where many people may be in the
country illegally, and those who are legal often distrust
government officials.
   The law requires the bureau to count all the people in the
nation, not just citizens. So it makes a special effort to reach
those who are reluctant to be included.
   Hence the emphasis that information given the census is not
passed on to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, or the
Internal Revenue Service, or the Selective Service, or anyone else.
   Names and addresses of individuals are collected to make sure no
one is missed or counted twice. But they are not recorded in the
giant computers which compile and sort the census information,
officials say.
   Those machines merely digest the information about people living
on particular blocks or census tracts across the nation, and
provide that information for a variety of statistical uses.
   In cases where even releasing those statistics would reveal
something about an individual, the numbers are kept private.
   For example, the 1980 Census found 2,315 people living in Census
Tract 20 of Kansas City, including one black person.
   Normally data such as income, type of residence, employment and
so forth is released by race.
   But not in this tract, because it would have been obvious who
was being reported on. Indeed, the bureau suppresses data unless a
large number of people are averaged out, so that no one can learn
about an individual or family or small group.
   Census Bureau employees who reveal information about individuals
are subject to a $5,000 fine and five years in prison. But no one
has ever been convicted of releasing such data.
   Only after 72 years does the information on individuals become
public record. Then it is made available at the National Archives
for people doing research on their ancestors. That means individual
data from the 1920 census will become available in two years.
   The only use of census data permitted earlier is for individuals
who request information to prove their age. This often is needed to
qualify for pension benefits or for some other purpose when birth
certificates or other documents have been lost.
   The legal confidentiality of the census was instituted in 1910
to protect information on businesses, and in 1930 that was extended
to cover the general population.
   Privacy was apparently not a consideration in 1790, when the
first U.S. census was taken. The U.S. Marshals who took that census
posted their lists in public, a practice that continued until 1830.

<HEAD>Congress Trying to Muster Resources for Departing Soldiers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress is mobilizing for the possibility
that large numbers of troops will be mustered out as a result of
growing world peace.
   At least two lawmakers have introduced proposals providing a
``khaki parachute'' to soften the landing of soldiers into civilian
life, and a law that took effect in January could lay the
groundwork for making readjustment easier.
   Among the measures:
   _Legislation introduced by Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y., to
restore unemployment compensation benefits to ex-military personnel
to the same number of weeks available to civilians.
   Veterans now must wait four weeks to start 13 weeks of benefits
instead of one week to start 26 weeks of benefits. The current
formula for veterans dates back to the beginning of the 1980s when
an effort was made to cut off eligibility altogether.
   ``In an era when we are cutting defense spending at the same
time we expect our fighting men and women to risk their lives in
Grenada and Panama, the least we can do is provide them with 26
weeks of benefits after the coming reduction in force,'' Downey
said.
   _A bill introduced by Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., that would
entitle enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers to
separation pay if they have completed five or more years of active
duty before being involuntarily discharged. Officers already
receive up to $30,000 in severance pay, Slattery said.
   ``Many men and women join the service expecting to spend their
entire career serving their country,'' Slattery said. ``I think
that it is unfair for the government to release them without some
kind of compensation.''
   An estimate prepared by the private Non Commissioned Officers
Association says the cost would be $58 million to $105 million,
depending on when in the fiscal year the soldiers are separated.
   The NCOA says that money would be offset by savings of $126
million in unemployment compensation. Those 5,000 officers were
earning $9.6 million a month, the estimate says.
   _A package of veterans' benefits legislation that was enacted
late last year set up a pilot program to provide employment and
training services to members of armed forces preparing to leave.
   ``Oddly enough, this was not in anticipation'' of the budget or
events in Europe, said John V. Meyers, deputy assistant secretary
of labor for veterans' employment and training. ``However, the
timing of the pilot program couldn't be better.''
   The program now is borrowing staff from other functions. A
report on the operations is due in May 1992, but Meyers says
large-scale troop reductions could hasten full implementation.
   The program helps members of the military within 180 days of
leaving the service. The help includes economic profiles of
regions, wage rates in areas, resume preparation and help in
applying skills acquired in the military to civilian jobs.
   The pilot program is underway at Camp Pendleton, Calif., for
Marines; San Antonio, Texas, for the Air Force; Norfolk, Va., and
Jacksonville, Fla., for the Navy; and Ft. Benning, Ga., and Ft.
Eustis, Va., for the Army. Programs for disabled personnel are at
San Antonio for the Air Force, Jacksonville for the Navy and
Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, Colo.
   Meantime, the Department of Veterans' Affairs says it expects a
large new wave of veterans to have little impact on its ability to
deliver services. Most of the veterans are relatively young and
healthy, so they should place little demand on the health care and
compensation system, said spokesman Bonner Day.
   Day said he expected an increase in applications for the GI
Bill, which provides payments for college or other post-high school
education.
   But some veterans' groups say the system already is strapped as
a result of tight budgets, and the biggest problem is with the time
it takes to handle benefits applications.
   Employees who handle the GI Bill, they say, are working to ease
the backlog in other areas. Discharged soldiers who fall upon hard
times may try to resurrect old injuries in order to get veterans'
compensation, worsening the logjam, the groups say.

<HEAD>Mayor, Cop, Drug Addict: A Tale Of Three Brothers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is a story of three brothers. The
oldest is mayor of New Haven. The youngest rose to the rank of a
police detective. The middle one descended into the world of drug
addiction and was charged this month with being a pusher.
   On Feb. 6, the 37th day of Mayor John Daniels' first term of
office in this southern Connecticut city of 127,000, and 10 days
before Detective Melvin Daniels was to put in for retirement, the
lives of the three brothers were changed forever.
   Robert Daniels, 48, surrendered to Melvin to answer cocaine
possession and trafficking charges, and the mayor was put on the
spot to explain how brothers could be so different.
   Few suggest that John Daniels, 53, New Haven's first black
mayor, will lose his position as a role model for this city's black
youth or see his relentless anti-drug message undermined.
   As Melvin Daniels, the youngest of the brothers at age 45, put
it: ``You can't be held responsible for an almost 50-year-old man.''
   WELI radio host Steve Kalb said that when he wondered out loud
whether the mayor should have kept closer tabs on his brother, ``I
got jumped on.'' Mostly, callers expressed sorrow over the turn of
events.
   A former city alderman, state senator and businessman, the
soft-spoken, nattily dressed John Daniels established an
unblemished record of public service as he kept his sights on the
mayor's office for more than 20 years.
   But while John's fortunes were rising, Robert's were falling.
   The mayor said Robert's problems began in the late 1970s, when
he got laid off from his blue-collar job and got mixed up with the
wrong crowd. Family members' efforts to help met with little
success. One stay in a residential treatment program had no lasting
effect.
   When Robert Daniels was arraigned this month, he listed no
assets, and was granted a court-appointed attorney.
   ``Some people just take a lot longer than others to hit
bottom,'' said Melvin.
   Robert, who was using the alias of Dan Daniels, allegedly sold
cocaine to an undercover officer on two occasions. A warrant was
issued for his arrest following a raid on his apartment that netted
$7,500 worth of cocaine. When Robert gave himself up to his brother
four days after the raid, it was his first arrest.
   According to a court source, he entered a 28-day drug treatment
program at Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown three days
after his arrest. No trial date has been set.
   The brothers have gotten together only occasionally for holidays
and family birthdays, although Robert did stop by for John's
victory party Nov. 7.
   Melvin, who has spent the last five years on the front lines of
New Haven's escalating drug war, is trying to forget the day he
faced off against his brother in that battle.
   ``I don't want to keep on opening it up,'' said the police
detective, whose nickname is ``Rock.'' ``I want to let that thing
die.''
   ``Let me put it simply for you,'' he said. ``It's part of the
territory of being a police officer. Even though it hurts
sometimes, you do what you got to do.''
   John Daniels Jr. is the oldest of the three sons and two
daughters of John and Ludelia Daniels, who were on hand to watch
him sworn in as mayor. The family moved from Georgia to New Haven
when John Jr. was a young boy.
   A star football player in high school, John attended Villanova
University on a full athletic scholarship. His first job was as a
teacher, and he later worked for Qunnipiac College, Yale University
and a city development agency.
   Melvin entered the Navy after high school and worked as a
mechanic before becoming a housing authority police officer in
1969. ``He is sort of a carbon copy of John,'' said Albert Rogers,
the mayor's executive assistant and friend since grammar school.
``He just went out and did his job.''
   Robert, who has two daughters but is separated from his wife,
was always ``a very lovable and happy-go-lucky guy,'' said Melvin.
   In his 1960 high school yearbook, Robert listed dancing as his
favorite hobby and entry into the Air Force as his ambition. Melvin
said his brother did go on to join the Air Force but eventually
received a medical discharge because of asthma.
   In the black community, sympathy was expressed for Robert's
family.
   ``I have compassion and support for his family because I know
what it feels like,'' said Lisa Sullivan, a Yale graduate student
and political activist who advises the NAACP Youth Council. ``I
have cousins and uncles in my family who sell drugs and are
addicted to drugs. The black community is in crisis.''
   The mayor told a news conference on Feb. 7 that ``if the fact
that the mayor's brother can fall prey to the lure of drugs will
help the rest of the community realize that it can happen in any
family, to any one, then something good has come of Robert's
tragedy.''

<HEAD>Spending Tops $20 Million, Month Before Primaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The job pays $93,432 a year, but seven
candidates for governor already have spent more than $20 million
trying to land it, and analysts say the final tab could hit $50
million.
   The bulk of the money is going for production and broadcast of
television commercials, exposure that's mandatory for reaching the
state's 17 million residents.
   Texas is so large that to blanket it, a candidate must purchase
air time on more than 70 stations in 21 TV markets, including
outlets in Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   ``Campaign costs are going up because of television and postage.
The television advertising is so expensive and the markets are so
numerous, it costs a ton to run for office,'' said George
Christian, political consultant and former press secretary to
President Lyndon Johnson.
   ``It's unfortunate,'' he said. ``But it's a fact of life in
Texas.''
   Four Republicans and three Democrats are vying for nominations
in the March 13 primaries to succeed retiring Gov. Bill Clements,
the state's only Republican governor in 100 years.
   Top spender is the man who according to polls is the leader in
the Republican primary field: millionaire oilman Clayton Williams.
He has spent $6.4 million _ more than $4 million of it from his
personal bank account _ and first aired television commercials in
August.
   State Treasurer Ann Richards, who leaped to national attention
by keynoting the 1988 Democratic convention, leads in Democratic
race polls but lags in fund-raising at $2.1 million.
   The Democratic financial lead goes to Attorney General Jim
Mattox, who raised more than $4 million and spent $3.7 million,
including almost $2 million on television ads in the past month
alone.
   Former Gov. Mark White, who raised $3 million since joining the
Democratic race in November.
   According to campaign finance reports filed by all candidates,
spending on the race totaled $20.1 million by Feb. 12. And that was
with a month left until the primary and two months until the
expected runoff elections.
   Analysts in both parties have said that by November, the race
will easily eclipse the state record $33.5 million spent in 1986,
when Clements ousted White.
   Williams defends his spending as proof of his independence from
special interests.
   ``Clayton is not beholden to anybody. Some people consider that
an asset, to be able to contribute to your own campaign,'' said
Williams aide Scott Bohnenkamp.
   Williams' GOP opponents accuse him of trying to buy the
Republican nomination.
   Referring to Williams' cowboy image and two admitted fist fights
since he turned 50, a spokeswoman for GOP hopeful Tom Luce
retorted, ``I don't know how tough Clayton is, but he has a black
belt in spending.''
   Asked about soaring campaign costs, Mark Sanders, press
secretary to Republican candidate Kent Hance, said, ``Television
advertising. It's just that simple.'' Hance, a former ``Boll
Weevil'' Democratic congressman who changed parties in 1985, has
raised $2.2 million. Recent polls put him second in the GOP race.
   Candidates say collecting money takes more work than it used to
since the state's oil and real estate busts.
   ``I don't believe they're stealing any, but they do have to beg
and borrow,'' Christian said.
   ``It's really hurtful to campaigns because it means they have to
be devoted primarily to raising money to get their message out on
TV. It's not just the candidate. Everybody is hustling for money
and, they're hustling against great competition right now _ there
are legislative races, local races,'' he said.
   Mattox was criticized for raising money from law firms while
serving as attorney general. But his strategy of banking money
early has let him outspend the other Democrats as election day
nears.
   ``There's a time to reap and a time to sow,'' said Mattox
spokesman Kelly Fero. ``We reaped early and now we're sowing. We
still have more to spend, and the bulk of it is, of course, on TV.''
   Ms. Richards, who raised funds with the help of celebrities such
as Lily Tomlin and Marlo Thomas, has front-runner status to help
offset her smaller bank account, Christian said.
   ``Because she's ahead and seems to have a fairly strong base (of
support) ... they didn't have to spend as much money early,'' he
said. ``They have squirreled their money away for the end and will
hit the television with a pretty heavy buy. When you're ahead, you
can do that.''
   Glenn Smith, Ms. Richards' campaign manager, said that while her
$2.1 million is less than Mattox's war chest or White's, the bulk
of it came from small contributors, not regular political backers.

   The dollar held steady against the yen Tuesday,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued its fall.
   The dollar closed at 144.58 yen, up 0.06 yen from its day-before
level of 144.52 yen. It traded narrowly throughout the day after
its 144.50-yen opening, ranging between 144.45 yen and 144.65 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 237.72 points
Monday, shed an additional 327.08 points, or 0.8 percent, to end
the day at 36,895.52. Trading was said to be light at about 330
million shares.
   Brokers attributed the stock market's loss to persistent fears
of another rise in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate _ the
rate charged to banks _which now stands at 4.25 percent following
three increases last year.
   Dealers said the speculation was reinforced when the central
bank released figures in the afternoon showing that Japan's money
supply grew by 11.5 percent in January from a year earlier. It was
the second straight month of double-digit money growth, a sign of
inflation, and a rise from December's growth of 10.6 percent.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno has warned repeatedly about
the threat of inflation, especially in light of recent higher oil
prices and the yen's persistent weakness that has been pushing up
import costs.
   ``If money supply growth is high, then the possibility of a
discount rate hike increases,'' explained a dealer at a Japanese
securities firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said he
doubted any increase would come right away.
   Chris Schreiber, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said:
``You also have selling pressures ahead of year-end settlements in
March.'' The Japanese fiscal year ends March 31.
   Other negative factors Schreiber pointed to included an
oversupply of convertible bonds coming onto the market, earnings
disappointments and concerns about a slowdown in the U.S. economy.
   ``Basically, there are no new buying incentives,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Raise Possibility of Renewed Famine in Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are warning that war and bad
weather are causing new and immediate hunger emergencies in western
Africa.
   The officials say anti-government forces in Ethiopia have shut
down a port that is a key entry point for food assistance,
threatening the lives of up to 5 million Ethiopians. Severely
diminished harvests because of poor rainfall in northern Ethiopia
are further aggravating the situation.
   U.S. officials say a crisis situation is also rapidly developing
in the Sudan, where a bitter civil war is preventing the transport
of relief supplies to rebel-held territory in the southern part of
the country.
   President Bush sent a letter to the Sudanese president last week
asking for his cooperation in restarting the international relief
effort, to which the United States contributes $15.7 million.
   Renewed fighting has led to the suspension of food flights to
southern Sudan and the government is preventing the departure of a
relief train along a route where food shortages are severe. The
rebels also have been blocking relief efforts.
   Estimates are that 1 million to 3 million Sudanese could suffer
from famine.
   In Ethiopia, the cutoff of relief supplies through Massawa, a
deep water port on the Red Sea, affects the Eritrea and Tigray
provinces and portions of three other provinces.
   ``The next six weeks to two months is the critical time,'' said
Andrew Natsios, director of the Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance. ``We're trying to explore options for getting the food
in.''
   He added that a ``worst nightmare'' scenario is developing _ a
civil war and a famine in the same area at the same time.
   A Western relief official told The Washington Post, ``If the
port is closed for any length of time, then there is the
possibility of tragedy n northern Ethiopia.''
   The situation evokes memories of the 1984-85 period in Ethiopia
when more than a million people died, primarily because of drought.
   Renewed drought last year in Ethiopia touched off a major
international relief program led by the United States and the
European Community, both of which funnel food donations through
private voluntary organizations. Other contributing countries
include Canada and Australia.
   The United States has either delivered or pledged more than $70
million to the relief effort. The figure for the rest of the
international community is about $84 million, according to U.S.
estimates.
   The goal of the donor countries was to compensate for severe
shortages expected early this year resulting from disappointing
rainfall last summer.
   But earlier this month, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front
staged one of its most daring assaults in 27 years of warfare with
its capture of Massawa and the road leading inland.
   Massawa had been the entry point for food for the needy in
Eritrea and also for provinces further south, including Tigray,
where Ethiopia's Marxist government is being challenged by yet
another rebel group.

<HEAD>Rebels Launch Attacks in Cartagena, Free American; Police Seize
Missiles</HEAD>

   Guerrillas dynamited a power station and
attacked police posts in Cartagena, and police seized 10
shoulder-fired missiles from drug traffickers four days after
President Bush's visit, authorities said.
   Also Monday night, leftist guerrillas freed an American priest
who was kidnapped on Thursday to protest Bush's visit to the the
Caribbean port city that day for an anti-drug summit with three
Andean presidents.
   Francis Amico Ferrari, 43, of Rochester, N.Y. said in a radio
interview that he was released unharmed in Cali, the western city
where he was kidnapped near his parish.
   Two other Americans remained in captivity: 65-year-old James
Donnelly of Detroit and 40-year-old David Kent of Indianapolis.
They were kidnapped by guerrillas one week ago in the northwest
city of Medellin.
   In Cartagena, guerrillas dynamited an electric power substation
Monday night, knocking out power to much of the city of 530,000
people, and they attacked three police posts, wounding five
officers, police said by telephone. The leftist National Liberation
Army, led by former priest Manuel Perez, claimed responsibility,
the police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A news release from the Administrative Security Department, the
country's secret police, said the shoulder-fired missiles _ which
can shoot down planes _ were found in a raid Monday on a Bogota
drug hideout.
   It said two men arrested there were suspects in the November
slaying of TV news anchorman Enrique Pulido in the capital. Pulido
was one of 13 news media workers killed _ presumably by assassins
working for drug bosses _ since President Virgilio Barco declared
war on drug trafficers in August.
   The police gave few details of the raid.
   The U.S. Secret Service warned before Bush visited Cartagena
that drug traffickers had shoulder-fired SAM-7s, surface-to-air
missiles capable of downing large aircraft.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel has offered to dismantle its drug
empire and stop its campaign of terror in Colombia if the
government would agree to a truce and stop extraditing leading drug
suspects to the United States to stand trial. Security forces have
kept pursuing the traffickers, however.
   Bush went to Cartagena to meet with Presidents Barco, Alan
Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia, and all reaffirmed
their will to fight drug traffickers.
   The National Liberation Army issued a communique through
Colombian news media Friday claiming the kidnappings were in
protest of Bush's visit. It accused the United States of trying to
impose its will on Colombia.
   The guerrillas also have promised a wave of violence leading up
to the mayoral and congressional election March 11.
   Amico Ferrari said after being released that he had been
lectured by the guerrillas on the need to nationalize foreign oil
holdings in Colombia and other topics. He spoke in an interview
with the radio network Caracol.
   On Sunday, the National Liberation Army blew up the country's
main oil pipeline for the sixth time this year, this time near the
village of Convencion, 250 miles north of Bogota, the government
oil company Ecopetrol said in a news release.
   The attacks are an effort to force the government to nationalize
U.S. and other foreign oil holdings. Officials said the pipeline
would be out of service until at least Wednesday.
   The pipeline carries oil from the big Cano Limon field in
northeastern Colombia to the Caribbean coast.
   The same guerrilla group tried to blow up an oil pipeline near
Yopal, 125 miles north of Bogota, Sunday night, but the explosion
did not break the line, Ecopetrol said.
   The National Liberation Army was organized in the mid-1970s and
has followed the ideology of Cuba's Fidel Castro.

   President Bush's attitude toward
organized labor appears to be a marked improvement from the Reagan
era, labor leaders said, but they doubt there's been a substantive
shift in policy.
   The Bush administration deserves credit for its involvement in
the Pittston coal strike _ Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole met with
both sides and appointed a ``super mediator'' _ and for
compromising on labor's long-sought hike in the minimum wage, union
leaders said.
   However, AFL-CIO leaders gathered for their annual winter
meeting also complained that Bush, while praising worker movements
abroad such as Solidarity in Poland, has demonstrated ``union
busting'' tendencies at home by vetoing legislation to create a
commission on the Eastern Airlines strike.
   ``Our president seems to be saying, `Workers' rights are fine in
other parts of the world, but not in my backyard,''' said John
Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union.
   The Executive Council of the 4.1 million-member AFL-CIO hopes to
achieve improved relations with the Bush administration as its
33-member board meets today with Mrs. Dole.
   ``I give Bush and Liz Dole an A-plus on Pittston and a zero on
Eastern,'' said Joyce Miller, vice president of the Amalgamated
Colthing and Textile Workes Union.
   Many union officials considered Ronald Reagan, who fired
striking air traffic controllers in 1981 and effectively killed
that union, the worst president of the century for organized labor.
   ``President Bush and his `kinder, gentler' nation at least talks
about issues that affect workers, like education, child care and
health care. It took them long enough to come around on minimum
wage, so we'll see on the others,'' Sweeney said.
   Susan Cowell, vice president of the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union, said Bush has been forced to improve the climate
toward labor.
   ``Reagan created a revolution that was exposed as a fraud, and
the public tide has turned against it. Bush is almost forced to be
more moderate. That limits the degree to which he can hurt us,''
Cowell said.
   ``Bush is an odd character. He doesn't embrace an ideology the
way Reagan does, but it's hard to see a policy difference,'' she
said.
   Last year, Bush agreed to address the AFL-CIO's convention in
Washington, marking the first time a president had addressed the
federation since Jimmy Carter did in 1979. Reagan refused to speak
in 1981 and was never invited again.
   At the time, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, who a month
earlier had called Bush ``Reagan Lite,'' said the president's
willingness to strike a compromise on minimum wage showed their had
been some improvement over labor's strained relationship with
Reagan.
   On Monday, Kirkland said union leaders would continue to lobby
Congress for an override of Bush's veto of the Eastern Airlines
legislation.
   As expected, the federation's Executive Council skipped a vote
on pro-choice resolutions and instead appointed a 14-member
committee of union leaders to determine whether a stand should be
taken.
   Kirkland said the panel would not be swayed much by a national
Right to Life Committee letter-writing campaign that urged union
officials not to take a stand.
   ``I've been around a while, and I think I can tell grass roots
from AstroTurf,'' Kirkland said, insinuating the letters were not
from rank-and-file union members.
   The letters warned union leaders that rank-and-file members
opposed to abortion would likely seek to have part of their union
dues withheld if the AFL-CIO, which has sidestepped the issue for
more than a decade, adopted a pro-choice position.
   ``I do not think the committee will be moved by threats or
suggestions of reprisals. I think the committee will address the
issues fairly and rationally and on the merits and will act
accordingly,'' Kirkland said.
   National Right to Life Committee officials have said the AFL-CIO
should sit the issue out because it does not impact collective
bargaining or workplace conditions.
   Pro-choice union officials contend the issue impacts the
economic well-being of working women. They note the AFL-CIO has
traditionally taken a stand on a wide range of issues, including
civil rights, gay rights and school busing.
   ``I would say that the committee probably breaks down almost
50-50,'' said Miller, a pro-choice member of the abortion panel.
She predicted the AFL-CIO could adopt a pro-choice position as long
as it included language acknowledging the moral and religious views
of some union members.
   Kirkland declined to identify his personal position. The panel's
chairman, William Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union, is pro-choice but has said his
personal feelings would not influence the committee's decision.
   Kirkland did not give the panel a deadline, but pro-choice
officials want a decision by the council's May meeting. That would
let labor leaders use the issue when making endorsements for the
1990 elections.

<HEAD>Strong Earthquake Hits Tokyo Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buildings in downtown Tokyo swayed for more than a
minute Tuesday as a strong earthquake rocked the capital area.
There were no immediate reports of serious injuries or damage.
   The earthquake struck at 3:53 p.m. and sent office workers
leaping from their desks. Trains on two high-speed ``bullet'' train
lines were briefly halted, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK)
reported.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said the quake measured a
preliminary 6.6 on the Richter scale and was centered off the Izu
peninsula southwest of Tokyo, an area of high seismic activity. Its
epicenter was 12 miles below the ocean bed, it said.
   An earthquake registering 6 on the Richter scale can cause
serious damage in populated areas. A quake measuring 7 is
considered major and capable of widespread damage.
   Japan is hit frequently by earthquakes, and many buildings in
the Tokyo area are designed to withstand strong temblors.
   The earthquake registered 4 on the Japanese scale of 7 in Tokyo,
Yokohama and Tateyama, west of the capital, meteorological
officials said.
   A quake registering 4 on the Japanese scale is strong enough to
topple such objects as vases. The Japanese scale measures ground
motion at particular locations and is not convertible to the
Richter scale, which measures an earthquake's total strength.
   Each increase of one number in the open-ended Richter scale
corresponds to a tenfold increase in magnitude.
   Meteorological officials said there was no danger of tsunami, or
strong ocean waves caused by seismic activity.

   Bronze baby shoes? Forget it. Modern fathers
are going right to the source for souvenirs by smearing plaster on
the ballooning bellies of their pregnant wives.
   The idea is pregnant with comic possibilities. But belly laughs
don't bother Fred and Dionne Scobie of suburban Sherman Oaks, who
call their creation Dr. Stork's Original Pregnant Tummy Cast Kit.
   ``Sure, it's a giggly thing. Everybody reacts the way you do.
They giggle,'' Fred Scobie, 43, said Monday. ``We've had so much
fun with it all this time and we decided there was some economic
potential here.
   ``The phone has been ringing off the hook.''
   The kit is available by mail order for $19.95 plus $3 for
shipping and comes with everything needed to make a mold of the
mother-to-be's tummy _ gauze, plaster, markers and blue and pink
ribbons.
   After it dries, guests sign the plaster shell. ``They write
things like, `Keep out front' and `It's been a long time baby,'''
Scobie said.
   The Scobies hung the finished products for both of their
children _ Dave, 4, and Jim, 3 _ on the wall in their den.
   ``We have them hanging next to the deer antlers. It's really a
trophy,'' said Scobie. ``It is really cherished. The kids are
fascinated by this. They know they came from mommie's tummy and
it's just beautiful to watch them.''

   Seventeen-year-old Kent Bonham is rooting for
his opponent to win a seat on the school board.
   Bonham, a Westside High School senior and editor of the school
paper, spoke in favor of the re-election of District 66 school
board President Helen Kelley _ his friend's mother _ at a recent
nominating caucus.
   When no one volunteered to run against Ms. Kelley, Bonham agreed
to a request that he submit his name ``just to get things rolling''
since at least two candidates are required for each position.
   ``I had to get home and read three acts of `Hamlet,' so I did.''
   To his surprise, Bonham said, he was selected from among six
candidates to run against Mrs. Kelley on May 15.
   ``So I guess I'm running for the school board,'' he said. ``I
was kind of shocked. Mrs. Kelley is a close friend, and she knows
how much I want her to win.''
   Mrs. Kelley, 51, a former Westside teacher, said she is a friend
of Bonham's family and her son, Rick, is a friend of Bonham.
   ``I have a very high opinion of him,'' she said. ``And I am
proud to know he is a product of the District 66 school system.''

<TEXT>
   Two Nepalese soldiers of the United Nations
peacekeeping force were killed and six others wounded when a shell
hit their position in south Lebanon, a U.N. spokesman said today.
   The Nepalese position in the village of Byout Assiyad was hit
directly by a 120mm mortar round at midday Monday, said Timur
Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.
   ``Fifteen other mortar rounds fired from an Israeli-controlled
area inside the security zone fell near the position,'' Goksel said.
   Israil carved out the ``security zone'' in June 1985 after it
withdrew the bulk of its occupation army from Lebanon, ending a
three-year invasion.
   Aamong the victims was a warrant officer who arrived in Lebanon
on Feb. 12, said Goksel, adding that the other fatality and the six
casualties had been due to leave the country next week.
   The spokesman said they were evacuated by U.N. helicopters and
ambulances to the force's headquarters in the town of Naqoura on
the Lebanese-Israeli border.
   The 5,800-strong U.N. force, drawn from nine nations, was
deployed in the embattled south in 1978 under a U.N. Security
Council resolution.

<HEAD>Acid Rain May Be Culprit in Salamander Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polluted snow from acid rain may be
killing off salamanders in the Colorado Rockies, one of a series of
mysterious population declines among amphibians around the globe, a
researcher said.
   Scientists fear the decline of frog, toad and salamander
populations _ even in relatively pristine national parks _ may
presage ecological disaster.
   ``Amphibians are tough critters,'' said David Wake, director of
the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``They survived whatever wiped out the dinosaurs, and
they have thrived through the age of mammals. If they start to
check out now, we better take it seriously.''
   An 8-year study by John Harte, a professor at the university,
indicates a link between declines of hardy, 6-inch tiger
salamanders in the Rocky Mountains and an increase in the acidity
of ponds in which they live.
   Harte's study noted that snow formed from acid rain melted in
the late spring, pouring into 14 ponds he studied and raising their
acid level.
   The study found acid levels such as those created by melting
snow severely disrupted egg growth and killed developing salamander
embryos, Harte said Monday.
   Studies in the eastern United States have shown the impact of
acid rain on fish populations, but Harte's study is the first
strong evidence that the same problem may be hitting the West, the
university said in a statement.
   Harte collaborated on the project with Erika Hoffman, a
scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
   The study was presented at a special meeting called by the
National Research Council at the National Academy of Science's
Beckman Center in Irvine in Southern California. Scientists were to
meet through today to discuss ``Declining Amphibian Populations _ A
Global Phenomenon.''
   Amphibians are cold-blooded, moist-skinned creatures who spend
part of their lives in the water and part on land. Declines in
local populations on six continents were first noted in the late
1970s.
   In the past few years, drastic population declines have been
noted in such species as the golden toad in Costa Rican rain
forests, the yellow-legged frog in the Sierra Nevada, and spotted
frogs in the northwestern U.S., which now are being considered for
addition to the endangered species list.
   Suggestions about the cause of declines in specific populations
range from acid rain and other water pollution to disease,
exploitation for food and climactic changes.

<TEXT>
   Stormie Jones, the 12-year-old recipient of
the world's first heart-liver transplant, underwent a second liver
transplant early Tuesday because of damage from hepatitis.
   A team of surgeons began the operation around 3:15 a.m., said
Liz McMahon, a spokeswoman for Children's Hospital.
   The surgery was expected to last 12 to 16 hours, said another
hospital spokeswoman, Margy Buczynski.
   ``The doctors aren't expecting many complications because she is
in good condition,'' Ms. Buczynski said.
   Stormie and her mother, Lois Purcell, flew to Pittsburgh from
their home in White Settlement, Texas, on Monday.
   The surgery is necessary because Stormie's first donated liver
no longer functions normally due to damage from hepatitis, said Liz
McMahon, another hospital spokeswoman.
   Ms. Buczynski would not identify the donor of the new liver.
   Stormie's heart-liver transplant on Feb. 14, 1984, was done by a
medical team led by transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl. Starzl
will be present for part of the latest operation, but Dr. Andreas
Tzakis will lead the team, Ms. Buczynski said.
   The first transplant took 16 hours. The donated heart and liver
came from a 4-year-old girl who died in a New York car accident.
   Before the double transplant, Stormie had suffered two heart
attacks and undergone two triple coronary bypass operations.
   She suffered from a rare congenital disease which increased to
10 times normal the level of cholesterol in her blood. The
imbalance was caused by a faulty liver.
   Stormie was leading a fairly normal life until October 1988,
when she was re-admitted to Children's Hospital for possible organ
rejection. She improved the next month after surgeons removed a
bile duct obstruction, but was back again in January 1989 because
of elevated enzyme levels that interfered with her anti-rejection
medication, cyclosporine.
   The girl started losing liver function in November and returned
to the hospital once again. Starzl replaced her cyclosporine with
an experimental Japanese drug, FK-506, believed to be 50 to 100
times more powerful with fewer side effects.
   Stormie returned to Children's Hospital on Jan. 6 with more
liver problems. Tests showed no evidence of organ rejection, but
rather a non-infectious form of hepatitis.
   Surgeons followed Stormie's 1984 operation with two more
attempts at heart-liver transplants, but both patients died within
a few days of surgery.
   Those were the only attempts in America at replacing the heart
and liver in a simultaneous operation until Dec. 3, when Pittsburgh
surgeons performed the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant.
   The patient, Cindy Martin, 26, of Archbald, remains in critical
condition in the intensive care unit at Presbyterian-University
Hospital.
   Ms. Martin also is receiving FK-506, and has experienced no
organ rejection.

   A near-terminally ill woman implanted with
an artificial lung device died about 15 hours after surgery.
   A team of anesthesiologists and surgeons at the Penn State
University center placed the device, known as the IntraVascular
Oxygenator, in the woman at noon Sunday, the university said. The
unidentified women died of pneumonia at 3 a.m. Monday.
   Dr. Michael T. Snider, director of the study at the Milton S.
Hershey Medical Center, said the device helped sustain the
34-year-old woman's life during the hours it was used.
   ``This was a woman with a near-terminal disease,'' Snider said.
``Unfortunately, her disease was too far advanced to save her.''
   It was the second clinical trial of the experimental device.
   Melicia Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, Texas, died Feb. 7 of lung
failure. She lived 4{ days on the device, known as IVOX, which had
functioned normally after her operation at LDS Hospital in Salt
Lake City.
   The device mimics the lungs' ability to filter carbon dioxide
out of the blood and replace it with oxygen. It was designed to
give damaged lungs time to rest and recover.
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved experimental use
of the device for up to seven days in patients with respiratory
problems.
   Before the lung-assist device, mechanical ventilation has been
the only method to help patients who have trouble breathing.
   The device is a 20-inch bundle of hundreds of synthetic tubes
almost as fine as human hair, with walls so thin that oxygen and
carbon dioxide can pass through.
   It is inserted via the neck or groin into the inferior vena
cava, the large vein that brings blood to the heart.
   Two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the
bundle of tubes and lead out of the body. One delivers oxygen to
the blood while the other removes carbon dioxide.
   
   J.D. Mortensen, a thoracic surgeon and vice president for
research at CardioPulmonics Inc. in Salt Lake City, conceived the
IVOX and developed it.

<HEAD>Former Treasury Undersecretary Dies at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H. Chapman Rose, a former assistant secretary
and undersecretary of the Treasury in the Eisenhower
Administration, has died of emphysema. He was 83.
   Rose, who died Feb. 17 at Sibley Memorial Hospital, also was a
former national managing partner of the law firm of Jones, Day,
Reavis &amp; Pogue.
   In 1932 he became an associate in a predecessor firm of Jones
Day in Cleveland, where he practiced law until 1976, except during
his years in government service. Rose was a national managing
partner of the firm, which has 17 offices in this country, Europe,
the Far East and the Middle East, from 1974 to 1976.
   He then became a counsel to the firm and returned to Washington,
retiring in 1983.
   Rose first came to Washington in 1931 and worked for a year as a
law clerk and secretary to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes Jr.
   He returned during World War II as an Army lawyer, having
attained the rank of colonel and earned the Legion of Merit.
   He directed the Office of Contract Settlement from 1946 to 1947,
then helped found Jones Day's Washington offices before returning
to Cleveland as a partner in 1949.
   Four years later, at the beginning of the Eisenhower
administration, Rose returned to the nation's capital as assistant
secretary of the Treasury. He supervised the Coast Guard, the
Customs Service and the Secret Service. In 1955 Rose was named
Treasury undersecretary.
   He returned to private law practice in 1956.
   Rose is survived by his wife of 51 years, Katherine Cast Rose of
Washington; a son, Jonathan Chapman of Alexandria; and a grandson.

   Black members of the Boston School Committee
demanded the right to veto a replacement for the city's first black
superintendent, whose ouster last week has been called racist.
   During a two-hour meeting with committee President Daniel Burke,
the four black members Monday also urged that the replacement of
Laval Wilson be a minority who would be selected by a panel of
community activists, parents and teachers in a nationwide search.
   Burke rejected the demands and said the committee would search
for a successor to Wilson, 54, who was dismissed Feb. 13.
   ``I am very confident that the Boston School Committee with the
full input of its minority members can adequately find an interim
and a superintendent,'' Burke said.
   The black members, along with committee vice president John
Grady, a strong Wilson supporter who is white, walked out of the
committee meeting last week shortly before the 7-1 vote in favor of
ousting Wilson was taken.
   Burke met Monday with the five behind closed doors at the
People's Baptist Church in an attempt to reconcile the 13-member
panel.
   Minority leaders have charged the ouster was racist, since the
seven members who voted to remove Wilson are white.
   The group said the process deciding Wilson's fate was unfair,
but did not recommend reversing the decision to buy out the
remaining 18 months of his contract.
   ``His reputation has been so maligned, his authority so
undermined that he believes it would not be in the best interests
of the children to try and prolong the confusion,'' said member
John O'Bryant. ``He has asked us not to fight to keep him.''
   O'Bryant asked that Wilson's contract be bought out for about
$200,000; Burke and other committee members have said buying out
Wilson's contract would cost between $130,000 and $160,000.
   Critics of Wilson said he failed to work effectively with
parents, students, teachers and others to improve the city's
schools. They said little progress has been noticed in the school
system since Wilson's appointment five years ago.
   Blacks, Hispanics and Asians make up about three-fourths of the
city's 56,000 school population.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall Sharply Again, Dollar Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index fell
sharply for the second consecutive day today amid fears of higher
interest rates, while the dollar rose slightly against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which lost 237.72 points
Monday, plunged an additional 327.08 points, or 0.88 percent,
closing at 36,895.52.
   Prices started lower today following Monday's decline and sank
further after the Bank of Japan announced a substantial increase in
the nation's money supply, seen as inflationary and likely to force
the bank to raise the official discount rate, an official of Nomura
Securities Co. said.
   The supply rose by 11.5 percent in January from a year earlier.
It was the second straight month of double-digit growth, and the
highest year-to-year increase since March 1988.
   Chris Schreiber, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said
the growth rate ``was way above what people were expecting. It's
definitely cause for concern. It's a very high level compared with
real economic growth.''
   A broker speaking on condition of anonymity said, ``The fact
that the Bank of Japan did not raise the discount rate right away
probably means that they will wait until mid-March to see what
long-term effects the last rise has.''
   The discount rate, the interest fee charged by the central bank
for loans to commercial banks, affects other interest rates. Higher
interest rates generally discourage stock investment.
   Meanwhile, the dollar closed at 144.50 yen, up 0.06 yen from
Monday's close of 144.52. It opened at 144.50 and ranged between
144.45 yen and 144.65 yen.
   Trading totaled $5.242 billion, down from $7 billion on Monday.
   An official at the Bank of Tokyo said the foreign exchange
market had expected the substiaial increase in the money supply.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk will
meet with at least five black African leaders this weekend in Zaire
in what may be a major breakthrough in African politics, officials
said today.
   In an effort to ease friction with black states, de Klerk will
meet Saturday in Zaire with the leaders of that country, Rwanda,
Burundi, Chad and the African Central Republic to discuss regional
issues and political developments in South Africa, said the
officials.
   Togo and Gabon may also be represented at the one-day meeting,
which would be the first multi-nation conference between South
Africa's white-minority government and black African states, said
the officials, who declined to be identified. South African
presidents have had meetings with single black heads-of-state in
the past.
   The meeting could clear the way for South Africa to start
establishing political and economic ties with black Africa after
years of being isolated because of its apartheid policies, the
officials said. South Africa wants to expand economic ties to help
stimulate its own economy, they said.
   De Klerk is expected to brief the black leaders on his recent
reforms, including the Feb. 11 release of Nelson Mandela and the
legalization of the African National Congress and other
anti-apartheid groups.
   De Klerk is seeking to end white minority rule and extend
political rights to South Africa's black majority but at the same
time retain some sort of veto power for whites.
   The Zaire meeting is expected to discuss efforts to end the
civil war in Angola. Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko has been
mediating between the Angolan government and the UNITA guerrilla
group headed by Jonas Savimbi.
   South African newspapers reported today that some black nations
may be considering establishing diplomatic ties with South Africa
as it moves to end white-minority rule. The reports, quoting
official sources, said South Africa expects to establish formal
relations with several black nations by the end of the year, but
did not say which ones.
   South Africa has full diplomatic relations with just one black
African nation, Malawi, and trade missions in Zimbabwe, Mozambique,
Swaziland and Lesotho. The reports did not say which nations might
extend diplomatic ties, but the Ivory Coast and Zaire reportedly
are considering such a move.
   In addition to Mobutu, de Klerk will meet Saturday with
President Hissen Habre of Chad; President Major Gen. Juvenal
Habyarimana of Rwanda; President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi; and
President Gen. Andre Kolingba of the Central African Republic.

   Members of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party's powerful

meetings this morning, clearing the way for Kaifu and party
powerbrokers to begin negotiations for the top Cabinet and party
posts.
   Party leaders also discussed strategies for battling the
opposition over taxes and the budget when Parliament convenes later
this month.
   Before Sunday's election for the lower house of Parliament,
Kaifu's position had appeared shaky.
   He has a weak personal power base in the party and there were
doubts about the Liberal Democrats' chances, tarnished as they were
by an influence-peddling scandal and an unpopular sales tax.
Pressed by reporters, he said he would resign, after just six
months in office, if the party failed to retain at least 257 of the
512 seats in the powerful lower house.
   But with 275 seats won in the election and 14 conservative
independents likely to join them later, the Liberal Democrats are
not far behind the 295 seats they held in the outgoing house.
   The leading opposition Socialists won 136 seats, up from 83.
   Though the combined opposition fell far short of ousting the
Liberal Democrats in the lower house, it holds a majority in the
upper house, which must give its assent to most bills passed by the
more powerful chamber.
   The lower house can name the prime minister, pass the budget and
approve treaties without upper house assent.
   Kaifu said the election result ``absolved'' the party of its
taint of scandal, and promptly declared that he would serve out his
two-year term as party president.
   ``We started when the party was said to be in the greatest
crisis since it was formed,'' Kaifu told reporters. ``The result of
the election is a vote of confidence of the people under the
constitution, and our government has passed it.'' The Liberal
Democrats have held power since 1955.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters today
that President Bush has congratulated Kaifu in a letter on the
election results.
   Bush's letter said he hoped both governments would continue to
cooperate closely in promoting their partnership.
   Analysts say Kaifu's staying power will face several tough tests
_ including how he deals with Japan's chronic trade surplus with
the United States _ in the coming months, and that it is possible
he might misstep and become vulnerable again.
   If he does, a more powerful figure within the Liberal Democratic
Party, former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, is widely thought to
be preparing to try to replace him.
   Kaifu, 59, became prime minister in August when the Liberal
Democrats were on the ropes after the resignations of two prime
ministers amid sex and money scandals and a big loss in the July
elections for the upper house. He came from a small faction in the
party, had no personal clout, and looked as if he could easily be
the scapegoat if anything went wrong.
   Kaifu's main opponent, Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi,
was also strengthened after Sunday's polling, and vowed to continue
her struggles against the governing party.
   She attributed the elections results to the Liberal Democrats'
backing by big business and their powerful political machines,
built up over more than three decades in power.
   Voters re-elected major Liberal Democrats tainted by the scandal
in which numerous politicians profited from cut-rate stocks in a
subsidiary of the business information firm Recruit Co.
   They included former Prime Ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone, 72, and
Noboru Takeshita, 65, as well as a handful of ex-Cabinet ministers.
   Nakasone ran as an independent.

<HEAD>Magistrate Rules Journalist's Death Homicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magistrate today ruled that homicide
was the cause of death of a Sri Lankan reporter for a foreign news
agency whose body washed ashore two days after he was abducted.
   Richard de Zoysa, 33, correspondent for the Rome-based Inter
Press Service was abducted Saturday from his Colombo home by six
armed men in a jeep normally used by police, his mother, Dr.
Manorami Saravanamuttu, told acting Magistrate Jinapriya Peduruhewa.
   De Zoysa, whose body washed ashore Monday at Moratuwa, 10 miles
south of Colombo, had two bullet wounds, one on the neck and the
other on his forehead, said Peduruhewa.
   He was the first journalist working for a foreign news agency to
be slain in Sri Lanka since ultra-nationalist Sinhalese revolted
against the Sinhalese-dominated government in 1987.
   Police said Monday they suspected he was abducted by Sinhalese
militants, who oppose the government for its offer of autonomy to
minority Tamils. But police today said they were unable to name a
particular group in the slaying.
   De Zoysa had written several articles on the Sinhalese uprising
for Sri Lankan newspapers.
   The family had said a military official initially told them de
Zoysa had been taken for questioning by the military, but later the
family was informed de Zoysa was not being held by the army.
   A senior Defense Ministry official on Monday also denied de
Zoysa was in military custody.
   ``I do not know why my son was killed,'' Mrs. Saravanamuttu told
reporters after the inquest.
   ``I am lucky my son was well known,'' she said. ``I was able to
see his body and will be able to bury him. There are hundreds of
other mothers whose sons just disappear and nothing heard after
that.''
   Authorities blamed Sinhalese extremists from the People's
Liberation Front for the killings of three employees of the
government-owned television station last year.
   At least 6,000 people have been killed in hit-and-run attacks by
the militants and retaliation by the police and army since the
uprising began.

<TEXT>
   A sheriff who commandeered a National
Guard armory to ease overcrowding at the county jail won initial
approval for the action from a judge.
   Superior Court Judge John F. Moriarty on Monday issued a
temporary restraining order prohibiting the state from evicting
Sheriff Michael Ashe and 15 prisoners from the armory.
   Moriarty also ordered armory commander Col. William Whitman to
give Ashe keys to the building's showers and kitchen. Ashe's
deputies have been transporting the prisoners to the Hampden County
jail for showers and food has been brought into the armory.
   Ashe also wants access to the armory telephone, said his lawyer,
Edward J. McDonough Jr.
   ``Our feeling is that what the sheriff has done is lawful,''
McDonough said. Ashe took over the armory ``to keep the peace in
Hampden County ... to keep sentenced convicts off the street.''
   McDonough said Ashe and state officials would appear in court
today to discuss a final solution to the conflict.
   Ashe's move was sparked by Westfield District Judge Philip
Contant's decision to detain two Hampden County deputies for five
hours after they refused to take a prisoner to the overcrowded
Jail, built to hold 279 inmates.
   A federal judge ordered that no more than 500 inmates may be
housed in the jail. That cap was exceeded this week, and sheriff's
spokesman Richard McCarthy said the usual remedies of early
release, late sentencing and housing prisoners elsewhere in
Massachusetts had not provided enough space.
   A new prison in nearby Ludlow has been approved but will take
two to three years to build.
   McCarthy blamed the jail space crisis on tougher sentencing laws
combined with the public's reluctance to finance jails or live near
them.
   ``My belief is that what we have in Hampden County is a real
perfect microcosm of the whole national dilemma,'' McCarthy said.
``There's no constituency for corrections. Liberals find it
distasteful and conservatives find any commitment of resources to
be coddling.''

   The dollar was lower in early European trading
today, and foreign currency dealers said they didn't expect much
movement until the U.S. market reopens after Monday's Presidents
Day holiday.
   Gold prices rose.
   ``It's all very trendless right now,'' said a currency trader at
a U.S. bank in Frankfurt. ``No one has any really good idea of the
direction.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar edged up 0.06 yen to a closing 144.58 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 145.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.6695 West German marks, down from 1.6765
   _ 1.4828 Swiss francs, down from 1.4885
   _ 5.6815 French francs, down from 5.6955

   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.7089, compared with $1.7030 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419.25 a troy ounce, up
from $416.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $419.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $419.00, up from $416.60 late
Monday.
   Bullion dealers said gold prices were pushed higher by a
combination of continued dollar buying and an expected bout of
buying by Japanese investors.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.26 to close at a bid $418.50.

<HEAD>Risk-Takers Most Effective School Leaders, Study Finds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Principals who broke traditions and ``refused
to let bureaucracy strangle innovation'' were able to build better
schools, a nationwide study concluded.
   Those principals also helped improve teacher and student
satisfaction, according to the report released Monday at the
National Association of Secondary School Principals' annual
convention.
   ``Good principals are like Tom Cruise in `Top Gun' _ they are on
the edge of what can be allowed out there. They're flying their
jets upside down,'' said Leonard Pellicer, a member of the
organization's study team that conducted the research.
   The study found a relationship between an individual school's
success _ measured by students' eagerness to learn and staff
satisfaction _ and the willingness of its principals and assistant
principals to gamble on new ideas. Faculty stability also was an
important factor.
   ``The more risks taken ... the better the outcomes,'' said the
97-page report, which examined the role of principals and their
assistants at 74 schools nationwide during 1988.
   ``Risk-taking behavior is probably necessary because of the
bureaucratic nature of schools and school districts. Principals
were regularly frustrated with their inability to deal with
problems unique to the local school,'' it said.
   ``They were forced to `go through channels.' The more successful
principals often bypassed the red tape or acted pending approval.
They simply refused to let bureaucracy strangle innovation.''
   According to the report, four factors critical to a school's
success were the degree of autonomy given the school by its
district; amount of authority vested in the principal; degree of
community support; and the competence, diversity and stability of
the school staff.
   In cases where principals met resistance from a district, they
sometimes exercised ``creative insubordination.''
   ``It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to ask permission,''
said Pellicer, director of the South Carolina Educational Policy
Center and an education professor at the University of South
Carolina.
   To deal with the disparate interests requires a principal who is
more than the disciplinarian of yesteryear.
   ``When we started out with education in America, we basically
brought kids to school and taught them reading, writing and
arithmetic. Now we transport them, we feed them, give them career
counseling, personal counseling. We discipline them, and develop
them socially. Everything is so much more complicated and it takes
a different kind of person to maintain a grasp of what's going
on,'' Pellicer said.
   Others on the study team were James Keefe, the director of
research for the Reston, Va.-based principals' association; Edgar
Kelley, a professor in the Department of Educational Leadership at
Western Michigan University; and Lloyd McCleary, a professor in the
Department of Educational Administration at the University of Utah.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Poles Oppose Reunified Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A poll taken in eight Eastern and Western European
countries indicates that only Poles fear the eventual reunification
of Germany.
   When asked if they favored or opposed to the reunification of
the two Germanys, 64 percent of Poles surveyed said they were
either somewhat opposed or very opposed, in the results published
in several newspapers Monday.
   Twenty-six percent said they were rather favorable or very
favorable.
   By contrast, of the seven other countries polled, opposition was
only 17 percent in West Germany, 6 percent in Spain, 23 percent in
France, 27 percent in Britain, 13 percent in Italy, 22 percent in
Hungary and 30 percent in the Soviet Union.
   Postwar II Poland includes some former German territory, while
it lost some of its own land to the Soviet Union.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has promised
that a unified Germany would not to lay claim to the lost
territory, but he and other German leaders oppose Poland's request
that it be granted a role with the four World War II Allies in the
reunification process.
   The survey was coordinated by France's CSA Institute polling
organization and involved a national sampling of people 18 years
old or more in all of the countries except the Soviet Union, where
the poll was carried out only in the Moscow region. In France,
1,024 people were questioned.
   Asked if they thought the evolution in Eastern Europe would
guarantee a period of peace; not really lessen the risks; or
possibly provoke a new world conflict; the Poles were the most wary
with 56 percent saying risks were not really lessened and 19
percent saying a new conflict was possible.
   The second most cautious were the French, 50 percent of whom
said the risks remained the same and 13 percent that conflict was
possible.
   Altogether, eight polling organizations took part in the survey.
The published poll provided no further details on how it was
conducted or the margin for error.

   Entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. is putting up a
tough fight in his battle with a recurrence of throat cancer, his
publicist said today, but she could not confirm a report that he
also fought pneumonia.
   The Daily News in New York, quoting an unidentified source,
reported today that the 64-year-old Davis developed pneumonia as a
complication to his cancer treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   The News said doctors were able to clear up the pneumonia
infection last week.
   Davis' publicist, Susan Reynolds, said she could not confirm the
report, and hospital spokesman Ron Wise said he also had no
information about it.
   The versatile singer-dancer, whose career has stretched from
poverty to the Las Vegas stage and motion pictures, was diagnosed
as having throat cancer in September and re-entered the hospital a
month ago after suffering a recurrence.
   ``He has been receiving treatment. He's able to walk around and
is in touch with friends and family,'' Reynolds said.
   Davis has been inundated with letters and flowers from fans
around the globe _ including a letter from Norway addressed simply,
``Sammy Davis Jr., USA,'' Ms. Reynolds said.

   The winter storm that struck the Southwest over the holiday
weekend moved eastward today with snow expected in southern
Colorado, the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico and the
Oklahoma-Texas panhandle. Strong northerly winds brought snow
squalls to parts of the Great Lakes and ushered arctic air into the
Northeast. Flurries and wind chills as cold as minus 60 were
expected.
   After several days of heavy rain that triggered severe flooding
across the Southeast, showers abated along the rain-swollen Gulf
Coast and the southern Atlantic Coast. But more rain was forecast
today for the Florida peninsula, and for the Southeast later in the
week.
   In the Pacific Northwest, rain fell along the coast and snow was
expected in higher elevations of the Cascade Mountains.
   In the Southwest, New Mexico's mountains looked for 8 to 16
inches of fresh snowfall by late today A winter storm watch was
posted for the state's middle and upper Rio Grande Valley.
   Colorado expected another 5 to 10 inches of snow in the Sangre
de Cristo Mountains. Snow advisories were called for the San Juan
Mountains and the Four Corners area.
   Up to 15 inches of snow in the Texas Panhandle was possible by
Wednesday morning.
   Humid gulf air should mix with the storm front to spawn rain
Wednesday in east Texas and Louisiana.
   The holiday weekend storm in the Southwest left Williams, Ariz.,
under 22 inches of snow and Flagstaff beneath 18 inches. The Grand
Canyon's southern rim received 17 inches.
   Snow fell today in the lower Great Lakes, northern New England
and upstate New York.
   Lows of about 15 below and wind chills as cold as minus 60 were
expected tonight in northern Maine.
   The temperature in Reno, Nev., fell Monday to a record low of 7
below, breaking the 87-year-mark by 14 degrees.
   Other record lows for the date included 39 in Oakland, Calif.,
and 33 in San Jose, Calif.
   Tucson, Ariz., received six-tenths of an inch of snow Monday for

<TEXT>
   Civil defense officials have an
around-the-clock watch on a lava flow from the Kilauea Volcano that
is threatening to overrun a 125-home residential area.
   Another lava flow from the volcano already has destroyed one
home and threatened four others.
   Residents of the Kalapana subdivision met with Hawaii County
officials Monday to discuss evacuation procedures as lava came
within three-quarters of a mile of the development, said Bruce
Butts, assistant administrator of Hawaii Island Civil Defense.
   ``We're in a wait-and-see pattern to see what direction the flow
will take,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, a separate flow from the volcano that toppled an
abandoned home Saturday went around a second home Monday but
continued to pose a threat to the four remaining homes in the
isolated Royal Gardens subdivision, said Butts.
   Kilauea has claimed 75 homes in Royal Gardens and the
neighboring communities of Kalapana and Kapa`ahu since the eruption
began Jan. 3, 1983.
   Jack Minassian, fire management officer at Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park, said Monday the flow forced the evacuation of two
residents by helicopter on Sunday.
   Royal Gardens was composed of 1,500 one-acre lots sold in the
1970s. About 60 homes were built. More than half of the homes have
been destroyed.
   Kilauea has caused more than $20 million in damage since the
eruption began. It has engulfed 2{ miles of roads, two miles of
water lines and two miles of utility lines.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain today pressed fellow European
Community members to drop the wealthy trading bloc's ban on new
investment in South Africa, hinting that it might otherwise lift
the embargo unilaterally.
   But as the meeting began in the medieval Dublin Castle, Irish
sources suggested that as a compromise, the community could send a
fact-finding team to South Africa to determine whether the
white-led government's reform program warrants easing the embargoes.
   The team would likely consist of officials from France, Ireland
and Italy _ possessors of the past, present and next European
Community presidents, the sources said. The presidency of the
12-nation organization rotates every six months.
   Earlier, Irish officials said British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd appeared isolated in his demand for an immediate easing of
sanctions.
   The community's Commissioner for External Relations, Frans
Andriessen, added in an Irish Radio interview that the one-day
meeting ``will not be easy. But there might be much more
understanding than people believe there to be.''
   The foreign ministers also were expected to focus on rapid moves
toward German unification. Ireland announced last week that it
would call a special European Community summit in April because of
the pace of developments.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, the West's most
outspoken opponent of sanctions against South Africa, argues that
the community's relatively mild embargoes should be lifted
gradually to reward the white-led government's reforms.
   She also says that unless South Africa's president, F.W. de
Klerk, can show some international response to his legalizing of
the African National Congress and release of Nelson Mandela this
month, he may be toppled by a white backlash.
   Mrs. Thatcher unilaterally lifted academic and cultural
restrictions when de Klerk announced his reforms this month. She
moved again, saying Britain would encourage such contacts, when ANC
leader Mandela was released Feb. 11.
   Apart from Britain, the community includes three of South
Africa's other major trading partners: West Germany, Italy and
France.
   Hurd, in angry exchanges with opposition legislators in the
British Parliament last week, said that if there is no agreement in
Dublin, ``the government must reserve its right to act on its own
if necessary.''
   Mrs. Thatcher has said she will not drop unilaterally binding
embargoes agreed on by the community in 1986. They consist mainly
of bans on the imports of iron, steel and Krugerrand gold coins.
   Other, non-binding embargoes, which Mrs. Thatcher wants lifted
quickly, are bans on the promotion of tourism, on new government
loans to South African agencies and state funding of trade missions
to South Africa.
   Britain has been at the center of fierce disputes over South
African sanctions at meetings of the Commonwealth, the largely
Third World association of Britain and its former colonies.
   The community, however, showed little enthusiasm for tightening
embargoes after 1986 and its measures are far less comprehensive
than those imposed by the United States.
   In the past two years, South African exports to the European
Community have more than doubled to nearly $15 billion.
   International Monetary Fund statistics show West Germany is
South Africa's largest trading partner, followed by Japan, Britain,
the United States, Italy and France.
   Mandela, who has called for continued embargoes until apartheid
is dismantled, said from his home in Soweto Monday that Britain's
policy on sanctions was of ``primary importance.''
   He said he planned to telephone Mrs. Thatcher about it after
putting an undisclosed plan to fellow leaders of the ANC.

   Police continued to search today for a gunman
who strode into an office at the UCLA Medical Center and opened
fire, killing one employee and seriously wounding a second.
   The motive and identity of the killer remained a mystery, but
police said he appeared to know his way around the labyrinthine
medical center and seemed to have ``knowledge of a victim and a
room.''
   The shooting occurred in the hospital's patient-escort dispatch
office at 5:40 a.m. Monday. The office is away from patient rooms
in an area where laboratories and other offices are located.
   Diondra Ann Picou, 22, of Gardena, died of multiple gunshots to
the chest and Norma S. Arellano, 30, of Los Angeles, underwent
surgery for multiple gunshot wounds and was in serious condition.
   Police said the gunman, carrying a large caliber handgun, opened
an unlocked door to the office and opened fire.
   ``The suspect had a pretty good knowledge of where that
particular room is located. We don't think this was a random
incident,'' said police Lt. Ron Hall.
   Ms. Picou, who had worked as a patient escort for six months,
was struck in the chest as she sat at a table. Arellano, a 10-year
medical center employee, was shot several times in the leg and
torso, Hall said.
   Ms. Arellano managed to telephone a co-worker, who summoned
campus police, Hall said. UCLA campus police were able to question
Arellano before she was taken into surgery, he said.
   Access to the hospital is restricted from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. and
employees must show identification badges to guards before
entering. But the restrictions are lifted at 5 a.m., said hospital
spokesman Rich Elbaum.
   UCLA campus police, who also were investigating, refused to
comment on the shooting.

   Leaking gas from a steel works furnace
erupted in a fireball today, injuring 14 workers, two seriously,
police said.
   The plant, at Port Kembla on the east coast of New South Wales
state, sustained minimal damage, said a spokesman for BHP, which
operates the facility.
   Police and hospital officials said most of the injured were hurt
by flying glass while walking on a road outside the coke oven.
   BHP officials determined leaking gas was the cause of the blast
and said they expected operations to resume later in the day. An
explosion at the Port Kembla plant in 1975 killed three people.

   The grounding of three cargo ships
along the stretch of coral reefs off the Florida Keys has led to an
agreement by owners of 60 oil tankers to keep six miles away from
the fragile reefs.
   Fifteen of the nation's largest oil companies agreed Monday to
put more distance between their tankers and the 200-mile-long
barrier reefs to guard against grounding and oil spills, said Gov.
Bob Martinez.
   ``The coral reefs will be a much safer place,'' Martinez told
reporters. There were no spills from the three groundings last fall.
   Some 60 tankers regularly transit the Straits and about 250
other vessels occasionally passing through will stay outside the
buffer zone. Some tankers carry as much as 21 million gallons of
cargo.
   The agreement, which takes effect April 1, will increase the
cost of traveling the route, said Amoco Transport Co. President Ed
Roland, but the buffer zone will give cleanup crews considerably
more time to contain a spill.
   He could not estimate the extra costs. Roland, who is chairman
of the Marine Transportation Committee of the American Petroleum
Institute, called the agreement ``a major step in further
safeguarding the southern Florida environment.''
   Under the agreement, the ships will stay 10 nautical miles, or
12 statute miles, from the shoreline and five nautical miles, or
six statute miles, from the edge of the shallow reefs.
   Ships sailing from the Atlantic Ocean into the Gulf of Mexico
often hug the corral banks to avoid the strong, fuel-eating
currents of the Gulf Stream.
   ``Twenty-five percent of the (tanker) traffic will be more
seaward than it is today,'' Martinez said.

   Rock-throwing protesters demanding greater
democracy battled club-wielding riot police around the Legislature
today, burning police vans and smashing windows. At least 80 people
were injured, authorities said.
   The violence broke out after about 1,000 demonstrators gathered
outside the Legislature to harass aging lawmakers of the governing
Nationalist Party entering the building to elect a new speaker of
the Legislature.
   The demonstrators, mostly supporters of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, demanded that the aging politicians,
who last faced election on the Chinese mainland more than 40 years
ago and dominate the assembly, be replaced by Taiwan-elected
lawmakers.
   Police said the clash erupted when police tried to disperse
protesters who battered a taxi they suspected of carrying an
elderly legislator.
   Police said protesters burned two police vans, damaged 10
others, overturned six police cars and smashed several cars
carrying the elderly lawmakers.
   Chiang Kung-liang, a 77-year-old legislator, fainted in the
chamber and was rushed to a hospital for intensive care.
   Riot police, numbering more than 2,000, swung clubs and shields
to break up the crowd, which fought back with rocks and placards.
Police arrested three men, blood streaming down their faces, and
later released them.
   The two-hour clash ended when an additional 500 riot police
backed by water cannon arrived at the legislature.
   Police said about 50 policemen were injured by rocks thrown by
the demonstrators, and about 30 protesters were also wounded in the
clashes. Officials of the opposition party said at least five
demonstrators were hospitalized with head injuries.
   Inside the building, 21 Democratic Progressive Party legislators
raised procedural issues during a 10-hour debate, forcing the
election of the speaker to be postponed a week.
   The Nationalist Party, whose members control the assembly, has
nominated veteran politician Liang Shu-jung, 69, to be the speaker
in an attempt to appease old guard conservatives in the party.
   The opposition party has 21 of the 283 seats in the Legislature,
while 143 legislators were elected in China before the Nationalist
government fled to Taiwan in 1949 upon losing a civil war to
Communist forces.
   They have been frozen in office in support of the Nationalist
claim to still be the legitimate ruler of all China.

<TEXT>
   A $33.1 million out-of-court lawsuit
settlement will be shared by the families of most of those who died
or were injured in the 1988 collapse of a Brownsville department
store, attorneys said.
   The three-story Amigo Store came crashing down the afternoon of
July 7, 1988, during a torrential thunderstorm in the border city,
killing 14 and injuring several dozen others.
   Many of those injured or killed were from Matamoros, Mexico,
just across the Rio Grande from downtown Brownsville.
   John Lewis, a lawyer who represented plaintiffs suing on behalf
of families of four of the dead and four of the injured, said a
committee of plaintiffs' lawyers arrived at the agreement Monday
with the last of nine defendants.
   The case had not gone to trial. Litigation was still in the
discovery phase in which investigators review evidence and
witnesses give depositions, Lewis said.
   Monday's settlement was for the families of 13 who died and 32
who were injured, according to attorney Mark Cantu, who also
represented some of the plaintiffs. Others among the injured have
reached independent settlements, Cantu said. The family of one of
the dead did not sue, he added.
   Defendants included Amigo Stores Inc., Brownsville's Public
Utilities Board, the city of Brownsville, and several construction
companies and materials suppliers, Cantu said.
   The store site is now a parking lot.
   The defendants' insurance companies have agreed to pay varying
amounts, depending on the percentage of liability attributed to
them in the settlement, Cantu said. The amounts range from $100,000
to $10 million, he said.
   Attorneys for the defendants were not in their offices late
Monday and could not be reached for comment.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney flew here today for
talks aimed at boosting Japan's financial support for American
forces stationed in Japan, as Philippines President Corazon Aquino
signaled a new willingness to discuss differences over compensation
for U.S. bases in her country.
   ``The Japanese are very understanding and are very willing to
help us as much as they can,'' said a Pentagon official traveling
with Cheney, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The official said that in his three days of talks, Cheney did
not intend to deal in specific figures with the Japanese, who each
year provide around $2.4 billion of the $7 billion it costs to base
50,000 U.S. troops here.
   However, he said, ``We're confident they understand our
requirements ... we're hopeful that over the years, we'll see a
sizeable increase in Japanese support for U.S. forces here.''
   Cheney, on a two-week tour that also took him to Hawaii, South
Korea and Hong Kong, arrived in Tokyo from Clark Air Base in the
Philippines, stopping briefly on the Japanese island of Okinawa to
tour American bases.
   Mrs. Aquino had snubbed Cheney during his two-day visit to the
Philippines, but she sounded a more concilatory note in a statement
issued as the defense secretary ended his visit.
   ``I welcome the statement of support for this government and
Philippine democracy made by Secretary Cheney on behalf of the
United States,'' she said.
   ``I also welcome his reiteration that the United States will
make its best efforts to meet its pledge for foreign assistance,''
she added, referring to the $96 million shortfall in the $481
million in aid the Bush administration promised for the use of six
military bases.
   Mrs. Aquino said the problem ``appears to be with the U.S.
Congress and its funding priorities. But we are as ready as the
Americans to discuss these difficulties in sincerity and good
faith.''
   Talks on the future of the bases, whose lease expires in
September 1991, are expected to begin in April.
   Columnist Manuel Martinez wrote in the independent newspaper The
Manila Times today that Americans were exploiting the Philippines.
   ``When you think of your visit here, Mr. Cheney, remember you
are coming to a country whom you massively looted and maimed and
occupied,'' Martinez said. ``And what do you do to the ordinary
Filipino? You destabilize his democratic government. You bamboozle
his lady president. You wring his neck with foreign debts.''
   On Monday, Cheney met with Philippine defense officials angry
over what they believe is American failure to honor commitments
made in 1988 to maintain the bases.
   Cheney told them the United States will abandon its bases in the
Philippines if it finds that keeping them is too expensive or that
Americans are unwelcome.
   The United States ``will stay only as long as the Philippine
people wish it to stay _ and only if the terms negotiated are
acceptable to both parties,'' Cheney told reporters after the
meeting.
   Mrs. Aquino was so upset over the cut in U.S. aid made by
Congress that she announced before Cheney began his trip that she
would not see him, leaving that task to her defense minister, Fidel
Ramos.
   Security was tight during the brief visit to Clark Air Base,
where Cheney inspected U.S. military aircraft. Last September,
communist rebels killed two American civilian employees of Camp
O'Donnell, about 15 miles north of the base, on the day Vice
President Dan Quayle arrived in Manila.
   On Monday, about 300 leftists clashed with police during a
demonstration at the base demanding that Clark and the five other
U.S. bases be closed. Police also dispersed about 200 protesters in
front of the U.S. Embassy in Manila.
   ``We recognize there is a shortfall of $96 million over what we
had anticipated,'' Cheney said after meeting with Ramos. ``I also
pointed out that in East Asia, in this part of the world, the
United States provided a little over $600 million, and about $500
million of that comes specifically to the Philippines.''
   An influential Filipino minority is pressuring Mrs. Aquino not
to renew the agreement. In addition, leading Filipino congressmen
have urged her to postpone those discussions until this year's cuts
are restored.
   There are about 18,000 U.S. military personnel in the
Philippines, plus 20,000 dependents.
   Ramos acknowledged that the Bush administration needs
congressional approval for aid commitments but said he had told
Cheney that ``time is of the essence'' in meeting current U.S.
obligations. The secretary said Ramos had been ``very direct and
very forthright'' in presenting his government's position.
   Asked whether he could say that his government wanted the base
to remain, Ramos declined to answer the question, saying the issue
was under discussion in the Philippine Congress.
   U.S. war jets from Clark flew air cover for government forces
during the coup attempt, and it is widely believed the move was
decisive in crushing the rebellion.
   Cheney, who heads back to Washington on Saturday, is touring the
Asian nations with U.S. bases in preparation for an April 1
assessment he is to give Congress on the nation's military posture
in the Pacific.
   He has been telling officials in each nation that there is a
limit to the Pentagon pocketbook and that budget pressures may
force 10 percent to 12 percent cutbacks in U.S. military forces
based in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.

   Africa must face the future
expecting less economic aid as the West turns its attention toward
Eastern Europe, Africa's foreign ministers were told today.
   ``The rapid changes in Eastern Europe have drastically altered
the political thinking and strategic considerations of the West,''
said Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organization of
African Unity.
   ``The need for our economic unity is made all the more urgent in
the face of the shift of priority by the West to Eastern Europe,''
he told the ministers, who met on the second day of their annual
five-day conference.
   Abebayo Adedeji, executive secretary of the U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa, also urged the foreign ministers to prepare
for the future.
   ``We should be ready for a new political world map and we should
be prepared to fit into that new map, not as a residual component
but as a full and essential part of it,'' he said.
   Some African leaders have expressed concern that Western nations
would abandon the continent and divert aid they previously gave
Africans to Eastern Europe, where Communist hard-liners have been
replaced by reformist leaders.
   Another item on the agenda is political changes in South Africa,
where President F.W. De Klerk recently legalized the African
National Congress and freed prison Nelson Mandela, the best known
of the liberation movement's leaders.

   Cubans would rather eat grass than
McDonald's hamburgers to preserve the purity of their Communist
revolution, a Cuban diplomat was quoted as saying today.
   ``We don't have McDonald's in Cuba, but nobody's starving,''
Ambassador Elises Estrada Lescaille said in today's editions of the
daily newspaper Horizons. ``We'll eat grass, if necessary, to
defend our revolution.''
   Lescaille appeared to be referring to the recent opening of a
McDonald's restaurant in Moscow. The hamburger chain's Big Macs and
fries were well-received by Muscovites.
   Relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union have grown strained
in recent months as President Fidel Castro insists on retaining the
hard-line communism rejected by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Perestroika, Gorbachev's program of restructuring Soviet
political and economic life, ``cannot be applied in all
countries,'' Lescaille told the newspaper.
   ``The problem with the U.S.S.R. isn't with the Communist Party
or the government but with the forces that have sprung up along
with perestroika,'' he said.
   The Cuban ambassador said it was possible that Moscow could
renege on its aid agreement with the Castro government in 1990, but
that so far all pledges had been fulfilled, the newspaper reported.
   Cuba is heavily dependent on Soviet economic aid and there have
been signs the $5 billion in annual assistance is being pared.
   Lescaille said Cuba enjoys good relations with China and praised
the late Communist Party chairman Mao Tse-Tung as ``a great
leader,'' the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 students marched in the
streets of the capital today and hijacked two buses to demand an
impartial investigation into the slaying of Kenya's foreign
minister, police said.
   The demonstration came a day after the government issued its
first detailed report on the death of the minister, Robert Ouko,
and announced two British detectives and a pathologist were joining
the investigation.
   The students, from the University of Nairobi and Kenyatta
University, were demonstrating for a fourth day.
   The protesters carried green branches and chanted ``Who killed
Bob?'' ``No cover-up!'' and ``We want justice!'' They taunted
police with shouts of ``Where were you?''
   Police on Friday discovered Ouko's partially burned body in the
brush, about four miles from his family farm in Koru, near Lake
Victoria in western Kenya. He had been missing for four days.
   The students _ estimated by one police officer to number 1,000 _
gathered today around the statue of Kenya's first president after
independence, Jomo Kenyatta, in the heart of the capital.
   They then marched past government offices and demanded that
Hezekiah Oyugi, the permanent secretary in the Office of the
President, resign. Oyugi is in charge of internal security.
   The students commandeered two buses, which were driven to Ouko's
suburban Nairobi residence.
   The British investigation team comprises Superintendent John
Troon and Inspector Graham Dennis of Scotland Yard and Dr. Ian
West, the government said late Monday.
   The move was seen in part as a government attempt to allay fears
of a cover-up. Since Kenya gained independence, the murders of
three prominent politicians have gone unsolved and the former
Kenyatta government was accused of covering them up.
   Scotland Yard is the commonly used name for the London police.
Kenya is a former British colony and its security personnel
continue to receive training from Britons.
   Ouko disappeared one week ago, apparently without telling
colleagues or family members. His disappearance was reported two
days later.
   The government on Monday said pathologists found a bullet hole
in the 58-year-old minister's head.
   In a statement, it said police also found a .38-caliber revolver
near Ouko's right hand, and the Central Firearms Bureau, which
licenses guns, identified the weapon as belonging to the minister.
   Near his body, police also found a gas can and a plastic bag
containing a pair of jeans, a shirt, and a leather jacket. The
jacket pockets contained four bullets and Kenyan currency
equivalent to $18.
   The clothes were identified as belonging to Ouko, and a storeman
said the gas can resembled one previously stored at the minister's
home, the statement said.
   Ouko was considered one of the most articulate and able members
of President Daniel arap Moi's Cabinet. He first served as
permanent secretary in the Foreign Ministry in 1963 when Kenya
gained independence from Britain.
   Ouko later held other high-ranking government jobs before being
tapped by Moi to head the Foreign Ministry in 1979.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's U.S. ambassador,
acknowledging Jewish concerns about German reunification, told
American Jewish leaders that Germans would stand up against any
violations of human rights.
   But Monday's speech by Ambassador Jurgen Ruhfus met a skeptical
response and repeated questions about what a new German state would
do to ensure that centuries-old conflicts among Christians, Jews
and Moslems would not explode.
   ``There is no guarantee,'' Ruhfus told about 500 delegates
Monday at the national convention of the American Jewish Congress.
   ``But I can from my deepest convictions say that you can trust
us,'' he said, prompting groans from the crowd in a hotel meeting
room. ``You can count on Germans to stand up against any
infringement of human rights.''
   It was Ruhfus' first public address to a Jewish audience since
serious discussions began of a union of East and West Germany. The
ambassador said Germans have worked for four decades to ensure Nazi
atrocities won't be repeated.
   The German state, he added, would be accountable not to
nationalism but to a new European federation based on individual
freedoms and human rights.
   ``We Germans are aware that a Germany growing together will be
viewed in part with concern, with considerable concern,'' he said.
``We are convinced that this fear is unjustified.''
   Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish
Congress, said afterward that Jewish concerns in the aftermath of
the Holocaust ``are not easily susceptible to dissipation by some
simple, even rational, political formula.''
   However, he added, ``To the extent that a Jewish audience can be
reassured that the German political leaders understand their
concerns ... the ambassador's presentation was extremely
well-received and considered reassuring.''
   Ruhfus said West Germany has accepted responsibility for the
Hitler era deaths of some 12 million people, including 6 million
Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
   ``I understand the feelings of those who have suffered,'' Ruhfus
said. ``If we want to shape the future, we must be aware of the
past.''

   The Supreme Court today allowed the federal
government to withhold highway funds from states that do not comply
with a national speed limit.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Nevada
officials who want to set the speed limit at 70 mph on some state
highways.
   Congress established a 55 mph national speed limit in 1973 in
response to the Arab oil embargo. The law was aimed at conserving
oil, although it also was endorsed as a safety measure.
   The limit was raised to 65 mph in 1987 for rural highways. That
move blunted most protests, primarily from Western states, over the
55 mph limit.
   The 1987 law affects about three-fourths of the 43,000-mile
interstate system, and makes another 7,000 miles of federal, state
and local highways eligible for the 65 mph limit.
   Most states raised the speed limit to 65 mph on affected rural
roads after Congress allowed it.
   The Nevada Legislature in 1985 increased the state's limit to 70
mph, and in 1986 that limit was posted on a 33-mile stretch of
Interstate 80. But the higher speed limit was withdrawn when
federal officials threatened to cut off highway aid to the state.
   Nevada officials then sued in federal court, saying the state
had no real choice but to comply with the national speed limit
because otherwise it would lose about 95 percent of its highway
funds.
   The state officials said the national limit violates the
Constitution by coercing compliance by the states.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August rejected the
state's arguments.
   ``The impropriety of making judicial judgments regarding a
state's financial capabilities renders the coercion theory highly
suspect,'' the appeals court said.
   It noted that Nevada, one of several states with no income tax,
could increase its tax revenue to make up for a cut-off in federal
funds.
   Moreover, the appeals court said, Congress could order states to
adhere to a national speed limit _ not merely cut off funds for
non-compliance.
   The appeals court relied in part on a 1987 Supreme Court ruling
that upheld a federal law threatening to reduce highway aid to
states that refused to adopt a minimum drinking age of 21.
   The case is Nevada vs. Skinner, 89-686.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Hear Colorado Appeal In Drug Case</HEAD>

   Colorado lost a high-stakes fight today with
the federal government over money and other property seized from
drug traffickers as the Supreme Court refused to hear the state's
appeal.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
proceeds of drug transactions automatically are forfeited to the
federal government. In the case that had been appealed, the
government later transferred nearly all the money to local police
departments.
   The case involved $1.5 million in cash and gold bars. Colorado
Attorney General Duane Woodward had contended that a state's claim
on such money and property to satisfy owed taxes sometimes should
take precedence.
   Police in Lakewood, Colo., seized the cash and 12 gold bars from
the home of Albert and Victoria Levy during a Nov. 21, 1982 search.
The money and gold were the proceeds of a cocaine deal.
   The next month, state tax authorities assessed taxes totaling
$194,000 against Albert Levy based on alleged narcotics sales of
almost $3 million in 1982.
   A state judge, ruling on a tax lien imposed, said the money
could come from the seized proceeds.
   Federal authorities, meanwhile, went into a federal court in
Denver seeking forfeiture of the seized loot. They said a 1978 law
gave the federal government a superior claim to the proceeds
because forfeiture dates back to the commission of the crime.
   U.S. District Judge John Kane Jr. ruled that part of the state's
tax lien should be paid from the cocaine deal proceeds, but Justice
Department lawyers appealed his ruling.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last April 21 reversed
Judge Kane's ruling, and ordered that all the proceeds be forfeited
to the federal government.
   The appeals court ruled that the 1978 law permits a federal
claim to seized drug-trafficking proceeds at the time a crime was
committed, which always will come before a state's attempt to
attach a tax lien.
   In the state's appeal, Woodward said the appeals court ruling
unduly interferes with state taxing powers. The appeal also argued
that the federal forfeiture law was ``permissive,'' not mandatory.
   Bush administration lawyers urged the court to reject the
state's appeal, noting that Congress in 1984 amended the law to say
explicitly that ``the interest of the United States vests at the
time of the act giving rise to the forfeiture.''
   They argued also that the forfeiture law is mandatory.
   Last October, Judge Kane ordered the cash and gold bars released
to the federal government. Last Dec. 7, U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh authorized transfer of about 90 percent of the forfeited
property's value to five police and sheriff's departments in
Colorado.
   The Lakewood Police Department received the bulk, 63 percent, of
the revenue-sharing transfer.
   The case is Colorado v. U.S., 89-699.

<HEAD>Apartment Owner, Manager Settle Discrimination Lawsuit for
$450,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners and managers of an apartment
complex have agreed to pay a record $450,000 to settle a lawsuit
accusing them of discriminating against blacks, attorneys said.
   The out-of-court agreement, made Friday but announced Monday,
followed an undercover investigation by a housing rights group and
is one of the largest ever in a housing discrimination case.
   ``Racial discrimination is still a very entrenched problem in
this country,'' said Patrick O. Patterson, an attorney for the
plaintiffs. ``If you looked at the evidence in this case, attitudes
that many people hoped would have been gone years ago are very much
present.''
   Until a 1988 amendment to the federal Fair Housing Act, punitive
damages in such cases were limited to $1,000.
   The largest previous settlement in a housing discrimination case
was $375,000 in a New York case which was appealed after a jury
awarded $500,000 to the plaintiffs, according to the NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund.
   In addition to the money, the defendants agreed to open the
apartment complex to black residents, and the percentage of black
renters has increased from 2 percent to 17 percent, Patterson said.
   The dispute began in October 1987 when Allan Lopez, 29, who is
black, was refused permission to share the apartment of Robert
Patrick O. Beaumont, 31, who is white.
   Managers at the Belford Park Apartments had Lopez fill out a
rental application, then rejected him on grounds of his credit
history, Patterson said.
   Many of the white tenants either had significantly worse credit
histories than Lopez or were not required to fill out rental
applications, the attorney said.
   The non-profit Westside Fair Housing Council sent three
undercover investigators to the apartment complex to pose as
prospective tenants.
   A black investigator was told there were no vacancies, while the
two white investigators were told units were available, Patterson
said.
   Lawsuits were filed in federal and state court against Los
Angeles-based Westchester Investment Co., which owned the complex,
Gutweiler-Woolley Properties, which managed it at the time, and a
couple who were the on-site managers.
   The owners and mangers were not available for comment. Phone
messages left with Westchester Investment's answering service were
not returned, and there was no listing for Gutweiler-Woolley. The
couple who managed the complex have moved out of state.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Hear Appeal in Pizza Connection Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by a man convicted in the so-called pizza connection case in
which prosecutors said tons of imported heroin and cocaine were
distributed through a network of pizza parlors.
   The court, without comment, let stand the conviction and 30-year
prison sentence of Filippo Casamento, who said he was only a
peripheral figure in the drug ring.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October upheld the
convictions of Casamento and 14 other men convicted in 1987 in New
York City after a 17-month trial, one of the longest and costliest
in history.
   Federal prosecutors said the drug ring brought narcotics valued
at $1.6 billion into the country from Turkey, Sicily and Brazil.
   All told, there were 21 defendants and numerous charges of
conspiracy, racketeering, money laundering and other offenses on
three continents dating back to the 1970s. Not all those convicted
appealed to the 2nd Circuit court.
   In the appeal acted on today, Casamento's lawyers described him
as a ``small fish caught up in a flood of evidence concerning Mafia
wrongdoing and international narcotics dealings.''
   They said his rights were violated because he was not tried
separately.
   The 2nd Circuit court said that while it had misgivings about
the length and complexity of the trial and the number of
defendants, the rights of the accused were not violated.
   The appeals court also suggested some new guidelines, including
possibly limiting the number of defendants if a joint trial is
expected to last more than four months.
   As for Casamento, the appeals court said there was sufficient
evidence for the jury to conclude he engaged in illegal drug deals.
   The leading defendants in the case were Gaetano Badalamenti,
reputed former head of the Mafia in Sicily, and Salvatore Catalano,
the ring's reputed New York boss. Both were sentenced to 45 years
in prison.
   The case is Casamento vs. U.S., 89-1178.

<TEXT>
   Spike Lee may have been wearing a
Georgetown University cap and sweatshirt, but he got a far warmer
reception from Syracuse University students than he did from
Academy Award voters.
   In a lecture and question-and-answer session Monday, Lee
shrugged off the academy's icy treatment of his latest movie, ``Do
the Right Thing,'' and blamed it on generational politics.
   The 1989 film, widely hailed by critics, received only two
Academy Award nominations, and isn't being considered for best
picture or best director.
   The academy's membership consists mainly of ``old people,'' the
32-year-old Lee said. He said they were ``a lot more comfortable
with the black chauffeur in `Driving Miss Daisy''' than with the
angry characters in his film.
   ``I still feel we made the best film of the year,'' he said.
Asked if racism might have been involved in the academy
nominations, Lee replied, ``Racism's involved in everything.''
   Despite the cap and sweatshirt, Syracuse students welcomed him
as one of their own.
   ``He's an African-American, one of the first ones to make it (as
a producer and director), and he's addressing the issues and
concerns affecting our community,'' Syracuse senior Deron Harris
said. ``That's why we're so proud of him.''

<HEAD>Protection Of Government Workers In Sex Abuse Cases Stands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that shields government social workers from being sued for placing
children in foster homes where they are sexually abused.
   The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal
appeals court ruling that the social workers enjoy absolute
immunity if their child-placement decisions were approved by a
court.
   In a decision that set a legal precedent for nine Western
states, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said social workers
in such cases share the absolute immunity that shields judges,
prosecutors and others in judicial proceedings.
   The scope of such judicial immunity was the sole issue before
the high court in a case from Washington state.
   The justices last October let stand a different federal appeals
courts ruling in a Maryland case that children who are abused by
foster parents may not sue the government social workers who placed
them in those homes.
   In that case, the appeals court did not rely on immunity.
Instead, it ruled that child abuse by foster parents is private,
not governmental, violence.
   The Supreme Court last year ruled that public officials may not
be sued in federal court when their alleged gross negligence
permits a child to be abused by a parent _ what the court called
``private violence.''
   That decision said a state has no constitutional duty to protect
people, including abused children, who are not in the state's
custody. But it left undecided whether a constitutional duty exists
to protect children from foster parents chosen by government
officials.
   In the case acted on today, two caseworkers with the Washington
Department of Social and Health Services were sued by three sisters
who said they were repeatedly raped, sodomized and sexually
assaulted by their foster father over an 18-month period in 1982-83.
   The girls were ages six, eight and 12 when the attacks allegedly
began.
   The foster father, Lee Michael, subsequently was convicted of
statutory rape and indecent liberties. He is serving a 55-year
prison sentence.
   Michael was the girls' uncle. The girls' mother, who committed
suicide in 1978, was a sister to Michael's wife.
   The girls' civil rights lawsuit named social workers Wanda Tyler
and Mark Bronson as defendants. The suit alleged that the social
workers had violated the girls' interest in being free from harm
while in state custody.
   Ms. Tyler in the spring of 1982 placed one of the girls, all of
whom were then residing with their father's parents in Richland,
Wash., with Michael. Bronson, who took over the case from Ms.
Tyler, placed the two other girls with Michael shortly thereafter.
   A federal trial judge refused to dismiss the suit, but the 9th
Circuit court reversed that ruling last Sept. 6.
   Finding the social workers' role to be an integral one in the
judicial process, the appeals court said they are entitled to
absolute immunity.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the girls noted that
most foster care placements are court-approved and involve periodic
court reviews. Federal law bars states from obtaining federal
reimbursement for foster care if the placements are not
court-approved.
   The appeals court ruling is binding law in Washington, Arizona,
Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and Oregon.
   The case is Babcock vs. Tyler, 89-912.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling Limiting Authors' Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a ruling
that drastically limits the right of authors to quote unpublished
material such as diaries and letters.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by a
company that published a biography attacking the late L. Ron
Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a ruling last April
that was denounced by scholars, publishers and free-speech
advocates, imposed strict limits on the use of quotations from
unpublished material.
   The appeals court said federal copyright law generally bars use
of such material without permission. The appeals court rejected
arguments that the ban violates constitutionally protected free
expression.
   The April ruling relied, in part, on an earlier 2nd Circuit
court decision barring Random House from publishing a biography of
author J.D. Salinger unless quotations from, and paraphrases of,
Salinger's letters were deleted.
   Because of a technicality, the appeals court refused to block
further publication of the Hubbard biography, entitled ``Bare-Faced
Messiah.'' The appeals court said the copyright owners, who are
affiliated with the Scientologists, waited too long to seek a court
order blocking publication.
   Ironically, that made Henry Holt and Co., publisher of the
biography, the technical winner before the appeals court.
   The company, nonetheless, filed the appeal acted on today. The
appeal argued that Holt suffered damages because U.S. publication
of ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' was blocked for nearly a year before the
appeals court ruled.
   Moreover, the company said the principle is of overriding
importance. It called the April ruling a grave threat to the
publishing industry because the 2nd Circuit court is based in New
York City, home to most of the nation's major book publishers.
   Lawyers for Holt said the ruling means the copyright law that
was ``intended to promote the progress of the useful arts is now
repeatedly being used to muzzle responsible biographers and
historians.''
   The publisher also said the Hubbard estate and the
Scientologists were largely successful in ``using their copyright
monopoly to manipulate the public perception of Mr. Hubbard and to
prevent disclosure of the uncomfortable truth about a man who held
himself out as a prophet.''
   Numerous groups, such as the American Historical Association and
the Authors Guild, supported the Holt appeal.
   ``Bare-Faced Messiah,'' written by Russell Miller, accuses
Hubbard of fakery and deception. Holt said quoting from Hubbard's
unpublished letters and diaries was intended to expose the church
founder's lies.
   New Era Publications, a Danish corporation, is the church
affiliate that holds the copyright on Hubbard's unpublished
material.
   The case is Holt vs. New Era Publications, 89-869.

   ``Island Son,'' a CBS television show starring

says an actor in the locally filmed medical drama.
   Chamberlain learned the show was canceled Friday during a
telephone conversation with Lorimar Productions in Los Angeles,
said Glenn Cannon, who heads the local Screen Actors Guild and had
a continuing role in the series.
   ``It was quite an enormous suprise and blow to everyone
involved,'' Cannon said. ``There really was no warning at all, and
the decision left a variety of people from Los Angeles scrambling
to get back to the mainland and find other work.''
   In New York City, CBS spokesman Michael Silver said he could not
confirm the report.
   The cancellation would put an estimated 80 drivers, production
crew and actors out of work.
   Members of the Interntional Alliance of Theatrical and Stage
Employees were told that Tuesday would be the last day of filming,
an official of the organization said.

<HEAD>Some Parents Suspected of Child Abuse May Be Jailed Indefinitely</HEAD>

   Parents suspected of child abuse may be jailed
indefinitely for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of their
children, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court said society's need to protect children from harm
generally outweighs a parent's constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
   By a 7-2 vote, the court upheld the indefinite jailing of a
Maryland woman until she tells authorities where her young son can
be found. The boy is feared dead.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said forcing
parents in such cases to reveal the whereabouts of children is
aimed at protecting the children and not gathering incriminating
evidence.
   ``Even when criminal conduct may exist, a court may properly
request production and return of the child ... for reasons related
entirely to the child's well-being and through measures unrelated
to criminal law enforcement or investigation,'' O'Connor said.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
   The court ruled against Jacqueline Bouknight, who has been in a
Baltimore jail since April 1988 for refusing to disclose the
whereabouts of her son, Maurice.
   The boy has been missing since September 1987, when he was 11
months old.
   Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore hospital on Jan. 23, 1987,
when he was 3 months old, for treatment of a broken leg and other
injuries. For a while, he was held in protective care after his
emotionally troubled mother was observed throwing Maurice into his
crib during the infant's hospitalization.
   Maurice was returned to his mother's custody on July 17, 1987,
after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergo
training in parenting skills.
   Nine months later, social workers said Bouknight no longer was
cooperating with them. Also, they said Maurice's father recently
had been shot to death in a drug-related killing and Bouknight was
using drugs.
   The mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on April 28,
1988, after she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts.
   But the Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court,
ruled in December that jailing her for refusing to disclose the
information violates her constitutional protection against
self-incrimination.
   She has remained in jail under an order by Chief Jusice William
H. Rehnquist that suspended the effect of the state court ruling.
   Some compared the Bouknight case to that of Dr. Elizabeth Morgan
of Washington, D.C., released from prison on Sept. 25 after more
than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughter visit
the girl's father, Morgan's former husband.
   Morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl for
court-ordered visits with the father. Morgan accused her former
husband of sexually abusing the child, charges he repeatedly has
denied.
   In the Bouknight case, O'Connor said the mother _ as custodian
of a child officials have determined has been abused _ has an
obligation to produce her son for authorities.
   ``These orders to produce children cannot be characterized as
efforts to gain some testimonial component of the act of
production,'' O'Connor said. ``Concern for the child's safety
underlay the efforts to gain access to and then compel production
of Maurice.''
   She hinted that prosecutors may be barred from using any
testimony Bouknight gives in producing the child.
   But Marshall, in his dissenting opinion, said that is little
comfort now for the mother.
   ``I am not content to deny Bouknight the constitutional
protection required ... now in the hope that she will not be
convicted later on the basis of her own testimony,'' he said in an
opinion joined by Brennan.
   The case is Baltimore Department of Social Services vs.
Bouknight, 88-1182.

   The Supreme Soviet legislature today urged a
crackdown on illegal demonstrations planned for Sunday and said
authorities should exercise tight control over permitted rallies,
the official Tass news agency reported.
   The legislators said they feared extremists and criminals will
exploit the demonstrations to destabilize the Soviet Union's
political situation.
   The rallies are being organized by political groups in Moscow,
Leningrad and other major cities ``to express their attitude to
changes taking place in the country,'' Tass said.
   The resolution, introduced by Deputy Nikolai Pivovarov, urged
authorities to curb unsanctioned rallies and force legal
demonstrations to be held in specifically assigned places.
   On Monday, Lithuania's Communist Party urged the Kremlin to
begin talks on granting independence to the republic, Tass reported.
   The committee adopted a statement saying it ``views as its chief
objective the restoration of an independent Lithuanian state and
the ensuring of its international recognition,'' the official news
agency said.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party declared itself independent from
the Soviet party on Dec. 20, creating the first major crack in the
monolithic party that has ruled the Soviet Union since the 1917
Bolshevik revolution.
   The Lithuanian statement said restoration of a Lithuanian state
must be achieved through ``parliamentary constitutional means,''
Tass said.
   ``Official negotiations between the Soviet Union and Lithuania
should begin soon with the aim of establishing stable international
relations and economic cooperation between the U.S.S.R. and
Lithuania,'' the news agency quoted the statement as saying.
   Lithuania, a Baltic republic with a population of 3.4 million,
was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 along with the
other Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who helped set in motion
nationalist movements by encouraging democratic reform, went on a
personal mission to the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius to try to
dissuade the republic's people from leaving the Soviet fold.
   But the Lithuanians showed themselves resolved to establish an
independent state.
   Last week, in an acknowledgment of slipping central authority,
the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee voted to end the
party's constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power and compete
for the right to govern.
   On Monday, the Supreme Soviet legislature devoted a closed-door
session to ethnic and nationalist unrest and sources said debate
focused on the restive southern Caucasus.
   Gorbachev chaired the session and supported a proposal for
Armenian and Azerbaijani delegates to begin negotiations on their
dispute, the sources said. It urges neighboring republics to draft
a treaty on their territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a
mainly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, but the Azerbaijanis
rejected the proposal and walked out of the session, said Arkady N.
Murachev, a Moscow delegate.
   Although reporters were barred from the seven-hour meeting, two
participants _ Murashev and Vitautas A. Statulyavicus of Lithuania
_ gave details in telephone interviews.
   Deputies agreed in a few days to vote on a resolution on the
dispute, the source of bloody feuding between the ethnic groups for
two years. But previous Supreme Soviet action has failed to calm
tempers in the Caucasus.
   On Jan. 20, Soviet troops stormed into the Azerbaijani capital
of Baku to put down a nationalist revolt and end attacks on members
of the ethnic Armenian minority. Official reports say 139 people
were killed, including 106 civilians, 28 troops and five policemen.
   Azerbaijani delegates blamed the army for the civilian deaths.
But Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov contended Azerbaijani
extremists were to blame.

   William Reed Huntington, the former Quaker
representative to the United Nations, has died of lung cancer at
age 83.
   Huntington, who died Sunday at home, was active for years in the
American Friends Service Committee, an organization of Quakers. He
also served as the director of the United Nations Quaker program.
   A native of New York City, he was the grandson of the Rev.
William Reed Huntington, longtime rector of Grace Episcopal Church
in New York. After graduating from Harvard College, he received a
master's degree in architecture from the University of Virginia. He
practiced architecture in St. James, N.Y., and Vermont, where he
retired in 1982.
   During World War II, Huntington was co-director of a camp for
conscientious objectors at Big Flats, N.Y. After the war he was
co-commissioner for relief operations in Europe for the American
Friends Service Committee.
   From 1961 to 1963, he was director of refugee assistance
operations in Tunisia and Algeria in connection with the
French-Algerian war. He served after that as the Quakers' U.N.
representative.

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier for Disabled Children to Win Welfare
Benefits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
disabled children to win some federal welfare benefits.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices struck down a government regulation
that gave children seeking the benefits less protection than adults.
   The Bush administration said the decision could force officials
to re-evaluate benefits for more than 250,000 children.
   The court ruled in favor of disabled children seeking what is
called supplemental security income from the Department of Health
and Human Services.
   The benefits are provided to the disabled of all ages. An adult
is considered disabled if he or she ``is unable to engage in any
substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically
determinable physical or mental impairment'' lasting at least a
year.
   Children under 18 are considered disabled if they suffer ``from
any medically determinable physical or mental impairment of
comparable severity.''
   The definitions were interpreted by HHS officials in a way that
made it more difficult for children to qualify.
   If an adult's mental condition does not meet one of those listed
in HHS regulations, he or she is entitled to an individual
assessment to determine the extent of the functional impairment.
   But the HHS rule struck down today did not permit such
individual determinations for children.
   The Bush administration said treating adults differently makes
sense because they are evaulated with regard to their ability to
work.
   But Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the Supreme Court,
said a similar analysis can be used with regard to children.
   ``An inquiry into the impact of an impairment on the normal
daily activities of a child...is no more amorphous or unmanageable
than an inquiry into the impact of an adult's impairment on his
ability to perform...gainful work,'' Blackmun said.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White
dissented.
   The case stemmed from an appeal by Brian Zebley of Pennsylvania,
who suffers from congenital brain damage that has caused
retardation and other problems. The government cut off the
supplemental benefits when the boy turned 4 in 1982.
   Justice Department officials said a victory for the Zebley boy
could force HHS to re-evaluate more than 250,000 cases in which
children have been denied benefits between 1983 and 1988. HHS
estimated the cost of the re-evaluations alone would be more than
$41 million.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Zebley, 88-1377.

<HEAD>Last All-Male Eating Club at Princeton Votes to Admit Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A century-old tradition of male-only
membership at two Princeton University eating clubs could end
within a year.
   Tiger Inn, one of the last two all-male eating clubs, voted
Monday to end its policy of excluding women from membership.
   The vote came less than a week after Ivy Club, the only other
all-male institution on the central New Jersey campus, voted in
favor of admitting women.
   Under club rules, a final policy change at each club requires a
second confirming vote in one year, which must then be approved by
each club's graduate board, made up of alumni.
   The Ivy Club and the Tiger Inn are the last two of the school's
13 private eating establishments that do not admit women. Most
juniors and seniors take their meals at the clubs, which are housed
in private homes near the campus.
   Despite pressure from opponents of the all-male policy, many
undergraduate women have attended the clubs, which allow women to
visit and use their facilities but not to join.
   ``I think women go there to all-male clubs because of their
laid-back attitude,'' sophomore Julie Slattery said. ``We always
have fun at their parties.''
   Tiger Inn President Mike Salerno said the decision to admit
women would enhance the club. ``Some here decided this day and this
year that it will be a positive change,'' he said.
   News of the vote pleased opponents of the male-only policies.
   ``I'm really happy and surprised,'' said Jen Weiner, a junior
who directs the Coalition for Coeducated Eating Clubs. ``I was
concerned that there would be some backlash because of Ivy's
decision in that the members might want Tiger to remain the last
bastion of all-maleness.''
   The two clubs have maintained their male-only positions for 11
years in the face of a sex discrimination lawsuit filed by Sally
Frank, a Princeton graduate.
   Ms. Frank filed a lawsuit against three eating clubs that
continued to deny membership to women after the university began
admitting female students in 1969. The other 10 voluntarily opened
their doors to women after the school went coed.
   Cottage Club, the third eating club originally sued by Ms.
Frank, voted to end its discriminatory practices in 1986 and
settled with Ms. Frank for $20,000.
   The university was originally named in the suit but also settled
in 1986, paying Ms. Frank $27,500 in legal fees and pledging to
disassociate itself from sexually segregated clubs.
   In May 1987, the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights ruled in
Ms. Frank's favor and ordered Tiger Inn and Ivy Club to admit
women. However, the Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division
reversed that decision in October 1988 due to procedural errors
following the clubs' appeal. The case is pending in the New Jersey
State Supreme Court.

   A blueberry poppy seed brunch cake won $40,000
for a marathon-running tax accountant today in the 34th Pillsbury
Bake-Off Cooking and Baking Contest.
   Linda Rahman of Petaluma, Calif., a graduate student at Golden
Gate University and a mother of two, won with a cake judges said
offered a refreshing flavor blend of blueberry, lemon and
poppyseed, combined with easy preparation and an appealing
appearance.
   Ms. Rahman also won a $10,000 kitchen makeover from Bake-Off
co-sponsor Sears.
   One man and four other women also won $10,000, and two men were
among the $2,000 winners.
   En route to selecting the 100 finalists in December, including a
record 12 men, the Pillsbury Co. considered more than 100,000
recipes. Illness forced one woman to miss the competition.
   Recipes were considered in one of four general groups _
Indulgent Treats, Healthful Alternatives, Ethnic Specialties or
Quick Ideas, the latter being the group in which Rahman's cake was
entered.
   Winners were further categorized by the type of Pillsbury
product on which their recipes centered _ for instance, mashed
potato flakes. Rahman's cake was made with flour.
   The $10,000 winners included Paula Cassidy of Berkeley, Calif.,
in the refrigerated pie crust category; Christine Vidra of Maumee,
Ohio, cake and brownie mix; Scott Wolf, Salem, Ore., frozen
vegetables; Nancy Woodside, Sonora, Calif., canned vegetables and
mashed potato flakes; and Sharon Richardson, Dallas, Texas,
refrigerated crescent dinner roll, biscuit and pizza crust.
   Debra Wolf, 20, Scott Wolf's sister and a $2,000 winner who is
also from Salem, Ore., said her creations often are inspired while
sleeping.
   ``It's mostly when I sleep or dream ... sometimes you'll see
things and then you think, `Hmmm, I could use that for the
Bake-Off,''' Ms. Wolf said Monday as contestants baked their
creations three times for the panel of judges.
   ``It's kind of like doing a poem _ you think it through and you
just do it,'' said Ms. Wolf, whose qualifying recipe was a coconut
fudge crescent tart.
   Besides Ms. Wolf, the $2,000 winners in the Refrigerated
Crescent Dinner Roll, Biscuit and Pizza Crust Category included
Marie Mickelson, Columbia Heights, Minn., and Gloria Pleasants,
Williamsburg, Va.
   Also winning $2,000 were:
   Refrigerated Pie Crust _ Robert Holt, Mendota Heights, Minn.;
James Sloboden, Puyallup, Wash.; and Eugenia Ward, Amherst, Wis.;
   Cake and Brownie Mix _ Helen Peach, Pensacola, Fla.; Frances
Sheppard, Corsicana, Texas; and Janice Weinrick, La Mesa, Calif.;
   Frozen Vegetable _ Jeanine Alfano, Montauk, N.Y.; Vesta Frizzel,
Independence, Mo.; and Joan Schweger, Elburn, Ill.;
   Canned Vegetable and Mashed Potato Flake _ Birdie Casement,
Denver, Colo.; Mary Lou Cook, Fallbrook, Calif.; and Ellen

<TEXT>
   The government is looking into whether to
enlist swarms of caterpillars in the war against cocaine in Peru
and Bolivia by setting them loose to eat coca plant leaves,
officials said today.
   But a spokesman for national drug policy director William
Bennett emphasized that the program is in the experimental stage
and that any unleashing of the caterpillars would have to be
approved by the Peruvian and Bolivian governments.
   The updated National Drug Control Strategy, released Jan. 25,
seeks $6.5 million for Agriculture Department research in fiscal
year 1991, starting Oct. 1, a $5 million increase over the $1.5
million to be spent this year.
   The Washington Post, which first reported on the plan in today's
editions, described the program to develop chemical and biological
agents to destroy drug crops as secretive.
   However, Bennett's spokesman, Don Hamilton, said: ``It's out
there in the strategy. It's in the budget documents. If we didn't
look into this stuff, I think we'd be irresponsible.''
   Hamilton stressed that, ``The United States is not considering
biological warfare against anyone or anything.
   ``These are experimental programs looking at all drug plants to
try and learn as much as we can about them, including herbicides
and natural enemies of the plants,'' he said. ``This isn't
something that is an option yet. It's a prospect of an option.''
   The proposed experiments, he said, ``would have to show that one
of these things was safe and effective ... and then, you would have
to talk to the governments involved and see if they're interested.
Until you do that, you don't have anything,'' the spokesman said.
   The Post said the principal focus of the effort is the malumbia,
a white moth that in its caterpillar stages eats the leaves of the
coca plant.
   Growers in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, where more than half
the world's cocaine originates, douse their crops with insecticide
to kill the native malumbia caterpillars.
   The newspaper said researchers believe that if they could breed
the insect in mass quantities, hundreds of millions of malumbia
eggs or caterpillars could be airdropped over the coca-growing
regions, thwarting the growers' efforts at crop protection.
   Waldemar Klassen, associate deputy administrator for the
Agricultural Research Service, told the Post, ``This is quite a
voracious caterpillar. If we could put them down there in
sufficient number, we could then defoliate the plants.''
   Klassen was not immediately available to discuss the report.
Both Klassen and program leader Larry Christy were in meetings this
morning, according to aides.
   The Post reported that there has been no public disclosure of
the project, and one official told the newspaper he was reluctant
to discuss it for fear of upsetting Latin American leaders.
   Hamilton denied that the research was secret, adding that
general outlines were included in the strategy update and
accompanying budget document.
   The strategy does not specifically mention the caterpillar
experiments or provide details of research plans, but it notes:
``Great advances have been made in agriculture through the
development of biological agents to enhance or reduce the
productivity of various crops .... Such endeavors may also have
applicability to various aspects of the drug war.''
   The strategy says this is the reason for the $5 million increase
in the Agricultural Research Service drug budget request and says
the research findings would be ``shared with, and be made available
to, foreign governments.''
   The drug strategy budget summary document says the $5 million
would be used in part to ``support increased research and
development on nonherbicidal methods of control.''
   President Nixon encouraged work on a biologically engineered
worm during the height of the heroin epidemic in the 1970s. More
recently, scientists have been working on an herbicide to kill
drug-producing crops. Both efforts were not been carried forward
because of political resistance by Latin American governments.
   ``We're not looking for some magic bullet here,'' Hamilton said.
Even if the caterpillar successfully wiped out coca crops, he said,
``You've still got other drugs. ... This doesn't end everyone's
problems by any stretch of the imagination.''

<TEXT>
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow today urged
East German and West German experts to start immediate talks on
reunification under a formula negotiated with the World War II
Allies last week.
   Meanwhile, a joint commission led by Cabinet ministers of the
two Germanys met today for the first time for talks on monetary and
economic union between the two states, a major step on the road to
unification.
   Modrow, addressing the East German Parliament, said experts from
the two German states should ``begin preparing the `2-plus-4'
conference as soon as possible.''
   At a meeting in Ottawa, Canada, the victorious World War II
Allies _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France _
agreed with the two German states on a two-stage plan to achieve
German unification.
   In the first stage, experts from the two Germanys would discuss
political, economic and legal steps to achieve unity. In the second
stage, the two states would be joined by the four allies to discuss
the international implications of unification. The formula became
known as ``2-plus-4.''
   Parallel to these talks, preparations should be made for the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Modrow
said.
   Modrow also said the German states should issue a joint
statement guaranteeing Poland's western borders.
   He again ruled out membership in NATO for a united Germany. The
Soviet Union wants a united Germany to become neutral, while West
Germany and its Western allies insist it should remain in the
alliance.
   Earlier in his address to Parliament, Modrow appealed to East
Germans not to hoard food, following announcement that subsidies
would be removed soon. He said he had heard of runs on grocery
stores to stock up while prices remain low.
   ``I ask every citizen to show restraint and not to buy beyond
normal needs,'' he said.
   On Monday, representatives of 16 organizations, including the
Communist-led government, the pro-democracy parties and labor
unions, agreed to abolish state food subsidies before the March 18
free elections.
   The subsidies are being lifted in part to stop a run by West
Germans on cheaper food across the border, and to put prices in
line with the cost of production.
   Modrow did not specify which areas of East Germany were
suffering from panic food-buying, and no unusual crowding was
noticed at East Berlin stores.
   Modrow also urged East Germans to keep their money in the banks.
East Germans, worried about their savings becoming worthless under
a monetary union with West Germany, have been withdrawing their
funds from banks.
   He repeated his rejection of a monetary union before the
election and again urged the West German government to approve
massive immediate aid for the struggling East German economy.
   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met with industrial
leaders to discuss German economic cooperation. He said there would
be no bailout unless East Germany adopts wide reforms to encourage
private investment, including accepting the West German mark as the
official currency.
   Leaders in both states hope a monetary union would stem the
daily exodus of 2,000 East Germans to their rich neighbor.
   Walter Romberg, the minister without portfolio heading East
Germany's side in the talks, said the panel would attempt to define
exactly what a monetary and economic union is and what is needed to
achieve it.
   Romberg said East Germany will demand safeguards to protect his
country's pensioners, unemployed and the savings of its citizens
against losses in the event of monetary union.
   Horst Koehler, the state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry
leading the West German delegation said no target date for
concluding the negotiations had been set.
   East German Economics Minister Christa Luft said Monday she
believed a monetary union was possible before the end of the year.
   Kohl earlier this month offered a quick monetary union,
believing it would give East Germans confidence in their future.
But East Germans fear unemplyoment, as inefficient factories are
forced to close under a more competitive, capitalist system.
   While talks on reunification opened, another piece of the Cold
War headed into oblivion as East German border guards started
dismantling the Berlin Wall between the Reichstag building and the
Checkpoint Charlie border crossie next month, the wall will be removed
until the entire
1.2-mile stretch between the parliament building, or Reichstag, and
Checkpoint Charlie is gone.
   Since East Germany opened its borders on Nov. 9, numerous
crossings have been opened in the wallng.
   Over th. Thousands of souvenir
hunters have chiseled away huge chunks of the concrete, leaving
gaping holes.
   Despite euphoria over removal of the hated wall, the two
countries' moves toward unification is provoking unease. According
to a survey commissioned by West Germany's ZDF television network,
two-thirds of West Germans think the process is unfolding too fast.
   The survey also revealed 71 percent of West Germans want Berlin
to become the capital of reunited GermanSlug PM-Drought Payments. Sent

<HEAD>Court Upholds Child Pornography Charges Against Albany Man</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's highest court today upheld child
pornography charges against an Albany man in a case involving only
the purchase of pornography, not its distribution or production.
   But the court disappointed prosecutors by stopping short of a
precedent-setting decision that could have outlawed the possession
of child pornography throughout the state.
   The Court of Appeals decided 7-0 that Albany County prosecutors
had properly secured a five-count indictment against William Keyes
for promoting a sexual performance by a child.
   A lawyer for Keyes, 41, contended that although Keyes bought the
magazines and videotapes with titles including ``Wonderboy'' and
``Lolita Colour Special 7'' from undercover police officers, he had
not ``procured'' the magazines and videotapes under the meaning of
the state anti-pornography statute.
   To fall under the law, Albany lawyer Terence Kindlon argued,
Keyes would have had to arrange for under-age models to appear in a
pornographic performance, or he would have had to sell the items
himself to other people.
   The court rejected those arguments.
   In a decision by Judge Fritz Alexander III, the court concluded
that the state Legislature clearly meant for the purchase of child
pornography to fall under the acts covered by the word ``procure''
when creating the statute a decade ago.
   Alexander said the statute is ``directed at the consumers of
child pornography as well as at its manufacturers and
distributors.''
   However, the court did not make the kind of blanket anti-child
pornography pronouncement that prosecutor George Barber had hoped
it would make.
   Alexander did call child pornography a ``social evil.'' But
because Keyes was charged with ``promoting'' the items rather than
possessing them, Alexander said it was not necessary for the court
to address the question of whether possession of child pornography
is constitutionally protected.
   Thirteen states have explicitly outlawed possession of child
pornography, and Barber said he had hoped the court today would
remind New York's Legislature that it could follow suit.
   Keyes, an auto body worker and partially disabled Vietnam War
veteran, faces a maximum of 3{ to 7 years in prison on each of the
five counts. He had been on 5 years' probation for a conviction for
promoting a sexual performance by a child at the time of his arrest.

<TEXT>
   A quadriplegic who received court
permission to turn off the machine that keeps him alive plans to
ask the Georgia Senate on Wednesday to take steps to help people in
his situation.
   Larry McAfee, 34, who since has abandoned plans to take his own
life, has said he plans to ask the lawmakers ``to review their
policies of keeping people like myself cooped away in nursing
homes.''
   He said he also will talk about his general dislike of nursing
homes, which he said cause patients to lose control of decisions
about their everyday lives.
   McAfee, a Georgia resident, was sent to Briarcliff Nursing Home
at Alabaster in August because it is one of the few residences with
special units for patients dependent on ventilators to help them
breathe. Last fall, he got permission from the Georgia Supreme
Court to turn off his ventilator.
   McAfee, a mechanical engineer and sportsman before a 1985
motorcycle accident left him paralyzed below the chin, changed his
mind about the ventilator after he was befriended by several people
who work at the nursing home.
   McAfee will speak to the lawmakers at the request of state Sen.
Hildred Shumake. An aide, Vinyl Baker, said Shumake plans to work
to change the system that forces McAfee and other disabled people
to remain in institutions.
   Because his federal disability payments are not enough to pay
for his care, McAfee must depend on Medicare and Medicaid.
   Neither federal insurance program will pay for living expenses
outside an institution, although advocates for the disabled say
such arrangements generally would be less expensive than nursing
home care.
   McAfee said he believes educating lawmakers and the public about
the things disabled people are forced to endure is the only way of
changing the system. ``If it doesn't help me, I am hoping that at
least it will help others,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of
a Georgia school district ordered to pay lawyer fees incurred in
administrative hearings by a couple who won a ``free and
appropriate'' education for their handicapped daughter.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the federal
law guaranteeing educational opportunity for handicapped youngsters
authorizes such lawyer-fee awards.
   Lawyers for the Muscogee County School District had argued that
lawyer fees may be awarded only when parents who invoke the federal
law prevail in court, not in administrative proceedings.
   The school district lawyers told the justices that federal
appeals courts are divided over the issue of awarding lawyer fees
incurred in administrative hearings.
   The Muscogee County controversy began when Paige Mitten, a
13-year-old girl with cerebral palsy, partial blindness and mental
retardation, moved with her family to Columbus, Ga., in 1985.
   Paige had been attending public schools in Texas, where an
individualized education plan was developed for her.
   County school officials refused to permit Paige to enter the
public school system or to develop a new individual education plan
for her. Instead, they recommended she be placed in a state-run
center in Columbus.
   Paige's parents objected to placing her in the center but did so
on a temporary basis.
   At an administrative proceeding in late 1985, a regional hearing
officer ruled that the school district violated the federal
Education of the Handicapped Act by not providing Paige with the
required free and appropriate education.
   School district officials appealed, but a state hearing officer
upheld the regional hearing officer's findings.
   But the state hearing officer also concluded that the Mittens
would have to sue in federal court in their attempt to recover
legal fees incurred in their fight to get Paige an education.
   A federal judge ruled that no lawyer-fee awards are available
under the Handicapped Children's Protection Act for administrative
proceedings. But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
that ruling last July 20, and ordered the judge to determine how
much the school district should pay.
   The school district then sought Supreme Court review.
   The case is Muscogee County School Distict vs. Mitten, 89-905.

<HEAD>Government Orders Army to Maintain Order in Kosovo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today ordered the
army to maintain order in the troubled Kosovo province, where
growing violence between ethnic Serbs and Albanians has claimed
nearly 30 lives this year.
   The order means that the army will for the first time be
directly engaged in quelling the unrest together with the police,
sources close to the Yugoslav leadership told The Associated Press.
   The army has deployed heavy reinforcements in Kosovo over the
past year, but until now, it apparently was deployed only as a show
of force.
   The decision was reached during a rare emergency session of the
eight-member state presidency in charge of the armed forces.
   The presidency ``has decided to partially engage units of the
Yugoslav Peoples' Army in Kosovo with the aim of protecting
constitutional order and preventing violence,'' the presidency said
in a statement carried by the state Tanjug news agency.
   The use of the army comes amid continuing protests by the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo and the rival Serb minority there.
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the region's 1.9 million
inhabitants.
   The presidency's statement said the ``security situation in
Kosovo has seriously deteriorated'' because of the unrest ``which
could have tragic consequences for all citizens in this province
and for the country as a whole.''
   Parts of Kosovo have been under a virtual state of emergency for
the past year, with heavy troop presence in the region,
particularly during the last month of renewed unrest. At least 27
people have been killed this year.
   Serbs in the province today threatened to take up arms to defend
themselves against what they claim is harassment by the ethnic
Albanian majority if authorities do not take action.
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians staged work stoppages or stayed
away from schools in the province today to protest a state of
emergency in the region. Several thousand also demonstrated in the
provincial capital and in other Kosovo towns, in some instances
clashing with security forces.
   Some 4,000 ethnic Albanian university students from Kosovo's
capital Pristina marched through the city chanting ``Democracy!
Democracy!'' and demanding a multiparty system, free elections, the
release of political prisoners and an end to the state of emergency.
   About 10,000 Serbs rallied in Kosovo Polje, a suburb of
Pristina, demanding swift police action against ethnic Albanians
who have been demonstrating sporadically for almost a month to
press demands for more autonomy and democratization.

<HEAD>White House Was Aware of Drug Missile Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The White House was aware of the possibility
that drug traffickers in Colombia had surface-to-air missiles in
advance of President Bush's trip last week to a four-nation drug
summit, his spokesman said today.
   But press secretary Marlin Fitzwater added that, despite
security concerns over the prospect, there was no hard evidence to
confirm the reports.
   On Monday, guerrillas dynamited a power station and attacked
police posts in Cartagena, Colombia, four days after the drug
summit there, and police seized 10 shoulder-fired missiles in
Bogota from drug traffickers, authorities said.
   Asked about the missile seizure, Fitzwater told reporters, ``I
don't have specific information. There was intelligence before we
left of various kinds, about missiles and rockets and other kinds
of equipment, with various plans.''
   ``There is no question that there has been terrorist activities
in that country, and that the kind of people operating there, the
drug cartel, were capable of this,'' the spokesman added.
   Two Americans remained in captivity: 65-year-old James Donnelly
of Detroit and 40-year-old David Kent of Indianapolis. They were
kidnapped by guerrillas a week ago in the northwest city of
Medellin.
   In Cartagena, guerrillas dynamited an electric power substation
Monday night, knocking out power to much of the city of 530,000
people, and attacked three police posts, wounding five officers,
police said.
   Authorities said the shoulder-fired missiles _ which can shoot
down planes _ were found in a raid Monday on a Bogota drug hideout.
   ``I think we said at the time that we did not have any
confirmable information that there was a threat for SAM-7 missiles
(the shoulder-mounted variety),'' Fitzwater said.
   ``To my knowledge that has not changed. But there's intelligence
suggesting all kinds of capabilities and these always have to be
matters of concern.''

   ``We believe our two nations can now begin to solve many of the
economic problems that exist between us,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. ``We look forward to working with
the new government in the days ahead.''
   He said Bush was interested in meeting with Kaifu. ``We don't
have any specific plans although I know President Bush is certainly
willing to meet him at the earliest convenience, but nothing's been
worked out at this point.''
   In Sunday's elections for the lower house of Parliament, the

   The Supreme Court today refused to block a
state court libel lawsuit against the NAACP by a Virginia Beach,
Va., white policeman who fatally shot a 22-year-old black man.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the suit
against the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People and one of its officials must be tried in state, rather than
federal, court.
   Eddie Upchurch shot and killed Fred T. Gilchrist on June 20,
1987. Upchurch said he fired unintentionally when Gilchrist tried
to grab his gun.
   Aaron Wheeler of the local NAACP branch was quoted in the
Virginia Pilot as calling the shooting a murder.
   ``This is a senseless murder and something has to be done about
it,'' the newspaper quoted Wheeler as saying.
   In his libel suit, Upchurch said Wheeler's remarks were false
and that the civil rights official knew they were false or spoke
them with reckless disregard for the truth. The officer's suit
contended that the NAACP had approved Wheeler's comments.
   Wheeler and the NAACP sought to move the case from state to
federal court to determine whether the the sued-over statements
were assertions of fact or libel-proof expressions of opinion.
   Wheeler and the civil rights group also contended that a black
accused of libeling a white cannot get a fair trial in Virginia
state courts. They cited ``the lingering viability'' of an 1847
state law that said ``a Negro shall be punished with stripes'' _ a
whipping _ ``if he uses provoking language or menacing gestures to
a white person.''
   U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr. said there are no
grounds for believing blacks will be denied fair treatment in
Virginia courts. The judge said Wheeler and the NAACP were unable
to cite any laws or court cases to support their claims.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Clarke's ruling
last July.
   Virginia Beach on other occasions has been the scene of racial
tensions. Law enforcement officers were accused of civil rights
violations while quelling a riot among a crowd of 100,000 youths
there over the Labor Day weekend this year.
   Police used clubs to disperse the crowds, which largely
consisted of students from predominantly black East Coast colleges
attending the annual end-of-summer Greekfest.
   The case is Virginia NAACP vs. Upchurch, 89-506.

   The president of the International Olympic
Committee today dismissed reforms in South Africa as cosmetic and
said a sports ban against the white-ruled African state will
continue.
   ``The ingredients for eradicating apartheid have not been
lifted, therefore the international sanctions should be maintained
to pressure South Africa to lift its policy of apartheid,'' Juan
Antonio Samaranch told a news conference.
   ``There will be no relaxation in efforts to put an end to
apartheid in sport in South Africa,'' he declared.
   Samaranch said any decision to lift the ban will be taken only
after consulting with other African nations.
   He said South Africa's sporting links with other countries were
limited to cricket and rugby. But he noted that the IOC has no
control over those two sports.
   Samaranch spoke after meeting in Kuwait with the IOC Apartheid
and Olympic Commission and later with representatives of a special
United Nations anti-apartheid commission.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialists in the European Parliament
have come up with a gift to help their East European counterparts
along the road to democracy: a campaign bus _ red, of course.
   The nine-seat minibus will first be used by the East German
Social Democratic Party in the campaign for March 18 elections. It
will then be used in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   Rental costs of the bus will be met by a special fund set up by
the Socialist Group.
   Members of the 180-strong group, the largest in the 518-seat
assembly which usually meets in Strasbourg, France, agreed to
donate the allowance of $177 they each get for every day they are
on business in Brussels or Strasbourg. The group matches the
amounts thus raised from its own funds.
   The Socialist members will continue to donate all or part of
their daily allowance until the elections are over, said Tony
Robinson, a spokesman for the group.
   The bus will be handed over to the East German SPD by Socialist
group chairman Jean-Pierre Cot and Confederation of EC Socialist
Parties' chairman Guy Spitaels in a ceremony at the European
Parliament on Wednesday.
   In addition to the bus, the group assigned staff to assist the
East European parties to set up and run their campaigns.
   A major election rally with leaders of West European Socialist
parties is due to be held in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, on
March 9.

<HEAD>Court To Hear Discrimination Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to settle a
dispute over deadlines for filing lawsuits charging on-the-job
discrimination.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Shirley W. Irwin, a
handicapped former employee of the Veterans Administration Medical
Center in Waco, Texas.
   Irwin said the VA fired him illegally on April 17, 1986.
   He sought help from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
But the commission rejected his claim, delivering its decision to
the office of Irwin's attorney on March 23, 1987.
   The lawyer was out of the country on Army Reserve duty, and
Irwin said as a result he did not learn of the EEOC decision until
April 10.
   Irwin filed a federal suit charging illegal job discrimination
on May 6.
   But a judge threw out the case because Irwin missed a deadline
of filing suit within 30 days of an adverse decision by the EEOC.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge last
June, ruling the federal courts lacked jurisdiction in such cases
when deadlines are missed.
   The case is Irwin vs. Veterans Administration, 89-5867.

<TEXT>
   An exiled leader of last June's pro-democracy
movement went before the U.N. Human Rights Commission on Tuesday
and condemned Beijing for continued repression in a speech that a
Chinese delegate failed to stop.
   Wu'er Kaixi told the 43-nation panel that ``systematic
violations of human rights'' continue in his native country and
urged the international community to keep a close watch on the
situation there.
   Wu'er, who is continuing his studies in the United States, said
underground resistance networks are still trying to organize in
major Chinese cities.
   ``We believe that the measures taken in Beijing after the
lifting of the martial law are nothing but an attempt to dismantle
and eradicate this type of organization,'' he said.
   ``At the same time, the massive campaign of arbitrary arrests
and executions launched in June _ most of them secret _ has not yet
ceased,'' he added.
   Wu'er, 22, spoke as a member of the delegation of the
Paris-based International Federation of Human Rights, one of more
than 100 non-governmental organizations that have been granted a
consultative status with the U.N. body and are allowed to address
the session.
   As soon as Wu'er began speaking, the Chinese delegate to the
commission, given the floor on a point of order, protested his
presence.
   ``This speaker is a criminal wanted by the Chinese security
organs,'' said the delegate, Shiqiu Chen. ``He is here as a tool of
certain anti-Chinese elements abroad who engage in slanderous
attacks on China.''
   He repeated his attack in a brief exchange with the president of
the commission, Purificacion Quisumbing of the Philippines. She
then asked Wu'er to continue after telling Shiqiu that Wu'er was a
``duly accredited member of a duly accredited organization.''

   Heavy rains that caused nine deaths abated in the South but high
waters continued to rise and threatened new flooding, while deep
snow bedeviled the West, closing 200 miles of a major east-west
highway.
   Federal officials surveyed east-central Illinois to determine
whether the area qualifies for disaster relief. Workers struggled
to restore power to thousands of residents in Champaign after snow
and ice storms last week.
   A teen-ager made good use of survival training during a night
outdoors in near-zero temperatures after searchers found her at a
Lake Tahoe ski resort, authorities said. Maureen Lamerdin, 14,
became lost Sunday while skiing in an unmarked area and was found
Monday, suffering only cold toes.
   Lamerdin slept in a snow cave she built and exercised when she
got cold. She was released to her home in Glenbrook, Nev., after
doctors examined her.
   Highway crews continued to remove mud from Interstate 80 near
Auburn, Calif., and the California Transportation Department said
that a ruptured water flume might have contributed to a mudslide
that closed the highway for most of Sunday.
   However, a spokesman for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., which
operates the flume, said the utility doesn't accept any
responsibility for the slide.
   ``We are denying that the flume was any part of the problem,''
said PG&amp;E spokesman Tim Leong.
   He said an investigation is continuing to determine the cause of
the slide and the utility planned to send its own geologist to the
site. reported.
   Heavy snow fell early Monday across the high country of northern
Arizona and state officials closed a 200-mile stretch of east-west
Interstate 40, a major east-west route from North Carolina to
California.
   Along I-40, Flagstaff, at an elevation of almost 7,000 feet, got
13 inches of snow. The south rim of the Grand Canyon got 17 inches,
and nearby Williams 24.
   ``No, it hasn't gotten any better, we got about 15 to 17 inches
overnight,'' said Chris Harris, desk clerk at Bright Angel lodge at
the south rim of Grand Canyon National Park.
   ``You can't really get around. You can get up here but I
wouldn't recommend it. The roads are pretty packed with snow and
ice,'' Harris said late Monday.
   One to two feet fell in the mountains of southern Utah, snow
moved into New Mexico and in Colorado two skiers triggered an
avalanche when they skied out-of-bounds Sunday near Crested Butte,
authorities said. One of the skiers was rescued Monday but the
other's body was found under 7 feet of snow.
   Interstate 25 over Raton Pass in northern New Mexico was closed
because of poor visibility caused by blowing snow, authorities said
this morning.
   The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for
the southern foothills and all of southeastern Colorado, where an
additional 4 to 6 inches of snow was forecast today. A heavy snow
warning was posted for the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which could
receive another foot of snow.
   ``This is a very good deal for southern Colorado,'' said Joe
Baskin, a forecaster at the weather service office in Denver.
``They've been dry. They're well below their usual moisture levels
across the southern part of the state.''
   In the South, floods since late last week have been blamed for
three deaths each in Georgia and Alabama, two in Mississippi and
one in North Carolina.
   Federal and state emergency officials were expected to request
federal disaster assistance today in Georgia from Gov. Joe Frank
Harris, who promised speedy action.
   ``Just as soon as we have the proper information to make
application, which is routine, we will be sending that information
on to the federal government,'' Harris said.
   Only light rain fell early Monday on soggy northwestern Georgia,
where 12 inches of rain Friday caused extensive flooding that
forced more than 1,000 to leave their homes.
   The Oostanaula River was expected to crest at about 31 feet
before slowing falling today.
   A National Weather Service spokesman said the Alabama River was
expected to crest today by late evening in Montgomery at about 43
feet, eight feet above flood stage.
   Downstream at Selma, where the Alabama crested about 3 feet
above flood level in June 1979, it reached 5 feet above flood stage
Monday and was expected to crest there Wednesday.
   Thunderstorms and heavy rain expected Wednesday night and
Thursday could bring the worst flooding in the state in more than a
decade.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus took advantage of a break in the
rainy weather Monday to make a helicopter tour of flooded areas.
Even before his tour, Mabus declared a state of emergency for all
82 counties.
   ``We do not have an exact figure but a ballpark estimate would
be about 400 homes affected by flooding,'' Mississippi Emergency
Management Agency spokesman Dusty Perkins said Monday. ``There
could be more when we complete a door-to-door survey.''
   Roads were impassable in many areas.
   The Chickasawhay River in the east-central Mississippi town of
Shubuta was at 42.6 feet Monday after climbing eight feet in 24
hours. Flood stage is 30 feet and the river was forecast to crest
near 45.0 feet early Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Pakistani and Indian troops
exchanged fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier
became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border,
officers and a western observer said.
   The soldier was shot in the leg Sunday at a ceasefire line,
several miles from the village of Chaukothi, officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   They said there were no reports of casualties from today's
firefight at the line, which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and
India.
   The nations have twice gone to war over the Himalayan state, in
1948 and again in 1965. The former princely state was divided
between the two nations after British colonial rule ended in 1947.
   Relations between the neighbors have become increasingly
strained since Jan. 20 when Indian troops launched a military
crackdown on Moslem separatists in turbulent Jammu-Kashmir.
   The militants want India's only majority Moslem state to either
become independent or join Pakistan. Jammu-Kashmir is an aberration
in India, where 82 percent of the country's 880 million people are
Hindus.
   The leaders of both countries have tried to soothe tempers in
the dispute and have said another war over the region is unlikely.
   However, Pakistani forces have now sealed off the border area at
Chaukothi, forbidding civilians from entering the area.
   The border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on
Feb. 11 between Indian troops and Pakistani students, who were
marching in solidarity with activists in Indian-held Kashmir.
   Indian troops killed three students and wounded several during
that confrontation, a Pakistan defence ministry spokesman said. The
two armies also exchanged gunfire for about 30 minutes before calm
was restored.
   A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight,
said unlike the occasional shootings in the past, Indian soldiers
appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troops. The western observer
said Sunday's shooting of the Pakistan soldier appeared to back up
that assertion.
   In another sign of increased tensions, Pakistani and Indian
officers are no longer accompanying United Nations' military
observers as they pass through the borders.
   ``It is not a normal situation,'' the officer said. ``The border
is extremely tense.''
   Pakistan officials said they were taking steps to quell what one
official called ``war fever'' on the Pakistan side.
   ``We are trying to tie the people down,'' said Amir Alan Khan, a
retired lieutenant colonel who heads Kashmir's civil defence. He
said hundreds of retired soldiers have approached him ``to ask for
orders'' to fight the Indian army.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Issue on Exclusion of Blacks as Jurors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether prosecutors who exclude blacks as jurors because of their
race violate the rights of white defendants.
   The justices said they will review the case of a white Ohio man,
Larry Joe Powers, convicted of two murders by a state court jury
after seven blacks who could have served as jurors were excluded.
   The high court in 1986 ruled that when prosecutors disqualify
potential jurors based on their race it violates the 14th
Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.
   But that case involved a black defendant and black jurors. The
court never has said whether unlawful racial discrimination in jury
selection occurs when the defendant is of a different race than the
excluded jurors.
   In a decision announced Jan. 22, however, five of the court's
nine justices implied that excluding blacks as jurors because of
their race does discriminate unlawfully against white defendants.
   The court in that decision ruled that a separate right _ the 6th
Amendment guarantee of an impartial jury _ is not violated when
prosecutors exclude blacks as jurors if the defendants are white.
   Although it was not an issue in the case, five justices _
Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul
Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy _ seemed to agree that such
race-based exclusions do violate any defendant's 14th Amendment
right.
   Powers was convicted of the July 27, 1985, murders in Columbus
of Gary Golden and Thomas Kicas. He was sentenced to 50 years to
life in prison.
   During jury selection at the trial, Powers' lawyer objected to
the prosecution's exclusion of the seven black jurors. The
presiding judge overruled the objections.
   A state appeals court upheld the convictions.
   The case is Powers vs. Ohio, 89-5011.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party
agreed Tuesday that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu should stay in
office and form a new Cabinet.
   Because of his weak power base in the party, Kaifu's position
had been considered uncertain despite an election victory Sunday
that gave the Liberal Democrats a comfortable majority in the
powerful lower house of Parliament.
   Kaifu had said he would resign if the party, which was formed in
1955 and has governed Japan since, lost its majority.
   Doubt was cast on the party's chances by a widespread
influence-buying scandal and an unpopular sales tax, but it won 275
of the 512 seats in the lower house, which chooses the prime
minister and controls the budget.
   If 14 conservative independents join them as expected, the
Liberal Democrats will not be far short of their 295 seats in the
outgoing house.
   The leading opposition Japan Socialist Party won 136 seats, up
from 83. The party leader is expected to vote for a leader soon and
Takako Doi, the chairwoman who led the Socialists in Sunday's
election, is expected to win.
   Japan National Broadcast Corp. said a Socialist election would
be held March 25-26 and no one would challenge Mrs. Doi.
   A vote for the Socialists was widely viewed as a protest of the
new 3 percent sales tax and scandals in the ruling party. The
Socialists entered only 149 candidates and could not have won a
majority.
   Ms. Doi attributed the outcome to the powerful political
machines of Liberal Democrats and support from big business.
   Sunday's results illustrated the tendency of Japanese voters to
forgive indiscretions of the ruling party eventually, which has
helped the Liberal Democrats weather several scandals.
   Voters registered their dissatisfaction over the latest one,
which involved insider stock deals and large political
contributions by the Recruit Co. information conglomerate, by
depriving the party of its majority in the less powerful upper
house in July 1989.
   Most senior Liberal Democrats tied to the scandal were
re-elected Sunday, including former Prime Ministers Yasuhiro
Nakasone, 72, and Noboru Takeshita, 65, and some former Cabinet
ministers. Nakasone ran as an independent.
   Dozens of influential business and political figures resigned
because of the scandal and 12 are being tried for giving or taking
bribes.
   Popularity ratings had plummeted when Kaifu, 59, became prime
minister in August. He was untainted by the Recruit affair and
helped clean up the party image by promising reforms.
   Kaifu also has promised to ease the sales tax on food and some
other basic items.

<HEAD>Soviets Cite Problems With Arabs In Holding Up Direct Flights To
Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a strong U.S. plea, the Soviet Union
is unwilling to renew diplomatic relations with Israel or begin
direct flights of Jewish immigrants to Tel Aviv, U.S. officials
said Tuesday.
   ``We're disappointed that they have not approved those
(flights),'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said.
``But we're hopeful it still might happen.''
   Both issues were raised by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze during talks in Moscow
two weeks ago. Baker also expressed concern about flashes of
anti-Semitism, particularly threats of pogroms on specified dates
by anti-Jewish groups.
   ``Considering what has happened with Armenians, the threats are
not far-fetched,'' said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. The source said Baker was told that one of the
unfortunate results of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
glasnost, or openness, is that ``nasty views get an airing.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said President Bush ``is concerned
about reports of growing anti-semitism in that country. He heard
from American Jewish leaders just a week or two ago who voiced
great concern on that issue.''
   Soviet relations with Israel were broken by Moscow in 1967 after
Israel defeated Egypt, which has been armed by the Soviet Union,
and other Arab states in a Mideast war.
   In 1988, an Israeli delegation, including Russian-speaking
Jewish emigres, went to Moscow to check conditions at the former
Israeli embassy. A group of Soviet diplomats went to Tel Aviv the
following spring.
   The exchange was generally seen as a move toward restoration of
relations.
   In the meantime, Israel is restoring ties with Soviet allies in
Eastern Europe, beginning with Hungary late last year, with
Czechoslovakia on Feb. 9 and with Poland next week. Discussions are
under way with East Germany and Bulgaria. Romania never broke with
Tel Aviv.
   Asked why Moscow was not renewing its ties, as well, the U.S.
officials said, the Soviets replied they were ``looking into it.''
   The Soviets also cited the settlement of some Jewish emigres _
about 100 of the thousands who have poured into Israel in the last
few months _ on the West Bank as ``a complicating factor.''
   The Bush administration has criticized the settling of Jews on
the West Bank and in Gaza as an obstacle to peace talks.
   Additionally, the officials said, the Soviets continue to say
that Israel must take ``further steps toward the Palestinians.''
   More than 4,500 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel last month as a
result of Gorbachev's lenient emigration policy and U.S. pressure
over the last several years. Israeli officials estimate at least
twice as many would make the exodus if the Soviets permitted direct
flights to Tel Aviv.
   The Soviet airline Aeroflot and the Israeli airline El Al signed
an agreement last year for direct flights. It was due to be
implemented Jan. 1.
   When Baker asked about the delay, the Soviets ``weren't
encouraging,'' an official said.
   ``They didn't specifically say they are never going to do it,''
the source said. ``They cited problems with the Arabs about
settlements and Soviet immigrants. We pointed out the number on the
West Bank are minuscule.''
   And yet, the official said, ``they clearly did not encourage us
they were going to move on this soon.''
   The administration is eager to have the air accord implemented
because U.S. admission of Soviet Jewish refugees is limited to
50,000 under a quota set by President Bush in October. Thousands
more are able to leave.
   At the same time, the administration is closing U.S. processing
centers in Vienna and Rome where thousands of Jews who left with
exit permits for Israel are waiting to be resettled in the United
States.
   ``We believe that direct flights would be helpful in increasing
the number of people that can get out,'' Fitzwater said.
   Last Friday, the administration concluded an agreement with the
Council of Jewish Federations and the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society
to fly up to 8,000 refugees _ most of them Jews _ to the United
States.
   The Jewish groups will pay for processing and transporting the
refugees, and also their medical examinations, placement and
initial resettlement for two years after they enter the country.
   The estimated cost is about $30 million.

<TEXT>
   The country's High Court has banned the
publication or sale of the memoirs of former leader Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo.
   The injuction, issued Monday and published Tuesday, came at the
request of Judge Taslim Elias, a judge of the International Court
of Justice in The Hague who is suing Obasanjo for alleged libel in
the book, ``Not My Will.''
   Elias alleges the publication portrays him as incompetent in
managing Nigeria's judicial affairs while chief justice of this
West African nation in the 1970s.
   He is claiming $15 million in damages from the retired general,
whose book outlines events in Nigeria under his leadership from
1976 to 1979.
   Obasanjo returned Nigeria to civilian rule, but it lasted only
until 1983, when elected civilian President Shehu Shagari was
ousted by the military. The present leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida,
has promised a return to civilian rule in 1992.

<HEAD>As Expected, Paula Zahn Joins ``CBS This Morning''</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY17</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS News made it official Tuesday, announcing
that former ABC anchorwoman Paula Zahn will succeed Kathleen
Sullivan as co-anchor of ``CBS This Morning'' starting Monday.
   CBS' formal announcement came after two weeks of news reports
that the move was pending. Sullivan indirectly confirmed the shift
during her farewell to viewers Friday. Her CBS contract expires in
November.
   Erik Sorenson, the program's executive producer, said today that
``it wasn't so much that we wanted to replace Kathleen as that we
wanted to get Paula Zahn. It was one of those judgment calls that
you make.''
   Sullivan, 36, was co-host of the show with Harry Smith since it
began in November 1987. Like Zahn, she was a morning news
anchorwoman at ABC before joining CBS.
   Sorenson said CBS officials were impressed with Zahn when she
recently filled in for Joan Lunden on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for a week.
   They called Zahn's agent to ask when her ABC News contract ended
and she'd be available for contract talks, he said. He quoted the
agent, Richard Leibner, as saying there were only eight days in
February when she'd be available.
   Sorenson said he and CBS News president David Burke spent three
days weighing the pros and cons of hiring Zahn, 33, ``and it was
not an easy decision because Kathleen is a helluva broadcaster.''
   However, he said in a phone interview, the show's ratings
``hadn't exactly been going through the roof'' and there was a need
to make a long-range decision for the show.

   The debt-ridden city of Liege is
considering the sale of a Picasso masterpiece to keep its museums
open, an official said.
   ``Either we sell this Picasso or we have to close a dozen
museums for lack of funds,'' Culture alderman Hector Magotte told

   The City Council hopes to make $57 million from the sale of the
1903 painting of the Soler family, a masterpiece of Picasso's
``blue period.''
   The industrial city of 200,000 people on the river Meuse had a
debt of $2.14 billion, but the national government assumed $1.29
billion of that, said city spokesman Andre Cuipers.
   The City Council will make a final decision on the sale next
month.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Tuesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   JAILED MOTHER
   
   The court ruled that parents suspected of child abuse may be
jailed indefinitely for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of
their children.
   The justices said society's need to protect children from harm
generally outweighs a parent's constitutional right against
self-incrimination.
   By a 7-2 vote, the court upheld the indefinite jailing of a
Maryland woman until she tells authorities where her young son can
be found.
   The case is Baltimore Department of Social Services vs.
Bouknight, 88-1182.
   
   SOCIAL WORKERS
   
   The court let stand a ruling that shields government social
workers from being sued for placing children in foster homes where
they are sexually abused.
   The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal
appeals court ruling that the social workers enjoy absolute
immunity if their child-placement decisions were approved by a
court.
   The case is Babcock vs. Tyler, 89-912.
   
   SPEED LIMIT
   
   The court allowed the federal government to withhold federal
highway funds from states that do not comply with a national speed
limit.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by Nevada
officials who want to set the speed limit at 70 mph on some state
highways.
   The case is Nevada vs. Skinner, 89-686.
   
   DISABLED CHILDREN
   
   The court made it easier for disabled children to win some
federal welfare benefits.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices struck down a government regulation
that gave children seeking the benefits less protection than
adults. The Bush administration said the decision could force
officials to re-evaluate bendefits for more than 250,000 children.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Zebley, 88-1377.
   
   DRUG MONEY
   
   The court handed Colorado a defeat in a high-stakes fight with
the federal government over money and other property seized from
drug traffickers.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
proceeds of drug transactions automatically are forfeited to the
federal government. In the case that had been appealed, the
government later transferred nearly all the money to local police
departments.
   The case is Colorado vs. U.S., 89-699.
   
   JURORS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether prosecutors who exclude
blacks as jurors because of their race violate the rights of white
defendants.
   The justices said they will review the case of a white Ohio man,
Larry Joe Powers, convicted of two murders by a state court jury
after seven blacks who could have served as jurors were excluded.
   The case is Powers vs. Ohio, 89-5011.
   
   CHALLENGER SUIT
   
   The court refused to revive a lawsuit by the widow of one of the
seven astronauts who died when the space shuttle Challenger
exploded in 1986.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that shields
the federal government and a NASA engineer from being sued.
   Navy Commander Michael J. Smith was one of the seven killed when
the Challenger exploded 74 seconds after its Jan. 28, 1986 launch.
   His widow, Jane, sued for damages and to bar Morton Thiokol,
manufacturer of the shuttle's booster rockets, from bidding on any
future National Aeronautics and Space Administration projects.
   The case is Smith vs. U.S., 89-607.
   
   SOUTH AFRICA
   
   The court let stand Baltimore, Md., ordinances requiring the
city's public employee pension plans to withdraw all investments in
companies doing business with South Africa.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected a challenge
that said the divestment ordinances, among other things,
impermissibly intrude on the federal government's power to conduct
foreign relations.
   The case is Lubman vs. Mayor and City Council, 89-889.
   
   SCIENTOLOGISTS
   
   The court left intact a ruling that drastically limits the right
of authors to quote unpublished material such as diaries and
letters.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by a
company that published a biography attacking the late L. Ron
Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a ruling last April
that was denounced by scholars, publishers and free-speech
advocates, imposed strict limits on the use of quotations from
unpublished material.
   The case is Holt vs. New Era Publications, 89-869.

   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. today agreed to a
buyout by Georgia-Pacific Corp. for $65.75 a share that would end
the paper product company's four-month fight to remain independent.
   The offer for Great Northern's 57 million outstanding shares
would total some $3.7 billion. It was announced jointly by the
companies and topped Georgia-Pacific's previous $63 a share offer.
   All litigation between the companies will be cancelled, as will
a March meeting at which Great Northern shareholders would have
voted on whether to oust the company's board of directors in favor
of a slate nominated by Georgia-Pacific.
   Great Northern chairman William R. Laidig had said last week his
company was seeking other buyers who would pay more than $63 per
share.
   Today, he issued a statement saying: ``I encourage our employees
to work as enthusiastically with their new associates as they have
in the past to make the combined concern the best in the industry.''
   The merger will create the nation's largest forest products
company, ``with the enhanced strength and flexibility required to
succeed in today's more competitive and global marketplace,'' said
Georgia-Pacific chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr.
   The merged company will have an estimated $14 billion in sales,
about 30 percent higher than its closest competitors, Weyerhaeuser
Inc. and International Paper Co.
   All litigation between the companies will be cancelled, as will
a March meeting at which Great Northern shareholders would have
voted on whether to oust the company's board of directors in favor
of a slate nominated by Georgia-Pacific.
   Great Northern's stock rose $1.50 a share to $65.37{ on the New
York Stock Exchange in midday trading following the announcement.
Georgia-Pacific was down 87{ cents at $44.25 a share.
   The merger is subject to approval by Great Northern shareholders.
   Georgia-Pacific, based in Atlanta, originally bid $58 a share
for Great Northern on Oct. 31, an offer Great Northern rejected as
inadequate and illegal on antitrust grounds.
   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., filed suit in U.S.
District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., alleging the merged company
would have a monopoly in some areas such as check paper.
   Litigation also ensued in federal court in Maine, where Great
Northern is incorporated. That action focused on alleged antitrust
violations as well as the legality of Great Northern's
anti-takeover defenses.
   Georgia-Pacific has agreed to sell some check paper operations
to eliminate one antitrust question.

<TEXT>
   The campaign has been contentious,
filled with threats and accusations of foul play, but international
observers say chances are good that Sunday's election will be clean.
   Credibility is a critical issue in an election that amounts to a
referendum on a decade of Sandinista rule.
   Both sides rely on the observers to ensure a fair election, but
for different reasons.
   President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas expect to win, and
approval by the observers will lend legitimacy. The United National
Opposition, whose presidential candidate is Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, says only international observers will keep the
Sandinistas from cheating.
   More than 1,000 observers are fanning out by jeep, boat, plane
and horseback to watch the election from the first votes cast to
the last counting.
   One of the most visible observers is Jimmy Carter, the former
U.S. president who denounced cheating in last year's Panamanian
election while the votes were being counted. His prestige and anger
helped destroy the credibility of the election, which Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega later nullified.
   The largest observer missions are from the Organization of
American States, which has 450 people, and the United Nations, with
200.
   Nicaragua is the first country to invite U.N. election
observers. Sandinista officials hope a verified victory will bring
better relations with Washington and international aid for an
economy ravaged by mismanagement, war with U.S.-supported Contra
rebels and a U.S. economic embargo.
   ``A credible election can be the foundation for getting us out
of this crisis,'' said Adolfo Beteta, spokesman for the Supreme
Electoral Council. ``There has never been an election with more
observers.''
   Since the Sandinistas overthrew President Anastasio Somoza in
1979, Nicaragua's economy has shrunk by more than half, wages have
fallen to less than 10 percent of their former value and private
consumption is down by 70 percent. The currency was devalued 39
times in 1989.
   Officials of the U.N. and OAS observer missions, and a
representative of Carter's Council of Freely Elected Heads of
Government, have been in Nicaragua for months.
   They have mediated disputes about opposition access to
state-controlled media, use of government resources by the
Sandinistas, intimidation, campaign violence and many other
subjects.
   ``I expect a clean election, but if there are irregularities on
a large scale, we will be able to detect them,'' said Jennifer
McCoy, head of the Carter mission.
   Leonel Zuniga of the OAS said his observers plan to visit 2,500
of the nation's 4,391 polling places. Many unofficial observers
will help, from U.S. congressmen to church workers.
   ``Between the OAS and the other observers, I would guess almost
100 percent of the polling places will be covered,'' Zuniga said.
``We hope for and we expect a clean election.''
   To keep them from voting more than once, citizens will have to
dip their fingers in bright blue ink that takes days to wash off.
To prevent stuffing of ballot boxes, each precinct will be assigned
a number chosen by poll watchers when it opens, and the number will
be stamped on every ballot.
   Ballots will be counted twice, once at the precinct and at one
of nine regional centers. International observers will watch the
counting at many precincts and all regional centers.
   The U.N. and the OAS missions will get copies of the returns,
and will do their own sample counts to check against official
returns.
   Some potential problems still exist. Voter identification cards
do not bear photographs, and each side accuses the other of buying
cards, stealing them or duping people into giving them up.
   Leaders of the opposition alliance, known as UNO, express
concern that their poll watchers will be frightened into resigning
before the election, but say they expect to have people at about 95
percent of the voting stations.
   Angelica Hunt, spokeswoman for the U.N. mission, said: ``We're a
deterrence. Our presence makes a difference, but it's absolutely
essential for UNO and the other opposition parties to have their
poll watchers in place.''

<HEAD>NRC to Vote on License for Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, background; no pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced
today that it will decide on March 1 whether to license the
Seabrook nuclear power plant, setting the stage for an intense
legal battle.
   The commission is expect to approve the licensing, and
challenges to that decision are considered certain.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher said preparations for full-power
operation would begin immediately after a license is issued. He
said the gradual ascension to full-power commercial operation would
take two to three months, although the plant would produce a small
amount of electricity within a month.
   A key question for whatever court handles the promised appeals
to a license would be deciding whether to stay operation of the
plant pending resolution of the appeals.
   The $6.4 billion plant, the scene of huge anti-nuclear
demonstrations in the late 1970s and 1980s, was completed in
mid-1986. It has remained idle for lack of a federal operating
license, mainly because Massachusetts officials contend that the
safety of people living around the plant could not be assured in
case of a major accident.
   The federally mandated 10-mile emergency planning zone around
the 1,150-megawatt reactor includes six Massachusetts communities.
   Challenges to a license also allege flaws in emergency plans for
New Hampshire towns.
   Seabrook critics, including Massachusetts Attorney General James
Shannon, have said the issuance of a license by the NRC is a
foregone conclusion, and that the real fight will be in court.
Shannon and others argue that while NRC officials have deemed
emergency evacuation plans for Seabrook adequate to protect the
public safety, the commission has never spelled out its definition
of adequate.
   Commission Chairman Kenneth Carr said in January that such broad
issues would not be addressed in the NRC decision on Seabrook. Carr
said the decision will instead focus on specific issues directly
relating to the plant.
   A 1979 New Hampshire law targeted at Seabrook bars utilities
from charging their customers for unfinished and canceled power
plants.
   Unable to bill customers for Seabrook and faced with repeated
cost increases and delays, Seabrook's main owner, Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, entered bankruptcy reorganization two
years ago. A proposed settlement calls for Public Service to be
acquired by Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Powell, innovative director of ``The Life
and Death of Colonel Blimp,'' ``The Red Shoes,'' and 30 other
films, has died at age 84.
   Powell, who fell ill two weeks ago in New York, died Monday
night at his home in Avening in Gloucestershire, the National Film
Archive said Tuesday.
   ``Of his generation, he was unquestionably the most innovative
and most creatively brilliant filmmaker this country ever
boasted,'' said fellow director Sir Richard Attenborough. ``He
broke new ground and set standards of quality which almost no other
filmmaker ever did and he will be deeply, deeply missed.''
   Powell was fired from his first film job for dropping
photographic plates, but he later found work as a still
photographer for Alfred Hitchcock, working with him on three silent
films.
   In 1931, Powell directed his first films, ``Two Crowded Hours''
and ``Rynox,'' both 40-minute melodramas.
   Powell and screenwriter Emeric Pressburger, who died in 1988,
formed one of the most creative partnerships in British cinema.
   Their first movie was ``Spy in Black'' in 1938, devised for the
German actor Conrad Veidt. It was titled ``U-Boat 29'' in the
United States.
   ``49th Parallel,'' starring Laurence Olivier, followed in 1940.
Titled ``The Original Story of the Invaders'' in the United States,
it won an Academy Award for best original story (by Pressburger)
and was nominated for best picture and best script.
   In 1941, the partners made ``One of Our Aircraft is Missing''
about British fliers forced to parachute into Nazi-occupied
Holland. The script was nominated for an Academy Award.
   Pressburger and Powell formed the Archers Film Producing Co. in
1942. The team took joint credits for producing, directing and
script, but Powell was largely responsible for directing.
   ``The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp,'' the first Archers'
film, offended Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The 1942 movie was
named after a cartoon character. Britons loathed Blimp-type
bureaucrats who ran offices while others fought, but Churchill
claimed the film was too defeatist.
   ``The Red Shoes'' (1948) was about a ballerina, played by Moira
Shearer in her first screen role. Brian Easdale won an Academy
Award for the film's score, and it was nominated for best picture
and best original story.
   ``The Tales of Hoffman'' in 1951 combined opera, ballet and rich
production design.
   The Archers company disbanded after making two more war movies,
both in 1956, ``The Battle of the River Plate'' (titled ``Pursuit
of the Graf Spee'' in the United States) and ``Ill Met by
Moonlight'' (shown in the United States as ``Night Ambush'').
   Powell and Pressburger remained close friends and in 1972 worked
together on a children's movie, ``The Boy who Turned Yellow.''
   Powell's last film was ``Return to the Edge of the World'' in
1979.
   Powell was born Sept. 30, 1905, in Bekesbourne, near Canterbury
in southeastern England.
   His first wife, Frances, died in 1983. They had two sons.
   In 1984, Powell married Thelma Schoonmaker, who had worked as a
film editor for American director Martin Scorsese.
   A memorial service will be held at an unspecified date.

<HEAD>Dog Wounded While Thwarting Robbery Of Owner and Neighbor</HEAD>

   A 2{-year-old golden retriever leaped at two
armed men and was shot in the shoulder, giving her owner and a
neighbor a chance to run to safety.
   ``There's no question she saved our lives,'' Chris Dittmar said
Monday of his dog, Chelsea, a normally docile, 60-pound pet. The
dog survived and neighbors treated her to a steak.
   Dittmar was near his house chatting with neighbors Bill and
Jeannie Ridlehuber last Thursday night when four young men began
walking up and down driveways. Dittmar told Mrs. Ridlehuber to call
the police. Then two of the men walked up and pulled pistols on him
and Ridlehuber.
   ``They had two guns pointed toward our heads and they told us to
step out into the street,'' Dittmar said. ``And at that moment
Chelsea sensed something wasn't right. She could smell our fear.''
   ``She just leaped between our feet and went after both guys
holding guns,'' Dittmar said. ``They lowered the gun from our heads
and aimed for her instead. I saw her get hit in the shoulder _ I
could see her take the slug.''
   ``She is normally this wonderful, sweet dog but when it counted,
she leaped for the throat and took a bullet in the process,'' said
co-owner Kathy Page.
   After shooting the dog, the gunmen fired three shots at Dittmar
and Ridlehuber, who were able to run into a garage and shut the
door.
   Dittmar grabbed a shotgun from his house and went out in search
of Chelsea.
   ``I called her name and she came limping out of the shadows,''
he said. ``She was scared but she came to me. She just put her head
on my knee and I looked at her and she had blood coming out of her
shoulder and I cradled her underneath the shotgun and took her
home.''
   Veterinarians found that the .38-caliber slug had traveled
beneath Chelsea's skin and lodged against the chest wall, missing
bones and internal organs. The bullet will be removed later this
week.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney arrived Tuesday from
the Philippines seeking what the United States hopes will be a
``sizable increase'' in Japan's $2.4 billion annual support for
American troops stationed here.
   Cheney's visit came as Philippine President Corazon Aquino
signaled a willingness to work out differences over U.S. bases
there, despite her refusal to meet with Cheney during his stay in
Manila the previous three days.
   The defense secretary had a warmer reception in Tokyo.
   ``The Japanese are very understanding and are very willing to
help us as much as they can,'' said a senior Pentagon official
traveling with Cheney.
   And even though it was known that Cheney intended to explore
with Japanese officials possible 10 percent to 12 percent cuts in
U.S. troop levels in Asia, Japanese government spokesman Taizo
Watanabe said officials were not worried by such a development.
   The positive tone set by both sides at the opening of Cheney's
visit was in marked contrast to the scenes he has encountered at
the other major stops on his two-week Asian tour.
   In Manila, the defense secretary was burned in effigy by
demonstrators who protested U.S. military bases in their country.
In Seoul, Cheney met with South Korean officials who were described
as ``horrified'' by his cost-cutting messages and projections of
possible troop reductions.
   Despite the coolness of his Manila stopover, Mrs. Aquino said
Tuesday, ``I welcome the statement of support for this government
and Philippine democracy made by Secretary Cheney on behalf of the
United States.
   ``I also welcome his reiteration that the United States will
make its best efforts to meet its pledge for foreign assistance,''
she said, referring to a $96 million reduction in money for the use
of six military bases this year.
   The military sessions in Tokyo appear free of the tense
wrangling that scars the two nations' economic relations, given
that the United States looks to Japan as the anchor of its Asian
military strategy, and the Japanese prosper under the protective
U.S. military wing.
   ``The Japanese are the linchpin of our military strategy in
Asia,'' the U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``They're very supportive of our presence.''
   Cheney was expected to tell the Japanese what he already has
told the South Koreans _ that he is under congressional pressure to
get them to double over the next three years their financial
support for basing U.S. troops in their countries.
   The official traveling with Cheney said the defense secretary
did not intend to press the Japanese to put forward an exact amount
at this juncture. Each year, the Japanese provide around $2.4
billion of the $7 billion it costs America to base the 50,000
troops here and in Okinawa.
   ``We do not have any numbers. ... We're confident they
understand our requirements,'' the official said, adding, ``We're
hopeful that over the years we'll see a sizable increase in
Japanese support for U.S. forces here.''
   The U.S. official said Washington had received indications of
such increased support from Japanese officials during preliminary
talks leading up to the Cheney visit.
   Pentagon sources have said they are studying plans by which at
least 10,000 to 12,000 troops could be withdrawn from the 120,000
based in the Pacific Rim nations. That would mean a reduction of
5,000 troops in Japan.
   The study is part of a reassessment of the U.S. military role in
the Pacific that Cheney must send to Capitol Hill by April 1. Some
lawmakers are demanding cuts in overseas forces in light of reduced
superpower tensions.
   The official traveling with Cheney said the Japanese didn't
appear to be disturbed by a reduction in non-combatant troops,
given that they face much less of a direct threat than South Korea
does, and also because they are more concerned about the long-term
U.S. presence in their arena.
   ``We understand the U.S. Congress is looking for ways to reduce
government expenditures and as long as (the United States')
fundamental position has not changed, we are not worried,''
Watanabe said.
   Cheney's Japanese counterpart, Juro Matsumoto, also expressed
understanding of the American position. He said that while the
United States may carry out some ``streamlining,'' it has ``no
intention of reducing its fighting strength.''
   Cheney's schedule here is a mix of business and pleasure, as he
lunches with some influential Japanese citizens and visits U.S.
troops at the Yokosuka Naval Base on Wednesday. He confers with
Japanese officials nearly the entire day on Thursday.
   After delivering a speech on U.S.-Asian relations Friday at the
National Press Club, the secretary was to be taken by Japan's famed
high-speed ``Bullet Train'' for a trip to the ancient city of Kyoto.
   He was scheduled to return to Washington on Saturday.

<HEAD>Mayor Asks Cameras to Lay Off Florida Clinic</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 4th graf, Arraignment on, with attorney asking

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for Mayor Marion Barry Jr. says
journalists' harassment of him is getting so bad that one
television reporter tried to sneak into the center where Barry is
being treated for alcohol abuse.
   In a statement issued in Washington by his press secretary,
Barry asked Monday for ``some consideration'' from reporters and
camera crews have who camped outside the Hanley-Hazelden Center in
West Palm Beach, Fla., where the mayor enrolled last month
following his arrest on a drug charge.
   Barry, according to aides, is scheduled to leave the clinic on
Wednesday. City government sources said today he will go to Fenwick
Hall Hospital near Charleston, S.C., to continue treatment although
he still faces arraignment in Washington on an eight-count
indictment on perjury and drug charges.
   Arraignment on the charges had been tentatively set for
Wednesday, but Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, today asked for
a postponement. No specific date was requested.
   Earlier reports had said Barry might go to the Betty Ford Clinic
in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
   In the statement issued Monday, Barry said, ``I am asking the
media to be considerate. ... Members of the media who are camped
outside the treatment center should cease their ... behavior that
is disruptive to all who are here seeking to heal themselves.''
   The mayor's press secretary, Lurma Rackley said the mayor had
complained of ``cameras positioned on top of trucks to shoot over
into the center's courtyard at the patients and that camera
operators and reporters are standing near the entrance of the
center unnerving patients and their relatives who come and go.''
   Rackley said a reporter from WRC-TV in Washington tried to enter
the rehabilitation center over the weekend to check on Barry's
treatment.
   WRC-TV news director Bret Marcus denied the allegation.
   ``Our policy is not to interfere with the treatment or
well-being of Mayor Barry or any other patient at the
Hanley-Hazelden Clinic or any other similar facility,'' Marcus said.
   ``We respect the right and even the necessity of privacy as part
of his medical treatment. We were in Florida reporting on the visit
by City Administrator Carol Thompson and Chief of Staff Maudine
Cooper who were there on official city business.''

   Jurors in the trial of ex-tanker
captain Joseph Hazelwood saw a videotape today of the Exxon Valdez
stranded on a reef, surrounded by a sea of black oil.
   The tape, which graphically depicted the disaster caused when
the tanker struck Bligh Reef last March 24, was introduced in
evidence by the prosecution.
   Daniel Lawn, an environmental engineer with Alaska's Department
of Environmental Conservation, testified that he shot the footage
after he was summoned by the Coast Guard to visit the stricken ship
and record details of the nation's worst oil spill.
   He called the tape ``mental note-taking,'' explaining how he
accompanied Coast Guard investigators to the 987-foot ship.
   The tape, which lasted about 10 minutes, first showed the ship
sitting in the darkness, its lights glowing. The video then
switched to a period after dawn, when the ship's deck was more
visible and a contrast was shown between the gooey black oil on one
side of the tanker and the clear blue water on the other.
   Also visible were chunks of ice which the vessel had sought to
elude in its course into Prince William Sound.
   Long narrated the tape, showingwhich tanks were leaking oil,
saying at one point: ``You can see it bubbling out.''
   The tape was offered as prosecutors began a final barrage of
evidence aimed at proving that Hazelwood, skipper of the ship, was
drunk and reckless the night the tanker went aground.
   After two weeks of testimony from 23 witnesses, assistant
district attorneys Brent Cole and Mary Ann Henry plan to conclude
their case late this week or early next.
   On Friday, Coast Guard Investigator Mark Delozier told of
boarding the grounded tanker in the early morning hours of March 24
and confronting Hazelwood, who smelled of liquor. He said the smell
was ``very intense and very obvious.''
   Delozier also testified that in the captain's quarters he found
two empty cans of a low-alcohol beer. He said there were more cans
of the beer in a refrigerator.
   The defense may cite the presence of the beer to explain why
Hazelwood tested positive on a blood-alcohol test administered 10{
hours after the Exxon Valdez grounding and some 15 hours after he
was seen at a bar in Valdez. The blood test showed Hazelwood had a
blood alcohol level of .061, under the limit for driving in Alaska
but above the federal limit for operating a commercial vessel.
   The 43-year-old skipper is charged with second degree criminal
mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors, reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted, his maximum penalties could be 7\ years in
prison plus $61,000 in fines.
   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, ran aground on jagged Bligh
Reef, gashing holes in its oil tanks and spilling almost 11 million
gallons of oil into the clear waters of Prince William Sound.
   The spill was the nation's largest, killing countless birds,
fish and wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   Delozier's testimony focused on the much-debated question of
whether Hazelwood was drunk at the time of the accident. Testimony
has been inconclusive on how many drinks Hazelwood had during an
afternoon in the town of Valdez before the ship sailed.
   Ship's officers who accompanied him say he had two or three
drinks over a period of about three hours. The prosecution
maintains he was in a bar for about six hours and kept ordering
vodka on the rocks.
   The only point on which all witnesses seem to agree is that
Hazelwood never appeared to be drunk on the Exxon Valdez. Even
Delozier, who smelled alcohol on him, said he did not stagger, slur
his words or appear impaired by alcohol.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone was considering a
prosecution proposal to call as witnesses experts who claim they
can tell from listening to tape recordings of a person's voice
whether they are intoxicated. Prosecutors want the experts to give
their opinions about Hazelwood from listening to the tape of the
skipper reporting the Exxon Valdez grounding to the U.S. Coast
Guard.

   A settlement was reached today in a
negligence case against a 92-year-old widow who stood to lose her
home and life savings for helping her nephew buy a car that later
was involved in a serious accident.
   Luella Wilson refused all pre-trial settlements, proclaiming,
``I want a trial by jury.'' Arriving at the courthouse this
morning, Wilson said she would take the stand in her own defense
``if I am able.
   ``It's the only way I can clear my name,'' she said. ``I didn't
do nothing wrong. It's terrible what happened to that boy, but I'm
not responsible for what happened.''
   Details of the settlement were not released, but Wilson claimed
victory, saying she will keep her home and property. The agreement
came during the noon hour, after lawyers had presented opening
arguments and testimony had begun.
   Wilson had been found negligent for giving her great-nephew
money to buy a car that later was involved in an accident that left
a man partially paralyzed. The case was being heard again to decide
if that negligence should be shared.
   On Monday, Wilson was presented with a number of settlement
offers, most of which would have left her home and assets to the
accident victim when she died.
   She refused them all. ``My husband Harry would roll over in his
grave if I ever did that,'' she said.
   The trial struck a sympathetic chord with the public because
Wilson stood to lose $950,000, the value of her home, 80 acres of
property and her savings. After her story appeared in newspapers
and on television, Wilson received letters of support and cash from
around the nation.
   Legal experts and professional groups, including bankers and car
dealerships, kept a close eye on the case because it could mark a
legal precedent for negligence.
   Had the trial gone to the jury, Wilson, an automobile dealership
and its president would have had to prove they were not negligent
in helping Wilson's great-nephew, Willard Stuart, buy a car in 1984.
   Stuart had no drivers' license or insurance at the time.
   Shortly after he bought the car, Stuart drove it off a bridge
after drinking beer and whiskey and smoking marijuana with a group
of young men, including Mark Vince, according to court records.
   Vince, a back-seat passenger, was partially paralyzed as a
result of the accident and later had one leg amputated. He sued
Wilson for negligence, under the legal concept of negligent
entrustment, for giving her nephew $6,300 to buy the 1981 Chrysler
LeBaron.
   Prosecutors claimed that Wilson was negligent not by buying the
car outright, but by providing the money for the nephew to purchase
it. A 1987 Superior Court jury agreed, and awarded Vince $950,000.
   Wilson was too ill to attend that trial.
   While refusing to reverse that decision on appeal, the Vermont
Supreme Court later ruled that a jury should decide if Ace Auto of
Bennington and its president and salesman in the deal, Gary
Gardner, should share the liability for selling the car to Stuart.
   After the high court's ruling, Superior Court Judge Arthur O'Dea
opened the way for a retrial, saying jurors could also decide if
Vince shares the liability for entering the car when he knew the
driver had been drinking and smoking marijuana.

   With banks closed for the third week,
Finns are learning to live without cash _ or with bags of it.
   Commercial, savings and deposit banks were shut Feb. 1 in a wage
dispute that has been unusual in its intensity for this
Scandinavian country known for quiet negotiation and consensus.
Only the Post Office bank, which has its own union, remained open.
   The cash flow problems are causing many small businesses to
suffer, and many layoffs are looming.
   Bank customers had plenty of warning before the financial
institutions actually closed their doors, and most took precautions.
   ``When I knew the banks were going to shut I withdrew all my
money and keep it in a box at home,'' said office worker Kaisa
Harris. ``But with all that cash lying around, I'm actually
spending more than I would normally.''
   Supermarket-owner Veikko Still, unable to deposit his daily
receipts, said he carries around bags filled with money to pay his
70 employees.
   ``Often we have up to a million marks ($250,000) in cloth
bags,'' according to Still, who adds that he has tripled his
insurance and increased security.
   Police said there has been a sharp increase in burglaries and
warned companies not to move large amounts of money. In some cases,
police provided armed escorts on paydays.
   Many shoppers are living on credit and business has barely
slowed in downtown Helsinki. Electronics stores reported normal
post-Christmas sales. Restaurants, bars and movie houses are as
full as ever.
   Hotels and most retail stores still accept credit and bank
cards, even though they cannot collect until the banks reopen. In
1988, there were 4.5 million credit cards, one for every Finn.
   Others stores provide interest-free credit of several months
with no down payment for expensive consumer goods.
   Small- and medium-sized companies, however, are feeling the
squeeze as salaries, taxes and various tariffs must be paid.
   Jussi Jarventaus, vice-president of the Central Association of
Finnish Entrepreneurs, said 400 workers have been issued warnings
they may lose their jobs, and some firms have gone bankrupt.
   ``These figures will be multiplied by a significant amount if
the government does not come to our assistance. We are dealing with
a very dangerous situation,'' he said.
   Trade officials said imports were dropping by 50 percent as
companies were being forced to pay import duties in cash.
   More than 95 percent of businesses in Finland are as small or
medium-sized, employing fewer than 20 people. Only 0.2 percent
employ more than 500 people, Jarventaus said.
   ``We can survive for just a couple of weeks, that's all,'' said
Kai Bjorn, manager of a furniture-installing company that already
has told 10 of its 16 workers they may have to be let go.
   ``We have been in this business for two years now and have been
growing at a steady, promising rate. Now everything is in danger of
falling apart,'' Bjorn said.
   He reported an 80 percent drop in orders and a sharp fall in
income because customers can't pay.
   The Finance Ministry rejected a new appeal Tuesday by the
Central Association of Finnish Entrepreneurs to waive taxation and
other duties to be paid by small- and medium-sized companies.
   According to Finance Minister Ulla Puolanne, most companies are
not in such deep trouble to warrant special measures, national
radio reported.
   Jarventaus told the radio that he was surprised by the
ministry's decision.
   The bank dispute involving 38,000 workers is over demands for a
10 percent wage increase. State Mediator Jorma Reini said he
expected the banks to stay closed a long time.
   Bank employees, who earn an average monthly salary of about
$2,000, claim their income has lagged behind that of other workers.
They said they wouldn't budge from their demand for a 10 percent
increase and have rejected an offer of 6.2 percent.
   Postpankki, the state-owned Post Office Bank, has become a
safety valve for the public.
   Postpankki has regular banking customers, and also provides cash
and bill payment services for anyone in 3,000 post offices
throughout the country.
   Assistant Director Ara Hopia said Postpankki has opened up to 10
times the normal number of new accounts since the bank strike.
Offices have been forced to lock their doors for a few hours every
day to deal with backlogs and massive lines of customers.
   ``It's ridiculous _ our workload has suddenly doubled, in some
cases even trebled or more,'' Hopia said. ``Something has got to
give soon _ we can't take this for very much longer.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met Tuesday
with World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman and pledged to
oppose anti-Semitism in Poland.
   Bronfman, continuing a visit to Poland that included meetings
Monday with President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, also traveled to the Auschwitz concentration
camp in southern Poland.
   ``There is nothing to be said here, only the wail remains,''
Bronfman wrote in the visitors' book at the camp where officials
estimate up to 2.5 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during
World War II.
   During the meeting with Walesa, Bronfman expressed concern about
what he termed a reappearance of anti-Semitism in Poland.
   Noting that there are only 10,000 Jews left in all of Poland,
compared with a pre-World War II population of 3.5 million, he said
it was unprecedented for anti-Semitism to remain in a country where
there are so few Jews.
   He asked Walesa for a public condemnation of anti-Semitism.
   ``I have condemned anti-Semitism everywhere,'' Walesa replied.
``I have always been doing so and I will do so.''
   Walesa called it ``a great loss that there are so few Jews in
Poland.''
   Jews have lived in Poland for nearly 1,000 years and made up 10
percent of Poland's population before World War II. But despite
that long history of coexistence, relations between Polish
Catholics and Polish Jews have often been marked by tension and
hostility.
   The Solidarity-led government of Mazowiecki has pledged to
improve Polish-Jewish relations and oppose any resurgence of
anti-Semitism.
   It plans to restore diplomatic relations with Israel next week,
and has moved to speed up construction of an alternate home for
Roman Catholic nuns whose convent next to Auschwitz has offended
Jews and others.

   The National Reception Committee, which has coordinated
Mandela's schedule since he was released Feb. 11 after 27 years in

Tuesday, he will go to Lusaka, Zambia, where he will meet with
exiled ANC leaders.
   Jan Lundvik, a representative of the Swedish legation in South
Africa, said after a meeting at Mandela's Soweto home that
preparations were being made for his forthcoming visit to Sweden.
ANC president Oliver Tambo, Mandela's former law partner, is
recovering from a stroke in Stockholm.
   Chief Anderson Joyi, a leader of the delegation of chiefs from
Tembuland in the Transkei homeland, said they had come to ask
Mandela to visit the graves of his dead relatives in the
Xhosa-speaking homeland. Mandela is a member of the Tembu royal
clan of the Xhosa tribe and grew up in Transkei. The South African
government declared Transkei an independent republic during his
imprisonment for sabotage, but its military ruler is considering a
referendum on rejoining South Africa.

   A team of surgeons worked about 10 hours today
to replace the diseased liver of 12-year-old Stormie Jones, who
became the world's first recipient of a heart-liver transplant six
years ago.
   Lead surgeon Andreas Tzakis and six other doctors started the
operation at 3:15 a.m. and finished at about 1 p.m., hospital
officials said. Transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl was present
for part of the procedure.
   ``The word was everything went fine,'' said Children's Hospital
spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. Stormie was listed in critical condition,
considered normal following transplant surgery.
   Stormie and her mother, Lois Purcell, flew to Pittsburgh from
their home in the Dallas suburb of White Settlement, Texas, on
Monday, arriving at the hospital about 7 p.m.
   As she was wheeled from her plane to a waiting ambulance,
Stormie joked, ``I feel like I'm in a straitjacket'' because of the
stretcher's confining straps.
   Doctors were optimistic because a donor liver was found only a
week after Stormie's name was placed on the nationwide transplant
list. The success rate of a second liver transplant is estimated at
65 percent to 70 percent, hospital officials said.
   Hepatitis damaged Stormie's first transplanted liver and the
organ no longer functions normally, said McMahon.
   Hepatitis, which is caused by a viral infection, inflames the
liver.
   ``She was last hospitalized here in January,'' McMahon said.
``The doctors suspected a virus or hepatitis at that time. They
feel at this time their only option is another liver transplant.''
   Stormie's first transplant on Valentine's Day 1984 took 16 hours
and was headed by Starzl, who replaced the girl's heart and liver
with those of a 4-year-old girl who had died in a New York car
accident.
   Before that operation, Stormie suffered two heart attacks and
underwent two triple coronary bypass operations.
   She suffered from a rare congenital disease which increased to
10 times normal the level of cholesterol in her blood. The
imbalance was caused by a faulty liver.
   Pittsburgh surgeons followed Stormie's 1984 operation with two
more attempts at heart-liver transplants, but both patients died
within a few days of surgery.
   Those were the only attempts in America at replacing a heart and
liver in the same operation until last Dec. 3, when Pittsburgh
surgeons performed the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant.
The patient, Cindy Martin, 26, remains in critical condition in the
intensive care unit at Presbyterian-University Hospital.
   She is receiving FK-506, an experimental Japanese drug, and has
experienced no organ rejection.
   Stormie had no serious complications until October 1988, when
Children's Hospital doctors removed a bile duct obstruction. She
started losing liver function and returned to Children's Hospital
in November.

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Asks Curbs on Unsanctioned Demonstrations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature on Tuesday urged a
crackdown on illegal demonstrations scheduled for Sunday and said
authorities should exercise tight control on legal rallies, the
Tass news agency reported.
   The legislators, saying they feared that extremists and criminal
elements will exploit the demonstrations to destabilize the
political situation, adopted a resolution urging law enforcement
agencies to take special measures to keep demonstrators in line.
   The rallies were organized by various political groups in
Moscow, Leningrad and other major cities ``to express their
attitude to changes taking place in the country,'' Tass said.
   ``As far as newspaper reports indicate, forces interested in
destabilizing the situation also intend to join the
demonstrators,'' the news agency said.
   The resolution, introduced in the Supreme Soviet legislature by
Deputy Nikolai Pivovarov, said unsanctioned rallies should be
curbed and legal demonstrations be held in specifically assigned
places.
   ``In order to prevent actions by militants and, possibly
criminal forces, the Supreme Soviet has asked the government and
local authorities to adopt all necessary measures to protect law
and order,'' Tass said.
   The news agency quoted several deputies as saying there had been
an increase in demonstrations under the ``perestroika'' reforms of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and that many of them had taken on
an anti-state character, with some demonstrators exhorting people
to violence.
   ``The predominant motive of many rallies is usually `down with
something' or `away with something,''' an unidentified deputy and
member of the Committee on Glasnost was quoted as saying during the
debate on the resolution.
   ``Anti-state remarks that sometimes contain open appeals for
violence have become a permanent fixture of their vocabulary,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   Tass said the resolution was adopted after the debate, but did
not break down the vote.
   The Supreme Soviet on Tuesday also approved a bill that would
allow individuals to own land, but sent it to committee for
refinement before voting on an article-by-article basis that is
expected next week.
   Land currently is the property of the state, and passage of the
law would also require reworking of the Constitution. Some
lawmakers expressed concern the law could disrupt farm production.
   A law that would allow individuals to hold private property was
sent back to a committee for revision last week. Both bills are
intended to unleash individual initiative by giving citizens a
greater say in how they live.

   The director of UNESCO said in a meeting Tuesday
with the sister of Terry Anderson that the U.S. journalist and the
17 other Westerners being held hostage in Lebanon must not be
allowed to slip into oblivion.
   Federico Mayor expressed the hope that ``these victims of
violence'' would be released soon.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, said she was aware of the many
efforts of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization to secure the release of her brother and the other
hostages, ``and I made this trip to Paris to say thank you and
express my appreciation.''
   Mayor has sent personal representatives to the Middle East to
try to determine the fate of the hostages, and also spoken about
them with ambassadors to UNESCO from countries in the area.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985, and is believed
held by Shiite Moslem extremists with close ties to Iran. He has
been held longest of the Western captives, who include seven otehr
Americans.
   Mrs. Say is accompanied by Larry Heinzerling, deputy director of
World Services for the AP, which supports her efforts financially
and logistically while pressing its own efforts for Anderson's
freedom.
   She is on a ``humanitarian pilgrimage'' to gather international
support for the release of Anderson and the other hostages. Mrs.
Say has met with Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-general of the
Uited Nations; Pope John Paul II; and Yasser Arafat, chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Mayor, citing the upheaval in Eastern Europe and changes in
South Africa, and said his impression was that those holding the
hostages ``cannot continue going against the winds of history.''
   He said Mrs. Say's trip might lead national leaders to realize
``that this situation must come to an end. There is no
justification for it continuing.''
   She presented Mayor with a prayer bracelet bearing her brother's
name and a quotation from the Bible to ``remember those in prison.''
   Mrs. Say leaves Paris on Wednesday for Damascus to meet with the
Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
   After that, she will go to London to see Robert Runcie, the
archbishop of Canterbury. Runcie's personal envoy, Terry Waite,
disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his Beirut hotel to
negotiate with kidnappers for the release of Anderson and other
Americans.

   Actress Kim Basinger hooked up with a
Chicago company to help pay the $20 million price tag for this
Georgia town.
   Her partner is American Information Technologies, one of seven
so-called baby Bells formed in the breakup of American Telephone &amp;
Telegrah Co.
   ``We have invested in the property in and around Braselton,''
company spokesman Steve Ford told the Gwinnett Daily News in an
interview published Tuesday.
   ``We're investing where we think there's an opportunity for good
long-term growth,'' he said.
   Neither the company, known as Ameritech, nor Miss Basinger would
disclose details of the partnership.
   The founding family of Braselton, which is near Miss Basinger's
native Athens, agreed last March to sell the actress about 1,700
acres _ the bulk of the small town in northeast Georgia.
   Among property included in the deal is a bank, an industrial
park, 50 other buildings and two miles of interstate highway
frontage. Tentative development plans include a movie studio, said
Charles Sheron, a local developer.
   Miss Basinger, 36, was featured in the movies ``Batman,'' ``My
Stepmother is an Alien'' and ``9{ Weeks.''

   Actress Mariel Hemingway and other

overhead dustings.
   Actor John Ratzenberger, who portrays letter carrier Cliff
Clavin on ``Cheers,'' and actress Allyce Beasley, who played
secretary Agnes Dipesto on ``Moonlighting,'' also turned out for a
demonstration Monday at the federal building on the city's west
side.
   ``It seems those politicians with a head-in-the-sand attitude
are building a gallows with this issue, and I'm more than happy to
be standing up there with the rope,'' Ratzenberger said.
   The state is spraying 400 square miles of Los Angeles and Orange
counties to wipe out the worst infestation of the crop-destroying
bug since 1981-82. Helicopters drop a mixture of the pesticide
malathion and sticky corn syrup bait.
   Leon Spaugy, agriculture commissioner for Los Angeles County,
has repeatedly contended the spraying is safe. He says it will be
stopped when the state can find enough sterile Medflies to stall
breeding.
   Critics say too little is known about malathion's long-term
effects on humans.

<HEAD>White House Was Aware of Terrorists' Missile Threat at Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Tuesday that the Secret
Service had known there was a possibility that drug terrorists had
surface-to-air missiles when President Bush flew to Colombia for
last week's four-nation drug summit. Ten such weapons were seized
by Colombian police Monday.
   ``There was intelligence before we left of various kinds about
missiles and rockets and other kinds of equipment, about people
with various plans,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But he added that the reports were difficult to confirm at the
time.
   The weapons seized Monday in a raid on a Bogota drug hidout were
capable of downing large aircraft. Two men were arrested.
   Bush's meeting Thursday with presidents Virgilio Barco of
Colombia, Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia in
the port city of Cartagena was held amid extremely tight security.
   Security preparations included manuevers to lessen the chance of
a missile attack on the presidential aircraft.
   Air Force One did not fly directly into Cartagena, where the
approach would have been over land, but into a more secure airport
in Barranquilla, where the approach was over the sea. Hhis
helicopter then flew fast and low into Cartagena, accompanied by
four other copters that zigzagged in a diversionary pattern.
   The helicopters took a roundabout route to stay over water as
much as possible.
   Bush had brushed aside concerns of some senior aides in deciding
to attend the summit. The officials expressed deep relief on the
return trip once Air Force One was out of Colombian air space.
   Fitzwater, who was asked at his daily White House news briefing
about the weapons seizure, said warnings that the terrorists had
shoulder-held SA-7 missiles and might use them against the
president were not deemed to be ``confirmable information.''
   ``There's intelligence suggesting all kinds of capabilities that
always have to be matters of concern, but nothing that we could
confirm, ...'' he said.
   ``Suffice to say that the Secret Service was aware of these
kinds of activities there, but I would not specifically say what we
knew and didn't know, '' Fitzwater said.
   ``We don't talk about security information because we don't want
others to know how much we know and how we find it out and how we
work with other governments to get these kinds of information. And,
... for political reasons, it does no good to try to embarrass the
host country,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>Angola, Cuba Agree to Resume Cuban Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola and Cuba agreed Tuesday to resume a
withdrawal of Cuban troops from the African nation, one month after
the pullout was suspended, the Angolan foreign minister said.
   The withdrawal of the estimated 28,000 Cubans still in Angola
would start again Sunday to comply with U.S.-brokered regional
peace accords signed in December 1988 by the two countries and
South Africa, said Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro Van Dunem.
   ``It is a sovereign decision of Angola and Cuba ... that
reflects our political maturity,'' he said.
   Van Dunem headed the Angolan delegation at talks with Cuba that
began Monday and led to the decision, which also was announced by
the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina.
   Havana suspended the troop withdrawal Jan. 25, after four Cubans
died in an attack by rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, known as UNITA. The incident occurred in
western Angola above the 13th parallel, currently the southernmost
limit for Havana's soldiers, according to the peace accord.
   Van Dunem said the two nations adopted a declaration requesting
U.S. guarantees to prevent the rebel attacks on Cubans. He said the
attacks endangered the New York accords.
   Van Dunem also criticized U.S. aid to UNITA, and what he called
Washington's ``not very positive'' attitude toward Angola's Marxist
government.
   ``We would like the United States to cease its interference in
the Angolan question,'' van Dunem said. ``We're sure that if they
want to use their influence with UNITA, there will be no more
attacks on Cubans.''
   UNITA chief Jonas Savimbi, in a broadcast on the rebels' Black
Cockerel radio Tuesday, said there was no proof Cuban soldiers
fought in a recent government offensive.
   He said he sent a letter to Cuban leader Fidel Castro
apologizing for the January attack in which seven Cubans were also
wounded.
   ``We guaranteed (Castro) the death of the Cuban soldiers was
involuntary and that no such incident will be repeated,'' Savimbi
said, ``It's in our interests that the Cubans go home.''
   UNITA receives a reported $50 million a year in U.S. assistance,
including sophisticated ground-to-air Stinger missiles.
   The government forces are equipped with Soviet weapons.
   More than 31,000 Cubans of an estimated 50,000 were withdrawn
before the Jan. 25 suspension. Under the New York accords, 33,000
are to have left by April 1. All are to be gone by mid-1991.
   Fighting has flared in recent weeks in southeast Angola, where
government and rebel troops are battling for control of a strategic
airstrip and rebel base near Mavinga, 700 miles southeast of Luanda.
   A UNITA statement Tuesday in Lisbon, Portugal, said rebels
attacked government soldiers carrying supplies to troops near
Mavinga. It said Monday that rebels bombarded a government garrison
at Cuito Cuanavale, 90 miles to the northwest.
   The statement repeated rebel claims that Soviet-supplied
government planes were dropping chemical bombs behind UNITA lines,
south of Mavinga.
   A separate UNITA statement said seven experts from Austria,
Belgium, France and Spain arrived Tuesday at rebel headquarters in
Jamba, 120 miles south of Mavinga, to verify the claims.
   UNITA also said its forces killed 13 government fighters Sunday
at Barraca garrison, Bengo province, near Luanda.
   There was no independent confirmation of the claims, but the
Angolan state news agency said 10 rebels died in clashes in central
Huambo, Cuanza South and Benguela provinces last week.
   The battle for Mavinga, said to be the heaviest in the 15-year
conflict, has darkened hopes of getting government and rebel
representatives back to the negotiating table.
   Peace talks collapsed only weeks after Savimbi and President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos sealed a truce before 18 African leaders at
Gbadolite, Zaire, on June 22.
   The rebels have sabotaged power and water supplies to Luanda
several times in the past month.
   UNITA has been fighting to force the government to share power
since shortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in
1975.

   New shipments of sparkling Perrier water will
arrive on French shelves March 1 bearing a special label showing
they were bottled after last week's worldwide recall, the company
said Tuesday.
   Source Perrier SA told its domestic distributors that its
representatives would visit them in the next week to collect
bottles withdrawn from sale.
   Perrier representatives at the company's headquarters were
unavailable to say when the bottled water might return to the
United States and other foreign markets.
   When the recall was announced Feb. 14, company executives said
2{ months might be needed to withdraw 160 million bottles from sale
in 120 countries and replace them with water without the
cancer-causing chemical benzene.
   Traces of benzene have been discovered in Perrier samples in
several countries, including the United States, where 72 million
bottles have been pulled off the shelves.
   Benzene entered Perrier's bottling line at Vergeze in southern
France when workers failed to replace a filter that carries carbon
dioxide gas from the underground spring to the plant, executives
said. The benzene occurs naturally, they said.
   The recall operation is expected to cost the company $200
million.

<HEAD>Fresh MiGs Sent To Cuba; US Concerned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Tuesday that Cuba
has received a new shipment of high-performance Soviet fighter
planes that the United States ``simply cannot tolerate'' such
developments.
   Under questioning, department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
denied that the statement constituted a threat to Cuba. She
referred reporters to recent testimony before a Soviet legislative
committee by Secretary of State James A. Baker III in which he said
Cuba posed no threat to the United States.
   In confirming a delivery of new MiG-29 jet fighters, Ms.
Tutwiler gave no figure. The Washington Times, which reported the
shipment in Tuesday's editions, put the number at six.
   The report said the combined total of MiGs in Cuba's arsenal has
now risen to more than 300, most of them older models.
   Ms. Tutwiler noted Baker had told the Soviet legislators during
a visit to Moscow two weeks ago that the United States has
difficulty understanding why the Kremlin continues to send MiG-29s
to Cuba, particularly at a time when Cuba has been so critical of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform policies.
   Ms. Tutwiler also quoted Baker as saying, ``Cuba is actively
supporting the insurgency in El Salvador and it is these kind of
activities close to the shores of the United States that we simply
cannot tolerate.''
   Initially, Ms. Tutwiler dismissed as ``hypothetical'' a question
as to whether the statement was meant as a threat to Cuba. She
later said no threat had been intended.
   Ms. Tutwiler also attached little significance to the internal
reforms announced recently by the Cuban Communist Party.
   She said the reforms appear aimed at consolidating the strength
of Cuba's one-party system.
   The announcement, Ms. Tutwiler added, ``distances Cuba from the
current wave of reform sweeping Eastern Europe by rejecting any
attempt to duplicate foreign models, permit democratic processes or
allow a multi-party system.
   ``In other words, the Cuban government seems committed to
maintaining a rigid, one-party Marxist-Leninist dictatorship, the
very system which socialist states in other parts of the world are
now reforming.''

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces reinforced their
positions Tuesday and mediators sought ways to end a 3-week-old war
for supremacy that has killed more than 650 people, most of them
civilians.
   A cease-fire agreed upon Saturday by Gen. Michel Aoun and Samir
Geagea, commander of the Lebanese Forces militia, appeared to be
holding. Sniper fire could be heard throughout the day in Christian
east Beirut, but no major battles were reported.
   The 19,000 troops loyal to Aoun trucked in large quantities of
arms and ammunition to bases in the east Beirut districts of Furn
el-Shubbak, Tahwita and Horsh Tabet.
   In adjacent Ashrafiyeh, one of two militia strongholds in east
Beirut, Lebanese Forces chief of staff Fuad Malek inspected
positions and said his men were prepared to fight on if necessary.
   ``The Lebanese Forces fighters are ready ... to teach the
attackers a new lesson,'' said Malek, a retired army major general.
``Ashrafiyeh cannot be taken.''
   Ashrafiyeh, on Beirut's highest hill, commands the network of
roads linking areas held by Aoun with Beirut port, which the
militia controls.
   Aoun appeared to have backed off a weekend ultimatum to Geagea
to surrender the port and east Beirut's Karantina district, his
headquarters area next to Ashrafiyeh, by Tuesday night or face an
all-out assault.
   A source close to the three-member mediation committee said it
had succeeded ``in extending the truce on a day-to-day basis,'' but
that amounted to little more than ``the hope that an agreement of
some sort might emerge.''
   Aoun attacked Geagea on Jan. 30, trying to establish sole
authority over the 310-square-mile enclave east and north of
Beirut, where 1 million Christians live. The Lebanese forces, with
6,000 regulars and thousands of reservists, is Lebanon's largest
Christian militia.
   Police say 667 people had been killed and 1,872 wounded in the
worst fighting between Christians in a Moslem-Christian civil war
that has cost more than 150,000 lives since April 1975.
   The general's forces control about one-third of the Christian
enclave and Geagea holds the rest.
   They agreed Monday to a six-point plan designed to consolidate
the truce, but it falls far short of an overall settlement. Many
observers see it as a temporary compromises allowing both sides to
regroup.
   Geagea agreed to formation of an eight-man ``national
authority'' in the enclave under Aoun's leadership, the source
close to the mediators said, but he added: ``Even if Aoun goes
along with this, it would not mean that a political settlement has
been reached.''
   He said there were ``no indications'' Aoun would drop his demand
the Lebanese Forces be disbanded and turned into a political party,
or that Geagea would accept it.
   Mediators met with Aoun Tuesday in his bunker beneath the
shattered presidential palace in Baabda, a Christian suburb east of
Beirut.
   President Elias Hrawi, elected by Parliament in November with a
mandate to implement a Lebanese peace plan Aoun opposes, dismissed
him as military commander but the general will not step aside. Aoun
does not recognize Hrawi's authority and refuses to turn over the
presidential palace.

   A truck loading liquefied petroleum gas
into a storage tank caught fire and exploded at an Amoco Oil Co.
refinery Tuesday, killing two people and injuring three others,
authorities said.
   The accident occurred shortly before 10 a.m. near the main
storage area of the refinery, prompting evacuations of nearby
residents and closing streets and highways.
   No storage tanks were ignited, Amoco spokeswoman Lisa Houghton
said.
   The names of the dead were not immediately released.
   Amoco firefighters brought the blaze under control by noon,
authorities said.
   Ms. Houghton said five trucks were in the loading area at the
time of the blast.
   Three truck drivers were taken to St. Catherine Hospital in
nearby East Chicago, where they were in fair condition with
undisclosed injuries, said Donna Yanas, a hospital spokeswoman.
   Two other drivers who were in the area were not injured, Ms.
Houghton said.
   Pablo Unat, a police dispatcher, said about 100 people within a
one-mile radius of the fire were evacuated. A church and school
were made available to them.

   Americans love to eat, but many spice their
pleasure with a splash of worry and a dash of guilt, a Gallup poll
released Tuesday indicates.
   More than nine in 10 respondents to the telephone survey said
they enjoy food and nearly six in 10 said they enjoy it a lot.
   At the same time, 56 percent said they worry about fat and
cholesterol in the foods they eat.
   Women were more conscious of their diets and also more worried
about chowing down. More than four in 10 of the women surveyed said
they feel guilty about eating foods they like. Fewer than three in
10 men agreed.
   There were other disparities between the sexes.
   Seventy percent of the women said they were eating more fiber
and 57 percent of the men said the same thing. Six in 10 women were
consuming more calcium. Fewer than four in 10 men joined them.
   Nearly three-quarters of those surveyed said they were trimming
fat from their diets and roughly two-thirds reported cutting back
on saturated fats, cholesterol and fried foods.
   The Gallup Organization conducted the survey of 772 American
adults Dec. 11-28 for the American Dietetic Association and
International Food Information Council.
   The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.

   Buckling up may pay off some day in
West Virginia.
   State Sen. Ned Jones introduced a bill Monday that would give
police officers the authority to hand out lottery tickets to
belt-wearing motorists.
   The bill would exclude drunken drivers or motorists who violate
the speed limit by more than 10 mph.
   It would be up to the state police to figure out how to dole out
the lottery tickets, which would not be awarded unless everyone in
an auto had their seat belts on.
   The Legislature recently voted down a bill to require motorists
to wear seat belts. Jones said his approach is just the ticket.
   ``Now we're using the carrot instead of the stick,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tukwila: the Town, the Newspaper Column, and Rex and Debby</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suburb of Tukwila has achieved fame, or
embarrassment, with a newspaper column that has made the town a
euphemism for an act between two consenting adults.
   Reaction in Tukwila to the town's new civic image ranges from
rage to amusement, and some folks feel any advertising for the town
is good advertising.
   It began when Seattle Times columnist Eric Lacitis wrote
recently about Rex and Debby Allen, who volunteered the information
that they had sex 500 times in nine months last year. They kept
track on their calendar, Mrs. Allen said.
   Lacitis decided to use the euphemism ``visiting Tukwila'' for
the activity in which the Allens engaged so often.
   The Allens are considering printing bumper stickers reading:
``Have You Gone to Tukwila Today?''
   But the Tukwila City Council denounced the column.
   ``We're tired of Tukwila being known as the Rodney Dangerfield
of King County _ we get no respect,'' declared Councilman Clarence
Moriwaki.
   ``Whenever people need something to poke fun at, they think of
Tukwila,'' said Councilman Joe Duffie. ``It's a big disgrace to the
city.''
   A local television comedy show, ``Almost Live,'' created a skit
called ``Visiting Tukwila,'' which produced such other euphemisms
for the same activity: ``Riding the Monorail,'' ``Working at
Boeing'' and ``Shooting Herschel,'' the collective name given
troublesome sea lions that eat steelhead trout swimming through on
their way to spawn.
   Tukwila was previously most famous as the site of a shopping
mall, and City Administrator John McFarland commented: ``Any
publicity that's in fun or positive we don't mind.'' He noted that
Tukwila is derived from an Indian phrase meaning ``land of the
hazelnuts.''
   Carlo Macri, a 26-year Tukwila resident, also said the free
advertising is just fine.
   ``I'm not offended at all,'' he said in an interview at a local
bar. ``The more recognition we get, the better.''
   In the meantime, Allen, 37, an engineering inspector, and his
wife, a 29-year-old technician, have set a goal of 750 visits to
Tukwila for 1990.
   ``There are worse things we could do,'' Mrs. Allen said.

   Space shuttle Atlantis, due to lift
off Thursday on a secret military mission, faces a 70 percent
chance of delay due to threatening high winds, clouds and
thunderstorms, NASA said Tuesday.
   Despite the dismal forecast, NASA officials said the countdown
that began Sunday was continuing smoothly.
   ``Everything's still going smoothly ... no hitches whatsoever,''
said space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone. ``Weather is the only
issue right now.''
   Forecasters said a front that moved through Monday night had
stalled south of Cape Canaveral and was expected to shift back to
the north on Wednesday night. On Monday, the weather forecast had
been 60 percent favorable but dropped overnight as the weather
system advanced.
   A low cloud cover prevented the astronauts from taking part
early Tuesday morning in routine practice flights aboard a shuttle
training aircraft. Instead, the five men reviewed flight data and
prepared for a possible practice flight Wednesday, NASA spokesman
Kyle Herring said.
   The astronauts were in bed by early afternoon, adjusting their
hours to match the sleep time they will have in space, from about
noon to 8 p.m.
   Because of the secrecy surrounding the mission, NASA was not
providing precise countdown information and would say only that
liftoff will occur between midnight and 4 a.m. Thursday. It will
make the count public nine minutes before the planned blastoff.
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said Atlantis will
lift off at 1 a.m.
   Atlantis is the sixth flight in 34 missions dedicated solely to
a national security payload. Officials say the secrecy makes it
harder for Soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship off Cape
Canaveral to track the shuttle and learn its mission.
   The sources said the astronauts are to deploy a 37,300-pound
satellite to snap high-resolution reconnaissance photos and to
listen in on military and diplomatic communications around the
world.
   They said the shuttle will be launched into an orbit that will
fly over most of the Soviet Union.
   The satellite, known by the code name AFP-731, and other
reconniassance spacecraft will help verify whether the Soviets are
complying with U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreements being forged. The
Soviets have their own spy satellites to monitor U.S. compliance.
   Navy Capt. John O. Creighton is commanding the crew. The other
astronauts are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and
mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.

<HEAD>Health Secretary Puts Cost of Smoking to Society at $52 Billion a
Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan continued his
campaign against tobacco companies Tuesday and issued a report
showing that smoking costs the country more than $52 billion
annually in health care costs and lost productivity.
   Sullivan condemned tobacco company advertising practices that
target women, minorities and young people, saying ``they must stop
their irresponsibility.''
   In testimony before the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, he also called on advertising agencies to join
anti-smoking efforts by renouncing tobacco ads and said television
stations should donate free air time to help educate viewers about
the dangers of smoking.
   Sullivan also said that while the Bush administration supports
the intent of legislation to increase regulation of tobacco
products and educate about the risks of smoking, it believes the
bill, which would cost an estimated $185 million, is unnecessary.
   The Tobacco Product Education and Health Protection Act of 1990
would establish a center as part of the federal Centers for Disease
Control to expand education efforts on smoking, conduct
smoking-related research and regulate tobacco products much as the
Food and Drug Administration regulates food products.
   The center also would administer a paid advertising program to
discourage smoking and provide incentive grants to states to
encourage enactment and better enforcement of laws prohibiting the
sale of tobacco to minors.
   Sullivan said his department yearly spends about $79 million on
anti-smoking programs, many of which duplicate the efforts proposed
in the legislaton.
   He said free public service announcements about the risks of
smoking are preferable to government-paid ads in light of other
demands on the federal budget. He also said that regulating the
additives in cigarettes, envisioned in the bill, would send the
wrong message.
   ``We're concerned that this would suggest that we believe that
under certain conditions, with certain monitoring, that tobacco is
safe,'' he said. ``We would rather see our efforts on reducing and
elmiminating by the year 2000 all tobacco from our society.''
   However, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. and chairman of the Senate
committee, noted that bottled Perrier water was pulled from the
market when it was found to contain benzene at levels up to four
times what is allowed under federal standards, while a surgeon
general's report estimated the benzene content of cigarettes is
2,000 times higher than that.
   ``The consumer has a right to know the key ingredients and
additives to a pack of cigarettes when they purchase the product,''
Kennedy said.
   Sullivan agreed that consumers should have such information.
   Charles O. Whitley, representing The Tobacco Institute, noted in
testimony submitted to the committee that Congress previously
considered and rejected disclosure of ingredient information
because it contains trade secrets. This information is supplied to
the health and human services secretary, but it does not identify
the company or brand of cigarettes.
   Whitley also said other provisions in the bill aren't needed
because young people are already aware of the risks of smoking. He
also denied that the industry targets young people in advertising
campaigns to encourage them to take up the habit.
   He also defended the industry against critics who say that
tobacco companies target women and minorities, saying the industry
is not trying to encourage people to start smoking but rather hopes
to retain or gain market share from competitors.
   Sullivan released a report on the economic consequences of
smoking that estimated smoking-related disease costs each American
$221 a year largely in health-care and insurance costs.
   He said the costs average $1 billion per state annually, but
range from a high of $5.8 billion in California to a low of $82
million in Alaska. The report's analysis, the first of its kind, is
based on 1985 statistics.
   Smoking causes an estimated 390,000 deaths in the United States
annually and about 29 percent of adults smoke, he said.
   Sullivan recently criticized R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for its
plans to market a cigarette targeted at blacks. Reynolds
subsequently dropped those plans, but now intends to test-market a
cigarette called Dakota. News accounts have said the company was
considering gearing the cigarette toward young women with a high
school education or less.
   Sullivan has been concerned about minorities because they have
higher rates of smoking than whites and have a higher rate of
smoking-related disease and death. Among high school seniors, the
smoking rate has leveled off at around 19 percent, he said, while
lung cancer has surpassed the incidence of breast cancer among
women.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Tuesday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.6 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.80 percent, up from 7.65 percent
last week. Another $7.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.77 percent, also up from 7.65 percent

   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.83
percent on Feb. 5, and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent on
Oct. 2, 1989.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.07 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,802.80 and 8.20 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,607.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.05
percent last week, down from 8.13 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. film ``Music Box,'' starring Jessica
Lange as an attorney who defends her father against charges of war
crimes, won a Golden Bear award Tuesday as the 40th Berlin film
festival came to a close.
   The Golden Bear is the top award at the prestigious festival.
   ``Music Box,'' directed by Costa-Gavras, shared its Golden Bear
with a 1969 Czech work titled ``Skylarks on the String.'' The
latter film, which criticizes the former communist state, was
banned by authorities there for 20 years.
   Another Golden Bear went as a special anniversary prize to
American director Oliver Stone for his film ``Born on the Fourth of
July,'' starring Tom Cruise as a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran who
becomes a champion of the anti-war movement.
   A short animated film from Italy called ``Mistertao'' won the
third and final Golden Bear awarded this year.
   The event, which ranks with the Cannes and Venice film festivals
as the most important in the world, was held for the first time in
East Berlin as well as West Berlin.
   The 12-day festival brought a shower of famous stars down on the
city, including Ms. Lange, Stone, Sally Field, Daryl Hannah and
Michael Douglas.
   Other U.S. entries included ``The War of the Roses'' with
Douglas and Kathleen Turner and ``Shadow Makers,'' starring Paul
Newman.
   All together 22 feature films and 16 short works were in the
running for the Bears.
   Seven Silver Bears were presented in various categories at the
end of the festival.
   One went to American actor Morgan Freeman and actress Jessica
Tandy for the best joint performance in Bruce Beresford's ``Driving
Miss Daisy.''
   Another was awarded to Michael Verhoeven as best director for
the West German entry ``The Nasty Girl.'' The film deals with the
rejection a young woman faces from her home town when she begins
investigating her neighbors' Nazi pasts.
   A film about homosexuals called ``Coming Out'' _ East Germany's
only entry _ won a Silver Bear for its ``sensitive handling of the
dilemma of minorities _ whatever kind,'' the jury said in a
statement.
   Four other Silver Bears went to entries from Great Britain, the
Soviet Union, China and Brazil.

   A House Ways and Means subcommittee announced
Tuesday that it will hold hearings into whether foreign companies'
U.S. subsidiaries are paying their fair share of taxes.
   Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee that
oversees the IRS, made the announcement during a hearing on efforts
by the Internal Revenue Service to increase collections of
delinquent taxes.
   ``The IRS does take this question seriously,'' IRS Commissioner
Fred T. Goldberg Jr. said when asked about the auditing of
subsidiaries of foreign corporations. He said he does not know
whether the audits include investigation of fraud by any subsidiary.
   The IRS confirmed Monday a New York Times story that it is
investigating whether numerous U.S. arms of foreign companies
underpaid billions of dollars in taxes in the 1980s.
   The IRS said more than half of 36,800 foreign-owned companies
that filed tax returns in 1986 reported no taxable income.
   Earlier, a report by the staff of the congressional Joint
Committee on Taxation concluded ``there is some indication that the
level of tax payments of foreign-owned businesses in the United
States is unusually low.''

<HEAD>Greenspan Is Guardedly Optimistic That Nation Can Avoid Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Tuesday expressed ``guarded optimism'' that the country can avoid a
recession this year, but his warnings on the dangers of
accelerating inflation helped send financial markets into a
tailspin.
   Setting up a potential clash with the administration, Greenspan
said the central bank was looking for the economy to grow at a rate
far below the one on which the administration based its 1991 budget.
   Wall Street, which has been battered this year by rising foreign
interest rates, took Greenspan's inflation warnings and growth
forecast as further evidence that the central bank is intent on
pursuing a tight money policy to battle inflation and thus will not
move anytime soon to lower interest rates.
   At mid-afternoon, interest rates on long-term government bonds
had jumped sharply while the prices, which move in the opposite
direction, fell as much as $18 per $1,000 in face value. The Dow
Jones industrial average of 30 stocks was down more than 38 points
at the close of business.
   ``We're in an area where (inflation) is in danger of
accelerating,'' Greenspan said in his appearance before a House
Banking subcommittee.
   He called the performance of inflation so far this year
``horrendous'' although he said the January's jump in prices was
attributable in large part to temporary factors stemming from
severe cold in December.
   But he said that the risks of higher inflation in the present
circumstances were ``larger than we should be willing to tolerate.''
   In the new Fed economic forecast, the central bank projected
that the economy, as measured by the gross national product, will
grow at an anemic rate of between 1.75 percent and 2 percent this
year, the slowest annual growth rate since the 1981-82 recession.
   The Bush administration, in a forecast released last month with
its 1991 budget request, forecast growth almost a full percentage
point higher at 2.6 percent, when measured from the fourth quarter
of 1989.
   The administration also predicted that interest rates would drop
sharply from their current levels, a decline that would lower the
government's borrowing costs on the $2.9 trillion national debt.
   With the Fed expected to keep interest rates high to restrain
inflationary pressures, economists said both the administration's
growth and interest rate assumptions would prove to be too
optimistic, thus ballooning the federal budget deficit by billions
of dollars.
   ``The Greenspan testimony is a clear indication of a toughened
central bank stance against inflation,'' said Alan Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co. ``The message is that interest rates
will stay high and perhaps go higher as the central bank keeps the
economy throttled back to bring down inflation.''
   From June through December, the central bank had been gradually
easing short-term interest rates out of concern that weakness in
the economy might spell the end of the seven-year-old economic
recovery, the longest in peacetime history.
   While economic growth did slow to a barely discernible 0.5
percent annual rate from October through December, the worst
performance in 3{ years, Greenspan in his testimony that he
believed the danger point for an imminent recession had now passed.
   He cited a variety of January statistics from rising auto sales
to a surge in new home construction to bolster his belief that a
modest rebound was occurring and that the ``weakest point may have
passed.''
   ``While we cannot be certain that we are as yet out of the
recessionary woods, such evidence warrants at least guarded
optimism,'' he said.
   The Fed's economic forecast for 1990 represented only a modest
change from a preliminary estimate of 1.5 percent to 2 percent GNP
growth made last June.
   But the central bank did significantly alter its forecast on
inflation, predicting consumer prices would rise 4 percent to 4.5
percent this year, down from a June forecast of a 4.5 percent to 5
percent increase.
   Analysts took this revision as another sign that the Fed was
toughening its inflation-fighting resolve.
   ``The ultimate objective of economic policy is to foster the
maximum sustainable rate of economic growth,'' Greenspan said,
adding, however, that the economy might have to undergo sub-par
growth for a period of time in order to make sure inflation
remained contained.
   On other topics:
   _Greenspan said that there was not ``at any time'' a desire on
the part of federal officials to rescue Drexel Burnham Lambert, the
large securities firm which got into financial difficulties because
of its aggressive marketing of junk bonds.
   _He expressed his belief that the current turmoil in junk bonds
would stabilize and that the sales of these high-yield, high-risk
securities would continue, although at a lower level.
   _The Fed, in its economic outlook, said that the near-term
prospects for a moderation in labor cost pressures were not
favorable and added that the recent declines in the value of the
dollar would also worsen inflation by boosting the price of
imported goods.

   Police in southeastern Nepal fired
Tuesday on pro-democracy protesters who tried to burn down a police
station, killing at least three demonstrators, the government said.
   Also Tuesday, youths battled riot police on the streets of
Bhaktapur, seven miles east of the capital. There were no reports
of deaths or injuries in that protest.
   A Home Ministry statement said a man wounded Monday when police
fired into a crowd in Bhaktapur died Tuesday. That brought to 11
the number of people killed since Sunday, the first day of
nationwide demonstrations against a 29-year-old ban on political
parties.
   Witnesses said at least two more people have been killed in the
clashes.
   According to the government, police have arrested 175 people
throughout Nepal in recent weeks. Opposition sources put the number
at more than 400 in Katmandu alone.
   Nepal's estimated 2,000 lawyers went on a one-day strike Tuesday
to protest the detention of suspected supporters of the campaign,
said Basu Deb Dhungana, president of the Nepal Bar Association.
   ``We are always for the rule of the law and human rights,''
Dhungana said.
   Also in the capital, riot police were deployed near the Bir
Hospital, where the victims of Monday's protests were taken. Many
people gathered outside the gates of the hospital, but there were
no demonstrations.
   Tuesday's deaths occurred in Jadukuha, 100 miles southeast of
Katmandu, when police fired on a mob trying to burn down a police
station, the government said in a statement.
   A protester and three policemen also were injured in the
violence, it said.
   Police fired in self-defense after a baton charge and tear gas
failed to disperse the crowd, the statement said. No further
details were given.
   In Bhaktapur Tuesday, young men hurled stones at police in riot
gear who occasionally charged the crowds but mostly kept their
distance.
   ``You dogs!'' yelled one man aiming a slingshot at
steel-helmeted policemen, ``you killed our people.''
   The policemen, wearing chest pads and shin guards over brown
uniforms, took shelter behind pillars of the 17th century temples
that dot the town.
   When police charged with batons, the rioters scampered into the
narrow, stone-paved alleys of the town's main marketplace. In the
two-story red brick houses along the alleys, women and children
huddled behind half-open windows.
   ``This fight will continue,'' said a demonstrator who ran into
an alley after hurling stones at officers.
   Police said they had orders not to use force and were content to
keep the demonstrators at bay. ``Yesterday (Monday) we were on the
offensive, today we are on the defensive,'' one officer said on
condition of anonymity.
   At least four people were killed and fifteen injured Monday in
Bhaktapur when police fired on demonstrators. That number included
the protester who died Tuesday.
   Four people were killed Sunday in clashes between police and
demonstrators elsewhere in Nepal, the Himalayan kingdom nestled
between India, China and Tibet.
   Under the present constitution, the king is head of state. He
commands wide influence in the country's 140-member National
Assembly, which is headed by a prime minister.
   The assembly's 112 elected members, chosen through national
balloting, cannot claim affiliation to any political party. Another
28 members are nominated by the king.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with democracy ended in 1960, when
King Mahendra, the father of the present monarch, Birendra,
dissolved the government and banned all political parties, accusing
them of misusing power.
   The government says the campaign for democracy, sponsored by the
Nepali Congress and the United Left Front, runs counter to a
national referendum held in 1980, when the apolitical system was
retained by a slight majority.
   The government also accuses the parties of trying to impose
their version of democracy on Nepal.
   Nepal, a landlocked country of about 17 million people, is one
of the poorest in the world, with an annual per capita income of
$160.

<TEXT>
   With German reunification speeding Western
Europe's drive to create a 12-nation single market by 1992,
President Bush's trade policies were attacked sharply Tuesday by
both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
   ``We're going to be dealt out of the deal,'' Rep. Sam Gejdenson,
D-Conn., told top trade officials in the State and Commerce
Departments and the White House Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative.
   Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., complained that Bush ``is still living
in the 1950s and '60s when we had free trade'' while the European
Community is about to join Japan in erecting barriers to U.S.
exports through its EC '92 directives.
   Gejdenson, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's
trade subcommittee, said adminstration officials assured him a year
ago told that Europe '92 ``is going to be the best thing since
sliced bread.''
   But in the past nine months, he said, General Electric and
United Technologies have decided to move some of their jet engine
facilities to Europe to assure continued market access there.
   For the same reason, several semiconductor manufacturers have
reversed their initial plans to build new plants here and are
instead going to put them in Europe, he said.
   ``Companies in this country have decided that you're not going
to get the job done, so they're moving their investments to
Europe,'' he asserted.
   Administration officials cited statistics at a hearing before
Gejdenson's subcommittee showing that for the first time in five
years, the United States in 1989 enjoyed a trade surplus with
Europe _ a slight $1.7 billion.
   While claiming success in knocking down proposed barriers for
keeping U.S. trucking companies and banks out of a unified European
market, they admitted losing key rounds on broadcasting and
agriculture products.
   ``We were not successful in the EC broadcast directive,'' said
Peter Allgeier, the assistant U.S. trade representative for Europe.
``But we have not left the playing field on that one, let me assure
you.''
   Gejdenson complained that the administation hasn't even taken
the field yet, citing a congressional directive last May to augment
the U.S. delegation monitoring the negotiations in Brussels with
three career Foreign Service officers from the Commerce Department.
   Administration officials said two of those positions should be
filled by this summer.
   ``Our single biggest trading partner is changing all the rules
of the game'' and this is being treated as ``something we can get
around to in the lazy days of summer,'' Gejdenson snapped.
   ``It just boggles the mind,'' he said. ``This isn't a simply a
debate about between liberalization and protectionism. It's about
the survival of American manufacturing and European dominance over
us economically.''
   Assistant Secretary of State Eugene McAllister said moves in the
past week toward reunifying East and West Germany ``could very well
help speed up'' the adoption of a single-market economy for all of
Western Europe.
   ``Many of the EC nations are intent upon keeping Germany
Western-oriented and they see EC '92 as a very important
contributing factor to that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration Increases Borrowing for Thrift Bailout Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, under pressure to
speed up its savings and loan cleanup, said Tuesday it will borrow
$11 billion by the end of March for its thrift bailout agency.
   The new money should start flowing to the Resolution Trust Corp.
by the end of this month, said William Taylor, the chief staff
officer of a Treasury-led board overseeing the agency.
   Without the money, the RTC would face a cash crunch that would
virtually halt the disposal of failed thrifts after this week,
according to RTC spokesman Stephen J. Katsanos.
   Bailout legislation enacted in August provides $50 billion
through next year to cover the losses of failed thrifts. But the
trust corporation needs to borrow as much as an additional $100
billion in ``working capital.''
   The $11 billion is the first leg of the borrowing, which is to
be repaid as the government sells loans, real estate and other
assets inherited from the failed thrifts.
   The agency hasn't announced its borrowing plans for subsequent
quarters, but Taylor said the amount in the April-June period
``could be more'' than $11 billion.
   Tuesday's announcment follows a ruling last week by the Justice
Department, which found the RTC a government agency eligible to
borrow through the Treasury. Although the trust corporation is
overseen by a Treasury-led panel, its work is performed by an
independent banking agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Members of Congress and private analysts have harshly criticized
the arrangement as bureaucratic and prone to delays. However, the
establishment of the new borrowing plan likely will shift the brunt
of pressure from the administration's oversight board to the FDIC.
   ``We're going to try to stay out of their way as much as
possible,'' Taylor told reporters.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, a member of the
oversight panel, told a House Banking subcommittee Tuesday he
expected ``a significant acceleration of activity.''
   At the end of last week, the RTC had disposed of only 49 of the
368 failed thrifts it has seized. The agency has made little
headway in selling the $180 billion in assets owned by the S&amp;Ls.
   It is projecting an increase in resolutions to 50 institutions
per quarter, approximately double the pace of its first six months
of operation.

<HEAD>Pentagon Report Rips Management of Military Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon report released Tuesday said that
the Air Force colonel who resigned last week as editor of the
Pacific Stars and Stripes newspaper violated military regulations
by manipulating the paper's news content.
   Col. Edwin J. Montgomery resigned Friday, citing the report by
ombudsman Philip Foisie.
   Foisie was hired by the Defense Department last year to assess
the free flow of information to the military readership of the
Toyko-based Pacific Stars and Stripes and its European sister
publication based near Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Montgomery had said he was disappointed that Foisie viewed his
editing practices as ``news management'' but was pleased he had not
been accused of censorship.
   In his report, Foisie said that the editing process at Pacific
Stars and Stripes under Montgomery was ``seriously flawed'' but
that there was no censorship in the sense of readers being
systematically deprived of any specific type of news.
   ``In my professional judgment, Col. Montgomery has too often
infringed on the common practice of good journalism,'' Foisie
wrote. ``If `censorship' is the wrong word, `news management' is
probably the right description of these infringements, and it is
expressly prohibited ... in the military regulations. ...''
   Civilian journalists at Pacific Stars and Stripes have publicly
complained of censorship by military editors, news management and
harassment of journalists who raise objections.
   Foisie said Montgomery, who assumed the role of commander and
editor-in-chief of the newspaper in 1986, was ``seriously miscast''
due to a lack of journalistic experience and had failed to delegate
many editing duties.
   Foise credited Montgomery with improving the newspaper's
financial position and said some of Montgomery's critics on the
paper had exaggerated the ``news management'' problem by claiming
he frequently killed stories unfavorable to the military.
   But Foisie said Montgomery was preoccupied with the details of
editorial content and had introduced what many staff journalists
consider ``an ideological element'' in deciding which stories were
printed and how they were displayed in the paper.
   This, Foisie, wrote, ``has had a chilling effect on the staff
and has induced a degree of self-censorship.''
   Foisie said the Tokyo newsroom had fallen into disarray and was
plagued by ``very low morale, an incipient staff revolt and one
might say a staff conspiracy.''
   Reiterating a recommendation he made in a preliminary report
last month, Foisie said the newspaper should put a civilian in the
post of top news executive. That would make the paper less
vulnerable to charges that the military censors it, he said.
   The Stars and Stripes papers are ``authorized but unofficial
publications,'' the Pentagon says. Their charter says they are to
provide ``a free flow of news and information ... without
censorship or news management.''

<HEAD>Income Prospects Bright, but Still Under Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for farm income continue bright,
although there is some slippage from the record level of two years
ago, an Agriculture Department report said Tuesday.
   Net cash income may be in the range of $52 billion to $57
billion, compared with an estimated $53 billion in 1989 and the
record of $57.2 billion in 1988.
   That is the money left for farmers after deducting cash expenses
from gross cash income in a calendar year. It can include proceeds
from sales of commodities held over from previous years.
   Net farm income, another method of bookkeeping, may be in the
range of $44 billion to $49 billion this year, compared with $48
billion in 1989 and $42.7 billion in 1988.
   This method measures income from farming during a specific year,
including changes in the value of inventories, allowances for
family dwellings and depreciation.
   Figures for both accounting methods were unchanged from
projections made by the department's Economic Research Service the
last two months.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter noted in testimony before
the House Agriculture Committee earlier Tuesday that ``virtually
all indicators of farm sector well-being have improved'' the last
few years.
   ``Farm income is up, farm failures are down, farmland values are
recovering and debt-to-asset ratios have improved,'' Yeutter said.
``Commodity surpluses have all but disappeared, some idle land has
returned to production, and farm program spending is down.''
   The agency report said farmland values have been revised, based
on the 1987 census of agriculture. The average U.S. price of
farmland as of February 1989, for example, was revised upward to
$667 per acre from the earlier estimate of $597. No state figures
were included.

<HEAD>Black Leaders Call for New Trial in Civil Rights Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black leaders have renewed demands for new
charges against a former fertilizer salesman who was tried and
freed in the slaying of civil rights activist Medgar Evers 26 years
ago.
   The Rev. L.D. Bass, a longtime civil rights leader in Jackson,
contended Monday at a rally that prosecutors are not adequately
pursuing a new trial against Byron De La Beckwith.
   ``We're not going to rest until Byron De La Beckwith is brought
to justice in Mississippi,'' Bass told about a dozen people
gathered for the protest in front of the Hinds County Courthouse.
   Murder charges against Beckwith, a white supremacist, were
dropped after two all-white Hinds County juries were unable to
reach verdicts in 1964.
   Prosecutors said Monday they are continuing to determine whether
sufficient evidence exists to reopen the case.
   Evers, 37, who was a field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP,
was killed June 12, 1963, by a bullet in the back as he emerged
from his car at his Jackson home.
   Beckwith's rifle, bearing one of his fingerprints, was found
near Evers' home. Beckwith contended the rifle had been stolen from
him.
   The rifle and all other evidence from the two trials disappeared
several months ago, presumably from the Hinds County circuit
clerk's office where such documents and property were supposed to
be kept.
   ``We are just as interested as anyone else in bringing the
killer of Medgar Evers to justice, but it takes evidence to do
that. Right now, we just don't have that evidence,'' Assistant
District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter said Monday.
   Beckwith, 69, lives in Signal Mountain, Tenn.
   Last year, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People and Jackson City Council asked for the case to be
reopened after reports that the state's old segregation spy agency,
the Sovereignty Commission, screened potential jurors before
Beckwith's second trial.
   Prosecutors investigated and said they found no evidence of jury
tampering.
   The local offices of the FBI, state Department of Archives and
History and the Jackson Police Department failed to turn up the
missing evidence, DeLaughter said.
   A search also was made of the FBI's Washington office, but
DeLaughter had no word on the results.
   ``They have swept it (the case) under the rug and they're not
even moving at a snail's pace,'' Bass said. ``We want the district
attorney to come forward and bring this case to justice.''
   Aaron Henry, president of the state NAACP who also attended the
rally, questioned the sincerity of the hunt for the missing
evidence.
   ``Keep on looking because whenever we don't want to do
something, we find reasons not to do it,'' he said.
   Beckwith said by telephone Monday that he might return to
Mississippi some day to seek political office. He ran
unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in Mississippi in 1967.
   ``If things get much worse in Mississippi, I plan to run for
lieutenant governor so that people will know men and women of white
Christian lineage will not put up with this deviltry,'' Beckwith
said.

<HEAD>One Killed in Kosovo; Army to Maintain Order</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An ethnic Albanian demonstrator was
reported killed Tuesday in Kosovo, and the federal government
decided to give the army a direct role in maintaining order in the
restive southern province.
   State television said the demonstrator was killed in Titova
Mitrovica, 28 miles northwest of Pristina, the provincial capital.
It gave no details of the death, but reported ``numerous injuries
among demonstrators and the police.''
   Twenty-eight ethnic Albanians have been reported killed since
January in Kosovo, an impoverished province of 1.9 million people
where ethnic Albanians outnumber Slavs 9 to 1.
   According to official figures, the same number of people were
killed a year ago after Serbia made constitutional changes that
gave it near-total control. Until then, Kosovo had been an
autonomous province within Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics.
   In an emergency meeting, the eight-member national presidency
decided for the first time to involve the army, which has been
deployed in Kosovo since last year, in quelling the unrest.
   A statement from the presidency carried by the official news
agency Tanjug said it ``has decided to partially engage units of
the Yugoslav Peoples' Army in Kosovo with the aim of protecting
constitutional order and preventing violence.''
   It said the ``security situation in Kosovo has seriously
deteriorated'' because of the unrest, ``which could have tragic
consequences for all citizens in this province and for the country
as a whole.''
   Parts of Kosovo have been under virtual martial law,
particularly during the last month of renewed unrest.
   Serbs in Kosovo said Tuesday they would take up arms to protect
themselves if the central government did not act. Serbs claim
harassment by the majority in Kosovo, which is adjacent to Albania.
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians conducted strikes and stayed away
from school Tuesday to protest the state of emergency in the
region. Several thousand also demonstrated in Pristina and other
towns, in some cases fighting with police.
   About 10,000 Serbs rallied in Kosovo Polje, a suburb of
Pristina, to demand firm police action against ethnic Albanians
demonstrating for more autonomy and democracy.
   The Serbs said in a statement they would ``take up arms'' if
police did not arrest ``the ringleaders of Albanian separatism and
terrorism.''
   Serbian leaders in Kosovo have rejected dialogue with opposition
movements, insisting that several prominent ethnic Albanian
intellectuals who helped establish the groups are ``hostile
elements'' who should be jailed.
   About 4,000 ethnic Albanian university students marched through
Pristina chanting ``Democracy! Democracy!''
   Tanjug said they urged ethnic Albanians to end street protests
``because they are being used'' by authorities ``as an excuse for
the continued bloodshed, violence and repression.''
   International human rights organizations and officials of the
liberal Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia have accused
Serbian authorities of violating human rights in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday notified Congress
that the governments of the United States and Canada had reached
agreement on the quick lifting of tariffs on some 400 products
worth $6 billion in trade.
   For the products covered, the agreement speeds up the timetable
for lifting duties under the landmark U.S.-Canada free-trade
agreement that took effect Jan. 1, 1989. That pact calls for
phasing out all tariffs by 1999.
   U.S. products on which duties will be eliminated at once under
the speeded-up agreement include chemicals, pharmaceutical
products, photographic film, telecommunications equipment, electric
motors and generators, hydraulic pumps, printed circuits and
scientific instruments.
   Canadian products that will benefit include diesel engines,
chemical plastics, machinery, textiles and certain food products.
   Two-way trade in goods and services between the United States
and Canada is roughly $200 billion. About 70 percent is currently
duty free.
   However, many products _ notably Canadian steel, lumber, paper
and other forest products _ remain under tariffs that are being
phased out under terms of the original free-trade agreement. These
were not affected by Tuesday's action.

<HEAD>King Says Toll-Free Phone Network a Success Despite Busy Signals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King on
Tuesday defended the agency's nationwide toll-free telephone
network as a ``success story,'' but acknowledged that callers too
often get busy signals.
   Mrs. King said the agency was preparing television and newspaper
public service announcements encouraging people to ``have breakfast
with Social Security'' by calling between 7 and 9 a.m. when lines
are less busy.
   The telephone network, which went nationwide in October, was
expected to handle about 250,000 calls a day, but more than 1.5
million people try to get through on peak days, and many call
between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., she said.
   ``The 800 number is the biggest success story we've had,'' Mrs.
King said at a media briefing. ``We just have too a big a success
on our hands ... the trick is how to manage it so that it works
better.''
   The telephone network _ reached by dialing 1-800-2345-SSA _ is
staffed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. local time across the country, and
allows callers to take care of many matters without going into a
Social Security office.
   However, congressional critics have complained that people often
are unable to get through on the toll-free lines and that many
don't get full and accurate information when they do get through. A
House Ways and Means subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing
Wednesday on the network.
   Mrs. King said a study by the Inspector General's Office of the
Department of Health and Human Services found that 67 percent of
those who used the toll-free line said they would use the telephone
again to do business with Social Security, up from 53 percent in
1984.
   Eighty-two percent of those who contacted Social Security using
the 800 number reported the service was good or very good, she said.
   ``What we are finding is that when people do get through, they
find the service is courteous, they're very happy with the
information they received,'' she said.
   In January, traditionally a busy month for the agency, an
estimated 52 percent of calls to the toll-free number were met with
busy signals, compared with 14 percent in December, 51 percent in
November and 30 percent in October, Mrs. King said. Her goal is to
reduce the busy rate on peak days to 35 percent by the end of the
year.
   Mrs. King also announced three steps to improve morale and
service at the Social Security Administration, where many workers
have complained that they are overworked and unable to provide good
service because of huge staff cuts during the Reagan administration.
   Mrs. King said she is:
   _Dispatching four ``strike teams'' to visit field offices
throughout the country and approve additional employees and
equipment where needs are the greatest. About 400 employees could
be added, she said.
   _Suspending all numerical performance goals, such as handling a
certain number of cases per day or per month. Mrs. King said the
agency would come up with a new set of goals to better measure
workloads and performance.
   _Naming Bill Rogers, a former Social Security employee from the
Seattle area, as ombudsman to hear complaints and ideas from Social
Security managers and employees.

   The Senate on Tuesday unanimously ratified an
International Labor Organization convention agreement aimed at
improving the collection and reporting of labor statistics around
the world.
   The ILO Convention on Labor Statistics was approved 94-0, nearly
five years after it was approved by the U.N.-affiliated labor
organization in Geneva, Switzerland.
   President Reagan transmitted the treaty to the Senate on Jan. 3,
1989, less than three weeks before he left office. Reagan
recommended its ratification at the time, as did Secretary of State
George P. Shultz and Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin.
   The Reagan Cabinet officers noted that the United States already
was collecting and reporting basic labor force, employment and
economic statistics of the kind the ILO was seeking in its
convention on statistics. But these officials said that since the
United States could readily abide by the terms of the treaty, there
was no reason not to ratify it.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., told colleagues Tuesday
that the labor statistics treaty afforded the Senate a good
opportunity to go on record in supporting the work of the ILO.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday the ``most critical challenge'' facing the United States in
combatting illegal drug use is the problem of domestic consumption
rather blocking supplies from abroad.
   ``As long as the demand for drugs by Americans remains
voracious, our nation faces an endless, uphill struggle to halt
supply,'' Baker said.
   His remarks were prepared for delivery in New York at the U.N.
Special Session on Narcotics. A text of his remarks was released by
the State Department.
   Baker expressed hope that a U.N.-led effort to act against drug
smuggling will help the world come closer to ending the drug
scourge.
   He added that to be successful any such program must entail
concrete commitments and be fully implemented by U.N. agencies.
   ``Certainly, we the member governments cannot ask the United
Nations to do things that we will not do at home,'' he said.
   Baker's appearance at the U.N. session, just five days after the
drug summit in Colombia, was aimed at reinforcing the high priority
the Bush administration is attaching to the drug issue.
   He said the domestic anti-drug budget has increased to $7.6
billion, a 67 percent increase while, internationally, the increase
has been 73 percent, to $3.1 billion.
   ``We fully realize that attacking the problem of domestic
consumption is our most critical challenge,'' Baker said,
indicating he is sympathetic to Latin appeals that the
administration shift its emphasis to combatting drug abuse on the
home front instead of the supply source.
   He added, however, that U.S. drug-control strategy calls for an
attack on the drug problem in all its aspects _ consumption,
trafficking, illicit production, treatment and rehabilitation.

   An explosion at an experimental factory for the
production of pure hydrogen in the Ukrainian city of Rovno killed
two people and injured three, the state news agency Tass reported
Tuesday.
   An engineer ordered the evacuation of the plant on Monday after
discovering a leak in the pumping station, but the explosion
occurred before all the workers could get out, the agency said.
   The plant was destroyed. Tass, citing experts, said the blast
caused no environmental pollution in Rovno, 600 miles southwest of
Moscow. It said the accident was under investigation.

<HEAD>Top Congressional Democrats Considering Income Tax Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley offered praise
on Tuesday to a proposal to allow people to partially offset the
costs of the Social Security payroll tax by taking a credit on
their income tax returns.
   The plan is one of several options under study by a task force
of top House and Senate Democrats weighing what to do about the
vast surpluses accumulated each year by the Social Security trust
funds. The issue has attracted attention in recent weeks after Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., proposed reducing the surpluses by
cutting the payroll tax.
   The Democratic leaders are considering a list of proposals
compiled by aides. The lawmakers are expected to recommend a course
of action as early as this week.
   Foley, D-Wash., called the income tax credit idea ``a very
interesting proposal'' in his daily briefing with reporters, but
provided no details.
   ``It would I think tend to restore some progressivity to the tax
system, and it has other features I think are worthy of very
serious consideration,'' Foley said.
   Workers pay a 7.65 percent Social Security payroll tax, an
amount that is in addition to their income tax. Employers must also
pay the government an equal amount on behalf of each employee.
   Critics have charged that the payroll tax discriminates against
low- and middle-income workers because it is levied only on the
first $51,300 of annual earnings. People pay no payroll tax on
their wages above that amount, and pay no payroll tax at all on
income from interest, dividends, rents and other non-wage earnings.
   Sources speaking on condition they not be identified said there
are several formulations of the income-tax credit plan. No final
decisions have been made on the credit's amount, who would qualify,
or when it would begin.
   What it would accomplish, supporters say, is sidestep the
criticism the Bush administration and other Republicans have
leveled at Moynihan's proposed tax cut: that it tinkers with Social
Security, a highly sensitive political issue for Congress. White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has said Moynihan's idea will
eventually lead to offsetting tax increases or cuts in Social
Security benefits.
   ``Its one great source of appeal obviously is you don't have to
do anything about the Social Security trust fund,'' said one source.
   Moynihan's plan would cut the government's payroll tax
collections by $62 billion over the next two years, a sizable
addition to what is already an expected $138 billion budget deficit
for this year. It has been criticized by Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.; the American Association of
Retired Persons and the National Association of Manufacturers.
   But the plan is believed to have the support of many members of
Congress because it would cut taxes.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said
Tuesday that there is ``a large, fluid body'' of senators undecided
about Moynihan's bill, and predicted there ``could be a stampede if
favor of the Moynihan proposal'' should there be a vote on it.
   The Social Security task force consists of Bentsen,
Rostenkowski, Sasser, Senate Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   This year, the Social Security trust fund is expected to have a
$66 billion surplus. Moynihan and others say those collections make
the federal deficit appear smaller that it really is.

   Former members of the Panamanian Defense
Forces are among 15 people in custody in Panama in connection with
the murders of an American citizen and a U.S. Embassy employee, the
FBI said Tuesday.
   Those in custody include both potential witnesses and ``possible
participants'' in the killings of Raymond Dragseth, an American
living in Panama City and Fernando E. Brathwaite, a U.S. Embassy
employee, the FBI said.
   Panamanian authorities are expected to bring formal charges in
the near future, FBI officials said.
   The bodies of both men were found Dec. 21, the day after U.S.
troops invaded Panama.
   The FBI said its investigation determined that members of the
PDF abducted Dragseth from his house at gunpoint on Dec. 20.
Brathwaite was abducted later in the day.
   Both men were taken outside the city and shot to death, the FBI
said.
   The former PDF members in custody were members of a special
anti-terrorism unit of the Panamaniam military under the government
of deposed leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, said a law enforcement
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The investigation was conducted by the FBI along with the
Panamanian Technical Judicial Police and the U.S. Embassy.

<HEAD>U.S. Defends Shortwave Station in Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Tuesday defended
construction of a $300 million shortwave relay station in Israel,
with one official saying ``tremendous attention'' was given to
ensure the project doesn't hurt the environment.
   Malcolm Forbes Jr., chairman of the Board of International
Broadcasting, told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that more
than $2 million had been spent on environmental studies.
   ``Please know that the BIB shares these concerns and has given
them tremendous attention throughout the design phase of the
project,'' Forbes said. ``There have been no significant findings
whatsoever that this station will have a detrimental effect on the
environment in the Negev.''
   Environmentalists have raised concerns that the project in the
Negev desert 30 miles south of the Dead Sea near the border of
Jordan could damage the ecology, particularly the path of migrating
birds.
   The project, conceived three years ago, will consist of 16,
500-kilowatt transmitters and 37 curtain antennas. The transmitters
will be used by the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe-Radio
Liberty, government-funded stations.
   The Board of International Broadcasting is the parent of Radio
Free Europe-Radio Liberty.
   The transmitters will give the stations added power to reach
Asian regions of the Soviet Union, as well as listeners in Africa,
India and Pakistan.
   Despite Forbes' assurances, environmentalists and Rep. James
Scheuer, D-N.Y., continued to oppose the project.
   ``It's quite time for the project to be reappraised,'' Scheuer
said, adding it would be more suitable to put the station in Asia.
   Scheuer also argued that events in Eastern Europe, where
democracy is emerging, have lessened the need for the station in
Israel. U.S. officials disagreed.
   The ``situation in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria _ both intended
audiences for this relay station _ remains fragile,'' the BIB said
in a statement.
   Brent Blackwelder, vice president of Friends of the Earth, an
environmental group, said the project should be rescinded and the
money channeled elsewhere.
   Because the station is a complex project of towers, cables and
guy wires, it will ``present a major visual impact in this desert
area and will have the potential to impact in this desert and will
have the potential to impact the very significant (bird) flyway
connecting Africa to Europe and Asia,'' Blackwelder said.

<TEXT>
   A 92-year-old woman's legal fight to save
her home and life savings ended in victory Tuesday with a court
settlement that lets her keep both.
   The settlement, reached on the first day of a negligence trial,
effectively overturned a 1987 jury verdict that penalized Luella
Wilson for loaning her great-nephew the money to buy a car that he
drove off a bridge.
   Under the verdict, Wilson stood to lose her home in North
Bennington and her savings of about $950,000.
   But shortly after noon Tuesday, Wilson received a telephone call
from her lawyer. ``You've won, Luella. You can keep your land and
we have won the case,'' he was quoted as saying.
   None of the parties to the case would disclose details of the
settlement. Sitting at her kitchen table, drinking a shot of
whiskey, Wilson said she was happy to win.
   ``I don't feel very damned good. I can't walk, but I did win,''
she said.
   The case grew out of Wilson's decision in 1984 to loan Willard
Stuart the money to buy a car, despite his poor driving record and
lack of a driver's license.
   Shortly after that, Stuart drove the car off a bridge after
drinking beer and whiskey and smoking marijuana with a group of
young men. One of his companions, Mark Vince, was in the back seat
during the accident and was seriously injured. He later had one leg
amputated.
   Vince sued Wilson. A 1987 jury found her liable and ordered her
to pay Vince $950,000, which amount to all of her assets.
   While refusing to reverse the 1987 decision on appeal, the
Vermont Supreme Court later ruled that a jury should decide if Ace
Auto of Bennington and its president and salesman in the deal, Gary
Gardner, should share the liability for selling the car to Stuart.
   In opening arguments at the trial Tuesday morning, Wilson's
lawyer, Frederick Harlow, told jurors that Vince, not Wilson, must
bear the blame for the fact he is mostly paralyzed and has lost a
leg.
   That theme was echoed by J. Fred Carbine, the lawyer for the car
dealership that sold Stuart the car.
   ``I say use your common sense,'' he told jurors. ``This was a
bad day for Mark Vince, a day that ruined his life, but we didn't
do it.''

   The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that parents
suspected of child abuse sometimes may be jailed indefinitely for
refusing to disclose the whereabouts of their children.
   Voting 7-2, the justices permitted the indefinite jailing of a
Maryland woman for refusing to tell authorities where her young son
can be found. Th boy is feared dead.
   Society's interest in protecting the boy from harm prevails over
the mother's claim that her right against self-incrimination will
be violated if she is forced to reveal the child's location, the
court said.
   Although narrowly written, the ruling could provide a new weapon
for officials seeking to protect children from parental abuse.
   In other action, the court:
   _Made it easier for disabled children to win some federal
welfare benefits. The 7-2 decision in a Pennsylvania case could
force the government to re-evaluate benefits for some 250,000
children.
   _Agreed to use an Ohio case to decide whether prosecutors who
exclude blacks as jurors because of their race violate the rights
of white defendants.
   _Left intact Baltimore, Md., ordinances requiring the city's
employee pension plans to divest themselves of all investments in
companies doing business with South Africa.
   _Rejected an appeal by Nevada officials, letting the federal
government withhold highway money from states that do not comply
with a national speed limit.
   _Refused to revive a lawsuit against the federal government and
a NASA engineer by the widow of one of the astronauts who died when
the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986.
   _In a case involving the private papers of Church of Scientology
founder L. Ron Hubbard, left intact a ruling that limits
dramatically the right of authors to quote unpublished material.
   _Rejected an appeal by Colorado officials seeking proceeds of
drug transactions that were forfeited to the federal government.
   In the case of the jailed Maryland mother, Jacqueline Bouknight
has been behind bars since April 1988 for refusing to disclose the
whereabouts of her son, Maurice. The boy has been missing since
September 1987, when he was 11 months old.
   Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore hospital in early 1987, when
he was 3 months old, for treatment of a broken leg and other
injuries. He temporarily was held in protective care.
   Maurice was returned to his mother's custody, after she agreed
not to punish him physically and to undergo training in parenting
skills.
   Nine months later, social workers said Ms. Bouknight no longer
was cooperating with them. The mother was held in contempt by a
judge after she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled
that jailing Ms. Bouknight for refusing to disclose the information
violates her constitutional protection against self-incrimination.
That ruling was overturned Tuesday.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court that Ms.
Bouknight's claim that her constitutional rights are being violated
is particularly weak because of her agreement with welfare
officials.
   Moreover, O'Connor said, in most missing-children cases
officials are trying to help the children and not prosecute parents.
   ``Concern for the child's safety,'' O'Connor said, ``underlay
the efforts to gain access to and then compel production of''
Bouknight's son.
   ``The government demands production of the very public charge
entrusted to a custodian and makes the demand for compelling
reasons unrelated to criminal law enforcement and as part of a
broadly applied regulatory regime,'' she said. ``In these
circumstances, Bouknight cannot invoke the privilege (against
self-incrimination) to resist the order to produce Maurice.''
   O'Connor noted that the mother never said she was unable to
produce the child because she did not know where he is.
   O'Connor also hinted that prosecutors might be barred from using
any testimony Bouknight gives in producing the child.
   But Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said
that is little comfort now for the mother.
   Accusing the court of ``riding roughshod'' over individual
rights, Marshall said, ``I am not content to deny Bouknight the
constitutional protection required ... now in the hope that she
will not be convicted later on the basis of her own testimony.''
   Marshall was joined in dissent by Justice William J. Brennan.
   Benna Ruth Solomon, chief counsel for the State and Local Legal
Center, said the decision gives significant help to welfare
officials.
   ``We're happy to have won this case,'' she said. ``I suppose it
would have been more helpful to child-protection people in the
field to have gotten more guidance, but I see no reason to be
pessimistic.''
   Some have compared the Bouknight case to that of Dr. Elizabeth
Morgan of Washington, D.C., released from jail last September after
more than two years behind bars for refusing to let her daughter
visit the girl's father, Morgan's former husband.
   Morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl for
court-ordered visits with the father. Morgan accused her former
husband of sexually abusing the child, charges he repeatedly has
denied.
   The right against self-incrimination was not an issue in that
case, so the Bouknight ruling appears to have no bearing on it.

<HEAD>Arens To Meet Baker, Split in Likud Emerges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens will meet with
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III this week to discuss the
stalled Middle East peace process, the Foreign Ministry announced
Tuesday.
   A potentially damaging split, meanwhile, emerged in Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc following the resignation of
the hard-line trade minister, Ariel Sharon.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said Arens will stop in Washington
for two days following a visit to Mexico and will meet Baker Friday.
   The visit ``is in the framework of continuing contacts to
advance the peace process,'' the statement said. It gave no further
details.
   Baker has proposed a three-way meeting with the foreign
ministers of Egypt and Israel to discuss the peace process and
resolve differences over the composition of a Palestinian
delegation for proposed Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   The three-way meeting would be aimed at reviving an Israeli
proposal for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as
a first step toward peace.
   The Israeli plan offers limited autonomy to the 1.7 million
Palestinian residents of the territories, captured by Israel from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. But it stops short of
meeting Palestinian demands for an independent state and for talks
with the PLO. Israel considers the PLO to be a terrorist
organization.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has been under fire by rebel
ministers within his own party who fear the U.S.-sponsored talks
could provide a back-door entry for the PLO and could lead to an
Israeli surrender of occupied lands, including Arab east Jerusalem.
   Last week, hard-line Trade Minister Ariel Sharon announced he
was resigning from the Cabinet and challenged Shamir's leadership
of Likud. The resignation was effective Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, five of Sharon's allies threatened to pull out of
Likud _ which would make the rival Labor Party the largest in
Parliament. However, it was not clear if the rebels' threat was
serious or they were only playing for more power within Likud.
   Sharon told reporters he had not sanctioned the split, but
added: ``All these things, to my regret, are because of one thing,
an absence of leadership'' in Likud.
   In a surprising display of strength, Shamir appointed three of
his allies to replace Sharon at the Trade Ministry and on the
decision-making Inner Cabinet, and to fill a vacancy in the full
Cabinet.
   He appointed Moshe Nissim, a member of the former Liberal Party,
as trade minister. He also appointed long-time ally Moshe Katzav to
Sharon's position in the 12-member Inner Cabinet and legislator
David Magen to the Cabinet.
   The appointments must now be approved by Parliament, where they
are expected to face little opposition, Israel radio said.
   The rebel legislators, headed by Economic Affairs Minister
Yitzhak Modai, submitted a letter on Monday to Parliament,
demanding recognition as an independent faction.
   Their letter, made public by newspapers Tuesday, said the group
would ``cease to be part of the Likud faction in Parliament'' if
the Knesset House Committee granted their request.
   A decision on whether to recognize the separate faction was
expected next Monday, Israel radio said.
   Such a move would reduce Likud to 35 seats in the 120-member
Knesset, or Parliament, compared to 39 for the center-left Labor
Party. The five rebels all are members of the Liberal Party, which
earlier merged with Likud.
   One of the rebels, legislator Pinchas Goldstein, noted on Israel
radio that the break with Likud was not final, but refused to
specify what their demands were.
   The radio said a Likud split could convince Labor to leave the
coalition Cabinet and try to form its own government with small
parties should Likud-Labor disagreements on the peace process come
to a head.
   Labor favors accepting the U.S.-proposed compromises to revive
Israel's stalled plan for holding Palestinian elections. Shamir has
publicly opposed most of the suggested compromises.

<TEXT>
   In an effort to save Africa and Europe from a
pest that once plagued the Western Hemisphere, the House
Agriculture Committee on Tuesday approved a bill allowing sale of
sterile screwworms to other countries.
   Sterile screwworm flies mate with fertile screwworm flies, but
produce no offspring, causing the population to eventually
disappear.
   Through intensive efforts, the pest was declared eradicated in
the United States in 1982. The government has spent millions of
dollars to kill it off in Mexico and Central America so it doesn't
return to the United States.
   ``The discovery of the pest in North Africa causes deep concern
because it potentially could spread to the Middle East and southern
European nations bordering the Mediterranean Sea,'' said Rep. Kika
de la Garza, chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
   The screwworm fly is a flesh-eating parasite that attacks all
warm-blooded animals, even humans, and is a serious threat to
livestock.
   De la Garza said that in countries, such as those in North
Africa, where drought and famine have weakened human health, people
are abnormally vulnerable to the insect.
   ``This could lead to the need for additional requests for food
aid and public health assistance in a region already burdened with
over $140 billion in external foreign debt,'' he said.
   He said that shortly after the screwworm was discovered in
Africa, the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization asked the joint
U.S.-Mexico Screwworm Commission to help.
   The only facility mass producing sterile screwworms has been
operated since 1976 by the commission in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico.
   ``The USDA (Agriculture Department) reports that it is possible
the screwworm could become the most devastating livestock and
wildlife pest on the African continent,'' said de la Garza. ``This
bill would provide the necessary authority for the USDA or the USDA
working through the commission to sell sterile flies to the Food
and Agricultural Organization.''
   The legislation is not controversial and is supported by the
Bush administration. Though the Senate has not yet acted, speedy
movement through Congress is anticipated.

   The Senate on Tuesday passed legislation
extending for two years a federal program aimed specifically at
helping stem a rising tide of school dropouts.
   The bill, approved 96-0, extends a two-year grant program,
authorizing $50 million each year to upgrade existing programs and
set up new projects.
   Supporters of the legislation cited what they said was a
worrisome Education Department report that found that 28 percent of
the country's 18- and 19-year-olds have not graduated from high
school.
   ``Over 750,000 American students will drop out of school this
year,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Labor
and Human Resources Committee.
   ``They will have many reasons for doing so, including poor
teachers, broken homes, devastated communities, poverty, drug use
and the need to go to work. Whatever the cause, their decision is a
tragedy for them and the nation.''

<TEXT>
   A network of international agreements has
eliminated cause to be ``scared to death'' of a reunited Germany,
Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said Tuesday.
   Vranitzky, who spoke at the National Press Club, also met with
President Bush at the White House, where they discussed changes in
Eastern Europe.
   ``It must be a universal delight in terms of those changes in
your neighboring countries,'' Bush told him.
   ``Absolutely right,'' said Vranitzky.
   ``A good deal of people have second thoughts or apprehension
when they hear about a united Germany,'' Vranitzky told the press
club, recalling how Germany wielded its power earlier in this
century.
   But, he said, European democracy has developed to the point
where large countries don't exert pressure on smaller ones.
Vranitzky said he sees no prospect for a repeat of 1933, when Adolf
Hitler came to power in Germany, or 1938, when Germany annexed
Austria and part of Czechoslovakia.
   ``Secondly, Europe today is characterized by a broad network of
international agreements, ... a very well-knit network for
international cooperation and for stability and security,''
Vranitzky said.
   ``So I do really not think that, as somebody said, we should be
scared to death by German unity,'' he added.
   Vranitzky, asked whether many Austrians favored a closer
political and economic union with Germany, said, ``No. The answer
is no, clear no, definite no.''
   Vranitzky, whose country decided to become permanently neutral
when the victors of World War II ended their occupation in 1955,
was asked whether he thought a united Germany should be neutral.
   ``I do not think that it is realistic to believe that Germany
will become a neutral country within any foreseeable future,'' said
Vranitzky.

<HEAD>Webster Sees Only Modest Immediate Reduction In East Bloc Spy
Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political reform in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe has made the Soviet KGB spy agency less
confrontational but the threat from foreign spies will decline only
modestly for now, the head of the CIA said Tuesday evening.
   ``I think the KGB has become less confrontational in the sense
that they avoid doing blatant or flat-footed things that would
create a major press issue,'' the CIA director, William Webster,
said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Baltimore Council on
Foreign Affairs. ``But the activity is there and it will continue.''
   The agency released a text of his remarks in Washington.
   ``Within the Soviet Union, however, there does seem to be a
movement toward relaxing KGB repression of Soviet dissidents,''
Webster said, noting a similar withering of internal secret police
activity among the KGB's allied spy agencies in Eastern Europe.
   Webster predicted the Eastern European agencies would reduce
their cooperation with Moscow but that no major reduction in their
effort to gain U.S. secrets would occur so long as the Warsaw Pact
remains in place.
   He also said that, as economic competition replaces political
and military tension between East and West, ``attempts to acquire
sensitive technology _ by all nations _ is increasing and becoming
more sophisticated.''
   Webster presented a complicated picture in Eastern Europe, where
spy agencies have operated since World War II as proxies for the
KGB.
   ``Their subservience to the KGB and GRU (Soviet military
intelligence) is due for careful review,'' he said.
   He noted that the Hungarian foreign ministry publicly
disassociated itself recently from the alleged spying efforts of
U.S. Army Sgt. Clyde Lee Conrad, arrested in West Germany in 1988
on charges of spying for a Hungarian intelligence officer.
   The foreign ministry ``declared it `an erroneous policy' pursued
by the previous leadership without regard to the country's national
interests,'' Webster said.
   But the intelligence chief cautioned that ``espionage and
counterintelligence are widely recognized in Eastern Europe as
necessary functions and the apparatus for this work is likely to
remain in place. ...The work will continue.''
   The Warsaw Pact, he said, requires that East European
intelligence services cooperate with the Soviet Union, ``so I don't
expect military intelligence collection efforts to abate _
certainly not in the near future.''
   Overall, he said, his agency hopes that new political leadership
in Eastern Europe ``will reduce some hostile intelligence activity
_ such as passing sensitive technology to the Soviets _ an activity
which is incompatible with requests for U.S. loans. But fundamental
changes in intelligence missions are not likely while the Warsaw
Pact treaty connections are still in place.''
   In addition, he said the current spy managers in East Europe
were ``picked from the old Communist loyalists and trained in the
Soviet Union'' and may be ``difficult to replace.''
   Webster said all the changes would ultimately depend on the
success of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts ``to put the
Soviet Union on the road to a more democratic government.''
   ``But the new system he is trying to create is not yet ready to
take the place of the old one he is discarding,'' Webster added.
``Economic conditions have deteriorated. Crime is increasing.
Ethnic turmoil is escalating.''
   Whether Gorbachev's responses ``will satisfy the Soviet people,
quite frankly, we don't know and neither do they.''
   He also outlined two separate rates of political change in East
Europe.
   ``Profound transformation is going on in Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland, where Communist parties
are in full retreat,'' Webster said. ``But in the Balkans, the
process of transformation is more complicated.''
   ``Political opposition is not well-developed in many of these
countries. In Bulgaria, for example, Communists stand a good chance
of playing a major role in the government after elections in May.
And in Romania, some, particularly the intellectuals and students,
are concerned that the national salvation front will simply replace
the Communist party and not offer the hoped-for change.''
   He also cited ethnic strife in Romania and Yugoslavia as an
obstacle to reform.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said a united
Germany must respect Europe's current borders and only the four
victorious Allies of World War II can determine Germany's final
status, Tass reported Tuesday.
   Gorbachev addressed the issue of German unity in an interview
with Pravda carried by Tass before it appeared Wednesday in the
Communist Party newspaper.
   Progress toward reunificaion has accelerated in recent weeks.
Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany, plagued by mass emigration and
a crumbling economy, asked on Tuesday for immediate reunification
talks under a formula worked out with the Allies.
   Modrow and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany both visited
Moscow this month to discuss unification with Gorbachev, the Soviet
president.
   Kohl said he had Gorbachev's assurance the Soviet Union would
respect the desire of Germans to have one nation.
   In the Pravda interview, Gorbachev said Germans should decide
the form and schedule of reunification, but emphasized that Germany
unity also concerns others and ``any encroachment upon the borders
of other states must be ruled out.''
   He specifically mentioned Poland's western border. Kohl's
failure to make a public pledge to respect that border prompted
Poland to request a roll in talks on reunification between the two
Germanys and the Allies.
   Both Germanys are bound by treaties to respect the frontier, but
a united country would not be, and some conservatives in West
Germany have suggested reunification be sought within the 1937
borders. In 1937, one-third of what is now Poland was German
territory.
   Gorbachev spoke in the interview of the rights of nations to
protect their interests, and said: ``I refer primarily to Poland.
The inviolability of its postwar borders, like the borders of other
states, must be guaranteed. Only an international legal act can
provide such a guarantee.''
   About a united Germany's relationship with NATO and the Warsaw
Pact, he said the alliances retain a role as a new European
security system evolves, and any disruption of the
military-strategic balance is unacceptable.
   East Germany is Moscow's most important military ally and about
two-thirds of the 575,000 Soviet troops in Eastern Europe are
stationed there.
   Emergence of a reunited Germany as a powerful economic and
military force in Central Europe has aroused concern, and Gorbachev
said in the interview:
   ``No one has a right to ignore the negative potential formed in
Germany's past, especially as it is impossible to fail to consider
people's memory of war, of its horrors and losses. Therefore, it is
very important that Germans, deciding the question of unification,
should be aware of their responsibility.
   ``This applies particularly to our country, to the Soviet
people. It has an inalienable right to expect, and the possibility
to exert efforts to ensure, that our country should not sustain
either moral or political or economic damage from German
unification.''

   A Palestinian human rights group charged
Tuesday that Israeli soldiers were carrying out ``deliberate,
cold-blooded'' killings of Palestinian suspects instead of
arresting them.
   Officials of Al Haq-Law in the Service of Man told a news
conference that its researchers documented three such cases and
were investigating 15 possible other such killings in the past year
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   An Israeli military spokesman denied Israel had any policy of
deliberate killings, and the army issued a five-sentence statement
saying it ``categorically rejects the baseless and unfounded
accusations detailed'' in the 692-page report.
   The report cited several changes in Israeli policy in the past
year that have been acknowledged by the government but which Al Haq
and other human rights organizations see as violations of
international law.
   Among these were:
   _ Increasing the initial time a suspect in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip can be held without charges or trial under
``administrative detention'' from six months to one year.
   _ Allowing soldiers to open fire at masked Palestinian suspects,
even if they are unarmed, when the suspects ignore orders to halt.
The army has said soldiers first must fire warning shots in the air
and then shoot at the suspect's legs. Al Haq noted that 17 of the
31 Palestinians killed by soldiers in October were masked men.
   _ Sealing houses of people suspected of throwing stones.
Previously, sealings and demolition of houses were used for those
suspected of firebombings or other, more serious attacks.
   The U.S. State Department and Amnesty International have
complained about administrative detentions and house demolitions as
violations of international law.
   Fatah Azzam, administrative director of Al Haq, said not enough
international pressure had been put on Israel, and the report
itself complained of unwillingness by Israeli authorities to
respond to criticism.
   ``While the use of illegal measures to suppress the uprising has
been intensified, attention has been deflected ... through the
periodic issuance of new regulations and policy statements intended
to reassure the international community,'' it said.
   As to the charges of deliberate killings, Al Haq said all three
of the victims were shot at close range, and that in two cases they
were denied needed medical attention.
   Yaser Abu Ghosh, 17, was shot by a soldier who took careful aim
and fired from a distance of seven yards as the teen-ager was being
chased July 10 in Ramallah, the report said. It said the victim
apparently received no medical treatment for more than two hours.
   Nidal Al-Habash, 21, was shot as he raised his hands to
surrender after being surrounded following a chase by soldiers in
the West Bank city of Nablus on Oct. 9, Al Haq said.
   Atwa Harzallah, 27, was stopped with four other Palestinians on
Feb. 27, 1989, in the West Bank village of Deir Ibzi and, while all
five raised their hands, soldiers shot Harzallah twice in the head,
the report said. It said two of those with Harzallah were later
arrested.
   The Al Haq report noted the army had maintained that proper
procedures were followed in the shooting of Abu Ghosh, including
shouted warnings and first shooting at the suspect's legs, but
added that eyewitness accounts contradicted this version.
   It also noted that authorities claimed Harzallah was killed
during a stone-throwing incident. It said a lawyer for his family
requested an investigation in April but has not yet received a
response.
   On Tuesday, an army spokesman said he was checking the status of
the three cases but he denied any policy of deliberate killings.
   ``We totally and completely deny any policy which calls upon
soldiers to premeditatedly kill Palestinians,'' he said.
   The army statement said: ``Al Haq is known as an organization
made up entirely of Palestinians and their supporters. It is no
surprise that the report it has presented is one-side and
negative.''
   Al Haq, which is affiliated with the International Commission of
Jurists in Geneva, Switzerland, listed 379 killings of Palestinians
by soldiers, Israeli settlers and collaborators with Israel during
the year.
   It did not give an accounting of killings of alleged
collaborators by other Palestinians and, despite repeated questions
at the news conference, its officials refused to criticize directly
the Palestinian groups who may have carried out the killings.
   Mona Rishlawi, an attorney for Al Haq, said the organization had
no way of investigating ``underground'' killings and had to hold
Israel responsible as the occupation authority.
   ``As long as the de facto authority is in the hands of the
Israeli military, it is they who are responsible,'' she said.
   According to statistics kept by The Associated Press, 658
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians
since the uprising began 26 months ago. At least 187 Palestinians
have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaboration. Forty-three Israelis have died.
   In the latest casualty, a 14-year-old Palestinian youth died
Tuesday in Tel Aviv of a gunshot wound suffered Sunday in a clash
with troops. Soldiers also shot and wounded five Arabs in the
occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.

   A bomb exploded near an army van in
the center of Leicester just before rush hour Tuesday evening,
injuring two people, blowing pedestrians off their feet and
shattering windows, officials said.
   No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on the Irish
Republican Army, which has been fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   Assistant Chief Constable Tony Butler said the van had traveled
a few hundred yards from an army recruiting center when the bomb
exploded at 4:40 p.m.
   Two army sergeants were inside.
   One, from the Women's Royal Army Corps, was taken to a hospital
suffering from shock but her colleague from the Coldstream Guards
was unhurt, the Defense Ministry said. Butler said a civilian
passer-by was cut by flying glass.
   ``I was blown off my feet,'' 82-year-old Henry Riley told the
Leicester Mercury. ``I was within yards of the explosion and it was
massive. I remember bombs falling on the city in the war. And this
sounded just the same.''
   ``The van was not badly damaged,'' said Mercury reporter Red
Williams. ``The main force of the explosion seems to have been at
the back of the vehicle, probably on the ground.''AH MESCE&equals;

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan continued his
campaign against tobacco companies Tuesday and issued a report
showing that smoking costs the country more than $52 billion
annually in health care costs and lost productivity.
   Sullivan condemned tobacco company advertising practices that
target women, minorities and young people, saying ``they must stop
their irresponsibility.''
   In testimony before the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, he also called on advertising agencies to join
anti-smoking efforts by renouncing tobacco ads and said television
stations should donate free air time to help educate viewers about
the dangers of smoking.
   Sullivan also said that while the Bush administration supports
the intent of legislation to increase regulation of tobacco
products and educate about the risks of smoking, it believes the
bill, which would cost an estimated $185 million, is unnecessary.
   The Tobacco Product Education and Health Protection Act of 1990
would establish a center as part of the federal Centers for Disease
Control to expand education efforts on smoking, conduct
smoking-related research and regulate tobacco products much as the
Food and Drug Administration regulates food products.
   The center also would administer a paid advertising program to
discourage smoking and provide incentive grants to states to
encourage enactment and better enforcement of laws prohibiting the
sale of tobacco to minors.
   Sullivan said his department yearly spends about $79 million on
anti-smoking programs, many of which duplicate the efforts proposed
in the legislaton.
   He said free public service announcements about the risks of
smoking are preferable to government-paid ads in light of other
demands on the federal budget. He also said that regulating the
additives in cigarettes, envisioned in the bill, would send the
wrong message.
   ``We're concerned that this would suggest that we believe that
under certain conditions, with certain monitoring, that tobacco is
safe,'' he said. ``We would rather see our efforts on reducing and
elmiminating by the year 2000 all tobacco from our society.''
   However, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. and chairman of the Senate
committee, noted that bottled Perrier water was pulled from the
market when it was found to contain benzene at levels up to four
times what is allowed under federal standards, while a surgeon
general's report estimated the benzene content of cigarettes is
2,000 times higher than that.
   ``The consumer has a right to know the key ingredients and
additives to a pack of cigarettes when they purchase the product,''
Kennedy said.
   Sullivan agreed that consumers should have such information.
   Charles O. Whitley, representing The Tobacco Institute, noted in
testimony submitted to the committee that Congress previously
considered and rejected disclosure of ingredient information
because it contains trade secrets. This information is supplied to
the health and human services secretary, but it does not identify
the company or brand of cigarettes.
   Whitley also said other provisions in the bill aren't needed
because young people are already aware of the risks of smoking. He
also denied that the industry targets young people in advertising
campaigns to encourage themhabit.
   He also defended the industry against critics who say that
tobacco companies target women and minorities, saying the industry
is not trying to encourage people to start smoking but rather hopes to
take up the 
to retain or gain market share from competitors.
   Sullivan released a report on the economic consequences of
smoking that estimated smoking-related disease costs each American
$221 a year largely in health-care and insurance costs.
   He said the costs average $1 billion per state annually, but
range from a high of $5.8 billion in California to a low of $82
million in Alaska. The report's analysis, the first of its kind, is
based on 1985 statistics.
   Smoking catates
annually and about 29 percent of adults smoke, he said.
   Sullivan recently criticized R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for its
plans to market a cigarette targeted at blacks. Reynolds
subsequently dropped those plans, but now intends to test-market a
cigarette called Dakota. The company had considered gearing the
cigarette toward young women with no more than a high school
education, but threw out the plan late last year and instead will
target all smokers of Philip Morris' Marlboro, Reynolds Chairman
James Johnston said.
   Sullivan has been concerned about minorities because they have
higher rates of smoking than whites and have a higher rate of
smoking-related disease and death. Among high school seniors, the
smoking rate has leveled off at around 19 percent, he said, while
lung cancer has surpassed breast cancer a cause of death among
women.

   The African National Congress said Tuesday
it has lobbied African governments to boycott proposed talks with
South African President F.W. de Klerk scheduled for this weekend in
Zaire.
   The organization also urged European governments to ignore
British calls to ease economic sanctions against South Africa.
   Britain Tuesday failed to persuade the European Community to
ease sanctions and said it would act alone to remove a British
embargo on new investment.
   De Klerk, in an effort to ease friction with black states, is to
meet Saturday in Zaire with the leaders of that country, Rwanda,
Burundi, Chad and the African Central Republic to discuss regional
issues and political developments in South Africa.
   Togo and Gabon may also be represented at the one-day meeting,
which would be the first multination conference between South
Africa's white-minority government and black African states, said
South African officials, who declined to be identified. South
African presidents have had meetings with single black heads of
state in the past.
   The meeting could clear the way for South Africa to start
establishing political and economic ties with black Africa after
years of being isolated because of its apartheid policies, the
officials said. South Africa wants to expand economic ties to help
stimulate its own economy, they said.
   De Klerk is expected to brief the black leaders on his recent
reforms, including the Feb. 11 release of Nelson Mandela and the
legalization of the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups.
   In Lusaka, ANC international affairs chief Thabo Mbeki said the
organization had approached foreign ministers of the 50-member
Organization of African Unity currently meeting in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, and urged them to stop the Zaire talks.
   ``We see no reason for De Klerk to be received. OAU policy is to
isolate apartheid. Nothing has changed. Apartheid is still there
every day,'' Mbeki told reporters in Lusaka.
   Earlier Tuesday, the ANC urged European governments to ignore
British calls to ease economic sanctions against South Africa. It
said it had appealed to all European Community governments to
coincide with a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Dublin, Ireland.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has argued that the
recent political changes introduced by de Klerk deserve an easing
of the world trade and investment boycott.
   Mbeki said the ANC reminded European governments of an agreement
in Strasbourg last December by their leaders, including Mrs.
Thatcher, that sanctions would only be reviewed after there was
``profound and irreversible change'' to end the apartheid system of
racial separation in South Africa.
   ``We are saying the EC ought to respect international agreements
it enters into,'' he said.
   He said an easing of the sanctions would encourage de Klerk to
believe he had made sufficient reforms, ``therefore he can take his
time about ending apartheid and this is to prescribe further
suffering for our people.''

<HEAD>Anglican Bishops Urged to Reject Report on Homosexuality</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Church of England were urged on
Tuesday to reject an unpublished report that recommends homosexuals
be treated with more sympathy by the church.
   The report was commissioned by the bishops in the church's
policy-making General Synod who wanted advice on dealing with
matters of homosexuality. But they decided not to publish it.
   The Rev. David Holloway, a traditionalist clergyman, told the
synod's regular February session that leaked copies of the report
indicated it contradicted a 1987 synod decision that homosexual
acts fell short of the Christian ideal.
   He said the leaked version appeared to suggest that only
one-third of the bishops held to the biblical and traditional view
of the church, which opposes homosexual relationships.
   ``While most bishops, in the words of the report, `would not
sponsor or ordain anyone whom they knew to be homosexually active,'
presumbly some would. We need reassurances,'' Holloway said.
   Holloway sought an emergency debate to discuss church leaders
who favored the homosexuality report, but no debate or vote
followed on the first day of the three-day session at Westminster.
The synod is a 574-member body of bishops, clergy and laity.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie said the bishops had no
plans to authorize publication of the report.
   ``It is not an accepted policy document. It is advice and we are
now considering it,'' said Runcie, spiritual head of the church and
leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, including 2.5 million
U.S. Episcopalians.
   Holloway told reporters later the bishops suppressed the report
for 18 months and when it was leaked it did ``enormous damage'' to
the church.
   ``What we want to discuss is the way we have got into the mess
we have got into,'' he said.
   Richard Kirker, general secretary of the Lesbian and Gay
Christian Movement, said: ``The decision to repress the report runs
contrary to principles of open government which apply in church. If
the church is not an unconditionally welcoming community determined
by love, we have no business to call ourselves Christians.''
   The suppressed document is known as the Osborne report after its
chairwoman, the Rev. June Osborne, a deaconess working in London's
East End. In 1986, the bishops asked the seven-member working party
of clergy and laity that she headed to advise them on ``how to
handle homosexuality matters in the Church of England.''
   The report was completed in 1988 but remained unpublished. This
month, copies were leaked to a television company and some
newspapers.
   The 134-page report, as summarized in the Anglican Church Times
weekly, said: ``We have been made very conscious of the poor
experience of the church encountered by many homosexual people. ...
The bishops ... have a particular responsibility to set a tone of
welcome and acceptance in these matters.''
   A Church Times editorial on Friday said the report offered
people in the Church of England the chance to re-examine their
thinking about homosexuality.
   It said the last synod debate on the subject in 1987 showed that
numbers of churchpeople disapproved of it but that was no longer an
adequate response.
   ``There are probably at least a million homosexuals in the
United Kingdom,'' the weekly said.
   ``The Church of England has homosexuals among its priests,
ordinands and worshipers. These are people who have the same need
for sexual expression in its many forms, for companionship, for
acceptance, as heterosexuals. It becomes increasingly difficult to
deny them those things and argue that the denial is merciful or
truthful or practical.''

   A recipe contest rookie won the Super Bowl of
baking Tuesday with a brunch cake inspired by her family's taste
for blueberries.
   Linda Rahman, a Petaluma, Calif., tax accountant who had never
entered a recipe contest before, was so surprised by her selection
as the grand champion in the 34th Pillsbury Bake-Off that she had
no immediate plans to use the $40,000 in first-prize money.
   But she had no question about the worth of a $10,000 kitchen
makeover included in her winnings. ``I've been in the same kitchen
for 18 years,'' she said.
   Mrs. Rahman, four other women and a man were winners in six
categories involving use of Pillsbury Co. products. Each received
$10,000, with Mrs. Rahman getting another $30,000 for devising the
top recipe overall.
   Scott Wolf of Salem, Ore., one of a record 12 men in the final
field of 100, made Bake-Off history by becoming the first male to
win a product category.
   Pillsbury said it receives more than 100,000 recipes in the
Bake-Off, which is held every two years. Applicants may submit as
many recipes as they want, but only one will be accepted per
finalist.
   Mrs. Rahman, a 44-year-old mother of two, enjoys running in the
7.8-mile Bay to Breakers distance race each spring, but said her
winning poppy seed brunch cake _ which was in the flour category _
wasn't health-inspired.
   ``Perhaps ingredients like blueberries and poppy seeds are
perceived as healthful and wholesome, not quite as decadent as
chocolate,'' she said. ``I got no negative feedback when I served
it to the neighbors.''
   She said her sons, Brian, 22, a senior in electrical engineering
at Washington State University, and Kevin, 21, a junior in
mechanical engineering at Sacramento State, both ask for steak
whenever they come home ``because we don't send them very much
money for food.''
   Mrs. Rahman graduated from San Francisco State University nine
years ago and works as a tax accountant for Pacific Bell in San
Francisco.
   Although many contestants in the 1990 event had qualified
earlier, the first time was the charm for Wolf, a 21-year-old who
loves flying and works for a company that makes aviation-navigation
equipment.
   He said he would use his prize money to move into an apartment,
complete ground school and spend another 30 hours in the air to
obtain a private pilot's license.
   Wolf's entry _ garden rice-stuffed chicken breasts _ was in the
frozen-vegetables category.
   Other $10,000 winners included Paula Cassidy of Berkeley,
Calif., for use of refrigerated pie crust; Christine Vidra of
Maumee, Ohio, cake and brownie mix; Nancy Woodside, Sonora, Calif.,
canned vegetables and mashed potato flakes; and Sharon Richardson,
Dallas, refrigerated crescent dinner roll, biscuit and pizza crust.
   Debra Wolf, 20, of Salem, Ore., Scott Wolf's sister and a
three-time finalist, was among the $2,000 winners.

<TEXT>
   East German Premier Hans Modrow, pressed by
mass emigration and a crumbling economy, appealed Tuesday for
immediate reunification talks under a formula worked out with the
Allied victors of World War II.
   Helmut Kohl, the West German chancellor, urged Modrow's
government to create a social security system as generous as West
Germany's as a means of stopping the flight.
   Kohl made a campaign trip to East Germany, lending his support
to conservatives there and telling a rally of 90,000 that his
government will provide aid to help the troubled country's social
safety net.
   The chancellor, a Christian Democrat, was repeatedly cheered by
the large crowd in the city of Erfurt, who waved West German flags
and shouted for quick unification.
   He tried to justify his refusal to give massive aid to the
current interim, Communist-led government.
   ``I was not ready to invest billions in a system if I can't see
that the citizens will benefit,'' Kohl said.
   The crowd responded by shouting, ``Helmut, Helmut.''
   More than 400,000 people have left the East for West Germany in
the past year, most of them skilled workers, after giving up hope
of significant improvement in living conditions at home.
   Kohl met with West German industrial leaders Tuesday to draft
plans for ``solidarity with East Germany,'' and told journalists
his government would help finance unemployment benefits and
pensions for East Germans.
   He was vague about the degree to which West Germany would
underwrite the costs of East Germany's transition to capitalism,
however, saying only that Bonn could provide ``start-up financing''
for the benefits.
   His references to German ``social unity'' reflected a growing
realization among West Germans that they must pay for
reunification. Kohl's government has been reluctant to make firm
deals with Modrow, a reform-minded Communist whose interim Cabinet
will govern only until free elections March 18.
   East Germany's parliament passed a constitutional amendment and
legislation Tuesday setting rules for the elections.
   The new parliament will have 400 seats, 100 fewer than the
current People's Chamber, and no minimum percentage of the vote
will be needed for a party to win seats. In West Germany, a party
must get 5 percent of the vote.
   Modrow, addressing the parliament, said representatives of the
two Germanys should ``begin preparing the `2-plus-4' conference as
soon as possible.''
   At a meeting in Ottawa, Canada, last week, the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain and France agreed with East and West Germany
on a two-stage plan for reunification.
   In the first stage of what became known as the ``2-plus-4''
formula, German experts would discuss political, economic and legal
steps to unity. In the second, the Germanys would be joined by the
Allies to discuss international ramifications.
   Modrow said parallel plans should be made for a meeting of the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   He again expressed regret that Bonn would not provide the $9
billion in immediate aid he requested. ``Such aid is in my opinion
necessary to counter a further exodus, and this should be of common
interest'' to both governments, the premier said.
   West Germany has approved the equivalent of about $3.5 billion
for projects over which Modrow's government has little control.
   East and West Germany should issue a statement guaranteeing
Poland's western borders, Modrow said. Kohl, concerned about
conservative support in the December elections, has not made a
public, unequivocal declaration that he recognizes those borders.
   About one-third of Poland was part of Germany before World War
II and the Poles have demanded inclusion in the ``2-plus-4''
because of concern over possible German claims to its territory.
Modrow supported that position Monday, but West Germany has
resisted it.
   A joint government commission of East and West Germany met in
East Berlin on Tuesday to discuss ways of achieving monetary and
economic unity.
   Earlier this month, Kohl offered to make the West German mark
the official currency of both countries. He said that would give
East Germans confidence in their future, but the East Germans fear
unemployment as inefficient factories are forced to close under a
more competitive capitalist system.
   Leaders of both countries hope monetary union will stem the
flight of about 2,000 people a day from East to West, but no
agreement is expected until after the March elections.
   East Germany is planning to end subsidies, and Modrow appealed
to citizens Tuesday not to hoard food. He reported hearing of runs
on grocery stores while prices remain low, but journalists saw no
unusual crowding at food stores in East Berlin.
   Modrow urged people to keep their money in the banks. East
Germans worry about their savings becoming worthless under a
monetary union with West Germany and have been withdrawing funds.
   He also appealed to East Germans to stay home and work for
change.

<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who ruled
Cambodia until he displeased the Americans by keeping it out of the
Indochina war, will return and live in a bamboo hut until his
country is free, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Sihanouk was overthrown in 1970, fled Cambodia when the
Vietnamese invaded in December 1978 and has lived since in the
palaces and luxury hotels of Beijing, Pyongyang, Paris and Bangkok.
   He now leads guerrillas fighting the government of Premier Hun
Sen, whom the Vietnamese installed, and spokesman Ek Seryewat said
he would take up residence Friday in a ``liberated zone'' of
northeastern Cambodia.
   Ek, a spokesman for Sihanouk in Bangkok, said the prince would
live in Oddar Meanchey province, bordering Thailand, in a house
built of bamboo.
   Before returning to Cambodia, the 67-year-old prince was
scheduled to hold another round of peace talks Wednesday with Hun
Sen in Bangkok, their first meeting in Thailand.
   All parties involved in the Cambodian conflict are scheduled to
confer Monday and Tuesday in Jakarta, Indonesia.
   The three-faction guerrilla alliance Sihanouk leads has made
substantial gains in western and northwestern Cambodia since
Vietnamese troops were withdrawn at the end of September 1989.
   ``Hun Sen may live in a palace in Phnom Penh, but there are no
palaces in the liberated zone,'' Ek said.
   He said Sihanouk would continue to travel on diplomatic
missions, but his home would be in Oddar Meanchey until ``the
liberation of the whole of Cambodia.''
   International support has grown for a negotiated peace involving
the United Nations in an interim administrative role.
   Hun Sen's government has rejected guerrilla demands that it be
dismantled before elections, contending that would leave the way
open for the Khmer Rouge to regain power.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from April 1975 until the
Vietnamese invasion, and more than 1 million people were killed or
died of starvation or disease. It now is far stronger than either
of the other two, non-Communist, guerrilla factions.
   Sihanouk and Hun Sen last met at the Paris International
Conference on Cambodia in August, but their meeting and the
conference achieved little.
   The French put Sihanouk on the throne of Cambodia when he was 19
and he led his country to independence in 1953. He was ousted by a
right-wing coup in 1970 after resisting U.S. attempts to draw
Cambodia into the war.
   In rural areas of a nation that has known little but war for
decades, Sihanouk still is revered as a god-king who brought peace.
Many of the old and new elite either dismiss him as irrelevant or
consider him a traitor who helped destroy Cambodia.

   Cuban lawmakers elected a new parliamentary
president Tuesday, four days after the Communist Party called for a
study on overhauling government institutions, the Cuban news
service Prensa Latina said.
   It said Justice Minister Juan Escalona, 59, a member of
parliament since 1981, was the only candidate and was elected in
secret, direct balloting with 458 of the 468 votes. The agency did
not account for the other 10 votes.
   Escalona presided over the 1989 prosecution of high-ranking
Interior Ministry and army officials sentenced to death for drug
trafficking, the news service said in the dispatch, which was
monitored in Mexico City.
   It said the vote followed the resignation of acting
parliamentary president Severo Aguirre, 78, who had served since
the former president, Flavio Bravo, died in early 1988.
   President Fidel Castro attended Tuesday's special legislative
session, at which deputy Zoila Benitez was elected parliamentary
vice president, it said.
   Aguirre said new leadership in parliament could contribute to
renovating the state, according to Prensa Latina.
   The Communist Party Central Committee on Friday called for a
party congress in March 1991 and proposed a study of to improve
government operations. It was the first indication Prensa Latina
has given that Cuba may consider reform.
   Escalona took part in the revolution that overthrew dictator
Fulgencio Batista in 1959, and served as chief of staff for the
western army division, Prensa Latina said.

<HEAD>Expert Says Captain Should Delegate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A key responsibility of a tanker
captain is delegating authority to other officers, an Exxon
official testified Tuesday at the trial of the skipper who gave
control of the Exxon Valdez to his third mate.
   However, ship crew coordinator William Deppe of Walnut Creek,
Calif., testified at the trial of former tanker skipper Joseph
Hazelwood that he would have remained on the ship's bridge during a
maneuver to avoid hitting ice.
   The Exxon Valdez was outside normal shipping lanes to avoid ice
in Prince William Sound when it struck Bligh Reef, ripping open its
hull and spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude oil. The
disaster killed countless birds, fish and marine mammals, and
blackened hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   Deppe, who holds a shore position with Exxon, represented the
company at the National Transportation Safety Board's hearing into
the nation's worst oil spill. He also took control of the grounded
Exxon Valdez after Hazelwood left to meet with investigators.
   Deppe holds a captain's license, and Assistant District Attorney
Brent Cole asked him numerous questions on how he would have
handled the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Deppe was reluctant to
answer on many points, saying he was not there and didn't have
enough information.
   But he appeared to support Hazelwood's decision to let Third
Mate Gregory Cousins navigate through Prince William Sound.
   ``One of the responsibiltiies a master has is to delegate a lot
of responsibility to other people,'' he said. ``If I had an officer
I had confidence in to carry out commands,'' Deppe indicated he
would trust him.
   But when Cole pressed him on what he would have done while
steaming past ice in Prince William Sound, he said: ``I probably
would have been on the bridge and not left it to the third mate.''
   Hazelwood, 43, is charged with second-degree criminal mischief,
a felony, and three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment, operating
a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to 7\ years in prison and $61,000
in fines.
   Deppe testified after jurors were shown a videotape of the Exxon
Valdez sitting on Bligh Reef, surrounded by floating black oil. The
man who shot the footage, Dan Lawn, then told of boarding the ship
and encountering Hazelwood, who Lawn said appeared sober.
   Lawn said that at one point on the morning after the accident,
he smelled what resembled ``stale beer'' on the captain's breath.
   Deppe later testified that while Exxon forbade alcohol on its
ships, the company did allow Moussey, a low-alcohol beer from
France, to be taken on board.
   The defense appeared to be laying groundwork to contend that
Hazelwood drank Moussey long after the accident, explaining why he
had a low level of alcohol in his blood 10{ hours after the
accident.

<HEAD>U.N. Convenes Special Session on Fighting Narcotics</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The General Assembly convened its first
special session on narcotics Tuesday with major drug-producing
nations and major drug-consuming nations seeking to forge an
international battle plan for the 1990s.
   The four-day session is expected to shift the previous emphasis
on stopping drug production in poor countries to a more balanced
approach which includes fighting consumption in wealthier nations.
   It is expected to consider wider issues of distribution,
marketing and money laundering, the related arms trade and sale of
manufacturing chemicals.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the session the
``most critical challenge'' facing the United States in combating
narcotics abuse is the problem of domestic consumption.
   ``As long as the demand for drugs by Americans remains
voracious, our nation faces an endless, uphill struggle to halt
supply,'' Baker said.
   A text of his prepared remarks was released by the State
Department.
   The debate began with Colombian Foreign Minister Julio Londono
Paredes telling the 159-nation assembly that for too long the
burden in the drug fight has been borne by a small number of
developing nations.
   Action must be taken on many fronts, he said, including action
against the production of manufacturing chemicals and against
corrupt officials and increased aid to developing countries to
reducing the demand for drugs.
   Paredes said Colombia believes that to fight drugs there must be
sustained growth in the producing countries and that requires the
creation of jobs, external financing and easier access of exports
to external markets.
   International cooperation is necessary, he said, but he
emphasized the responsibility of each state to control drug
trafficking. Responsibility also must include respect for the
sovereignty of other states, he said, without using drug traffic as
a lever for applying economic pressure.
   The session, with more than 100 speakers, is an effort to
develop a blueprint for international cooperation against illegal
drug supply, demand, trafficking and distribution.
   U.N. officials said the session would not focus on production by
poor Third World nations, where many farmers have little choice in
cultivation, but would look at a broad spectrum of issues. The
session aims to enhance the effectiveness of U.N. agencies in the
battle against drugs and seek more money for them.
   Mexico's attorney general, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, called
drugs ``the universal social disease ... the plague of the modern
world.''
   But he said Mexico is opposed to the creation of all
multinational military or paramilitary forces and added: ``The
sovereignty of peoples and territorial integrity are not open to
discussion. Multilateral cooperation should rest on the principle
of respect for the rights of others.''
   Del Castillo said his government supports application of an
international legal framework.
   He said it was pointless to debate whether producing or
consuming nations were more to blame. ``We all are responsible,''
he said.
   He noted that Mexico's drug consumption is relatively low,
regular users numbering only about .8 percent of the population,
mostly urban youth.
   Brazil's foreign minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, said the
focus has been on production of illegal drugs, but today there is a
greater understanding that effective action must address many
facets, from cultivation to consumption.
   Elimination of illicit crops, he said, only can be achieved
through integrated programs of rural development that provide
economically viable alternatives.
   There also is growing concern to address the problem of the
covert flow of arms to drug traffickers and to curb the
participation of mercenaries in drug-related criminal activities.
   In his address, Baker expressed hope that a U.N.-led effort to
act against drug smuggling will help the world come closer to
ending the drug scourge.
   He added that to be successful, any such program must entail
concrete commitments and be fully implemented by U.N. agencies.
   ``Certainly, we the member governments cannot ask the United
Nations to do things that we will not do at home,'' he said.
   Baker's appearance at the session, five days after the drug
summit in Colombia, was aimed at reinforcing the high priority the
Bush administration is attaching to the drug issue.

<HEAD>Senate Discusses Resolution Marking `Armenian Genocide'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday opened discussion of a
contentious resolution remembering ``Armenian genocide'' amid
potential strains in U.S.-Turkish relations and a rift between some
Republicans and the Bush administration.
   The resolution, which would set April 24 as a day of remembrance
of the ``Armenian genocide of 1915-1923,'' is sponsored by Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   About 1.5 million Armenians died during the period, victims of
the Ottoman Empire's attacks on the ethnic group. The Ottoman
Empire is now Turkey.
   ``It's time for the United States, officially, to commemorate
the Armenian genocide,'' Dole said on the floor of the Senate.
   ``For too long, we have ignored history. ... For too long, we
have failed to speak the truth about the tragedy of genocide. ...
It is time, finally, for all of us to do what is right.''
   Turkey, a NATO ally, is fiercely opposed to the measure and has
objected to the term ``genocide'' to characterize what happened to
Armenians during the period.
   Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal made his views known in
meetings last month with Dole and other senators.
   ``I am deeply concerned that if the Senate passes the
resolution, it will unwittingly slap the face of a very important
NATO ally,'' said Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., an opponent of the
resolution and the only senator to speak against it Tuesday.
   He said passage of the measure could jeopardize the upcoming
round of negotiations on base rights.
   The Turks already have banned ports of call by U.S.
nuclear-powered warships and barred flights by training missions
into a gunnery range, according to Mike McNamara, who represents
Turkey.
   Byrd called ``genocide'' a specific legal term as defined by the
Geneva Convention.
   ``I do not know whether what happened to the Armenians
constitutes `genocide,''' he said. Whatever happened was wrong, he
said.
   Discussion was expected to continue until Thursday when the
Senate is scheduled to vote to cut off debate with a cloture vote.
Sixty senators are needed to end talk so a vote can be taken.
   Dole had 61 co-sponsors when he introduced the resolution last
year. However, the measure now has only 46 co-sponsors.
   ``What has changed is the launching of a massive lobbying effort
against the resolution _ by the administration, by the government
of Turkey, by American businesses who operate in Turkey and,
regrettably, by some private organizations and individuals who
ought to be supportive of the resolution.''
   The Bush administration has publicly opposed the resolution,
although George Bush indicated during the 1988 presidential
campaign that he would be inclined to remember victims of the
Armenian slaughters.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., quoted Bush as saying in 1988 that the
United States ``must acknowledge the attempted genocide'' of the
Armemians. ```I would join Congress in commemorating the victims of
that period,''' Simon quoted Bush as saying.
   ``Clearly a different signal is coming from the White House
today,'' Simon said.
   Dole, who said he was not trying to embarrass the Turkish
government, said he is willing to introduce legislation to ban any
possible reparations to the Armenians.

American Wetlands Conservation Council.
   Two Interior Department officials are ex-officio members of the
council, formed by legislation last year to guide the purchase of
wetlands important for migratory birds.
   The legislation carries out a 1986 agreement between the United
States and Canada aimed at improving 6 million acres of wetlands in
both countries. The new council will recommend acquisitions and
other projects to the existing Migratory Bird Conservation
Commission. Mexico agreed in 1988 to cooperate with the effort.
   President Bush has said he wants a goal of ``no net loss'' of
wetlands.
   The new appointments:
   _Peter F. Bontadelli, director of the California Department of
Fish and Game.
   _Gary Meyers, executive director, Tennessee Wildlife Resources
Agency.
   _W. Alan Wentz, undersecretary of the Kansas Department of

   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
told a rally of 90,000 cheering East Germans Tuesday that his
government will provide massive aid to help the troubled country's
social safety net.
   West German politicians, who themselves face the voters in
December, are increasingly using East Germany's election campaign
to promote their own causes.
   With plans for reunification moving quickly, West German
politicians are also trying to enlist supporters in East Germany
for future elections.
   The West Germans also are lending campaign support to their
inexperienced sister parties in East Germany and allied groups that
have sprung up since the peaceful pro-democracy revolution in
October and the ouster of the hard-line Communist government.
   The country's first free elections are on March 18.
   Kohl, a Christian Democrat, was lending support to East
Germany's conservatives. He was repeatedly cheered by the large
crowd waving West German flags and calling for quick unification.
   The rally was organized by the so-called ``Alliance for
Germany,'' a group comprising the East German Christian Democrats,
the German Social Union and Democratic Awakening.
   The Christian Democrats are trying to shake off 40 years of past
association with the Communists.
   Kohl took a swipe at the opposition Social Democrats and their
veteran leader Willy Brandt, saying Brandt only one year ago
dismissed German unity as unrealistic.
   East German Social Democrats are widely predicted to win the
March election. Brandt remains hugely popular in East Germany and
has often spokesn at rallies there. East German Social Democrats
have said they will make Brandt their honorary chairman as well.
   Addressing fears about the planned introduction of the West
German mark as East Germany's currency, Kohl said his government
will help East Germany develop a similar comprehensive social
security network that is enjoyed by West Germans.
   East Germans have expressed fears that the switch to West
Germany's mighty mark will wipe out their savings, erode the value
of pensions and trigger massive umemployment as the transition to
capitalism forces unprofitable enterprises to close.
   But Kohl said his government will take care of the jobless,
pensioners and others who might be affected by the switch in
currency.
   Kohl tried to justify his refusal to give massive aid to the
current interim, Communist-led government.
   ``I was not ready to invest billions in a system if I can't see
that the citizens will benefit,'' Kohl said.
   The crowd responded by shouting, ``Helmut, Helmut!''
   Lothar de Maiziere, the Christian Democrat leader, received loud
cheers when he said German unity will come ``because the people
want it.''

   The expected suspension of 13 striking
United Mine Workers chilled any celebration in this eastern
Kentucky coal town over Tuesday's end to the strike against the
Pittston Coal Group.
   Some area business owners and residents were relieved to hear
that the UMW rank and file in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky
approved the contract, 63 percent to 37 percent.
   ``Everybody's just tickled that it's over,'' said Eva Ryan, who
operates a motel in Toler near the Kentucky-West Virginia border.
``Everybody's for the miners. We want them to get what they want.''
   In the Charleston, W.Va., area, sighs of relief also replaced
the tension.
   ``We are overjoyed,'' said Mark Spurlock, a Logan County
commissioner. ``It is always a source of concern to everyone in
Logan County when there is an interruption of work in the coal
mines. It's hard on everyone, specifically the miners.
   ``When the mining industry gets sick, Logan County gets
pneumonia. We're overjoyed that it's been settled, apparently with
a contract that's well thought of by the miners, who are going back
to work.''
   Gov. Gaston Caperton's spokesman also welcomed the announcement.
   ``The governor's principal viewpoint was that there are many
families here who have suffered some real hardship during the
10-month coal strike,'' said spokesman G.C. Morse. ``For their sake
and their communities, this is certainly a good day for West
Virginia.''
   The topic on the minds of many, however, was the fate of the 13
miners the UMW expects Pittston suspend for alleged misconduct
during the strike.
   Members of Local Union 5737 at McAndrews campaigned to defeat
the contract because it failed to guarantee the 13 miners' jobs.
Three of them belong to the local in eastern Pike County.
   Many miners had expected the local to handily defeat the
contract as a statement of union solidarity for the 13 workers.
   They spoke bitterly about the local's surprisingly narrow
rejection of the agreement: 93 votes in favor and 96 against.
   ``To me, it's the end of the union,'' said Ann Osborne, the wife
of a striking miner. ``I still say a man who voted yes on that
contract is no better than a scab who went to Virginia.''
   Mrs. Osborne, who runs Osborne's Midnite Video, said the narrow
vote in Kentucky revealed a fatal crack in unity among the miners.
   Jack Clevenger Jr., a retired miner, said those who voted for
the contract ``were independent people voting for themselves.''
   The high rate of approval for the contract probably will cause
tension in the local, he said.
   ``It's a sore and it's going to take time to heal it. But time
will heal it,'' Clevenger said.
   The specific allegations against the 13 miners would be detailed
after contract ratification, said Glenn Stanley, the local's
president. The cases then would be turned over to an arbitrator for
settlement.
   Dave Scott, a striking miner, said the suspended miners were
meeting in Virginia to discuss their fates with UMW Vice President
Cecil Roberts.

   Snow continued to cover parts of the Plains, West and Pacific
Northwest on Tuesday, while rains that had caused flooding in the
South abated.
   Winter storm warnings were posted Tuesday for parts of New
Mexico, the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas, and west-central and
southwest Kansas.
   Up to 5 inches of snow fell in the Dalhart, Texas, area, and as
much as 5 inches of snow across three Kansas counties. Two inches
fell at Guyman, Okla., and as much as 6 inches in Oklahoma's
Cimarron County.
   Advisories for snow across parts of Colorado were lifted Tuesday
morning. after 8 inches of new snow covered Trinidad, 12 inches
across the south side of Trinidad, 8 inches at Walsenburg, and 7
inches at La Junta.
   A winter storm warning was posted for the Washington Cascades
Tuesday after Snoqualmie and Stevens Passes both got about 8 inches
of snow.
   Early Tuesday afternoon snow fell across northern New Mexico,
much of Colorado, southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, the Oklahoma
Panhandle and the northwest part of the Texas Panhandle. Rain
extended across the rest of the Texas Panhandle into northwest
Texas.
   Snow also fell in eastern Washington state. Rain in western
Oregon and western Washington became snow in higher elevations.
   Storms that dumped nearly 3 inches of rain Sunday night in south
Alabama increased the concern of residents, especially with the
predictions of another storm system due to enter the state around
Thursday.
   ``It's not going to be good because all the reservoirs are
basically full and the ground is still saturated,'' said Brian
Peters, a meterologist with the National Weather Service in
Birmingham.
   The weather service at Mobile predicted 5 to 8 inches of
rainfall by Thursday, and meteorologist Jim Hyder said the
Tombigbee, Alabama and Mobile rivers in Alabama can expect crests
well above flood stage this week and next.
   Advisories for wind chills Tuesday were in effect for northern
Maine and New Hampshire. Winds gusted to 53 mph at Montpelier, Vt.
Gusty winds and cold temperatures combined to produce very cold
wind chills.
   Record low temperatures for the date were set in the West.
   Redding, Calif., reached 27 degrees, breaking the 1985 record of
32; Reno, Nev., cooled to 6 degrees, plummeting below the 9-degree
reading of 1903, and the Alameda (Calif.) Naval Air Station broke
the 1976 record of 42 with a 39-degree reading.
   The low for the Lower 48 Tuesday: 24 degrees below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   In Alaska, there was no place like Nome, where the average daily
temperature for the first 19 days of February was 17 degrees below
zero. That's more than 20 degrees lower than normal.
   Monday was the 10th day at Nome with a high temperature of 10
degrees below zero or lower.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 1 degree
below zero at Limestone, Maine, to 84 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla.

<TEXT>
   The ruling Sandinistas traded boasts
and accusations with the opposition Tuesday, and outside observers
checked everything from paper ballots to computers for the weekend
election.
   ``In the remote chance that we lose, I will personally
congratulate my adversary the way they do it in all the
democracies,'' opposition presidential candidate Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro said in a speech to 400 chanting supporters.
   It was the second campaign speech billed as the last of her
campaign. By law, campaigning stops at midnight Wednesday and the
United National Opposition alliance that backs Mrs. Chamorro held a
rally Sunday that she said would close out her public campaign.
   President Daniel Ortega's campaign manager said the Sandinistas
would win an election certified as fair by international observers,
and predicted the United States would be friendlier afterward.
   ``We're optimistic about the future,'' Bayardo Arce told
reporters. ``We expect President Bush to divorce himself from the
policies that he inherited from President Reagan.''
   Reiterating a Sandinista campaign theme, Arce said a U.S.
embargo and Washington's support for the Contra rebels were
responsible for Nicaragua's economic crisis.
   He said the voters knew that, and ``also know the efforts the
government has made to implement policies to protect the poorest
sectors of society.''
   Alfredo Cesar, chief strategist for Mrs. Chamorro, predicted UNO
would win on Sunday with 55 percent of the vote to 40 percent for
the Sandinistas.
   Arce said the Sandinistas would relinquish power in the
``hypothetical case'' of an opposition victory, but other
Sandinista officials have said they would not necessarily give up
control of the army or police.
   ``The military will have a place in our society but they will
not be the directors of national life,'' Mrs. Chamorro said.
   ``The whole thing is in Ortega's hands,'' Cesar said in an
interview. ``If he concedes defeat, there's nothing the others can
do.''
   Ortega agreed to the election as part of a Central American
accord also designed to disband the Contra force organized in 1981,
two years after the Sandinistas overthrew President Anastasio
Somoza.
   It pits the Sandinistas against the 14-party UNO coalition and
eight other parties. A president, vice president, 90-member
National Assembly and local officials are to be chosen for six-year
terms.
   Recent independent polls have shown the Sandinistas leading, but
their accuracy is questionable because so many Nicaraguans are
afraid to reveal their true feelings to a stranger.
   Hotels were filled long ago by official observers, unofficial
observers and journalists. Some late arrivals said they were bumped
despite numerous confirmations and sought beds in private houses.
   Every rental car in Managua was gone by Tuesday and the
government was getting $100 a day plus mileage for battered
Soviet-made Ladas. Official observer missions use white buses and
four-wheel-drive vehicles.
   Among the observers arriving Tuesday was Elliot Richardson, a
former U.S. attorney general who heads the U.N. team.
   ``The mission has over the last week significantly increased its
observer force, amounting now to over 200 election monitors who
will be deployed in 100 teams of two across the length and breadth
of the national territory,'' he said in a statement.
   A practice run-through of election procedures was being planned
at the central election center. The Supreme Electoral Council
issued a statement saying it would make the official count and
issue the results, however many observers were present.
   Arce congratulated Mrs. Chamorro on the ``conciliatory'' tone of
her final campaign speech Sunday, but said ``violent elements'' in
the opposition were ignoring her.
   He said 14 Sandinista party activists had been killed by Contra
rebels since December and repeated accusations that Mrs. Chamorro's
supporters hoped to obscure a Sandinista victory with violence.
   On Monday the government said nine people had been killed in the
past week in clashes with Contras, but claimed that was not an
increase in rebel activity. The civil war has continued at a low
level despite the end of U.S. lethal aid to the Contras.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they did not expect any real disruption by the Contras.
   The opposition accused the Sandinistas of political murder in
the shooting death Monday of Fernando Jesus Moya Jimenez, an
18-year-old alliance activist. Relatives gathered Tuesday at his
coffin, which was draped with a UNO banner.
   Police said Moya was shot while trying to rob a woman on the
street.
   In downtown Managua, where blocks of buildings wrecked in a 1972
earthquake have not been rebuilt, workmen constructed a podium and
grandstands for the closing Sandinista rally Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Former ``shock TV'' talk show host Morton
Downey Jr. has only $100 in his pocket, and is seeking protection
from a limousine company and other creditors under federal
bankruptcy laws, court papers indicate.
   Downey listed liabilities of nearly $2.4 million, including a
mortgage of $628,000 and federal taxes of $500,000, in a petition
filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court seeking protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   Downey, who lives in suburban Englewood, listed assets that
include commissions and syndication rights worth $6.3 million and
$500,000 in real property, according to financial statements that
also say he has only $320 in the bank and $100 cash on hand.
   Downey attorney Brian D. Spector would not comment on whether
Downey's financial troubles were related to the demise of ``The
Morton Downey Jr. Show,'' a nationally syndicated talk program that
featured the host ranting about issues and taunting guests until it
was canceled after two years.
   In May 1989, Downey said he was attacked by skinheads who cut
his hair and drew swastikas on his face in a restroom at a San
Francisco airport. No arrests were made, and police said they had
no evidence to support his claim.
   Downey's creditors include more than 75 banks, businesses and
agencies _ including posh New York boutiques and restaurants _ a
New Jersey limousine service and New York City's Parking Violations
Bureau, court papers said.
   Listed among the 20 largest unsecured creditors are the
exclusive New York jewelers Bulgari and Cartier, which he owes
$24,000 and $9,000, respectively. The list includes debts of
$76,000 on American Express Platinum and Gold cards, the court
papers said.
   Downey also acknowledged owing money to Flexilease, an Aberdeen
leasing company that sued him last year for $35,000, claiming a
Lincoln limousine he leased was returned with shoddy repair work
and urine in the crystal decanters.
   ``He made the car into a trash can,'' Flexilease owner Frank
McGrath said, adding that Downey defaulted on monthly payments.
   Spector said his client was out of town until next week, and he
would advise him not to comment because of the sensitive nature of
bankruptcy filings.
   A pioneer of shock television, ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show''
initially enjoyed good ratings after its debut in October 1987, but
began a slide as Downey repeatedly got in trouble with the law. The
show was canceled in September 1989.
   Downey was charged at least twice with assaulting guests on the
show, including a gay-rights activist. In April 1989, Downey was
acquitted on charges that he slapped the gay-rights activist. The
other case was dropped.

<HEAD>Boat People Injured In Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting between Vietnamese boat people armed
with homemade weapons broke out Tuesday at the troubled Whitehead
Camp detention center, and seven people were injured, an official
said.
   Four of the seven were hospitalized, he said.
   Earlier in the day, four Vietnamese at the same camp slashed
their abdomens in apparent protest of the Hong Kong policy to
repatriate boat people against their will.
   The four men, ages 25 to 40, were hurried to a hospital after
injuring themselves with homemade weapons, said government
spokeswoman Winnie To. Their wounds were not serious and they left
the hospital after refusing treatment, she said.
   Four other boat people facing repatriation injured themselves in
a similar fashion earlier this year at the detention center. They
all survived, but another Vietnamese man hanged himself Friday
after being denied refugee status.
   About 44,000 Vietnamese boat people languishing in Hong Kong
camps face repatriation to their communist homeland unless they can
show a well-founded fear of persecution.
   Tension has increased in the detention centers since a first
batch of Vietnamese were sent home against their will in December,
and there have been several outbreaks of factional fighting.
   About 60 boat people were involved in the clash Tuesday in a
section of the camp housing Vietnamese from the northern port city
of Haiphong, said Ish Bhagat, a top official in charge of the
camps. Tension reportedly was running high among Haiphong people
from different areas of the city.
   Reinforcements were called in to help 120 police and other
security forces quell the violence, Bhagat told government-funded
radio.

   The U.N. Human Rights Commission, ignoring a plea
from Panama, censured the United States Tuesday for the invasion
that toppled the regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega last December.
   The 43-nation body voted 14-8 to adopt a resolution introduced
by Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Raul Roa that denounced the action
as a ``flagrant violation of international law'' and stressed the
right of the people of Panama ``to decide its future in free and
sovereign fashion.''
   Panama, the United States and six other Western countries cast
dissenting ballots. Seventeen delegations, including most Third
World nations and some Western countries abstained, arguing that
the commission was not an appropriate forum to discuss the issue.
Four nations did not vote.
   Panama's chief delegate, Osvaldo Velasquez, who headed his
country's human rights commission for 10 years under the military
regime, said there was ``no sincerity'' in the measure sponsored by
Libya, Vietnam, and Nicaragua.
   ``Never in these 10 years did we ever hear Cuba defend the human
rights of the Panamanians who suffered the worst breaches of those
rights in the world,'' he told the commission.
   U.S. Ambassador Morris B. Abram said the United States was
voting against the resolution ``with regret that such a document
was ever presented.''
   Voting in favor of the resolution on the U.S. invasion were
Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Hungary, India,
Iraq, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Soviet Ukraine, Soviet Union and
Yugoslavia. Voting against were Canada, West Germany, Italy, Japan,
Panama, Portugal, Britain and the United States.
   Abstaining were Argentina, Belgium, Botswana, Colombia, France,
Ghana, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the
Philippines, Somalia, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden and Venezuela.

   A police patrol killed 11 leftist guerrillas
in two jungle battles, the interior ministry said Tuesday.
   The ministry said in a communique that a 30-man police patrol
killed five guerrillas Saturday near the jungle town of Andamarca,
165 miles east of the capital.
   Police pursued rebels who escaped the battle and caught up with
them Sunday, killing six, the statement said. Police recovered
arms, ammunition and explosives after the battle, it said.
   The communique reported no casualties among the police.
   It did not specify which rebel group the guerrillas belonged to,
but police said previously that Maoist Shining Path rebels have
been involved in recent attacks in the Andamarca area.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a smaller and less
radical guerrilla movement, also operates in the region.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency in 1980 in the
southern highlands, while the Revolutionary Movement took up arms
in 1984.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in the 10
years of violence, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.

<TEXT>
   The FBI said Tuesday it was investigating
possible civil rights violations in the savage beating of a state
prison inmate allegedly attacked by guards, three of whom were
suspended with pay.
   Corrections Department spokesman Joseph DiNitto confirmed that
three guards were suspended Jan. 17 in connection with the Nov. 19
beating of Donald R. Coulter, who was held on a charge he assaulted
his girlfriend's 13-month-old son.
   ``We completed our investigation on these three people ... and
feel that there might be some need for prosecution,'' DiNitto said.
   FBI spokesman Paul Cavanagh in Boston said the bureau had begun
an inquiry at the request of Corrections Department officials and
would work with federal prosecutors in Providence as well as the
Justice Department's civil rights section in Washington.
   ``I think it will be less complicated than some,'' Cavanagh said
of the investigation, but gave no details.
   Two other guards who cooperated in the investigation were put on
administrative leave after they complained of harassment by their
colleagues, said John Sabalewski, president of the Rhode Island
Brotherhood of Corrections Officers.
   DiNitto refused to discuss those two guards, but Sabalewski
confirmed that they alleged fellow guards had harassed them and
refused to work with them.
   ``They did have a hard time for various reasons, but I don't
want to get into them because the investigation's still going on,''
said Sabalewski, who would not identify them.
   He said the administration had declined his offer to meet over
the pair's grievances. Administrative leave ``doesn't solve
anything,'' he said. ``If anything, it creates a problem. When they
do come back they still have to deal with the problem.''
   DiNitto said the three guards would remain suspended until a
departmental hearing next week.
   Sabalewski called the process ``a farce'' and charged that
discipline decisions were made beforehand. He said the guards
denied the charges.
   ``There's a possibility the inmate was beaten before he ever got
into the institution,'' Sabalewski said, declining to elaborate.
   Coulter, 33, of Cranston, who was charged with first-degree
child abuse, was beaten so badly the day of his arrest that he was
hospitalized and missed his court appearance the next day, The
Providence Journal-Bulletin reported.
   He allegedly was cornered in a holding cell at the Adult
Correctional Institutions and beaten by guards, the newspaper
quoted an unidentified source as saying.
   Corrections officials refused comment at the time, even after
Coulter was admitted to Rhode Island Hospital with multiple
bruises, a swollen face and broken ribs. Doctors also found a
spinal abnormality they said could have been caused by the beating,
the newspaper said.
   Coulter, who has been unable to post $150,000 bond, remains in
protective custody, the newspaper said.

   Iran's government said Tuesday that the
British Broadcasting Corp.'s Iranian correspondent in Tehran will
not be allowed to report for the network in retalitation for
Britain's deportation of Iranians earlier this month.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
said the government ``closed down the British Broadcasting Corp.'s
office in Tehran in reprisal for London's hostile attitude toward
Iranian citizens in that country.''
   The British Home Office deported nine Iranians, including the
bureau chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting networks,
for ``reasons of national security because their activities were
not conducive to the public good.''
   The BBC does not have a bureau in Tehran. A BBC editor in
London, who declined to be identified, told The Associated Press
earlier this month the state-financed broadcasting system does
``not have a staff correspondent in Iran at present.''
   IRNA referred to an Iranian working part time for the BBC's
London-based radio service as ``the head of the BBC in Iran.''

   The cavernous Shrine Auditorium bustled with
activity Tuesday as producers tuned up musicians, performers,
presenters and stage crews for the recording industry's 32nd annual
Grammy Awards show.
   Stars such as Bette Midler and Michael Bolton rehearsed songs
they will perform Wednesday during the three-hour CBS-TV broadcast
of the presentations, while show workers and executives were fitted
for tuxedos.
   Miss Midler's recording of ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' from the
movie ``Beaches'' drew a nomination for best female pop vocal and
song of the year.
   Bolton is up for best male pop vocal for ``How Am I Supposed To
Live Without You,'' against the stiff competition of Prince,
Richard Marx, Billy Joel and the late Roy Orbison.
   The show required 150 tuxedos for band members, camera operators
and production executives, among others. Lower-ranking workers got
a ``basic'' tuxedo; VIPs had a choice of single- and
double-breasted Pierre Cardin tuxedos, said outfitter Frankie
Windom of Frankie's Formal Attire.
   ``We'll probably be working into the late, late night,'' Windom
said.
   The catering company Ambrosia, for two years the caterer to the
Academy Awards' Governors Ball, prepared to serve 1,500 meals from
eight menus for everyone from technical service workers to
celebrities, starting at 8 a.m.
   The celebrity menu featured upscale, healthy and easy to eat
food, including organic vegetable crudites, chicken pecan skewers
and homemade potato chips and fruit platters, said Ambrosia owner
Carl Bendix.
   The Grammys, so called because the trophy is shaped like an
old-fashioned gramophone, are presented by the National Academy of
Recording Arts &amp; Sciences.
   This year there were 388 nominees in 77 categories. Sixty-one
awards will be presented in a non-televised ceremony from 2:30 p.m.
to 4 p.m. Wednesday. Sixteen trophies will be awarded during the
broadcast portion.
   Tape-delayed on the West Coast, the broadcast goes live to the
East beginning at 5 p.m. PST. Comedian and television star Garry
Shandling was to be the host and more than a dozen nominated
artists are scheduled to perform.
   Paul McCartney and jazz artist Miles Davis will each receive the
Academy's Lifetime Achievement Awards.
   The show could turn into an ersatz Beatles reunion. In addition
to McCartney's award, George Harrison is up for a Grammy as a
member of the all-star Traveling Wilburys and Ringo Starr was
nominated along with Buck Owens for best country vocal
collaboration on the single ``Act Naturally.''

   Britain on Tuesday failed to persuade the
European Community to ease sanctions against South Africa and
announced it would go ahead and lift an embargo on new investment.
It said it had U.S. support for such an action.
   ``We need to give support to ... (South African) President de
Klerk, who has taken his political life in his hands,'' British
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd declared after a daylong meeting of
foreign ministers of the wealthy, 12-nation trade bloc ended in
deadlock.
   ``It is not enough to sit back and say, `That's encouraging,
let's see what you do next,''' he said.
   Hurd said President Bush wrote British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher on Tuesday ``analyzing the legal situation imposed by
Congress.'' Bush is prevented by Congress from lifting sanctions
until South Africa fulfills strict conditions.
   ``He (Bush) went on to say the steps we are taking are positive
and added that he feels very strongly that when someone does what
you are asking him, you should recognize that fact,'' Hurd said.
   The foreign ministers rejected a British compromise to delay
action if all 12 nations pledged to scrap the 1986 investment
embargo when South Africa lifts the state of emergency and to end
all embargoes when black and white leaders start negotiations.
   The community said in a statement that the white-dominated
government's political reforms ``while welcome ... do not yet go
far enough.''
   The ministers decided to send a three-nation, fact-finding
mission to South Africa. The countries _ France, Ireland and Italy
_ are the past, present and next holders of the community's
rotating presidency.
   Hurd said while Britain did not oppose the mission, ``It did not
meet the case. It would be interpreted as a signal by the 12
delaying rather than encouraging.''
   Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins said unilateral action
would damage ``the credibility of European political cooperation.''
   ``This would be a dangerous precedent ... and I would appeal to
everyone here not to embark on such such a course.''
   Collins said the community did agree to lift cultural and
scientific restrictions, on the understanding ``that our objective
in doing this is to contribute to the ending of apartheid.''
   Mrs. Thatcher ended those restrictions this month when President
F.W. de Klerk announced far-reaching reforms, including legalizing
the African National Congress and then releasing black leader
Nelson Mandela.
   She argues that unless de Klerk can show some positive
international response to his actions, he could be toppled in a
white backlash.
   Only Portugal _ like Britain a former colonial power in Africa _
gave Hurd some support before finally going with the majority.
   Hurd said Britain's long and often lone policy of opposing
sanctions had paid off in persuading white South Africans, through
encouragement, to move away from apartheid.
   He said Britain will end the investment ban with an announcement
in Parliament by the Trade Department, adding: ``I see no reason
for delay.''
   The ban on new investment is among the ``voluntary'' measues
against South Africa imposed by the EC in 1986. It also imposed
four binding measures _ bans on importing South African gold coins,
iron and steel and on arms exports.
   Britain is the largest single foreign investor in South Africa,
although several major British corporations and the London-based
Barclays Bank pulled out because of pressure from anti-apartheid
groups.
   South Africa's biggest foreign trading partners are four EC
nations _ Britian, West Germany, Italy and France _ and the United
States and Japan.
   In a separate development, the foreign ministers urged that a
35-nation East-West committee be set up to prepare for a summit due
this year of the Conference of European Security and Cooperation.
The summit is to address the effects of German unification on other
nations.
   Earlier, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
pledged that a united Germany would be a stabilizing force in
Europe and scrupulously honor existing borders.
   Italian Foreign Affairs Minister Gianni de Michelis cautioned
the European Community not to focus exclusively on East Germany in
its review of the momentous developments in Eastern Europe. His
aides quoted him as saying the other emerging democracies should
get equal attention.
   Genscher assured him that West Germany shared this view.
   Also, the EC ministers in a closing statement urged Israel not
to settle Soviet Jews in the occupied lands, saying it would
endanger the Middle East peace process.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Presents New Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Michael Wilson presented a 1990
budget Tuesday that tightens the government's belt, squeezes
payments to the provinces and, in a highly unusual move, levies no
new taxes.
   However, Canadians will still pay more to the government this
year, because tax increases left over from the 1989 budget take
full effect in 1990.
   In a move expected to calm jittery money markets, the finance
minister saved $2.3 billion to hold the Conservative government's
annual deficit to $23.74 billion for the fiscal year ending March
31, 1991.
   That deficit figure is only $417 million higher than Wilson
predicted last year _ and is lower than the $25.4 billion deficit
expected for the current fiscal year.
   The finance minister said at a news conference he believes his
steps to control spending and the deficit should pave the way to
lower inflation and interest rates.
   ``I believe ... that we are going to see inflation come under
better control and as we see that happen, then we will be able to
see that reflected in lower interest rates,'' Wilson said. He did
not say how quickly he expected interest rates to fall.
   The Bank of Canada has kept interest rates relatively high to
battle inflation, and interest rates jumped sharply last week to
shore up the sagging Canadian dollar.
   Under the new budget, federal spending will increase 3.4 percent
to $123.1 billion in 1990-91 from $119 billion in the last fiscal
year.
   But Wilson said his measures to control spending increases _
including steps taken in December _ saved $2.5 billion.
   Other highlights of the 1990-1991 budget include:
   _ Transfer payments to the provinces will rise by $.83 billion
less than expected, for a national increase of 3 percent. Ontario,
Alberta and British Columbia will receive only 2.3 percent more
than last year, and the poorer provinces will get 4 percent more
for health, post-secondary education and welfare.
   _ Spending on defense, foreign aid, science and technology will
be limited to a 5 percent increase, approximately the rate of
inflation.
   _ Outright grants to business will be virtually eliminated and
government loans will be harder to get.
   Canadians will still feel a heavier tax bite, because increases
announced in the 1989 budget take full effect this year. Taxpayers
will pay $3.8 billion more in personal income taxes this year _ a
9.1 percent increase from 1989.
   Wilson said his 1990 budget will help reduce the burden of
carrying the government's $303 billion debt, but the biggest
improvement won't come for at least three years.
   He said in his speech that tough times lie ahead for the
Canadian economy.
   ``This will not be an easy year,'' he told the Commons, which
now must debate the budget.
   Finance Department officials said the seven-year economic boom
in Canada has come to an abrupt halt. They said a recession _
defined as six months of negative economic growth _ is not forecast
but is within the margin of error of Wilson's predictions.
   Wilson said he expects the economy will grow about 1.3 percent
this year after accounting for inflation, down from 2.6 percent for
1989.
   But there will be little or no growth for the first six months
of this year, he said.

<HEAD>Bush Cites Engineers Who Developed Semiconductor Microchip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday presented the first
Charles Stark Draper Award to two Texas engineers who developed the
semiconductor microchip, an invention that ``helped America change
the world.''
   Jack S. Kilby and Robert Noyce, working separately in the 1950s,
developed the microchip, also known as the integrated circuit.
   ``Integrated circuits have enabled us to do the unimaginable,''
Bush said at an awards ceremony at the State Department. ``Now, it
is unimaginable to believe we could ever live without them.
   ``The microchip ... helped America change the world.''
   The integrated circuit incorporates a large number of
transistors on a single, tiny piece of silicon.
   Kilby is chief technical officer of the Houston Area Research
Center; Noyce is president and chief executive officer of Austin's
Sematech, a research consortium of high technology companies.
   The two men, who are recognized by the scientific and
engineering community as independent co-inventors of the monolithic
integrated circuit, will share the $350,000 award.
   The Draper award for engineering achievement is sponsored by the
National Academy of Engineering. It was established in 1988 with an
endowment by the Cambridge, Mass.-based Charles Stark Draper
Laboratory.
   The prize will be awarded every two years to individuals who
have contributed significantly to the advancement of engineering
and whose achievements have produced important benefits to the
``well-being and freedom of all humanity.''
   Bush said the microchip, in addition to transforming everyday
life with such items as computers and calculators, ``has stirred
the new breeze of democracy'' across the world.
   During a visit Tuesday with Vaclev Havel, the new president of
Czechoslovakia, Bush said he thought about how the microchip had
helped provide images that ``linked the peoples of Prague and
Warsaw, Budapest and Berlin; images of bravery and defiance, of
humanity's quest for freedom.''
   ``And it was the microchip which carried (those images) from one
nation to another, becoming an instrument of liberty and the symbol
of the information age.''
   Microchips are used in products ranging from medical equipment
to calculators and watches. Their invention provided for storing
and manipulating information in a very small space, replacing the
need for miniaturized components such as transistors.
   ``Very few things have changed the world as dramatically as the
integrated circuit,'' Robert M. White, president of the National
Academy of Engineering, said in a statement. ``The development of
the integrated circuit was the single-most important event that
helped to usher in the Information Age.''
   Since Kilby and Noyce pioneered the chip, the
information-processing capacity of a single chip has doubled about
every three years.

<TEXT>
   President Bush gave investment and trade
rewards to Czechoslovakia Tuesday for overthrowing communist rule
but told President Vaclav Havel the United States wouldn't retreat
from a precautionary ``strong military presence'' in Europe.
   Bush gave a warm welcome to the first of Eastern Europe's new
reform leaders to visit the White House.
   He called Havel, a onetime dissident playwright who went from
prison to the presidency in a year's time, ``a man of tremendous
moral courage, one of the heroes of the revolution of '89.''
   The two leaders talked for 2{ hours, in the Oval Office and over
lunch.
   Afterward, Havel said the talks had been ``very warm, very open,
very friendly,'' and he invited Bush to visit Prague.
   Bush announced a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment that
restricts trade relations with communist nations that inhibit
Jewish emigration.
   The waiver clears the way for negotiation of a trade agreement
and the eventual award of most-favored nation trading status, which
would provide Czechoslovakia the most liberal access possible to
American markets. In return, the Czechoslovak Parliament would have
to enact a law ending the former communist government's restrictive
emigration policies.
   Bush also authorized the Export-Import Bank to operate in Prague
and said he would support readmission of Czechoslovakia to the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Bush authorized sending
Peace Corps volunteers to Czechoslovakia by autumn to teach English.
   Regarding military forces, Havel has called for disarmament
throughout Europe and has asked the Soviet Union to withdraw the
75,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia. Some Czechoslovak leaders
have called for eventual dissolution of NATO, along with the Warsaw
Pact, the Soviet-led alliance to which Czechoslovakia belongs.
   Interviewed on The ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' on public
television, Havel Havel said the Soviets want to withdraw but are
unable to feed and house the troops at home.
   ``The security system was based on two conflicting blocks, and
this era is soon to be over,'' Havel said. ``At this moment it's
not quite clear to me who could be a potential enemy of
Czechoslovakia.''
   Asked if a play could be written about the experience of his
country, Havel replied, ``It's a great drama with features of all
dramatic genres from Greek tragedy to absurdist drama, but it is a
play so thrilling and so peculiar that no earthling could have
invented it and written it.''
   In his public comments, Bush said, ``I know I can speak for all
Western leaders when I say that the Atlantic Alliance will continue
to play a vital role in assuring stability and security in Europe
at this great and historic moment.
   ``And America will continue to play its part, including a strong
military presence for our security and for Europe's,'' said Bush,
who has proposed that the United States and Soviet Union reduce
their troops in Central Europe to 195,000 on each side.
   Bush, in the private discussions, talked at length about a need
for U.S. troops in Europe and portrayed NATO as a stabilizing
factor at a time of great transition, said Assistant Secretary of
State Raymond Seitz.
   Seitz quoted Havel as saying, ``There is no doubt about the
stabilizing role of NATO and the United States.'' And he said the
Czechoslovak president agreed on a need for NATO and U.S. forces
until ``new security structures emerge in Europe.''
   Bush said NATO perhaps should have a broader role than at
present, Seitz said.
   Moreover, the official said Bush told Havel ``he did not
envisage the U.S. presence going on forever and ever and ever and
ever. ... It was contingent on the U.S. presence being centrally
welcomed in Europe and that if the United States were no longer
welcomed in Europe, the U.S. forces would come home, forthwith,
right away, last one out, turn out the lights.''
   Havel told Bush he expects Soviet troops to be withdrawn from
his country ``on a pretty prompt timetable.''
   Discussing the turmoil in the Soviet Union, Havel told Bush ``it
was important that the Soviet Union not experience ... political
earthquakes.''
   Havel said that the ``difficulties plaguing the Soviet Union
almost inevitably would have ... should things go sour, almost
inevitably have an impact on Eastern Europe, indeed, on all of
Eastern Europe,'' Seitz said.
   The Czechoslovak president said he has no fears about German
reunification so long as the new country is a democracy. ``I
wouldn't be afraid of a democratic country if it had 100 million
people, but I would be afraid of a totalitarian country with a
million people,'' he said.
   Havel, who arrived in the United States on Monday, will address
a joint session of Congress on Wednesday before traveling to New
York for business, political and cultural meetings. He will return
home Thursday night. Next week, he will make his first visit to
Moscow.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz, long viewed
as a potential leader of the ruling party, resigned Tuesday,
reportedly over differences with the premier and other members of
the government.
   Premier Yildirim Akbulut and Yilmaz made separate statements to
reporters on the resignation but both declined to give a reason.
   Turkish newspapers have reported in recent days that Yilmaz, of
the ruling Motherland Party, was irritated about criticism in the
council of ministers while he was abroad and which had leaked to
the press.
   Yilmaz, 42, has been a member of all the governments of the
ruling Motherland Party since the party, founded by President
Turgut Ozal, came to power in the 1983 general elections that
restored civilian rule.
   He kept his post after Ozal was elected president and in
November Akbulut became premier and formed a new government.
   There has been speculation in the Turkish press that Yilmaz was
preparing to challenge Akbulut for party leadership.
   The resignation came on the eve of a debate in the Parliament on
general foreign policy and Turkey's recent problems in that area.
   The problems have included a flareup of the feud with Greece,
this time over the Moslem Turkish minority in western Thrace;
protests by southern neighbors Syria and Iraq over Turkey's use of
the Euphrates river waters; the problems of the Turkish minority in
Bulgaria; and a resolution pending in the U.S. Senate that accuses
Ottoman Turks of the genocide of Armenians in World War I.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., sponsored the resolution and presented it
Tuesday.
   Turkey is fiercely opposed to the measure and objects to the
term ``genocide'' to describe what happened to the Armenians.
   A demand by Yilmaz that Wednesday's foreign policy debate in the
Parliament be televised nationwide was viewed by Akbulut as an
attempt to upstage him and brought on the Cabinet discussion and
criticism of the foreign minister, newspaper reports quoting
unidentified Cabinet members said.

   Nature's own cancer-causing chemicals that
are an unavoidable part of everything from pot roast to peanuts
represent a greater health danger than pesticides and other
pollutants, a health official warns.
   A new estimate by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
concludes that more than 98 percent of the cancer risk in the diet
results from ordinary foods _ not from additives, poisons or other
man-made contributions to the food chain.
   ``The risk is from natural carcinogens in the diet because they
overwhelm all the others,'' said Dr. Robert J. Scheuplein, director
of the Office of Toxicological Sciences at the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   This does not mean that all food is dangerous or even that
people can do much about the hazard. Instead, Scheuplein's analysis
was intended to focus attention away from what he sees as a largely
bogus health issue _ the hazards of chemical contamination.

   Efforts to predict the effects of global
warming are being hurt by lack of access to 40 years of secret
Soviet and U.S. military data on the north polar ice cap,
scientists said.
   Submarine sonar measurements of the thickness of the ice cap are
crucial to understanding ocean currents underneath the ice cap,
said Michael Schlesinger of Oregon State University.
   Those currents must be understood if researchers are to predict
accurately the rate of warming of the earth's climate as carbon
dioxide is released into the atmosphere, Schlesinger said Monday at
the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science.
   ``What I want is, month by month, the thickness of sea ice _
which you can only get by submarine,'' Schlesinger said.

   At least 80 farming operations were paid more
than the limit of $100,000 set by Congress under 1988 drought aid
legislation, according to Agriculture Department records.
   The payment list of top recipients under the Disaster Assistance
Act of 1988 was compiled by the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Congress provided $3.9 billion in aid, mostly to help with crop
losses suffered in the 1988 drought. As of Dec. 31, payments of
more than $3.88 billion had been made to 805,152 recipients.
   Agency officials said the list of top payments was sent to the
Office of Management and Budget, which has been reviewing large
payments to farmers under various commodity and emergency programs.

   A chunk of Cold War history is heading into
oblivion. East German border guards are dismantling the crumbling
Berlin Wall between the prewar parliament building and the
Checkpoint Charlie border crossing.
   An East German army crane started removing the pieces of the
wall late Monday, beginning near the majestic Brandenburg Gate, the
best known landmark along the stretch in the heart of Berlin.
   But not all the obstacles will vanish that quickly.
   On Monday, Hans Modrow, East Germany's Communist premier, told
opposition leaders he would not go ``on his knees'' for interim aid
from West Germany.

   Today is Saturday, March 3, the 62nd day of 1990. There are 303
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On March 3, 1931, ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' officially became
the national anthem of the United States.
   On this date:
   In 1845, Florida became the 27th state.
   In 1847, the inventor of the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell,
was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.
   In 1849, the Home Department, forerunner of the Interior
Department, was established.
   In 1875, Georges Bizet's opera ``Carmen'' premiered in Paris.
   In 1879, Belva Ann Bennett Lockwood became the first woman to be
admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In 1885, the U.S. Post Office began offering special delivery
for first-class mail.
   In 1887, Anne Mansfield Sullivan arrived at the Alabama home of
Capt. and Mrs. Arthur H. Keller to become the teacher of their
blind and deaf 6-year-old daughter, Helen.
   In 1918, Germany, Austria and Russia signed the Treaty of
Brest-Litovsk, which ended Russian participation in World War I.
(This treaty was annulled by the November 1918 armistice.)
   In 1940, 50 years ago, Artie Shaw and his orchestra recorded
``Frenesi,'' by Alberto Dominguez, Ray Charles and S.K. Russell,
for RCA Victor.
   In 1969, Apollo 9 blasted off from Cape Kennedy on a mission to
test the lunar module.
   In 1974, nearly 350 people died in one of aviation's worst
disasters as a Turkish Airlines DC-10 crashed shortly after takeoff
from Orly Airport in Paris.
   In 1978, the remains of comedian Charles Chaplin were stolen by
extortionists from his grave in Cosier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland. (The
body was recovered near Lake Geneva 11 weeks later.)
   In 1987, comedian Danny Kaye died in Los Angeles at age 74.
   Ten years ago: President Carter issued a statement saying the
U.S. had erred in voting for a U.N. Security Council resolution
that criticized Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
   Five years ago: Coal miners in Britain voted to end a year-long
strike that proved to be the longest and most violent walkout in
British history.
   One year ago: Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole suggested that
Defense Secretary-designate John Tower be given the opportunity to
appear before the Senate to answer allegations against him.
   Today's birthdays: Actor James Doohan is 70. Singer Enzo Stuarti
is 65. Lee Radziwill Ross is 57. Actor Ed Marinaro is 40. Olympic
track and field medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee is 28. Football
player Herschel Walker is 28.
   Thought for today: ``The meaning of things lies not in the
things themselves but in our attitude towards them.'' _ Antoine de
Saint-Exupery, French author and aviator (1900-1944).

   If ``gay television characters'' turns up as
a category on ``Jeopardy,'' David Gadberry is ready.
   ``Steven Carrington was a gay character, a bisexual character,
then a gay character, then a straight character,'' Gadberry says of
the member of the ``Dynasty'' clan.
   ``Jody on `Soap' was flamboyant and considering a sex change
operation, and from there he became a gay character to a bisexual
character to a straight character,'' he says.
   But Gadberry, 29, is not on a trivial pursuit. He wants to
change how television handles gays, to a Steven Carrington who
stays gay and gay couples included in scripts as regular characters.
   ``For some reason, I don't know why, the industry seems to be a
lot on the homophobic side,'' Gadberry said.
   With no hope of seeing his plans on network television any time
soon, Gadberry pinched his bank account and tapped local gay
businesses for help to produce a one-hour pilot called ``Secret
Passions,'' billed as a gay soap opera.
   Among the characters are a black lesbian city council candidate,
a ``gay J.R. Ewing'' Orange County land developer, a gay male
couple _ Gadberry is one side of that relationship _ and a gay
female couple, a rock singer and her manager.
   There's also the conservative, crusading Rev. Arthur Dimsdale,
whose name is only one consonant away from the agonized Puritan
minister of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ``The Scarlet Letter.''
   ``We have two men in bed, we have kissing, but we're more
suggestive than explicit,'' said Gadberry of the show's content.
It's produced by his Golden West Productions, Inc. _ located in, of
all places, conservative Orange County.
   The $12,000 pilot has been shipped to at least 19 markets for
public access cable shows, the fringe of the market through which
Gadberry hopes to make his way to the middle. Among the cities
where viewers can catch the show are New York, Los Angeles,
Cincinnati, Chicago, St. Louis, Houston, San Francisco, Nashville
and Seattle.
   Gadberry, who's made a media blitz with talk show appearances
and interviews, will appear on ``Donahue'' next week from Los
Angeles.
   His critics have called him a publicity-hungry vendor pushing a
bad show.
   ``We don't think it's a threat,'' said Steve Sheldon of the
conservative Traditional Values Coalition, also based in Orange
County. ``I think it's interesting that they spend more time on
public relations than production. But it's clear the intention of
the soap opera is to change values through the media.''
   Agreed, says Gadberry, an Orange County native who attended
Golden West College, a two-year school, and lives with his parents.
Suffering from the flu he picked up while in New York for a talk
show, he gave a recent interview at home encased in a plaid
bathrobe.
   Gadberry said Sheldon is nonchalant because ``we're in a
position where he can't do anything. They might want to boycott us,
but we don't have any sponsors.''
   He conceded that fellow gays also have questioned the quality
and direction of ``Secret Passions'' after viewing its first, and
only, episode. Gadberry is currently seeking funding for additional
episodes.
   ``We are going to present some of the stereotypes,'' he said.
``And then gradually we are going to knock down the stereotypes and
present the real person.''
   Gadberry wants to move from public access channels to cable
programming, agreeing with others that network television is not
ready for his characters or story lines, from him or any other
source.
   When ``thirtysomething'' showed its homosexual character Russell
in bed with another man last November, the show lost about $1.5
million in advertising, according to reports.
   Officials from NBC, CBS and ABC all declined to comment about
the prospects of gay couples on network television.
   ``I don't think we're going to see anything like this on the
three main broadcast networks anytime soon,'' said Larry Gerbrandt,
a television programming analyst with Paul Kagan Associates.
   What Gadberry has on his side are time, cable's
``narrowcasting'' capabilities and the lure of advertising.
   A demographic analysis by Simmons Market Research Bureau,
Rivendell Marketing Co. showed gay individuals' incomes average
about $36,800, while gay households average $55,400 against the
U.S. average of $36,500.
   Nearly 60 percent are college educated and 49 percent hold
professional and managerial positions, the analysis showed.
   Gadberry has established a ``900'' number for those seeking
broadcast times for ``Secret Passions,'' and says inquiries have
come from around the country. ``Right there, that tells me that
there's a market, that the American public is at least curious,''
he said.

   An exodus from Ireland over the past decade has
left tens of thousands of Irish men and women in the United States
without legal status. While most of the illegals congregate in
cities such as Boston and New York, an underground railway of
priests, nuns, pub keepers and others is helping them find refuge
all across the country.

   Call them the illegal Irish, the undocumented
Irish, the out-of-status Irish or the just plain new Irish.
   But call them if there's a job or an apartment available, begs
Sister Veronica Dobson, who came here 30 years ago from County
Carlow to work among Mexicans crossing the border into Texas and
now runs an outreach program for Irish immigrants in Boston.
   ``And please call,'' she adds, ``if there's a stick of furniture
available'' for them to start a new life.
   Nobody knows for sure how many Irish between the ages of 17 and
30 have unlawfully overstayed their visas in the United States in
the past eight or nine years since the Irish economy went sour.
Estimates range from 60,000 to 150,000. They live haunted by the
fear, often exaggerated but real enough, of being turned over to
immigration authorities.
   But they're not always unwelcome.
   ``They're handy at carpentry and bricklaying so landlords and
the neighbors like having them around,'' says the Rev. Gerard
Burns, whose bishop in Galway sent him to the Dorchester section of
Boston with the ``rather vague assignment of visiting the bars, the
hurling grounds and dance halls'' to minister to a runaway Irish
flock.
   As it was in the flight from the potato famine nearly a century
and a half ago, Boston or New York is their first safe harbor, but
an underground railway of priests, nuns, pub keepers, lawyers, even
congressmen and aldermen, is helping them find refuge in ports of
call from Galveston, Texas, to San Francisco.
   A congressman from Boston's Dorchester section, Brian Donnelly,
D-Mass., has become a household word in Ireland _ ``as well-known
as the pope or John F. Kennedy,'' says Irish Consul General Liam
Canniffe _ for sponsoring the Donnelly visa that since 1986 has
helped thousands immigrate from 36 mostly European countries. Of
the 15,000 Donnelly visas granted last year on a lottery basis,
Ireland won an astounding 12,000.
   Last St. Patrick's Day, 900 Irish men and women seeking legal
status attended a visa clinic in Dorchester, and hundreds more
lined up for applications at a ballroom in New York City's Woodside
area, another haven for the new Irish.
   The exodus of young people in the past decade has so depopulated
parts of western Ireland, where the unemployment rate is nearly 50
percent, that parish priests in rural Mayo and Galway ``can't put
together a dance,'' as Burns puts it. The Gaelic football team in
Waterville disbanded for lack of a 15-man starting lineup.
   Meanwhile, bars like Cuchulainns, the Emerald Isle and the
Blarney Stone on Dorchester Avenue and hundreds more from Boston to
Baltimore, import bands such as ``The Dingle Spike'' and ``T.F.
Much'' from Ireland for the packed weekend dances. ``Many Young Men
of 20 Said Goodbye,'' the theme song of the new wave of
immigration, dampens many an eye.
   ``The newcomers gave the kiss of life to Gaelic games in this
country,'' avows the Rev. Martin Keaveny, who was the first priest
sent over by the Irish bishops to work as a chaplain among the
illegals at the urging of Cardinal John O'Connor. Making the rounds
of their homes, playing fields and bars along ``the Irish mile'' in
the Bainbridge section of the Bronx in New York, he often runs into
young people from his parish back in Mayo.
   Monday night, when video tapes of Sunday's hurling and football
matches are flown in from Ireland, is prime time for pastoral pub
crawling.
   ``The big provincial championships and All-Ireland finals are
brought in live by satellite at 20 (dollars) a ticket,'' Keaveny
says. ``Sports and the church are the two anchors linking them to
home.''
   ``I could sit all day in St. Ambrose's rectory across the street
and no one would call,'' says Burns, sitting at a back table at
Cuchulainns near a poster announcing ``Irish daily and provincial
newspapers on sale every Tuesday'' and a bulletin board papered
with pleas for jobs and apartments. ``You got to go where the
people are.''
   ``And the bar is where they are,'' agrees innkeeper Kieran
Staunton, a legal immigrant from Mayo. ``The bar is their bank,
their employment agency, their apartment finder, their social club,
as well as the cure for loneliness.''
   The ``undocumented Irish,'' as he prefers to call them, are
reluctant to open bank accounts for fear of having their bogus
Social Security numbers exposed and their funds confiscated by the
authorities.
   ``They pay cash for everything, even tools or a used truck
needed on the job. They can't go into business for themselves
without a credit rating,'' Staunton says. ``There's no building a
future not knowing from one day to the next if you'll be deported.
They can't even join a union, which is shocking when you consider
that the secret organizations like the Molly Maguires built the
union movement in this country.''

   A century and a half ago Irish laborers digging canals, laying
railroad tracks and working in the coal fields banded together in
secret societies for protection against ruthless contractors who
underpaid and overworked them in hazardous conditions and often
absconded with the payroll.
   Undocumented aliens are not eligible for food stamps, Medicare
or other federal programs.
   ``Very few apply for relief,'' says Sister Veronica. ``They're
here to succeed. Going from the Irish dole to the welfare rolls
here would be an admission of defeat, a blow to their pride.''
   Thanks to a national education system that makes higher
education available to anyone qualified, this generation is the
best educated in Ireland's history and has the world's highest rate
of computer literacy.
   ``Computer training comes early in our education scheme,''
explains consul Canniffe. ``Wang, Digital and most of the major
software and hardware firms have plants in Ireland.''
   The new Irish compete with an even larger influx of Asians and
Central Americans for jobs that have become much scarcer since the
1986 immigration reform act made employers liable for stiff fines
for hiring illegals.
   With Irish income taxes and health taxes that can eat up 65
percent of a paycheck, architects and engineers can make more here
as construction workers. ``Or behind the counter in a Jewish
deli,'' says Burns. ``And girls with the highest accounting skills
find themselves six or seven years later still minding children or
looking after old people.''
   Like their forebears, many work longer hours for less pay,
without vacation or retirement benefits and no compensation if hurt
on the job. They fall prey to greedy landlords, loan sharks and
unscrupulous immigration lawyers.
   ``These shysters ask a down payment of $1,000 and promise a
green card in two years,'' Staunton says. ``Four years later you're
still paying and no green card in sight.''
   The priest and the publican swapped other recent examples of
exploitation: a maid held in virtual slavery by a Detroit couple
who had confiscated her passport; a New Hampshire woman who
advertised in Irish newspapers for domestics at $200 a week, but
paid two girls who came out only $50 a week until they worked off
their air fare. All were hesitant to go to the police.
   Timothy Whelan, deputy district director of the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service in Boston, regrets that ``despite the
immigration reform act, some employers still resort to
under-the-table deals, accepting fraudulent documents that wouldn't
fool anybody else.''
   His agents recently moved in on a South Shore nursing home
operator who hired 11 illegals as orderlies and nursing aides
through ads in the Dublin papers promising green cards.
   ``For openers, we confiscated his Mercedes-Benz,'' says Whelan,
who is reconciled to being regarded as ``something of a villain''
by the Irish.
   ``But I have a responsibility under the law, and I'm not
insensitive to their plight. My father came from Cork. I made a
trip there last year. I play the bagpipes. Tears come to my eyes
when I hear the Clancy Brothers sing `Four Green Fields.'
   ``Sure, we nab three or four now and then, but I don't wear my
black hat all the time. We could raid those Irish bars every
weekend and pick them up by the hundreds, but we have more
important priorities. Aliens involved in criminal activities, like
the drug traffic, keep us plenty busy.''
   Canniffe is relieved that so far Irish illegals ``haven't
contributed much to crime in Boston. But I don't like to see them
getting involved in under-the-table jobs. Living on the margin of
society, outside the law, is very dangerous. Most want to be
honest, but if they find themselves treated as outlaws they might
be induced into more serious illegal activities.''
   Burns also sees the danger: ``To be out of work in Ireland is no
disgrace. To be out of work in Boston is devastating. They come
here figuring things couldn't be any worse and don't know what
they're getting into. In Ireland you never worry about getting sick
or growing old. Here they worry about paying to send the kids to
parochial school.''
   Most of the new arrivals look upon Boston, New York, Chicago or
wherever as a refueling stop on the road to a better life.
   `The pull for home is very strong with them,'' says Sister
Veronica. ``They plan to put a little something aside for a house
and a car, and go home someday.''
   ``Home, home,'' says tavern keeper Staunton with just the trace
of a jeer and a sigh. ``That's all they ever talk about around
here. Some are here up to eight years and still dreaming about
going home. It's only a 7-hour jet ride, but I know of several who
wouldn't go back for their mother's funeral for fear of not getting
back in here.''

   Irish athletes are being recruited with the promise of a job as
the popularity of hurling and other Gaelic sports grows in this
country, immigration officials say.
   ``The new wave of Irish immigration has brought new life to
Gaelic games in this country,'' says Frank Costello, immigration
adviser to Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and an ardent hurling fan.
   He says top young players are being recruited in Ireland with
promises of jobs. He tells of ``an entire village football squad
arriving from County Clare.''
   New York's Gaelic Athletic Association, according to past
president Terry Connaughton, now boasts 55 football teams, 16
hurling clubs and two camogie teams, a field sport for women.
   Sunday matches at Gaelic Park in New York City draw crowds of
4,000.
   A few seasons ago, two illegals, working as carpenters in the
Bronx, nipped home to help Galway defeat Kilkenny in the All
Ireland hurling championship, the Auld Sod's equivalent of the
Super Bowl.

   A new wave of Irish immigrants is getting help
from both government agencies and private groups, regardless of
their legal status.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn has extended city health and legal services
to all immigrants, whether they have green cards or not, and a
police department memo pledges full assistance to aliens who have
been exploited or are crime victims without fear of their being
turned over to immigration authorities.
   The Irish Voice, a New York-based newspaper, runs a weekly
``Green Card'' advice column.
   The Irish Immigration Reform Movement, an advocacy group, is
pushing for amnesty for Irish illegals and backing a new bill that
would make 75,000 more visas available over the next five years.
   Dr. Barry Woods, a graduate of Galway University, has organized
a support group of Boston physicians. Sister Ann Ferry, a
Franciscan nun, works as an immigration attorney.
   Flynn also is a founder of Boston-Ireland Ventures, a non-profit
organization attacking the problem at the source by promoting
economic development in Ireland. The group has financed forestry
development in western Ireland and recently launched a $100 million
shopping center in Derry expected to create 1,400 jobs.
   The Irish-American Partnership, another non-profit group
dedicated to improving Ireland's economy, is generating 200 jobs by
restoring a seaport on Tralee Bay in Ireland.
   Partnership president Joseph Leary Jr. reports that modernizing
a sock factory in Belfast brought about the ``hiring of nine young
people who never had jobs before and whose fathers never had jobs.''

   While the Irish economy is improving, officials
predict that a migration of young people from the country will
continue throughout the 1990s.
   Liam Canniffe, the Irish consul general in Boston and a trained
economist, says, ``The exodus of our young people to England,
Australia, Canada and the United States will continue at least
until the year 2000.
   ``It's a matter of demographics. Half our population in under 27
years old. We need to provide 30,000 jobs a year to keep them at
home. Even if we had a phenomenal growth like Taiwan or Korea, we
couldn't do it. This year we'll get 18,000 of those needed jobs, so
the amount having to go abroad will be dramatically reduced, but
the problem won't go away.''
   Meanwhile, unemployment is down in Ireland from 27 percent to 16
percent and inflation has been cut to 2.1 percent, the lowest in 25
years.

   The disintegration of the Iron Curtain in Europe
has brought the reunion of families divided for decades. Refugees
who managed to reach the West are returning to their homeland to
find their relatives who were not so lucky. One who went home
recently was AP Correspondent Denis D. Gray. This is his story.

<TEXT>
   Nearly four decades after fleeing
my homeland as a little boy, I walked past the house where I was
born, past the 15th century cathedral where generations of my
family were married. At the end of an avenue dusted by morning
snow, I rang a doorbell.
   A lady with white hair appeared. For a few moments we looked at
each other silently, then fell into a long embrace. ``Zdenku,
Zdenku,'' Aunt Vlasta sobbed. ``We knew you would come back one
day. We knew you would come home.''
   Thirty-nine years ago I had leaped off a moving train into the
darkness and run through frontier forests that gave cover to
thousands of us _ refugees fleeing the Stalinist gloom into which
Eastern Europe was receding.
   I knew nothing about communism or the Iron Curtain and little of
what we _myself, my mother, younger sister and our guide _ were
doing that summer night in 1951.
   But filtered through a child's sensitivity, the forest rustle
became a sinister pursuer. And with the dawn _ caught exposed in a
wheat field _ came palpable terror: Our mysterious guide was
grappling with a border guard and all of us were running, running .
..
   We survived, crossing the Czech-Austrian border and finally
being smuggled into that great refugee haven of the Cold War: the
sector of Vienna occupied by American forces.
   Ahead was a joyful reunion with my father, who had been forced
to flee a year earlier, and decades of freedom for me and family.
We severed our links to the past, gave up traditions, property,
friendships, and even our Czech names.
   The country and relatives we left behind went through the iron
rule of the 1950s, the dashed hopes of the 1968 Prague Spring, and
then last year's bloodless uprising, which allowed me to
re-establish ties without fear that my relatives would be
jeopardized.
   On the afternoon of my return, Uncle Slava called my father in
California. The two brothers _ very close as boys and young men _
had not talked to each other since 1950 when my father, a rising
young politician vocally opposed to communist rule, was warned of
his impending arrest and managed to flee with the help of a Roman
Catholic priest.
   That evening, uncle and aunt, cousins and their children _ three
generations that ideology had separated from me _ talked and
talked. We planned the coming days together and brought out bottles
of the slightly bitter beer for which Pilsen is renowned.
   ``To a new, better Czechoslovakia,'' we toasted.
   ``What happened last year, our `Velvet Revolution,' was
indescribably wonderful, although I won't live long enough to enjoy
its fruits,'' my 76-year-old uncle said. ``But perhaps my children
or grandchildren will.''
   Two of the grandchildren _ lovely and lanky Petra and Michaela _
proudly told how they organized protests and traveled to factories
and farms to explain democratic demands. Petra, a molecular biology
student at Prague's Charles University, had donned a Santa Claus
outfit to deliver sacks of coal and potatoes to the doors of
communist leaders to mock and rattle the fallen order.
   While both talked of job opportunities and perhaps scholarships
in the West, the stories of my uncle and aunt sadly showed that
they and their generation could have made far more of their lives
and abilities.
   Well-educated and capable, Slava was running factories and other
businesses owned by his in-laws before the 1948 communist takeover.
Then all the businesses were summarily nationalized without
compensation and Slava spent seven years in forests chopping down
trees.

   During the Stalinist era, many people in Pilsen disappeared.
Others, less lucky than ourselves, were shot or captured trying to
breach the Iron Curtain. Slava was shadowed, threatened and
interrogated about my father by the STB, the dreaded secret police
that was recently abolished.
   In the 1960s, while I was attending Yale University and my
father was succeeding as an executive at IBM in Paris and New York,
Slava was employed as an administrator at an institute of physical
education. Eva, one of his daughters with whom I played as a child,
was refused admission to the college of her choice because of her
``bourgeois-capitalist background.''
   Slava retained his dignity and a sense of humor. But like most
Czechs, Eva told me, her father made his compromises with a system
he privately detested but felt incapable of changing. He kept a low
profile and avoided the ideologues. He focused his life on his
family's happiness and as much economic well-being as was possible.
   The Prague Spring brought momentary hope to my relatives, as it
did to millions of Czechs. They began exploratory contact through
letters to an aunt. Then the Soviet tanks came.
   ``Good day,'' my uncle greeted a passerby as we strolled
together through Pilsen. ``Your father knew that man,'' he says to
me. ``He was Pilsen's master tailor. In 1968 he took out an old
American flag and flew it. For that he was made a furnace stoker.
It happened to many.''
   We walked through the streets and main square of the inner city,
my uncle convincing me that my vague remembrance of Old World charm
was not mere nostalgia. But grime now coated once stately
residences and even historic buildings were dilapidated behind
painted facades. Slava pointed to the scaffolding around the city's
symbol _ the cathedral tower.
   ``For each of the past six years, newspapers wrote that the
tower would be repaired by year's end,'' he said with a wry smile.
``But in this great worker's state they couldn't even organize the
clearing of the meter-thick layer of pigeon droppings in the
belfry.''
   ``The past 41 years have been an endless parade of stupidities;
the state robbed the people and the people tried to rob the
state,'' my uncle said. ``Work and ability didn't matter. More
important was turning up for the May 1 parade.''
   Eva, sensitive and perceptive, described people as sleepwalking
through the work week; speaking one way and thinking another, even
avoiding friendships for fear of betrayal.
   ``We withdrew into ourselves and our families. We longed for the
Saturdays and Sundays,'' she said. ``Now let's hope that we can
look beyond and treat one another with more kindness ....''
   Before I left the city of my birth, I had a private reunion with
someone I had missed most over the years, perhaps because I never
got to know the full man, and because boys make idols of their
grandfathers.
   His grave lay on the crest of a hill, watched over by pale
birches and barren oaks bending to an icy wind. Patches of snow and
flowers withered by winter covered the raised earth.
   ``It just can't go on like this. The communists are bound to
crack soon,'' my uncle said grandfather told him before he died in
1965, full of hope until the end.
   In his youth, grandfather had dreamed of a Czechoslovakia
independent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, so he deserted the
emperor's army. Alongside the Allies, he fought at Verdun and other
murderous battlefields of World War I.
   Independence was won, but the communists would take away
grandfather's property, his basic freedoms and, in a sense, half
his family. His son, my father, stood up bravely until hopeless
odds drove him into exile.
   Now a third generation of our family is trying for a more decent
Czech way, with Michaela marching on the streets of Prague and
Petra playing Santa Claus to thumb his nose at the old communist
leaders.

   It's perhaps the most famous promenade in the
world, the Champs Elysees, the once-elegant avenue that was the
epitome of Paris. But the schlock of urban living is spoiling the
vista today, the grande dame of avenues has become a bit tacky.
It's time for a new dress, some Paris leaders say, and already the
designers are at work.

   Thomas Jefferson would have been aghast to see the
garish billboards, the hamburger joints and the street vendors
lining the Champs Elysees.
   Charles Dickens, no stranger to the seamier side of London,
would have been taken aback at the sight of deformed beggars
selling pencils to leather-jacketed youths along the famed avenue,
which he favored for its country flavor.
   And Napoleon, the embodiment of the grandeur of France, might
have been enraged to see a ragged, toothless fire-eater cavorting
in the shadow of his majestic Arc de Triomphe.
   Indeed, these and other former habitues of the Champs Elysees,
once the most beautiful avenue in the world, would wonder what in
the world has happened to the old neighborhood.
   It's hardly the Champs Elysees of legend, a magical haven of
luxury and leisure, fabled in song and fiction and celebrated on
the silver screen, offering a breathtaking vista sweeping from the
Place de la Concorde to the triumphal arch commemorating Napoleon's
victories.
   But thanks to an ambitious project unveiled in January by city
officials, the Champs Elysees will get a badly needed face lift, a
chance to reverse its decline into mediocrity.
   Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, lived on the Champs
Elysees while he was ambassador to France from 1785 to '89. So did
Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens, who disdained the headiness of
Left Bank literary society for the quiet of the Champs.
   Marcel Proust played in the gardens at the Rond Point, and after
World War II Dwight D. Eisenhower directed the Allied Forces
operations from his headquarters overlooking the Champs, as the
avenue is known for short.
   They would hardly recognize the Champs today, with its
bumper-to-bumper traffic and oversized sidewalk cafes that force
pedestrians onto the road.
   ``The Champs Elysees should once again become the privileged
place for promenades it was designed to be ... and once again
become the most beautiful avenue in the world,'' Mayor Jacques
Chirac told reporters.
   The plan, expected to cost from $26 million to $36 million and
take four years to complete, calls for eliminating the car-jammed
side alleys running parallel to the main street, which is 6,266
feet long.
   In their place, sidewalks will be widened to 70 feet and paved
with multihued granite slabs laid out in geometrical designs. Two
new underground parking garages will replace the 390 spaces lost.
   The piece de resistance will be a second row of more than 300
plane trees to be staggered several feet behind the existing lane,
thus reinforcing the luxuriance of the 233-foot-wide avenue.
   The brainchild of Pierre-Yves Ligen, a veteran urban planner
whose accomplishments include overseeing the revamping of the
Louvre Museum in the mid-1980s, the overhaul also will target the
giant billboards hanging on buildings along the Champs.
   ``There's no reason why the world's most beautiful avenue should
be used like a Christmas tree with any old thing hanging on it,''
Ligen says. Under his plan, billboards will be allowed only on
ground and first floors.
   Fast-food restaurants, with their brightly colored logos
familiar worldwide, also will have to tone down their decor.
   Some cafes and restaurants may have to reduce or even eliminate
their sidewalk terraces.
   ``Pedestrians shouldn't have to step over subway vents just
because a terrace has taken over half the sidewalk,'' Ligen says.
   And in the hope of luring back high-class hotels, the stone
facades of several large buildings will be classified as historical
monuments.
   A similar maneuver saved Fouquet's, the legendary Champs Elysees
restaurant and bar that has catered to the world's film industry
for generations and is one of the few remaining establishments
serving up traditional fare in a comfortable setting.
   But to Roland Pozzo di Borgo, president of the Champs Elysees
Committee, which represents 200 store owners and managers, the
avenue is fine just the way it is.
   ``The Champs is simply evolving along with the new lifestyle and
needs of those who frequent it _ 300,000 people daily according to
police officials,'' he says.
   Those strollers enjoy the varied non-stop street life, a choice
among about two dozen first-run movies, 24-hour kiosks selling
newspapers and magazines from around the world, a giant music
store, and competing auto showrooms serving hamburgers and banana
splits.
   Though Pozzo di Borgo supports the mayor's plan, he says his
group worries that prolonged construction will hurt business.
   His biggest headaches, he says, are the many vagrants and street
vendors illegally hawking everything from giant balloons to roasted
chestnuts, and who flock back to the Champs despite repeated police
raids.
   Despite the crowds, the Champs Elysees is one of the safest
areas in Paris, police say.
   For the vendors, it is also one of the most lucrative. Pozzi di
Borgo claims a choice location on the Champs costs each vendor
between $1,700 and $2,600 paid to an underground organization that
furnishes the goods, posts lookouts and collects the profits.
   Many blame the decline of the Champs Elysees on skyrocketing
rents and the RER, the regional express transit line that links
eastern and western suburbs and has a major stop at Etoile, under
the Arc de Triomphe.
   ``The RER has brought in a young, suburban population on a beer
budget,'' says Andre Parinaud, secretary general of the
organization Remontons les Champs Elysees (Up the Champs Elysees).
``The stores offer what they can afford _ beer, records and
sandwiches.''
   The only fur-clad visitors, he says, are the foreign tourists
taking in some of the glamour at the Lido nightclub, one of the few
surviving Champs Elysees institutions.
   Parinaud accused Pozzo di Borgo's group of being ``too concerned
with short-term profits.''
   ``Cultural values are more important than economic ones,'' he
says. His group is urging a ``cultural renaissance'' with more
theaters, a cultural center and no more hamburger joints and pizza
parlors.
   Laid out in 1667 by Jean-Baptise Colbert, finance minister under
Louis XIV, the Champs Elysees was designed to extend the sightline
of the Tuileries palace _ since destroyed by fire _ and surround it
with wide, tree-lined walkways that the king could admire from the
salon of his royal residence at the Louvre.

   Ever since it was landscaped by Jean-Baptiste
Colbert in 1667, the Champs Elysees has provided a dramatic setting
for some of the nation's most emotional events:
   1792 _ The statue of King Louis XV at the foot of the Champs
Elysees was toppled and the site was renamed Square of the
Revolution.
   1793 _ A guillotine, known as the ``national razor,'' was
erected especially for the beheading of King Louis XVI and later
Queen Marie-Antoinette, Charlotte Corday and other victims of the
Reign of Terror.
   1829 _ A 75-foot obelisk in pink granite and weighing more than
220 tons was erected at what is now called the Place de la Concorde.
   1885 _ Victor Hugo's body lay in state for a night under the Arc
de Triomphe, shrouded in black crepe before the long funeral
procession carrying his body from the Champs to his burial at the
Pantheon.
   1923 _ On Nov. 11, marking the fifth anniversary of the end of
World War I, the flame of remembrance was kindled for the first
time over the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
   1944 _ Gen. Charles de Gaulle, celebrating the liberation of
Paris from German occupation, would describe the moment in his
memoirs as coming face to face with the soul of a nation.

   A powerful symbol of the beauty and grandeur of
France, the Champs Elysees has been celebrated in song, fiction and
on the silver screen by generations of international talent.
   Who could forget the sweet innocence of American actress Jean
Seberg hawking the Paris Herald Tribune on the Champs Elysees in
Jean-Luc Godard's 1959 movie classic ``Breathless,'' co-starring
the young Jean-Paul Belmondo?
   French audiences still wince as German tanks roll down the
Champs Elysees in ``Is Paris Burning?'' (1965), Rene Clement's epic
about the efforts of a German general to save the French capital
from destruction as ordered by Nazi leader Adolph Hitler.
   Dozens of writers lived on or near the tree-shaded avenue.
Marcel Proust used to play in the gardens at the Rond Point where
he met the young woman who would later inspire his two most
mememorable female characters, Gilberte and Odette of ``Remembrance
of Things Past.''
   Gustave Flaubert was fascinated with the Champs Elysees and the
role it played in the social lives of fashionable Parisians. In the
novel ``The Sentimental Education,'' Frederic makes frequent
pilgrimages there to catch a glimpse of his beloved Madame Arnoux.
   Victor Hugo took up residence on the Champs Elysees after being
evicted from his Left Bank home. He remained there until 1832 when
fighting broke out under his windows, confining the entire family
to the house for days. Soon after he moved to a ``safer'' home on
the Place des Vosges.
   British novelist Charles Dickens, seeking the anonymity of a
foreign capital, chose Paris and a home on the Champs Elysees. But
after the publication of ``Martin Chuzzlewit'' and its enormous
success, he was recognized even by the French, and finally agreed
to give weekly public readings of the book _ in English.
   Honore de Balzac's ``The Human Comedy'' contains 41 references
to the Champs Elysees. In his classic ``Father Goriot,'' the Champs
is where the miserly old man wanders, secretly admiring handsome
young ladies in horse-drawn carriages.
   Stendhal summed up the Champs of old. ``I'm going to look for
the peace and quiet of the country in the only place where it
exists in France, on a fourth floor overlooking the Champs
Elysees.''
   Joe Dassin's hit tune of the 1960s summed up the story of the
Champs today: ``In sun and rain, at noon or midnight, you can get
anything you want on the Champs Elysees.''

   Protecting the Champs Elysees is not a new theme.
   In his book ``Champs Elysees 1789-1989,'' Jean Aillaud recounts
the story of the Hotel Massa, the oldest private home on the Champs.
   ``In 1928, it was slated for demolition to make way for a
multistory business center,'' Aillaud said in an interview. ``But a
group called `Friends of the Champs Elysees' protested so
vigorously, it was taken down stone by stone and rebuilt on the
Left Bank.''
   A host of other private homes and entertainment halls have not
been so lucky, replaced by airline offices, automobile showrooms,
banks and movie theaters, many of which are threatened today by
soaring rents.
   The only remaining villa is La Paiva at No. 25, built in 1865
for the legendary Polish courtesan of the same name who maintained
a fashionable literary salon during the 19th century. Famous for
its unique onyx staircase, it has housed the Travelers' Club since
the early 1900s and can be visited by appointment.

   Lured to Bolivia by cheap land prices and
exemptions from military service and public schooling in the 1960s,
colonies of the Mennonite religious sect have prospered in the
South American country, growing cotton and soybeans. But now there
is trouble in paradise. Some of the brethren fell victim to loan
sharks and are now in prison for failure to pay their debts.

<TEXT>
   The world that Abraham Groening and
his Mennonite ancestors fled for 400 years has caught up with him.
   The once-proud farmer, who is 45 years old and has 13 children,
is confined to a squalid local prison because of debts to loan
sharks.
   ``I sold off everything I had, but it wasn't enough,'' he told a
visitor. ``Now I don't even own my own bed. And here I am.''
   A borrower who falls behind on payments can be imprisoned in
Bolivia, where the law equates incurring bad debts with criminal
fraud.
   Six brethren share both Groening's predicament and his cell
block. Hundreds of others have managed to avoid prison but also
were victimized, squeezed after borrowing at exorbitant interest
rates or guaranteeing the loans of others.
   ``They couldn't read the fine print,'' said Menno Ediger, an
overseas volunteer for the Pennsylvania-based Mennonite Central
Committee. ``They aren't well educated. They aren't equipped to
deal with the outside world.''
   Such was the case of Groening. ``I borrowed $4,000, but the debt
grew faster than I could pay it back,'' he said. In two years he
owed $40,000, he said.
   Groening has spent six months in the Santa Cruz jail, and has
yet to have a court hearing. He could receive a sentence of several
years in prison.
   To keep himself busy, he cuts out wooden puzzles by hand with a
jigsaw.
   Some of his fellow prisoners already have been jailed for a year
or more and some have found more worldly ways to pass the time. The
gaunt and dazed expressions of some of the prisoners signal drug
abuse. Use of bazuka, a cheap and often contaminated form of
cocaine, is common among prisoners.
   At the prison, in the tropical brush outside the city, the
Mennonites are painfully surrounded by the trappings of modern life
shunned by their creed.
   Rock music blares from portable stereos. Televisions drone in
the cell blocks and in the fly-infested prison canteen,
broadcasting soccer games and soap operas. Wall posters warn about
the danger of AIDS. There is no prison farm, no work programs.
   The scandal has darkly clouded life in the 16 Mennonite colonies
scattered across the sandy, scrub-covered plains outside Santa
Cruz, in South America's barely tamed Amazonian heartland.
   It is inspiring some believers to move on, continuing a
migration that dates back centuries to the sect's origins.
   The Mennonites arose from among Swiss Anabaptists in the 1530s
and took their name from a Dutch protestant reformist, Menno
Simons. Belief in the Bible, adult baptism and non-resistance are
fundamental, but within the sect currents range from extremely
conservative to liberal.
   Most of those in Bolivia are so-called Old Colony Mennonites,
and resemble the Amish that broke away from the main church 200
years ago. They speak a Low German dialect, dress simply in
overalls or frocks with wide-brimmed straw hats and educate their
many children at home. They reject most modern technology, making
their livings as farmers or craftsmen and riding about in
horse-drawn buggies.
   They try to avoid unnecessary contact with what they call ``The
World.'' They are prohibited from working outside their colony's
borders, and are barred from using rubber tires on their tractors _
it might tempt someone to take a ride into town. Instead, they use
spiked steel wheels unsuitable for pavement.
   Over the centuries, their fundamentalism has forced periodic
migrations, to Russia, Canada and Mexico, among many other
countries.
   They began flowing into Bolivia, mostly from Mexico and Belize,
in the 1960s. About 6,000 to 7,000 came in all. Since then,
sporadic new arrivals and births have swelled their numbers to
about 20,000.
   As in previous migrations, they were attracted to Bolivia by
cheap land and special government exemptions from military service
and public schooling. They also received an exemption from import
duties for farm equipment.
   Many were escaping pressure to culturally conform.
   ``It's always the conservative ones who find the world is
getting too close,'' Ediger says. ``They came here because they
wanted to preserve, or get back to, a way of life threatened by the
advance of technology.''
   A more liberal Mennonite from Canada, Ediger and his wife,
Margaretha, run a modest Santa Cruz cultural center and outreach
program directed at the colonists.

   Ediger is sharply critical of fundamentalism, but confesses a
grudging admiration for the Old Colony adherents' strength and
independence. ``You've got to hand it to them,'' he says. ``They
came here and started from scratch, hacking and burning the brush
and building their homes.''
   Pat Gavagan, a Roman Catholic ex-priest from Britain who farms
land adjacent to a Mennonite colony, called the sect's members
``absolutely brilliant'' at working with their hands.
   ``They're terribly confident they can go anywhere, even the
middle of nowhere, and make a life at farming,'' he says. ``And the
thing is, they can do it.''
   The colonists did not arrive in Bolivia empty-handed. Many
brought seed money, in the form of savings and profits from selling
their land in Mexico or elsewhere. They imported new tractors,
combines and other expensive farm equipment.
   They began quickly turning a profit in the new colonies, first
growing cotton and, nowadays, mostly soybeans in the sandy soil
around Santa Cruz. They now produce about 70 percent of the $5
million in soybeans exported by Bolivia.
   The colonies, with their sturdy brick bungalows, are models of
neatness. Flaxen-haired children and big farm dogs frolic on the
well-tended lawns.
   Their affluence attracted attention _ not all of it good. Their
stores and homes sometimes have been robbed by gunmen who learned
that the Mennonites, because of their pacifism, don't fight back.
   Bankers sought out their business, appreciating the colonists'
reputation for thrift and honesty.
   In the mid-1980s, an economic crisis left most Bolivians with
little cash and less credit. Lenders aggressively sought out the
Mennonites, who also were feeling the squeeze and, for the first
time in Bolivia, were obliged to borrow against their crop.
   ``In 1986, the bankers printed up leaflets that said, `Mr.
Mennonite, Come and Borrow From me,''' Ediger recalls. ``They
spread them around the colonies.''
   In many cases, however, the bankers did not lend the money
themselves. They steered the naive Mennonites to friends who ran
shady loan agencies that offered U.S. dollars at usurious rates _
up to 5 percent or more a month.
   Ediger estimates at least 300 Mennonites were fleeced in the
scheme. In many cases, the colonies are having to use common money,
normally saved for buying land, to pay off the debts.
   Some of the imprisoned Mennonites get visits from relatives, who
must travel for hours by bus on dusty roads from the colonies. But
others have fallen into disgrace, and even their wives and children
now shun them.
   ``They don't come here anymore,'' Enrique Jiesprecht Boll, 43,
said of his wife and five children. ``Other people are telling them
not to come.''
   He has been in the prison 16 months, and has yet to receive a
sentence.
   Some of the prisoners even have been banned, a form of
excommunication in which close contact even with immediate family
members is prohibited. Among those banned was a debtor who became a
trusty, driving the prison truck to town on errands. The
fundamentalist code prohibits driving of automobiles and trucks.
   There are colonists who feel the jailed Mennonites were victims
of their own greed or sloth. ``Some weren't workers,'' says Franz
Rempel, a 39-year-old cabinet maker in a colony called Swift
Current, southeast of Santa Cruz.
   ``When you take out a loan, you have to work to pay it back.
Some didn't know how to do that.''
   According to colonists, the borrowers were naively trying to
repeat the profits that could be made by borrowing pesos in the
early 1980s, when devaluation outpaced interest rates. With
inflation running at five digits, a loan in pesos equivalent to
$1,000 in 1983 could be paid back a year later with the equivalent
of just $75. A government austerity program put an end to high
inflation, and the accompanying financial speculation, in 1985.
   Margaretha Ediger maintains, however, that the indebted
Mennonites have more than paid for any sins. ``Their crimes are
nothing compared to the crimes of those (the lenders) who are
keeping them in prison,'' she says.
   One of the inmates, 28-year-old Abraham Friesen, only days away
from his scheduled release after 18 months' imprisonment, said he
planned to emigrate with his wife and six children.
   ``I'd like to go to another country, maybe Canada,'' he said.
``I had to sell everything. There's nothing left for me here.''

   As many as 1 million American families are
schooling their children at home, often for religious reasons, and
31 states now have laws setting down guidelines for do-it-yourself
education. Here's a look inside a typical home school in Michigan,
where the children start the day with farm chores and mom then
becomes their teacher.

   In the living room of the modest two-story
farmhouse of Peter and Ruth Nobel, five children are gathered
around a piano singing hymns.
   The music signals the start of the school day for Charity, Luke,
Hope, Samuel and Hannah Nobel. It also symbolizes the type of
education their parents want for them.
   ``We try to live a God-centered life,'' Mrs. Nobel says. ``It
seems like the public schools elevate man and his reasoning above
all things, where we consider God's word to be the final
authority.''
   The Nobels, members of an independent Reformed church, consider
public schools to be un-Christian places that do a mediocre job of
educating. They also find a nearby Christian school unacceptable
because of doctrinal differences.
   They are among an estimated 750,000 to 1 million American
families teaching their kids at home, says Chris Klicka, senior
counsel for the Home School Legal Defense Association in Paeoian
Springs, Va. The association offers legal assistance to
home-schoolers for a $100 annual fee.
   Many cite religious reasons for keeping their children out of
public schools and some end up in court, says Klicka, whose group
is involved in more than 30 cases nationwide protesting state
restrictions on home-schoolers.
   ``We're gaining ground,'' he says. ``Thirty-one states have
passed bills permitting schooling at home, and 29 have done so
since 1982.''
   Michigan and Iowa remain the most restrictive states, with laws
requiring certified teachers, Klicka says. Home-schoolers also
object to laws in other states that require such things as teacher
competency tests or college degrees.
   Michigan's law is being challenged in a case pending before the
Michigan Supreme Court and has been altered by previous court
decisions.
   Jean Shane, education consultant for the Michigan Department of
Education, says recent court decisions require the state to give
teaching permits to people with bachelor's degrees, even if they
lack teaching certificates.
   Parents who ask for a permit must report the names of the
children being taught and the curriculum being used, Shane says.
   About 700 filed reports this year, but Klicka says many never
report for fear of being taken to court.
   Mrs. Nobel, a college graduate who won a court ruling allowing
her to teach at home, began teaching her children more than 11
years ago with 22-year-old Abigail and now with 3-year-old Hannah.
   The Nobel children begin their day with chores on the family's
77-acre dairy farm about 25 miles south of Grand Rapids. Then they
gather in the living room at 9 a.m. for hymns while Charity, 17,
accompanies them on the piano.
   The children grab their books and scatter to their separate
study areas on the floors of their bedrooms, at the dining-room
table or in the kitchen.
   ``Unless I have a problem, I don't even go downstairs. I just
work by myself. In a way, that's better,'' says Charity, who does
her schoolwork sitting cross-legged on the floor of her tidy
bedroom.
   Economics, history, biology, government, algebra, English
literature, typing and Bible fill about five hours of her day. The
younger children spend about three hours a day on their studies.
   Downstairs, Mrs. Nobel spends a few minutes with each child.
   Hope, at the dining room table, recites for her mother a portion
of ``The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere'' that the 11-year-old
sixth-grader has memorized. Then she takes a science test.
   Luke, 14, has read a story at a small desk at the end of his bed
and Mrs. Nobel quizzes him about it.
   Then the older children work independently while Mrs. Nobel
helps Samuel, a 7-year-old first-grader, sitting at a small desk in
the kitchen, read a story about Jesus walking on water.
   ``I think that they get the basics,'' says Mrs. Nobel, who has
found herself brushing up on algebra and chemistry to stay ahead of
her students.
   Some of the children's books and worksheets come from the
Christian Liberty Academy in Arlington Heights, Ill., a private
school that also operates a correspondence school for parents who
teach their children at home.
   The children follow a school year similar to a traditional
school. They get report cards four times a year and take
standardized achievement tests used by many traditional schools.
   On a recent round of tests, their scores were at or above grade
level in all areas.
   ``They aren't being compared with other children their age,''
says Mrs. Nobel, who has taught as many as seven children at once.
``They move at their pace and aren't really that much aware that
they are behind or ahead of others.''
   One daughter is attending Calvin College in Grand Rapids and
another graduated as a registered nurse. Mrs. Nobel says they were
as well prepared as their classmates.
   ``There were a few things they had to catch up on, such as
science laboratory work, but it was by no means impossible,'' she
says.
   The children's studies are supplemented by trips to the library,
occasional field trips with other home-schooling families, softball
games and volleyball matches.
   Mrs. Nobel, who taught briefly in a Christian school, says a
teaching certificate is no guarantee of a teacher's ability.
   But Mary Anne Adams, consultant in the Michigan Education
Association's professional development department, says teachers
without certificates may lack knowledge of how children learn and
what should be taught.
   Children taught entirely at home also may lag in social
development because they have fewer opportunities to mix with
others their own age, Adams says.
   ``That whole socialization process is important.''

   When Roberto Athayde wrote the play ``Miss
Margarida's Way'' in Brazil 19 years ago, it was forbidden to
criticize government figures. So he wrote about a schoolteacher.
   Athayde says audiences immediately identified his schoolteacher
as the general who was then Brazil's dictator.
   Now, dictators are falling. But, the author says, the message of
``Miss Margarida's Way'' is that they can also rise, and people
allow it to happen.
   Estelle Parsons, who is back in the role of Miss Margarida for
its current revival on Broadway, agrees.
   ``Roberto said when he wrote it he wanted to show Miss Margarida
had a tremendous amount of appeal. People have to love dictators
and perpetuate them and keep them going. People are always saying,
`How could this happen?' I thought, `This is how it happens.'''
   Onstage at the Helen Hayes Theater, Parsons as Miss Margarida
berates her eighth-grade class _ the audience. If somebody comes in
late, she demands that they come to the stage and apologize. They
do.
   She postures, seduces, fascinates. She demands obedience,
punishes offenders and rants insanely. There's no army backing her
up, but she's in control.
   Parsons, who likes substance in the work she does, first played
Miss Margarida at the off-Broadway Public Theater and then on
Broadway in 1977. Since then, she has played the role across the
United States and in England, Ireland, Australia and Turkey.
   The revival on Broadway opened on Feb. 15 for a six-week run.
   ``It is really a classic,'' she says. ``It always works.''
   Parsons, whose college degree is in political science, began her
show business career here as a singer in such vehicles as Julius
Monk's revues at the Upstairs at the Downstairs. She began acting
in a search for substance.
   The change in the audience response to ``Miss Margarida'' since
1977 troubles Parsons.
   ``It is scary to me that people are more passive now, more
willing to take it,'' she says. ``I had someone come up and confess
to something. I stood him in the corner facing the wall, wearing a
dunce cap, and he missed the whole second act. That's the first
time anyone has done that. They've fidgeted around, the cap has
fallen off and they've gone back to their seat.
   ``There's a part where I say everybody has to sing. They always
sing. They never used to sing before. They do what I tell them.
That's rather frightening, isn't it? We're heading toward
addlebrained leaders, machines talking to us, people wanting to be
led. Our confidence as individuals is getting less and less and
less.''
   Parsons won an Academy Award as best supporting actress as
Blanche in ``Bonnie and Clyde.'' She plays Tess Trueheart's mother
in ``Dick Tracy,'' coming out in June. She currently plays Roseanne
Barr's TV mother, occasionally, on ``Roseanne.''
   She has no regrets about not pursuing a film or TV career. ``I
could never do that steadily,'' she says. ``It's not profoundly
interesting to me. And I have no interest in money. I don't have
any material desires. I love to have real crises for two hours
where you get to entertain a group of people. I have to have that
Mount Everest to climb.
   ``It doesn't matter how many times you walk out there on the
stage, every time it is a great adventure. Anything can happen.''
   Next summer she'll take ``Miss Margarida'' back to Turkey, play
Lady Macbeth in Florida and ``Gypsy'' in Hawaii.
   Parsons has twin daughters from her first marriage _ Martha
Gehman, an actress, and Abbie Britton, a free-lance writer.
   She and her second husband, lawyer Peter Zimroth, are adoptive
parents of Abraham, who's in the first grade.
   ``I really love taking care of my family,'' the actress says.
``I'm really split. I also love to work. In February, I had to give
up taking Abraham skiing. It's really hard. Everybody who works has
that problem.''

<HEAD>Western Sanctions Against China, Never Strong, Are Eroding</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing national interest, humanitarian causes and
business competition, Western democracies are slowly dismantling
the sanctions they imposed on China after the bloody suppression of
the democracy movement last spring.
   Western officials are coming back to renew contacts with Chinese
counterparts, but tourists and businessmen, still apparently wary,
haven't returned in the numbers they came in before.
   The West remains committed, in principle, to limits on
high-level visits, arms sales and new aid packages. But with the
beginning of the year ``exceptions'' have become the rule and some
sanctions, never strong to start with, are withering away even
though repression continues.
   The turning point was the surprise visit in December by U.S.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and disclosures that he
had made a previous visit in July, just a month after the army
killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, in snuffing out the
pro-democracy movement.
   President Bush was assailed in Congress for his overtures to the
hardline Beijing government, but other Western nations quickly
followed suit in easing bans on high-level contacts.
   But the tourists and businessmen who had poured into China after
it opened up to the West a decade ago are staying home.
   Tourist-hotel occupancy rates are only about half what they were
a year ago and the China market seems to have lost its luster for
businessmen as the government reasserts central controls and puts
off new market-oriented reforms.
   ``Businessmen were the first to argue we really ought to get
back in,'' said an Australian diplomat. ``Now they are some of the
most reluctant to come back.''
   John Frisbie of the U.S.-China Business Council said: ``There is
little direct correlation between sanctions and business, but the
direction of Chinese policy was positive before. Now businessmen
are uncertain and will be for some time.''
   The renewed contacts are chiefly governmental.
   The European Economic Community decided in mid-January that
political visits short of the ministerial level were acceptable.
Australia said on Jan. 23 that visits by Cabinet ministers would be
allowed on a case-by-case basis.
   In January, Japan played host to the head of China's State
Planning Commission, and Britain disclosed that Sir Percy Cradock,
senior foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
held secret talks in Beijing in December.
   More crucial to China has been the lifting of bans on credit and
aid. In December the EEC gave its 12 member nations the go-ahead to
extend export credits to China, and Spain responded by announcing a
$30 million development loan in early January.
   On Feb. 2, the U.S. Export-Import bank signed a $9.75 million
loan with a Chinese oil corporation. A week later the bank
announced a $10.4 million grant, part of a $23.1 million package to
encourage China to buy American equipment for a Shanghai subway
project.
   The bank said contracts won by American companies would have
been jeopardized if financing had not been finalized. West Germany
has provided $275 million in preferential credit for the subway
project.
   Only a few private syndicated loans have been made since June
but, as one West German diplomat said, ``Everyone is waiting for
the World Bank.''
   The Chinese ``are almost passionate about World Bank loans,''
said one U.S. official. He said Chinese officials constantly bring
up the $780 million in World Bank concessionary credit suspended
since June and blame the United States for it.
   ``They say, `If the World Bank loans do not come through, we
will retaliate against you,''' the official said.
   On Feb. 8, the World Bank, following a White House decision to
back loans for ``human needs,'' approved a loan package of $30
million to aid an earthquake-struck area of northern China.
   The ban, with 151 nations as members, is still withholding the
big development loan package, but a positive decision could open
the floodgates, particularly from China's main creditor, Japan.
   Japan continues to discourage commercial lending but has also
given the go-ahead to ``human need'' loans and has started talks on
a five-year, $5.6 billion package of development aid.
   Other signs of encroaching normalcy in relations are showing up.
A $600 million U.S. project to develop avionic equipment for
Chinese fighter planes is on course; Chinese engineers were allowed
to return to their jobs at U.S. plants in October.
   A vote by the U.S. Congress in late January to codify sanctions
drew howls of protest from China, but Congress allowed Bush to
waive sanctions if it was in the ``national interest,'' a right he
exercised in approving the export of three U.S.-made satellites to
be launched by Chinese rockets.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced China was
authorized to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of wheat at
subsidized prices and U.S.-China trade in general expanded by
nearly 40 percent in 1989 over 1988.
   Talks are under way to resume the Fulbright program. The Peace
Corps, unable to send its first volunteers last year, hopes to
start its program this year.
   Canada announced in January its first new cultural project since
last year, a community college exchange program.
   Bush and other Western leaders have argued that the Chinese
people should not suffer from sanctions and that it's bad policy to
isolate the Chinese government. So far, however, China has done
little to reciprocate the West's conciliatory gestures.
   The government, in moves mainly intended to improve its
international image and obtain badly needed foreign credit, lifted
martial law in Beijing in January and announced the release of 573
participants in the pro-democracy movement.
   But political repression continues, with dissent outlawed and
thousands of activists languishing in jails without being formally
tried and forbidden to see families and lawyers.
   Government leaders continue to say China's economic reforms and
open door policy go on, yet the Communist Party is reasserting
controls over industry and the propaganda line is that Western
technology is fine but Western values must be repudiated.
   As a consequence, it's hardly ``business as usual'' with China.
Foreign Minister Gareth Evans of Australia has said his country's
continued ban on new aid projects and concessional lending
``reflects the reality that unhappily nothing much has changed
since last June.''
   Japan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Taizo Watanabe, concurred:
``We are ready to cooperate as soon as possible in the direction of
the modernization of China. But the developments under which we can
conduct normal relations have yet to arrive.''
   Tourism, a major source of foreign exchange for China, has
picked up only slightly. Occupancy rates at Beijing's main foreign
tourist hotels averaged around 30 percent in January, compared to
nearly 60 percent a year earlier.
   No major new joint venture projects have been put together since
June. China's trade ministry said foreign loans implemented in 1989
were down 51 percent from the previous year to $4.8 billion, and
technology import contracts were off 25 percent.
   Asked about the prospects for a quick return to normal business
transactions, Liu Xiangdong, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade, said, ``We do not have any
unrealistic fantasies.''

   The helicopter appears as a pinlight on the
northern horizon, the brightest star in a dark blue sky.
   Coming closer, it shoots a wide beam of light over the rooftop
at Jackson Memorial Hospital and settles down with a shuddering
blast of tropical air. Two men inside have been shot twice each
with 9mm bullets, and one is dying.
   Dr. Jeff Vaughan, waiting on the landing pad, turns to a nurse.
``You're going to see blood now, sister,'' he says.
   But spilled blood is routine at Jackson Memorial's trauma
center. Already this evening, the trauma crew has treated a woman
shot by her boyfriend, a man dumped 30 feet off a scaffold, a
10-year-old bicyclist hit by a car and a prison inmate stabbed with
a homemade knife.
   That roster accounts for every serious injury suffered in the
Miami metropolitan area in the preceding six hours. If you're badly
hurt in Dade County these days, the only place to go is Jackson
Memorial.
   That distinction puts Jackson, a publicly financed teaching
hospital, at the forefront of a dismal national trend. It is one of
a shrinking number of big city hospitals offering special care for
trauma, the medical name given to life-threatening injuries.
   In Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and elsewhere, private
hospitals have been shutting down trauma units, most of which
opened in the mid-1980s, the specialty's boom years.
   The resulting squeeze threatens not only quality of health care,
but also the financial stability of the hospitals left carrying the
load.
   Gunfights, car crashes, the occasional industrial accident _
these are the lifeblood of trauma care centers. The American
College of Surgeons estimates that 250 to 350 trauma centers
operate around the country, ranging from such giants as New York's
Bellevue Hospital and Miami's Jackson Memorial to the N.T. Enloe
Hospital in Chico, Calif., and Easton Hospital in Easton, Pa.
   Trauma units are usually affiliated with, but distinct from,
ordinary emergency rooms. ERs handle broken legs, concussions,
poisonings, the lesser varieties of mayhem. Trauma units take over
in more serious cases of multiple injuries _ when lives are on the
line.
   Trauma centers are staffed by surgeons, and major trauma
hospitals keep full staffs of specialists on duty around the clock.
If you need a neurosurgeon at 3 a.m., Jackson Memorial will have
one.
   In rural and suburban areas, trauma is almost always the result
of auto accidents, and the drivers are usually insured. In these
areas, trauma centers pay their way, even make profits.
   But in inner cities, patients increasingly are members of what
doctors caustically refer to as ``the knife and gun club.'' Club
members have a couple of things in common: They are almost always
involved in drugs; they are almost never insured.
   At Jackson Memorial, which handles 6,000 trauma cases a year,
about one-third of the patients are admitted for ``penetrating
trauma'' _ knife or bullet wounds. About one-third of the patients
are uninsured.
   These are expensive injuries, and ``blunt trauma'' injuries
suffered in car crashes can be even costlier. It's not unusual for
trauma-care bills to mount into the tens or even hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   ``Even with the paying patient, trauma is going to cost more
than the average treatment, more than what insurance will probably
pay,'' said Jeanne Eckes, a registered nurse who coordinates
Jackson's trauma service.
   Jackson estimates the trauma unit will lose at least $1.2
million this next fiscal year. In addition to direct losses, the
hospital loses money when trauma patients ``bump'' regular patients
out of operating rooms and intensive care beds. That happens nearly
every day.
   Of four patients admitted to Jackson's trauma center so far this
evening, three have been sent to the operating room or intensive
care. The lone exception is the luckless prison inmate, who's been
treated for his stab wounds and sent back to jail.
   It is already a grueling evening, filled with split-second,
life-or-death decisions. Even the janitor is busy, mopping up blood
from the trauma room floor.
   On a break in the action, Vaughan and another doctor, Alan
Rosenberg, wolf down dinner in the cafeteria. They are there when
Air Rescue calls about 10 p.m.
   Two men with gunshot wounds had shown up at a hospital eight
miles away. They couldn't be treated there _ the hospital doesn't
handle trauma. They are being flown to Jackson.
   On the elevator to the roof, Rosenberg and Vaughan turn goofy
with excitement. They stretch out on the two gurneys and joke and
slap five. They don't get serious until the helicopter is down, and
then, with the blades still blurring overhead, they get serious in
a hurry.
   Vaughan is first into the elevator with the more seriously
wounded man. Before the doors shut, he is frantically at work.
   ``He's not moving any air, man,'' he says, his voice tight with
tension. He shoves a tube down the man's nose and squeezes a
bulbous green bag. A hole in the patient's chest gurgles with blood.
   When the elevator reaches the ground floor, Vaughan runs with
the gurney to the trauma room. His patient is slipping away.
   Patients like this are flown to Jackson every day. The hospital
tallies more than 1,000 helicopter landings a year in what some
doctors say is a legacy of the Vietnam War _ the airborne rescue.
   Some people say the entire modern system of trauma care grew out
of the military's medical experience in Vietnam; others say it
evolved in large urban hospitals in the 1960s.
   Trauma care grew rapidly after research in the late 1970s proved
trauma centers routinely saved lives that would be lost with
ordinary emergency care.
   By the early to mid-1980s, trauma had become hot business. In
search of prestige and profits, hospitals jumped at the opportunity
to treat trauma victims, despite the expense of maintaining a
24-hour staff of surgical specialists.
   Some cities established trauma networks to ensure patients were
sent to the closest trauma hospital. Miami's network, established
in 1985, ultimately consisted of six private hospitals and the
public Jackson Memorial.
   B. Boyd Benjamin, the blunt-talking, gravel-voiced chairman of
the board of the Dade County Public Health Trust, recalls what
happened then.
   ``It was wonderful,'' he said. ``Big committees met, everything
was fine. And the first thing that happened, I guess, was some poor
sonofabitch got run over and didn't have a penny and he ends up at
one of these for-profit hospitals. And they want to ask, `Where's
your insurance?' `I don't have any insurance.' ... They found out
very quickly that this was going to be a loser.''
   In the space of six months in 1987, all six private hospitals
dropped out of the network, leaving Jackson the only metropolitan
area hospital willing to accept adult trauma patients (Miami
Children's Hospital accepts injured children).
   A similar winnowing process has taken place in other big cities
as hospitals discover their expected profits are elusive.
   ``They see it as fiscally irresponsible,'' said Dr. Gerald O.
Strauch, director of the Trauma Department at the American College
of Surgeons in Chicago. ``We all know that hospitals have become
big business, and they're managed like a big business.''

   In Los Angeles County, a regional trauma network with 23
hospitals has shrunk to 13. Chicago had 10 adult trauma hospitals
two years ago; the loss of another hospital this month will reduce
the number to six.
   Houston is down to just one Level I trauma center, capable of
handling the most serious cases. One of Philadelphia's major trauma
centers, Temple University Hospital, recently announced it was
leaving a regional trauma system.
   The hospitals that remain are increasingly overwhelmed, their
trauma centers resembling nothing so much as military MASH units in
the heat of battle. Indeed, the military sends its physicians to
inner city trauma centers to prepare them for combat.
   The consolidation of trauma care raises some daunting questions.
What happens to the patient who's in a serious auto accident and
has to be taken 25 miles to a hospital instead of five? Worse, what
happens when a plane crashes?
   ``It's gotten to the point where, no matter who you are, if
you're injured in a city, your chances of getting to a trauma
center that has everything it needs are getting slimmer,'' said Dr.
Jeff Augenstein, one of the attending surgeons in charge at Jackson.
   Jackson's administrators believe they've found a solution.
Having accepted their hospital's role as the city's only
trauma-care center, they intend to capitalize on it. They are now
trying to raise $25 million for what Benjamin, the public health
trust's board chairman, calls a ``state of the art, world class,
self-contained, free-standing shock-trauma center.''
   The idea is to get trauma patients out of the main hospital,
leaving more room there for regular, paying patients. ``Our
projections show that we will at least break even,'' Benjamin said.
   Hospital officials hope the new center will become a magnet for
research dollars and talented staff. In the meantime, doctors at
Jackson insist they can handle anything that comes their way.
   It is 10:14 p.m. when Jeff Vaughan wheels the gurney into the
trauma room. Half a dozen people jump to action. One slips an
oxygen mask over the patient's face, another takes blood. Vaughan
examines the body. It is young and strong and has bullet holes in
the chest and shoulder. Two police officers stand to the side,
watching.
   ``Where's X-ray?'' Vaughan hollers. ``C'mon, Hector, let's get a
quick film.''
   At 10:18, Vaughan inserts a tube nearly the width of a garden
hose into the left side of the man's chest. It begins pumping
hemorrhaging blood out of the chest cavity and into intravenous
tubes for transfusion. Vaughan's rubber gloves and gown are covered
with blood; red dots shine on his eyeglass lenses.
   ``What's his pressure?'' someone shouts.
   ``Very, very low,'' Vaughan yells back. ``He's got serious
problems in his chest.''
   He goes to the other side and inserts another tube. ``We've got
blood on this side too, guys, and lots of it.''
   Within minutes, the crisis ebbs. The patient's systolic blood
pressure, about 50 when he entered the trauma room, is up to 110.
His pulse is strong. He breathes with the aid of the oxygen mask.
   The gurney is pushed out the door and up to the operating room.
   ``He's a long way from being OK, but he's got a chance,''
Vaughan says.
   Bloody footprints mark the path down the hall.
   It has been a remarkable display of grace under pressure, but it
isn't enough this time. The patient dies 10 minutes into surgery.
   His buddy survives, and not for the first time. Medical records
show he's been treated at Jackson before for gunshot wounds _ six
times.
   ``Hey, man, you gonna get some frequent flier miles if you keep
coming in here,'' Vaughan tells him.
   Police say the two men claimed to have been attacked on the
street for no reason; the cops' tone suggests disbelief.
   Vaughan drifts into an employee lounge for a Dr Pepper and a
smoke. He is about 18 hours into a 24-hour shift and it is
beginning to show. He speaks bitterly about the strains of the job
and patients who ``would just as soon kill us as look at us.''
   ``It's a war zone,'' he says. ``And it's like this in every
major city.''

<TEXT>
   Alaska is a young frontier state where
old-timers still are called pioneers. And being a pioneer has its
benefits.
   The state runs six bargain-rate retirement homes, pays residents
65 and older $250 a month regardless of need, provides them a
property-tax exemption or rent rebate, and issues free hunting and
fishing licenses.
   There also are local sales-tax exemptions, free university
tuition and free transportation on state ferries.
   Compared to other states, Alaska is generous to its elderly. But
that may not last the decade.
   They are exacting a growing cost as Alaska's population ages.
And a severe drop in oil revenues expected this decade already has
led to changes in the most expensive programs.
   The residency requirement for the $250-a-month ``longevity
bonus'' was increased from one to two years Jan. 1, and the
Legislature is considering phasing out the program over the next
two decades. And rates at the state's ``pioneers' homes'' were
increased by as much as 52 percent recently.
   After planning their retirement around the programs, many older
residents fear they may be ``left out in the street'' in their
final years, said Barbara Bathony, director of the state Pioneers'
Benefits Division.
   ``It is traumatic for a person in their later years to have to
think, `What is going to happen to me?''' said Joe Alter of Juneau,
a 74-year-old retired civil engineer who moved to Alaska 46 years
ago ``when nobody thought of retiring here.''
   Changes are inevitable, said Rep. Red Boucher of Anchorage, who
is 69. If changes are made carefully and over time, he said, senior
citizens will adjust.
   ``We treat them as good as any other state in the union, if not
better,'' he said. ``I think that's good. We just have to achieve a
balance in it. I don't know of a single Alaskan who wouldn't agree
with that.''
   Alaska began caring for its older residents long before it
became a state in 1959. The first pioneers' home opened in Sitka in
1913.
   This year the state expects to spend more than $25 million to
run the homes for about 540 residents.
   More than double that amount is spent on the unique longevity
bonus program, created in 1972 to reward people who had helped
settle the Alaska territory. At first it provided $100 a month to
Alaskans 65 and older who had lived in the state continuously for
at least 25 years.
   ``It started out as a great idea for those people who came here
in hard times and made many sacrifices,'' Boucher said.
   In 1984, however, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled the 25-year
residency rule unconstitutional. The number of recipients and the
program's cost increased sharply. Today more than 19,000 Alaskans
claim the bonuses, at a cost of about $62 million a year, including
administrative expenses.
   Proponents say that investment pays off economically and
socially. For many older Alaskans, the bonus helps them meet the
state's high cost of living.
   ``There's a strong feeling that senior citizens want to become
part of this society. They don't want to be isolated,'' Alter said.
``Some of those benefits make it possible for these people to stay
here economically. Otherwise they'd be going south.''
   ``When they leave they take their savings accounts, their
pensions and their retirement money out of state,'' said Connie
Sipe, executive director of the state Older Alaskans Commission.
   The programs apparently have kept the elderly in Alaska and
brought in a few more. The number of Alaskans over 65 has grown at
a rate faster than the overall population since 1970, according to
the state Labor Department. In 1988 those over 65 accounted for 3.8
percent of Alaska's population, up from 2.3 percent in 1970.
   ``We are having a little in-migration,'' Sipe said. ``I don't
think it's because of the benefits. I think it's because of
family.''
   Even without transplants, Alaska's older population is expected
to continue growing in the 1990s. Alaskans ages 55-64, who soon
will be signing up for longevity bonuses and beds in pioneers'
homes, represent 5.4 percent of the population.
   That's still a small percentage, ``but they make up 15 to 20
percent of the voting block,'' making lawmakers reluctant to attack
the programs publicly, said Rep. Terry Martin of Anchorage.
   ``I'm not concerned because I don't think anything's going to
happen right away,'' said Mellie Terwilliger, 80, an Alaskan for 60
years who lives with her husband in Tok near their son and his
family.
   She said senior citizens have considerable political clout in
Juneau. ``We're very well-organized.''
   Martin favors basing the bonus on need. A couple with a pair of
pensions, social security income and investments do not need an
extra $500 a month from the state, he said.
   But Sipe notes a 1984 study for the Older Alaskans Commission,
which showed that half the longevity bonus recipients lived on
$10,000 a year or less. The study said 17.6 percent had incomes
above $20,000.
   State Sen. Jay Kerttula, a creator of the longevity bonus, said
it was not based on need because that would have made it seem like
welfare. Lawmakers ``understood from their lifetime of experiences
on the frontier what allowed a frontiersman to accept some type of
assistance with some dignity,'' Kerttula said.
   Basing the bonus on need would require more bureaucracy, and the
increased costs would outweigh any savings, said Vera Gazaway,
executive director of the non-profit Older Persons Action Group
Inc. in Anchorage.
   Kerttula has proposed an annuity plan to replace state funding
of the bonus, an idea that has not yet become law.
   State retirement homes also are becoming more costly.
   Pioneers' homes are for those over 65 who have been continuous
residents of Alaska for at least 15 years. However, destitute
Alaskans get priority and do not have to meet the age limit.
One-sixth of those in the homes at the end of 1989 were considered
destitute.
   The greatest demand is for beds in the nursing-care units, where
the wait can run to five years. The rates, up to $800 a month for
nursing care, compare with private nursing homes that charge more
than $5,000 a month.
   The six homes are a major part of the elderly health-care system
in Alaska. There are no profit-making nursing homes and only 12
private, non-profit facilities _ all but one with fewer than 100
beds.
   The pioneers' homes charge only those who can afford to pay, and
because of the restrictive residency requirements the homes do not
get federal Medicaid money. Bathony said that while costs have
continued to rise, the Legislature has not increased the homes'
budget since 1986.
   Alaska needs a system for home care as an alternative to nursing
homes, Sipe said. Legislation is pending that would allow the state
to use Medicaid money for home care.
   ``We're quite behind other states,'' she said. ``We're in the
bottom third in terms of home-care options for seniors.''

   Annual benefits for an Alaskan over 65
total in the thousands of dollars. Here's a description:
   LONGEVITY BONUS: $250 a month to all Alaskans 65 and older who
have lived in the state continuously for at least two years. No
income limit.
   PIONEERS' HOMES: Six state-run retirement homes for those over
65 who have been continuous residents for at least 15 years.
Exception to age requirement for the destitute. Rates from $525 a
month for minimal services to $800 a month for nursing care.
Compares to private nursing-home rates of more than $5,000 a month.
   PROPERTY TAXES: First $150,000 of assessed value of a home is
exempt from tax for homeowners 65 and older. No income limit.
Average benefit is $1,000 a year. Must have been a resident of the
state since Jan. 1 of the given year.
   RENT REBATE: For renters over 65, the rebate is designed to
provide the equivalent of the property-tax exemption. Based on rent
paid, no income limit. Average 1989 benefit was $623. Must have
been a resident of the state since Jan. 1.
   SALES TAXES: Requirements and benefits vary by city or borough.
In Juneau, for example, those over 65 are exempt from the 4 percent
sales tax and can ride city buses free. The city estimates the
average tax savings at $400 a year.
   TUITION: Those 60 and older can take classes tuition-free at the
University of Alaska on a space-available basis if they meet normal
admission requirements. Tuition at the three largest campuses runs
$546 a semester for a full undergraduate course load.
   HUNTING, FISHING &amp; TRAPPING: The state offers an identification
card for those 60 and older, which substitutes for the $32 annual
hunting, fishing and trapping license. Must have been a resident at
least a year to qualify.
   FERRY RIDES: The Alaska Marine Highway System offers free
passage within the state for anyone over 65 from Oct. 1 to May 15.
In summer, free passage is available on the three smaller ferries
only as space is available. Does not include vehicle or cabin
charges. Savings varies from $12 to $82 for a one-way trip in
winter.

<HEAD>Flannery: At 88, Still Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It used to take the old IRA man an hour to cross
the room at a NORAID fund-raiser, besieged as he was by people who
wanted to shake his hand, kiss his cheek or snap his picture.
   This, they'd tell their children, is Michael Flannery: the
teen-age soldier who fought the British in Ireland's war of
independence; the young man who moved to America but never forgot
Ireland; the old man who founded Irish Northern Aid to support the
Irish Republican Army's battle against British rule in Northern
Ireland.
   But when NORAID held its annual dinner last month, for the first
time in 18 years Michael Flannery stayed home.
   At 88, most people are inclined to ease off, accepting easy
acclaim and benign deference. Not Flannery. He has denounced the
leaders of NORAID and of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political party, for
placing too much faith in politics and not enough in military force.
   ``It grieved me to leave NORAID, because I was its founder,'' he
says in his squeaky brogue. ``But it was the only thing my
conscience would allow me to do.''
   For three-quarters of a century, Flannery's conscience
repeatedly has forced him to choose principle over expediency, and
to fight other Irishmen over how to best fight the British.
   On a recent morning Flannery greeted a reporter at the door of
his Queens home. His step, once brisk, now inclined toward a
shuffle, and his back, once ramrod stiff, was slightly hunched. He
sat on a piano bench in the living room, folded his long, thin
hands on his lap and talked for two hours straight.
   He began not a month, a year, or a decade ago, but on Easter
1916, when Irish nationalists rose against British rule. He was a
lanky 14-year-old from Tipperary who volunteered to run messages
for the rebels.
   The Anglo-Irish conflict ended in 1921 with a treaty giving 26
of Ireland's 32 counties virtual independence as the predominantly
Roman Catholic Irish Free State, based in Dublin. But the six
mostly Protestant northeastern counties remained part of the United
Kingdom, and civil war ensued in the south between those for and
against the partition.
   Flannery joined the anti-treaty IRA faction led by Eamon de
Valera, and was captured and imprisoned for two years. He saw
several of his comrades executed in reprisal for IRA attacks, and
he took part in a 39-day hunger strike. He left prison as bitter at
Dublin as he was at London.
   De Valera, however, formed a new political party in 1926 and led
his supporters into the Dublin parliament. Flannery, meanwhile, had
moved to America; he watched in horror as de Valera rose to power
and crushed the IRA, which still fought for a unified Irish
republic.
   ``Within four years de Valera was arresting IRA men,'' Flannery
said. ``Four years after that he was executing them.''
   Flannery settled in the New York City borough of Queens with his
wife, got a job with an insurance company and joined Irish athletic
and cultural groups. And he raised money for the IRA.
   The American Irish lost interest in Ireland's intramural
squabbles, but Flannery never gave up. He claimed to have visited
every saloon in New York City, looking for donations even though he
was a teetotaler _ a remnant of military discipline.
   When a rising tide of violence against Catholics in Northern
Ireland revived the IRA in the late 1960s, Flannery was ready.
   Again he faced a choice: the ``official'' IRA, which decided to
seek power politically or the ``provisional'' IRA, which took up
arms in the North.
   Flannery threw in with the Provos. With a few other vets, he
founded NORAID.
   Flannery insisted that the millions NORAID collected went to the
families of dead or imprisoned IRA soldiers. But in 1981 he was
arrested on his way out of church and accused of banking an
operation to smuggle guns to the IRA.
   At the trial, Flannery delivered his own opening statement. ``We
are indicted here for the love of freedom,'' he said, ``and the
love of freedom alone.''
   Even those opposed to the IRA, whose attacks often killed or
maimed civilians, were moved by such a durable passion. Although
Flannery and his co-defendants essentially admitted the
accusations, they were found innocent, and the next year Flannery
was elected grand marshal of the New York St. Patrick's Day parade.
   But America's guns, money and prayers did not resolve Northern
Ireland's troubles, and in 1986 Sinn Fein declared itself willing
to take seats in the Dublin parliament, a body from which militant
nationalists had abstained since the island's partition. To
Flannery, this was official recognition of the government that had
imprisoned him, killed his comrades and sold out the North.
   The IRA sided with Sinn Fein, as did most of NORAID's younger
members. Flannery did not press the issue; he continued to attend
some NORAID functions, and NORAID continued to use his name.
   But last year a rift developed in NORAID, and Flannery joined
dissidents in accusing the organization's leaders of steering it
``toward politics and away from its original humanitarian
objectives.''
   Shortly thereafter he stood before NORAID's executive committee
in a wedding hall in Queens and accused Sinn Fein's leaders of
being ``Free Staters'' whose devotion to politics would soommunist Party
chief Milos Jakes.
   The country's first parliamentary elections in more than four
decades are planned for June 8.
   Havel, 53, who has said he is more interested in being a writer
than president, is popular among his countrymen and has not
announced whether he will seek election in June.
   Havel's government has insisted the Soviet Union withdraw its
73,500 troops as quickly as possible and favors eventual
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Some Czechoslovakian officials also
have urged that NATO be phased out, something the Bush
administration strongly opposes.

   The weather isn't the only thing behaving
strangely this winter. The economy has been topsy-turvy as well.
   In just two months, December and January, many economists went
from predicting an impending economic downturn to believing that
the longest peacetime expansion in history has found another of its
nine lives.
   The new general consensus of moderate economic growth this year
is likely to be an important element in Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony today before Congress, when he reveals
the Fed's policy targets for 1990. These targets will have a major
influence on interest rates and economic growth.

   Next year, the United States will for the first time launch

   Former Guinness PLC Chairman Ernest Saunders
received $5.1 million in company funds in a secret Swiss bank
account while he led Guinness' bid for Distillers Co., a prosecutor
charged at the trial of Saunders and three others on charges
stemming from the 1986 takeover.
   John Chadwick, a prosecutor from the Serious Fraud Office, told
of the alleged payment as he concluded his opening statement Monday
at the trial, which began last week.
   The four defendants face a total of 35 charges involving theft,
false accounting and conspiracy in connection with Guinness'
acquisition of Distillers, a Scottish manufacturer of whisky and
gin.
   The aim of the alleged conspiracy was to boost prices of
Guinness' stock, making the company's $4.3 billion cash and stock
bid more attractive than a rival bid from supermarket operator
Argyll Group PLC.
   The funds deposited in Saunders' account came from an illegal
payment from Guinness director Thomas Ward, Chadwick said.
   ``Money which Saunders claimed had been paid to Ward so that
Ward could pay consultancy fees to other people in fact found its
way into Saunders' own bank account in Switzerland,'' Chadwick said.
   British authorities are seeking Ward's extradition from the
United States. Ward has denied any wrongdoing.
   Chadwick's opening statement was being made before the second
jury impaneled to hear the case. The first jury was dismissed after
three jurors withdrew for work and health reasons.
   Three other defendants are still awaiting trial in connection
with what was then the largest takeover battle in British history.
   Guinness won the battle in April 1986. But in December of that
year, the Department of Trade and Industry announced it was
investigating the deal, and the allegations of financial wrongdoing
emerged.
   Standing trial with 54-year-old Saunders are Gerald Ronson, 50,
chairman of the diversified conglomerate Heron International PLC;
former stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 44; and millionaire financier
and arts patron Sir Jack Lyons, 74.
   In the second trial, not scheduled to begin before October,
Saunders will be joined by Roger Seelig, 44, former Morgan Grenfell
and Co. Ltd. corporate finance director; Lord Patrick Spens, 47,
former director of corporate finance at the merchant bank Henry
Ansbacher and Co. Ltd.; and David Mayhew, 48, who continues as
senior corporate finance partner of the investment firm Cazenove
and Co.
   The seven men have pleaded innocent to the charges and each is
free on bail.
   Saunders faces two counts of conspiring to violate the
Prevention of Fraud Act; two counts of authorizing or permitting
Guinness to violate the Companies Act; eight counts of false
accounting; two counts of theft and one count of destroying company
documents.
   Ronson faces one count of conspiring to violate the Prevention
of Fraud Act; one count of aiding and abetting Saunders to
authorize or permit Guinness to violate the Companies Act; two
counts of false accounting and one count of theft.
   Parnes faces five counts of false accounting and two counts of
theft.
   Lyons faces one count of conspiring to violate the Prevention of
Fraud Act; one count of conspiracy to violate the Companies Act;
one count of aiding and abetting Saunders to authorize or permit
Guinness to violate the Companies Act; four counts of false
accounting and one count of theft.

<TEXT>
   Companies with international operations may find
it easier to set up a worldwide telephone and data-transmission
network using a new digital phone service offered by AT&amp;T.
   The phone company on Monday demonstrated potential uses for the
service, which links the United States with Japan and Great Britain
using an international transmission standard. A number of other
nations are expected to be added to the network by the end of the
year.
   The service can be dialed up like a regular phone call once a
special digital line is installed to the customer, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said.
   Unlike conventional analog phone lines, digital lines enable the
transmission of computer data and video conferences. They also
provide distortion-free phone calls and far faster fax
transmissions overseas.
   AT&amp;T began offering dial-up digital lines to other nations in
1988, but these lines are based on a North American standard, which
transmits data at 56 kilobits per second. Most of the rest of the
world uses digital lines that transmit data at 64 kilobits per
second.
   A kilobit is 1,000 bits. A bit is the smallest piece of
information used by a computer, and represents either the digit 1
or 0.
   The difference in standards has meant U.S. customers must use an
adaptor to send computer-based information abroad, which creates
the possiblity that errors could be introduced in the transmission,
said AT&amp;T spokesman Rick Wallerstein.
   With the new service, which was announced last month, a U.S.
company could set up a phone and data-transmission network around
the world based on the 64-kilobit standard.
   Before the dial-up digital services were available, the only way
for a company to send computer data overseas was through a leased,
private line. These ``dedicated'' lines are more expensive in
general than the dial-up services, which are billed per minute of
use like conventional phone lines.
   The new Switched Digital International service was approved Feb.
5 by the Federal Communications Commission.
   The service to Japan is provided in cooperation with Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and Overseas Communications Japan,
while the British service is a venture with British Telecom PLC.
   At a news conference Monday , AT&amp;T demonstrated a video
conference hookup with Tokyo using two of the new phone lines
simultaneously. Because video transmissions contain a huge amount
of data, their quality is improved by sending it over two lines at
once.
   But the picture quality still is lower than what is provided by
normal television broadcasts. The image is grainy and the motion is
delayed, giving the impression that the video is being shown in
slow motion.
   The equipment used for the video conference is made by
PictureTel Corp. of Peabody, Mass., which has a marketing agreement
with AT&amp;T.
   AT&amp;T also demonstrated a personal computer linkup through the
phone lines. When changes were made on a computer screen in New
York, they could be seen on a similar computer screen in Tokyo by
watching the TV monitor used for the video conference.
   In addition, AT&amp;T demonstrated a digital telephone, which
provides far higher quality voice transmission than conventional
phones, and an optical scanner that allows the user to scan
documents or objects electronically, then send them over the phone
lines abroad, where they appear on a computer screen.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone also demonstrated computer and
video hookups over the new phone lines.

<TEXT>
   The head of the government's savings
and loan bailout board defended his agency's track record against
criticism that it has been slow to act.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp. as
well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., on Monday cited a
barrage of statistics to demonstrate his agency's progress since
its creation last year.
   The RTC has taken over more than 350 thrifts in 37 states and
advanced $11.4 billion to institutions to stem runs on deposits or
replace high-cost brokered deposits, Seidman told the American
Bankers Association's National Conference for Community Bankers.
   In addition, the RTC has listed for sale about a tenth of the
300,000 properties it took over from the failed thrifts, Seidman
said.
   Seidman said he has hired a staff of almost 1,900 people while
in the process of merging his agency with the the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp., a merger he described as ``a marriage
that is about the equal of Trump versus Trump,'' referring to the
marital troubles of develop Donald Trump and his wife, Ivana.
   He also said the agency has developed a strategic plan for how
it will attack the S&amp;L problem.
   ``Given the bureaucractic world we live in, that alone is
earthshaking,'' he said.
   Seidman said the thrift bailout should be a boon to lawyers.
   The RTC is handling more than 40,000 lawsuits against failed
thrifts, ``and that's just the beginning,'' he said. ``We expect
80,000 by the end of the year and over one-half billion dollars in
outside legal fees'' on top of the expenses for about 1,000
government lawyers.
   ``We are well under way to creating a shortage of lawyers in
this country,'' he quipped.
   Seidman spoke at the Phoenecian Resort, the palatial luxury
complex built by Charles H. Keating Jr. Keating's thrift, Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif., and the
resort were taken over by the government last year. Regulators say
Lincoln could become the most costly thrift bailout ever.
   Seidman joked that he wanted to put a stop to some rumors that
were circulating at the bankers convention. Among them, he said,
was that the Phoenecian would be given away as a door prize.
   On another topic, Seidman criticized the credit union industry,
saying it was expanding too quickly and overstating its financial
strength.
   Credit unions, Seidman said, have been claiming that their
deposit-insurance fund, run by the National Credit Union
Administration, is stronger than that of other institutions because
credit unions keep 1 percent of the funds on deposit with the NCUA.
But the practice is deceptive because the credit unions also book
the money as assets, Seidman said.
   Credit unions are growing extremely quickly and are increasing
their investments in areas where they have little experience, he
said. ``They've got a lot of the symptoms that the S&amp;Ls had,'' he
said.
   Many critics of the thrift industry attribute the bulk of its
problems to rapid growth and bad investments in projects outside
its traditional bread-and-butter areas, such as housing loans.

<HEAD>Wendy's Fourth-Quarter Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wendy's International Inc. reported a 16
percent drop in net income for the fourth quarter of 1989, but
noted that earnings for the year increased 7 percent over 1988.
   The restaurant chain also reported Monday that systemwide sales
topped $3 billion for the first time in company history.
   Wendy's, based in suburban Columbus, cited no specific reason
for the drop in fourth-quarter earnings. President and Chief
Executive Officer James W. Near said the company ended the year
with 55 fewer restaurants, mostly because of sales to franchise
owners.
   For the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31, 1989, after-tax
profit totaled $5.7 million, or 6 cents a share, on revenue of
$261.1 million. That compared with earnings of $6.8 million, or 7
cents a share, on revenue of $258.7 million in the same 1988 period.
   Profits for all of 1989 rose to $30.4 million, or 32 cents a
share, from $28.5 million, or 30 cents a share, in 1988. Revenue
also were up, from $1.06 billion in 1988 to $1.07 billion.
   Wendy's said the results include a first-quarter accounting
change for income taxes. The change improved net income by $5.2
million, or 5 cents a share.
   Systemwide sales, which include total sales from company and
franchise restaurants, were $740 million for the quarter, up from
$711 million during the comparable period in 1988. For the year,
sales totaled $3.04 billion, compared with $2.9 billion the
previous year.
   Near said customer transactions, which realized a 3 percent gain
during the third quarter, grew another 4 percent in the fourth
quarter. He said a new menu offering selected items at 99 cents
each and an advertising campaign featuring Wendy's founder R. David
Thomas were significant reasons for the jump in transactions.
   ``I'm satisfied with our progress ... but I know we must make
more dramatic improvements to gain market share in the '90s,'' Near
said.
   At year's end, there were 3,755 Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers
restaurants worldwide, including 1,118 operated by the company.

<HEAD>Farley Faces Trouble Financing West Point Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago industrialist William F. Farley may be in
financial trouble over his $58-a-share hostile takeover of
Georgia-based West Point Pepperell Inc. last year.
   Farley faces a March deadline for his $1.03 billion ``bridge''
loan.
   But the investment banking firm he was using to issue junk bonds
_ Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. _ is going out of business after its
parent company filed for bankruptcy protection and Farley has been
unable to sell any of West Point's major assets.
   ``He's getting squeezed more and more,'' said Edward F. Johnson,
director of Johnson Redbook Service, a New York research firm.
``It's getting tougher. The textile business is slowing; plants he
wanted to sell would (bring) less and he certainly wouldn't have
paid as much for West Point this year as he did.''
   Last April, Farley paid $1.6 billion for 95 percent of West
Point's shares and assumed about $1 billion in debt for the
well-respected Georgia textile and apparel firm. The purchase came
after a bitter fight with former Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Joseph L. Lanier Jr., whose family had run the company for
years.
   However, Farley must sell about $350 million in assets to
receive an extension of his bridge loan through June, and sales
aren't going well.
   A jittery financial market has ``caused a lot of buyers to pull
back out of the market,'' said Edgar Davis, executive vice
president of West Point. ``Money that would normally be available
to financial investors is out of their reach right now for a lot of
reasons.''
   Drexel's Chapter 11 filing also hurts, said Richard Byrne, a
junk bond analyst with Merrill Lynch.
   ``West Point is an excellent company. Unfortunately it's highly
leveraged,'' he said, adding that the company's paper in today's
shaky junk bond market would be ``difficult to sell if not
impossible.''
   Last April, West Point issued $905 million in private placement
of junk bonds. A week before Drexel filed for bankruptcy, two of
the leading bond rating agencies lowered their ratings of Farley
Inc., West Point-Pepperell and some subsidiaries.
   Last year, Farley announced it had reached an agreement to sell
the hosiery, shirt and tailored apparel divisions of Cluett Peabody
&amp; Company Inc. to a Paris-based company for $600 million, lower
than the $700 million Farley sought.
   The deal was to have closed last November. But reports in the
trade press say the price has now dropped to $430 million and that
one of the major banks backing the buyer, Bidermann Group, has
backed out. A spokesman for Bidermann Industries USA Inc. declined
to comment on whether price has been a factor. The deal is now
expected to close next month.
   Farley has made some nuts-and-bolts changes at West Point. He
hired Charles A. Lieppe, who had worked 21 years with Procter &amp;
Gamble Co., as president and chief operating officer.
   And Davis said Farley intends to concentrate on the company's
strong core business of bed and bath products.
   The company has added 800 people at five plants making the
products, and Davis said another 100 jobs may be added during the
first six months of 1990. Farley also has invested between $80
million and $90 million in equipment and physical improvements to
make the bed and bath plants more efficient.

<HEAD>Hormel Considers Buying Frozen-Food Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After reporting an increase in
first-quarter earnings, Hormel Chairman Richard Knowlton said the
meatpacker is considering buying a company that would expand its
frozen sandwich line.
   Knowlton told securities analysts Monday in Fort Lauderdale,
Fla., that the Austin-based company aims to grow mainly through
internal expansion and new products, but also is searching for
acquisitions.
   Hormel is close to completing a deal for a company that would
extend its frozen sandwich line, Knowlton told analysts at the
Food, Beverage and Tobacco Conference in Fort Lauderdale. While he
would not name the company, he said its annual sales were about $60
million.
   Knowlton also said Hormel will bolster its weak position in
Europe by setting up a joint partnership with a European food
company.
   But Knowlton told analysts that he expects one of his company's
strongest areas of growth to be prepared foods that need no
refrigeration and are designed to be prepared in microwave ovens.
   Hormel's Top Shelf line accounted for about $100 million in
sales last year, and he expects that to double in the near future.
Meanwhile, he expects Micro Cup Meals to exceed Top Shelf sales.
And his company is test marketing a complementary line called Kid's
Kitchen, which children can prepare for themselves.
   Hormel, meanwhile, announced record earnings for the first
quarter ended Jan. 27.
   Net income of $14.4 million, or 19 cents per share, compared
with net income of $13.7 million, or 18 cents per share, in the
first quarter of fiscal 1989. Earnings per share were restated to
account for a two-for-one stock split effective Jan. 31, the
company said.
   Securities analysts had expected a decline in earnings because
of restricted pork supplies and increased raw materials cost.
   Dollar sales for the first quarter also were at a record high
$620.5 million, a 12.6 percent increase over sales of $551.2
million in the first quarter of last year.

<HEAD>Japanese, U.S. Contractors Reach Basic Agreement on New Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main Japanese contractor said Tuesday it has
reached agreement in principle with a U.S. aircraft maker on
developing Japan's next jet fighter, a project that triggered
charges of a U.S. technology giveaway.
   Junichiro Yamada, an official of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Co., said the formal agreement with General Dynamics Corp. of the
United States on developing the FSX is to be signed by early next
week.
   Then, he said, those two firms, together with Kawasaki Heavy
Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., both of Japan, will set
up a team to design the FSX, an advanced version of the U.S. F-16.
   Critics in the U.S. Congress have charged that the project will
amount to a giveaway of U.S. technology in aeronautics, where the
United States still enjoys a competitive edge. Proponents of the
plan contend both sides will gain military and technological
benefits.
   Defense Agency officials have said a total of 165 billion yen,
or about $1.15 billion, will be needed over eight years to develop
the plane, which is expected to go into production in 1997.
   Yamada said the team, consisting of 100 engineers, including 10
from General Dynamics, will begin design work at MHI's aerospace
systems works in Nagoya, central Japan, in late March. He declined
to discuss further details.
   On Nov. 29, 1988, the United States and Japan signed a
memorandum of understanding on the FSX development. The Japanese
Defense Agency appointed MHI as the prime contractor and General
Dynamiscs, KHI and FHI as subcontractors.
   On Jan. 12, 1989, MHI and General Dynamics reached a licensing
and technical assistance agreement covering the transfer of
technical information on the U.S. F-16 to Japan.
   Last April, Congress passed legislation that sought, among other
things, to prohibit transfer to Japan of critical U.S. jet engine
technology.
   President Bush vetoed U.S. Congressional efforts to impose
restrictions on the U.S.-Japan deal for joint development.
   Japan originally intended to develop the new fighter on its own.
The United States wanted it to buy U.S. planes. The two sides then
agreed on co-development.

<HEAD>Heileman Halts Talks With Stroh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stroh Brewing Co. and G. Heileman Brewing Co.
have cut off talks of a possible merger or sale of some Heileman
brands, Heileman's president says.
   The trade newsletter Beer Marketer's Insights quoted Heileman
President Murray Cutbush as telling wholesalers last week that
discussions with Stroh had ended.
   Cindy Brown, Cutbush's secretary at Heileman's LaCrosse, Wis.,
offices, was out of the office and unavailable for comment early
this morning.
   Cutbush said Stroh had approached Heileman ``regarding a
possible merger'' after a deal for Stroh to sell to Adolph Coors
Co. fell apart last year.
   Lacey Logan, a spokeswoman for Stroh, declined to comment. Stroh
is the nation's third-largest brewer behind Anheuser-Busch Inc. and
Miller Brewing Co. Coors and Heileman follow.
   Stroh executives were examining a three-way deal that would have
included unidentified banks as partners, the newsletter said. The
partnership would have enabled Stroh and Heileman to combine
without putting up any cash. The banks would provide financing and
reap part of the profits as owners.
   There was no indication why the talks broke off.
   Earlier this month, Heileman said its breweries in Frankenmuth
and St. Paul, Minn., were for sale, along with the brands they
produce.
   Heileman employs about 200 people at the Frankenmuth brewery,
which it purchased from Carling National Co. in 1979.
   Stroh has been looking for potential partners since February
1989 amid financial struggles that have resulted in more than 300
layoffs and sales of some Stroh properties and divisions, including
its ice-cream business.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. might find
itself embroiled in another battle over the test marketing of a
cigarette, a leading women's advocate says.
   After a national firestorm of criticism a month ago, Reynolds
shelved plans to market in Philadelphia a new menthol brand called
Uptown, a cigarette the company said was targeted for black smokers.
   Now the company plans to test-market a cigarette called Dakota
in Houston in April. According to news accounts, a marketing plan
designed for the cigarette would gear a publicity campaign toward
young women with a high school education or less.
   R.J. Reynolds, a division of RJR Nabisco Inc., says it has not
seen the marketing plan.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said Monday from Washington in an interview with the Greensboro
News &amp; Record that she will encourage women's groups in Houston to
organize and combat Dakota as black groups battled Uptown in
Philadelphia.
   ``I personally, and I'm sure I speak for a huge majority of NOW
members, cannot understand how any self-respecting company could
seek to exploit so deliberately a group of young women who clearly,
because they are not college-bound, probably never read any reports
from the surgeon general on smoking,'' she said.
   ``They are deliberately leading them into a mode of life which
will probably lead to their premature death.''
   A marketing plan said to have been leaked to The Washington
Post, The Wall Street Journal and the magazine Ad Age, said that
Dakota's chief goal is to capture the lucrative market among 18- to
24-year-old women with a high school education or less, the only
group of Americans whose rate of smoking continues to increase.
   But a spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds challenged the validity of
the marketing plan. Maura Payne said R.J. Reynolds has not seen the
plan, which was developed under contract by an outside firm, and
does not know if it was fabricated or altered in any way.
   She said the cigarette is designed to compete against Marlboro.
   ``Anyone that is stealing documents and disseminating them is
not above, in my mind, doing some altering of the documents as well
to serve whatever agenda they seem to have,'' Ms. Payne said.
   She said R.J. Reynolds would stand by its new cigarette.
   ``We will bring it to market and we will let the smokers, the
consumers, decide if it's a viable competitor for Marlboro or
not,'' Ms. Payne said.
   Marlboro, made by rival Philip Morris, is the world's
best-selling cigarette, outselling Reynolds' Winston brand by
almost 2-1. Philip Morris is the world's top cigarette maker, and
in recent years has increased its U.S. market share over No. 2
Reynolds.
   In Houston, anti-smoking groups might mount a fight against
Dakota.
   ``I very strongly feel there will be an (opposition) effort,''
Eleanor Tinsley, a Houston City Council member, said Monday. ``This
is a particularly vulnerable group of young women. To pick a group
of young women who have not received a great deal of education and
then give them cigarettes is, from my point of view,
reprehensible.''
   Three years ago, Ms. Tinsley pushed through an ordinance that
gave Houston its first public smoking restrictions.

<HEAD>Natwest's 1989 Profit Sinks 79 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Westminster Bank PLC, one of Britain's
big four commercial banks, said Tuesday its net profit sank 79
percent in 1989, largely due to a sharp increase in provisions for
loan losses.
   Natwest said its net profit for the year came to 198 million
pounds, the equivalent of $339 million, compared with 938 million
pounds, or $1.6 billion, a year earlier. Earnings per share came to
15 pence, or 26 cents, compared with 62 pence, or $1.06.
   Natwest said it pre-tax profit slid 71 percent to 404 million
pounds, or $687 million, from 1.407 billion pounds, or $2.41
billion.
   Total loan provisions for the year of 1.435 billion pounds, or
$2.45 billion, which included charges for advances to lesser
developed countries, were more than five times the charges Natwest
took in 1988.
   Of its latest charges, 990 million pounds, or $1.69 billion,
represented charges for loans to lesser developed countries,
sharply higher than 49 million pounds, or $84 million, in such
charges a year earlier.
   Natwest Chairman Lord Alexander said that as a result of the
bank's provisioning for loans to lesser developed countries, which
increased its coverage on problem sovereign loans to 75 percent
from 36 percent in 1988, Natwest has put the debt problem ``firmly
behind us.''
   The bank also took an exceptional charge of 50 million pounds,
or $86 million, in 1989 to cover legal fees and other potential
costs associated with criminal charges stemming from its investment
bank's handling of a stock sale for Blue Arrow PLC in 1987.
   County Natwest Investment Bank Ltd., the main underwriter of the
issue, has been charged with failing to disclose a 9.5 percent
stake it was left with in Blue Arrow after the share sale flopped.
   Alexander said of the provisions and exceptional charge, ``We
believe all these actions are sensible and, on the basis of our
fundamental strengths and trading record, are a platform for
further progress.''
   Natwest also took an extraordinary charge of 35 million pounds,
or $60 million, largely to cover costs involved in its withdrawal
as a primary dealer in the U.S. Treasury market.
   Total income, including interest income, commissions, and
foreign exchange, came to 5.36 billion pounds, or $9.2 billion, up
15 percent from 4.66 billion pounds, $7.9 billion.
   Total assets at the end of the year were 116.2 billion pounds,
or $199 billion, up from 98.6 billion pounds, or $169 billion.
   Natwest didn't break out fourth-quarter or half-year results. It
isn't required to under British law.

<HEAD>Education Board Sues Over Channel One</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some local school officials criticized the
State Board of Education after it decided to sue over the use of a
commercial television program and to expand its ban on the product.
   The board voted Monday to take the Thomasville City school
system to court because of its refusal to abide by the state
board's ban on the use of Channel One, a 12-minute commercial
television program. The board also decided to sue the program's
producer, Whittle Communications, of Knoxville, Tenn.
   The state board had voted to ban Channel One contracts signed
after Feb. 1, but Monday declared that all contracts for the news
show were void, even if they had been signed before the board
outlawed it. State officials said about 90 local schools had agreed
to show the program.
   Some local school officials criticized the moves, saying they
infringed on the prerogatives of local boards.
   The Thomasville school board set up Monday's confrontation on
Feb. 8 by signing a contract for the program, saying the state
board had exceeded its authority by banning the show.
   ``The issue speaks very directly to local control vs. state
control,'' Ronald B. Singletary, the Thomasville schools
superintendent, told The News and Observer of Raleigh.
   ``It's going to be very difficult for us to motivate teachers
and administrators to seriously look at options that are considered
non-traditional with this kind of presumption that if it hasn't
been used _ then don't use it,'' he said.
   Channel One offers a daily 12-minute news program, which
includes two minutes of advertising. The contract with Whittle
Communications requires schools to show the program to all students
each day. In exchange, the schools are loaned $50,000 worth of
video equipment for the length of the contract.
   The suit also charges that the Thomasville board exceeded its
authority by signing the contract, allowed students to be exploited
for commercial purposes, surrendered its control of classroom
materials to Whittle and violated state laws that guarantee the
privacy of students.
   The suit asks the court to bar Thomasville and any other local
school system from contracting or implementing a contract with
Whittle Communications.
   A statement from Whittle Communications said the company was
studying the state board's action.
   Thomasville school officials did not return phone calls seeking
reaction to the lawsuit.
   Whittle Communications announced in New York last Thursday it
had signed up 2,510 school nationally for Channel One and had sold
$200 million in advertising. The program is scheduled to debut
March 5.

   Appalachian coal miners' voted nearly 2-to-1
to ratify their contract with Pittston Coal Group, union officials
announced today. The vote ends a bitter 10-month strike that served
as a rallying point for the American labor movement.
   Pittston employees in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky voted
1,247 to 734 in favor of the pact. Sixty-three percent of the
striking miners and laid-off workers endorsed the contract and 37
percent opposed it, according to figures provided by the United
Mine Workers.
   The results were announced jointly in Virginia and in Bal
Harbor, Fla., where the AFL-CIO is holding its annual winter
meeting. UMW President Richard Trumka, AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland and U.S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole joined in the
Florida announcement.
   Mrs. Dole appointed the super mediator, former Labor Secretary
William Usery, who helped forge the tentative settlement announced
Jan. 1.
   Trumka called miners in Castlewood, Va., at about 9:15 a.m. to
tell them the strike was officially over. Kirkland and Mrs. Dole
joined in the call.
   Kirkland called the vote ``a happy conclusion to a long and very
gallant struggle.''
   He told the miners: ``Your example and your steadfastness and
your solidarity has been an inspiration to the entire trade union
movement, not just here but throughout the world. It's given us all
a lift and I want you to know we share your victory.''
   Mrs. Dole said it was a joyous day for the nation because the
ratification was ``an example of the success of the collective
bargaining process.''
   In Virginia, UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts told Pittston Coal
Group President Michael Odom of the results. ``That's fantastic
news,'' Odom said. ``I think the both of us can agree we've got a
worthy contract for employees, the union and the company.''
   It could be a week to 10 days before miners return to work since
mines must be re-inspected and workers have to go through training
courses, union officials said.
   Of the 1,310 miners voting in Virginia, 813, or 62 percent,
endorsed the contract while 497 workers, or 38 percent, opposed it.
   Of 479 workers voting in West Virginia, 339, or 71 percent,
favored the plan while 140, or 29 percent, were against it.
   The closest vote came in Kentucky, where 97 miners, or 50.5
percent, opposed the plan, while 95 workers, or 49.5 percent,
supported it.
   Rufus Hall, 56, said miners were concerned about the scheduling
flexibility in the new pact, but about nine out of 10 members of
his Virginia local voted for it.
   ``It's a pretty good package except for the swing shift,'' he
said.
   Under the tentative agreement, Pittston would continue to pay
100 percent of miners' health-care coverage, rather than forcing
them to take on 20 percent of those costs. Pittston also would
continue paying into an industry-wide pension fund from which it
had withdrawn.
   The company won the right to operate shifts around the clock and
to suspend 13 strikers accused of illegal strike activity and force
them to go to arbitration if they want to keep their jobs.
   The strike drew widespread support from labor unions and
religious leaders because of the use of peaceful civil disobedience
_ primarily mass sit-down demonstrations to block coal trucks _ and
because they believed Pittston was trying to break the union, a
claim the company vigorously denied.
   Last October, a delegation of international labor leaders,
including representatives of Poland's Solidarity trade union,
attended a rally of Pittston strikers in Russell County. Soviet
coal miners also toured the coalfields.
   Last summer, the walkout touched off wildcat sympathy strikes at
other coal companies that had settled with the UMW. At their peak,
those strikes affected tens of thousands of miners in much of the
East and Midwest.
   The Pittston strike's peaceful image was marred by sporadic
violence aimed at company property, supervisors and replacement
workers. Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin cited the
violence when he refused last week to drop $64 million in fines
against the union for illegal strike activities.
   Trumka said when the settlement was announced that the union
would withhold a rank-and-file vote until all litigation related to
the strike was dissolved. But he announced Thursday that the union
was going ahead with the vote, and the miners received copies of
the proposed contract Friday.

   The government will borrow $6 billion more
than previously announced during the January-March quarter to meet
the requirements of the savings and loan bailout, the Treasury
Department announced today.
   ``Treasury estimates that a total of $47.6 billion of market
borrowing will be required for the January-March period, including
the $34.4 billion that had been issued or announced through Friday,
Feb. 16,'' it said.
   The Treasury originally announced on Jan. 31 it would need to
borrow $41.6 billion.
   The additional funds will be obtained through regular auctions
of weekly three- and six-month bills and 52-week bills, the
Treasury said. Cash management bills also may be necessary to cover
low points in the cash balance, it said.
   ``The revision takes into account the most up-to-date estimate
of the Resolution Funding Corp.'s requirements to borrow from the
Federal Financing Bank through March 31,'' it said.
   The bank is a conduit for funneling Treasury money to government
agencies. The Resolution Funding Corp. was created in the thrift
bailout law as the financing arm of the Resolution Trust Corp.,
which actually disposes of the failed savings and loan institutions.
   The bailout legislation provides $50 billion through next year
to cover the losses in failed thrift institutions. But the trust
corporation needs to borrow as much as an additional $100 billion.
   The borrowing, called ``working capital,'' would be repaid as
the government sold loans, real estate and other assets inherited
from failed thrifts.

   The stock market declined broadly today,
yielding to renewed interest-rate worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 24.33 points to
2,611.26 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 186 up, 955 down and
376 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.89 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set by rising
interest rates in Japan and West Germany as U.S. traders came back
to work after the long Presidents Day weekend.
   American interest rates also moved up in today's early activity.
Prices of long-term government bonds dropped about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the 8.58
percent-8.62 percent range.
   Upward pressure on worldwide interest rates has been widely
cited as a primary force behind the stock market's poor start in
1990.
   For one thing, that development is seen as deterring the Federal
Reserve from stimulating the domestic economy to cushion the
effects of a slowdown in business activity.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped &rsqb; to

   Nordstrom was the volume leader among over-the-counter issues,
down 2 at 27{. on top of a 3\-point slide Friday.
   The company said its earnings for the fiscal year ended last
month were likely to show a decline. In addition, a state agency in
Washington that investigated Nordstrom's labor practices instructed
it to pay unspecified amounts in back wages.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
1.71 to 182.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.89 at 356.88.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 13.96 to
2,635.59, finishing the week with a net loss of 12.61 points.

<BYLINE>No Court Action Against `Pass-Through Certificates'
^By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to bar
national banks from selling mortgages in the form of ``pass-through
certificates'' _ a practice the securities industry says violates
federal banking law.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that such sales
are legal.
   Federal law allows national banks to sell the conventional real
estate mortgages they hold, but generally prohibits banks from
underwriting, buying and selling securities.
   Banks traditionally have sold longterm mortgages for other
revenue sources, and an increasingly popular means of selling
mortages is the use of pass-through certificates, which are
securities.
   The buyer of such a certificate obtains an interest in a pool of
the bank's conventional mortgages rather than a single mortgage.
   The California-based Security Pacific National Bank began
selling mortgage pass-through certificates in 1987, with a $194
million public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The Securities Industry Association, a group of more than 500
organizations that account for over 90 percent of the nation's
securities brokerage and investment banking business, asked federal
regulators about the validity of pass-through certificates.
   The comptroller of the currency concluded that Security
Pacific's pass-through certificate program was ``authorized under
the national banking laws,'' which he said ``does not restrict the
means by which national banks may sell or transfer interests in ...
their mortgages.''
   The comptroller's decision was in keeping with the recent trend
toward deregulation of the banking industry, with the courts and
federal regulators obliterating legal barriers between the banking
industry and other forms of commerce.
   After the comptroller's decision on Security Pacific's sales of
pass-through certificates, the Securities Industry Association sued
in federal court. The suit sought to stop what the association
asserted is the illegal sales of securities.
   U.S. District Judge Kevin Duffy of New York City ruled in 1988
that selling pass-through certificates amounted to underwriting
securities in violation of a 1933 federal banking law, the
Glass-Steagall Act.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last Sept. 8 reversed
Duffy's ruling and agreed with the comptroller of the currency.
   The appeals court said such sales constitute ``the business of
banking,'' and not the business of dealing in securities and stock.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Securities
Industry Association said the effect of the 2nd Circuit court's
ruling ``is to write Glass-Steagall right out of the statute
books.''
   In a ``friend-of-the-court'' brief supporting the appeal,
lawyers for the Investment Company Institute said the appeals court
ruling has allowed the underwriting of mortgage-backed securities
directly by national banks.
   ``The decision simply demolishes the Glass-Steagall Act,'' they
said.
   The Bush administration and lawyers for the Security Pacific
National Bank urged the court to reject the appeal.
   The case is Securities Industry Association vs. Clarke, 89-748.

   A new government report today estimated that
smoking costs the nation more than $52 billion a year, largely for
health care expenses.
   The report, by the Department of Health and Human Services,
estimated smoking-related disease averages $1 billion per state but
said some states pay a much higher price than others.
   California, the most populous state, has the highest costs, $5.8
billion. The economic cost is lowest in Alaska, where it is $82
million per year.
   ``I'm especially concerned that we make more progress in
reaching young people, women, minorities and blue-collar workers
with accurate and compelling information about smoking and its
devastating impact on their health,'' HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan
said in a statement accompanying the report.
   Presenting the report at a hearing by the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, Sullivan called on tobacco companies to stop
targeting women, minorities and young people.
   Sullivan, in written testimony, said that while Americans have a
personal responsibility to protect their health tobacco companies
and smoking advertisers must also be responsible.
   ``It is high time that we also stopped allowing smoking
advertisers such a high hand,'' he said. ``A cigarette is the only
legal product that, when used as intended, causes death.
Advertisers who disproportionately target women, minorities or
young Americans have gone too far. They must stop their
irresponsibility.''
   Sullivan also said advertising agency and the media should
question their involvement with tobacco companies. He said he hoped
to see them ``step forward to renounce tobacco ads and join in our
anti-smoking efforts.''
   Sullivan said the annual per-capita costs of smoking-related
disease was $221 nationally. He said that ranges from a low of $56
a person in Utah to $284 in Rhode Island.
   The cost comes out of the pockets of smokers and nonsmokers
alike, mostly in the forms of increased health care and insurance
costs, Sullivan said.
   Sullivan recently condemned R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for its
plans to market a cigarette targeted at blacks. Reynolds
subsequently dropped those plans, but it now intends to test-market
a cigarette called Dakota that news accounts said under one
proposal would be geared toward young women with a high school
education or less.
   Sullivan has been concerned about minorities because they have
higher rates of smoking than whites and they have a higher rate of
smoking-related disease and death.
   Smoking causes about 390,000 deaths in the united States and
about 29 percent of adults smoke, according to government
statistics.

<HEAD>Deere Reports Big Gain in First Quarter Earnings as Sales Soar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deere &amp; Co. on Tuesday reported a 62 percent
jump in quarterly earnings over the prior year, as sales in all
categories of tractors, combines and farm implements soared.
   For the company's first quarter, earnings rose to $78.5 million,
or $1.04 per share, on revenue of $1.64 billion. A year earlier
Deere earned $48.4 million, or 65 cents per share, on revenue of
$1.14 billion.
   The first-quarter report points to a possible third straight
year of record earnings for the Moline-based Deere.
   ``We expect the overall mix of our sales and production to be
more favorable in 1990 than in 1989,'' Deere &amp; Co. Chairman Robert
A. Hanson and President Hans W. Becherer said in a joint statement.
   Deere earned $380.2 million, or $5.06 a share, in the 1989
fiscal year, which ended Oct. 31. That was 20 percent more than the
previous record set in 1988 when Deere earned $315.4 million, or
$4.32 a share.
   Deere spokesman Robert Combs attributed the company's good
fortune to the recovery in the agricultural economy.
   ``A significant factor is the continued rebound of the North
American farm economy,'' Combs said. ``Farmers are coming off three
years of strong income. They have reduced debt and are using an
aging fleet of equipment. Now is the time for them to look at
replacing their tractors and combines.''
   Despite the huge profits and demand for Deere equipment, the
company's employment levels have not changed dramatically.
   Its workforce has increased by just 600 employees in the last
three months and now stands at 38,900.

   The stock market dropped sharply today as
traders grew increasingly concerned about the upward trend of
interest rates worldwide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 37.62 points at
noon EST to 2,597.97.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by almost 6 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 217 up,
1,229 down and 391 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 77.04 million shares as of noon.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set by rising
interest rates in Japan and West Germany as U.S. traders returned
after the long Presidents Day weekend.
   American interest rates also jumped today. Prices of long-term
government bonds dropped as much at $14 for each $1,000 in face
value, increasing their yields to the 8.64 percent-8.68 percent
range. In addition to rising overseas rates, traders said the bond
market was depressed by news that the Treasury raised its
first-quarter borrowing needs by $6 billion.
   Upward pressure on worldwide interest rates has been widely
cited as a primary force behind the stock market's poor performance
so far this year.
   For one thing, that development is seen as deterring the Federal
Reserve from stimulating the domestic economy to cushion the
effects of a slowdown in business activity.
   Testifying before a congressional panel today, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan said recent U.S. economic indicators are ``more
encouraging than otherwise.'' However, he said, there are
undercurrents in the economy such as lower corporate profits that
continue to warrant caution.
   One stock trader said the market was more concerned about
overseas interest rates than Greenspan's comments.
   ``The worry on Japan rates is really what is hurting us,'' said
Daniel Williams, head position trader for Dillon, Read &amp; Co. ``Most
of the foreign (stock) markets were off, and we're just following
suit.''
   In addition, Williams said, computerized program selling kicked
in at some Wall Street firms, further depressing share prices.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. on Tuesday said the sale
of its computer division to a French company is in dispute.
   The company also announced a 47 percent drop in fourth-quarter
profit from its consumer electronics business and a $17 million
loss for the full year.
   Zenith, the only major American manufacturer of color
televisions, reported results only for its consumer electronics and
components business.
   In a statement, the suburban Glenview-based company said results
for its Zenith Data Systems computer business were not yet
available because of a ``major dispute'' with the buyer, Groupe
Bull of France, over the final sale price.
   Zenith said the sale, which was announced in October, was
completed for $496.4 million in late December but that Groupe Bull
has since requested a refund of $49 million, plus interest,
apparently due to a disagreement over the value of the division's
assets.
   Zenith reported net income from continuing operations of $4
million, or 15 cents per common share, for the three months ended
Dec. 31 compared with $7.5 million, or 29 cents per share, for the
corresponding quarter a year earlier.
   Fourth quarter revenue from continuing operations rose slightly,
to $443 million from $440 million in 1988.
   For the full year, Zenith reported a net loss from continuing
operations of $17 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a net
loss of $11 million, or 42 cents a share, in 1988.
   Annual revenue from continuing operations rose 11 percent to
$1.5 billion from $1.4 billion in 1988.
   Zenith attributed the poor performance to higher material and
labor costs, which the company said offset the positive effects of
higher sales volume and efficiency improvements.

<HEAD>Stock Prices Fall Sharply Amid Interest Rate Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices declined broadly on Wall Street today as
the outlook dimmed for an easing of interest rates anytime soon.
   Rising interest rates on West German and Japanese markets set a
negative tone for stock trading and a surge in rates in the U.S.
Treasury bond market only worsened matters.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip industrials was down 47.53
to 2,588.06 as of 12:30 p.m. EST. On the broader market, declining
issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 6 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 217 stocks rising, 1,229 falling and 391
unchanged.
   NYSE volume came to 77.04 million shares at midday.
   Upward pressure on worldwide interest rates has been widely
cited as a primary force behind the stock market's poor start in
1990. When interest rates rise overseas, U.S. rates must move
upward to stay competitive.
   This trend has been seen as deterring the Federal Reserve from
stimulating the domestic economy by lowering rates.
   And it appeared today the Fed sees little need to boost the
economy. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress the economy has
likely passed the danger point for an imminent recession and he
predicted continued modest economic growth for the rest of 1990.
   Greenspan's comments contributed to a sharp drop on the Treasury
bond market, where the government's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled
1\ point, or about $12.50 per $1,000 face value, by midday. Its
yield, which goes up when its price falls, shot up to 8.63 percent
from 8.46 percent late Friday.
   Wall Street often reacts negatively when Treasury bond rates
advance.

   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said
today organized labor has an improved relationship with the Bush
administration despite the president's refusal to let government
intervene in the Eastern Airlines strike.
   ``I think it's clear that we have a positive relationship in
that they believe the door is open, that I want a continuing
dialogue, that the president does,'' Mrs. Dole said after meeting
privately with AFL-CIO leaders.
   ``I understand that there are issues where we'll have to agree
to disagree. Eastern is one of them. All right, so be it. We have
to agree to disagree there,'' she said.
   Again defending President Bush's veto of legislation that would
have created a panel to resolve the Eastern dispute, Mrs. Dole said
there had been no favoritism toward management.
   Some union officials contend that Bush unfairly sided with Frank
Lorenzo, head of Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent company. Labor
considers Lorenzo a union-buster who has refused to try to settle
the strike through arbitration.
   ``I feel Mr. Lorenzo's labor policies leave a lot to be
desired,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   The president was right to veto the legislation because
transportation was not disrupted in any region of the country
because of the strike, she said.
   ``Why are we arguing about it? I think it's clear,'' she said to
reporters.
   Union officials say Bush's attitude toward organized labor
appears to be a marked improvement from the Reagan era, but they
doubt there's been a substantive shift in policy.
   The administration deserves credit for its involvement in the
Pittston coal strike _ Mrs. Dole met with both sides and appointed
a ``super mediator'' _ and for compromising on labor's long-sought
hike in the minimum wage, union leaders said.
   But they also complain that Bush, while praising worker
movements abroad such as Solidarity in Poland, has demonstrated
``union busting'' tendencies at home with the Eastern veto.
   ``Our president seems to be saying, `Workers' rights are fine in
other parts of the world, but not in my backyard,''' said John
Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union.
   The Executive Council of the 4.1 million-member AFL-CIO hopes to
achieve improved relations with the Bush administration as its
33-member board meets today with Mrs. Dole.
   ``I give Bush and Liz Dole an A-plus on Pittston and a zero on
Eastern,'' said Joyce Miller, vice president of the Amalgamated
Colthing and Textile Workes Union.
   Many union officials considered Ronald Reagan, who fired
striking air traffic controllers in 1981 and effectively killed
that union, the worst president of the century for organized labor.
   ``President Bush and his `kinder, gentler' nation at least talks
about issues that affect workers, like education, child care and
health care. It took them long enough to come around on minimum
wage, so we'll see on the others,'' Sweeney said.
   Susan Cowell, vice president of the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union, said Bush has been forced to improve the climate
toward labor.
   ``Reagan created a revolution that was exposed as a fraud, and
the public tide has turned against it. Bush is almost forced to be
more moderate. That limits the degree to which he can hurt us,''
Cowell said.
   ``Bush is an odd character. He doesn't embrace an ideology the
way Reagan does, but it's hard to see a policy difference,'' she
said.
   Last year, Bush agreed to address the AFL-CIO's convention in
Washington, marking the first time a president had addressed the
federation since Jimmy Carter did in 1979. Reagan refused to speak
in 1981 and was never invited again.
   At the time, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, who a month
earlier had called Bush ``Reagan Lite,'' said the president's
willingness to strike a compromise on minimum wage showed their had
been some improvement over labor's strained relationship with
Reagan.
   On Monday, Kirkland said union leaders would continue to lobby
Congress for an override of Bush's veto of the Eastern Airlines
legislation.
   As expected, the federation's Executive Council skipped a vote
on pro-choice resolutions and instead appointed a 14-member
committee of union leaders to determine whether a stand should be
taken.
   Kirkland said the panel would not be swayed much by a national
Right to Life Committee letter-writing campaign that urged union
officials not to take a stand.
   ``I've been around a while, and I think I can tell grass roots
from AstroTurf,'' Kirkland said, insinuating the letters were not
from rank-and-file union members.
   The letters warned union leaders that rank-and-file members
opposed to abortion would likely seek to have part of their union
dues withheld if the AFL-CIO, which has sidestepped the issue for
more than a decade, adopted a pro-choice position.
   ``I do not think the committee will be moved by threats or
suggestions of reprisals. I think the committee will address the
issues fairly and rationally and on the merits and will act
accordingly,'' Kirkland said.
   National Right to Life Committee officials have said the AFL-CIO
should sit the issue out because it does not impact collective
bargaining or workplace conditions.
   Pro-choice union officials contend the issue impacts the
economic well-being of working women. They note the AFL-CIO has
traditionally taken a stand on a wide range of issues, including
civil rights, gay rights and school busing.
   ``I would say that the committee probably breaks down almost
50-50,'' said Miller, a pro-choice member of the abortion panel.
She predicted the AFL-CIO could adopt a pro-choice position as long
as it included language acknowledging the moral and religious views
of some union members.
   Kirkland declined to identify his personal position. The panel's
chairman, William Wynn, president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers International Union, is pro-choice but has said his
personal feelings would not influence the committee's decision.
   Kirkland did not give the panel a deadline, but pro-choice
officials want a decision by the council's May meeting. That would
let labor leaders use the issue when making endorsements for the
1990 elections.

   AmBase Corp. said Tuesday it was putting its
insurance operations up for sale, including its Home Insurance Co.
subsidiary, to help boost its stock price and repay debt.
   Home Insurance, which was founded in 1853, is AmBase's largest
insurance company with 2,000 agents and brokers nationwide and $2.3
billion in gross premiums written in 1989. Most of its premiums
were in commercial and specialty lines.
   Its other insurance units are U.S. International Re, a
reinsurance company with $207 million in gross premiums last year,
and Commonwealth Insurance Co. of Canada, with $120 million in
premiums.
   AmBase said it was selling its insurance operations because it
believed its stock price was significantly undervalued. It said it
hired First Boston Corp. to help seek bidders.
   ``Our recent share price does not fairly represent the inherent
value of our company,'' said President Marshall Manley. ``We have
very fine subsidiaries which are operating profitably.''
   AmBase shares have been trading over the past year at between
$7.37{ to $16.37{. By midday Tuesday, AmBase was up 62{ cents to $9
share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   AmBase said proceeds from the sales would be used to repay
outstanding debt.
   AmBase, which also has interests in banking and investment
services, had net income of $96 million, or $2.86 per share, in
1989.

   Prices sharply lower on London's Stock Exchange
Tuesday, pushed downward by weakness in the world's bond markets
and a big decline on Wall Street.
   Some bargain buying at early afternoon lifted prices to their
best levels of the day. However, the rally could not be sustained,
dealers said, especially after the sharp drop in the initial hours
of Wall Street trading.
   By the close of the European day, the Dow Jones industrial
average was off 44.14 points at 2,591.44.
   Market watchers said volume remained light, which indicated a
lack of outright selling and more of a drift lower.
   ``The market's decline is due to more selling than buying, but
there hasn't been much of either,'' one dealer said.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was down 20.1 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,277.0, just slightly
above its lowest point for the day of 2,276.4, and off from a
midafternoon peak of 2,290.8.
   Volume amounted to a light 374.7 million shares, compared with
314.3 million shares Monday.

<TEXT>
   The Quaker Oats Co. has no
immediate plans to sell its Fisher-Price toy company, but has not
ruled out a sale in the future, the Quaker chairman said.
   William Smithburg, speaking at a meeting in Fort Lauderdale,
said Quaker is working aggressively to turn around the depressed
profits of the toy unit by fiscal 1991.
   But he told a group of securities industry analysts here Monday
the company only will be marginally profitable in the second half
of fiscal 1990.
   Fisher-Price's market share in younger children's toys has
dropped in the last year from 10 percent to the high 8 percent
range, said Paul Price, Quaker's senior vice president of finance
and new president of the division.
   Some analysts have predicted that the company could bring as
much as $700 million to $800 million if the company were turned
around.
   ``We will examine all, and I mean all, options regarding
Fisher-Price,'' Smithburg said.
   That comment was a nod to analysts meeting here, many of whom
have said that Quaker should get away from the volatile toy
business.
   ``Quaker used to say `No, Fisher-Price is not for sale.' Now at
least they say they are thinking about it,'' said John McMillan, an
analyst for Prudential Bache Securities.
   As previously reported for the six months that ended Dec. 31,
Fisher-Price reported operating income of $19 million, down 63
percent from the same time a year before. Quaker blames production
delays and a poor mix of toys.
   But Smithburg said Fisher-Price is still the leader in the
pre-school toy business and noted ``we are setting a pattern for a
sizable turnaround in 1991 and into 1992.''

<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today the economy has likely passed the danger point for an
imminent recession and he predicted continued, although modest,
economic growth for the rest of this year.
   Greenspan said the central bank expects the economy to grow far
more sluggishly this year than the Bush administration predicts.
That scenario could dash the administration's hopes of making
significant progress on reducing the federal budget deficit.
   Greenspan commented in an annual appearance before Congress to
reveal the bank's all-important monetary and economic growth
targets for the new year.
   The testimony bolstered the belief among many private economists
that the Federal Reserve Board is not likely to move soon to push
interest rates lower.
   Following Greenspan's testimony, prices tumbled in the stock and
bond markets in midday trading that analysts said reflected
investor worries about rising interest rates worldwide.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks
was down 42.57 points to 2,593.02 at 2 p.m. EST. In the credit
markets, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond was off by about
$12.50 per $1,000 in face value, with its yield rising to 8.63
percent from 8.46 percent late Friday.
   Greenspan emphasized a belief that the economy appears to be
rebounding from an extremely sluggish October-December period while
at the same time inflationary pressures remain at unacceptable
levels.
   The Fed chairman cited a string of recent economic reports
showing a rebound in economic activity in January, ranging from
rising auto sales to a big jump in housing construction.
   ``From these and similar data, one can infer the beginnings of a
modest firming in economic activity,'' Greenspan told a House
Banking subcommittee.
   ``While we cannot be certain that we are as yet out of the
recessionary woods, such evidence warrants at least guarded
optimism,'' he said. ``... Available indicators of near-term
economic performance suggest that the weakest point may have
passed.''
   Greenspan's testimony served to reaffirm statements he made
three weeks ago in another congressional appearance.
   The Fed's economic forecast showed that the central bank is
looking for the economy, as measured by the gross national product,
to grow at an anemic rate of between 1.75 percent and 2 percent
this year.
   That is far below the administration's projection that the
economy will grow by 2.6 percent this year, when measured from the
fourth quarter of 1989.
   The administration is pinning its hopes of cutting the federal
budget deficit in half on a belief that economic growth will
rebound significantly in 1990 from the depressed level in the
fourth quarter, when the GNP rose at an annual rate of just 0.5
percent, its poorest showing in 3{ years.
   But if as appears likely, the Fed pursues a tighter credit
policy to dampen inflationary pressures, then interest rates will
be higher than the administration is forecasting and growth will be
slower _ two developments that will add billions of dollars to the
budget deficit.
   The Fed's economic forecast for 1990 represented only a modest
change from a preliminary estimate the central bank made last June
when it forecast growth of 1.5 percent to 2 percent.
   However, the Fed substantially lowered its inflation estimate to
4 percent to 4.5 percent for consumer prices, down from a June
forecast of 4.5 percent to 5 percent, signaling perhaps a renewed
emphasis on getting prices lower.
   Greenspan said that while consumer prices for January, scheduled
to be reported Wednesday, would show a sizable jump due to energy
and food costs, a reversal of this temporary spurt ``is apparently
under way.''
   ``The ultimate objective of economic policy is to foster the
maximum sustainable rate of economic growth,'' Greenspan said,
adding that ``inflation insidiously undermines'' business and
consumer confidence in the economy's future course.
   Greenspan's testimony tracked the expectations of many
economists, who believe that the Fed is succeeding in attempts to
engineer a ``soft landing'' for the economy in which growth slows
enough to dampen inflation but not enough to end the 7-year-long
economic recovery.
   But analysts said Greenspan's testimony sets the stage for a
possible clash between the administration's optimistic economic
goals and a Fed intent on keeping a damper on growth to make sure
that inflation does not get out of hand.
   ``The public comments from the administration will be coming hot
and heavy later on this year as Bush officials try to nudge the Fed
into an easier stance,'' predicted David Jones, chief economist of
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer.
   Economists said a spurt in prices at the beginning of the year,
caused in large part by unusually cold weather which pushed up food
costs, also was working against lower interest rates.
   ``The Fed does not want to be perceived as easing at a time when
inflation is accelerating, even if those inflationary pressures
were considered to be temporary,'' Jones said.

   The stock market dropped sharply today as
traders grew increasingly concerned about the upward trend of
interest rates worldwide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 42.57 points at
2 p.m. EST to 2,593.02.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 244 up, 1,303 down
and 368 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 111.39 million shares as of 2
p.m.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set by rising
interest rates in Japan and West Germany as U.S. traders returned
after the long Presidents Day weekend.
   U.S. interest rates followed suit today, rising sharply. Prices
of long-term government bonds plunged as much at $18 for each
$1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the 8.67
percent-8.72 percent range. In addition to higher overseas rates,
traders said the bond market was depressed by news that the
Treasury raised its first-quarter borrowing needs by $6 billion.
   Upward pressure on worldwide interest rates has been widely
cited as a primary force behind the stock market's poor performance
so far this year.
   The higher rates are seen as deterring the Federal Reserve from
stimulating the domestic economy to counter the effects of a
slowdown in business activity.
   Testifying before a congressional panel today, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan said recent U.S. economic indicators are ``more
encouraging than otherwise.'' Analysts interpreted his remarks to
mean the Fed would not push rates lower any time soon.
   One stock trader said the market was more concerned about
interest rates than Greenspan's comments.
   ``The worry on Japan rates is really what is hurting us,'' said
Daniel Williams, head position trader for Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped } to
37{, General Electric lost ~ to 61&lsqb;, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
dropped 1 to 38} and IBM lost 1&lsqb; to 102&rsqb;.
   Nordstrom, among the most active stocks in the over-the-counter
market, was down 2\ at 27\, compounding a 3\-point slide Friday.
   The department store operator said its earnings for the fiscal
year ended last month were likely to show a decline. In addition, a
state agency in Washington that investigated Nordstrom's labor
practices instructed it to pay unspecified amounts in back wages.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
2.89 to 180.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 4.23 at 354.54.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The symbolic collapse of the Berlin Wall opened a
door of opportunity that attracted a big flow of Japanese
investment to the West German stock exchange, helping not only to
fuel a market boom but also raising speculation of a big slump once
the money dries up.
   According to the Securities Dealers Association of Japan,
Japanese investors increased the amount of their holdings of West
German stocks to $944 million worth by the end of 1989, about 2{
times the amount of a year earlier.
   ``The amount of Japanese investments have been growing nowhere
else but in West German stocks,'' said Kazumasa Funaoka, an
association spokesman.
   Helping attract the investment is speculation that Eastern bloc
liberalization and weakening East-West tensions will mean big
moneymaking opportunities for West German companies in coming years.
   Relatively weak performances in other major stock markets also
have made the Frankfurt exchange look attractive.
   The West German market's main indicator, the 100-issue FAZ
index, has soared some 20 percent in the last three months. In
contrast, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 5 percent, and the New York's 30-issue Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose only 1.5 percent.
   Five West German issues listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange _
Commerzbank AG, Bayer AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Dresdner Bank AG, and
Volkswagen _ also have posted strong gains.
   Kenji Maeshiro, an analyst with Yamaichi Securities, Co., said
the Japanese investment boom in West German market is based on
expectations of stability in the West German economy and growth of
the Frankfurt stock exchange.
   Japanese investors also are seeking a foothold ahead of the
European Community's 1992 integration, as well as access to the
newly opening Eastern bloc economies.
   Daiwa Securities, Co., is sending additional staffers from Tokyo
to its Frankfurt subsidiary. Daiwa also has introduced a
Europe-oriented fund for individual investors, its second since
November, said Daiwa spokesman Yoshihiko Azuma.
   Giant Nomura Securities also recently introduced its first
``German Fund.'' Similar funds have been traded in the United
States and Europe.
   Stock investors' increasing demand for the West German mark has
strengthened the currency, analysts said. The mark, which is
trading at around 80 yen or $1.67, has gained 20 percent against
those two currencies since November.
   The investing power comes from Japan's abundant foreign exchange
reserves, the rising value of the yen and substantial capital
savings.
   Maeshiro said the Tokyo stock market's recent slowdown helped
accelerate the German boom, as investors moved to an arena with
greater returns.
   That in turn has made it more difficult to revive the Tokyo
market, ``because market players are buying stocks in the West
German market, not here,'' said one Nomura dealer, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   As stock prices continue rising more on speculation than on
economic fundamentals, some analysts have been expressing concern
that a massive inflow of Japanese money may overheat the West
German market, which is only about one-tenth the size of the Tokyo
market.
   Price increases under such conditions make the market
vulnerable, Maeshiro said. ``The market's uptrend can be easily
reversed once negative news comes out.''
   But Finance Ministry spokesman Yoshikazu Sakai said Japanese
investment would not be so influential as to damage the Frankfurt
market. The market will correct itself as more investors worry
about the speed of price increases and start cashing in their
gains, Sakai said.
   ``We don't see Japanese investment there as a possible cause of
economic problems in Japan and West Germany,'' he said.
   But Sakai said the boom could be temporary. ``Look at Spain
funds and Southeast Asian funds, which investors used to be crazy
about. These funds no longer attract them,'' he said. ``Who knows
if West German funds are going to be like those?''

   President Bush welcomed Czechoslovak President
Vaclav Havel to the White House today, promising trade rewards for
Prague's moves toward democracy and assuring him ``the United
States will be part of your nation's rebirth.''
   Bush cautioned, however, that troops of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ``will continue to play vital role in assuring
stability and security in Europe,'' and that ``America will
continue to play its part, including a strong military presence for
our security and for Europe's.''
   Some Czechoslovak leaders have called for eventual dissolution
of NATO, along with the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led alliance to
which Czechoslovakia belongs.
   However, a U.S. official who briefed reporters on the
presidents' talks said Havel agreed that NATO troops were needed
until European nations could provide their own security.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Havel
believed that ``until new security structures emerge ... the
requirement for NATO and the continued U.S. presence would endure.''
   Havel, a former dissident playwright who spent five years in
prison, was the first of Eastern Europe's new reform leaders to
visit the White House.
   After their meeting, Bush hailed Havel as ``one of the heroes of
the revolution of '89,'' a year that saw the old hardline communist
government peacefully replaced by the reformers who put Havel into
the presidency.
   ``Your life is a tribute to the difference one man can make,''
Bush told him in a departure speech.
   Bush announced his intention to waive the so-called
Jackson-Vanik restrictions on trade relations with communist
governments as U.S. and Czechoslovak representatives begin
negotiations on a new trade agreement with a goal of giving Prague
most-favored-nation status as a preferred trading partner.
   Granting Czechoslovakia such status _ extending to it the same
low tariffs available to the nation's best trading partners _ is
contingent on the Czechoslovak Parliament passing a law ending the
former communist government's restrictive emigration policies.
   Congress then would would be asked to grant most-favored-nation
status.
   Bush said he would also send Peace Corps volunteers to
Czechoslovakia by the end of summer.
   Havel, in brief remarks, said his talks with Bush had been
``very important negotiations,'' and that he was happy to have
``the opportunity to be here to explain what happened in
Czechoslovakia.''
   Discussing his visit in a television interview before the White
House meeting, Havel said:
   ``Above all, I want to inform the Americans about what happened
in our country, what are the international consequences of it, what
is our foreign policy, what it will be. And I want to lay
foundations for a real, authentic friendship between our two
nations.''
   ``We are also interested in trade relations,'' he said on NBC's
``Today'' show.
   After his television appearance, Havel went to Georgetown
University, where he spent nearly an hour answering questions from
students through an interpreter. He drew laughter at one point when
he said, ``There no longer are any dissidents (in Czechoslovakia).
If there are, they are in government or other high positions.''
   Havel also said that his government is ``facing a difficult task
of changing'' the economy and has removed all controls on freedom
of speech.
   And Havel said he has no fears about German reunification so
long as the new country is a democracy. ``I wouldn't be afraid of a
democratic country if it had 100 million people, but I would be
afraid of a totalitarian country with a million people,'' he said.
   Havel's visit comes as relations are fast warming between Prague
and Washington.
   ``Our relationship has been sort of frozen with the communist
government,'' whose fall led to Havel's Dec. 29 installation as
president, said a senior administration official who briefed White
House reporters about the visit. ``And we're now able to warm it
up, I think, rather naturally and quickly.''
   Havel arrived in Washington on Monday evening after stops in
Iceland and Canada in the week before his first trip to Moscow.
Besides his private visit with Bush in the Oval Office, he met with
top Bush advisers and was guest at a White House lunch.
   Havel is not expected to seek an economic handout from
Washington, but rather focus on Czechoslovakia's role in the future
of Europe and international financial institutions, said the
administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Havel's country is on much firmer economic footing than its
neighbors, Poland and Hungary.
   ``What they want is mainly language help,'' said Shirley Temple
Black, the U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia, who accompanied Havel
on the helicopter trip from Andrews Air Force Base to Washington.
``They want to know about managing ... They didn't come for the
money,'' she said.
   After arriving, Havel spent about 15 minutes in a ``very
cordial'' meeting at Blair House with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, said Havel's press secretary, Michael Zantovsky.
   ``We are not going to the United States to beg for big economic
aid or loans or something similar,'' Havel told The New York Times
in an interview before he left Prague. ``We are going to learn from
a democratic system like the one we enjoyed for only so brief a
period, only 20 years and lost. We can learn from American
democracy. We can learn from a highly industrialized country, a
highly developed education system and universities _ from many
spheres that can serve as examples to us.''
   On Wednesday, Havel speaks before a joint session of Congress
before heading to New York for business, political and cultural
meetings.
   In New York, he also will be feted by a rock concert in his
honor before heading home Thursday night.
   Havel was elected by the Czechoslovak Parliament a few weeks
after a peaceful revolution ousted the hardline government of
Communist Party chief Milos Jakes.
   The country's first parliamentary elections in more than four
decades are planned for June 8.
   Havel, 53, who has said he is more interested in being a writer
than president, is popular among his countrymen and has not
announced whether he will seek election in June.
   Havel's government has insisted the Soviet Union withdraw its
73,500 troops as quickly as possible and favors eventual
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. Some Czechoslovak officials also
have urged that NATO be phased out, something the Bush
administration strongly opposes.

<HEAD>Crop Futures End Mostly Lower In Stock Market Reaction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting pronounced
weakness in the stock and bond markets.
   Prospects for beneficial precipitation in U.S. and South
American crop regions also prompted selling but the main influence
was ``this malaise in the financial markets,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a grain futures trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
in Chicago.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell more than 40 points
before noon EST on the New York Stock Exchange amid dimming hopes
for lower interest rates after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan predicted the economy would grow much more slowly this
year than the Bush administration has predicted.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released weekly
grain export inspections totals that were better than expected for
wheat and soybeans and about as expected for corn.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 1} cents to 2{ cents
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $3.82\ a bushel;
corn futures were unchanged to } cent higher with March at $2.41\ a

   The stock market dropped sharply today as an
upward trend in worldwide interest rates troubled traders, analysts
said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 38.07 points at
3 p.m. EST to 2,597.52.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 266 up, 1,308 down
and 367 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.8 million shares as of 3 p.m.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set by rising
interest rates in Japan and West Germany as U.S. traders returned
after the long Presidents Day weekend.
   U.S. interest rates followed suit today, rising sharply. Prices
of long-term government bonds plunged as much at $18 for each
$1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the 8.65
percent-8.72 percent range. In addition to higher overseas rates,
traders said the bond market was depressed by news that the
Treasury raised its first-quarter borrowing needs by $6 billion.
   Upward pressure on worldwide interest rates has been widely
cited as a primary force behind the stock market's poor performance
so far this year.
   The higher rates are seen as deterring the Federal Reserve from
stimulating the domestic economy to counter the effects of a
slowdown in business activity.
   Testifying before a congressional panel today, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan said recent U.S. economic indicators are ``more
encouraging than otherwise.'' Analysts interpreted his remarks to
mean the Fed would not push rates lower any time soon.
   One stock trader said the market was more concerned about
interest rates than Greenspan's comments.
   ``The worry on Japan rates is really what is hurting us,'' said
Daniel Williams, head position trader for Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped { to
37}, General Electric lost 1 to 61, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
dropped } to 39, IBM lost } to 102}, and America Express lost { to
28{.
   Nordstrom, among the most active stocks in the over-the-counter
market, was down 1} at 27}, compounding a 3\-point slide Friday.
   The department store operator said its earnings for the fiscal
year ended last month were likely to show a decline. In addition, a
state agency in Washington that investigated Nordstrom's labor
practices instructed it to pay unspecified amounts in back wages.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
2.56 to 181.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 4.24 at 354.53.

   Source Perrier SA said Tuesday that new shipments
of its Perrier brand sparkling water will arrive on French shelves
March 1 bearing a special label showing they were bottled after
last week's worldwide recall.
   In a telex to its domestic distributors, Source Perrier also
said its representatives would visit distributors within the next
week to collect bottles withdrawn from sale.
   Perrier representatives at the company's headquarters were
unavailable to say when the popular water might return to the
United States and other foreign markets.
   When the worldwide recall was announced Feb. 14, company
executives said it may take 2{ months to withdraw 160 million
bottles from sale in 120 countries and replace them with water
untainted with the cancer-causing chemical benzene.
   Traces of benzene have been discovered in Perrier samples in
several countries, including the United States, where 72 million
bottles have been pulled off the shelves.
   Benzene entered Perrier's bottling line at Vergeze in southern
France when workers failed to replace a filter that carries carbon
dioxide gas from the underground spring to the plant, executives
said. The benzene occurs naturally, they said.
   The recall operation is expected to cost the company about $200
million.

<HEAD>Appliance Giant Says 1989 Profits Up 16.1 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New European business and better
profit margins on North American sales boosted Whirlpool Corp.'s
fourth-quarter earnings nearly 21 percent, the appliance
manufacturer said Tuesday.
   Whirlpool said earned $49.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $12 million, or
17 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   The year-earlier period included a $45 million loss on the sale
of Whirlpool's kitchen cabinet business.
   The company's 1989 fourth-quarter results include $9.2 million
in writedowns connection with Whirlpool's plans to close its Mount
Sterling, Ky., plant.
   Revenue totaled $1.57 billion, up from $1.02 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1988, the company said.
   For the year, Whirlpool said it earned $187.2 million, or $2.70
a share, on revenue of $6.29 billion, up from $94.1 million, or
$1.36 a share, on revenue of $4.42 billion, in in 1988.
   Whirlpool became the world's largest appliance concern with the
January 1989 acquisition of a $470 million stake in the appliance
division of Dutch electronics giant NV Philips.
   In line with the agreement, the company said 1989 results
included all of the revenue of the joint venture, Whirlpool
International BV, and 53 percent of its net earnings.
   Whirlpool International's performance and strong sales in North
America helped boost earnings, the company said. However, these
gains were offset by several factors, including higher interest
expense and taxes, Whirlpool said.
   David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool chairman and chief executive
officer, predicted flat sales to come and said wage cuts accepted
by Whirlpool workers in Evansville, Ind., would help keep costs
competitive.
   Whitwam predicted appliance sales would be down slightly in the
first half of 1990, possibly rallying in the second half of the
year.

<HEAD>Pittston Miners Ratify Contract, `Rejuvenate' Labor Movement</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 14th, ``I think...'' to UPDATE with
comment from Pittston news conference.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Appalachian miners ratified a contract
with Pittston Coal Group after striking for nearly 11 months and
were credited by labor leaders Tuesday with helping to rejuvenate
the trade union movement.
   Striking and laid-off United Mine Workers from Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky voted 1,247 to 734 Monday to accept a
contract nearly identical to a national UMW agreement that Pittston
broke away from in May 1987.
   ``This is a victory for all workers,'' UMW Vice President Cecil
Roberts told about 50 striking miners in announcing the results
Tuesday at a union office here.
   The settlement ends a strike punctuated by violence, sit-down
strikes and other tactics that resulted in millions of dollars in
fines against the union.
   It could be a week to 10 days before the 1,700 active miners
return to work, because mines must be re-inspected and workers must
go through training courses, officials said.
   UMW members across the country had viewed Pittston as a maverick
company attempting to break the union, a claim the company
vigorously denied. The union also felt other companies would copy
Pittston's tactics if it won concessions.
   The miners got job security and health and retirement provisions
they sought but gave up the traditional five-day work week
contained in the 1988 Bituminous Coal Operators Association
contract signed by most other producers. That means Pittston won
the right to operate around the clock, with voluntary labor on
Sundays, a day the miners traditionally have not worked.
   ``Pittston set out to try to break our union and they didn't
succeed,'' James Hall, a 57-year-old striking miner from St. Paul,
said at a rally. ``It's a victory, no doubt about that.''
   UMW President Richard Trumka, Treasurer John Banovic, AFL-CIO
President Lane Kirkland and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
congratulated the miners in telephone calls from the AFL-CIO
convention in Miami.
   ``You rejuvenated the labor movement throughout the world with
this strike,'' Banovic said. Kirkland called the strike a ``gallant
struggle that was an inspiration to the entire trade union
movement.''
   Dole, who intervened in the strike to appoint former labor
secretary William Usery to mediate a settlement, called the pact an
example of successful collective bargaining.
   ``It's a joyous day for everybody _ for the miners who are going
back to work, for the families who will be getting a steady
paycheck and certainly for the company, which will be going back to
full production,'' Dole told the strikers.
   During his news conference, Roberts called Pittston President
Michael Odom to tell him the contract was ratified. ``You have been
a worthy adversary,'' he told Odom. ``We're hoping to work just as
hard together now.''
   ``I think the both of us can agree we've got a worthy contract
for employees, the union and the company,'' Odom said.
   Odom said at an afternoon news conference that some miners will
be back on their jobs as early as Thursday and most will be back to
work next week.
   UMW members worked 14 months without a contract before the union
struck on April 5, 1989.
   UMW officials persuaded members and leaders of other unions that
the labor movement desperately needed a victory in the Pittston
dispute, and hundreds of thousands of union members converged on
the southwestern Virginia coalfields to show their support. To
further show sympathy, nearly 46,000 UMW members from Appalachia
and the Midwest went on short wildcat strikes last summer.
   ``We all learned some lessons from this strike; it's better to
talk than to fight,'' Roberts said. ``I hope we can bring peace
back to the coalfields of southwest Virginia. We're going to go
about the business now of mining coal.''
   Arthur Mabry, 60, of Lebanon, said he's glad to be going back to
work. ``We're going to try to work the best we can with the company
and hopefully overcome the hard feelings,'' he said.
   The UMW leadership will turn its attention to Circuit Judge
Donald McGlothlin, who rejected a request by union and company
attorneys to drop $64 million in strike-related fines against the
UMW. The judge gave them until Thursday to try to change his mind.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Tuesday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.6 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.80 percent, up from 7.65 percent
last week. Another $7.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.77 percent, also up from 7.65 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.83
percent on Feb. 5, and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent on
Oct. 2, 1989.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.07 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,802.80 and 8.20 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,607.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.05
percent last week, down from 8.13 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Supreme Court To Consider Regulation of Self-Funded Health Care
Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Tuesday it will decide
whether self-funded employee health care plans, which cover some
9.5 million Americans, are subject to state insurance laws and
regulations.
   The justices said they will use the case of a seriously injured
Pennsylvania teen-age girl to decide whether federal regulation of
such plans pre-empts any state regulation. A decision is expected
sometime in 1991.
   Self-funded plans are those in which all benefits are paid
directly by an employer, and not purchased through an independent
insurance company.
   The Illinois-based FMC Corp. has such a plan for its employees
and their dependents, and that plan paid for a substantial part of
the more than $178,000 in medical expenses incurred by Cynthia Ann
Holliday since a January 1987 automobile accident in Indiana
County, Pa.
   Miss Holliday, then 15, suffered permanent injuries when the car
in which she was a passenger crashed.
   Her father, Gerald, is an FMC employee.
   Holliday sued the car's driver, Robert Lyons, in state court.
Under a September 1987 settlement, Miss Holliday's recovery was
limited to $49,875.50 plus interest.
   When FMC sought to recover some of its expenses by claiming the
lawsuit settlement funds, Holliday successfully invoked a
Pennsylvania law that prohibits such action.
   FMC then turned to a federal trial judge for help, contending
that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)
was meant to be a sole means of regulating self-funded health plans
and that it therefore pre-empts the prohibitive Pennsylvania law.
   The judge, upheld by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last
Sept. 11, ruled that state regulation of self-funded health care
plans is not pre-empted by ERISA.
   FMC's appeal was supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the
Self-Insurance Institute of America and numerous self-funded health
and welfare plans.
   The case is FMC Corp. vs. Holliday, 89-1048.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Lower, Gold Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly lower in moderate
trading Tuesday but the British pound took center stage in foreign
exchange, reaching a 10-month high against the U.S. currency here
and abroad.
   Gold prices rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold
bullion for current delivery settled at $419.90 a troy ounce, $2.80
higher than Friday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a
late bid for gold at $419.90 an ounce, up $2.65 from Friday.
   The U.S. financial markets were closed on Monday in observance
of Presidents Day.
   Foreign exchange dealers said concerns about higher interest
rates abroad, particularly in Britain, West Germany and Japan, were
largely responsible for the dollar's drop.
   They said comments from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan before Congress Tuesday, although bullish for the dollar,
were shrugged off by traders. Greenspan expressed guarded optimism
that the country can avoid a recession this year, thereby
decreasing prospects for lower U.S. interest rates.
   Higher interest rates in Britain _ around 15 percent for bank
lending _ helped support sterling.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7040 late Tuesday, up from
$1.7030. Sterling fetched $1.7115 in New York, up from $1.6972
Friday.
   The pound is now at its highest level since the end of April
1989 in both the London and the United States, traders said.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.66835 West German marks, down from 1.6758;
1.4785 Swiss francs, down from 1.4910; 5.6670 French francs, down
from 5.6950; 1,237.50 Italian lire, down from 1,243.25; and 1.20075
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1998. Late dollar rates in Europe
compared with Monday: 1.6748 West German marks, down from 1.6765;
1.4865 Swiss francs, down from 1.4885; 5.6875 French francs, down
from 5.6955; 1.8845 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8870; 1,243.00
Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.2014 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1993.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar firmed to 144.58 Japanese yen from
Monday's 144.52. The dollar traded at 145.40 yen in London, and at
145.155 yen in New York, up from 144.13 Friday.
   Gold closed at $419.75 an ounce in London, up from $416.50 late
Monday, and at $419.75 an ounce in Zurich, up from $416.60.
   European prices had peaked at $421.25 but fell back on
profit-taking.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $419.85 an ounce, up from
$417.65.
   Silver prices gained. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.332 a troy ounce, up from $5.328
Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.35 an ounce from $5.33.

<HEAD>Honda Third-Quarter Earnings Slip 7.8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s earnings fell 7.8 percent in
the third quarter due largely to foreign-exchange losses and higher
interest costs, the company said Tuesday.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, Honda's net income fell to
22.5 billion yen, or $156 million, from 24.4 billion yen in the
year-ago period. Per-share income totaled 23.15 yen, or 16 cents,
down from 24.78 yen.
   Revenue rose 8.5 percent to 942.8 billion yen, or $6.5 billion,
from 868.7 billion yen. It was the highest net revenue ever
recorded by Honda for a three-month period, the company said.
   Honda said third quarter earnings recovered from the first two
quarters despite a general slowdown in the North American
automobile market and capital outlays to expand manufacturing
plants in the United States and in Japan.
   The company attributed the lower results to increased
non-operating expenses, including foreign exchange losses and
interest expenses.
   For the first nine months, net income totaled 55.2 billion yen,
or 56.57 yen a share, down 24.4 percent from 72.97 billion yen, or
73.84 yen a share.
   Sales in the first nine months reached 2.8 trillion yen, or
$19.1 billion, up 5.8 percent from 2.6 trillion yen in the same
period a year ago.
   Honda said increased auto sales, cost cutting and a weaker yen
contributed to increased net sales and operating income in the
nine-month period.

<HEAD>Deal Struck Between Eurotunnel, Banks to Free Up Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eurotunnel announced late Tuesday that a deal has
been struck with the Anglo-French contracting consortium building
the Channel Tunnel, defusing a financial crisis threatening to
derail the project.
   The agreement allows the parent company to draw on new loans
granted by creditor banks and comply with a court order to pay
Trans-Manche Link (TML) some $114 million, the company said.
   The press statement announcing the deal said further details of
the agreement would be made public Wednesday.
   Eurotunnel and the contractors began intense talks Monday around
TML's refusal to sign a financing aggreement reached January with
creditors that would have tided the project over until May.
   The scheme would have allowed Eurotunnel to draw upon $701
million from the $8.7 billion in new loans granted to the venture.
   TML was reported to be unhappy with management reshuffling last
Thursday making Alastair Morton the project's chief executive, with
contractors disliking his management style and criticism of cost
overruns.
   Eurotunnel refused to confirm reports in the British press that
the crisis had been resolved Monday with the appointment of John
Neerhaut, vice president of the Bechtel group, to control
day-to-day operations of the project.
   The tunnel, being built from both sides, is due to be opened in
mid-1993 to rail traffic. About a third of the tunneling on the
34-mile project is complete.

   The stock market dropped sharply Tuesday as an
upward trend in worldwide interest rates troubled traders.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 38.74 points to
close at 2,596.85. At one point during trading the widely watched
barometer was down nearly 50 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
327 up, 1,257 down and 388 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 147.30 million shares, down from 166.84
million in Friday's session. The market was closed Monday for
Presidents Day.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 174.97 million shares.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set by rising
interest rates in Japan and West Germany as U.S. traders returned
after the three-day weekend.
   U.S. interest rates followed the trend, rising sharply. Prices
of long-term government bonds plunged as much at $16 for each
$1,000 in face value, increasing their yields to the 8.66
percent-8.70 percent range.
   Besides higher overseas rates, traders said the bond market was
depressed by news that the Treasury raised its first-quarter
borrowing needs by $6 billion.
   Upward pressure on worldwide interest rates has been widely
cited as a primary force behind the stock market's poor performance
so far this year. Higher rates make interest-bearing investments
more attractive than stocks and deter the Federal Reserve from
stimulating the domestic economy.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress Tuesday that recent
U.S. economic indicators are ``more encouraging than otherwise.''
Analysts interpreted his remarks to mean the Fed would not push
rates lower any time soon.
   One stock trader said the market was more concerned about
interest rates abroad than Greenspan's comments.
   ``The worry on Japan rates is really what is hurting us,'' said
Daniel Williams at Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   In addition, Williams said, computerized selling programs at
some Wall Street firms further depressed prices.
   Phil Rettew, a senior market specialist with Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., said the market has been poised for a selloff.
   ``I think that the worldwide decline in bond prices was just a
little banana peel on the edge of the cliff,'' he said.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped { to
37}, General Electric lost 1&lsqb; to 60~, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph dropped } to 39, IBM lost | to 102~, and America Express
lost } to 28\.
   Great Northern Nekoosa was the most active NYSE issue, jumping
1{ to 65&rsqb; on news the company agreed to a buyout offer from
Georgia-Pacific at $65.75 a share, up from Georgia-Pacific's
original $63-a-share bid.
   Nordstrom, among the most active stocks in the over-the-counter
market, was down 1} at 27}, compounding a 3\-point slide Friday.
   The department store operator said earnings for the fiscal year
ended last month were likely to show a decline. In addition, a
Washington state agency ordered Nordstrom to pay unspecified
amounts in back wages.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market totaled $3,174.667 billion
Tuesday, off $41.011 billion or 1.28 percent from Friday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks lost 2.38
to 181.37. Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 5.15 to close at
378.66, and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 4.73 to close at
327.99.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
5.18 to close at 423.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 3.89 to 354.88.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Surge Amid Physical Buying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices surged to new 2{-month highs Tuesday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting strong demand for the
metal amid uncertainty about inflation, stock prices and South
Africa.
   On other major commodity markets, copper futures rose; energy
futures were mixed; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and
grains and soybeans were mostly lower.
   Platinum futures settled $8.40 to $9 higher with the contract
for delivery in April up $9 at $534.40 a troy ounce, its highest
daily finish since Nov. 27.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures finished $2.80 to
$3.70 higher with February at $419.90 a troy ounce; silver ended
0.3 cent to 1.4 cents higher with March at $5.343 a troy ounce.
   Analysts linked the platinum rally to a spurt in purchases of
physical platinum in the Far East and to renewed investment demand
for the metal as a result of the stock market's steep drop on
Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell nearly 39 points in
reaction to rising interest rates in Japan and West Germany and to
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's prediction that the U.S.
economy will grow much more slowly this year than the Bush
administration had predicted.
   In testimony before a House Banking subcommittee, Greenspan also
said inflation was in danger of accelerating.
   In the background are continuing fears of supply disruptions in
South Africa, the world's leading platinum producer, stemming from
the threat of anti-apartheid violence by followers of Nelson
Mandela and the African National Congress.
   Platinum for April delivery has risen more than $20 an ounce
since Mandela's release on Feb. 11.
   ``There are people in the world who, for one reason or another,
fear supply disruptions in the future and keep buying platinum,''
said John Sak, first vice president in charge of precious metals
futures with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Copper futures advanced for the fifth straight session on the
Commodity Exchange amid continuing signs of dwindling supplies.
   The London Metal Exchange on Monday reported a 5,425-ton decline
last week in its warehouse stocks of copper to 88,300 tons.
   On Tuesday, the Commodity Exchange said the level of copper
stocks registered with that exchange fell 609 tons on Friday to
3,020 tons.
   Concerns about tightening supplies have helped boost the price
for March delivery of copper by nearly 13 cents a pound in the past
week.
   Copper futures finished 0.2 cents to 1.7 cents higher with March
at $1.13 a pound.
   Most petroleum futures retreated on the New York Merc, partly in
reaction to analysts' projections for increased crude-oil
production by OPEC in the first half of 1990.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 23 cents
lower with March at $22.19 a barrel; heating oil futures ended .10
cent to .25 cent lower with March at 57.38 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .18 cent lower to .21 cent higher with March at 60.20
cents a gallon.
   Near-month cattle futures fell steeply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in reaction to Friday's monthly USDA cattle-on-feed
report, which showed a larger-than-expected number of cattle being
fed for slaughter in the seven largest cattle-producing states.
   Pork futures rose, with pork bellies up sharply, on news that
the Bush administration had granted most-favored-nation trade
status to Czechoslovakia, which is likely to lead to new Czech
purchases of U.S. pork.
   Live cattle futures settled .98 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with February at 78.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent
to .70 cent lower with March at 81.47 cents a pound; live hogs were
.17 cent to .63 cent higher with February at 49.72 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .60 cent to 1.58 cent higher with February
at 51.30 cents a pound.
   Wheat and soybean futures fell while corn futures rose
fractionally on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely reflecting
weakness in the stock and bond markets.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with March at
$3.82\ a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to } cent higher with
March at $2.41{ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with
March at $1.34} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents to 6 cents lower
with May at $5.78 a bushel.

<HEAD>FBI Looking Into Allegations By Former Sprint Employee</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   US Sprint said Tuesday the FBI is
investigating a former employee's allegations that the
long-distance company obtained confidential information about
competitors when it bid successfully for part of a $25 billion
government contract.
   Sprint officials said the allegations first arose in August
during an exit interview for a Sprint salesman in the Washington
area, whose job was eliminated during a restructuring.
   Spokesman Syd Courson in Kansas City, where Sprint is based,
said the company investigated the allegations and found no evidence
of wrongdoing.
   Courson said the former employee made broad allegations that
Sprint employees had obtained and used other long-distance
companies' confidential information when preparing Sprint's bid for
the FTS 2000 communications contract.
   Sprint, the nation's third-largest supplier of long-distance
service, won 40 percent of the giant contract. Industry leader AT&amp;T
won the majority.
   ``We chalked it up to a disgruntled employee, a former
employee,'' Courson said.
   Sprint's internal investigation was completed in October but
resumed later in the year after allegations, assumed to be by the
same person, that Sprint had tapped into the General Services
Administration computer, Courson said.
   In October, a Sprint employee in the Washington area was
contacted by the FBI, Courson said. Three other employees and an
outside consultant who had worked for Sprint were contacted in late
January about the allegations.
   ``We then contacted the FBI and told them of our findings, and
offered them various documents,'' Courson said. ``We want to
cooperate fully on this and get it behind us. That's essentially
where it stands.''
   Courson said the former employee who made the allegations had
not worked directly on Sprint's bid for the FTS 2000 contract,
described as the biggest non-military award ever handled by the
federal government.

<HEAD>Oil Futures End Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices ended mostly lower in
lackluster trading Tuesday, pressured by supply and demand concerns.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 23 cents
to $22.19 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract, which expired at the
close of trading, lost 42 cents in the previous session.
   The April contract ended 11 cents lower at $22.14 a barrel and
May finished at $21.93, also down 11 cents.
   Analysts said the five-cent spread between the March and April
closing prices did not bode well for future price expectations.
   ``It's not a bullish signal for the spread to be as weak as it
is,'' said Tom Bentz, director of futures trading for United Energy
Inc.
   Bentz said the small difference suggested weakness in demand.
   ``If demand were up March would have been a strong premium over
April,'' he said.
   Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline for March
delivery rose 0.21 cent to 60.20 cents a gallon after losing 0.65
cent in the prior session. All other contracts finished lower.
   No. 2 heating oil for delivery in March slipped 0.10 cent to
57.38 cents a gallon, April declined 0.11 cent to 56.70 cents and
May dropped 0.25 cent to 55.62 cents a gallon.
   Energy analysts said activity in the energy pits was relatively
light with many traders in London for the International Petroleum
Exchange convention.
   Cool weather in the Northeast gave heating oil futures a
psychological boost midway through the session, but buying dried up
amid expectations that demand has weakened while inventories have
climbed.
   Analysts said March gasoline got a lift from a report about an
explosion at an Amoco Oil Co. terminal in Whiting, Ind. A truck
loading liquefied petroleum gas into a storage tank caught fire and
exploded, killing two people and injuring three others, authorities
said.
   The explosion was not expected to disrupt product shipments,
traders said.

<HEAD>Honeywell's 1989 Profit Totals $604 Million, Compared With 1988
Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc., which last year underwent a
restructuring that included cutting jobs and retreating from its
weapons business, on Tuesday reported 1989 earnings of $604
million, compared with a $435 million loss in 1988.
   Fourth-quarter earnings totaled $392 million, or $9.26 a share,
compared with a loss of $483 million, or $11.35 a share, for the
same 1988 period.
   Earnings per share for 1989 were $14.18, compared with a loss of
$10.22 a share in 1988.
   The 1989 figures include an after-tax gain from the sale of
assets _ primarily its sale of Yamatake-Honeywell shares _ of $313
million. Net income excluding asset sales totaled $291 million, the
company said.
   Honeywell previously announced plans to divest its Defense and
Marine Systems business. Income from this discontinued operation
totaled $54 million in 1989, or $1.26 per share, the company said
Tuesday. Income in 1989 from continuing operations totaled $550
million, or $12.92 a share.
   Sales from continuing operations in 1989 were $6.059 billion, up
from $5.857 billion in 1988.
   Fourth-quarter sales from continuing operations were $1.610
billion, compared with $1.587 billion for the same 1988 period.
Excluding sales from units divested in 1988 and 1989, sales grew
nearly 7 percent in the quarter.
   ``In 1989, Honeywell delivered on the commitments we made to our
shareholders,'' James J. Renier, chairman and chief executive
officer, said Tuesday. ``We completed a year of markedly improved
financial results and we took concrete actions to improve
shareholder value. A new level of performance was established from
which we intend to show continued improvement.''
   The company last summer announced a restructuring that included
cutting 4,000 jobs and selling a ``substantial portion'' of its 50
percent stake in Yamatake-Honeywell, a Japanese controls maker.
   Renier said then that Honeywell would focus on its main business
of controls, which range from the familiar round home thermostats
to automation equipment for paper mills and chemical plants.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freeport-McMoran Gold Co., which operates two
gold mining operations in Nevada, has agreed to be bought by
Minorco SA for about $705 million, officials said Tuesday.
   Minorco, a European-based natural resources group with principal
interests in mining and processing metals, will commence a tender
offer of $17 per share for Freeport-McMoran Gold, which is 61
percent owned by Freeport-McMoran, Inc. of New Orleans. The deal
was approved by the Freeport-McMoran Gold board, the companies said.
   Minorco failed last year in a $6.2 billion bid to take over
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC. Gold Fields was later bought by
Hanson PLC in a friendly $5.7 billion deal.
   ``The purchase of Freeport-McMoran Gold is a major step in
Minorco's strategy of becoming an operator rather than a passive
investor,'' said Hank Slack, an executive of Minorco.
   Investors greeted the deal enthusiastically. Freeport-Moran Gold
stock rose $2.62{ to $16.62{ a share on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.
   Freeport-McMoran Inc. said it agreed to tender its 61 percent
interest into the offer or to sell those shares to Minorco
separately if the tender offer is not completed.
   Freeport-McMoran Gold has joint venture interest in two Nevada
gold mining operations. The company owns 70 percent of the Jerritt
Canyon operation and 60 percent of the Big Springs operation, and
operates both mines.
   Attributable gold production at the two sites in 1989 was
244,100 ounces of gold at a cash cost of $207 per ounce.
   For the year ending Dec. 31, 1989, Freeport-McMoran Gold revenue
was $87.9 million and the company had total assets of $179.2
million.
   Freeport-McMoran Inc. said it would use the proceeds of the sale
to help finance development of a sulfur discovery in the Gulf of
Mexico and a copper-gold discovery in Indonesia, said company
spokesman Craig E. Saporito.
   ``We announced our intention of selling some assets and reducing
our debts by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion and using the money to
develop those discoveries. This made sense. It was not part of our
core assets and not part of our long-range plans,'' Saporito said.
   As of Dec. 31, 1989, Freeport-McMoran Gold had proven and
probable reserves of 2.22 million recoverable ounces of gold at its
two mining operations, the majority of it at Jerritt Canyon.

<HEAD>Cellular Telephone Giant Settles Lawsuit Against Radio Paging Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. and
Graphic Scanning Corp. said Tuesday that they had agreed to form a
joint venture to market cellular telephone services in the
Milwaukee area and transfer other cellular properties, ending a
legal dispute.
   Under the agreement, McCaw will manage the Milwaukee joint
venture and own a 92 percent stake in it with Graphic owning 8
percent.
   McCaw also agreed to transfer to Graphic its rights to cellular
telephone interests around Indianapolis, Ind.
   The settlement is subject to federal and state regulatory
approval.
   McCaw, based in Kirkland, Wash., is the nation's largest
cellular telephone company, with customers in 127 markets in 26
states.
   Graphic, based in Englewood, operates one of the country's
largest radio paging businesses, is a major provider of cellular
radio telephone services and serves telecommunications customers in
the United States and the United Kingdom.
   McCaw had sued Graphic claiming the New Jersey company breached
an oral agreement made several years ago in which it pledged to
sell its share of the Milwaukee market for $40 per potential
customer, or about $30 million, far below today's estimated market
value of $175 million.
   Graphic denied agreeing to sell at that price.
   Under a settlement reached last week in U.S. District Court in
Washington state, McCaw and Graphic agreed to create a regional
joint venture by combining Graphic's interest in Milwaukee with
McCaw's cellular interests in Wisconsin and Rockford, Ill. The new
business would have a potential market of more than 1 million
customers.
   ``Graphic took a haircut on the Milwaukee property but they lost
less than they would have if they had gone to court,'' said Sal
Muoio, an analyst with Gabelli &amp; Co., a New York City brokerage
firm that invests in Graphic.
   Late last year, McCaw agreed to buy a controlling interest in
LIN Broadcasting Corp., a New York-based cellular telelphone and
television station operator, for $3.38 billion. The deal is
expected to close in late February.

   Limited Inc. said Tuesday its
fourth-quarter profits increased by 27 percent from the same period
a year ago while earnings for the year rose by 42 percent.
   Fourth-quarter profits totaled $153.1 million, or 85 cents per
share, up from $120.1 million, or 67 cents per share, in the same
period in 1988. The fourth quarter of 1989 was 14 weeks, one week
longer than the same quarter last year.
   Sales were $1.58 billion, a 17 percent increase from $1.35
billion recorded for the year-ago period.
   For all of 1989, earnings totaled $346.9 million, or $1.92 per
share, compared with $245.1 million, or $1.36 a share, in 1988.
   Sales totaled 4.64 billion, a 14 percent increase from $4.07
billion the previous year.
   The company cited no specific reason for the 1989 earnings, but
Chairman Leslie H. Wexner attributed fourth-quarter results in part
to growth among its Express, Victoria's Secret Stores and
Victoria's Secret Catalogue divisions.
   He also cited the restructuring of the Brylane catalog division
into three catalog businesses: Lane Bryant, Roaman's and Lerner.
   He also said the company's contract manufacturer expanded its
operations to meet late-season demands.
   Limited Inc. operates 3,168 specialty apparel stores nationwide
through the Limited, Express, Victoria's Secret, Henri Bendel,
Lerner, Lane Bryant and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. It distributes apparel
nationally through the catalogs.

<HEAD>Maine Government May Pursue Suit Against Georgia-Pacific</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Great Northern Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Maine's attorney general said he was prepared to pursue an
antitrust suit if necessary against Georgia-Pacific Corp., although
Gov. John R. McKernan and some mill workers were more optimistic
about Tuesday's announcement that the company was buying Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp.
   Attorney General James E. Tierney said the state should use the
lawsuit to protect woodcutters and landowners who could be hurt
financially by the $5 billion buyout.
   ``We have wood owners and woodcutters who for years have been
able to sell to two companies and now they only have one,'' said
Tierney, who hoped to negotiate with Georgia-Pacific for assurances.
   Environmentalists also had concerns that the deal would place
more than 2.6 million acres _ about 12 percent of the land in Maine
_ in the hands of a single, out-of-state corporation. Groups such
as the Maine Audubon Society said they wanted to be sure
Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific uses its new holdings for timber
harvesting instead of development.
   Michael Kellett, Northeast regional director of the Wilderness
Society, said the trend toward consolidation stifled diversity and
created ``a more oligopolistic situation.''
   ``But in this case, Great Northern already owned so much that
I'm not sure it's going to make a huge situation,'' Kellett said.
``I do not feel any horrible sense of dread or crisis.''
   Kellett said that in terms of land stewardship, there is no huge
difference among the paper companies.
   Jerry Bley, resource specialist with the Natural Resources
Council of Maine, said it remained to be seen whether
Georgia-Pacific would abide by its assurances that it will maintain
its mill operations use its land for timber operations, rather than
sell parcels to developers to help pay debt incurred in the buyout.
   Great Northern is headquartered in Norwalk, Conn., but is
incorporated in Maine.
   McKernan said he would reserve judgment on pursuing the
antitrust suit. But he was optimistic about Georgia-Pacific's
willingness to continue talks on woodland preservation and job
security for Maine workers.
   ``We have been able to work with Georgia-Pacific, they made it
clear they wanted to be good corporate citizens, they wanted to
have the company flourish here in Maine,'' he said.
   Georgia-Pacific operates three mills in Woodland in eastern
Maine and owns about 470,000 acres of forest land, according to the
attorney general's office. Great Northern owns 2.1 million acres
and three mills.
   Great Northern mill workers said they were relieved but
apprehensive about Tuesday's announcement, which followed a bitter,
four-month takeover battle.
   ``I'm kind of relieved to get it over with,'' said Fredericka
Boynton, whose family has worked in the Millinocket mill for
generations. ``I think it's going to be all right. You make the
best of it.''
   ``There's probably going to be a mixture of relief and
apprehension,'' said Town Manager William Ayoob, ``relief that the
corporate war is over, but apprehension that a new company is
taking over.''

<HEAD>Zenith in Dispute Over Computer Unit's Price; Earnings From TVs
Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. on Tuesday revealed a
disagreement with Groupe Bull over the final sale price of Zenith's
computer business to the French concern.
   Both parties agreed the issue does not threaten to derail Bull's
acquisition of Zenith Data Systems, which was effectively completed
in December.
   But because the eventual outcome will affect Zenith's financial
condition, the company reported fourth-quarter and annual results
only for its consumer electronics business, which consists mainly
of televisions and TV components.
   The results included a 47 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit
and a $17 million loss for all of 1989, which the company said
reflected higher material and labor costs despite higher sales
volume and efficiency improvements.
   Zenith is disputing Bull's request for a $49 million refund on
its Dec. 28 payment of $496.4 million for Zenith Data Systems, said
Zenith spokesman John I. Taylor.
   Zenith had previously indicated that it expected a further
payment, not a refund request, from Bull as the final adjustment to
the purchase price
   ``Clearly, we have a difference of opinion of significant
magnitude,'' Zenith Chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said in a statement.
   Zenith characterized the disagreement as a major dispute and
said Bull may have violated the terms of their contract.
   A Bull spokesman denied the charge and downplayed the issue,
pointing out that Zenith has 30 days to review the request and
another 30 days in which to negotiate a resolution before an
arbitrator steps in.
   ``We don't see it as major dispute at all,'' said spokesman
Patrick Marx in a telephone interview from Bull's Paris
headquarters.
   Zenith announced Oct. 2 an agreement to sell the computer unit
to Bull for $91.9 million plus the adjusted net book value of the
assets sold, for a total that Zenith initially estimated at $635
million and later lowered to an estimated $610 million.
   On Dec. 28, Bull paid Zenith $496.4 million in cash, an
agreed-upon amount that Taylor said reflected 90 percent of the sum
of the $91.9 million premium and the adjusted net book value of the
computer unit's assets through Nov. 30.
   The payment effectively closed the sale of Zenith Data Systems,
leaving only a final adjustment that would include the unit's asset
value at the end of December.
   The sale agreement provided for Bull to submit the final
adjustment, based on an audit of Zenith Data Systems commissioned
by Bull.
   Electronics analysts said the dispute was a surprise and that a
$49 million refund would hurt Zenith.
   ``If it works against them, it will affect their ability to
bring down debt levels,'' said Laura Lederman, an analyst with Duff
&amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   Zenith had previously estimated a $22 million fourth-quarter
operating profit from the computer unit but said Tuesday that
because of substantial deterioration in the business during
December, it expects the division to report a net loss.
   For its consumer electronics business, Zenith reported net
income of $4 million, or 15 cents per common share, for the three
months ending Dec. 31 compared with $7.5 million, or 29 cents per
share, for the same period a year ago.
   Fourth-quarter revenue from consumer electronics rose slightly,
to $443 million from $440 million in 1988.
   For the full year, Zenith reported a net loss from consumer
electronics of of $17 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a
net loss of $11 million, or 42 cents a share, in 1988.
   Annual revenue from consumer electronics rose 11 percent to $1.5
billion from $1.4 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Disney Chief: CBS Merger Rumors `Ridiculous'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner
on Tuesday labeled reports of a possible merger with broadcasting
giant CBS Inc. as rumors.
   But asked about the possibility of a merger by one of 9,000
Disney shareholders at Disney's annual meeting, Eisner added:
``That is not to say we wouldn't talk to them, haven't talked to
them.''
   The shareholder cited repeated reports in business and
entertainment trade publications of a possible takeover of CBS by
cash-rich Disney, which is rapidly expanding its entertainment,
theme parks resorts and consumer products businesses.
   Disney earned $703 million in fiscal 1989, 35 percent more than
in 1988.
   ``We don't comment on any rumors,'' Eisner said at the meeting,
held at a convention center near Disneyland. Acknowledging the
persistence of the reports, he added: ``If we did comment, we would
have to comment every day on ridiculous rumors.''
   Eisner and Disney President Frank Wells were brought in to run
Disney at the end of 1984, and since then the company has boomed,
with sharply higher revenues, expansions of moviemaking and theme
parks and the decision last year to start a record label.
   The executives reviewed Disney's overlapping plans to exploit
its trademark characters in theme parks, resorts, television,
movies, recordings and magazines.
   They showed off Italian-language Disney comics and planned
software to allow computer users to create their own Disney
animation; displayed a prototype of a planned Mickey Mouse magazine
in Russian and said Polish and Hungarian versions were being
developed; and described the promotional blitz of products that
will accompany Disney's ``Dick Tracy'' movie this summer.
   They also said Disney hopes to expand its stores from 41 now to
perhaps 200, with outlets in Tokyo and Paris; reviewed previously
announced plans to add new attractions to its theme parks and open
all-new parks in California, Japan and Florida; and said they would
court convention business with new hotels to help during slow
periods.
   Epitomizing how Disney is expanding and blending its franchises
was a tape of Miss Piggy _ Disney acquired rights to the Muppets
last year _ singing ``Some Day My Prince Will Come'' from
``Cinderella'' in French for a Christmas special on European
television.
   ``A great percentage of our growth potential lies outside our
borders,'' Wells said.
   The wholesome image nurtured by founder Walt Disney was foremost
in the minds of many shareholders, who peppered Eisner with
questions about concerns over movies for mature audiences put out
by Disney's Touchstone studio, soon to be joined by Hollywood
Pictures, a third Disney studio.
   Asked about the use of four-letter words in those pictures,
Eisner said, ``I'm no more pleased to see Bette Midler use an
expletive than to see my 16-year-old use an expletive.''
   But he said, ``Our movies tend to reflect society,'' adding that
Disney can never hope to attract top filmmakers if ``we become
censors.''
   Another shareholder asked whether Disney was worried about
losing the public's confidence by releasing ``crime terror and
violence such as `Dick Tracy' and `Cocktail,''' which starred Tom
Cruise.
   ``I believe there is a place for all kinds of movies if they are
correctly labeled,'' Eisner said. He said he thought viewers would
find ``Dick Tracy'' to be ``clearly a Disney film'' and less
violent than it appeared in the trailer.
   Separately, Disney said Tuesday it was increasing the company's
quarterly cash dividend from 12 cents per share to 14{ cents per
share. The dividend is payable May 15 to shareholders of record on
April 13.

<HEAD>Guinness Case Link with Boesky, Witness claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guinness PLC invested $100 million in convicted
arbitrager Ivan Boesky's investment fund one month after he
supported the brewing company's shares during its bid to take over
a distillery, a witness said.
   Olivier Roux, Guinness' former finance director, testified
Tuesday at the trial of former Guinness chairman Ernest Saunders
and three other men accused of conspiring to boost the price of
Guinness' stock to make its offer for Distillers Co. more
attractive.
   The four face a total of 35 charges involving theft, false
accounting and conspiracy in the course of Guinness' $4.3 billion
acquisition of Distillers, a Scottish whisky and gin manufacturer.
   U.S. attorney Thomas Ward, a Guinness director, enlisted Boesky
and millionaire investor Meshulam Riklis, husband of actress Pia
Zadora, to support the bid in 1986, Roux said at Southwark Crown
Court in London.
   Roux is a key witness who has been granted immunity in return
for his testimony.
   He was asked by prosecutor John Chadwick: ``Were you aware
Guinness made an investment of $100 million in the Boesky
partnership?''
   ``Yes,'' Roux replied. ``I was aware of the concept which came
from Mr. Ward. I think he raised that at a meeting we had with Mr.
Saunders in New York in mid-May 1986.''
   Roux said the investment was approved by a Guinness board
committee and later the whole board was told of the deal.
   Boesky was sentenced in December 1987 to three years in prison
for filing false information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the proposed acquisition of Fischbach
Corp. Boesky, who was released to a halfway house last November to
finish his term, earlier paid a civil penalty of $100 million to
the SEC for trading on inside information.
   Ward, who has denied any wrongdoing and is fighting extradition
proceedings in the United States, is named in two of the charges
facing Saunders, 54; Heron Group chairman Gerald Ronson, 50;
stockbroker Anthony Parnes, 44, and millionaire financier Sir Jack
Lyons, 74. They have pleaded innocent.
   The prosecution alleges an illegal operation to spend the
equivalent of $42.5 million boosting the price of Guinness stock to
make its cash and share bid for Distilers more attractive in the
face of a rival bid from supermarket operator Argyll Group PLC.
   The prosecution alleges Ward illegally received the equivalent
of $8.8 million following the takeover and authorized an illicit
payment of the equivalent of $510,000 to Lyons.
   Roux, the first witness at the trial, said Ward was ``intimately
involved'' in the takeover battle against Argyll and kept the
campaign going. He said Ward claimed the $8.8 million payment was
to pay bills incurred in the United States, but he gave ``only
vague'' descriptions of the work done, Roux said.
   Roux said Ward wanted the money put into an offshore bank
account of a company named Marketing and Acquisitions Consultants
to ``maintain confidentiality.''
   The prosecution alleged Ward used the account to receive
personal payments.
   Roux said he was concerned because all payments to directors had
to be disclosed to the full board. But Saunders confirmed the
payment and reassured him the money was not going to Ward
personally.
   When the prosecutor concluded his opening statement on Monday,
he claimed that Saunders received $5.1 million from the payment
made to Ward and kept it in a secret Swiss bank account.

<HEAD>Chevron Revamps Its U.S. Exploration and Production Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. said Tuesday it was cutting
its U.S. oil exploration and production business because of
diminishing oil reserves in the continental United States and
public opposition to offshore drilling.
   Chevron U.S.A., the domestic oil and gas subsidiary of the
nation's third-largest oil company, said it expects to eliminate
800 to 1,000 positions, or 10 to 12 percent of the organization,
including middle and senior managers.
   Chevron, which will expand its international exploration and
production, plans to accelerate sales of U.S. assets by unloading
about 1,000 of its 1,700 domestic oil fields for some $700 million
over the next two years.
   The company said it will sell the fields, which account for only
11 percent of current production, to small or regional operators
for whom the fields might make a better fit, or negotiate trades
with large companies.
   The changes are expected to result in a charge against 1990
first-quarter earnings of between $25 million and $30 million, the
company said.
   Chevron, with $34.5 billion in assets, took a $1.2 billion
charge against fourth-quarter 1989 earnings primarily because of an
inactive oil field and environmental cleanup costs. The charge led
to an $883 million loss for the quarter and depressed 1989 profits
to $251 million from $1.77 billion in 1988.
   Chevron's problems left its stock undervalued, according to
analysts, and vulnerable to a takeover or restructuring.
   That in turn spurred heavy trading in recent months while
Chevron engaged in a legal battle to force Pennzoil Co. to sell its
8.8 percent share of Chevron stock. Chevron said it is worried that
Pennzoil would try to use its position to force a restructuring
detrimental to Chevron stockholders.
   Wall Street reacted with mild enthusiasm to Tuesday's
announcement as Chevron's stock, down $1.12{ before the release hit
the wire late in the trading day, rebounded slightly to close down
67{ cents at $69.25.
   ``I'm very encouraged,'' said Frederick Leuffer, an analyst with
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. in New York. ``I think it
represents a turn for the company. All the details are not out.
This is only a relatively modest step in the right direction. We
should find out more tomorrow.''
   Chevron executives scheduled a meeting with analysts Wednesday
in New York.
   The company said its restructuring is aimed mostly at cutting
layers of management and lowering operating costs to make it more
competitive and enhance profitability and shareholders' investments.
   Leuffer said Chevron, the nation's third largest oil company
after Exxon Corp. and Mobil Oil Corp., is vastly undervalued. He
placed its value at ``at least $116 a share,'' and said the stock
could reach $90 a share.
   In 1988 and 1989, Chevron sold about $210 million worth of
domestic assets.
   The company said it hoped that many staff cuts could be achieved
voluntarily.
   The organizational changes include:
   _ Chevron U.S.A.'s three current exploration, land and
production regions, based in San Ramon, Calif., Houston, and New
Orleans, will be eliminated, including their management
organization structure and positions.
   _ In place of the regional organization, the exploration and
production functions will be divided into seven distinct business
units, each directly responsible for its own financial performance,
plus a centralized land department. All will report to a Chevron
U.S.A. senior vice president in San Francisco.
   In production, five business units will be set up, headquartered
in Bakersfield, Calif., Denver, Midland and Houston, Texas, and New
Orleans. Current production activities now managed from Ventura,
Calif., will be consolidated and report to the Bakersfield office.

   Officials of Eastern Airlines met Tuesday with
major creditors in an effort to reach agreement on a new plan for
its bankruptcy reorganization.
   Eastern's exclusive right to file such a plan was due to expire
at midnight unless the federal bankruptcy court granted the airline
another extension.
   Representatives of the airline and its creditors continued to
meet late Tuesday and planned to extend the discussions into
Wednesday, said Karen Ceremsak, a spokeswoman for Eastern at its
headquarters in Miami. She declined to provide further details.
   Ms. Ceremsak said it appeared unlikely that Eastern would
request an extension of Tuesday's end to its exclusive period,
because creditors were negotiating with Eastern and unlikely to
file their own reorganization plan.
   Creditors' attorneys and other representatives couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Last Monday U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland granted
Eastern's request for an eight-day extension, to Tuesday, of the
deadline for filing its reorganization plan on an exclusive basis.
During that time, other parties such as creditors cannot submit
competing proposals.
   Lifland extended the deadline after several parties in the
proceeding said progress had been made toward agreement on a plan.
   Eastern has been restructuring under bankruptcy court
supervision since a bitter strike began last March 4.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 proceeding, supported Eastern's request last
week for an extension and told Lifland that ``substantial
progress'' is being made in negotiations between the airline and
its creditors.
   The committee representing unsecured creditors also supported
Eastern's petition.
   Even representatives of preferred shareholders, who recently
advocated liquidation or outright sale of Eastern, supported the
airline's request for more time.
   The preferred shareholders had criticized Eastern's latest
reorganization proposal, which proposes to pay them no more than 10
cents on the dollar in the form of new stock.
   Eastern's latest plan also calls for paying unsecured creditors
only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges
from bankruptcy protection, and 70 percent more over the following
10 years, without interest.
   In return for accepting partial repayment, Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp. would give the unsecured creditors 40 percent of
Eastern's equity.
   Lawyers representing the Air Line Pilots Association and the
Machinists union have opposed Eastern's requests for extensions of
the deadline.
   Last week's extension was the fourth granted by Lifland since
the bankruptcy proceeding began last March 9.
   The Eastern pilots and flight attendants abandoned their
sympathy strikes just before Thanksgiving, but Eastern had rebuilt
as a smaller carrier and hired mostly non-union workers to replace
the strikers. The Machinists union remains on strike against the
carrier.

   A man who was accused of embezzling more than
$200,000 from house accounts at Prudential-Bache Securities has
been sentenced to 24 months probation.
   Richard Kofler, who pleaded guilty June 29 to one count of
felony mail fraud, also was ordered by U.S. District Judge John
Keenan in Manhattan to pay $68,401.60 in restitution.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kerry Lawrence said that in addition to
the restitution, Kofler had agreed with Prudential-Bache to pay
back an additional amount to the firm.
   Kofler, 38, of Staten Island, admitted during his plea that he
used his position as an operations manager to transfer shares from
a Prudential-Bache mutual fund account to a fictitious account.
   Kofler said he wrote letters in the name of the fictitious
account holder asking that the shares be redeemed and sent to one
or more private post office boxes.
   Keenan told Kofler he was imposing the lenient sentence
primarily at the request of the U.S. attorney's office, but he
warned Kofler that any similar future conduct would result in a
jail term.
   Lawrence said he did not know if Kofler still works in the
securities industry, and declined to comment on why his office
sought leniency.

Commercial Airplane Group confirmed.
   The order brings to 14 the number of long-range 747-400s the
Hong Kong-based carrier has committed to buy. The airline also has
ordered 15 other 747s of other series _ six 747-300s, eight 747-200
passenger jets and one -200 freighter.
   Cathay has taken delivery of three 747-400s from Boeing. It uses
them to fly passengers nonstop between Hong Kong and European
destinations.
   Turned-up wingtips, a 12-foot longer wingspan and the use of
advanced composite materials help make Boeing's new 747-400
jetliner the longest-range passenger jet in the world. It can fly
8,400 statute miles nonstop fully loaded.
   Tuesday's order brings total Boeing 747-400 orders to 259.
   So far this year, Boeing has announced orders for 88 aircraft
valued at about $7.28 billion.
