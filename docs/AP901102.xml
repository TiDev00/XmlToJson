<HEAD>Candidate Acknowledged Occasional Marijuana Use: Post</HEAD>

   The Republican nominee for Congress from the
nation's capital acknowledged in 1984 that he had occasionally
smoked marijuana while in the Reagan administration, The Washington
Post reported in Saturday editions.
   Harry M. Singleton made the admission in a divorce proceeding,
saying six years ago that he had used marijuana ``probably five''
times in the preceeding three years.
   During that time, he rose from chief minority counsel of the
House District Committee to deputy assistant secretary of commerce
and then to assistant secretary of education.
   ``I was experimenting when I was deputy assistant secretary,''
Singleton said in an interview with The Post. ``I was not what you
would call a user . . . . You're at a party and somebody's passing
something around and you take a hit.''
   Singleton, 41, said he would not characterize his use as right
or wrong, but rather ``certainly something a lot of people in my
generation did.''
   In a deposition in the divorce proceeding, Singleton said that
while an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University, ``I
grew marijuana I think once or twice as an experiment in my dorm
room.''
   He told the Post on Friday he didn't recall ever growing
marijuana. As for smoking it, Singleton said, ``The point is, I do
not do that now and have not for years. That was probably the last
time I did anything like that.''
   Possession of marijuana in the District of Columbia is a
misdemeanor.
   Singleton is running against Democrat Eleanor Holmes Norton to
be D.C. delegate to Congress.
   The Post said it discovered the deposition while reviewing
Singleton's divorce case, after a former Singleton associate and an
aide to Norton suggested that the paper look more closely at his
personal life.
   The deposition came during a bitter divorce case that ended with
Singleton's being awarded custody of the couple's two children.
   In her own deposition, Margot Singleton, then an employee of the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleged that she and
Singleton had used cocaine.
   Both in the deposition and in an interview, Singleton
emphatically denied the allegations of cocaine use.
   Margot Singleton also alleged he had beaten her on several
occasions.
   In the deposition, he said ``there was no violence with the
exception of one occasion when we had a knock down drag out fight.
That was the only time that we had ever come to blows.''

   Alan Cranston, one of five U.S. senators with
ties to financier Charles Keating Jr., declined an invitation to
testify before a grand jury probing junk bond sales at a Keating
thrift, transcripts unsealed Friday show.
   Cranston is one of the ``Keating Five,'' senators who accepted
$1.3 million in political contributions from the Arizona developer.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating whether they
improperly intervened with regulators on Keating's behalf to keep
open his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association long after it should
have been seized.
   Larry Mason, special counsel to the grand jury, said in the
transcripts that an invitation to testify was sent to Cranston. The
Democratic senator's attorney replied with a letter saying Cranston
would be unable to testify.
   ``The letter indicated that he requested the grand jury to
withdraw their invitation to testify, basically because of a busy
schedule. And he didn't feel he had anything too material to say,''
said Lynn Miller, a Keating prosecutor.
   Cranston said he was unaware of the severity of Lincoln's
problems at the time he spoke to thrift regulators. He said he
talked to the regulators merely to try to cut red tape on behalf of
Keating, a substantial California employer.
   The 4,600-page, 45-volume transcript unsealed at the request of
media organizations in Keating's criminal fraud case was filled
with other allegations as well.
   An 83-year-old widow told the grand jury she was lured into
plunging her savings into risky bonds sold at Lincoln Savings by an
investment counselor who assured her they were safe.
   Adelaida Whinfield said she lost $50,000 on bonds purchased at a
Lincoln Savings branch in Hemet, a desert community 100 miles east
of Los Angeles. Mrs. Whinfield said an investment counselor told
her the bonds ``were as safe as the United States of America.''
   Keating and three former top officers of his companies are
charged with misleading investors about the safety of risky junk
bonds sold at branches of Lincoln Savings, which later failed. The
bonds were issued by the now-defunct parent of Lincoln, American
Continental Corp., which Keating headed.
   Keating and the others are charged with ordering employees to
steer Lincoln depositors away from insured certificates of deposit
and into the bonds.
   Many other buyers were elderly and lost their life savings. All
told, 17,458 investors lost more than $250 million, prosecutors
said. The indictment listed only 20 victims who lost $1.1 million.
Prosecutors said they wanted a clear, concise case to present to
the jury.
   Grand jurors heard from many investors who said they had been
deceived about the bonds' safety. The transcript was unsealed by
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito at the request of news
organizations.
   Rose Brine, 63, a housewife from suburban Lakewood, said a
teller instructed her to talk to a bond salesman when she came in
to renew her certificate of deposit, which carried a low interest
rate.
   Mrs. Brine said she was told the bonds carried higher rates, as
high as 9 percent, but was never told they were uninsured. She said
she first invested $10,000, then put in another $50,000, her life
savings.
   ``That was it, the whole thing,'' Mrs. Brine said.
   Meanwhile, the Resolution Trust Corp. announced Friday it is
putting up for sale 18 failed savings institutions, including
Lincoln Savings, which is considered to be the costliest collapsed
thrift ever.
   The failure of Lincoln could cost taxpayers an estimated $2
billion.

   A national Ku Klux Klan leader said Friday
that Democratic Senate candidate Harvey Gantt was ``another crooked
black politician'' whose victory over Jesse Helms would help boost
the group's membership.
   Imperial Wizard J.W. Farrands told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview that Gantt should be elected ``so they can see
what a black politician can do.''
   Farrands, who heads the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the
Ku Klux Klan, one of numerous klan groups, was asked to explain his
group's announcement of its ``endorsement'' of Gantt's candidacy.
   ``If they elect him, they'll find out we've got another crooked
black politician,'' Farrands said. ``He'll tax everybody equally as
long as they're workng people and give all their money to the poor
and downtrodden.
   ``God help the state of North Carolina,'' he said. ``That's what
they need.''
   Gantt did not return numerous telephone calls the AP made Friday
to his Charlotte campaign office. Campaign officials would not
comment on Farrands' statements. The election is Tuesday.
   Helms, the incumbent conservative Republican, was en route to a
rally late Friday and could not immediately be reached for comment.
   Gantt, who was the first black mayor of Charlotte, has accused
Helms of trying to make race an issue in the campaign through
television advertisements that discuss hiring quotas for
minorities.
   Helms has defended the spots as raising legitimate issues about
hiring quotas and Gantt's background.
   A Charlotte Observer-WSCC-TV poll broadcast Friday said Gantt
led Helms by 6 percentage points. Of 703 likely voters surveyed, 47
percent said they favored Gantt, while 41 percent supported Helms.
Twelve percent were undecided.
   The margin of error was 3.7 percent.
   Farrands' comments came three days after a state leader of his
Klan group released a letter announcing its ``endorsement'' of
Gantt.
   ``We envision him as being the catalyst to a powerful resurgence
of our hooded order in the Tarheel State,'' Robert Bost, the
group's Grand Dragon in North Carolina wrote in a letter sent to
several news organizations. ``May he fulfill that (role)
admirably.''
   When Gantt heard about the letter earlier this week, he declined
to directly address the so-called ``endorsement.''
   ``I heard rumors to that effect,'' Gantt told reporters at the
time. ``I don't really think I have a comment. There have been some
tricks in this campaign and this may be one of them.''
   Earlier Friday, Gantt vowed to stay on the ``high road'' in the
campaign's final days.
   ``I've tried to be consistent and stay on that high road all the
way through,'' Gantt said. ``We're going to try to prove once and
for all that you can win in North Carolina running against Jesse
Helms running a clean, positive, issue-oriented campaign.''
   He said that relaxed U.S.-Soviet relations offered an
opportunity to cut the federal deficit and called for a ``lean and
mean and technologically superior'' defense posture.
   He also said the federal government should be an ``aggressive
partner'' in education, protecting the environment and encouraging
a national energy policy, he added. Money also needs to be spent to
improve health care, address the crime and drug problems and reduce
poverty, he said.
   The woman who beat Gantt in the Charlotte's 1987 mayoral race,
Sue Myrick, campaigned for Helms and said Gantt wanted to increase
social welfare programs.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court upheld a ruling
Friday that the Los Angeles County supervisors discriminated
against Hispanics when they redrew district lines.
   The court ordered an election in a new district with a Hispanic
majority.
   By a 2-1 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approved a
plan by U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, who had found intentional
manipulation of election boundaries by supervisors in 1981 to
dilute the voting strength of Hispanics.
   The court rejected the county's argument that no new lines
should be drawn until after the 1990 census.
   The county's population of 8.7 million is about 35 percent
Hispanic. No Hispanic has been elected to the five-member Board of
Supervisors in its 115-year history.
   The court said Kenyon should schedule an election as soon as
possible in the new district to succeed retiring Supervisor Pete
Schabarum.
   Because of the time needed for computer preparation, the primary
election is likely to occur in February or March, said Ramona
Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union
of Southern California, which represented Hispanic plaintiffs in
the case.
   ``It's a complete victory,'' she said. ``We've maintained all
along that the county Board of Supervisors discriminated against
Hispanics. Only white males have been elected to that governing
body since its inception. This is a great day for minorities and
women. It means the government belongs to all of us.''

   Leftist guerrillas killed 10 people, including
an official of President Alberto Fujimori's Change 90 movement, in
a wave of attacks around the country, police said Friday.
   Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, led by a woman, Thursday night
gunned down Change 90 organizer Hector Montero and his maid in the
southern Andean city of Ayacucho, police said.
   Montero's wife, 2-year-old son and a guest were seriously
wounded in the attack, police said.
   The rebels also killed a policeman and five other people,
including a student beheaded in Ayacucho, police said. The city is
a departmental capital 230 miles southeast of Lima.
   Police said those killings were apparently in response to a
government decree Oct. 24 that lifted the state of emergency in
Ayacucho. The city was first declared an emergency zone in 1983.
   In Lima, four leftist rebels shot to death the manager of a shoe
factory in the residential area of Brena on Friday, police said.
   In an earlier attack, guerrillas Thursday killed a school
principal in the central Andean village of Quilcas, about 120 miles
east of Lima, police said.
   Police also said they found the body of a man in an agrarian
cooperative on the outskirts of Lima. He had been tortured and
shot, they said.
   Political violence has claimed more than 20,000 lives in the
decade since the Shining Path started its war of insurgency.

<HEAD>Smith Students End Week of Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week of round-the-clock sit-ins at
Smith College ended Friday when administrators and students
tentatively agreed to set up a center for minority and foreign
students.
   Up to 60 students had camped out in the halls of Smith's main
administration building since Oct. 26 to demand creation of a
multicultural center. Numerous marches were held at the private
women's college during the week.
   Thursday night, the leaders tentatively accepted the
administration's offer to temporarily base the center at Hampshire
House, a center for commuter students. The rest of the students
tentatively approved the offer Friday and called off the protest.
   Under the agreement, leaders of the campus' various cultural
groups will form a task force to work with administrators to find a
permanent home for the center.
   The agreement was not to be formalized until Monday, when
administrators said they would know if the Hampshire House would be
available. Officials were to spend the weekend searching for a new
home for the commuter center.
   About 17 percent of Smith's 2,600 students are non-white.
   ``Most of us are just so happy it's over because we're so
tired,'' said Vivian Chiang, leader of the Asian Students
Association. The group was one of seven involved in the protest.
   ``We're thrilled that we've reached an agreement,'' said school
spokeswoman Debra Bradley. ``It has been an exhausting process.''

   Scientists have, for the first time,
genetically engineered the parts of plant cells where
photosynthesis occurs.
   Rutgers University researchers said they have introduced
genetically altered material into the chloroplasts of a tobacco
plant, whose seeds produced plants that carried the same traits.
   Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, the tiny structures in
plant cells that contain chlorophyll. Photosynthesis is the
fundamental process by which plants make food and capture the sun's
energy.
   ``We now have this tool to genetically improve photosynthesis,
to make it more efficient,'' said Pal Maliga, the director of
Rutgers' research team.
   Improved photosynthesis could eventually make for bigger and
sturdier plants that could more efficiently produce food in a
shorter amount of time, Maliga said.
   Scientists in other parts of the country hailed the Rutgers
finding as a breakthrough.
   ``It certainly is a first in higher plants,'' said Milton
Zaitlin, the director of the biotechnology program at Cornell
University in Ithaca, N.Y.
   ``It's a major breakthrough,'' said Richard Hallick, a
biochemist at the University of Arizona. ``It's something that has
been sought for at least a decade.''
   The results of the experiment were reported Thursday in The
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific
journal.
   Photosynthesis is fundamental to all plant and animal life
because it provides the carbohydrates to power their metabolic
processes.
   In photosynthesis, green plants use sunlight to make
carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in the presence of
chlorophyll.
   All fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas - originally
captured their energy from the sun through photosynthesis.
   One of the first commercial spinoffs could be to engineer plants
resistant to herbicides, said Randall Hauptmann, director of the
Plant and Molecular Biology Center at Northern Illinois University
in DeKalb.
   Many herbicides work through the photosynthetic process to kill
weeds. Farmers could apply herbicide to kill weeds while not
hurting the resistant crops, he said.
   In the long term, scientists could use the findings to explore
ways of developing plants resistant to drought or low temperatures,
Maliga said.
   ``We want crop plants to perform to serve human needs, which
wasn't the object of evolution,'' Maliga said.
   Three compartments in plant cells contain genes - the nucleus,
chloroplasts and mitochondria.
   Scientists have introduced altered genes into the nucleus, and
most biotechnological innovation to date comes from this method of
transformation.
   Researchers have also introduced genetically altered material
into the chloroplasts of algae, but never before into the
chloroplasts of higher plants or into mitochondria.
   Maliga and two other scientists - Zora Svab and Peter
Hajdukiewitz - worked on the two-year project under a grant from
the New Jersey Science Initiative.
   The team coated microscopic tungsten particles with an altered
chloroplast gene from a tobacco plant. Using a ``particle
bombardment process,'' the team used a special gun to spray the
cells with the tiny pellets.
   The scientists then used the cells to raise plants that were
genetically stable. The new plants produced seeds that contained
the altered genes.
   ``We can do it on a regular basis, but it is inefficient,''
Maliga said. ``We want to make ita tool available to all plant
scientists.''
   Tobacco was used because tobacco is one of the few plants whose
cell culture is well-known, Maliga said.
   Rutgers university has filed a patent on the process, Maliga
said.

   The Museum of Modern Art will receive the
multimillion-dollar collection of art assembled by William Paley,
the late founder of CBS Inc.
   The gift includes 84 paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings,
including Pablo Picasso's 1906 masterpiece ``Boy Leading a Horse''
and other works by Picasso, Renoir, Gauguin and Degas.
   ``At a time when donations of great works of art to museums have
been declining because of tax changes and soaring values, this
magnificent donation of masterpieces sets an extraordinary example
of generosity and spirit,'' said Richard E. Oldenburg, director of
the museum.
   Oldenburg called the collection ``one of the most significant
ever presented to this institution.''
   Paley, who died Oct. 26 at age 89, was appointed a trustee of
the museum in 1937 and served as board president from 1968 to 1972
and chairman from 1972 to 1985.
   Over the years he had given the museum many works by Picasso and
others.
   In his will, Paley left the bulk of his large art collection to
the William S. Paley Foundation, which he set up in 1936. The
museum and the foundation have just completed an agreement for the
transfer of the collection to the museum.

<TEXT>
   COLOGNE, Germany - Thousands of Vietnamese in former East
Germany who lost their jobs or were victims of racial attacks will
be airlifted back to their homeland, the head of a relief
organization says.
   Vietnamese in Magdeburg have been targets of attacks by radical
right-wing ``skinheads,'' Rupert Neudeck, chairman of the Cap
Anamur Committee, said Thursday.
   The Soviet airline Aeroflot has agreed to begin flying
Vietnamese out of former East Germany, said Neudeck, whose group is
made up of German doctors involved in relief work.
   Companies in eastern Germany have promised to pay $2,000 per
traveler for the return trips, Neudeck said, adding that about
1,200 Vietnamese would be returned home each week.
   East Germany had about 85,000 foreign workers from nations
including Angola, Mozambique and Vietnam, but many have lost their
jobs as the country scrapped communism and merged with West Germany
this year.

<HEAD>Cost-Price Squeeze Hitting Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's latest monthly
indicators of prices paid and received by farmers shows a classic
pattern of cost-price squeeze.
   In July, the index of prices farmers receive for what they
producrs had the same buying power they had in 1910-14.
   For example, the average price of corn in October was reported
at $2.15 per bushel, only 38 percent of the theoretical price of
full parity - $5.67 per bushel.
   Overall, the report showed commodity prices averaged 52 percent
of parity in October, the lowest reading since April 1988 and one
of the lowest since the early years of the Great Depression in the
1930s.
   Although some USDA records are contradictory, the all-time low
mark in the parity ratio was around 49 percent in June 1932. It
hovered near that five years ago at 50 percent for several months.
   Many economists, including some in USDA itself, say the old
parity concept is outmoded and doesn't reflect today's agricultural
finance sector, including efficiencies of production and net
income.
   Its defenders say parity still is important in showing a
relationship between prices and costs, trends and changes from one
year to another.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. rice stockpile will remain tight in
the 1990-91 marketing year, despite loss of the Iraqi market,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Rice output in 1990 is expected to fall short of use for the
fifth straight year, the department's Economic Research Service
said.
   But rice imports, mostly from Thailand, probably will keep
reserve inventories from falling by the end of the marketing year
next Aug. 1, the report said.
   Rice imports in calendar 1989 totaled about 2.7 million
hundredweight, with nearly 2.4 million coming from Thailand.
   Total U.S. rice production this year is forecast at 158.1
million hundredweight, up 2.3 percent from 1989. Exports are
projected to fall 3.6 percent to 74 million hundredweight.
   Analysts attributed the export decline to reduced world trade
and the United Nations general embargo against Iraq.
   Exporters are searching for new markets to replace the
``substantial loss'' of the Iraqi market, the report said. Eastern
Europe, Africa and Latin America were said to be areas where U.S.
rice exports are likely to increase.
   The U.S. rice carryover next Aug. 1 is projected at 26.3 million
hundredweight, unchanged from this year.

   Two more elderly people have died of
St. Louis encephalitis, bringing the death toll in an outbreak of
the mosquito-borne illness to five, a state official said Thursday.
   An 89-year-old woman in Lee County died Thursday and a
78-year-old man in Sarasota died Wednesday, said David Adams, a
spokesman for the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services.
   The department would not release the names of victims.
   The man's illness had been confirmed before his death, Adams
said. The woman had tested positive but died of the disease before
a second confirmation test could be done, Adams said.
   Of the three earlier cases, a 58-year-old woman in Brevard
County, a 69-year-old man in Orange County and an 80-year-old man
in St. Lucie, two had been confirmed cases before death, Adams
said.
   A death in Martin County has also been linked to St. Louis
encephalitis but tests have not yet shown whether the flu-like
illness, which can progress to a fatalbrain-inflammation, was the
actual cause of death.
   Three more cases of St. Louis encephalitis were reported,
bringing Florida's total since mid-August to 79.
   Eight people died during the last Florida outbreak of the
disease in 1977. The state usually has one to three cases of the
illness each year.
   Since the virus for St. Louis encephalitis is carried by a
mosquito species that bites during dusk, health officials recommend
people stay inside for an hour before sunset to two or three hours
afterward.
   If people must go outside, they should wear long pants and
sleeves and use insect repellant.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $60,000 to Woman for Gulf Power Plane Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury awarded $60,000 to a woman for
mental distress and other damages from a plane crash that destroyed
her apartment and killed a utility executive.
   Gulf Power Co. Senior Vice President Jacob Horton of Pensacola
and the plane's two pilots died in the April 10, 1989, crash.
   No one on the ground was killed when the plane crashed into a
Pensacola apartment complex. Maria Hughes, who filed the lawsuit,
briefly was trapped in the rubble of her apartment but her only
physical injury was a cut on one hand.
   She said in the lawsuit she has had nightmares and has been
depressed and suicidal because of the traumatic experience.
   ``I'm very irritable,'' she told the jury. After a long pause
and some prompting from her lawyer, she added: ``I can't get along
with anybody. I'm depressed all the time.''
   The suit originally was filed against Southern Company Services
of Birmhingham, Ala., which owned the twin-engine airplane, and
Horton's estate. The estate was dropped from the case.
   Gulf, headquartered in Pensacola, and Southern Company Services
are subsidiaries of Atlanta-based Southern Co., which also has
electric utilities in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi.
   Southern Company Services agreed to pay for Hughes' damages but
without admitting liability, leaving the jury to decide only on an
amount, said James Daniel, a lawyer for the company.
   The liability issue will be decided in a separate case pending
in U.S. District Court, not expected to go to trial until next
year.
   The plane crashed just minutes after taking off from Pensacola
Regional Airport en route for Atlanta.
   Ms. Hughes' boyfriend, Tony Edward Kinley, also was in the
apartment when the plane crashed. Kinley and another resident of
the Country Walk apartment complex, Lisa Collier, also have filed
suit against Southern Company Services, but their cases have not
yet been tried.

   The government today battled leading
church officials over whether unmarried residents of nursing homes
should be allowed to have sex.
   The government said it has no intention of abandoning its new
Charter of Rights, which guarantees the sexual freedom of nursing
home residents and would withhold funding for facilities violating
the charter.
   The Little Sisters of the Poor have threatened to close down
their six nursing homes if federal funding is withdrawn over the
group's refusal to adopt the new charter. The order claimed the
government is adopting the agenda of ``militant sexual
revolutionaries.''
   ``This has not been the work of militant sexual Rambos,'' said
Peter Staples, the federal minister for aged care. ``People really
should be able to physically communicate with each other.
   The Combined Pensioners' Association has argued that nursing
home residents should enjoy basic human rights, including the
freedom to express their sexuality.

   A traffic reporter and pilot were
killed Thursday when their single-engine plane nosedived and
crashed into the embankment of a busy freeway, authorities said.
   The victims were identified as Howard Chrysler, 29, a reporter
for Metro Traffic Control, and Doug Hayden, 30, a pilot with
California Wings, which owned the Grumman aircraft used to give
traffic reports to radio and television stations.
   Metro Traffic spokeswoman Monica Zech said Chrysler had been
with the company for about a year.
   ``He was super. He was very energetic about his job. He loved
it,'' Zech said.
   Officials at California Wings, based at Montgomery Field in San
Diego, did not immediately return telephone calls to The Associated
Press.
   The plane had been circling over a minor accident on an
interstate and crashed, narrowly missing a child day-care center.
   There was no fire and very little gasoline at the scene of the
crash.
   ``I heard this whirring like there was no gas. Then I heard a
big boom,'' said 20-year-old Monica Ortega, whose home was near the
crash.
   Other witnesses said the plane nosedived so that it would not
crash into the stream of traffic on Interstate 5.
   Federal Aviation Administration and National Traffic Safety
Board officials combed the crash scene for any clues to the
accident.
   Solana Beach is about 23 miles north of San Diego.

   Democrats barely maintained control of the
U.S. House, according to the results of a mock election in which
millions of students and parents from across the nation
participated Thursday.
   Democrats won 52.9 percent of the seats in the House while
Republicans won 47.1 percent, reported officials of the National
Student-Parent Mock Election.
   In the real world, Democrats actually control more than 59
percent of the House seats, holding an edge of 258 to 176 over
Republicans. Democrats are expected to win additional seats
Tuesday.
   Sen. Jesse Helms was crushed in his re-election bid against
Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt, according to the mock election
results. Gantt got 72 percent of the vote, to 28 for Helms.
   In the California governor's race, Republican Pete Wilson
defeated Diane Feinstein, 59 percent to 37 percent.
   In Arizona, Democrat Terry Goddard won his gubernatorial race
with Republican Fife Symington, 55 percent to 45 percent.
   In Texas, Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams
defeated Democrat Ann Richards, 56 percent to 44 percent.
   And in Florida, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez lost a re-election
bid to former Sen. Lawton Chiles, 52 percent to 48 percent.
   Junior and senior high school students in all 50 states and the
Department of Defense dependents' schools called in tabulated
results to the national election headquarters in the nation's
capital.
   Questions developed by Congressional Quarterly Inc. and the
Roper Poll asked students to decide on strategies for dealing with
the nation's drug crisis.
   The results:
   -12 percent favored imposing harsher penalties for convicted
drug dealers and users.
   -9 percent wanted to require courses in public schools about the
effects of drugs use.
   -51 percent wanted to increase efforts to prevent drugs from
being brought into the United States from other countries.
   -11 percent wanted to legalize some drugs to make drug-dealing
less profitable to organized crime.
   -17 percent were undecided about what steps to take.
   On the federal budget, 62 percent wanted to maintain current
levels of defense even if it means the government has to borrow
money. Thirty percent said the United States should borrow less
money and reduce the deficit even if it means cuts in the defense
budget.
   On the federal deficit, 59 percent said the United States should
increase spending for social needs. Nineteen percent said the U.S.
should borrow less money and reduce the budget deficit even if it
means no improvements in social programs
   Twenty-six percent favored an increase in the federal gasoline
tax. Forty-seven percent were against it.
   The mock election is ``the largest voter-education program
ever,'' said Gloria Kirshner, president of the event.
   The purpose of the program, she said, is to obliterate civic
illiteracy by involving students and their families in the
electoral process.

   It was a Halloween trick all right, but was the
sight of five naked men dancing onstage with rocker Billy Idol a
treat?
   Idol told the crowd of 14,000 at Seattle Coliseum he knew
something would happen because Wednesday was the last night of the
tour - the night band members traditionally play pranks on each
other.
   Not to mention that Idol had already had 600 dead fish dumped on
Faith No More as they opened the show - in a soggy, smelly gag
spoofing one of the band's video that shows a fish flopping on the
ground.
   When the payback came, Idol grinned widely as the naked men
cavorted onstage in a conga line, wearing only masks or T-shirts
over their heads.
   Idol kept plugging away at his final song, ``Got to Be a
over,'' until the bare band danced off, then blushed a little and
broke out laughing.
   Police were called in, but by the time they arrived the
musicians had left the Coliseum and no one could prove who had
pulled the prank, Idol's publicist Rick Scott said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Growing up without a father made two-sport
professional athlete Bo Jackson appreciate his mother even more.
   ``My mom is my dad. She's the only mom and dad I know,'' Jackson
says in Sunday's issue of Parade magazine. ``Whenever she needs me,
I don't care what I'm doing, I'm gonna drop it and go to her,
'cause that's all that matters.''
   Jackson, speaking with his autobiography collaborator, Dick
Schapp, vividly recalled not having a dad when he grew up. The book
is called ``Bo Knows Bo.''
   ``We never had enough food. But at least I could beat on other
kids and steal their lunch money and buy myself something to eat,''
says Jackson, who plays football for the Los Angeles Raiders and
baseball for the Kansas City Royals.
   ``But I couldn't steal a father's hug when I needed one. I
couldn't steal a father's whipping when I needed one.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Henry Hill, the mobster-turned-informant whose
book ``Wiseguy'' inspired the movie ``GoodFellas,'' has emerged
from the federal witness protection program to review the movie
recounting his Mafia life.
   ``Martin Scorsese captures everything - good and bad - with
almost total accuracy,'' Hill writes in the December issue of
Premiere magazine. ``Had I the opportunity to direct the film
myself - if I knew anything about directing - I don't think I could
have done a better job.''
   Hill also offers his views on the portrayals by the film's
stars.
   -Robert De Niro: ``Plays (mobster ``Jimmy the Gent'') Burke as
well as Burke could play himself.''
   -Joe Pesci: ``As for Tommy DeSimone, played by Joe Pesci, the
movie actually lets him off easy, because in real life he was a
whole lot worse.''
   -Ray Liotta: ``When I finally saw the movie, I was overjoyed. I
could not believe the job that Ray had done. He played me perfectly
throughout the movie.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Jami Gertz says her role as a free-spirited
pet store worker in Carl Reiner's romantic farce ``Sibling
Rivalry'' was a welcome relief from the hard-edged roles she's
played in other films.
   ``I played a lot of hookers and vampires and drug addicts for a
while,'' Gertz said. ``I needed to lighten up.''
   Gertz, 25, debuted eight years ago as the insufferable preppy
Muffie Tepperman on the TV series ``Square Pegs.''But in such films
as ``Less Than Zero,'' ``The Lost Boys,'' and ``Crossroads,'' the
dark-eyed actress played troubled or self-destructive characters.
   Thanks to her resume of dramatic roles, Gertz had trouble
convincing Reiner she'd be good in the part.
   ``Carl didn't think I could be funny,'' she said. ``My agents
didn't think I was right. I had to beg just to get a chance to see
him.''
   In ``Sibling Rivalry,'' Gertz's character encourages her sister,
played by Kirstie Alley, to engage in an extramarital affair to
escape her boring marriage. The results are comically disastrous -
Alley's lover dies in bed beside her.
   Gertz's character fares better. She falls in love with the
policeman assigned to investigate, played by Ed O'Neill, star of
the hit TV series ``Married ... With Children.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Kadeem Hardison, who plays college geek Dwayne
Wayne on the NBC sitcom ``A Different World,'' says he took the
part only because he was sure the show would die quickly.
   ``I get restless,'' he says in this weekend's issue of USA
Weekend.
   Hardison, 25, says he figured the show would get him to
Hollywood with a little money to tide him over until he could make
it into movies.
   Now the highly rated show is in its fourth year and Hardison's
contract extends through 1993.
   ``If I just do TV, it'll be harder to get movies'' later, he
says. But he adds, ``No one has offered me anything.''

<HEAD>British Commission Recommends Changes to Divorce Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official commission is calling for a quicker
no-fault divorce law, saying what's now on the books forces couples
to ``separate or recriminate'' and makes children suffer
unnecessarily.
   ``The need to allege fault in order to obtain a quick divorce
does nothing to help the marriage but can easily raise the
temperature of the proceedings, often to the detriment of the
children,'' the Law Commission said in its report released
Thursday.
   The current law ``does nothing to support those marriages which
can and should be saved, nor does it allow marriages which are dead
to be decently buried,'' the commission said.
   Couples currently may divorce within six months, usually on
grounds of adultery or unreasonable behavior. The panel proposed
permitting no-fault divorce that can be obtained in one year and
dropping the required two-year separation.
   The body also proposed scrapping the 5-year separation and
annulment necessary when one party opposes divorce.
   The commission's proposals were immediately hailed by lawyers,
marriage counseling organizations and family groups.
   One in three British marriages ends in divorce, one of the
highest rates in Europe, according to the marriage guidance
service, Relate.
   Zelda West-Meads, a spokeswoman for Relate, said: ``We like the
proposals because the needs of children are put first.''
   The commission proposes that a couple should be allowed to seek
a divorce without assessing blame after they have spent a year
``considering and reflecting'' on whether their marriage can be
saved.
   Lord Mackay, who as Lord Chancellor is Britain's chief legal
officer, said the proposals will ``force people to look at the
consequences of the divorce for themselves and their children in
the hope that they may turn back from breaking up the marriage.''
   Sue Slipman, director of the National Council for One Parent
Families, said the proposals would allow divorces to be conducted
in a less heated manner.
   ``Divorce will not be made easier, but the new proposals should
allow greater opportunity to find agreement and consensus,'' she
said.
   The Law Commission, comprised of senior lawyers, was set up by
Parliament in 1965 to make proposals to the government for revising
outdated, obscure, or otherwise unsatisfactory laws.
   To change the divorce law, the government would have to
introduce a bill in Parliament. Law Commission recommendations
carry significant weight, but the government is not bound to follow
them.

   A judge Thursday sentenced to death a
businessman convicted in the slayings of two men, including the
videotaped shooting of one while he was tied to a tree.
   Circuit Judge James Foxman ordered Konstantinos Fotopoulos to
die in Florida's electric chair, as jurors recommended Monday.
   The only alternative punishment was life in prison without
parole for 25 years.
   Shortly after he was convicted last week, Fotopoulos, 31,
slashed his left wrist and both legs in what his attorney said was
an attempt to ``cheat'' prosecutors of their hopes to execute him.
   Fotopoulos was convicted of murdering Kevin Ramsey and Bryan
Chase, 18, Nov. 4, 1989, after Chase shot Fotopoulos' wife, Lisa
Fotopoulos, in the couple's bedroom. Prosecutors said Chase was
hired by Fotopoulos to kill his wife so he could collect on her
insurance policy. She survived.
   Prosecutors found a videotape in Fotopoulos' garage that showed
his former lover, Deidre Hunt, shooting Ramsey four times while he
was tied to a tree.
   Miss Hunt, 21, testified that Fotopoulos forced her to kill
Ramsey, 19, on Oct. 20, 1989, to ensure her cooperation in his plot
to kill his wife. She pleaded guilty in the deaths of Ramsey and
Chase and has been sentenced to death.
   Mrs. Fotopoulos is suing her husband for divorce.

<TEXT>
   For the first time in 15 years of
devastating civil war, the bomb-shattered St. Georges Hotel served
as a backdrop for a fashion show with Moslem and Christian models.
   ``This is the message we hope to carry to the people of our
country: the phoenix rising from the ashes,'' said fashion designer
Loulwa Abdel-Baki, the creator of Thursday's 30-minute program.
   Ms. Abdel-Baki, a member of the Druse Moslem sect, and 20 models
worked 20 days to clear the debris from the lobby of the
once-majestic beachside hotel for the exhibit, ``but left just
enough to remind people of what happened,'' she said.
   The show, called Kalabsha, Arabic for handcuffs, was intended to
boost the latest government efforts to dismantle Beirut's dividing
Green Line and reunite the capital, Abdel-Baki said.
   The government began effacing the divider that split the city
into Moslem and Christian halves after Syrian troops backing
President Elias Hrawi crushed rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun on
Oct. 13 to end an 11-month mutiny against the government.
   Hrawi is struggling to unite the city, securing the promise of
the main Christian and Moslem militias to leave Beirut and help
create a military-free zone.
   About 650 people, mostly women, turned out for the show,
applauding the models as they paraded on a makeshift stage under
the wrecked lobby ceiling, displaying Abdel-Baki's fall and winter
collection.
   Many were apprehensive that the loud music played during the
exhibition would send loose debris crashing down from the ceiling.
But it held.
   ``It's like a beginning of a new life, a transition from a
horrendous past to a future with a slight glimmer of hope,'' said
Christian actor Alec Khalaf.
   He drove from Christian east Beirut to the Moslem sector, where
the St. Georges is located, for the first time in 15 years, ``a
feat I never thought I would accomplish in my lifetime,'' said
Khalaf, 50.
   Abdel-Baki, 26, is a graduate of the Parsons School of Design in
New York.
   ``My clothes are designed for teen-agers, simple, neat and
elegant. I will always design for them,'' she said.
   Her models, with sultry looks, paraded dark-colored mini-skirts
topped with long jackets or brocade vests and dresses studded with
rock-size rhinestones.
   ``It doesn't matter what these ladies are wearing. Let them wear
cabbage and you'll still be impressed by the event,'' said Helene
Badaro, whose wedding party was held at the St. Georges 20 years
ago.
   ``What matters is the idea behind this fashion show, the place
and its background, the efforts of these young people and their
good intentions towards their country,'' said Mrs. Badaro, a
Christian.
   The St. Georges, a six-story hotel on the Meditteranean, had
gained international fame when it was the favorite locale of
Lebanon's government officials, legislators, diplomats and foreign
correspondents before the civil war broke out in 1975.
   After the first 19-month round of sectarian conflict was brought
to a halt by Syria's military intervention in 1976, the St. Georges
and a cluster of nearby hotels had been devastated.
   Rival militiamen had fought with hand grenades and machine guns
from room to room in the St. Georges, the 14-story Phoencia Inter
Continental and the 25-floor Holiday Inn.
   Their reconstruction would take big chunk of the $9 billion
needed to rebuild Beirut, government officials say.

<HEAD>Human Life Expectancy May Be Limited to Age 85, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An average life span of 85 years is the best
that humans can hope for, even if medical science defeats all of
the major killer diseases, researchers say in a study published
today.
   University of Chicago researcher S. Jay Olshansky said the upper
limit of human life expectancy is set because uncontrollable
effects of aging set in, causing a slow decline that slides
irreversibly into death.
   Medicine now stands helpless before this apparent design of
nature, he said.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, Olshansky and
two co-authors wrote that even if cures were found for most of the
fatal diseases, ``the natural degeneration of the body puts a cap
of about 85 years on the average age of death.''
   The conclusion differs from many other studies and some experts
on human aging disagree strongly.
   ``If we keep making progress as we have made in the past, then a
baby born today can expect to live 100 years,'' said James Vaupel
of the University of Minnesota. ``There may well be some biological
barriers, but we are spending a lot of money on biomedical research
and the sciences are poised to make some really significant
breakthroughs.''
   Olshansky said most of the major advances in life expectancy
have already been achieved through improvements in public health,
nutrition, immunization and advanced medical care. The average life
span in the United States went from 47 years in 1900 to 75 years
today.
   ``This trend is not likely to continue,'' Olshansky said. ``The
easy advances have already been made.''
   Death rates for the young and those under age 50 are now so low
that even if all dying in that age group were eliminated, the life
expectancy at birth would increase by only 3.5 years, said
Olshansky. The major killers - heart disease, cancer, stroke and
diabetes - usually strike after the age of 50.
   ``In order to increase the average life expectancy of the
population to just 85 years, we would have to achieve the
equivalent of the elimination of all deaths from heart disease and
cancer,'' Olshansky said. ``There are very few people around who
argue that is realistically possible.''
   But even controlling the major killer diseases would have little
statistical effect on the average life span, he said.
   ``Just because we eliminate major fatal disease does not mean
that we will not grow older and die. It just means that we will
grow older and die of other diseases,'' he said.
   ``Once you go beyond the age of 85, people die from multiple
organ failure. Old age, basically. And there is no cure for that,''
Olshansky said. ``We don't know why we age. But it happens. It
affects everyone. No matter what you do in terms of eliminating
these diseases it's still going to happen.''
   Vaupel said he believes the Olshansky study is too pessimistic.
   ``We are beginning to gain a fundamental understanding of aging
and we eventually may be able to slow down that process,'' he said
in a telephone interview. ``I don't see any evidence at all that
there is a cap at 85.''
   Vaupel said women in some populations already are approaching
life expectancies of 85. In Okinawa, the average life span of women
now is 83, and the life expectancy of women in some Mormon groups
is almost 85 now, he said. This was accomplished without major
medical intervention, he said.
   Another researcher, Ken Manton of Duke University, said the
Olshansky study is ``seriously flawed'' because it fails to take
into account recent research that could push life expectancy rates
upward.
   Manton said, for example, that medicine is now identifying
specific disorders of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, and is
beginning to search for cures. Such work is almost certain to
enable people to live longer, he said.
   Most experts agree that research should emphasize not just
extending life, but how to make later years more free of disease.
   ``The prospect now is that those added years will be crippling
years,'' Olshansky said. ``It is possible to alter that course of
life by going after those crippling diseases. That's what we should
be doing.''
   Olshansky said about 2 million Americans are over age 85, most
of whom require close attendance and care. If U.S. life expectancy
rises to an average of 85, he said, then there will be about 16
million people over that age.
   Olshansky's co-authors were Bruce A. Carnes of the Argonne
National Laboratory in Illinois and Christine Cassel of the
University of Chicago.

<HEAD>Roseanne Barr Signs Deal With ABC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roseanne Barr and her husband, Tom Arnold,
have signed with ABC to produce a new half-hour series, a special
and a made-for-television movie.
   Miss Barr, star of ABC's hit situation comedy ``Roseanne,'' will
not appear in front of the camera in the new, unnamed series,
``which could commence production anytime after the current 1990-91
broadcast season,'' ABC said in a statement Thursday.
   Under the couple's new agreement, Barnold Productions Inc. will
deliver a special starring Miss Barr for next year's TV season and
a two-hour movie for the 1992-93 season. The network didn't say
whether she would appear in the movie.
   The comedian, now infamous for her screeching rendition of the
national anthem before a San Diego Padres baseball game this
summer, also produces a Saturday morning cartoon series titled
``Little Rosey'' for ABC.

<HEAD>Scientists Transfer Gene to Fix Inherited Cholesterol Disorder in
Rabbits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers experimenting with laboratory
rabbits have proved that gene manipulation can be used to correct
an inherited disorder that causes high cholesterol levels and early
heart attacks.
   In a study published Thursday in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, researchers reported they were able to
transfer into rabbit liver cells a gene that temporarily corrected
a genetic defect in the liver called familial hypercholesterolimia.
   This disorder is caused by an abnormal gene that prevents the
liver from processing low density lipoprotein cholesterol, the
so-called bad cholesterol. A build up of LDL cholesterol in the
blood leads to clogged arteries, heart attack and stroke.
   A severe form of the disorder, caused by inheriting two abnormal
genes, strikes about one in every 1 million Americans and can lead
to heart attacks as young as age five. A single-gene form of the
disorder strikes about one in every 500 Americans, but produces a
milder disease. About half of the men with the mild disorder die of
heart attack by age 60.
   Dr. James Wilson, assistant professor of internal medicine at
the University of Michigan, said that he and his co-investigators
used Watanabe rabbits, a laboratory animal that inherits familial
hypercholesterolimia, to attempt to correct the disorder through
genetic engineering.
   Wilson said his group removed cells from the liver of affected
rabbits and exposed the cells to a retrovirus that carried a
correct copy of the LDL gene. The virus transferred the gene into
the cells which were then transplanted into other Watanabe rabbits.
   Within three days, said Wilson, the cholesterol levels of the
treated rabbits dropped to near normal.
   ``These rabbits can have levels of up to 700 milligrams per
decaliter of total cholesterol,'' said Wilson. A level of 200 or
more in humans is considered a health problem.
   Wilson said the transferred genes corrected the rabbits'
cholesterol defect for only two weeks. After that, he said, it
appears that the transplanted cells were killed by the rabbit
immune system. When the cells died, so did the transferred genes.
   The next experiment is to remove liver cells from Watanabe
rabbits, insert the missing gene and then return the cells to the
same rabbits. This would avoid the rejection problem, Wilson said.
   ``That technically is more difficult,'' he said. ``It was easier
to test the concept by removing the cells from one rabbit and then
transplanting the cells into another rabbit.''
   Wilson said the technique may eventually be applied to humans
who lack the correct LDL gene, but that it will take years of
laboratory tests in rabbits and perhaps in monkeys and baboons
before clinical trials could be held.
   Working with Wilson on the study were researchers at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in New York, and the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass.

<HEAD>`Endangered' Loggers Say They Need Same Protection as Spotted Owls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest loggers are adopting a new strategy
in their battle with protectors of the northern spotted owl - if
you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
   The Washington Contract Loggers' Association has asked the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service to declare its 600 members an endangered
species.
   ``It's a type of man-bites-dog story, or man bites owl,'' group
leader Bill Pickell told reporters at the National Press Club on
Thursday. ``This is serious.''
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared the owl to be a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in June,
meaning it now is illegal to kill the rare bird or destroy its
critical habitat.
   As a result, the government predicts timber harvests in the
region's old-growth forests will fall as much as 50 percent by the
end of the decade at a cost of 20,000 timber jobs.
   The loggers filed their own petition with the service on Oct.
15, asking that they be declared an endangered species worthy of
the same kind of protection under the 17-year-old law.
   ``Our belief is the language is broad enough to allow the
listing of a population of human beings,'' said Mark Rutzick, an
attorney for the group. ``There is no language in the Endangered
Species Act to exclude humans.''
   Pickell said the message was well received Thursday during a
meeting with members of President Bush's White House domestic
policy staff. He said Interior Deputy Assistant Secretary John
Schrote assured him the request would be considered seriously.
   ``We are here to bring public awareness to the destructiveness
of the Endangered Species Act on the people of the Northwest
through the listing of the spotted owl as a threatened species,''
Pickell said.
   ``Otherwise there might not be any loggers on the Olympic
Peninsula. They may become fast-food workers in Southern California
or autoworkers in Detroit,'' he said.
   The idea of listing humans as endangered has been tried before.
The Samish Indian Tribe sought such protection in 1987 when it
became frustrated in attempts to gain federal recognition as a
tribe.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service denied that petition, saying that
humans do not qualify for listing under the Endangered Species Act
because they do not constitute a ``wild animal.''

   Australia and New Zealand will send
military tracking aircraft on flights over the South Pacific to
spot fishing boats using so-called ``wall of death'' driftnet
techniques, the government said today.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said the flights of Lockheed Orions by
both air forces will coincide with the fishing season, from Dec. 1
to March.
   ``It was in response to this pressure, earlier this year, that
Japan suspended driftnet fishing operations in the South Pacific,''
Hawke said. ``Taiwan has also reduced its fleet numbers but has
indicated that it will continue some driftnet fishing this
season.''
   Driftnets hang more than 30 feet below the surface and stretch
as far as 35 miles. Critics say they indiscriminately trap and kill
fish, thousands of marine mammals and 800,000 birds a year.

<HEAD>Democrats Angry Over GOP Mailing Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are threatening to take Republicans
to court over schemes they say are meant to intimidate minority
voters in North Carolina, Texas and possibly elsewhere.
   But the Republican National Committee countered that the threat
is a scheme to drum up minority turnout on Election Day.
   ``This unsupportable scare tactic by the Democrats is nothing
more than part of their annual get-out-the vote plan,'' said RNC
spokeswoman Leslie Goodman.
   The North Carolina Senate and Texas governor contests are so
tight that Democrats are counting on minority turnout to put them
over the top.
   Democratic Party strategists said Thursday they were trying to
publicize the GOP mailings in order to counter the fear they may
induce among voters. They acknowledged it was possible that a
backlash could drive up minority turnout.
   The Democratic officials requested an immediate Justice
Department investigation into GOP ``ballot security'' programs and
said they were contacting the court that issued a 1982 consent
decree banning such tactics.
   ``We will move quickly on this. We're not about to abide it,''
said Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National
Committee. ``We keep fighting this same stupid battle. It's enough
already.''
   He and others said local and state Republican organizations were
sending postcards with misleading or false information to heavily
black sections of North Carolina and East Texas.
   Party chairman Ron Brown said the GOP has used similar tactics
through the past decade despite agreeing in 1982 and 1986 not to do
so.
   He told Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in a hand-delivered
letter that activity in North Carolina and Texas ``may be just the
tip of the iceberg'' and asked for a quick examination of possible
civil rights violations.
   Brown also reminded all 50 state Republican chairmen in a letter
that the 1982 consent decree bars ``ballot intimidation and ballot
security activities.'' He noted that the Orange County (Calif.)
Republican Party last year paid a $400,000 settlement after being
sued for intimidating Hispanic voters in 1988.
   Goodman said the RNC ``has nothing to do with the ballot
security program in North Carolina, Texas or anywhere else.''
   Rick Shelby, political director of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, called the flap ``much ado about nothing.''
He said ballot security is a standard operating procedure in many
campaigns and is just getting more publicity in North Carolina than
elsewhere.
   ``It's merely an effort to ensure that it's a fair, honest
election,'' Shelby said.
   Among the evidence the Democrats presented Thursday:
   -A copy of the postcard mailed to voters in heavily black North
Carolina precincts, saying people must contact the Board of
Elections if they recently moved and must have lived in a precinct
for the last 30 days or they can't vote. Brown said the postcards
contained fraudulent information. In fact, the Democrats say,
voters who have moved may either go to the Board of Elections
before they vote or to the precinct in which they are registered on
election day and get transferred to the precinct where they now
live.
   -Copies of postcards sent to elderly Texans in Gregg County who
had requested absentee ballots. The cards urged them to `throw that
mail ballot in the trash'' and ``walk proudly into the voting place
... in honor of the many who fought and died for your right to walk
into the polls.''
   Brown said that in Texas, once someone requests an absentee
ballot, they cannot vote in person without going through a
complicated procedure to cancel the absentee ballot.
   -A copy of a Helms fund-raising letter seeking money to conduct
ballot security activities, and a copy of a GOP campaign finance
reform proposal that listed ballot security as a party-building
activity eligible for federal funds. The May 1990 proposal did not
become law.

<HEAD>GOP Worried About Potential Impact of Low Voter Turnout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans are worried that a turned-off
electorate will stay home next Tuesday and spell disaster for many
GOP candidates.
   ``A low turnout doesn't help us,'' said Edward J. Rollins,
co-chairman of the National Republican Campaign Committee.
   Rollins' assessment was echoed by Norman Cummings, political
director of the Republican National Committee, who said, ``Those
marginal voters are Republican-leaning voters in many key states.''
   Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate, said the outlook for voter turnout is ``a more
iffy situation this year'' than in most midterm elections. But he
predicted that turnout on Tuesday would be about the same as four
years ago.
   In the 1986 midterm election, 36.4 percent of eligible voters
went to the polls, the lowest turnout since 1942.
   Gans said there has been a slight increase in Republican voter
registration, but it might not translate into a larger Republican
vote.
   ``My own guess is that overall, because of ... taxes and an
incipient recession, there'll be a decline of slight proportions
despite the increase in registration in the Republican vote
nationally,'' he said.
   ``You could have a phenomena in a number of places, the sort of
lower middle class, urban ethnic who's been sort of a swing vote in
recent elections coming back to the Democratic Party,'' Gans said.
``That's what happened in the recession of 1982; it might happen
with the fear of a recession plus the fairness issue this year.''
   A consistent theme in Democratic campaigns around the country
has been to portray their candidates as advocates of economic
fairness for all Americans and Republicans as protectors of the
rich.
   Rollins noted that younger voters are the most anti-tax group in
the population and that a majority of Republicans today are under
40, while a majority of Democrats are over 40.
   Those demographics bring together two factors that could give an
edge to Democrats on Election Day.
   The anti-tax voters were the ones turned off when President Bush
abandoned his hard-line opposition to any tax increases. Older
Americans have the highest percentage of voter turnout.
   Republicans hope that in the final days before the election,
Bush will succeed in firing up Republican voters and inspiring them
to go to the polls on Tuesday.
   ``In the last days of any midterm election that's the benefit
(of a president),'' said Rollins. ``If he can convince enough
Republicans to turn out and vote, then it benefits.''
   Bush plans to campaign non-stop before winding up Tuesday in
Houston, where he maintains his voting residence.
   In a report on voter registration, Gans said that national
registration should total about 122.6 million, an increase of
nearly 3 million over 1986, but one that did not keep pace with the
population growth.
   Nine states and the District of Columbia reported increases in
registered voters. They were Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Nevada, North Carolina, Texas and Wyoming.
   ``All of this points to a generally low turnout election with
spotty surges in individual states with either hotly contested or
races of state and/or national significance,'' said Gans.

<HEAD>Transportation Board Blames Faulty Inspection in 1989 Iowa Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines is disputing U.S. safety
investigators' finding that it should have detected the tiny flaw
in a critical engine part that disintegrated, causing the 1989 Iowa
crash that killed 112 people.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday the
probable cause of the crash of United Flight 232 at Sioux City,
Iowa, was ``human factors limitations'' in United's inspection and
quality control procedures. The board issued the finding without
dissent.
   Board members said that because none of hundreds of similar
tests conducted over many years on similar parts had ever found a
defect, laxity on the part of inspectors was to be expected.
   Reporting on a year-long investigation, the safety board said
United's inspectors missed a fatigue crack in a critical area of a
titanium fan disk in the tail engine of the DC-10 aircraft.
   The plane, en route from Denver to Chicago, crashed 40 minutes
after metal from its exploding tail engine shredded the hydraulic
system used to control flight operations.
   But United officials who attended the hearing said blame should
have been placed on General Electric Aircraft Engines, which
manufactured the part at its Evendale, Ohio, plant in 1971.
   United officials rejected the board's conclusion, saying there
is no evidence that a half-inch crack in the bore area of the fan
disk could have been detected when the part was last inspected in
April 1988.
   ``GE gave us a bum part,'' said Bob Doll, United's vice
president for engineering and quality assurance.
   Doll said the safety board's staff did not understand the
airline's statements on its inspection system or the zeal with
which he said inspectors look for defects.
   Stephen M. Wolf, the airline's chairman and president, said in a
statement: ``United, which has complied fully with this
investigation, vigorously disputes the NTSB's ... finding as it
pertains to our maintenance procedures.''
   ``United's rigorous maintenance procedures were in full
compliance with all federal regulations and all mandated
manufacturer's requirements,'' Wolf said.
   After metal from the disintegrating tail engine on the DC-10
disabled all three hydraulic systems, the three-man flight crew,
joined by another United pilot who was a passenger on the flight,
alternated the thrust of the remaining two engines to partially
control the aircraft and guide it to the airport at Sioux City.
   The plane crashed when they attempted to land, killing 112
people. But 184 passengers and crew members survived, a fact some
board members attributed to the skill and ``exquisite'' teamwork on
the part of the pilots.
   The safety board concluded that a flaw in the fan disk, which
later caused a half-inch long crack in a vital area of the engine
part, was formed during manufacture of the titanium ingot from
which the disk was forged.
   It said the crack could have been detected in the disk's most
recent inspection by United.
   James Wildey, a metallurgist who assisted in the investigation,
called the flaw ``a buried defect'' and added: ``That defect has
been in there since day one.''
   ``There is no way to introduce this kind of defect through
operaions or anything else,'' he said.
   Merritt Birky, a chemical research investigator, said United
should have found the crack with normal inspection procedures. He
noted that fluorescent chemicals used to detect flaws during
inspections of engine parts were found on the failed disk and that
they should have warned of a defect.
   The safety board investigates all major transportation accidents
in the United States. It has no actual enforcement powers but can
only investigate, issue conclusions and make recommendations for
safety improvements.

<TEXT>
   Iraqis feeling the squeeze from the U.N.
embargo are changing their eating habits, lifestyle and even
rediscovering herbal medicine.
   Three months after Iraq invaded Kuwait and the United Nations
retaliated with the trade cutoff, Baghdad is beginning to feel its
isolation. The pains, although minor, are adding up.
   ``You want to know if the embargo is effective. Yes it is
effective,'' Information Minister Latif Jassim, told reporters.
``You know we want to build our country but we cannot buy. We
cannot sell anymore.''
   Faulty traffic lights in Baghdad can't be repaired because of a
lack of spare parts. Many taxis and cars have broken windscreens
that can't be replaced.
   TV announcers tell Iraqis not to waste food or overeat.
   The lines at bread stores and government-run shops selling
rationed food are becoming longer every day.
   Restaurants are closing down because they are no longer
profitable. At those that remain open, food portions have been
reduced; a chicken leg now is served as two portions.
   ``Yes, an average Iraqi has started feeling the impact of the
embargo, but only at a pinch, not serious biting,'' an Asian
diplomat said. Still, he says many industries short on materials
have been forced to lay off workers.
   Merchants admit that prices have risen five to six times since
the embargo, and the government has listed 12 lifesaving
antibiotics that can be obtained only in state-run hospitals.
   ``We are telling our people to look at our history and realize
that we have successfully solved several problems like this,'' said
Ihsan al-Rawi, managing director of the government-run herbal
medicine section.
   ``We are encouraging people to use herbal medicine more and
more. This is in many ways better than the Western medicine,'' said
al-Rawi, whose center displays 65 types of herbal medicines.
   Western and Asian diplomats in Baghdad agree it will take at
least three to four months for the embargo to have any serious
impact.
   Prior to the U.N. sanctions, Iraq relied heavily on food imports
that cost an average $3 billion a year. The United States sold Iraq
food valued at more than $1 billion a year, mostly wheat, rice,
corn, vegetable oil, livestock and dairy products.
   ``To fight the embargo we are trying to change our food habits''
said an Iraqi restaurant owner who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``Before, we were eating rice both for lunch and dinner; now only
once, for lunch.''
   Said another Iraqi: ``Our Friday breakfast, which used to be all
fun, is not fun anymore.''
   Iraqis love to eat kabd, or liver curry with bread, milk cream
and cheese as their Friday breakfast.
   ``We can't manage it anymore. Now breakfast is just bread, and
once in a while an egg'' said the man, who also spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   However, there are signs that fresh and dried fruit have started
arriving from Iran, once Iraq's fiercest foe. Iranian apples are in
great demand in Baghdad's market.
   Iraqi traders regularly visit Kuwait with bags full of dinars
and come back with everything from cartons of Marlboro cigarettes
to washing machines.
   A pack of Marlboros costs $18 on the official exchange rate.
That's also the price of 2.2 pounds of beef.
   The monthly average salary is $500 on the official exchange
rate.
   Since August, the Agriculture Cooperative Bank has provided
credits worth about $30 million to farmers cultivating wheat,
barley and what Iraqis call ``other strategic crops,'' meaning
basic food items.
   Beer production has been curtailed so that barley used in
brewing can be used as staple food.
   The government has started 1,078 livestock farms to feed its 18
million people, and state-run television regularly shows programs
on how to increase agricultural production. Landowners have been
told they run the risk of losing their land if they don't cultivate
it.
   Where the embargo is hurting most is on Iraqi industry.
   ``In a secretive country like Iraq it is near impossible to find
out how seriously affected the industrial sector is,'' the Asian
diplomat said.
   But the diplomat, who has some access to information, said many
cement, tire, fertilizer and cigarette factories have either closed
down or work much below capacity.
   A car tire now costs from $300 to $400 in Baghdad.
   It is hard to detect whether Iraqis blamed their government for
the growing economic hardship. The state-run media regularly blames
the United States for all problems.
   ``It is Satan America which is to be blamed, no one else,'' is
the common view.

   When 19-year-old Carlos Guity sprints out under
the big top of the Big Apple circus and executes a series of double
back somersaults and flips each night, he is fulfilling a dream
from his South Bronx childhood.
   As one of only two black members of a troupe comprised of
generations of circus performers, the acrobat and tumbler sees
himself as a symbol for those from rough-and-tumble neighborhoods
who beat the odds.
   ``A lot of people don't realize there's a lot of talent in these
neighborhoods, not just crimes or drugs,'' he said Thursday.
   One of hundreds of inner-city youths recruited by a Big Apple
training program that began in 1979, Guity stuck with it for 11
years. Now he's the first circus school graduate to be hired as a
regular performer for Big Apple.
   Seeing friends from the neighborhood destroyed by drugs only
fueled Guity's desire to succeed.
   ``You see people you've known through the years get hooked on
crack and you see them falling apart,'' he said. ``For me, watching
them gave me more motivation to stick with this and set goals.''
   Guity also found something special in the circus that made him
succeed where others failed.
   ``I liked it more than the other kids,'' he recalled. ``I saw
something special in it. I liked the idea of going to the circus
and seeing something that looks impossible - but knowing that if
you keep working at it, you can do it.''
   Guity, who joined the circus school at age 8, spent six years
perfecting the double back flip, his most difficult move.
   ``Any normal kid would probably say, `I don't want to do this
anymore,''' he said. ``But I think the best things come to people
who wait.''
   His career suffered a setback four years ago when Big Apple
acrobat and aerialist Phil Beder fell while performing on a
rotating ladder and became a quadriplegic.
   ``I owe everything to him,'' said Guity. ``He motivated me
physically and emotionally to this day.''
   Guity, who has avoided serious injury, says he will stick with
ground performances and isn't interested in aerial work.
   He is interested in accounting, though, and is studying at
Lehman College in the Bronx, where he is a sophomore. When it's
time to retire from tumbling, he'd like to stay with the circus as
an accountant. He already works part-time in that capacity for Big
Apple's corporate offices.
   Now, with the circus about to leave New York on tour, Guity is
torn between staying in school or going along.
   He says he doesn't want to neglect his studies, but the more he
performs with the circus, the more he likes it.
   ``They're very friendly here,'' he said. ``The circus is one
place where it's like a family. There's no discrimination. Everyone
just wants to work together to put on a good show.''

<HEAD>Write-In Campaign Could Push Governor's Race into Runoff, But Then
What?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arizona law passed in reaction to the
impeachment and ouster of Gov. Evan Mecham could trigger a runoff
election for governor if no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote
Tuesday.
   If Tuesday's election is close between Democrat Terry Goddard
and Republican Fife Symington, write-in candidate Max Hawkins, a
former Mecham confidante and aide, could garner just enough to
force such a vote.
   Goddard leads Symington 44 to 38 percent, according to the
latest polling, with Hawkins getting 4 percent of the vote.
   Arizona is the only state in the country with a post-general
election runoff, said Karen Osborne, assistant secretary of state.
   ``Max Hawkins is a non-factor in the race, and it will be
settled Nov. 6,'' Symington said.
   ``Should fate deal us an unusual hand, I'd just live with it,''
he added.
   Mecham won election in 1986 with 40 percent of the vote in a
three-way race. After a tumultuous reign, he was convicted in a
Senate trial on two of three impeachment charges and was removed
from office in April 1988.
   Voters changed the constitution that fall to require a runoff
election when no candidate receives a majority.
   But election officials doubt that a runoff could be arranged
before the first Monday in January. That's when the new governor is
to take office. The regular legislative session begins the
following Monday.
   ``Going into a (legislative) session and not having a governor
sworn in is a little scary,'' Goddard said.
   Arizona law says the governor will remain in office until a
qualified successor is elected, said John Shadegg, an assistant
Arizona attorney general. That would extend the tenure of Rose
Mofford, who as secretary of state became governor when Mecham was
removed.
   ``We just don't have any guidelines on a special election after
a general election,'' Pima County Elections Director Larry Bahill
said.
   There is no provision for absentee voting in a runoff election,
said Mrs. Osborne and Helen Purcell, Maricopa County recorder. It
also isn't clear whether ballots can be cast in runoff elections by
voters who didn't vote in the preceding general election.
   Election officials lobbied lawmakers last session for amendments
to specify how and when runoffs are to be held. The proposals
weren't approved.
   Write-in candidates rarely draw more than a few hundred votes,
but Hawkins could be different because he could draw votes from the
15 percent that staunchly has supported Mecham.
   Mecham, whose own comeback candidacy failed in the GOP primary,
said he plans to vote for Symington.
   Goddard and Symington said they hadn't planned for the runoff
possibility.
   The lead time to set up a runoff election is for planning it,
determining who would be eligible to vote, printing ballots, hiring
workers and scheduling polling places.

<HEAD>A Fifth of California Vote Expected to Be Absentee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About one-fifth of the Californians
who will vote in Tuesday's election are expected to cast absentee
ballots, a development that could delay announcement of the
results, says the secretary of state's office.
   Most absentee ballots are counted as part of the election-night
semi-official results. But a substantial percentage are received on
election day and won't be part of the election-night count.
   ``If we have 500,000 absentee ballots outstanding, it could take
a couple of weeks to count them,'' said Melissa Warren, a
spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office. Between 7 million
and 8 million people are expected to vote in California on Tuesday.
   A large number of absentee ballots could have a significant
impact on the outcome of the race for governor and on when the
winner is known. Two independent polls published Thursday found
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson leading Democratic former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein by just one percentage point.
   ``We are expecting the absentee turnout to be substantial, which
could complicate the vote-counting process'' and could put off
announcing the results, Warren said.
   In June 1990, about 15 percent of voters used absentee ballots.
In the last general election, November 1988, about 14 percent voted
absentee, Warren said.

   It'll be easy for the mother of state Sen.

   The polling place is on her porch.
   ``They have always voted on my mother's and father's back

   ``I never go close to the place on Election Day. No one is

   There aren't many other places to put the booth in tiny Kieffer,

   Brackenrich's Republican opponent, Fred Sampson, said he'd feel
better if the booth wasn't in enemy territory.
   ``It looks kind of funny for a voting place to be in his
mother's home. I guess I have to trust the county officials to make

   Packets containing white powder have been
mailed to 18,000 households by a state legislative candidate hoping
to impress on voters the seriousness of the drug problem.
   ``This is not cocaine. But it could be,'' says a brochure sent
with the plastic pouch of flour and powdered sugar. The brochures
tell residents that drugs have become pervasive in schools,
businesses and elsewhere.
   The mailing by Republican James M. Harkins, one of four

<HEAD>FBI Says Inmate Who Claimed KKK Murders Failed Polygraphs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI says it dropped an investigation into
a convicted murderer's allegations that the bodies of black people
killed by the Ku Klux Klan were buried in a mass grave in Fauquier
County, Va.
   The case was closed after the Nevada inmate who made the
allegations, Edward Allan See, 43, failed a polygraph test this
week, authorities said Thursday.
   FBI officials began looking into the claims in February after
See, who is serving two consecutive life sentences at Ely State
Prison, told them 50 people were buried in the Warrenton area, 45
miles southwest of Washington.
   See, who failed part of a polygraph test administered by the FBI
in March, also flunked the second test, which was administered
Tuesday at Ely, authorities said.
   ``Based on that information we received today, we have
discounted the information provided by Mr. See to date and no
further investigation will be done,'' said Thomas F. Jones, FBI
public affairs chief. ``A second polygraph was given and an
evaluation and review of that led us to believe that no further
reaction is required in this matter.''
   William F. Dwyer, a Beverly Hills, Calif., attorney who
represents See, said he was disappointed by the FBI's decision. He
urged the bureau to verify or discredit See's claims by excavating
the alleged grave site.
   He also said See wanted an independent polygraph test.
   ``If the FBI has chosen to close the investigation based on
Eddie See's polygraph examination, then it appears sweat (affecting
the polygraph) is considered more reliable than a backhoe in
unearthing what may or may not be buried remains of Klan
killings,'' Dwyer said.
   See claims he participated in the killings of several blacks
abducted from the Washington area, tortured and killed. He says he
was a member of the Klan from 1961 to 1964.

<HEAD>Jury Levies No Punitive Damages Against Tyson in Fondling Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman who convinced a jury that boxer Mike
Tyson grabbed her breasts and behind in a disco said she doesn't
mind that she won only $100 in damages.
   ``It was the principle,'' Sandra Miller said Thursday after the
jury declined to award her any punitive damages. ``He knows he did
it. I know he did it. The jury proved that he did it.''
   The jury on Wednesday ordered the former heavyweight champion to
pay Miller $100 in compensatory damages after finding that he
grabbed Miller's breasts and buttocks when she refused his advances
at Bentley's disco in Manhattan on Dec. 10, 1988.
   Tyson testified during a four-day trial that he never touched
Miller.
   Miller, 26, had sought $1 million in compensatory damages and
$2.5 million in punitive damages.
   She said she believed Tyson would keep hassling women.
   ``He should have been punished,'' she said. ``He hasn't learned
his lesson. There's no stopping Mike Tyson.''
   Tyson supporters, including boxing promoter Don King, swarmed
around him in the courtroom Thursday, congratulating him on the
small damage award.
   Jurors left the courthouse without talking to reporters.
   The jury had heard testimony that Tyson's net worth was $15
million and listened to another woman claim the boxer had reached
under her dress the same night.
   U.S. District Court Judge Michael B. Mukasey allowed Miller's
attorney, Alan Clark, to present testimony about the other incident
to show that his client's claims were not isolated.
   The second woman, Lori Davis, testified that she felt someone
clutch under her dress as she was dancing at Bentley's.
   She turned and warned him not to try it again, she said. ``Then
it dawned on me that it was Mike Tyson. ... He was grabbing my
butt. I felt humiliated, violated, disgraced and petrified.''
   Davis, 31, has a $7 million lawsuit against Tyson pending in
state court.
   Under questioning by his attorney, Robert Hirth, Tyson said he
felt no ill will toward women. He said: ``My mother's a woman and
my sister's a woman.''

<HEAD>Helms, Feinstein Lose In Mock Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was glum news for Republican Jesse Helms
and Democrat Dianne Feinstein as millions of students and their
parents cast ballots in nationwide mock balloting.
   Helms, the North Carolina senator, and California gubernatorial
candidate Feinstein were among the losers Thursday in the National
Student-Parent Mock Election.
   A surprise: Democrats barely maintained control of the U.S.
House, organizers reported.
   Democrats captured 52.9 percent of the seats in the House while
Republicans won 47.1 percent.
   In the real world, Democrats actually control more than 59
percent of the House seats, holding an edge of 258 to 176 over
Republicans. Democrats are likely to increase their edge Tuesday.
   In the mock balloting, Helms was crushed in his bid for another
term by Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt, 72 percent to 28
percent.
   In Oregon, Sen. Mark Hatfield won against challenger Harry
Lonsdale, 61 percent to 31 percent.
   In governor's races:
   -Republican Pete Wilson defeated Feinstein in California, 59
percent to 37 percent.
   -In Arizona, Democrat Terry Goddard won against Republican Fife
Symington, 55 percent to 45 percent.
   -In Texas, Republican Clayton Williams defeated Democrat Ann
Richards, 56 percent to 44 percent.
   -And in Florida, Republican Gov. Bob Martinez lost a re-election
bid to former Sen. Lawton Chiles, 52 percent to 48 percent.
   Junior and senior high school students in all 50 states and the
Department of Defense dependents' schools called in tabulated
results to the national election headquarters in the nation's
capital.
   Questions developed by Congressional Quarterly Inc. and the
Roper Poll asked participants to decide on strategies for dealing
with the nation's drug crisis.
   The results:
   -Twelve percent favored harsher penalties for convicted drug
dealers and users.
   -Nine percent wanted to require courses in public schools about
the effects of drugs use.
   -Fifty-one percent wanted to increase efforts to prevent drugs
from being brought into the United States from other countries.
   -Eleven percent wanted to legalize some drugs to make
drug-dealing less profitable to organized crime.
   On the federal budget, 62 percent wanted to maintain current
levels of defense even if it means the government has to borrow
money. Thirty percent said the United States should borrow less
money and reduce the deficit even if it means cuts in the defense
budget.
   On the federal deficit, 59 percent said the United States should
increase spending for social needs. Nineteen percent said the U.S.
should borrow less money and reduce the budget deficit even if it
means no improvements in social programs
   Twenty-six percent favored an increase in the federal gasoline
tax. Forty-seven percent were against it.
   The mock election is ``the largest voter-education program
ever,'' said Gloria Kirshner, president of the event.
   The purpose of the program, she said, is to obliterate civic
illiteracy by involving students and their families in the
electoral process.

<TEXT>
   Testimony in Round 2 of a comatose woman's
right-to-die case ended without any opposition to letting her die.
   Her doctor and her state-appointed guardian agreed with family
members and friends of 33-year-old Nancy Cruzan, who has been in an
irreversible coma since 1983.
   Dr. James C. Davis, who opposed removing a feeding tube when the
family first sought court permission to let her die three years
ago, changed his mind. He said during a Circuit Court hearing
Thursday he favored the mercy death because he was convinced there
was no hope for any improvement.
   He said living for years in a coma, without feeling or thought,
was a terrifying prospect.
   ``I think it would be personally a living hell,'' Davis said.
   Asked if he would want someone to end his life if he were in her
place, Davis replied: ``I think anyone would choose that if they
had observed that condition.''
   The U.S. Supreme Court, in its first right-to-die decision, last
summer rejected a request by Ms. Cruzan's parents to end her life,
ruling the state could bar such moves if victims had not made their
desires known.
   Ms. Cruzan left no written instructions about what she would
want done under such circumstances.
   The family went back to court, saying they had new witnesses who
could support their claims that she would want to die.
   Judge Charles E. Teel, who ruled in the parents' favor before he
was overruled, said he would rule on the new petition by Jan. 1.
   Joe Cruzan testified he knew his daughter would rather die than
spend the rest of her life as a ``vegetable.''
   ``My God, I wouldn't be here today if I thought there was any
question,'' he said, his voice cracking.
   Two former co-workers and a former employer also said Ms. Cruzan
told them she would not want to live if she ever suffered permanent
brain damage.
   She went into a coma after a 1983 car crash. Doctors say she
will never recover but could remain alive for 30 years or more in
her currentcondition. Ms. Cruzan's state-appointed guardian said
he agreed with the Cruzans and her personal physician that the
feeding tube should be removed.
   ``I think it clearly is not in her best interest to go on this
way,'' said the guardian, Thad McCanse. ``I'm convinced Nancy would
not want to live like she is now.''
   Debi Havner, who now lives in Enid, Okla., and Marianne Smith of
Joplin, testified that while working with in 1978 at a school for
severely handicapped children in Joplin, the three once agreed none
of them would not want to be kept alive artificially.
   Tom Turner, the former owner of an Oklahoma office products
store where Ms. Cruzan worked briefly in 1981, said in videotaped
testimony that she also discussed her opposition to certain
life-sustaining measures with him.
   ``She said such things as `Vegetables can't hug their nieces,'''
Turner said. ``Her family was a major portion of her life, and if
she couldn't have them, she didn't want to live.''

<TEXT>
   Academy Award voters aren't likely to give it
a second look, but those who love horror Hollywood style are in for
a rare treat. Roger Corman is back.
   For the first time in nearly 20 years, the director of such B
movies as ``Attack of the Crab Monsters,'' ``Wasp Woman,''
``Teen-age Caveman'' and ``She-Gods of Shark Reef'' returned to the
movie-set hot seat.
   ``Frankenstein Unbound,'' Corman's fresh look at the classic
Mary Shelley novel, opens today. Unlike Corman's earlier low-budget
films, which featured little-known actors, ``Frankenstein Unbound''
boasts the marquee names of John Hurt, Raul Julia and Bridget
Fonda.
   Corman, 64, last directed a film, the World War I drama ``Von
Richthofen and Brown,'' in 1971.
   ``About halfway through filming it, I just realized I was
getting tired,'' Corman said in an interview. ``I had directed more
than 50 films in something like 15 or 16 years.
   ``I never intended to stop directing. What I wanted to do was
take the traditional sabbatical.''
   But it was not to be. Corman went on to produce scores of films,
including ``Boxcar Bertha,'' ``Piranha'' and ``Humanoids From the
Deep.''
   Corman is credited with giving early breaks to aspiring
Hollywood newcomers such as Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone,
Martin Scorsese, Charles Bronson and Ellen Burstyn.
   Among his better known films are ``The Masque of the Red
Death,'' ``The Tomb of Ligeia'' and ``The Raven,'' all adapted from
Edgar Allan Poe tales.
   He also made the original ``The Little Shop of Horrors,''
featuring Nicholson, in 1960.
   Corman, who co-wrote and co-produced ``Frankenstein Unbound,''
says the film budgeted at $9 million doesn't truly fit into the
horror category, though it depicts disemboweled animals,
decapitations, impalings and a gruesome monster.
   ``It's not really a horror film, not quite,'' Corman said.
``It's really a kind of science fiction-fantasy-horror with a
little bit of a moral point.''
   Corman said his two-decade absence from behind the camera
worried him at first.
   ``As we're driving out to the set for the first day of filming,
I thought, Am I really going to be able to pull this off?'' Corman
said.
   Problems surfaced quickly.
   ``We get there, the cameras weren't ready. I immediately said,
`All right, fellas. I told you I want the camera on the dolly over
here. Let's lay the track, get the camera out, that wall over there
is not dressed, let's bring in the props, let's get this thing
moving,'' he said.
   ``I didn't even think about it until somebody brought me some
coffee a few minutes later. And I realized, I'm just working again.
It's as if I had stopped working last Friday.''
   Corman says he'll direct again, but for now he's off to Europe,
where ``Frankenstein Unbound'' will the opening night feature at
the first Stockholm Film Festival.
   The onetime lord of low-budget movie fare still has an eye for a
good deal.
   ``They sent me a ticket,'' he said. ``And I figured I might as
well go.''

<HEAD>Survey Finds Students Drinking Water Containing Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators believe hundreds of
thousands of children continue to drink water containing lead at
school despite laws aimed at reducing lead contamination.
   States have failed to enforce laws requiring schools to test
drinking water for lead and the government has not provided
adequate guidance on what water coolers pose a health risk,
according to an Environmental Protection Agency report made
available Thursday.
   Lead is a powerful poison. Even traces can be harmful to
children because it can hurt development of the brain and nervous
system. Children under 7 are considered particularly vulnerable.
   The EPA inspector general's office estimated that, based on a
limited survey, fewer than half of the school districts in the
country may be testing thoroughly.
   An examination of 13 school districts in the mid-Atlantic region
revealed that three had not tested for lead while most of the
others conducted inadequate tests.
   ``Our findings confirm that harmful amounts of lead exist in the
drinking water provided by schools. Both the EPA and the states
must be more aggressive in eliminating the health hazard imposed by
lead in drinking water,'' said the report.
   Three of the school districts - Pittsburgh, Richmond, Va., and
Charleston, W.Va. - had not tested for lead at the time of the
survey. The investigation was finished in April and the report
completed in September.
   The EPA considers lead concentrations above 20 parts per billion
to be hazardous to school children. The report said that the agency
believes every year more than 250,000 children are exposed to lead
level in drinking water that are high enough to impair their
intellectual and physical development.

   Rep. Raymond J. McGrath, R-N.Y., has been
discharged from a hospital where he was treated over the last week
for a blood clot in the lung.
   ``He's under strict doctor's orders to get plenty of rest,''
press secretary Dan Zielinski said. He said McGrath plans to go to

   McGrath is taking blood-thinning drugs and must have his blood
checked daily for the next week.
   He was hospitalized after becoming ill in his Capitol Hill

diagnosed a pulmonary embolism, or a blockage in a blood vessel in
the lung.
   McGrath, 48, of Valley Stream, is running for a sixth term from

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission says
Fisher-Price is recalling about 60,000 of its Carriage Strollers,
Model No. 9121, because they have been known to collapse with
children in them.
   Side tubes have failed to slide properly in some cases when the
stroller unfolded. This can prevent the locking mechanism from
engaging fully. Fisher-Price said it is aware of 23 injuries to
children using the strollers, ranging from bumps and bruises to one
broken arm.
   The strollers have been sold since June 1989, for about $120 to
$140.
   Consumers who own this stroller should call Fisher-Price,
toll-free, at 1-800-527-1034 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily, in
most time zones.
   Fisher-Price will send consumers a prepaid mailing package with
instructions to return a wheel from their stroller. Those who
return a wheel will receive a new Carriage Stroller free of charge.
The new stroller will be modified to assure the locking mechanism
will engage fully.
   Consumers should not return strollers to the store where it was
purchased.
   Fisher-Price, of East Aurora, N.Y., no longer manufactures or
sells this product.

<HEAD>LaRouche Says He And Cellmate Jim Bakker Were Victims Of Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imprisoned political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche recently had fallen television evangelist Jim Bakker for a
cellmate but says he's happy to be in a new cell with fewer
visitors.
   Bakker and LaRouche spent a month together in a 10-by-16-foot
cinder-block cell in the federal penitentiary in Rochester, Minn.,
where both are serving lengthy terms for fraud and conspiracy
convictions in separate cases.
   LaRouche told The Herald of Rock Hill in a telephone interview
published today that he and Bakker were compatible, but he's
relieved to have a new cellmate now.
   He said Bakker, founder of the PTL television ministry, gets a
lot of mail and has a ``big retinue of admirers (within the prison)
who would constantly come around.''
   LaRouche, a longtime proponent of intricate conspiracy theories,
insisted that he and Bakker were innocent victims of secret plots
by the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   ``There's been a targeting of anyone or any group which had
independent financing, which had political clout, and Jim's group
was getting political clout,'' LaRouche said.
   A four-time fringe presidential candidate currently running for
the seat in Virginia's 10th Congressional District, LaRouche, 68,
is serving a 15-year sentence on mail and tax fraud charges. He
masterminded a plot to siphon millions of dollars from three
corporations forced into bankruptcy.
   Bakker, 49, is serving a 45-year sentence on charges of
conspiracy and mail fraud for overselling lifetime partnerships to
the now-bankrupt PTL ministry at Heritage USA near Fort Mill, S.C.

   After a three-day rally, the dollar slipped sharply
against the yen in Tokyo today, while share prices fell again on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 129.10 yen, down 1.60 yen from Thursday's
close of 130.70 yen.
   After opening at 129.65 yen, it ranged from 128.97 yen to 129.65
yen in active trading that totaled $13.87 billion in spot
transactions.
   Dealers saw the dollar's fall as part of a series of adjustments
to a long plunge that began in the summer. The dollar closed at a
two-year low of 124.40 yen on Oct. 18. Then earlier this week it
increased by 3.35 yen during a three-day rally, ending at 130.70
yen Thursday.
   ``There had been too much dollar buying,'' said Shigeto Yanase,
a dealer at The Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank.
   Brokers said concerns over the faltering American economy were
resurfacing, with many market players waiting for the release of
U.S. government unemployment figures later today.
   The stronger yen did not help boost sentiments on the Tokyo
stock market, traders said.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed at 24,194.99 points,
down 100.17 points or 0.41 percent from Thursday's close. The
Nikkei average has now fallen 1,134.32 points in four days.
   Volume in the first section was estimated at a thin 320 million
shares, below Thursday's 350 million.
   Investors were cautious before Sunday's parliamentary
byelection, which has raised doubts about Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu's leadership, said a dealer at Daiwa Securities Co.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 84.90 points as of 5 p.m. from
84.30 points at Thursday's close. Their yield fell to 7.725 percent
from 7.860 percent.

<HEAD>Alzheimer's Disease Rises Sharply; More Awareness May Explain
Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health researchers tracking a dramatic
rise in reported deaths from Alzheimer's disease say more awareness
of the malady, rather than a sharp rise in its incidence, is the
main reason.
   ``It's a little difficult to believe that the number of people
with Alzheimer disease could increase 950 percent in eight years,''
said Dr. Richard Sun, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``Our general feeling is heightened awareness was a little more
important'' Sun said Thursday.
   The CDC said in its weekly report that 11,311 people, or 4.2 per
100,000 population, died from Alzheimer's disease in 1987. In 1979,
the first year of a CDC study, 857 deaths, or 0.4 per 100,000, were
attributed to the disease.
   For the entire 1979-87 period, Alzheimer's disease was listed as
the underlying cause of death for 46,202 people in the United
States.
   Alzheimer's disease tends to strike older people, and because
the U.S. population is aging it is likely that incidence of the
disease also is up - though not as much as the death rate increase,
Sun said.
   He said there currently is no definitive study of how many
people have Alzheimer's.
   The disease, characterized by progressive mental deterioration,
first was recognized in the early 1900s. But public awareness of
the disease was fairly limited until the 1970s.
   Doctors then, Sun said, ``realized that Alzheimer disease was a
specific disease ... and not a normal process of aging. There was
something different about people with Alzheimer disease.''
   The disease has gotten much media attention in the last 10
years, with television devoting prime time programs to it and
national magazines featuring Alzheimer's on cover stories. Federal
funding for research on Alzheimer's and related disorders rose from
$3.9 million in 1976 to $53.9 million in 1986, the Atlanta-based
CDC reported.
   Sun said that in recent years, doctors in some cases may have
changed a diagnosis from senility to Alzheimer's as they began
paying more attention to the latter.
   Sun said the death rate patterns reported by the CDC are
consistent with those documented in England, Norway, Australia and
Canada.
   The increase in the death rates for Alzheimer's disease came at
the same time that rates for other leading causes of death - such
as heart ailments, stroke, liver diseases and hardening of the
arteries - were going down, he said.
   In a separate report, the CDC said Thursday that seven chronic
diseases accounted for 79.5 percent of all deaths among the
elderly. Chief among them was heart disease, followed by malignant
tumors, cerebrovascular disease, lung disease, diabetes,
atherosclerosis and kidney disease. The study was based on 1987
Medicare data.

<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar,
convicted of obstructing justice by leaking a wiretap and lying to
the FBI, was sentenced to six months in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle said Thursday that Aguilar's
crimes warranted a term of up to 27 months, but he levied the
lighter penalty because of Aguilar's likely impeachment.
   ``These proceedings will be long and humiliating and
embarrassing and burdensome, a major and substantial punishment,''
said Bechtle, a Philadelphia judge assigned to the case by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist.
   Aguilar, the third federal judge in U.S. history sentenced to
prison for felonies committed while on the bench, faced a possible
10-year prison term and $500,000 in fines. Prosecutors sought a
minimum three-year term.
   The sentence includes fines and assessments of $2,100, and 1,000
hours of community service during two years of supervised release
after imprisonment. Aguilar remains free without bail during his
appeal, which defense lawyer Paul Meltzer said would take two
years. Unless impeached - the only way a federal judge can be
removed involuntarily - he will keep his title and salary. He is
not hearing cases but is available for settlement conferences.
   Aguilar, 59, of San Jose, was appointed to the court in 1980 by
President Carter.
   He declined to comment during or after the hearing, but was
smiling broadly when he walked up to Meltzer in a hallway and
thanked him.
   It was ``a lighter sentence than we anticipated,'' said Jess
Aguilar, one of the judge's brothers.
   Another defendant, former Teamster leader Rudy Tham, was
sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $20,000 Thursday for
conspiring to seek illicit aid from Aguilar in overturning his
embezzlement conviction.
   In a separate trial, Aguilar was acquitted of conspiracy in the
Tham case. A jury convicted Aguilar in August of two felony charges
for disclosing a wiretap in February 1988 to reputed mobster Abe
Chapman and lying in April 1988 to FBI agents who questioned him
about the wiretap and his involvement in Tham's case.
   A fellow judge had told Aguilar in August 1987 that he had been
seen with Chapman, whose name had come up in a wiretap application.
Aguilar's nephew testified that Aguilar told him to tell Chapman
not to call him, and mentioned a wiretap. Aguilar testified that he
was only trying to warn Chapman to stay away from him.
   When FBI agents questioned Aguilar two months later, he told
them he knew nothing of a wiretap on Chapman and would not have
told Chapman if he had known.
   Aguilar was never accused of seeking personal gain, unlike the
two other federal judges imprisoned in the last decade: Harry
Claiborne of Nevada, convicted of tax evasion in 1984, and Walter
Nixon of Mississippi, convicted of perjury in 1986.
   Prosecutors instead portrayed Aguilar as a judge who wanted to
impress his friends with his influence, and lost his sense of
limits.

<HEAD>Health Proposals Embraced, But Not Implemented, by State Agencies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State health departments have embraced in
principle a set of proposals issued two years ago for improving
public medical care, but the agencies have been slow to adopt the
recommendations.
   Federal health officials aren't sure why, but say it may be
because of a shortage of funds.
   The Institute of Medicine, which advises the federal government
on public health issues, made 66 recommendations in 1988. In 1989
the state officials were surveyed by the Association of State and
Territorial Health Officials on 25 of the proposals.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported the results of the
survey Thursday.
   Among the findings:
   - Forty-eight of 50 state health departments agreed they should
``link with mental health services to improve the integration of
service delivery.'' Only 13 had done so. Eighteen more said they
planned to.
   - All 50 state agencies agreed the public should be better
educated on community health needs and policy issues. Only 34 had a
program to achieve that goal.
   - Forty-five agreed state health departments should develop
comprehensive strategies to influence health-related behavior. Just
21 had implemented a plan.
   - In some areas, there was consistency between agreement and
implementation. For instance, 49 state departments agreed that food
protection is a job for the agencies and 48 had such programs in
place.
   The survey did not get into why the recommendations were not
implemented, CDC epidemiologist Dr. Arthur Liang said. But he said
it was clear from the level of agreement noted in the survey that
it's not because of any lack of awareness or knowledge by state
officials.
   ``I think for some of these new areas, new for public health
perhaps, there hasn't been a consensus between the policy makers
and the taxpayers,'' he said.

   A moderate earthquake today jolted a
remote mountainous area on the island of New Guinea, but no
casualties or damage were reported, the Meteorology and Geophysics
agency said.
   The quake, measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale, hit Indonesia's
western side of the island at 12:38 p.m. (10 p.m. EST Thursday),
the agency said.
   It was centered in the Baliem valley, 35 miles east of Wamena.
The eastern end of the island belongs to the nation of Papua New
Guinea.
   Wamena, capital of the mountainous region of Jaya Wijaya, is
about 2,200 miles east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
   The agency said the quake also was felt in the Irian Jaya
provincial capital of Jayapura, about 170 miles northeast of
Wamena.
   In August last year 106 were killed in Kurima mountainous
district just east of the area by an earthquake measuring 6 on the
Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas.

   President Bush says a look at history will
back up his suggestion that Saddam Hussein is a barbarian
surpassing Adolf Hitler, but experts on the Nazi era disagree with
him.
   ``We don't see the kind of atrocities being committed in Kuwait
and Iraq that would match those of Nazi Germany,'' said Richard
Breitman, a professor of history at American University and a
specialist in the Hitler era.
   ``No one yet, and I hope no one ever will, match up to the
systematized brutalities and racist policies that Adolf Hitler
committed,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate director of the
Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.
   The center is devoted to the study of the Nazi Holocaust, in
which an estimated 6 million Jews were killed, and its contemporary
implications.
   Bush, speaking at a Republican rally in Mashpee, Mass.,
Thursday, said Saddam's Iraqi invaders ``have committed outrageous
acts of barbarism. Brutality - I don't believe that Adolf Hitler
ever participated in anything of that nature.''
   Later, at a news conference in Orlando, Fla., Bush said, ``I
don't think I am overstating it. I know I am not overstating the
feelings I have about it. ... I think the American people are as
outraged as I am about the treatment of the people in our embassy,
for example, and I think it is important that they know my concerns
on this subject.''
   ``I was told that Hitler did not stake people out against
military targets,'' the president said. ``He did respect the
legitimacy of the embassies, so there are some differences.''
   He added, ``I see many similarities between the Iraqi behavior
in Kuwait and the way the Death's Head regiments behaved in Poland.
Go back and take a look at the history and you can see why I'm as
concerned as I am.'' ''
   The Death's Head units were notorious blackshirted SS troops
that began as Hitler's personal bodyguard. They were blamed for
many atrocities during the German invasion of Poland.
   Breitman said many of the specific points Bush made were correct
and could make Saddam appear worse than Hitler in some respects,
``but I don't think the overall record would show that to be the
case.''
   He said that at the outbreak of World War II the Nazis interned
foreign diplomats in conditions ``that were not comfortable, but
were nothing like what we are seeing in Kuwait and Iraq.''
   These diplomats were eventually exchanged for German diplomats
in Allied custody, Breitman said.
   He said he was not aware that the Nazis ever took hostages to
potential military targets to use them as human shields as Saddam
has done.
   Cooper, however, said Bush was ``absolutely wrong'' on the
point.
   ``Look at the millions of people of all nationalities who were
forced into slave labor factories in Germany and many of them got
blown away by the Allied bombing missions,'' he said.
   Breitman said Hitler is not known to have visited any of the
Nazi death camps, but ``that does not mean he was not involved.''
   He also said the activities of the Death's Head units were
``only the tip of the iceberg in terms of brutality in Poland'' by
the German invaders.
   The historian said he was not defending Saddam. He said the
Iraqi leader has committed crimes ``that give the idea of a
Nuremberg-type trial a certain legitimacy to raise.''
Administration sources have said that such a trial, along the lines
of the war crimes trials held in Nuremberg, Germany, after World
War II, is a possibility.
   At the Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Cooper said, ``Saddam Hussein
has a list of crimes that I don't think has to be compared with
anybody in order for the people of America to understand how
serious a threat he represents.''
   ``But let's also keep this thing in some sort of perspective,''
he said. ``And to say that he outstrips Adolf Hitler, I just think
it's either a slip of the tongue or a speech writer got carried
away.''
   Other Jewish leaders generally agreed.
   David Harris, executive vice president of the American Jewish
Committee, said, ``Both men, each in his own way, represents an
incarnation of evil. But to try and suggest that Saddam Hussein is
a man of even greater evil than Adolf Hitler to me doesn't add to
the discussion.''
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, called Bush's remark ``an unfortunate exaggeration
that could hurt the president's credibility at a time when it is
very important that he remain credible.''
   ``Saddam Hussein is writing his own chapter of barbarism,''
Foxman said. ``It's the Saddam Hussein chapter and one need not
compare or exaggerate.''

   Two bombs blamed on leftist radicals blew up in a
police dormitory, killing an officer and injuring six other people.
The blasts and other incidents today cast doubt on security efforts
for Emperor Akihito's coronation 10 days away.
   Three unexploded bombs were found and a firebomb was hurled at a
police station today, after the blasts at the dormitory early this
morning and late Thursday night.
   The violence occurred as 26,000 police officers were mounting a
massive security operation for the Tuesday coronation.
Representatives from more than 150 countries are to attend,
including Vice President Dan Quayle and Britain's Prince Charles.
   Although scores of strategically located buildings or those
related to the imperial household, city utilities and other likely
targets have been singled out for special attention under the
security operation, police dormitories were not included in the
list.
   ``I feel a very strong anger at the violent outrage of the
ultra-leftist groups,'' Tachio Ohori, head of the Metropolitan
Police Department, told Japanese reporters in a hastily arranged,
predawn news conference called after he inspected the blast site.
   ``With all the strength of the department we hope to
successfully carry out security for the upcoming coronation,'' he
was quoted as saying in several major newspapers.
   No group claimed responsibility as of this evening. Japanese
radical groups generally take several days to issue such
statements.
   Officer Hiroshi Aoki, 48, died almost immediately after the
first blast at 11 p.m. Thursday at the dormitory in a Tokyo
district known for its numerous nightspots. The second bomb went
off about five minutes later. Officials said earlier that the bombs
exploded two hours apart.
   A Metropolitan Police Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the injured included four other
officers, the dorm's cook and another civilian.
   The official said the type of explosives and other details of
the blasts, separated by about two hours, were under investigation.
Both bombs had been placed near a garbage collection area inside
the dormitory complex, officials said.
   Along with the dormitory blasts, police reported finding two
more bombs near another police dormitory about an hour after the
first blasts, and at a public restroom elsewhere in the capital
early today.
   In central Japan, a Molotov cocktail was lobbed at a police
station before dawn. No injuries were reported.
   Leftist radicals, including the 5,000-member Chukaku-ha, or
Middle Core Faction, have repeatedly vowed to use violence to
``destroy'' the coronation and other related ceremonies. They
consider the emperor a symbol of Japan's militarist past and oppose
state funding of the enthronement.
   Last month police announced they would increase the security
deployment to 32,000 by busing in reinforcements for the coronation
day. On Wednesday it was revealed that they are considering a
further increase of thousands more.
   ``We have not made a final decision, but an increase is being
considered because of the increasing difficulty of the situation,''
a National Police Agency official said.
   Metropolitan Police Department officials today also refused to
comment on whether the thousands will be added.
   Leftist radicals have been particularly active in anti-imperial
activities since the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in February last
year.
   Although police mobilized 32,000 officers in Tokyo to guard that
ceremony, the Chukaku-ha set off a bomb along the funeral
procession route. The bomb exploded before the procession arrived,
and no one was injured.
   Over the past month, police have announced uncovering alleged
plots by the Chukaku-ha to jam television broadcasts of the
coronation and fire rockets at a tunnel along a train route the
emperor is to travel later this month.
   The radical group is believed to have mortar-style weapons with
a range of 4 miles.

<TEXT>
   J. Spencer Kinard, for 18 years the
announcer for a CBS radio program featuring the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir, has resigned in a flap over his relationship with a local
television newswoman.
   Kinard, 50, also quit his job as vice president for news and
public affairs at KSL television, station vice president Bill
Murdoch announced Thursday.
   The station, owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, also employs Jennifer Howe, 24, as a news anchorwoman.
   KSL staffers criticized Kinard and Howe after they were seen
together on several occasions. Both maintained their relationship
was professional, not romantic.
   Since 1972 Kinard has been announcer for the weekly ``Music and
the Spoken Word'' radio program featuring the church's famous
choir. The Sunday program, which debuted in 1929, is the CBS Radio
Network's longest-running show.
   Kinard also has been an executive with KSL for 18 years.
   ``I am convinced that the events over the past few weeks have
made it impossible for me to be effective in that position,'' he
said in a written resignation Wednesday.
   He could not be reached for further comment. His son, David,
said Thursday night Kinard was not taking phone calls.
   Kinard had been on medical leave from both jobs since Oct. 19.
   Howe, whom the station placed on two weeks' paid leave last
week, said she hadn't heard about Kinard's resignation.
   Howe's husband filed for divorce the day after she and Kinard
were seen on a Sept. 30 flight from Oakland, Calif., to Salt Lake
City. Kinard and Howe said that was a chance meeting.

<HEAD>Republic Begins Issuing Rationing Coupons, Confusion Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ukrainian government today began issuing
rationing cards in what was seen as an effort to prevent hoarding
and to keep scarce products from being sold outside the republic.
   Some Ukrainian nationalists saw the move as a prelude to issuing
a currency in the southwestern republic, whose parliament declared
sovereignty in July.
   The immediate result, however, was confusion and long lines of
angry shopers in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, media reports said.
   Each worker, student and pensioner receives coupons equivalent
to 70 percent of their monthly income along with the cash, under
the system decreed by the Ukrainian Council of Ministers last
Friday.
   The coupons, good for six months and marked with cash values
similar to ruble notes, must be presented along with rubles to
purchase basic goods, such as food, gasoline, cigarettes and
liquor.
   ``Only slightly more than half of Kiev's residents have been
given coupons,'' the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said in a
report from the Ukrainian capital. ``Others were not so lucky.''
   The newspaper said that most people were caught unaware by the
new measures, announced last Friday on radio and television.
``During the day, many streets of the capital were blocked by
groups of angry people,'' it said.
   Chris Kedzie, an American economic researcher living in Kiev,
said, ``it is a very confusing and difficult situation. People were
caught by surprise.''
   He said there were no specific instuctions issued on how to use
the coupons and state stores were closed three times during the
week as managers prepared for the new system.
   Kedzie said the primary goal of the coupons, according to
economists he interviewed, was to keep Ukrainian goods inside the
republic and feed their own people during the winter.
   ``This is a stopgap measure. There are not enough food and goods
for the winter,'' he said. ``People are stocking up on
everything.''
   The independent Ukrainian Information Agency said, ``this
resolution was adopted in hurry, without proposing it for the
preliminary discussion by the population.''
   It said the coupon system will not properly provide for the
needs of families, lead to black marketeering and result in
inflated prices.
   Petro Borsuk, an official of the nationalist Ukrainian Republic
Party, said he was optimistic the coupon system would take root.
``I see it as a first step toward a (Ukrainian) national
currency,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Vladimir Pylutchuk, a member of the Supreme Soviet Economic
Reform Committee, said the coupon system could be seen in the
context of creating a Ukrainian currency, but not in the immediate
future.
   For the time being, he told Kedzie in an interview, ``it's a way
to keep goods in the republic.''
   All but one of the 15 Soviet republics have declared some form
of autonomy from Moscow. The only holdout is Kirgizia, a Central
Asian republic, and its legislature is expected to declare
sovereignty soon.

   McDonald's Corp.'s decision to switch from
polystyrene containers to paper for its food products is being
hailed by some - but not all - environmentalists.
   ``It is a mistake to make plastic the great satan and paper the
great saint,'' said Jan Beyea, a scientist at the National Audubon
Society. ``Both processes generate pollution.''
   A recycling company, meanwhile, lamented McDonald's announcement
Thursday that it would start phasing out its clamshell-shaped
containers - which had been blamed for filling landfills and
depleting the ozone layer - within two months.
   The fast-food giant had been playing a key role in educating the
public about the need to recycle, said E. James Schneiders,
president of National Polystyrene Recycling Co.
   McDonald's just last week said it planned to expand an
experimental plastic recycling program to all of its 8,500 U.S.
restaurants.
   ``NPRC is disappointed to learn that McDonald's has decided to
phase out its use of polystyrene foam packaging,'' Schneiders said.
   But the non-profit Environmental Defense Fund, which had worked
with McDonald's since August on plans to phase out the plastic foam
containers, was elated.
   ``McDonald's understands that the future is green,'' said
Frederic D. Krupp, the fund's executive director. ``I think other
companies will follow suit.''
   Several U.S. cities have banned the use of polystyrene foam,
saying it contributes to landfill problems by lingering for years
before disintegrating. The polystyrene production process also is
suspected of harming the Earth's ozone level.
   ``Although some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging
is environmentally sound, our customers just don't feel good about
it,'' McDonald's Corp. President Edward Rensi said by telephone
Thursday from the company's suburban Oak Brook headquarters. ``So
we're changing.''
   Joseph Bow, president of the Foodservice &amp; Packaging Institute
in Washington, accused McDonald's of ``bowing to public pressure
that is based on misconceptions and misinformation.''
   ``You don't want to get rid of them (polystyrene products) all
together,'' he said. ``They provide consumers with a sanitary and
timesaving method of food delivery.''
   A spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency in
Washington, Robin Woods, said her agency had no studies that
indicated foam packaging is environmentally sound. But she also
said, ``It may not be an environmental hazard because it's inert.
It's not something that breaks down easily and leeches into
landfills, for example.''
   McDonald's said the foam containers will be replaced by paper
products manufactured in a new process that will preserve the
food's temperature and freshness.
   McDonald's Vice President Shelby Yastrow said the polystyrene
containers are made for McDonald's by several companies, including
Amoco Foam Products Co., Mobil Corp., Jen-Pak and Huntsman
Chemical. Amoco Foam President John Giroux said 10 percent of his
company's polystyrene sales were to McDonald's.
   Rensi said the sandwich containers represent about 75 percent of
the company's polystyrene use. McDonald's still will use plastic
utensils and coffee cups.
   Rensi and Krupp said McDonald's and the environmental group had
formed a task force to look into phasing out polystyrene containers
last August. When Krupp heard last week that the company was having
a change of heart he quickly lobbied against it.
   ``When we learned they were planning to go to comprehensive
recycling, we reacted strongly,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Israel Fails to Protect Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinians in the occupied lands cannot
count on Israel to protect them, and the United Nations may call
for a meeting to ensure their safety under international law, the
U.N. chief says.
   Israel's U.N. mission rejected Thursday's comments by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar as interference and said
Israel has sole control of the territories.
   Perez de Cuellar's proposals came in an 11-page report ordered
by the U.N. Security Council after the Oct. 8 killings of 20 Arabs
by Israeli forces during rioting in Arab east Jerusalem. The
council has already condemned Israel for the bloodshed.
   Perez de Cuellar did not make specific recommendations on
deploying U.N. observers or peacekeepers to monitor the territories
captured from Arab neighbors in the 1967 Mideast War.
   Arabs have sought U.N. intervention.
   Palestine Liberation Organization representative Riyad Mansour
said the report was ``positive'' but fell short.
   ``We would have preferred stronger and clearer recommendations
... through recommendations by the secretary-general to the council
to dispatch a U.N. force to provide protection,'' Mansour said. He
said such a proposal would soon be made to the Security Council.
   Arab leaders have compared Israel's occupation to Iraq's control
of Kuwait. They have chastized the United Nations for its more
subdued response to Israel's occupation.
   Perez de Cuellar said the Palestinians' distrust of Israeli
authorities ``had grown so deep that they felt that only an
impartial presence, properly mandated by the United Nations, would
be able to provide them with a credible sense of protection.''
   He did not support or reject that suggestion, however.
   ``The tragic events of Oct. 8, 1990, are only the most recent of
many grave incidents in the occupied territories that have resulted
in the deaths and wounding of a large number of civilians,'' Perez
de Cuellar said.
   Israeli forces intervened in riots in Jerusalem on that day
after Arabs started throwing stones at praying Jews.
   Perez de Cuellar said that despite the need for protection of
Palestinians, the essential, underlying problem ``is a political
conflict that lies at the heart of the tragic events.''
   ``For any measure or protection to be ensured, the cooperation
of the Israeli authorities is, under present circumstances,
absolutely essential,'' he said.
   The Security Council had proposed sending an investigating team
to Israel, but Israeli authorities said they would bar any U.N.
envoys from carrying out such a mission.
   The secretary-general said Thursday that the Security Council
might wish to call for a meeting of the 164 nations that signed the
1949 Fourth Geneva Convention on protection of civilians in
wartime.
   He indicated such a gathering could consider how protective
measures should be imposed and whether a ``protecting power''
should be designated in the occupied territories.
   The convention, which Israel signed, prohibits mistreatment of
civilians, deportations, collective punishment or destruction of
property.
   Diplomats said they could not recall a prior meeting of the 164
signatories to reassess the convention and decide how it should be
applied to new situations.
   Yuval Rotem, a spokesman for Israel's U.N. mission, said his
country's ``responsibility (under the Geneva accord) is not subject
to review or intervention by other authorities.''
   He said the status of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip ``is
not clear under international law and the Geneva Convention
regarding occupied territory does not legally apply.''
   However, Rotem said Israel had decided to act in accordance with
the convention's humanitarian provisions.
   ``Under established rules of international law,'' he said,
``Israel has the sole responsibility for the administration of
these areas, including the duty to maintain law and order.''
   At least 765 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the nearly 3-year-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule of
the occupied lands. At least 290 Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Arabs, most as suspected collaborators. More than 50
Israelis also have died.

   A Massachusetts gravel plant foreman who saved
a co-worker from grinding machinery and two Canadian women who
confronted a knife-wielding intruder after he slashed their elderly
neighbor were among 18 people recognized by the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission.
   The annual awards honor people who risked their lives in efforts
to save others. Three of those named Thursday died in their
attempts.
   The commision founded by Pittsburgh industrialist Andrew
Carnegie in 1904 has recognized 7,495 Americans and Canadians over
the years. More than $18.8 million has been awarded. Winners, or
their survivors, get $2,500.
   Twenty-four-year-old Michael Radwich of Hinsdale, Mass., said he
had little time to think when co-worker Scott Pierce became
entangled in a gravel sorter he was repairing on Oct. 18, 1989.
   ``He was leaning in to see how it was working,'' Radwich said.
``I could see him getting wrapped up in the shaft, getting dragged
up.''
   ``I grabbed for him and yanked him out. He fell back on the deck
and I could see his arm was almost off,'' he said.
   Pierce's left arm and Radwich's left thumb were nearly severed
and had to be reattached.
   Also honored were Grace Nolan, 50, of Whitby, Ontario, and Irene
Beaton, 67, of Lindsay, Ontario, who challenged a man who broke
into the home of a neighbor, Dorothy Blackhall, 72, and slashed her
face.
   Mrs. Blackhall survived and the attacker was placed in a mental
institution, Mrs. Nolan said.
   Kenneth L. Yant, Jr., 33, of Plainfield, Ind., was among those
who died as a result of their heroics. Yant died Aug. 26, 1989
while trying to rescue an 11-year-old boy from drowning in
Martinsville, Ind.
   Another award winner who died was John E. Dedon, 42, of Jackson,
La., who died trying to save an 8-year-old boy from drowning Aug.
6, 1989. The third was David A. Guillen, 32, was fatally shot Dec.
1, 1989 when he intervened on behalf of a 13-year-old boy being
robbed of his bike in Bell, Calif.
   Other winners were:
   -Daniel D. Sanders, 30, of Washington, Pa., who jumped into a
creek and saved a fisherman from drowning Oct. 18, 1989, in Burt,
N.Y.
   -Curtis C. Dennison, 35, of Irwin, Pa., who carried a woman from
a car moments before leaking gas ignited, engulfing the car in
flames on Oct. 28, 1989, in Lewisville, Ohio.
   -Gerald Heinen, 48, of Loves Park, Ill., who tried to save a
79-year-old woman from a burning car in Ridott, Ill., on Aug. 29,
1989. The off-duty firefighter crawled through the woman's car
window and pulled her out. She later died.
   -John Joseph Theriault, 29, and Pierre O. Theriault, 35, who
rescued a teen-age girl dangling from a tree near the top of a
130-foot cliff in Bathurst, New Brunswick, on March 30, 1989.
   -Don W. Rocap, 67, of Lubbock, Texas, who saved two men from a
burning car after a crash in Lubbock on Oct. 10, 1989.
   -LeRoy Aden, 47, a gas station attendant from Fletcher, N.C.,
who rescued a state trooper struggling with a driver who pulled a
gun in Skyland, N.C., on Feb. 11. Aden grabbed the driver's gun
hand and pulled him off the officer.
   -Lawrence Ogletree, 38, of Evans, Ga., who saved a 2-year-old
boy in a runaway car in Martinez, Ga., on Aug. 8, 1989.
   -Ricky D. Bailey, 31, of Zachary, La., who nearly drowned in the
same rescue that left Dedon dead. Charles Saucier, 21, of Lake
City, Fla., who also nearly drowned in that rescue.
   -Robert L. Mathews, 32, of Warren, Ohio, who entered a burning
house in Warren three times to rescue a 3-year-old boy from his
bedroom Nov. 17, 1989.
   -Michael J. Smith, 31, of St. Thomas, Ontario, who saved a
10-year-old boy from drowning in Lake Erie on Port Burwell,
Ontario, on Aug. 4, 1989.

<HEAD>Former East German Leader Erich Honecker Says He Was Right</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker, ousted Communist leader of former
East Germany, says in a newspaper interview published today that in
the long run ``I will be seen to have been right.''
   The weekly newspaper The European quoted him as saying that his
former countrymen and women, now in a united Germany since Oct. 3,
are becoming aware of the rights and social services they have
lost.
   He also predicted communism will return to Eastern Europe,
reversing the revolution that swept East Germany and the rest of
the region last year.
   Honecker, 78, was head of state in the former East Germany from
1976 until he was toppled Oct. 18 last year. He was arrested on
charges of treason last January.
   The paper, printed by London-based publisher Robert Maxwell and
circulated throughout Europe, said he was interviewed in a small
apartment within a Soviet military hospital compound outside
Berlin.
   It said the interview was conducted by Heinz Judge, a comrade of
Honecker in the anti-Nazi resistance.
   The paper said Honecker expressed no fear in the interview of
facing criminal charges.
   ``I am not afraid of a show trial. I consider all the charges so
far brought by the prosecutor's office untenable,'' Honecker was
quoted as saying.
   ``I also reject responsibility for the figure, cited by the
prosecutor's office, of 200 killed on the GDR (German Democratic
Republic - East Germany) borders. I have no personal guilt for
that. And what, I ask myself, about those who killed GDR border
guards while violating our frontiers?''
   The paper quoted him as saying it had been ``a great
disappointment for me that so many people have forgotten socialism
and turned to the D-mark instead.
   ``But I am not afraid that former GDR citizens would threaten me
or lynch me, despite the demonstration cries and banner slogans of
the so-called `democrats.' Quite the contrary; in the end I will be
seen to have been right,'' he said.
   ``It has already become quite obvious to all what rights and
social services they have lost,'' Honecker said.
   He contended that the communist parties of the old East bloc had
been brought down by intrigues but that they could bounce back.
   ``What is needed now,'' Honecker was quoted as saying, ``is a
merciless investigation of the reasons for what has happened and
the relevant conclusions to be drawn. The communist movement has
certainly suffered a defeat but it will recover.''
   He offered no apologies for his years in power.
   ``Everything I did, I did in the knowledge that I was doing
something for the people and for peace. In the present situation
they need scapegoats and I am being made the biggest one,'' he
said.
   ``My wife and I are shocked by the allegations and calumnies
against us. We are accused of corruption and self-enrichment at the
expense of the people,'' Honecker said. ``But Margot and I have
nothing to reproach ourselves with. We did not lead a life of
luxury and we do not have a bank account in Switzerland.''

   A Florida radio station promotion will
award a ``Gulf Coast Breeders Cup'' and $1,000 to the first of
three couples to conceive a child in a novel contest designed to
lure baby-boomers.
   ``We thought, `Why do another car giveaway?''' WTKX Program
Director Mike Ondayko said Wednesday. ``This is the type of
promotion that gets the audience excited about something.''
   The three couples will be selected from contestants who submit
50-word essays explaining why they can beat other couples in a
``race to conception.''
   The station will give the finalists what it calls ``love
enhancers:'' a water bed, a night in a hotel, a seafood buffet, a
gift certificate from a lingerie shop, champagne, candles and green
M&amp;Ms.
   Female contestants must submit to a pregnancy test at the onset
of the competition to make sure they are not already pregnant.
   To determine the winner, the station will pay for a weekly
pregnancy test. Contest rules prohibit artificial insemination and
in-vitro fertilization.
   The contest is aimed at boosting the station's popularity among
listeners in the 25-44 age group.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI will review reports that terrorists
exploited an undercover drug operation to bomb Pan Am Flight 103
but there is nothing thus far to support them, the Justice
Department says.
   Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr said Thursday in a
statement that ``at this time we know of no evidence giving
credence to these allegations'' but it was important ``to determine
their credibility as soon as possible.''
   The department said the FBI will review reports by NBC-TV and
ABC-TV that terrorists penetrated a Drug Enforcement Administration
operation to put explosives aboard the 1988 flight that ended in a
bomb explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   In Germany, an official also said investigators would examine
the reports but added that an earlier inquiry had failed to
substantiate them.
   Frankfurt City Prosecutor Hubert Harth said investigators there
had examined the charges a year ago. He said the information then
pertained not to the DEA but to a drug-tracing operation of the
Central Intelligence Agency.
   ``There was absolutely no confirmation in this direction,''
Harth said. ``Nonetheless, we will once more examine these new
reports.''
   The networks reported Tuesday that terrorists might have
substituted baggage containing bombs for suitcases loaded with
heroin that DEA had placed on U.S.-bound planes to track the routes
of Lebanese drug traffickers.
   FBI Director William Sessions, speaking to reporters in Glasgow,
Scotland, refused to comment on the network reports.
   Sessions expressed confidence that the bombers would be brought
to justice but indicated that the investigation could take
additional years.
   ``We will not let go. We are not only tenacious, but we are
diligent about our responsibility,'' said Sessions.
   The FBI investigated similar reports a year ago and found no
basis for them, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   DEA spokesman Bill Ruzzamenti said there was ``absolutely no
evidence whatsoever in anything we have done preliminarily to
substantiate any claims about any involvement by DEA in any way
with Pan Am 103.''
   NBC reported that terrorists may have discovered an arrangement
between DEA and German security officials that allowed them to
substitute explosives-filled suitcases for luggage that contained
heroin.
   The bombing killed 259 people aboard the U.S.-bound flight and
11 more on the ground.
   The New York-bound flight originated in Frankfurt and stopped in
London, where passengers and luggage were transferred to a larger
airplane.

<HEAD>Government Eases Return for Exiles; Five Dead In Factional
Fighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Special travel documents
allowing political exiles entrance to South Africa will be issued
to speed their return, Home Affairs Minister Gene Louw announced
today.
   Louw spoke a day after the government said it was ready to begin
releasing political prisoners and allow the large-scale return of
exiles in accordance with an earlier agreement with the African
National Congress.
   The actions indicate the government wants constitutional
negotiations with the ANC and other opposition groups to proceed as
quickly as possible.
   Also today, the independent South African Press Association
reported that parents at an elite Afrikaner school near Cape Town
have voted to accept students of all races, making it thefirst of
its kind to open its doors to blacks.
   The parents of Groote Schuur Laerskool voted overwhelmingly to
remain a government-funded school with autonomy over admissions
requirements, the news agency said.
   Elsewhere in South Africa, more black factional fighting
Thursday night left at least five people dead, officials said.
   Release of political prisoners and the return of thousands of
exiles have been key ANC demands in peace talks with the government
designed to set up full-scale negotiations.
   In August, the government agreed in principle to the demands,
but implementation was delayed by disputes in the talks with the
ANC.
   Membership in the ANC and other anti-government organizations
was a crime in South Africa until February, when President F.W. de
Klerk legalized 60 opposition groups and movements. Thousands of
people had fled the country to avoid arrest.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee on Thursday released the first
report of a government-ANC working group on the prisoner and exile
issues. The report set guidelines for ANC exiles, prisoners and
fugitives to apply for indemnity from prosecution for acts
committed during the group's 30-year guerrilla war against the
white-led government.
   The ANC suspended its largely dormant armed struggle in August
to meet government demands.
   Coetsee said the government ``could now proceed in a phased
manner'' with the agreement to release political prisoners and
bring back exiles. He said the rate of implementation would depend
on the ANC's adherence to its promise to end all violence.
   The ANC has said it has 20,000 exiles and estimates there are
about 1,500 political prisoners. The government has not given
figures for either category.
   Exiles seeking to return will fill out applications stating
their past acts, but Coetsee said the information could not be used
against them in a court of law.
   A special committee will be set up to review applications, and
the Justice Ministry also will consider some applications. Coetsee

   Fighting between mine workers of different tribes erupted at a
coal mine in Natal Province, injuring 11 people, and five people
died in other violence, officials said today.
   The mine clash between Zulus and Xhosas occurred Thursday night
at the Kilbarchan coal mine near Newcastle, about 150 miles
southeast of Johannesburg, said Genmin, which operates the mine.
   Also in Natal, two people were killed and seven wounded when a
group of unidentified assailants opened fire with automatic weapons
Thursday night on three houses in Stanger, police said.
   Two more people died in separate Natal shootings, and a body
with stab wounds was found in the Tembisa black township near
Johannesburg, police said.
   Factional fighting pitting Zulus loyal to the conservative
Inkatha Freedom Party against Xhosas and other blacks linked to the
ANC has killed about 800 people in townships near Johannesburg
since August. The unrest spread from Natal Province, where five
years of warfare has killed 5,000 people.

   The dollar continued to fall against the yen in
European trading this morning and was broadly lower against other
key currencies. Gold was steady.
   In Tokyo, the dollar's three-day rally against the yen ended
abruptly. It closed at 129.10 yen, down 1.60 yen from Thursday's
close. Later in London, it was quoted at 128.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   -1.5010 German marks, down from 1.5070
   -1.2701 Swiss francs, down from 1.2745
   -5.0380 French francs, down from 5.0525

   Dealers in Tokyo saw the dollar's fall as part of a series of
adjustments to a long plunge that began in the summer. The dollar
closed at a two-year low of 124.40 yen on Oct. 18. Then, earlier
this week, it increased by 3.35 yen during a three-day rally,

   Attorney General Steve Clark was spared
jail time after his conviction for using his state credit card to
boost his brief run for governor and sagging personal finances.
   Clark was fined $10,000 Thursday after the jury convicted him of
felony theft by deception.
   ``I think it's important that Steve Clark as attorney general
was treated like any other person in the system,'' Prosecutor Chris
Piazza said after the verdict was announced.
   ``Obviously, I'm very disappointed,'' said Clark, 43. ``As I've
said all along, it was never my intention to defraud or deceive.''
   Defense attorney Bill Bristow said an appeal was likely.
   Jurors convicted Clark of a less severe crime than the one
prosecutors filed against him, deciding the theft amounted to less
than $2,500 but more than $200. Clark, who is paid $26,500 a year
as attorney general, had been charged with stealing more than
$2,500.
   Clark said he would make a decision whether to resign his office
within 24 hours. Bristow scheduled an afternoon news conference to
answer questions about Clark's future.
   Todd McCall, spokesman for the attorney general's office, said
the state constitution requires Clark to resign because of his
felony conviction.
   McCall would not comment on whether Clark could remain in office
if he appeals the verdict.
   Jurors deliberated for just over four hours before arriving at
the verdict. Circuit Judge Perry V. Whitmore followed the jury's
sentencing recommendation by fining Clark and sparing him jail
time.
   ``I didn't want to see the man go to prison,'' said juror Brenda
Beall, 27, of North Little Rock. ``My God, he has suffered enough,
but we didn't want him to get away with taking our money - your
money, my money.''
   Piazza argued successfully that Clark used a state Visa card to
prop up his gubernatorial campaign and failing personal finances.
   Before discrepancies in his expense records were exposed in the
Arkansas Gazette, Clark announced he would seek the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination. He dropped out of the race a few weeks
later, after dozens of people told reporters they didn't attend
dinner parties where Clark reported them as guests, or said the
meals were strictly social affairs.
   Piazza said Clark used the credit card to help raise campaign
contributions that ended up in his personal checking account. Five
women friends of Clark testified they shared meals with him that
were charged to the state.

<TEXT>
   American authorities have imposed
travel restrictions at U.S. military bases here as Manila and
Washington prepare to resume talks on the future of the facilities,
a spokesman said today.
   The Air Force spokesman, Maj. Wayne Crist, said the restrictions
took effect Wednesday at Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila.
   He said there will be a 9:00 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. curfew and base
personnel will not be allowed to leave the facility except on
official business.
   Liberty also will be curtailed for service members at the Subic
Bay Naval Base and the San Miguel naval communications facility
west of Manila starting tonight, a U.S. Navy spokesman said.
   The spokesman said only personnel living outside the facility
will be allowed to leave the base, but their movement will be
limited to travel directly between their homes and their offices.
   Clark is located in Pampanga province where Communist insurgents
are active. Communist rebels killed two American servicemen near
Clark on the eve of exploratory talks in May.
   U.S. officials said American and Philippine military reports
have indicated that the threat against Department of Defense
personnel and their families at the facilities ``has significantly
increased.'' They did not elaborate.
   Travel restrictions were also imposed in September, during the
first round of talks on a new bases treaty. There were no attacks
against U.S. service members then.
   President Corazon Aquino said the negotiations will resume
before she leaves Nov. 11 for Japan to attend coronation ceremonies
for Emperor Akihito.
   The U.S. maintains Clark, Subic and four smaller facilities
under an agreement that expires in September 1991. The Philippine
Constitution requires a treaty approved by the Senate to keep the
facilities beyond 1991.
   There are about 40,000 U.S. troops, Defense Department employees
and dependents at the U.S. facilities in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   Police fatally shot at least 10 Hindu
fundamentalists today, repulsing a renewed assault on a Moslem
mosque in a religious dispute that has left more than 250 people
dead nationwide.
   More than 60 people and three police officers were injured in
the clash.
   The conflict has spilled into Moslem Bangladesh, where two more
people died today from anti-Hindu rioting. Pakistan's caretaker
prime minister said India is not doing enough to protect Moslem
shrines.
   About 10,000 Hindus tried to storm the hilltop Babri Mosque,
which they want to replace with a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, 300
miles southeast of New Delhi. The conflict in the northeastern town
threatens to bring down the government of Prime Minister V.P.
Singh.
   Police used tear gas and pushed back the crowds with blows from
6-foot-long bamboo staves. Reporters saw scores of people injured
before the crowd retreated down dirt alleys and into buildings.
   Police opened fire after coming under a repeated barrage of
stones from the roofs of buildings. Witnesses saw police chasing
the militants onto the roofs and firing on the crowds in the narrow
lanes below.
   Reporters counted 10 bodies in the streets and in a hospital.
Witnesses claimed more people were killed, and Hindu militants
refused to let them take away the corpses.
   Doctors at Faizabad Hospital said they treated 64 people for
injuries, including 48 hit by gunfire. Six of those injured were in
critical condition. Three injured policemen were also brought to
the hospital.
   One of the injured Hindus, Bhupendra Singh Rawat, 24, accused
the police of shooting needlessly.
   ``Two policemen dragged a man out of the house and shot him in
the chest. Then they also shot two people who were crying over a
dead body. They were shot in the back,'' he said, speaking from a
hospital bed.
   Today was the last day of a four-day pilgrimage period declared
by astrologers and Hindu holy men as the auspicious time for
beginning construction of the temple.
   At least 257 people have been killed in an unrelenting wave of
violence in six Indian states since the fighting began Oct. 24,
according to a tally of official reports and news agency accounts.
   Singh's government vowed to defend the Moslem site until the
courts decide its fate. His stand cost him his majority in
Parliament when a Hindu party withdrew its support last week.
   He faces a no-confidence motion Nov. 7, which he appears likely
to lose. Moves were afoot to replace him as leader of the Janata
Dal Party, which might rescue the governing National Front
coalition from defeat in Parliament.
   Jockeying in the Janata Dal centered on two rural-based
politicians, Devi Lal and Chandra Shekhar, who command wide
followings among lower-class Hindus. Singh was elected last year
largely on the strength of the middle class, which grew
disenchanted with the Congress Party headed by Rajiv Gandhi.
   The Ayodhya dispute ignited religious tensions in neighboring
Bangladesh, an Islamic nation with a Hindu minority. Three people
were reported killed and more than 350 were wounded in three days
of rioting in Dhaka, the capital, and in 12 other cities.
   Doctors said two people died of bullet wounds in Dhaka early
today. One Moslem businessman died Wednesday of wounds suffered in
Dhaka.
   Hindus say the 460-year-old Babri Mosque was built on the
foundation of an early Hindu temple marking the birthplace of Rama,
the much-worshiped warrior god. Moslems dispute the history of the
site and say that relinquishing the site would jeopardize hundreds
of other Moslem sites.

   A Belgian and an American scientist
today won a Swiss foundation's prize for their cancer research.
   Thierry Boon of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in
Brussels and Ronald Levy of Stanford University in California will
split the $315,000 Steiner Prize.
   Boon was honored for inquiries into immunology that could help
lead to therapy and promote the study of organ transplants, the
foundation said.
   Levy was cited for introducing a treatment for malignant tumors
using so-called monoclonal antibodies.
   The prize, administered by the Bern-based Steiner Foundation, is
drawn from the estate of Josef Steiner, a wealthy Swiss pharmacist
who died in 1983.
   It has been awarded since 1986 and is considered one of the
world's top cancer research prizes.

   A judge today ordered a Palestinian-American
held for questioning on suspicion he carried out a fatal bus
attack. The suspect was the first to be extradited from the United
States during the Palestinian uprising.
   Mahmoud Atta, allegedly a member of the Abu Nidal terrorist
group, is accused of taking part in a 1986 machine gun attack on a
bus carrying Jewish settlers in the West Bank. The driver was
killed and a passenger wounded.
   His lawyer accused police of violating the extradition agreement
barring mistreatment by denying Atta a change of clothes and a
shower since his arrival in Israel on Wednesday.
   ``Police invited all the camera crews and then presented him
dirty and unshaven,'' defense lawyer Leah Tzemel told reporters
outside the courtroom. ``This is how you build an image of a
terrorist.''
   Atta, 37, also known as Mahmoud el-Abed Ahmed, flashed a victory
sign to dozens of photographers with a shackled hand before being
led into the courtroom of Jerusalem Magistrate Moshe Ravid.
   Ravid granted a police request that Atta be held 15 days for
questioning.
   ``I guess the Americans wouldn't have extradited him if they
didn't have some evidence against him,'' Ravid said.
   Atta, an American citizen, was arrested by U.S. authorities
three years ago. On Aug. 31, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his
final appeal of extradition, and he was brought to Israel.
   He was the first suspect extradited from the United States
during the nearly 35-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Abu Nidal group threatened to attack U.S. targets if Atta
was extradited. Following the threats, the State Department issued
an unusual warning that Abu Nidal's group was planning a revenge
attack on a passenger ship in the eastern Mediterranean.
   Ms. Tzemel said today that unidentified security agents,
including a Hebrew-speaker, originally captured Atta in Venezuela
and interrogated him for nine days before delivering him to
American authorities on June 6, 1987.
   Atta sat silently during the 90-minute hearing, listening to an
Arabic translation of the Hebrew proceedings. His feet remained
shackled.
   No indictment has been handed down against Atta, and he did not
enter a plea. He has repeatedly said he was innocent.
   It is routine in Israel for suspects to be held for police
interrogation before charges are brought.

   Nine Albanians, including two soldiers,
crossed into Greece from Albania today and sought political asylum,
the government said.
   The Albanians, all of Greek origin, were men between the ages of
19 and 27. They declared their opposition to Albania's hard-line
Communist government.
   Five other Albanians of Greek extraction fled to Greece on
Thursday.
   The announcement said the nine men made their way across the
border and through unmarked, rugged terrain in northwestern Greece.
They surrenderedto police in the village of Psarades.
   Their request for political asylum is being considered, the
government announcement added.
   Hundreds of Albanians have sought asylum in Greece in the past
two years. An undisclosed number of ethnic Greeks have been shot
and killed by Albanian border guards as they attempted to flee.
   The Orthodox Church of Greece says 400,000 Albanians of Greek
extraction live in Albania and face religious persecution. Albania
denies that, and says the number of ethnic Greeks is less than
100,000.

<TEXT>
   A Halloween attack on a group of homeless men
that left one dead and nine injured was an indication that New York
residents don't see homeless people as human beings, the city's
human rights commissioner said.
   A dozen young people, some dressed in Halloween costumes, yelled
``trick or treat'' before attacking the men with bats, pipes,
knives and meat cleavers, said Capt. Steve Davis, a police
spokesman.
   Carlos Melendez, 35, was killed when the gang slashed his
throat. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Davis said.
   ``What we are witnessing here is a dehumanization process which
is already under way,'' said Human Rights Commissioner Dennis
DeLeon. ``As New Yorkers, we must all realize that the homeless are
human beings with rights like all the rest of us which must be
recognized and enforced.''
   The attackers, aged 16 to 25, waited in a dark wooded area and
attacked the homeless men as they walked over a narrow footbridge
to the Keena Men's Shelter on Ward's Island. The footbridge links
the island with Manhattan.
   Ward's Island, in the East River beneath the Triborough Bridge,
also is home to the Fire Department training academy, several
psychiatric hospitals and a sewage disposal plant.
   Davis said that two or three of the attack victims said they had
been robbed of $15 or $20 each. But Melendez was found with $15 in
his pocket.
   The robbery-and-assault spree lasted about 35 minutes Wednesday,
ending just before a police officer arrived to close the footbridge
at 10 p.m.
   ``Everyone knew you had to get off the bridge before 10 p.m. or
you'd be stuck on the island,'' Davis said.
   Five of the injured men were treated at a hospital and released.
Three others were treated by police at a precinct house, and
another man was listed as stable at Harlem Hospital after he was
beaten about the face with a baseball bat.
   ``The motive was robbing people and assaulting them,'' Davis
said. ``I can't believe the fact it was Halloween escaped them.''
   No arrests have been made in the attack.

<TEXT>
   The prospect of a meeting called by the United
Nations to ensure the safety of Palestinians raised fears here
today about Israel's increasing isolation in the world community.
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
Thursday suggested the meeting, saying Palestinians in the occupied
lands cannot count on Israel to protect them.
   His proposals came in an 11-page report ordered by the U.N.
Security Council after the Oct. 8 killings of 20 Arabs by Israeli
forces during rioting in Arab east Jerusalem. The council has
already condemned Israel for the bloodshed.
   Israel's U.N. mission rejected the secretary-general's comments
as interference and said Israel has sole control of the
territories.
   The Foreign Ministry scheduled a briefing for reporters on the
latest U.N. move, then canceled it. Ministry officials said they
stood by the Israeli U.N. mission's response.
   Yossi Achimeir, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, told
the daily newspaper Davar that Israel was ``doing everything'' to
ensure the security of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``If there is any lack of security it derives from the violent
activities of the Arabs against Israelis and their own brethern,''
Achimeir was quoted as saying.
   Misha Harish of the opposition Labor Party said the center-left
party rejected the call for an international meeting. But his
statement criticized Shamir for refusing any U.N. investigation of
the Temple Mount deaths.
   ``Shamir is creating unnecessary conficts with the president of
the United States and the rest of the nations of the world,''
Harish said.
   Diplomats quoted in the Haaretz newspaper said they were
concerned by Perez de Cuellar's suggestion. The meeting by the 164
nations that signed the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention would be to
consider how to protect Palestinians in the disputed lands.
   The diplomats expressed fears that an another Israeli rejection
of a U.N. action would erode the Jewish state's international
standing, Haaretz said.
   The fears by the unidentified diplomats were echoed by veteran
statesman Abba Eban, who said the continued focus of U.N. attention
on Israel was harmful not only to the Jewish state but to the Arab
and Western alliance against Iraq.
   ``There are many in the country ... who believe there has been
damage ... by all this activity around our problem at a time when
the main interest of Israel now is to actually help strengthen the
great coalition that was formed against Saddam Hussein,'' the
former foreign minister told army radio.

   On Thursday, the White House said Bush will go to Paris Nov.
19-21 for a 34-nation arms control summit.
   The projected centerpiece of the summit will be the signing of

control accord in history.
   It would set limits on tanks, anti-aircraft artillery and
various other categories of non-nuclear weapons from the Atlantic

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for four Kenyans charged with
treason tody told a magistrate that they had been tortured while
in custody.
   The four, who include a former legislator and two lawyers, are
charged with plotting the overthrow of President Daniel arap Moi's
one-party government, a crime punishable by death.
   They were among suspected dissidents arrested following
demonstrations urging democratic changes.
   Koigi wa Wamwere, a former legislator, lawyers Mirugi Kariuki
and Rumba Kinuthia, and Geofrey Kuga Kariuki ``have been subjected
to torture and degrading and inhuman conditions'' since their
arrest last month, lawyer John Khaminwa told the court. He did not
provide specifics.
   Magistrate Omondi Tunya ruled the torture claims could only be
discussed in the High Court on Nov. 7 during the hearing of a
previous plea by three defense lawyers. On Thursday, lawyers for
three of the detainees asked the High Court to order prison
authorities to permit them to see their clients.
   The lawyers said officials at Kamiti prison in a Nairobi suburb
prevented them and a doctor from seeing Wamwere and Mirugi Kariuki
on Oct. 26.
   Tunya agreed with the state attorney's argument that the lawyers
should arrange their intended visits to their clients well in
advance with prison authorities.
   The accused first appeared in court 10 days after their arrest
Oct. 19. The government had earlier announced police seized machine
guns and grenades Oct. 8 in arresting Wamwere.
   Wamwere, a critic of the Kenyan establishment, had lived in
self-exile in Norway since 1986 and belonged to an opposition
underground group calling itself the Kenya Patriotic Front.
   Kinuthia and Mirugi Kariuki practiced law. Geofrey Kariuki's
background was unknown.
   On Oct. 22, Kenya broke diplomatic relations with Norway,
accusing the Nordic nation of meddling in internal affairs by
seeking to help Wamwere.
   Norway did not protest Wamwere's arrest, but it objected to
Kenya's refusal to allow Norwegian diplomats to check on his
welfare or offer legal assistance.

<HEAD>Japan Starts to Resume Loan Program Frozen After Tiananmen Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan announced today it was resuming a development
loan program for China that has been frozen since the brutal
suppression of pro-democracy protests in Beijing last year.
   Japan will make available up to $283 million to China for seven
projects in an effort ``to contribute to economic stability and to
promote the economic modernization efforts of the country,'' the
Foreign Ministry said.
   It said in a statement that Japan's ambassador to China, Hiroshi
Hashimoto, and Qi uaiyuan, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official,
exchanged a memorandum of understanding on the plan.
   The funds are part of a five-year package of development loans
to China totaling $6.28 billion. The money was frozen by Tokyo to
condemn China's crack down on the pro-democracy protests in June
1989.
   But in July, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu promised to gradually
resume the loans, putting Japan ahead of Western industrialized
nations in relaxing sanctions on Communist China.
   ``What we have decided is to release this frozen aid step by
step in accordance with the pace of change in China,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   He said Japan welcomed China's cooperation with the West in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Other industrialized democracies also have been gradually easing
sanctions on China in recent months.
   The European Community agreed last week to end its ban on
high-level diplomatic contacts with China and to go ahead with soft
loans. Spain's foreign minister is expected to visit China in
several weeks.
   The United States also has allowed the resumption of some trade
credits from the Export-Import Bank as well as World Bank loans,
and is expected to gradually resume high-level visits.
   Bans on military sales to China are expected to continue,
however.
   The terms of the Japanese loans to China include an annual
interest rate of 2.5 percent and a 30-year repayment period. Japan
will not require that Japanese companies be involved in the
programs.
   The development projects to be financed by the loans include
construction of a bridge, two dams and three chemical fertilizer
plants, as well as urban water supply improvement.

   Democrat Harvey Gantt pledged that he would
stay on the ``high road'' in the final days of his campaign against
Sen. Jesse Helms as polls showed the candidates locked in close
contention.
   While both candidates made personal appearances Thursday,
attention focused on Helms' televisi funeral of Emperor Hirohito in February
last
year.
   Although police mobilized 32,000 officers in Tokyo to guard that
ceremony, the Chukaku-ha set off a bomb along the funeral
procession route. The bomb exploded before the procession arrived,
and no one was injured.
   Over the past month, police have announced uncovering alleged
plots by the Chukaku-ha to jam television broadcasts of the
coronation and fire rockets at a tunnel along a train route the
emperor is to travel later this month.
   The radical group is believed to have mortar-style weapons with
a range of 4 miles.

   The front of a store selling the strike-torn
Daily News was hit by arsonists today and two delivery men were
attacked but the newspaper says it distributed more than a million
papers.
   The violence came after more than 13,000 union supporters
rallied in front of the News building on Thursday, temporarily
closing a block on 42nd Street.
   Dozens of labor leaders and politicians urged the strikers to
continue their fight. Cardinal John O'Connor sent a letter saying,
``I do not believe that union members wanted to initiate the
current strike.''
   Police initially estimated the crowd at 5,000 but later changed
their estimate to 13,000. They reported no arrests or injuries
during the demonstration, but several scuffles erupted.
   The News says it printed and distributed 1.06 million copies
despite a strike by nine of its 10 unions, but availability of the
paper remained spotty.
   In the Rego Park section of Queens today, a stationery store was
hit by arson a little after 4 a.m., said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a
police spokeswoman.
   The store's owner said he was warned over the past few days not
to sell the paper. He told police he has not stocked it for four
days.
   The Fire Department found flammable liquid at the store, which
was burned on the outside and slightly inside, Mohrmann said.
   Also early today, a replacement worker driving a News truck on
the Long Island Expressway sustained a small cut on his hand when a
large rock crashed through the windshield, Mohrmann said. No
arrests were made.
   Later, two security guards escorting a Daily News truck were
attacked by three bat wielding men who drove up to their car and
broke the windshield, Mohrmann said.
   The two victims were taken to a nearby hospital with facial
injuries, she said.
   Some Daily News employees continued to cross picket lines and
return to work, including Betty Liu Ebron, whose byline reappeared
Thursday on the Apple Sauce column.
   Labor lawyer Theodore Kheel, an unpaid adviser to the News'
unions, offered to buy the nation's second-largest metropolitan
daily.
   He told the Tribune Co., the Chicago-based owner of the News,
that he had lined up American investors and would be able to
negotiate contracts with the unions and work out a joint operating
agreement with the New York Post.
   ``The paper is not for sale,'' said Lisa Robinson, a News
spokeswoman.
   Eight of the News' 10 unions went on strike Oct. 25, joined a
day later by the Newspaper Guild, over what they term unfair labor
practices. Violence rocked the first nights of the strike when
pickets damaged delivery trucks and buses carrying replacement
workers.

<HEAD>Researchers Discover Family's Genetic Defect for Aneurysms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Air Force Capt. Michele Hegler said
fear of developing the kind of aneurysm that killed five of her
relatives led to her participation in research that has uncovered a
genetic cause of the disease.
   ``I was scared, but I didn't hesitate because so many in our
family had died,'' the Houston resident said Thursday. ``Now that I
know, my family and I can take precautions.''
   Thomas Jefferson University researchers announced a discovery
Thursday that linked Mrs. Hegler's genetic defect to aortic
aneurysms, a disorder that afflicts about 2 million Americans.
   The university researchers also said they developed a saliva
test to detect the mutation, which can be used to identify which of
Mrs. Hegler's relatives are at risk.
   ``Our study proves for the first time that there is a genetic
cause for aortic aneurysms in people who do not have any other
signs of a genetic disease,'' said Dr. Darwin Prockop, the lead
researcher.
   For someone with the genetic defect, Prockop said their chances
of developing an aneurysm is almost 100 percent.
   In 1988, physicians discovered while examining Mrs. Hegler that
several family members had died from ruptured aortic aneurysms. An
aortic aneurysm is a balloonlike swelling in the body's largest
blood vessel.
   Of the 2 million Americans at risk of developing an aortic
aneurysm during their lives, some 15,000 die each year die when the
aneurysms burst, causing massive bleeding. The ruptures most often
occur in the arteries of the heart and brain.
   The discovery is ``a major breakthrough that can now offer
physicians a way of anticipating and preventing the dire
consequences of aortic aneurysms,'' said Dr. Roger Ladda of the
Penn State Medical Center.
   Ladda said scientists can build on the work to detect similar
mutations in other families and possibly uncover a ``universal
mutation.''
   The study was reported in Thursday's Journal of Clinical
Investigation, published by Rockefeller University in New York.
   The researchers discovered a single mutation among the 30,000
units in the gene responsible for a protein that is part of the
building blocks that make up the blood vessels' walls. Mrs.
Hegler's defective protein weakens the vessel walls, leading to the
rupture.
   Prockop said they focused on the collagen, called type III
procollagen, because it determines the strength of the aortic
walls.
   Prockop and the scientists found the same defect in preserved
tissue samples of Mrs. Hegler's mother, who died in 1960, and her
aunt, who died in 1986. Both suffered ruptured aortic aneurysms.
   The researchers then developed a test to look for the same
defect in other relatives.
   Mrs. Hegler said 10 relatives agreed to join the research, and
four - including Mrs. Hegler's two children and her brother - carry
the defective gene.
   Mrs. Hegler's 15-year-old son no longer plays football and her
17-year-old daughter has dropped gymnastics. The family goes
together for checkups to detect any aneurysms.
   Physicians had attributed most aneurysms in people without any
known genetic disease to atherosclerosis, which also weakens blood
vessels while clogging them with cholesterol.
   If a physician discovers an aneurysm before it ruptures,
surgeons can repair the blood vessel by patching it, much like a
tire. But almost all patients whose aortic aneurysms rupture die
despite emergency surgery, Prockop said.
   In a related development, detailed ``maps'' of the brain
developed by University of Florida physicians are allowing doctors
to treat 90 percent of the formerly untreatable brain aneurysms.
   Dr. Arthur Day, of the university's Department of Neurosurgery,
reported an ``outstanding rate of safety and success'' in
diagnosing and surgically treating 80 patients with aneurysms of
the ophthalmic segment of the carotid artery over the past nine
years.
   The carotid artery carries the major part of the brain's blood
supply, while the ophthalmic segment is named for its location near
the branch that supplies blood to the eye.
   Day credits much of his success in safely reaching and treating
ophthalmic segment aneurysms to the detailed studies of the brain's
anatomy undertaken by Dr. Albert Rhoton, chairman of the Department
of Neurosurgery.

   Hyosuke Niwa, a 79-year-old former Japanese labor
minister, died today of heart failure caused by excessive bleeding,
officials said. His death came 12 days after he was stabbed by a
mental patient.
   An autopsy report revealed Niwa was given the wrong blood type
during emergency transfusions, which could have contributed to his
death.
   Niwa had been in a coma in Aichi Medical University Hospital
since he was stabbed, said a spokesman for the hospital in central
Japan.
   Niwa, who had type O blood, was given type B blood during
transfusions at two hospitals, according to the autopsy by medical
staff at Nagoya University.
   Heart failure was listed as the official cause of death, but
officials suspect the transfusion mistake may have hastened Niwa's
death, Kyodo News Service reported.
   Mixing blood types can cause red blood cells to rupture and
clump together. Niwa had been in a coma in Aichi Medical University
Hospital since he was stabbed, said a spokesman for the hospital in
central Japan.
   Niwa was attacked Oct. 21 while walking to a military ceremony
at the Moriyama military base in Nagoya, 170 miles west of Tokyo.
He was stabbed by a 47-year-old mental patient with a knife, police
said.
   Niwa, a 12-term member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party
in Parliament, was labor minister from December 1988 to June 1989
in the Cabinet of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Niwa was survived by his wife Yuriko, son Takamitsu, and
daughters Atsuko, Setsuko and Yoshimi.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Settles Dispute Over Republican Gubernatorial
Ticket</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Supreme Court has settled a
dispute over the Republican gubernatorial ticket that arose when
Jon Grunseth withdrew from the race amid allegations of sexual
misconduct.
   The court voted 5-2 Thursday to reject Sharon Clark's claim that
she should be the candidate for lieutenant governor on the ballot
with primary runner-up Arne Carlson.
   Clark's attorney had argued that Clark was legally entitled to
the lieutenant governor's candidacy because she won the Sept. 11
primary as Grunseth's running mate.
   Grunseth withdrew Sunday after reports that he swam nude with
teen-age girls nine years ago and had a mistress during both of his
marriages.
   But the court said Secretary of State Joan Growe did not err in
deciding Joanell Dyrstad - Carlson's primary running mate - should
join him on supplementary ballots for the Nov. 6 election.
   Chief Justice Peter Popovich, in a sharply worded two-page
dissent, said the Republican Party had failed to fulfill ``the
basic duty owed to its members'' by asking the court to settle the
dispute.
   ``Avoiding its duty and requiring the court to settle the
political differences within that party is disrespectful of the
role of the judiciary and a misuse of the judicial process,''
Popovich wrote.
   The dispute began after the Minnesota Independent-Republican
Party's executive committee on Tuesday decided the party had no
committee empowered to fill the vacancy created by Grunseth's
withdrawal.
   Given the party's conclusion, Growe said state law requires that
the runner-up in the primary become the GOP nominee.
   Party officials said the committee decided to leave the
running-mate decision to the court.
   Clark thanked the court for hearing the case and pledged ``100
percent'' support to Carlson and Dyrstad.
   ``I had to do what I felt was right, and what I owed the primary
voters,'' she said in a statement.
   Growe said she would order supplementary, paper ballots for the
governor's race to be printed by 5 p.m. Friday.
   A 1972 constitutional amendment mandated that candidates for
governor and lieutenant governor run as teams to insure that the
candidates would be ``substantially politically and personally
compatible,'' Chief Deputy Attorney General Jack Tunheim said in a
brief filed on Growe's behalf.
   Popovich rejected that argument in his dissent.
   ``The inevitable result of this reasoning is that an incumbent
governor could not appear on the ballot if the lieutenant governor
withdrew at th last minute,'' he wrote. ``Doubtless, the
Legislature could not have intended such an unreasonable and absurd
result.''

   Two people died today of injuries
suffered during three days of anti-Hindu rioting caused by a
Hindu-Moslem religious dispute in neighboring India, hospital
officials said.
   The deaths raised to three the number of people killed in
violent confrontations in Dhaka and 12 other Bangladeshi cities.
News reports said 350 people have been injured.
   Curfews imposed on Wednesday in Dhaka and the southern port of
Chittagong were due to be lifted briefly today to allow Moslems to
attend sabbath prayers. The two cities were the worst hit by
anti-Hindu rampages.
   Two of the dead were Moslems, and the third was not identified.
All suffered gunshot wounds, but it was not clear who shot them.
   The trouble began in Chittagong on Tuesday night following
reports that Hindu fundamentalists tried to seize a mosque and
replace it with a Hindu temple in the Indian town of Ayodhya. More
than 200 people have died in Hindu-Moslem violence in India.
   In Bangladesh, an Islamic country with a Hindu minority,
newspapers reported hundreds of demonstrators were injured when
anti-Hindu gangs clashed with police in Dhaka, Chittagong and
Barisal.
   Dainik Bangla, a government-owned daily newspaper, said police
used steel-tipped batons to disperse 400 Moslems who tried to break
into a Hindu temple in Barisal, 75 miles south of Dhaka. At least
50 people were injured.
   In Dhaka,the capital, riot police armed with tear gas guns and
truncheons wounded about 100 people who tried to ``vandalize and
loot Hindu-owned shops and temples,'' said Ittefaq, an independent
Bengali-language daily. It said nine people were hospitalized.
   In Chittagong, the country's second largest city, 500 Moslems
attacked a Hindu village with knives and homemade bombs Thursday
night, witnesses said.
   They said 50 people were injured in an attack at Patharganj, and
another 50 were injured in anti-Hindu violence in Boalkhali, Anwara
and Hathazari.
   Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan, has a population of 110
million, 88 percent of whom are Moslems. Ten percent are Hindus.
   On Thursday, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad called out the
army in Dhaka and ordered security forces to take ``tough action
against the forces who are trying to disrupt peace and harmony.''
He visited a Hindu temple in Dhaka, which was earlier vandalized by
Moslem gangs.

<TEXT>
   The government today ordered the army to
seize weapons and close checkpoints operated by militias in the
Christian enclave seized from rebel Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The announcement by Defense Minister Albert Mansour was the
latest step in President Elias Hrawi's plan to remove all militias
from Beirut and eventually disband and disarm them.
   But the government order was confined only to a 80-square-mile
strip of territory north of Beirut and did not appear to signal a
general crackdown on private armies in Beirut and its environs.
   The militias are responsible for most of the estimated 150,000
deaths during Lebanon's 15{-year-old civil war.
   Christian leaders Samir Geagea and George Saddeh had demanded
the removal of Syrian-backed militias who have moved into Aoun's
territory since the general's 11-month-old mutiny was crushed Oct.
13. More than 550 people were killed and 1,200 wounded in the
Syrian-led attack.
   Mansour said in an order to the army commander, Gen. Emile
Lahoud: ``All military manifestations should be removed. The
possession and transport of illegal weapons should be banned.''
   The directive allows the army to ``raid suspected weapons
caches'' and prevent the militias in Aoun's former territory
maintaining checkpoints there.
   It also said buildings seized by militias by force and used as
centers for the private armies should be ``turned over to their
legal owners.''
   The directive said ``in the event of disobediance, force is to
be used.''
   There were no response by two Syrian-supported militias in the
area, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party and Christian gunmen led
by militia chieftain Elie Hobeika. Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon and a backer of Hrawi, is likely to tell them to comply
with Mansour's directive.
   But Hrawi faces considerable difficulties in his ultimate aim of
disbanding and disarming Lebanon's private armies under an Arab
Leage-mediated peace plan to end the civil war.
   The four main Christian and Moslem militias have pledged to
withdraw their fighters from a ``Greater Beirut'' in line with the
government plan.
   The militias are the Lebanese Forces, the Druse Moslem
Progressive Socialist Party; the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah, or Party of God; and the more secular, Syrian-backed
Shiite Amal movement.
   The peace pact, ratified by Parliament, calls for the equal
distribution of power between the majority Moslems and the long
dominant Christians.
   Aoun, like Hrawi a Christian, had opposed the pact because it
had no guarantee for the removal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

   A congressional investigative report that
accuses former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce of being less than
honest in the HUD scandals also points a finger at Congress itself.
   The report by the House Government Operations Committee, ending
a 16-month investigation of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development by its housing subcommittee, said Congress as well as
the administration should end practices that bring political
influence to federal housing decisions.
   ``There is a need to take politics and discretion out of housing
programs,'' the report said. ``This applies equally to the
executive and legislative branches.''
   Congress allotted some $30 million for 40 housing projects
favored by House and Senate members in the supplemental
appropriations bill for fiscal 1990, which ended Sept. 30. Similar
projects were funded in appropriations for the current fiscal year
as well.
   ``Just as it was wrong for HUD under Secretary Pierce to dole
out housing units and grants to former HUD officials and the
politically well-connected, ... so too Congress should not earmark
funding for housing projects,'' the report said. ``This practice by
Congress, which circumvents objective criteria, competition and
merit, should be ended,'' it said.
   The bulk of the report was approved unanimously by Democratic
and Republican members of the panel. That section supported the
position of current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who unsuccessfully
opposed congressional earmarking of specific housing projects.
   The focus of the panel's final report was Pierce, HUD secretary
for all eight years of the Reagan administration, who is under
investigation by court-appointed special prosecutor Arlin Adams.
   Meanwhile, Adams and his staff appeared before the special grand
jury empaneled earlier this year to consider evidence in the case.
It was Adams' first appearance before the panel since it was
convened. Investigators carried large charts into the grand jury
room.
   The congressional report left unanswered whether Pierce broke
any federal laws or committed perjury in his sworn testimony to the
subcommittee last year, saying that was a question for Adams to
pursue.
   But it said there was evidence that Pierce and other HUD
officials misled Congress and concealed the full nature and extent
of abuses at the department - as well as their own involvement.
   ``At best, Secretary Pierce was less than honest and misled the
subcommittee about his involvement in abuses and favoritism in HUD
funding decisions,'' the report said. ``At worst, Secretary Pierce
knowingly lied and committed perjury during his testimony.'
   Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, blasted the ``spurious
allegations'' of the report.
   ``It sounds like the last gasp of a politically oriented and
motivated investigation that failed to uncover one piece of
evidence supporting their suggested conclusion that Secretary
Pierce benefited directly or indirectly,'' Perito said.
   ``They may disagree with him on the way HUD was managed. That is
not a violation of federal law.''
   Pierce appeared before the investigative subcommittee in May
1989, but later invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination in refusing to submit to further questioning.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said Pierce tried to
distance himself from abuses and political favoritism at HUD before
the panel.
   ``He stated that he `never told these people to fund
anything,''' Lantos said. ``However, sworn testimony from other
witnesses and a paper trail of documents suggest that he was
directly and intimately involved in the abuses and favoritism in
HUD funding decisions.''
   The report said the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program,
which provided grants to private developers to renovate housing for
the poor, ``became a cash cow which was milked by former HUD
officials and the politically well-connected.''
   Among the consultants who collected fees for helping obtain
grants for developers was former Interior Secretary James Watt.
   Abuses in that program alone could cost the government $413
million in overpayments, the report said, while other HUD problems
will cost taxpayers more than $1 billion.
   The report also cited a pattern of favoritism shown to Pierce's
former New York law firm - Battle, Fowler, Jaffin and Kheel -
including assistance to clients who were seeking Moderate
Rehabilitation grants.

   Fighting between mine workers
of different tribes erupted at a coal mine in Natal Province,
injuring 11 people, and five people died in other violence,
officials said today.
   The mine clash between Zulus and Xhosas occurred Thursday night
at the Kilbarchan coal mine near Newcastle, 150 miles southeast of
Johannesburg, said the Genmin company, which operates the mine.
   It said one of the injured was in serious condition. Four of the
casualties were security personnel hurt while trying to stop the
fighting.
   Also in Natal, two people were killed and seven wounded when a
group of unidentified assailants opened fire with automatic weapons
Thursday night on three houses in Stanger, police said.
   Two more people died in separate Natal shootings, and a body
with stab wounds was found in the Tembisa black township near
Johannesburg, police said.
   Factional fighting pitting Zulus loyal to the conservative
Inkatha Freedom Party against Xhosas and other blacks linked to the
African National Congress has killed about 800 people in townships
near Johannesburg since August.
   The unrest spread from Natal Province, where five years of
warfare has killed 5,000 people.
   The government this week lifted emergency restrictions on 11
Johannesburg-area townships but ordered curfews and roadblacks in
three townships outside Cape Town wracked by recent unrest.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok ordered the curfews to begin
Thursday night in the townships of Khayelitsha, Crossroads and
Lingulethu.
   ANC spokesman Trevor Manuel called it a ``high-handed, bully-boy
action,'' likely to anger residents. Speaking from Cape Town, he
said violence would not end until town councilors in the townships
step down.
   Many anti-apartheid militants see the black councils as
collaborators with the white-led national government.
   Police reinforcements from Pretoria were called in to enforce
the 9 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew after Vlok declared the townships
``unrest areas.''
   Officers set up barriers leading into the townships and searched
cars as they entered.

<HEAD>Iranian Flag Flies Again In London With Modest Hope For Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian diplomats today raised their nation's flag
over their embassy for the first time in 20 months, part of a
diplomatic thaw that has stirred hopes of freedom for British
hostages in Lebanon.
   The ceremony was attended by two friends of journalist John
McCarthy, one of three Britons believed held by pro-Iranian Moslem
extremists. They delivered a letter asking for a meeting with
Charge d'Affaires Seyyed Shamsoddin Khareghani.
   ``Relations between Iran and Britain have a long history with
its ups and downs,'' Khareghani noted in a brief speech at the
embassy in Kensington, west London.
   ``There are many grounds for cooperation between the two
countries ... particulary with regard to current issues in the
Midle East and the Persian Gulf region,'' he said.
   Britain and Iran severed ties in March 1989 after Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini called on Moslems to kill British-born author
Salman Rushdie for his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslems
consider the book blasphemous.
   Relations were restored last month. Since Khomeini's death in
June 1989, Iran has sought better relations with the West.
   The London embassy will have five diplomats to match the number
of British envoys who returned to Tehran last week.
   At the brief ceremony, the flag of Pakistan was lowered and
replaced with the green, white and red flag of Iran. Pakistan
looked after Iranian interests in Britain during the dispute.
   Foreign Office Secretary William Waldegrave said last week that
Iran was trying to be helpful in efforts for the release of the
hostages, many of whom are believed held by terrorist groups with
ties to Iran. But he noted Britain does not have diplomatic ties
with Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   Thirteen Western hostages, including six Americans, are believed
held in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the
longest-held hostage.

<HEAD>Student Leaders Accept Administration Offer of Temporary Center</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A weeklong sit-in by Smith College
students protesting for a multicultural center ended today with
students voting on a compromise.
   ``We're thrilled that we've reached an agreement. It has been an
exhausting process,'' school spokeswoman Debra Bradley said.
   Under the agreement proposed Thursday, the administration will
convert Hampshire House, a center for commuter students, into a
temporary home for cultural groups.
   As many as 60 protesters had occupied the halls of Smith's main
administration building since Oct. 26, refusing to move until
administrators came up with firm plans for a center that would
serve the interests of minority and foreign students.
   About 17 percent of the exclusive women's school's 2,600
students are non-white.
   Students had asked that another building, Lilly Hall, be turned
into the multicultural center and although they were happy with the
compromise, they have not given up that goal, said Vivian Chiang,
chairwoman of the Asian Students Association.
   ``Most of us all are just so happy it's over because we're so
tired, but I can guarantee that there's still skepticism,'' she
said. ``It's a stopgap for this year. I just want to make sure that
the administration doesn't forget that it's a stopgap.''
   Although ballots were not expected to be completely tallied
until day's end, Chiang said the compromise had been accepted by
leaders of all seven organizations.
   A meeting was scheduled today between the students and a group
of architects conducting a study on space reallocation at Smith
that school officials said could uncover a permanent home for the
center.
   Currently, only the Black Student Alliance and Nosotras, a
Hispanic group, have space in Lilly Hall. Both groups supported the
protest.
   Administrators said turning all of Lilly Hall into a
multicultural center was impossible because it would mean evicting
the School of Social Work and the Graduate Office.
   But administrators have promised to find a permanent home for
the multicultural center.
   The debate over a multicultural center has been raised
periodically at Smith since 1983.
   Protesters said the college seems more concerned about
recruiting minority students than helping them once they arrive.

<HEAD>Thatcher in Crisis After Deputy Prime Minister Quits</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs after 3rd, `Publicly, key...' to UPDATE with
report of Howe's replacement. Pickup 4th, `Howe's resignation...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's opponents had a
field day today after her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, quit in
protest of her resistance to Britain's integration into the
European Community.
   ``Instead of having a leader who holds the party together ... we
have one who unfortunately allows the party to break up,'' said
ex-prime minister Edward Heath, who himself was ousted by Mrs.
Thatcher as party leader in 1975.
   Publicly, key aides in Mrs. Thatcher's 22-member Cabinet rallied
round, although they take a more conciliatory policy than the prime
minister in the drive toward European union.
   Government sources said today that Education Secretary John
MacGregor had been chosen to replace Howe as leader of the House of
Commons, according to Press Association, the domestic news agency.
It was not known whether anyone would assume Howe's additional
title of deputy prime minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher, her government in disarray and looking
increasingly embattled, was closeted at her 10 Downing Street
office ``working on a couple of speeches for next week,'' a
spokeswoman said.
   Howe's resignation late Thursday prompted speculation that he or
another senior lawmaker may try to oust her as leader of the
Conservative Party - and thus the premiership - in a challenge this
winter.
   But many observers believe a leadership challenge would be too
risky for the party, now less than two years from the June 1992
deadline for the next general election.
   Howe, 63, a soft-spoken man who had come to irritate Mrs.
Thatcher profoundly, according to political insiders, handed his
resignation to her without notice in a 30-minute interview on
Thursday evening.
   He cited ``a growing difference'' between them over Britain's
role in Europe. ``We need to persuade friends as well as challenge
opponents. ... We should be in the business, not of isolating
ourselves unduly, but of offering positive alternatives,'' he said.
   Mrs. Thatcher responded that she did not believe their
differences ``are nearly so great as you suggest,'' and said she
was saddened by his departure.
   Howe had stayed on as deputy prime minister after Mrs. Thatcher
removed him as foreign secretary against his will last year.
   The end came for him when she lashed out after a European
Community summit in Rome last weekend. The leaders agreed 11-1 to
set a timetable for monetary union and debated proposals for closer
political ties.
   Mrs. Thatcher shouted ``No, No, No!'' during a rowdy debate in
the Commons on Tuesday and ducked an invitation to back Howe.
   London's Financial Times reported today that Mrs. Thatcher had
berated Howe at Thursday morning's regular Cabinet meeting over his
organization of parliamentary business.
   Howe was the last survivor of the 21-member Cabinet named by
Mrs. Thatcher when she first won power in 1979. His departure left
her government in apparent disarray and the prime minister
increasingly embattled.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher may tower over her party as she towers over all
she surveys,'' commented the pro-Thatcher London newspaper The
Times. ``But the tower is an ever-more lonely one.''
   ``The truth is that the problem is not a Cabinet minister here
or a Cabinet minister there,'' said Paddy Ashdown, leader of the
small Liberal Democratic Party. ``The problem is the prime
minister.''
   Some commentators had predicted the Howe resignation because of
a growing divide in the party over Europe. The liberal newspaper
The Guardian today called his departure ``the final body blow to
the Thatcher government.''
   The split over Europe has blown up with the Thatcher government
already in deep trouble. For 16 months it has lagged behind the
Labor Party in poll ratings, and is now a daunting 16 points
behind.
   The government's unpopularity is mainly over high interest
rates, 10.9 percent inflation, a new local government tax that has
backfired and criticism of Mrs. Thatcher's rigorous style.
   In 1986, two Cabinet ministers quit in a dispute over whether a
European or U.S. consortium should rescue Britain's ailing Westland
helicopter company.
   Last October, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson resigned
over Mrs. Thatcher's stalling on linking the pound to other
European currencies.
   In July, Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley, whose views were
believed close to those of Mrs. Thatcher, was forced to quit after
calling moves toward monetary union a ``German racket.''
   Howe now reverts to being a rank-and-file legislator, joining
the ranks of senior dissidents. They include former Defense
Secretary Michael Heseltine, the most popular choice, according to
polls, to succeed Mrs. Thatcher. He has also been obliquely
criticizing her policy on Europe.

<TEXT>
   The Boston Herald today endorsed Democratic
candidate John Silber for governor, saying he can restore the
public's lost faith in government.
   ``John Silber means change,'' the newspaper said. ``And change
is what we need.''
   The Herald said Republican William Weld's posts as a former U.S.
attorney and Justice Department official ``have simply not prepared
him for the compex job of running the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.''
   ``Over the next four years, the governorship of Massachusetts is
certainly no job for the faint of heart,'' the Herald's front-page
editorial said. ``John Silber is the right man for the job.''
   Weld won The Boston Globe's endorsement Thursday.
   The Globe also praised Silber - who is on leave as president of
Boston University - for his intelligence and competence in his
professional field, but faulted him for his ``tart-tongued
behavior'' and his ``intimidating tactics.''
   It said Weld's leadership style was more likely to get results.
   The Herald said Silber's rapid rise in popularity is ``a
reflection of the public's anger.
   ``If John Silber has captured the sense of public outrage, he
has also captured its sense that anything is possible if you work
hard to make it happen.''

   A 10-year-old was recovering today from
surgery to remove his right eye after he was attacked on his way
home from school, a hospital spokesman said.
   Doctors removed the fourth-grader's eye and wired his jaw on
Thursday, in the second operation since the Oct. 22 attack, said
spokesman Phil Van Stavern at Children's Hospital of Oklahoma in
Oklahoma City.
   The boy was in fair condition and doing a little walking on his
own, Van Stavern said.
   The boy told police he was walking home from school when a man
approached him to ask for help finding a dog. The man chased and
caught the boy, who was found later that night in brush near the
school.
   The assailant also lacerated the boy's genitals andcut his
other eye. Van Stavern said those injuries would not be permanent.
   No arrests have been made, police said. Norman is 25 miles south
of Oklahoma City.

   Three police sergeants who were demoted for
being overweight have been reinstated but ordered into a
weight-loss program, the police commissioner said.
   ``We looked into it and determined that it was better to have
the people in a weight-loss program and not tie it into their
promotions,'' Commissioner Willie L. Williams said.
   Officers Stephen Guckin, Joseph McGoldrick and John Harkins will
still be required to lose weight, but will not have to meet a
deadline.
   The three were promoted in April, but demoted last month when a
physical revealed they had not lost weight. The action was taken
because the three had signed agreements to lose the weight.
   Guckin was expected to lose 40 pounds, but lost only 20 to
remain at 260. McGoldrick was supposed to lose 28 pounds, but his
weight remained stable at 291. Harkins was expected to lose 100
pounds, but lost only two and weighs 313.
   Five other officers promoted under the same agreement either met
their required goals or came close and were not disqualified.
   All officers will be required to take a physical every two years
and any officer found overweight will be assigned to a weight-loss
program, announced Williams and John Shaw, president of Fraternal
Order of Police Lodge 5.

<HEAD>U.N. Commissioner Resigns Early in Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. high commissioner for refugees, Thorvald
Stoltenberg, said today he is resigning less than a year into his
five-year term to become Norway's foreign minister.
   Stoltenberg, 59, who was foreign minister from 1987 to 1989,
said he was taking the change because it comes at a ``critical
moment for Norway.''
   His resignation after 10 months in office came as a shock to the
agency, which is facing its biggest refugee crisis ever and has
been recovering from low staff morale under its previous
leadership.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will nominate
Stoltenberg's successor. There was no immediate indication who that
would be.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees supervises programs for 15
million refugees worldwide, including 5 million Afghans in Iran and
Pakistan, about 2 million in southern Africa and the Horn of
Africa, and many in southeast Asia.
   The agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981,
has been in dire financial straits and last month approved an
11-percent cut in next year's budget, to $345.5 million.
   The U.N. General Assembly approved Stoltenberg, then Norway's
U.N. ambassador in New York, as high commissioner on Nov. 20.
   He was the only candidate nominated by Perez de Cuellar for the
post, which was vacated by Jean-Pierre Hocke of Switzerland under a
cloud of suspicion and criticism. Hocke resigned over charges that
he used a special education fund for refugees to upgrade his air
travel to first class.
   He was also criticized for alleged financial mismanagement and
favoritism, but he denied wrongdoing and nothing was proven.
   Stoltenberg is an attorney of international law and also served
as Norwegian defense minister.
   He is a key adviser to Prime Minister-elect Gro Harlem
Brundtland and a respected and popular politician in Norway.
   Refugee organizations in Norway immediately criticized his move.
   ``It is letting down the refugees, and I must protest it
strongly,'' Annette Thommessen, head the Norwegian Association of
Asylum Seekers, told the national news agency NTB.

<HEAD>A Revival of Gershwin's `Oh, Kay!' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 5 grafs with what other critics said. No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The title tells all.
   ``Oh, Kay!'' is OK, a modestly successful and often engaging
adaptation of the 1926 George and Ira Gershwin musical, which
opened Thursday at Broadway's Richard Rodgers Theater.
   That may not be enough for Broadway where only the powerhouse,
not the pleasant, survive. Producer David Merrick most likely was
hoping to repeat the success of his last show, ``42nd Street,'' the
quintessential 1930s movie musical that director Gower Champion
brought to life on stage.
   In fact, there are echoes of his production in this revival,
directed and choreographed by Dan Siretta, who usually resides at
the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut. The big dance finale in
``Oh, Kay!,'' done to two virtually unknown Gershwin songs, ``Show
Me the Town'' and ``Sleepless Nights,'' harks back to Champion's
show.
   A somewhat different version of ``Oh, Kay!'' was done at
Goodspeed several years ago. Siretta's production was adapted by
James Racheff from the original book by Guy Bolton and P.G.
Wodehouse.
   What Siretta and Racheff have done is turn ``Oh, Kay!'' into an
all-black musical, transplanting the story of bootleggers and
chorus cuties from Long Island to Harlem.
   The change does work and serves as an excuse to bring on three
sensational dancers - Gregg Burge, Kevin Ramsey and Stanley Wayne
Mathis. These men can move. Burge, who does his signature high kick
throughout the show, can earn applause just by hopping across the
stage.
   Ramsey leads the chorus in the musical's one big show stopper -
well, more like a show finisher, since it ends the first act - a
rousing religious revival version of ``Clap Yo' Hands.'' And Mathis
swivels his way through ``Fidgety Feet'' with style.
   Siretta's energetic choreography has a show biz savvy just right
for the spirited music. He's never at a loss for a strut, jump,
split, Charleston or a tap dance - particularly a tap. They pop up
with regularity throughout the evening.
   Only when he is forced to deal with long stretches of dialogue
does Siretta's perpetual motion machine slow down.
   The book shows its age, despite Racheff's tinkering. The jokes
are more than old. These gags had whiskers the day they were
written. But that doesn't stop Helmar Augustus Cooper, who barrels
through the role of bootlegger turned butler with a comic finesse
that would have made the show's original funny man, Victor Moore,
break out in giggles.
   The fun falters when the action shifts to leading lady Angela
Teek. Kay, the title character, needs to break your heart when she
sings ``Someone to Watch Over Me,'' the evening's best known song.
Teek belts the blues out of it, but the result is emotionally
barren and unaffecting. As for Teek's acting, she mugs more than
emotes.
   The musical's handsome curly-haired playboy hero is played by
Brian Mitchell with a Johnny Mathis croon. Mitchell gets to sing
one of the show's oddities, an unknown, unpublished Gershwin song
called ``Ask Me Again.'' It shouldn't remain unknown for long.
   The rest of the Gershwin score remains as heavenly as ever,
including ``Maybe,'' ``Do, Do, Do'' and ``Dear Little Girl.''
There's an honest emotion and sweet simplicity to Ira Gershwin's
lyrics that the years have not reduced to cliches. And George
Gershwin's melodies, ranging from sassy to sentimental, sound
wonderful in Arnold Goland's orchestrations.
   The settings by Kenneth Foy underwhelm but then much of the
action takes place in the playboy's Harlem living room. To
compensate, the costumes by Theoni Aldredge are star-spangled
opulent with a heavy dose of sequins.
   In the end, the production is buoyed by that glorious Gershwin
music and those three fabulous dancers. When they fly high, so does
the musical. When they are off-stage, ``Oh, Kay!'' shows its age.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ``This loose adaptation of the
Gershwins' 1926 musical is a chintzy, innocuous slab of stock that
is likely to leave more than a few theatergoers shrugging their
shoulders and asking `Didn't I doze through that a couple of
summers ago in a barn?'''
   Linda Winer, Newsday: ``For anyone who has been pining for the
thrill of dancing feet, kicky old songs and plenty of bugle beads,
there is news on Broadway for a change. Producer David Merrick,
ailing and considered out of commission for much of the decade
since `42nd Street,' has roared back with an adaptation of `Oh,
Kay!' ... that is both taut and easygoing - and a lesson on how to
make a fluff-ball old musical move.''
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: ``For the last 40 years, David
Merrick has operated on a principle many producers (and even
critics) either do not know, ignore or have forgotten: People go to
the theater, especially the Broadway theater, to have a good time.
They certainly will at `Oh, Kay!'''
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: ``Looking back, I am not at all
sure that in my heart of hearts I expected to enjoy this all-new
`Oh, Kay!' at all - and I am absolutely positive that I never
expected to enjoy it this much. The evergreen Gershwins, the
ever-hopeful Siretta, and yes, the large-named Mr. Merrick (welcome
back, David), have given us an enchanted, delicious evening.''

<HEAD>Church Opens Grave of Former Haitian Slave Up for Sainthood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anecdotes and facts about the life of a former
Haitian slave who's being considered for sainthood so far have been
easier to unearth than his bones.
   Before Cardinal John O'Connor turned the first shovelful of dirt
Thursday on what's thought to be the grave of Pierre Toussaint,
church and medical officials said they hoped to find a casket or a
skeleton.
   But three hours of digging at a Manhattan cemetery produced only
bits and pieces of bones that cannot yet be confirmed to belong to
Toussaint, whose life drew the highest praise from O'Connor as he
blessed the grave during a brief ceremony.
   ``It would be magnificent if it could eventually be determined
that he deserves to be a saint,'' O'Connor told about 100
spectators who were kept from the grave by police barricades on All
Saints Day.
   ``He was a very holy man. I wish I were as holy as he,'' the
cardinal said at Old St. Patrick's Church Cemetery in the city's
Little Italy section.
   Toussaint was buried there after his death in 1853 at age 87.
   By midafternoon, workmen had found part of a jaw with teeth that
probably belonged to a man, said Dr. Victor Tchertkoff, acting
chairman of the Department of Pathology at New York Medical
College.
   He said it would be given to an anthropological pathologist for
examination. He said other small bones appeared to be from human
ribs.
   ``We were hoping for more of a person but we didn't get what we
hoped for. Wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow is another day,'' said
Tchertkoff.
   For decades, historians have been studying the life of
Toussaint, whose last name means ``all saints.''
   Court papers filed to get permission for exhumation called
Toussaint a ``model of charity.'' He is considered the founder of
Catholic Charities because he helped the needy for 66 years when no
formal systems of assistance existed.
   Shortly after workers began digging Thursday, several children
darted through the barricades to pocket fistfuls from the growing
mound of earth as keepsakes.
   The bones must be positively identified so that the Vatican may
distribute some of them or his personal items to Haiti or prominent
places of worship.
   The examination of his remains is a preliminary step during the
period of investigation and examination of his life. The
examination occurs before he is considered for beatification, only
an early step in the overall process, which could take years.
   Church officials said it was likely that the remains of
Toussaint, his wife and stepdaughter were buried in the grave in
wooden coffins that would have disintegrated.
   Each shovelful of dirt was carefully combed for bones. Tiny
pieces of pottery, shells and animal bones also were found.
   ``It could take days yet,'' said Joseph Zwilling, a church
spokesman, of the quest to find the remains.
   Toussaint was born a slave in Haiti in 1766 and moved to New
York with his owner's family in 1787. He became one of the city's
leading hairdressers and was allowed to keep some of his income.
   When Toussaint's owner died, leaving his wife and child
impoverished, Toussaint secretly supported them for about 20 years.
The widow freed Toussaint from slavery shortly before she died in
1807.
   The church is investigating two miracles attributed to
Toussaint: the recovery of a young Haitian with cancer who refused
medical care and relied solely on prayers to Toussaint and a Miami
woman's claim he cured her breast cancer.

<HEAD>Pilot Safe After Around-the-World Floatplane Trip</HEAD>

   A pilot who landed his floatplane in
the North Pacific while completing the last leg of an
around-the-world flight was safe aboard a fishing vessel today.
   The Coast Guard was trying to determine whether his aircraft is
worth salvaging.
   Petty Officer Jeff Roberts said pilot Tom Casey was safely
aboard the fishing vessel Judy B, about 22 miles west of Kiska
Island in the western Aleutians.
   ``He's in good shape, excellent condition,'' Roberts said. ``The
last report we have is that the aircraft has a punctured pontoon
but is upright and floating. I guess he had some engine problems. .
.. Any decision about salvage will be made when the cutter
arrives.''
   Lt. Susan Hargiss said Casey alerted Coast Guard crews in Juneau
that he was in trouble shortly after 1:30 p.m. Thursday.
   A short time later, Casey was spotted by a Coast Guard C-130
transport plane responding to a distress signal from an emergency
locator beacon.
   Casey, 53, was unharmed and remained with his craft, the Liberty
II, while crews circled above late Thursday, Hargiss said.
   He is a Seattle-based pilot who was trying to complete a record
around-the-world flight by landing only on water.
   He was the first person to make the flight from Japan to Attu in
a single-engine floatplane since Charles Lindbergh logged the trip
decades ago, the Coast Guard said.
   Casey had landed his plane on oceans, and the lakes and rivers
of 20 nations.
   His around-the-world plan temporarily was stymied in Anchorage
during the summer when he was unable to gain travel clearances from
the Soviets.

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels abandoned without a fight
their stronghold on Mannar Island off Sri Lanka's northwest coast,
military officials said Friay.
   Two thousand government troops in amphibious landing craft moved
in Thursday, supported by gunboats and air cover, said the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. But there was no
sign of the rebels.
   ``We feel the Tamil terrorists bolted because the terrain of
Mannar Island does not give any encouragement for guerrilla
warfare,'' one official said.
   Soldiers sweeping the island recovered a large number of
abandoned vehicles, including an ambulance, but saw no guerrillas,
the officials said.
   There was no word on the government landing from the Liberation
Tigers for Tamil Eelam, who maintain offices in Paris and London.
   The rebels have fought a seven-year war for a homeland for the
Tamil minority in the north and east of Sri Lanka.
   The Tigers had established a stronghold on the island, blowing
up a causeway and cutting off access from the Sri Lankan mainland.
The island, 140 miles northwest of Colombo, is the closest point to
India's south coast.
   About 60 percent of the island's 100,000 residents are Tamils,
mostly Christians making a living from fishing. The rest are
Moslems.
   Last week the Tigers posted warnings to Moslems, telling them to
leave the island or be killed. Moslem refugees claimed the rebels
stripped them of all their valuables before forcing them off the
island at gunpoint.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said 50,000 Moslem
refugees had fled Mannar and the northern Jaffna peninsula, the
rebel stronghold.
   Moslems, who make up 7 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
often have been victims of the ethnic war between the Tamil
minority and the Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the population. Sinhalese comprise
75 percent, and control the government and military.
   More than 14,000 people have died after Tamil militia launched
the separatist war in 1983.

<HEAD>Atwater Says He Has `Found Jesus'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Atwater, who was accused of negative
campaigning as head of George Bush's presidential campaign, says he
has turned to the Lord since being diagnosed with cancer.
   ``I have found Jesus Christ. It's that simple. He's made a
difference, and I'm glad I've found him while there's still time,''
the Republican National Committee chairman said in an interview
published Friday in The State newspaper.
   Atwater, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor in
March, said he wants to world to know about his spiritual
conversion.
   ``I don't hate anybody anymore. For the first time in my life, I
don't hate somebody. I have nothing but good feelings toward
people. It's just no point in fighting and feuding,'' he said.
   Atwater made rapist Willie Horton a household name and turned
the Pledge of Allegiance into an attack on Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential campaign.
   ``Since I have been ill, I have found more honest, decent people
who have gotten in touch with me, that have held values that I
never knew existed,'' said Atwater, a South Carolina native.
   Atwater said he has been making peace with former foes,
Democrats and Republicans. He said he has written letters of
repentance and asked people for forgiveness.
   In a letter this summer to Columbia attorney Tom Turnipseed,
Atwater said one of the ``low points'' in his political career was
the ``jumper cables'' comment he made regarding Turnipseed's shock
treatment for depression.
   ``My hope is that you will grant a sick man a favor and try to
forget it. ... There are a very few people I need to get square
with, and you're one of them,'' Atwater wrote.
   ``Tom, this is very sincere,'' he said he added as a postscript.

   Police said today they were searching
for a man who crashed through a bedroom door at his mother's home,
stabbed four small children to death and injured three others.
   ``He went for the little ones, ages 1 to 5, in a back bedroom,''
said Leflore County Coroner James Hankins. ``I found them on the
floor and all had been stabbed in the neck with a sharp
instrument.''
   Webster County Sheriff Bill Middleton said Henry Curtis Jackson
of West Point was wanted on four counts of murder and three counts
of attempted murder.
   ``He probably believes he killed all seven of them,'' Middleton
said.
   Neighbors said the 26-year-old Jackson's mother, Martha, was at
church when the attack occurred.
   Hankins said the injured included a woman slashed in the abdomen
and two children wounded in the neck.
   The coroner said the man being sought in the slayings was
believed to be the father and uncle of the children, while the
wounded woman was the mother of at least two of the children.
   ``They all have the same last name and we're trying to sort them
all out,'' Hankins said. ``I've been in this business for 28 years
and this is as bad as I've seen.''
   Two survivors of the attack said the man entered the home and
argued with the occupants before pulling a knife and knocking down
a door to get to the children, police said.
   Neighbors were alerted when one victim ran from the home and
called for help, Hankins said. More than 100 friends and neighbors
in the low-income, Rising Sun Community - about two miles south of
Greenwood - quickly gathered, he said.
   The suspect left in a car belonging to one of the victims, ran a
stop sign and wrecked the car in Eupora, about 65 miles east of
Greenwood, about 10:30 p.m., police said.
   The suspect fled before officers arrived at the wreck. Officials
then brought in officers from area law enforcement agencies, called
off school today in Eupora and told residents to lock their doors.
   ``Right now, they're concentrating the search in an area just
north of town,'' said Roger Miller, police chief in nearby
Mathiston.
   He said tracking dogs and at least one helicopter were being
used.
   ``They think he is on foot and still in the area,'' Miller said.
``We're getting assistance from just about everywhere.''
   Regina Fay Jackson, 23, was listed in stable condition with
multiple stab wounds in the Greeenwood Leflore County Hospital,
said spokeswoman Tricia Chick. Sarah D. Jackson, 11, was listed in
serious but stable condition with stab wounds, Chick said.
   Andrea Alice Jackson, 1, was transferred to the University
Medical Center in Jackson where spokeswoman Barbara Austin said the
child was in surgery at mid-morning.
   The names of the dead were not immediately available, Hankins
said.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Mike Kopetski was just 707 votes
away from upsetting incumbent Rep. Denny Smith in 1988. This year,
with an assist from the savings and loan crisis, he may succeed.
   Smith is considered the most vulnerable House member in
Tuesday's elections, according to Roll Call, a Capitol Hill
newspaper.
   ``We're the underdog, but we're bouncing back up,'' the Oregon
Republican said. ``We're in a very tight race.''
   A poll released Friday appears to support Smith's contention
that Tuesday's vote will be close.
   Kopetski was favored by 50 percent of those interviewed in a
poll commissioned by The Oregonian newspaper, while Smith was
supported by 46 percent. The margin of error was 4 percentage
points.
   That's a significant gain for Kopetski, who was chosen by 41
percent of those interviewed in August, while 47 percent favored
Smith. The margin of error in that survey also was 4 percentage
points.
   Kopetski is hammering away at Smith's connections with several
savings and loans, contending there were improprieties with the
lawmaker's role.
   Smith, a five-term incumbent, denies any wrongdoing, saying he
only went to bat for S&amp;L directors who were being hounded by
federal regulators.
   ``I don't have anything to hide,'' Smith said.
   He was a director of the American Federal Savings and Loan
Association in Salem from 1977 to 1987. The thrift, in danger of
being seized by federal regulators, merged with Home Federal
Savings and Loan and Smith was forced off the board.
   ``People are just plain mad over the fact that Congress and the
Bush administration have failed to aggressively go after people who
still have the bucks from this national scandal,'' Kopetski said.
``They know Denny Smith helped to create this scandal.''
   The House Democratic Campaign Committee filed a complaint with
the House ethics committee accusing Smith of violating ethics rules
by using his office for personal gain in dealings involving S&amp;Ls.
   Smith called the filing a ``dirty trick'' instigated by Kopetski
and asked for quick handling of the complaint. But House leaders
decided there wasn't enough time to discuss it before Congress
adjourned Oct. 27.
   On another issue, Smith accuses Kopetski of ``cozying up'' to
Saddam Hussein because the Democrat questioned the U.S. military
deployment in the region after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Smith used radio ads, with the voice of Adolf Hitler in the
background, to suggest that Kopetski wanted to appease aggressors.
   Kopetski, who served in the Oregon House from 1985 to 1987,
calls that ridiculous and says Smith has been waging a
name-calling, negative campaign in an attempt to divert attention
from his own conduct involving S&amp;Ls.

<TEXT>
   More fires were set and more arson arrests made
this year than last during the three-day Devil's Night period,
Detroit's annual Halloween arson spree, Mayor Coleman Young said
today.
   There were 281 fires during the period from Tuesday through
Thursday compared with 223 a year ago, Young said in a midday news
conference. On Devil's Night itself, there were 141 fires, up from
115 on Oct. 30, 1989.
   Thirteen families comprising 29 people were left homeless by the
arson, the city said.
   ``That is still too many fires. But clearly, it was a long way
from being the worst night since 1984, as one highly exaggerated
report put it,'' Young said in a statement. ``Clearly, we have come
a long way from 1984, when we experienced 810 fires during the last
three days of October.''
   Young said police arrested 22 people on arson charges between
Monday and Thursday. Last year, police made eight arrests during
that period. A 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew from Monday through Thursday
for juveniles led to 326 arrests compared with 378 last year.
   The mayor called together representatives of dozens of block
clubs and community organizations that mobilized to fight the
firebugs. He read the names of every group that took part in
combatting the fires.
   On an average day, 60 fires are reported in the city.

   Police on Friday briefly detained
a member of Parliament after he refused orders to leave a township
declared an unrest area, and officers used tear gas to disperse
onlookers.
   The lawmaker, Jan van Eck of the liberal opposition Democratic
Party, was released after a few hours. Police escorted him out of
Khayelitsha, one of three black townships placed under strict
security measures Thursday.
   There was a low-level police presence in the townships on Friday
compared with the previous day, when officers set up roadblocks and
checked vehicles entering for weapons.
   There were no police blocking the road when van Eck drove into
Khayelitsha at midday with a delegation of the African National
Congress.
   Khayelitsha and the neighboring townships of Crossroads and
Lingulethu were placed under 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfews Thursday.
Security tightened under special measures giving police wider
powers to prevent demonstrations and other protests such as work
boycotts.
   In the township, van Eck visited the home of an anti-apartheid
leader. Police Maj. Gen. P.C. Fourie said he was told to leave when
he began addressing a crowd. But he refused to do so and was taken
away in a police van.
   Fourie said a crowd of about 100 people began rioting during van
Eck's arrest, and police used tear gas to restore order. No
injuries were reported.
   In other unrest-related incidents, police Friday said 11 people
were injured when Zulu and Xhosa miners battled at a mine in Natal
Province.
   Thousands of blacks have died in Natal in factional fighting
involving supporters of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and
Xhosas and other blacks backing the African National Congress.
   Both groups oppose apartheid but differ on tactics for fighting
it.
   Also in Natal, four people were shot to death in various
incidents, and the body of a man who had been stabbed was found in
a township outside Johannesburg, police said Friday. The mine clash
and shootings occurred Thursday.
   In other developments:
   -Delegations from the Inkatha Freedom Party and the right-wing
Conservative Party met for the first time since 1986. Both sides
called the talks fruitful but did not elaborate.
   -Home Affairs Minister Gene Louw announced that special travel
documents allowing political exiles entrance to South Africa will
be issued to speed their return. Louw spoke a day after the
government said it was ready to begin releasing political prisoners
and allowing the large-scale return of exiles in accordance with an
earlier agreement with the ANC.

<HEAD>Four Movies Made by Will Rogers to be Released on Video</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OOLOGAH, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of Will Rogers' classic comedies from
the 1930s will be released on video early next year, officials said
Friday.
   James Griffiths, senior vice president for 20th Century Fox,
announced the plans in Oologah, where residents of the humorist's
hometown were celebrating Will Rogers Days.
   Rogers, who was born 111 years ago Sunday, made 20 talking
movies. He died in a 1935 plane crash in Alaska.
   The four movies are among 2,000 old classics stored away in a
California movie library.
   Griffiths said the release, a joint project of 20th Century Fox
and CBS-Fox Video, was prompted by Jimmy Rogers, the humorist's
son.
   ``He is never remembered as an actor,'' Rogers said. ``I asked
dad about his career once and he said he thought of himself as an
actor. This is why we are happy to have these come out.''
   The four movies - ``Ambassador Bill,'' ``A Connecticut Yankee,''
``Mr. Skitch'' and ``Doubting Thomas'' - were picked as a
representation of Rogers' works.

<HEAD>Psychologist Says Iraqi President Achieving A Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three months after seizing Kuwait, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has what he always has wanted - a place
``at the very center of power, commanding world events, with the
entire world's attention focused on him,'' according to an expert
on Saddam's behavior.
   Those who hope that Saddam will retreat meekly from Kuwait in
the face of moralistic pronouncements from abroad won't find much
comfort in the analysis of Dr. Jerrold M. Post, a George Washington
University expert on political psychology.
   ``In pursuit of his Messianic dreams, there is no evidence he is
constrained by conscience,'' says Post, who during a long prior
career in the U.S. government founded the Center for the Analysis
of Personality and Political Behavior.
   ``When there is an obstacle in his revolutionary path, Saddam
eliminates it, whether it is a previously loyal subordinate or a
previously supportive country.
   ``In pursuing his goals, Saddam uses aggression instrumentally.
He uses whatever force is necessary and will, if he deems it
expedient, go to the extremes of violence, including the use of
weapons of mass destruction.''
   That view of a penchant for heavy-handed rule is substantiated
by David Korn, who has written about Saddam's human rights
performance for a rights monitoring group, Middle East Watc.
   Political killings, Korn says, have become ``a hallmark of the
Baath regime'' that Saddam heads. Both Korn and Post have said that
in 1982, Saddam's health minister was arrested after suggesting
that Saddam step down.
   They said that after the minister's wife pleaded with Saddam for
permission to see him, his body arrived at her doorstep in a sack,
chopped to pieces.
   Judging by the results, Post believes the politics of mass
terror at home and abroad have served Saddam well.
   ``He clears his throat and the Dow Jones average drops 60
points, he smiles and it goes up 60 points,'' says Post.
   Post says the major influence on Saddam's life was a maternal
uncle who imbued Saddam with a hatred of foreigners and notions of
Arab nationalism. The uncle's world view was summed up in a
pamphlet he wrote years ago: ``Three Whom God Should Not Have
Created: Persians, Jews and Flies.''
   Post praised President Bush's handling of the Persian Gulf
crisis, and said he believes that Saddam is prudent enough to
realize when retreat might be his wisest course.
   Post points out that Saddam showed flexibility last August when
he returned 700 square miles of territory to Iran after vowing he
would ``never'' take such a step.
   ``Never is a short time when revolutionary pragmatism dictates,
important to remember in evaluating Saddam's vow never to
relinquish Kuwait,'' Post says.
   At the same time, Post says any such retreat probably would only
be temporary.
   ``If in response to the unified demonstration of strength and
resolve he does reverse his course, it is a certainty he will
return at a later date, unless strong measures are taken to contain
him,'' he says.

   Mechanical problems on an American Airlines
jumbo jet carrying 225 passengers forced an unscheduled stop on a
flight from London to Dallas, but the plane landed safely at
Kennedy International Airport.
   The plane had a wing flap that would not contract and may have
blown a tire on takeoff from London's Gatwick Airport, said Tim
Smith, an airline spokesman in Fort Worth, Texas.
   He said there were reports that the rubber, or something from
the tire, dented a flap on the right wing. The extended flap caused
drag that used up extra fuel, so the plane was diverted to Kennedy
as a precaution, he said.
   After circling Kennedy to burn off fuel, the plane landed safely
about 1:30 p.m. EST. The plane had been scheduled to reach Dallas
at 3:50 p.m. EST.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman JoAnn Sloan
identified the plane as Flight 51.

   Diplomats said today that four more Americans in Iraq will
probably be freed this weekend, and the White House announced that
President Bush will visit America's troops in the Persian Gulf for
Thanksgiving.
   Iraqi officials, meanwhile, today allowed foreign reporters to
interview hostages from the United States, Britain and Japan.
   With the Iraqi officials standing nearby, the captives said they
eagerly want to go home but denied reports they are being
mistreated.
   ``I love freedom. When I get out of this and go home, I'll go to
the beaches and have a nice swim,'' said a man who identified
himself as Clem J. Hell, an educator from Takoma Park, Md.
   Baghdad has offered to allow hostage relatives to travel to Iraq
for the holidays, and Iraqi officials reacted angrily today to U.S.
and British efforts to discourage hostage families from accepting
the offer.
   In another development, Saudi sources said Syria is to send more
land troops to Saudi Arabia, bringing its contribution to 15,000
soldiers and 300 tanks. There had been fears that Syria might
withdraw from the multinational force against Iraqover U.S. arms
shipments to Israel.
   The White House announced that Bush will travel to Saudi Arabia
to visit some of the tens of thousands of U.S. troops who were sent
to the Middle East after Iraq invaded Kuwait and later annexed the
oil-rich emirate.
   The White House said Bush will also stop in Egypt when he heads
to the Persian Gulf region after a trip to Paris for the Nov. 19-21
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   During a campaign in Cincinnati earlier today President Bush
promised to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait while at the same time
holding out hope that the United States could bring its troops home
``without a shot being fired.''
   Bush also told a GOP rally: ``Saddam Hussein must get out, and
he must get out totally, and the legitimate rulers must be
returned.''
   Bush suggested Thursday that in some forms of brutality, the
Iraqi president had surpassed even Hitler - raising some eyebrows
by comparing Saddam to the man who ordered the extermination of
millions of people in World War II.
   Today marked the beginning of the fourth month of the Persian
Gulf crisis, which started when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Saddam refused to let foreigners leave both nations when the
United Nations retaliated by imposing a trade embargo on Iraq and
the United States began sending more than 200,000 troops to the
region.
   In announcing plans to free four sick and elderly Americans,
Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jassim denied the captives were
being treated badly.
   A U.S. official in Baghdad today identified the four to be freed
as Randall Trinh, 49, of Hacienda Heights, Calif.; Dr. Abdul Kangi,
50, of Glencoe, a Chicago suburb; Raymond Gales, a diplomat
stationed in Kuwait and now in Baghdad; and Michael Barnes.
   Trinh, a Vietnamese American, is suffering from an acute ulcer
and Gales had unspecified medical problems, the official said on
condition he not be further identified.
   No details were given on Barnes and it was not known whether
Kangi was sick. Kangi, and Indian American, was on a holy
piligrimage when the crisis started.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the government was acting on
a petition from the Arab-American Reconciliation Society.
   Diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the men
would not leave Baghad before Saturday, when government offices
reopen and paperwork can be processed. Friday is the Moslem
sabbath.
   Thousands of foreigners, including about 1,000 Americans, remain
in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq has selectively freed hundreds of them.
The latest mass release was of about 300 French nationals this
week.
   Iraq has said relatives of the hostages should come visit them
over the holidays, but Western governments have responded
skeptically and advised citizens not to travel to Iraq.
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry today criticized that reaction,
saying that the United States and Britain ``have no respect for
human values.'' Jassim said these governments ``are totally
inhumane.''
   The British Foreign Office asked relatives not to go, but 10
wives of British hostages said they will fly to Iraq next week to
seek their husbands' freedom. Other relatives welcomed Iraq's offer
to let them visit at Christmas.
   ``We know our husbands are suffering, and we just want to go
back and rescue them,'' said Dorothy Goodwin, leader of the group
of wives.
   On Thursday, Jassim insisted that ``all the Americans at sites
have complete freedom.''
   ``They can watch TV, read books and read newspapers. They also
enjoy the friendship of Iraqi forces,'' he said.
   Bush denounced the hostage-holding on Thursday and criticized
Saddam with his harshest accusations yet.
   ``They have committed ourageous acts of barbarism,'' Bush said
of Saddam's forces. ``Brutality - I don't believe that Adolf Hitler
ever participated in anything of that nature.''
   ``The brutality against innocent citizens will not be tolerated
and will not stand,'' he told an audience in Burlington, Mass.
   The remark about Hitler surprised some people in the audience.
Bush was asked later at his Florida news conference whether his
comparison might be overdrawn. ``I don't think I'm overstating
it,'' he replied.
   The president said he believed that ``Hitler did not stake
people out against military targets and he did indeed respect the
legitimacy of the embassies.''

   The prosecution rested its case today against a
woman accused of illegally using a men's restroom at a
country-western concert because the line was too long for the
women's room.
   Defense attorney Valorie Wells Davenport asked the judge to
order an acquittal for her client and sister, Denise Wells.
Municipal Judge Francelia Totty was considering the motion early
this afternoon.
   Ms. Wells, a 33-year-old legal secretary, is on trial on
misdemeanor charges of violating a city ordinance.
   The law bars members of one sex from using a public restroom
designed for members of the opposite sex in a manner calculated to
cause a disturbance. She faces a maximum $200 fine if convicted.
   Ms. Davenport said the case has generated national attention
because the issue ``is something that's touched all our lives.''
   ``It's not a gender-based thing. It's common fairness,'' she
said Thursday, when attorneys seated a jury and began testimony.
   Ms. Davenport said Ms. Wells used the men's room out of
desperation because the women's room line was too long. The
attorney told her sister not to talk to the media, and she called
the prosecution ``a silly waste of taxpayer money.''
   ``Quite frankly, I always thought Texas was big enough to come
to a lady in distress and dismiss charges like these,'' she said.
``We have four brothers. Denise grew up using the men's room.''
   Police Officer Daniel B. Ramsey testified Thursday that he was
working as a security guard July 7 at a concert at The Summit by
country-western star George Strait when he saw Ms. Wells coming out
of a men's room stall.
   ``She said in a voice that could be heard to the front of the
restroom, `There - I left the lid up, just like y'all like it,'''
Ramsey said.
   ``I think she was extremely embarrassed when she made that
remark,'' Ms. Davenport said during a recess.
   Under cross-examination, Ramsey said there were 20 women in a
line stretching into the hallway waiting to enter the women's room.
The line of people waiting to use the men's room did not reach past
the door, he said.

   Bob Stern, the 5-foot-2 president of Short
Sizes Inc., wanted to show that short men can dress for success, so
four years ago he started developing the list of the ``10
Best-Dressed Shorter Men in America.''
   At the top of the clothier's list this year: actors Tom Cruise
and Michael J. Fox and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   Cruise and Sununu are the tallest on the list. Both are
5-foot-9, the maximum height for the list.
   Stern said Cruise is a trendsetter who has turned black
sunglasses and black silk shirts into a national passion, while
Sununu ``never beats around the bush'' in both politics and dress.
   Fox, 5-foot-5, was named to the list for the third consecutive
year for ``charmingly combining a tux jacket and shirt with washed
jeans and tennis shoes,'' Stern said.
   Others listed, in ``descending'' order, are novelist Tom Wolfe
and the former host of television's ``This Old House,'' Bob Vila,
both 5-foot-8; singer Billy Joel, Broadway actor Robert Morse and
Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White, 5-foot-7; gymnast and television
sports analyst Bart Connor, 5-foot-6; and actor-director Danny
DeVito, 5-foot-1.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Humorist Minnie Pearl will celebrate her
50th anniversary Saturday night on the Grand Ole Opry, sharing the
spotlight with country music pioneer Roy Acuff.
   Pearl, 78, has requested that Acuff be on stage with her when
her golden anniversary on the country music show is observed.
   ``I want to start it with the curtain going up and Roy Acuff
singing `The Wabash Cannonball','' she said.
   Pearl also asked to spend part of the show sitting center stage
on a stool, reminiscing and joking with Acuff, 87, known as ``the
king of country music.''
   ``I love doing that, because it gives us more time with the
audience,'' she said.
   Acuff is her longtime friend and the only regular Opry performer
who started on the show before she did. He started in 1938.
   The anniversary performance will be broadcast live on cable TV's
The Nashville Network from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Kenny Rogers broke his rule against
honoring requests at concerts because someone offered to donate
$25,000 to a charity in the country singer's name.
   Rogers told the audience Wednesday he had received a letter from
a man asking Rogers to sing ``Through the Years'' as a surprise for
the man's wife on the couple's 11th anniversary. Rogers wrote the
man - Jeff Burd, 31, of Edison, N.J. - that he doesn't honor
requests.
   But Burd, a financial consultant, persisted. His second note
included an offer to give a check for $25,000 to a charity in
Rogers' name.
   Rogers said he was moved by the gesture. So he sang ``Through
the Years,'' and performed a bonus number, ``You Decorated My
Life.''
   He said the donation would benefit a shelter for the homeless in
Athens, Ga., where Rogers lives. So far, he has raised about
$150,000 to build the shelter.
   Burd and his wife, Louvette, flew to Rochester for the concert.
Backstage at the Rochester War Memorial, where Rogers was appearing
with Dolly Parton, Burd gave his check to Rogers' road manager,
Gene Roy.
   Was the serenade worth $25,000?
   ``Definitely,'' Burd said. ``Kenny did more than I could ask. I
had requested the song from me to my wife, but he sang it for both
of us. He did it better than I asked.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Maureen O'Boyle will succeed Maury Povich next
season on the syndicated ``A Current Affair'' program that Povich
has anchored since 1986, a spokesman said Friday.
   O'Boyle, a Charlotte, N.C., native who began her career at
WECT-TV in Wilmington, N.C., currently serves as anchorwoman of the
program's weekend edition. She has been anchoring the show's
weekday version the last four weeks.
   Povich, whose contract with the series expires in June, is
leaving to co-produce and star in his own talk show.
   The 51-year-old anchorman is married to CBS News star Connie
Chung, who earlier this season decided to postpone her scheduled
``Face to Face With Connie Chung'' series because she wanted to try
to have a baby. She is continuing to do ``Face to Face'' specials.

<TEXT>
   The government's gauge of future economic
health dropped 0.8 percent in September, the second straight big
decline and the third month without improvement, the Commerce
Department said Friday. Many analysts said a national recession not
only had arrived but was intensifying.
   ``The recession has begun,'' said Lawrence A. Hunter, an
economist with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``All indications are
that the employment report will get worse before it gets better as
more companies ... lay off workers and close production
facilities.''
   ``We're clearly in a recession and the data that we got today
and the data we got this week all confirm that the recession is
intensifying,'' said Elliott Platt, economic research director for
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a New York securities dealer.
   Though the Bush administration contends the economy is still
growing and will continue to do so at least into the new year, the
question for many private analysts now is rather how long and
severe the contraction will be.
   In another report pointing toward a weak economy, the Labor
Department said Friday that unemployment remained unchanged at 5.7
percent in October but that there were big job losses across the
economy.
   In all, non-farm payrolls lost 70,000 jobs, due mainly to the
slumping construction and manufacturing industries, that report
said.
   The Commerce Department reported the 0.8 percent decline in its
Index of Leading Economic Indicators following a 1.2 percent August
drop for the package of forward-looking statistics. It blends such
indicators as buyers' confidence and orders for consumer goods.
   Three consecutive declines in the index is generally viewed as a
strong - although not infallible - sign of an approaching
recession.
   ``You now have two months in a row of negative indicators with
the likelihood that October also will be negative,'' Platt said.
   The index was unchanged in July, but August's decline was the
steepest since a 1.4 percent fall a month after the October 1987
stock market crash. Although the index is designed to forecast
economic activity six to nine months in advance, many economists
agree with Platt that the economy already is in a recession.
   ``What we had was an economy that was gradually losing momentum,
sliding toward a recession ... then got hit with a series of
adverse shocks (including the Persian Gulf crisis) which pushed it
over the edge very abruptly,'' said Larry Meyer, senior economist
with Laurence H. Meyer &amp; Associates, a St. Louis economic
forecasting firm.
   ``That's one reason why we're not getting the advance warning
that we otherwise might have gotten,'' he explained.
   Many analysts predicted the October index also will be down.
Platt noted that declines already have been reported for three of
the 11 indicators - average workweek, consumer confidence and
business delivery times.
   Mark M. Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates
in West Chester, Pa., agreed the October index will be down
``fairly sizably'' and said the September report indicates the
economy ``is in for a very severe contraction at least through
1991.''
   Other economists, on the other hand, contend a recession will be
mild and the economy will pick up by the middle of next year.
   Nine of the forward-looking indicators dragged the index under
in September, while one was unchanged and one improved.
   Peter Radford of National Westminster Bancorp in New York said
the report was discouraging because it was so widespread.
   ``It's as close as you're going to get to unanimity. It's right
across all the sectors ... they are all pointing in the same
direction,'' said Radford, who predicted the index would probably
show ``more of the same'' in October.
   Contributing to the September decline were lower stock prices, a
decrease in orders for consumer goods, an increase in weekly
unemployment claims, a decline in building permits, a drop in an
index measuring consumer confidence, a decrease in unfilled orders,
a lower money supply, faster business delivery times and a decline
in the price of raw materials.
   The only positive contributor was an increase in orders for new
plants and equipment. The average workweek was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 143.3 percent of its 1982
base of 100 an down 1.1 percent from its level a year ago.

   Ethnic tensions exploded into violence in Soviet
Moldavia today when armed Moldavian nationalists and ethnic
Russians clashed east of the capital, leaving at least six people
dead and 30 wounded, Tass said.
   The casualties occurred in fighting near a village outside
Dubossary, a town of at least 10,000 people to the northeast of the
republic's capital, Kishniev, Tass said, quoting the Dubossary
deputy mayor, Alexander Parajan.
   A police officer also was wounded in a shootout in Dubossary,
and at least 2,000 workers have formed brigades to defend the
town's residents, according to Tass, the official Soviet news
agency.
   Dubossary is an area in eastern Moldavia whose predominantly
Russian and Ukrainian residents are opposed to Moldavia's secession
drive from the Soviet Union. They already have declared an
autonomous republic in the heavily non-Moldavian areas along the
Dniester River.
   Their separatist fight intensified last week after another
separatist group, the Gagauz minority in the southern corner of the
republic, declared autonomy and began holding elections for an
independent government.
   Groups of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians reportedly helped
defend the Gagauz against brigades of Moldavian nationalists trying
to stop the secession drives. Both groups have accused Moldavians
of discriminating against the minorities during Moldavia's own
independence drive from the Soviet Union.
   The Kremlin sent 500 to 800 Interior Ministry troops to the
Gagauz region to keep order last week.
   Today's violence came hours after the Moldavian Supreme Soviet
legislature declared a state of emergency in Dubossary and the
nearby towns of Tiraspol and Bendery. It had imposed similar rules
on the Gagauz area last week.
   The legislature also voted to form a new Moldavian national
guard, separate from the national Interior Ministry troops and its
regiments based in Moldavia.
   Tass said the emergency rules were expanded following reports
that ``armed units'' were approached the cities from Kishniev,
Parajan said. He did not say who made up the units, Tass reported.
   Parajan told Tass Dubossary residents were preparing to protect
their city. He said people were blocking bridges over the Dniester
but gave no details.
   ``We demand the introduction of Soviet Interior Ministry troops,
instead of Kishniev militia or volunteer units,'' Tass quoted
Parajan as saying.
   Gagauz representatives have been negotiating with a joint
Moldavian-Soviet committee trying to resolve the standoff in the
Gagauz districts. Both sides agreed to pull back their defenders,
mostly youths reportedly armed with sticks and metal rods, and to
allow the security forces to establish a buffer.
   There had been no reports of violence since Wednesday, when
Moldavians attacked the frontier with Romania, threatening to kill
guards and their families unless Soviet forces withdraw. The
militants gave up and no casualties were reported.
   Tass said today that the situation in the Gagauz areas has
nearly returned to normal, with Interior Ministry troops remaining
at the border but now letting people pass through.
   ``Industrial enterprises, offices and schools are working
normally. Road blocks have been removed...,'' Tass reported.

<HEAD>Only Herself To Blame For Stunning Defeat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
suffered a stunning defeat at the ballot box because she didn't do
her homework, not because of large-scale vote tampering, analysts
say.
   Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning Pakistan People's Party was
outmaneuvered in the Oct. 24 parliamentary election by the Islamic
Democratic Alliance, a right-wing coalition backed by the people
who count in Pakistan - the army and the bureaucracy.
   For the 37-year-old former prime minister, the defeat was
humiliating.
   The People's Party and its three smaller allies won only 45
seats in the 217-member National Assembly, less than half the
number they controlled in the last legislature.
   Most observers and opinion polls predicted a close race. They
also were astounded by the magnitude of the victory.
   The energetic, charismatic former prime minister attracted huge
crowds throughout her campaign. But that didn't translate into
broad public support for her party or her former government, which
was dismissed Aug. 6 on charges of corruption and mismanagement.
   Ms. Bhutto blamed her defeat on large-scale vote fraud, a charge
dismissed by her opponents and three separate and independent teams
of observers.
   While many Pakistanis believe some rigging occurred, they doubt
it would have significantly altered the outcome. In the end, they
say, she still would have lost.
   Despite her repeated charges of ``an electoral coup d'etat,''
Ms. Bhutto and her party have yet to produce solid evidence to back
up their claims and haven't a clue how the balloting could have
been rigged without notice.
   The People's Party, founded in the late 1960s by Ms. Bhutto's
father, former Prime Minister Zulfikar li Bhutto, once represented
the most progressive political force in Pakistan.
   But Ms. Bhutto largely ignored the party machinery once she took
the oath in December 1988 as the first woman leader of a modern
Moslem nation. She failed to see the modern, well-organized force
moving into her path.
   Supporters say the party badly needs restructuring to challenge
the alliance, which is more in tune with the lower and middle
classes than the landowning families that have led Pakistan since
its creation in 1947.
   ``Enough mileage has been made out of the pro-poor image that
the party earned during the late 1960s,'' political analyst Khalid
Mahmud said. ``There is a need to put some substance in the hollow
rhetoric before the `have-nots' lose all patience and give the PPP
even bigger surprises.''
   Since her dismissal three months ago, Ms. Bhutto has proved
she's a tenacious fighter, and most analysts believe it's premature
to say the spell that she has held over Pakistan for more than a
decade has been broken.
   But critics and supporters alike say she will have to make
drastic changes in her outlook and style if she wants to salvage
her demoralized party.
   ``She must descend from the pedestal and pursue alliances that
could broaden her support base. She must set aside past arrogance
in dealing with the smaller parties, especially those who fought
along with the People's Party against dictatorship but were not
deemed fit to share the spoils of victory,'' Mahmud said.
   Ms. Bhutto still faces the most serious challenge of her
political career. Some of her opponents admit privately they are
making a concerted effort to force her out of politics.
   Seven charges of mismanagement and abuse of power are pending
against her before special one-judge tribunals, and conviction on
any one could bar her from political life for seven years.
   But even some of her right-wing opponents say that would be bad
for Pakistan. If country needs a stable government, they said, then
it also needs a strong opposition.

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday
visited refugees of the earthquake that struck Iran's northern
provinces last June, killing 40,000 people and leaving half a
million homeless.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
Rafsanjani called for ``more attention toward permanent
settlement'' of the homeless. The quake struck the country's
northern Gilan and Zanjan provinces, injuring 60,000 people.
   Authorities have said that freezing temperatures and heavy snows
expected within weeks make providing shelter urgent. Tehran radio
reported Thursday that so far only half the homeless refugees had
been provided shelter.
   Rafsanjani urged provincial authorities to speed up water and
power supplies, cut by the quake, and to rebuild roads as soon as
possible. Roads are the only means of transportation for the more
than 1,800 villages devastated by the quake.
   Gilan's governor-general, Ali Reza Tabesh, told Rafsanjani that
``roads and infra-structural installations had suffered enormous
damage,'' IRNA said.
   It reported him as saying that $30 million had been given to the
provinces to rebuild roads and bridges. He also said some 170,000
houses had been destroyed and that industrial damage in the areas
totalled about $179 million, the agency said.

<HEAD>The Longest Running Show on Broadway - Sardi's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The curtain went up and the theater crowd came
back for the reopening this week of Sardi's, the venerable
Manhattan restaurant that has been host to Broadway's stars and
stargazers since the days of Prohibition.
   If the new owner looks familiar, well, he was the old owner.
Sardi's is owned by a Sardi again - 75-year-old Vincent Sardi,
grandson of the man who founded the 44th Street eatery as a
speakeasy in 1921.
   Vincent had sold the restaurant and retired to Vermont four
years ago. The new owners ran into financial problems, and Sardi's
closed in July. Vincent, who still had a stake in the restaurant,
decided to come out of retirement and run it himself.
   ``It's basically the old Sardi's - you don't want to change it.
It worked before,'' said Sardi. ``I've been to these new places -
lavish, but very cold. They spend millions, and the places have no
personality.''
   Sardi's has multiple personalities - or at least caricatures of
them. Sketches of Broadway stars past and present still line the
walls at 234 W. 44th Street, where the restaurant sits opposite the
Shubert Theater.
   Since July, passersby were greeted at the front door by a sign
which promised, ``Very soon I will reopen Sardi's, The Longest
Running Show on Broadway. Vincent Sardi.''
   On Thursday night, he made good on that promise. It was like old
times at Sardi's - the after-theater crowd filled the place in an
opening night party for David Merrick's new show ``Oh, Kay!''
   ``All my old customers were here. It was wonderful,'' said
Sardi. ``But The Times didn't like the play.''
   It's not the first time that's happened at Sardi's, which was
once a place for the city's elite to see and be seen. John
Barrymore, Helen Hayes and Rex Harrison were among those who
frequented the restaurant in the days when the paparazzi monitored
the front door nightly.
   ``If you don't see at least a dozen of the celebrities
caricatured on Sardi's walls, it means there's been a strike at
Actor's Equity,'' advised the book ``New York on $1,000 A Day.''
   Food was not the attraction, as critic Mimi Sheraton made clear
in this 1982 review:
   ``Those who go to the restaurant to observe celebrities will
rarely be disappointed. Those that go for good food that is well
served will rarely be satisfied. For reasons that remain a mystery,
food, service and housekeeping at Sardi's leave almost everything
to be desired.''
   People still packed the place.
   While aiming to create the old ambiance, Sardi did spruce things
up. He sunk $500,000 into improvements: new carpet, new paint,
reupholstered banquettes.
   Things were allowed to run down by the previous owners, who ran
into financial problems, Sardi said.
   The restaurant opened to the general public Friday, with a
healthy lunch crowd and a good number of dinner reservations. Sardi
is aware it's a rough market these days, but he's hoping to restore
his restaurant to its past glories.
   ``It's going to be tough. But the name was not tarnished. We had
a terrific following, and I hope they'll be back,'' said Sardi.
``We're happy to be back. It's going to be big time.''

<HEAD>Palestinians Strike to Mark Balfour Declaration Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>

   Palestinians staged a general strike Friday to
protest Zionism's first major victory 73 years ago, the Balfour
Declaration which offered Britain's support for a Jewish homeland
in Palestine.
   Israeli officials, meanwhile, defended Israel's treatment of
Palestinians following criticism by U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar. But some opposition figures also expressed fears
Israel was becoming more isolated from the world community.
   The strike, called by the fundamentalist movement Hamas, or
Zeal, closed shops and halted most public transport in Arab east
Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In Jerusalem, police blocked Palestinians from the territories
for a fourth week from entering the walled Old City to attend the
main Moslem weekly prayers at the Al Aqsa mosque.
   Officials maintain the step is needed to prevent a repetition of
the Oct. 8 riots on the Temple Mount that led to the death of 20
Palestinians in Israeli gunfire and subsequent condemnation of
Israel by the U.N. Security Council.
   At Al Aqsa, Moslem preacher Mohammed Hussein recalled the
Balfour Declaration of Nov. 2, 1917, which conditioned Britain's
support of a Jewish homeland on the idea that the civil and
religious rights of non-Jews would not be harmed.
   ``We have been deprived of our national rights and now there is
no freedom to worship in our own mosque,'' Hussein told several
thousand worshipers.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded eight Palestinians,
including four who were hit when troops opened fire on stone
throwers after noon prayers in Gaza City, Arab reporters said.
   In reaction to the latest U.N. criticism of Israel, a spokesman
for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir maintained that Israel was
``doing everything'' to ensure the security of the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   ``If there is any lack of security it derives from the violent
activities of the Arabs against Israelis and their own brethren,''
spokesman Yossi Ahimeir told the daily Davar.
   Shamir, in an interview for his 75th birthday in the Yedioth
Ahronoth, defended his rejection of a Security Council resolution
urging a U.N. investigation of the Temple Mount deaths.
   ``Is is the intervention of the U.N. in Jerusalem. I don't care
what they want to investigate. ... The wording of the Security
Council resolution harms our security in Jerusalem,'' he said.
   Israel annexed Arab east Jerusalem after seizing the area in the
1967 Middle East war. Most Western nations, including the United
States, do not recognize Israeli sovereignty there.
   Other officials seemed hesitant to react to Perez de Cuellar's
suggestion for an international conference how to protect the
Palestinians. The Foreign Ministry scheduled a briefing on the
latest U.N. actions, then canceled it after reporters had been
waiting for almost an hour.
   The daily Haaretz quoted unnamed diplomats as saying they feared
further Israeli rejection of U.N. moves on Palestinians would erode
Israel's support in the world community.
   Micha Harish, general secretary of the opposition Labor Party,
issued a statement rejecting Perez de Cuellar's suggestion but
criticizing Shamir for refusing a U.N. investigation of the Temple
Mount deaths.
   ``Shamir is creating unnecessary conficts with the president of
the United States and the rest of the nations of the world,'' he
said.
   Perez de Cuellar made the suggestion of calling a meeting of
signatory states to the 1949 Geneva Conventions in an 11-page
report compiled by the Security Council after the Oct. 8 killings.
   He said the meeting should consider ways to protect Palestinians
since U.N. pleas for Israel to abide by the Conventions on
treatment of occupied people had been ``ineffective.''
   Israel's U.N. mission rejected the comments as interference,
saying Israel has sole control of the occupied territories.
   Israel maintains the Geneva Conventions do not apply in the West
Bank and Gaza, but that it follows the conventions' humanitarian
provisions.
   However, Israel regularly uses punishments forbidden by the
conventions, such as deportations and demolition of Palestinian
homes. The argument is that these actions have been deemed legal by
the Israeli Supreme Court.

   President Bush said today he would
strive to bring U.S. forces home from the Persian Gulf ``without a
shot being fired in anger.'' The White House said the president
would visit the troops on Thanksgiving.
   Bush will travel to Saudi Arabia, also stopping in Egypt, after
a trip to Paris for the Nov. 19-21 Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said. Bush planned to share Thanksgiving dinner with a few of the
230,000 Americans deployed in the region.
   Before the announcement of Bush's Persian Gulf trip, the
president campaigned for Republican candidates in Ohio. In
Cincinnati, he mixed themes of war, peace and politics, promising
to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.
   Bush told a GOP rally: ``Saddam Hussein must get out, and he
must get out totally, and the legitimate rulers must be returned.''
   It was the fourth day in a row that Bush has sought to press his
verbal barrage against the Iraqi leader.
   But Bush said he had no apologizes for raising the subject at
one political rally after another as he seeks to provide
last-minute help for GOP candidates in next Tuesday's midterm
elections.
   ``I'll repeat it today, I'll repeat it tomorrow and I'll repeat
it the next day,'' Bush declared.
   Earlier, Bush had urged American hostage families to ignore
Saddam's invitation to visit loved ones in captivity, calling it a
brutal ``ploy.''
   ``I think those people should come home to visit with their
families. I think they should be released from captivity,'' Bush
said Thursday. He suggested the Iraqi leader had surpassed even
Adolf Hitler in some forms of brutality.
   Today, Bush told his Ohio audience:
   ``Let me be very clear. There cannot be any compromise'' short
of total Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Praising the more than 220,000 U.S. troops now stationed in the
Persian Gulf region, Bush said: ``I'll do my level best to bring
every single one of them home without a shot being fired in anger.
But we will not stop short of our stated objectives.
   ``We are the United States of America. We are standing for
principle. And that principle must prevail.''
   ``Brutality against innocent civilians will not be tolerated and
will not stand,'' he said. ``It is inhumane, it is wrong and it
must not be rewarded.''
   ``Shift gears with me,'' Bush told his Ohio audience as he moved
from traditional partisan attacks on Democrats to what has become
his daily diatribe against the Iraqi leader.
   ``Our nation is together in our determination that Saddam
Hussein's aggression will not stand,'' he said.
   The president appeared at a $50-a-person fund-raising breakfast
and at a separate $2,000-a-couple private reception in an effort to
help raise last-minute funds for Ohio Republicans in two close
races.
   Republican George Voinovich, the former mayor of Cleveland, is
in a hard-fought battle against Democratic state attorney general
Anthony Celebrezze in the gubernatorial race. Black Republican J.
Kenneth Blackwell is in a tight contest against Charles Luken, the
son of retiring incumbent Rep. Tom Luken, for the senior Luken's
House seat.
   Bush, in a nonstop campaign swing for Republican candidates that
will end on Election Day, was to speak later today at GOP rallies
in Rochester, Minn., and Sioux City, Iowa, before flying on to
California to the night.
   Several hundred protesters gathered in a square outside the
Cincinnati hotel where Bush was speaking, bearing signs protesting
U.S. Gulf policy, including, ``Fund Education, Not War.''
   ``I can share their concern,'' Bush said, noting the
demonstrators in his remarks. But, he said ``We are talking about
brutal, naked aggression. We are talking about one country bullying
a neighbor.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Steps up Honecker Probe, Official Demands Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said Friday they had stepped up their
probe of Erich Honecker, while a top official in Bonn demanded a
trial and conviction of the former East German Communist leader.
   Honecker is confined to a Soviet military hospital outside
Berlin, while German officials wrestle with his fate.
   Prosecutors are trying to decide whether there is enough
evidence to charge him with corruption and murder for the
shoot-to-kill orders aimed at would-be escapees. About 200 people
were killed trying to flee from East Germany's hard-line regime.
   In an interview published in the weekly newspaper The European,
Honecker was quoted as boldly predicting he ``will be seen to have
been right'' in his leadership of the country.
   ``I am not afraid of a show trial. I consider all the charges so
far brought by the prosecutor's office untenable,'' the 78-year-old
Honecker added.
   That caused immediate criticism in Bonn.
   Legislator Wolfgang Boetsch said the interview showed Honecker
was demonstrating his ``mockery of the people and cynicism.''
   ``Whoever is ready for interviews should also be ready to stand
before justice to see whether he is guilty,'' the member of the
conservative Christian Social Union told reporters.
   Honecker, deposed a little more than a year ago, reportedly had
been in ill health. But pictures taken shortly before the Oct. 3
reunification of Germany showed him looking fit and energetically
walking through the woods near the hospital.
   Berlin prosecutors said on Oct. 19 that a lack of manpower had
prevented them from making progress in their investigation of him,
sparking skepticism at a crowded news conference.
   However, prosecutors' spokesman Cornel Christoffel said things
had changed in the last two weeks.
   ``They are concentrating the investigation on Mielke and
Honecker,'' Christoffel said of the five-member team. Erich Mielke,
the former secret police boss, is already in jail awaiting trial.
   Christoffel said the team will have to pore through 400 file
folders in Honecker's case before deciding whether to arrest him or
bring him to court.
   The spokesman said Honecker's case was of top importance
``because of his prominent position within the Communist Party.''
   While the prosecutor's office maintains its staunch
independence, there appeared to be growing pressure to bring
Honecker to justice.
   The No. 2 official in the Inner-German Relations Ministry said
Honecker must be ``convicted for reasons of political health,
morality and atonement for the most serious human rights
violations.''
   In addition to the shoot-to-kill orders, State Secretary
Ottfried Hennig also listed what he said was Honecker's
responsibility for 300,000 politically motivated convictions.
   ``Whether he can be put in prison afterwards is a decision that
is exclusively up to the doctors,'' Hennig told the Berlin
newspaper Neue Zeit.
   Despite the pressure to bring Honecker to trial, there are some
Germans who feel that it would be better to leave him alone rather
than facing a heavily publicized courtroom drama.

   Police in Michigan and Iowa were
searching Friday for a man suspected of killing the mother of his
ex-girlfriend and then abducting the young woman, their two
children and the woman's sister.
   Terry Lee Janssen, 25, was at large Friday afternoon with
21-year-old Shannon Pallas, who officials believe is being held
against her will, said Berrien County Prosecutor Dennis Wiley.
   Janssen is believed to be armed, he said. Relatives said Janssen
drove a truck for a living.
   The children, ages 1 and 2, and Pallas' 14-year-old sister were
dropped off unharmed early Friday at the home of Janssen's mother
in Waterloo, Iowa, Wiley said.
   The body of Pallas' mother, Sharon Limas, 47, was found Thursday
night in her Lake Township home in the southwestern tip of
Michigan. Investigators said she apparently was killed by a shotgun
blast.
   Pallas and the three other family members lived at the home and
apparently were abducted after the slaying and driven to Waterloo
by the suspect, police said.

   What's being called the world's
largest crane, designed for a project that would have supplied
major cities with electricity from floating nuclear power plants,
has been sold to China.
   Workers from the China State Shipbuilding Corp. are dismantling
the crane at Blount Island - along the St. John's River - for
shipment by Christmas to a port on the Yellow Sea.
   The Chinese reportedly paid $3 million for the 38-story crane,
which cost about $15 million when it was built for Offshore Power
Systems, owned by Westinghouse Inc. and Tenneco Inc.
   The first plant was to have been launched in 1979, and nine more
were to follow.
   The project was abandoned in the early 1980s, partly because of
fears fueled by the accident at a nuclear plant on Three Mile
Island in Pennsylvania.

<TEXT>
   Fifty-three Soviet soldiers have applied
for asylum in Germany since the end of August, the Interior
Ministry said Friday.
   It is widely believed that dozens of other Red Army soldiers
have deserted and are hiding out in what was East Germany before
unification of the Germanys on Oct. 3.
   Moscow has agreed to withdraw its 380,000 troops based in what
was East Germany by 1994, but the returning Soviet soldiers will
face bleak housing and economic conditions in their homeland.
   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Hesse state, Christian
Jaletzke, said 32 of the latest asylum applications were being
handled in Hesse.
   Jaletzke also said the wife and two children of a Soviet major
who is seeking asylum had been given permission to remain in
Germany.
   He said the major had returned to the Soviet Union to apply for
a discharge, and was expected to join his family when he gained his
release from the military.
   Jaletzke did not identify the family by name but said they were
of Jewish descent. Soviet Jews have been leaving in large numbers
because of freer emigration policies and fears of rising
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.

take him to Europe, the White House said today.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush will have his
Thanksgiving dinner with some of the 210,000 U.S. servicemen and
women assembled in the gulf following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Bush will travel to Saudi Arabia after a trip to Paris for the

   Following the Paris summit, Bush will travel to the gulf,
stopping in Egypt and Saudi Arabia for talks Saudi Arabian King
Fahd, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and the exiled emir of
Kuwait.
   Bush will leave Nov. 16 and return to Washington Nov. 23.
   Bush will stop first in Prague on Nov. 17 to help celebrate
Czechoslovakia's turn to democracy, and will meet there with
President Vaclav Havel.
   On Nov. 18, he will continue on to Ludwigshafen, Germany, to
meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl at his residence, before going to
Paris for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Plans are to complete an agreement for conventional arms
reduction at the conference of the 34-nation organization.

<HEAD>US Team To Head For Israel To Complete Deal on Soviet Housing
Funds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James Baker III said Friday
that a U.S. team would leave for Israel soon to finalize the
transfer of $400 million in housing guarantees for Soviet Jews,
officials said.
   The decision to send the team - conveyed by Baker to Israel's
new ambassador, Zalman Shoval - ends a prolonged dispute which
contributed to already strained relations between the two
countries.
   The dispute concerned U.S. demands that Israel not use the
guarantees to build homes in the predominantly Arab part of
Jerusalem, which the Israelis captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war.
   Shoval made clear that although Israel would not use U.S. money
to build homes in the eastern part of Jerusalem, it would use its
own money to build wherever it wanted.
   ``There are no two cities of Jerusalem, just as there are no two
cities of Berlin,'' Shoval told reporters.
   Israel's Arab neighbors are incensed at the growing number of
Jewish homes being built in what they regard as occupied territory.
Israel annexed the land in 1967, but only a handful of countries
recognize the move.
   The Bush administration has raised Israel's hackles several
times in recent months by questioning Israel's right to the eastern
part of the city - an explosive issue that the Reagan
administration had refrained from raising.
   But the question arose this year partly as a result of the
rising tide of Soviet Jews being allowed to leave for Israel under
the newly liberalized emigration policies of President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   After months of negotiations, Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy wrote Baker on Oct. 2 agreeing that the U.S. housing
guarantees would be used only to build homes for immigrants on
lands Israel controlled before 1967.
   But several members of the Israeli government, including
hardliners such as Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, then backed off
Levy's promise, prompting fresh U.S. doubts.
   Israel was then asked to reassure the United States, which
Shoval did in messages to the State Department earlier this week.
   This paved the way for Baker to instruct the team of experts
from the Agency for International Development to leave for Israel.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the group
would leave soon, although the date was not yet fixed.
   Shoval said the $400 million will only guarantee 5,000-7,000
housing units, whereas Israel will need to build some 250,000 homes
in the next four to six years for the Soviet immigrants.
   Israel will have to raise $20 billion to $30 billion dollars
over the next few years to absorb as many as two million Soviet
Jews expected over the next seven to eight years, he said.
   Relations between Israel and the United States have been
severely strained since the start of the Persian Gulf crisis. The
United States has twice voted against Israel at the United Nations
in connection with the killing of 21 Palestinians on Jerusalem's
Temple Mount during an Oct. 8 riot.
   President Bush has sent Israeli Prime Minister three letters in
the past 10 days regarding Israel's refusal to accept a U.N.
investigation of the killings, officials said. Shamir has rejected
Bush's request that Israel accept the team.
   Nonetheless, Shoval described the tone of Bush's letters as
``cordial and warm.'' Bush even sent Shamir a third letter Friday,
he said, congratulating him on his 75th birthday.

<HEAD>Helms: Deal Struck To Build Oregon Inlet Jetties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Next week's election has nothing to do with
the timing of the announcement that long-awaited jetties will be
built in the treacherous Oregon Inlet, Sen. Jesse Helms said.
   The announcement came Thursday, almost a week after a storm
tossed a dredge through the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, knocking out
a 370-foot section and isolating Hatteras Island.
   Helms and Gov. Jim Martin said it was that accident, not
political motives, that led opponents to reach an agreement on the
jetties.
   ``That got their attention,'' Helms said, speaking of several
federal agencies involved in the issue. ``I think it brought them
together and they agreed, for the first time, something needed to
be done and should have een done earlier.''
   On Thursday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
presented a $2.5 million check to state Secretary of Transportation
Tommy Harrelson to go toward rebuilding the bridge's missing
segment. Skinner said the check represents the federal government's
80 percent share of the repair costs.
   The presentation was made during a campaign news conference
called by Helms in Greensboro. Helms, a three-term Republican
senator, is in a close re-election race in Tuesday's election
against Democrat Harvey Gantt.
   A letter Helms carried to the news conference from U.S. Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said permits for the construction of the
jetties would be forthcoming in six to eight months.
   ``The jetties will save the fishing industry of North Carolina
in that area,'' Helms said.
   Commercial fishing boats use Oregon Inlet to travel between the
Atlantic Ocean and a seafood processing center in Wanchese.
   Twenty-six people have been killed in accidents in the inlet
during the last 26 years, Martin said. The jetties are designed to
prevent the inlet from becoming clogged with sand.
   Fishermen, environmentalists and politicians have fought for two
decades over the jetties.
   Environmentalists fear the jetties would cause erosion of nearby
Outer Banks beaches in the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and the
Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge.
   The jetties agreement came after the Army Corps of Engineers
said it would give the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
National Park Service, which control land access on both the north
and south sides of Oregon Inlet, a voice in the project's design,
Helms said.
   Earlier estimates were that the jetties would cost $115 million,
Helms said. But changes that make the design more environmentally
sound also bring down the cost to $84 million, he said.
   Preliminary plans call for one-mile stone jetties to be built on
each side of the inlet between Bodie and Hatteras islands on Dare
County's Outer Banks.
   Still, the jetties have some opponents.
   A Duke University marine geology professor, Orrin Pilkey, said
the jetties will cause even more erosion on the Outer Banks.
   ``In the next few years, we should see severe erosion
downstream, which is already happening,'' Pilkey said. ``Highway 12
is on the brink of being lost with every storm.''

<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's supporters on Friday rejected appeals to boycott
Parliament and grudgingly agreed to take their oaths.
   Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party suffered a
stunning defeat in the Oct. 24 national elections that brought a
right-wing coalition to power.
   She has accused her opponents of massive vote fraud, although
the claims have yet to be substantiated.
   Her fellow party members' decision to take their seats Saturday
on the opposition bench in the National Assembly gave Ms. Bhutto's
husband, Asif Ali Zardari, a brief taste of freedom after 23 days
in jail on kidnapping and extortion charges.
   Zardari was elected to the federal legislature from the Lyari
slum in the southern port city of Karachi. He was to be flown to
the capital under armed escort early Saturday to take his
parliamentary oath.
   Zardari, 38, has been blamed for much of Ms. Bhutto's troubles
since her government was ousted Aug. 6 on corruption charges. He
came under regular fire during her 20 months in power for allegedly
demanding commissions on lucrative government contracts. He has
steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.
   The conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance, a loose-knit
coalition of 18 parties united only in their contempt for Ms.
Bhutto, will form Pakistan's fifth civilian government in 43 years.
   Nawaz Sharif, 41, will be the next prime minister. He was the
alliance's unanimous choice for the post, which will be decided by
secret ballot in the National Assembly, the policy-making lower
house of Parliament. However, the vote is merely a formality.
   ``It's a distorted democracy, but it's better than nothing,''
said Iftikar Gilaini, a former law minister in Ms. Bhutto's
Cabinet.
   Sharif's alliance swept the polls, winning 105 seats in the
217-seat Assembly. He also claims the loyalty of another 40 seats
controlled by independents and smaller parties. Ms. Bhutto's
People's Party and three allied groups won only 45 seats.
   ``We have to work to defeat them from within and from without,''
Gilaini said during a meeting of party members Friday.
   The 37-year-old former prime minister called the meeting to plot
a strategy to protest election results, which included possibly
boycotting the National Assembly.
   The more militant party workers favored either a boycott or
street demonstrations to force new elections in at least 100
constituencies where they allege mass rigging occurred.
   ``It's too late now for street demonstrations,'' said one party
worker, who refused to be identified. ``The momentum is lost.''
   National elections were called three years early after President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan used his constitutional powers to dismiss Ms.
Bhutto's government. Ishaq Khan accused her government of
widespread corruption, ineptitude and confrontational politics.

   A drug overdose left Marlon Brando's
daughter, Cheyenne, in a coma at a hospital in Tahiti, the actor's
lawyer said today.
   ``There should be some news today on whether she's going to make
it,'' said Robert L. Shapiro, who represents Miss Brando's brother,
Christian, on murder charges in the shooting death of her
26-year-old Tahitian lover, Dag Drollet.
   Marlon Brando was leaving for Tahiti to be with his daughter,
Shapiro said. Ms. Brando was charged by French authorities in
Tahiti as an accessory to Drollet's murder, and was not allowed to
leave the island.
   Shapiro said he expected Christian Brando's trial to begin with
jury selection as scheduled on Monday.
   ``He's very depressed by this, exceedingly depressed. What else
can happen?'' Shapiro said of the 32-year-old defendant. ``It just
is a continuing chain of horrible events for both the Brandos and
the Drollets.''
   Ms. Brando overdosed on tranquilizers and antidepressant drugs,
he said.
   After the May 16 shooting of Drollet at the Brando compound in
Los Angeles, Ms. Brando fled to Tahiti, where she recently gave
birth to Drollet's child.
   Prosecutors in Los Angeles want Ms. Brando to testify at her
half-brother's trial.
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday referred to an appeals court
a prosecution request to delay the trial pending the outcome of
efforts to bring Ms. Brando to Los Angeles.
   Deputy District Attorneys Steven Barshop and William Clark said
today they would have no comment on the new developments. Clark
said he also expected jury selection to start Monday.
   Shapiro has stated in court that Ms. Brando had a drug problem.
Before she left the United States, he said she ingested cleanser.
   A physician at Mamao Hospital today confirmed Ms. Brando, 20,
was at the Tahitian facility.
   ``I can't say anything further without the authorization of the
family,'' he said. ``She's hospitalized. That's all I can say.''
   Meanwhile, Clark confirmed a report that Ms. Brando once gave a
statement implicating her father in the slaying of her lover.
Shapiro said it was one of five conflicting statements given by Ms.
Brando and she eventually recanted it.
   ``I accused in front of his lawyers, my father of complicity in
the murder of Dag, because I thought he was fixated with the
`Godfather' and that he was crazy on the subject,'' Ms. Brando
said, according to the syndicated television program ``Hard Copy,''
which said it obtained a copy of her deposition to a Tahitian
court.
   ``He was jealous of my life and my happiness and he always
wanted me to take care of him,'' the young woman said. ``However, I
must tell you that I retracted my accusation of complicity that I
made at the moment of Dag's death because I was traumatized.''
   In the statement, Cheyenne Brando told the judge: ``Your honor,
you must see this film (`Godfather'). You will understand
everything.''
   Clark confirmed other statements from Ms. Brando's deposition,
including her account of moments after the shooting.
   ``He (Christian) told me, `It's done. I have killed him,'' Ms.
Brando said. ``He told me that it was necessary that I lie by
saying, that I must say that he was fighting with Dag and that the
shot was the only shot.''
   Shapiro said Ms. Brando ``clearly is suffering from serious
mental and emotional problems.'' He said she gave authorities five
different accounts of the shooting ``all varying in degrees and
varying in people's involvement.''
   At one point, he said Ms. Brando implicated ``a person who has
not been mentioned at all as being the cause of the death of Dag.''
He declined to identify the person.
   Marlon Brando said his daughter has had emotional problems since
Drollet died. The last time he accompanied his son to court he
burst into tears when asked about his daughter's condition.

<TEXT>
   Baseball's Giants moved here 33 years ago
because New York wouldn't build a ballpark, and the team will be on
the road south to Santa Clara County if voters there agree Tuesday
to pay for a new stadium.
   The team has been unhappy with cold, windblown Candlestick Park
near downtown San Francisco, but the city's voters have rejected
proposals to build a new stadium.
   Leaders in five cities in Santa Clara County 40 miles to the
south stepped in with a plan to finance a stadium for the Giants by
raising utility taxes. Voters in those communities are faced with a
complex web of ballot questions, all of which must pass for the
stadium to get the go-ahead.
   ``If they build it we will come, no question,'' said Corey
Busch, vice president of the Giants, which would be renamed the
Santa Clara Giants. ``We have never been happy with Candlestick.
And neither have the fans.''
   Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has lent his support to the
plan. He has said the Santa Clara Giants ``has a nice ring to it,''
and the proposal would keep the team in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Voters in the five cities are being asked to approve a 1 percent
utility tax to finance the proposed $153 million stadium.
   Measure G is the utility tax question on the ballots in Santa
Clara, San Jose, Sunnyvale and Milpitas. If approved, the tax would
raise about $16 million a year.
   Those cities have agreed to become members of a Joint Powers
Authority that would operate the stadium. The city of Mountain View
would become a member only if its voters approved a separate
utility tax, Measure O.
   Even if those measures pass, voters in San Jose and Santa Clara
also must approve two closely related measures.
   San Jose residents will decide whether to allow the city to
participate in building a sports facility. If Measure H doesn't
pass, nearly half the utility tax proceeds would be lost -
essentially killing the deal.
   Santa Clara voters will decide whether to allow use of 98 acres
of city-owned land for the stadium.
   ``It's a very complicated set of ballot issues, which will make
it tough for some voters to follow,'' said Art Troyer, a Santa
Clara County official who would become the interim director of the
stadium authority. ``We think it's going to be a close vote for
that reason and because people just don't want to pay more taxes
for anything.''
   The proposed utility tax would cost the average resident $16 to
$18 a year for 12 to 14 years until stadium profits began to repay
construction bonds.
   The Giants' lease at the 64,000-seat Candlestick Park expires in
1992, and the team hopes to occupy the proposed 45,000-seat Santa
Clara stadium for the 1994 season.
   Giants owner Bob Lurie has said since the early 1980s that he
wanted to leave Candlestick, which has narrow aisles, bad weather
and parking and access problems.
   San Francisco leaders tried unsuccessfully to get voters to
approve a new downtown stadium, most recently last year.
   ``We have no choice but to look for another home, especially
with the rising costs and players salaries,'' Busch said. ``The
franchise cannot survive in Candlestick Park. ... And if Santa
Clara doesn't build us a stadium, we'll go somewhere else.''

   Police used steel-tipped truncheons
Friday to disperse about 2,000 Moslems protesting religious
violence and deaths in Hindu-dominated India.
   Anti-Hindu riots earlier this week across predominately Islamic
Bangladesh killed at least three people and injured more than 350,
according to officials and news reports. Hospital officials said
two of the victims died Friday of gunshot wounds.
   In India, more than 275 people have died since Oct. 24 when
fundamentalist Hindus began efforts to raze a mosque and build a
Hindu temple on the site.
   Hindus say the 460-year-old Babri Mosque was built on the
foundation of an early Hindu temple marking the birthplace of the
warrior god Rama. Moslems dispute the history.
   At least two of the victims in Bangladesh were Moslems and the
religion of the third has not been identified. All suffered bullet
wounds, but it was not clear who fired the shots.
   Anupam Sen, a Hindu leader, claimed 1,276 Hindu temples were
damaged and 10,000 Hindus lost their shops or homes in the riots.
   The march Friday began outside the Baitul Mosque, the largest in
Dhaka. Witnesses said police appealed to the crowd to disperse
before moving in with truncheons. There were no immediate reports
of injuries.
   Curfews in Dhaka and the southern port of Chittagong were
briefly lifted for Moslem sabbath prayers.
   The unrest began in Chittagong on Tuesday night following
reports that Hindus tried to seize the mosque in Ayodhya, India,
300 miles southeast of New Delhi. At least 10 people died Friday in
a second attempt to storm the site.
   Police used steel-tipped batons to disperse 400 Moslems who
tried to break into a Hindu temple in Barisal, 75 miles south of
Dhaka, said Dainik Bangla, a government-owned daily newspaper. At
least 50 people were injured.
   Dhaka riot police armed with tear-gas guns and truncheons
wounded about 100 people who tried to ``vandalize and loot
Hindu-owned shops and temples,'' said Ittefaq, an independent
Bengali-language daily.
   In Chittagong, the country's second-largest city, 500 Moslems
attacked a Hindu village with knives and homemade bombs Thursday
night, witnesses said.
   Bangladesh's 110 million people are 88 percent Moslem, and 10
percent Hindus.
   On Thursday, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad called out the
army in Dhaka and ordered security forces to take ``tough action
against the forces who are trying to disrupt peace and harmony.''
He visited a Hindu temple in Dhaka, which was vandalized by Moslem
gangs.

   What price fame? How about $714 for a blue
silk scarf owned by Madonna?
   The price was right for Moses Findley, who placed the winning
bid at an auction for the silk scarf that went with a $20,000
blue-sequined dress owned by Madonna, a Michigan native.
   It was worn by the singer during the filming of her video,
``True Blue.''
   The ensemble was stolen two years ago from an MTV display at
Twelve Oaks Mall in this hamlet about 15 miles northwest of
Detroit. The dress was returned by attempts to send back the scarf
were unsuccessful, police said.
   By Thursday, 10 bids came in to the Novi Police Department,
mostly from metropolitan Detroit, but one came from Chicago and one
from Los Angeles.
   ``I never dreamed that I would be the high bidder on this,''
said Findley, of Southfield. ``I'm just ecstatic about it.''
   Findley, 39, said he will auction off the scarf this month and
hopes it will bring bids of thousands of dollars that he will
donate to the Pontiac Rescue Mission and several Detroit agencies
that aid the homeless.
   The money from the police auction will go to the Novi Drug Abuse
Resistance Education program.

<HEAD>Man Who Killed Teen-Ager Reaches Plea Agreement With Prosecutor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who fatally shot a teen-ager reached a
plea agreement under which he can avoid jail, fines, and a criminal
record.
   District Attorney David Moss appeared Thursday at a news
conference with the defendant, Bobby Wayne Hale.
   Moss, who is seeking re-election Tuesday, said he had received
petitions signed by thousands of people asking that he not
prosecute Hale.
   ``Not for one minute have I been allowed to forget that I have
an election next week,'' Moss said.
   Under the agreement, Hale pleaded no contest to second-degree
manslaughter and received a six-month deferred sentence.
   Police said Hale fatally shot Jesse Elmer Jones as the
16-year-old was driving away from the home of Hale's daughter on
Oct. 16. The woman's home had recently been burglarized.
   ``The situation escalated into something that I had no control
over,'' Hale said. ``How something so unintentional can go so
wrong, I don't have the answer for it.''
   Moss said he believed Hale should be treated with a gentle hand
because he had been ``a law-abiding, contributing member of the
community.''
   Tulsa Special Judge Pete Messler, who approved the plea, said
the case will be dismissed May 1 if Hale stays out of trouble.
   Moss said the shooting shouldn't be excused.
   ``Before you shoot somebody, you or whoever you are defending
has to be in imminent danger of death or bodily injury,'' Moss
said. ``The rule of law must prevail.''
   But he said he understood the community's growing frustration
with juvenile crime.
   Attorney Jeff Fischer, who represents Jones' mother, said the
family believed prosecuting Hale ``would not further the interests
of the criminal justice system.''

<HEAD>Radical Students Clash with Police in Anti-Government Protests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students demanding the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo clashed with police Friday,
while factional strife that has threatened to split the governing
party showed signs of easing.
   Clashes erupted at 15 colleges and universities in Seoul, where
bands of 300 to 500 students fought police with rocks and firebombs
to mark the 60th anniversary on Saturday of a 1930 student uprising
against Japanese colonial rule.
   Police fired tear gas to block students from marching into the
streets following the anti-government rallies. The total number of
students involved in Friday's protests was estimated at 5,000.
   There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.
   The students oppose calls within Roh's party for a
constitutional revision that would replace the country's
presidential system of government with a parliamentary one headed
by a prime minister.
   Urging one another to emulate the 1930 uprising, students at
Yonsei University chanted: ``Let's inherit the fighting spirit of
our seniors and punish Roh Tae-woo!''
   Meanwhile, mainstream groups within the governing party
indicated Friday they would withdraw their demands for a new form
of government and seek to end the factional strife threatening
Roh's leadership.
   ``It has become apparent that a constitutional revision for a
parliamentary form of government is realistically impossible,''
said a senior governing party official close to Roh, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   His statement came after a minority faction of about 50
legislators threatened to break away from the governing Democratic
Liberal Party.
   Rep. Kim Dong-young, a spokesman for the minority faction,
expressed optimism Friday that the dispute could be resolved by the
weekend.
   The infighting is basically a power struggle to determine which
faction within the governing party will name the next presidential
candidate in elections scheduled for 1992.
   Roh's group, which controls more seats in parliament and has no
clear presidential candidate, prefers a parliamentary system
because it would be better represented.
   A crisis within the party erupted last week when Seoul
newspapers printed a memorandum showing a secret agreement between
opposing factions to press for a parliamentary government.
   It was the worst political crisis since early this year when Roh
joined two opposition leaders in forming a new governing coalition
that controls more than two-thirds of seats in the 299-member
National Assembly.
   The memo, signed by Roh and two former opposition leaders, Kim
Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, called for a parliamentary system by
next year.
   Roh and Kim Jong-pil, a former prime minister, had been allied
against Kim Young-sam, who as party chairman has the No. 2 post
after Roh.
   The disclosure of the secret memo was especially damaging for
Kim Young-sam, who has repeatedly vowed to fight attempts to change
the system of government.
   Since the disclosure, Kim Young-sam has admitted to signing the
memo but said he now realizes it is impossible to change the system
of government without consent from the opposition camp.
   Kim controls 50 of the 218 governing party seats, enough votes
to block any constitutional revision in parliament.
   A constitutional revision requires approval by two-thirds of
lawmakers before being referred to a national referendum.

   With the onset of cooler weather in the
Persian Gulf, U.S. officials have been trying unsuccessfully for
Iraqi cooperation in supplying clothing and blankets to American
hostages, the State Department said Friday.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said officials assume that most of
the more than 100 detained Americans are ill-equipped to cope with
dropping nighttime temperatures, now dipping to the 50s.
   ``We would be willing to provide the clothing and blankets if we
knew that the supplies would go to the people that are being
held,'' she said.
   So far, she added, the Iraqi government hasn't been willing to
guarantee that any supplies the United States provides would
actually get to the hostages.
   Officials believe the condition of the detained hostages has
been deteriorating. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Monday that some have been forced to sleep on ``vermin-ridden
concrete floors.''
   About 105 hostages are in detention, most at military and
industrial sites to deter a potential U.S. military attack.
Slightly fewer than 1,000 Americans are believed to be in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   On a related subject, Ms. Tutwiler said the administration has
learned that representatives of the Iraqi government are inviting
members of hostage families and prominent American citizens to
visit Iraq.
   ``Iraq is cruelly dangling as the lure for these visits the
possibility of obtaining the release of or having the chance to
visit hostages held against international law,'' she said.
   ``Saddam Hussein is using Americans and othe nationals as pawns
in a cruel game. He is heartlessly toying with the anguish of
family members and the sympathies of all civilized people for the
plight of the hostages.''
   She said the United States and other western governments
discourage visits that the Iraqis can exploit for propaganda
purposes.
   The government will not support ``political, economic or other
concessions to Iraq in return for the release of hostages they hold
in violation of international law, she said.
   On Thursday, Ms. Tutwiler dismissed as ``cruel'' an Iraqi offer
to allow family members to make holiday visits to hostages in Iraq
and Kuwait.
   Other officials said that despite the U.S. embargo against Iraq,
family members can legally go there for purposes of family
reunification.

   A 19th-century outhouse with weathered
shingles and a rusty latch may not have been the site of many
memorable moments but officials are making a museum of it
nonetheless.
   The free-standing, three-seat outhouse, no longer in use, got an
honorable mention from the Connecticut Trust for Historic
Preservation at the state Capitol during ceremonies Wednesday to
recognize restored historical landmarks.
   It was chosen from among dozens of entries statewide, including
restored municipal buildings, houses and barns.
   ``It's a rare and endangered building,'' said Christopher
Wigren, project manager for the private, non-profit trust. ``It's
part of the past that is rapidly disappearing.''
   The venerable privy belongs to the former Ashford Academy, and
apparently was built with the two-story schoolhouse in the 1830s.
The academy graduated its last class in 1949, and until the Ashford
Historical Society moved in, it and the outhouse fell into
disrepair.
   The door of the dilapidated latrine was ripped off and was used
to fill in for the missing roof, and the floor was long gone. Brush
had nearly devoured the entire building before restoration began 18
months ago, said Lorraine S. McConnell, president of the society.
   After the society finishes restoring the academy, which will not
be until at least 1993, it plans to turn the schoolhouse and
outhouse into a museum, McConnell said.

<TEXT>
   Police killed at least 12 Hindus
attempting to storm a disputed Moslem mosque Friday, and more than
40 others died in violence as the religious dispute spread across
India to neighboring Moslem countries.
   Ten consecutive days of clashes between majority Hindus and
minority Moslems have left nearly 280 dead in India and at least
three dead in predominately Islamic Bangladesh.
   The unrest could also weaken Prime Minister V.P. Singh's chances
of surviving a Nov. 7 confidence vote. Singh lost his majority in
Parliament after Hindus withdrew from the 11-month-old coalition to
protest government handling of the mosque dispute.
   Fundamentalist Hindus seek to destroy the hilltop Babri Mosque
and build a a Hindu temple on the site in Ayodhya, 300 miles
southeast of New Delhi.
   Hindus say the 460-year-old mosque was built on the foundation
of an early temple marking the birthplace of Rama, the
much-worshiped warrior god. Moslems dispute the history and say
relinquishing the mosque would jeopardize hundreds of other Moslem
sites.
   Police have fired twice this week on Hindus attempting to
overrun the mosque. On Friday, a top district official said
witnesses' estimate of 12 dead was ``nearer to the truth'' than
reporters' tally of 10. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Doctors at a hospital in the nearby town of Faizabad said they
treated 64 injured people, including 48 wounded by gunfire. Several
policemen were also treated, they said.
   Reporters saw three buses and several jeeps torched by the mob.
Some homes were also burned.
   At least 25 deaths were reported in related riots across the
Uttar Pradesh state, where the mosque is located, the Press Trust
of India news agency reported.
   Thirteen more died Friday in the western state of Gujarat, the
news agency said. Other deaths were reported from Karnataka, Bihar,
Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh states.
   At least 279 people have died in India in recent violence linked
to the dispute, police and news agencies report. Last year, about
900 people were killed when a Hindu group first announced its
intention to take over the site by force.
   Most of those killed near the mosque recently were Hindus, but
authorities refuse to identify the faith of other victims out of
fear of exacerbating tensions.
   In Bangladesh, which has a Hindu minority, two people died
Friday of bullet wounds suffered during anti-Hindu protest earlier
this week in the capital of Dhaka.
   At least three people have been killed and 350 wounded in three
days of rioting in Dhaka and in 12 other cities. Two of those
killed were Moslems, and the religion of the third victim was not
immediately known.
   In Pakistan, India's predominately Islamic western neighbor,
several demonstrations were held to protest the violence and some
Islamic leaders called for larger pro-Moslem rallies.
   Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, said
the Indian government was half-heartedly protecting Moslem shrines.
   ``It was the moral duty of the Indian government to protect the
places of worship of Moslems,'' Jatoi said in a statemenet
published in the Pakistan Times. ``India, which pleads herself the
champion of secularism, has failed to give protection to holy
places of Moslems.''
   But one of those injured Friday near the mosque accused
government forces of shooting needlessly.
   ``Two policemen dragged a man out of the house and shot him in
the chest. Then they also shot two people who were crying over a
dead body. They were shot in the back,''said Bhupendra Singh
Rawat, speaking from a hospital bed.
   Rawat, a 24-year-old insurance agent from New Delhi, said he was
knocked down by a police officer's bamboo club.
   Former Indian Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal, a key figure in
efforts to replace Singh, said a government comprising all parties
should be set up to defuse the crisis.
   Singh, who lost his majority in Parliament after the pro-Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew, is expected to lose the
no-confidence vote. The prime minister is also beset by moves
within his National Front coalition for a new leader.
   Some newspapers and political commentators have called the
Ayodhya dispute the greatest threat to the country's secularism
since India gained independence in 1947.
   India's 880 million people are 82 percent Hindu and 12 percent
Moslem. The others include Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists. India's
constitution pledges tolerance of all religions and secularism.

   Britain and Albania will hold further talks about
restoring diplomatic ties severed more than 40 years ago, the
Foreign Office said Friday.
   Representatives of the two governments will meet in Rome on
Monday, a Foreign Office spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The two countries severed relations in 1946 after two Royal Navy
vessels struck mines and sank in the Corfu Channel, near Albania's
coast.Albania refused to pay compensation, and Britain impounded
Albanian gold held in the Bank of England.
   ``I suppose you could say an accident of history is coming to an
end,'' the Foreign Office spokesman said. ``The idea has gradually
emerged that links should be restored.''
   Michael Tait, an assistant under-secretary in the Foreign
Office, will lead the British team in Rome, the spokesman said.
Albania's vice minister for foreign affairs, Muhummed Kaplani, will
head the Albanian delegation.
   The two countries first talked about restoring relations in
Paris in 1985 and met for further exploratory discussions in 1988.
   Albania, a country of just over 3 million people, is considered
the last bastion of Stalinism.
   Under its previous leader, Enver Hoxha, it pursued a policy of
increasing diplomatic isolation.
   However, under Ramiz Alia, who became party leader and head of
state in April 1985, Albania slowly has been moving out of its
isolation and has restored diplomatic relations with dozens of
countries.

<TEXT>
   China's Communist authorities have arrested
two Roman Catholic bishops and 13 priests and deacons loyal to the
pope, a church-run news agency reported Friday.
   The Chinese clerics were accused of violating government laws on
religion and of being ``subjected to a foreign power,'' a reference
to the Vatican, the agency, Asia News said.
   It said the government accused the men of criticizing the
Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church, which is sponsored by the
Communist state and consecrates its own bishops. They also were
charged with illegally opening a seminary, ordaining priests and
preaching to minors, the agency said.
   It was not known what sentences the clerics received.
   China broke diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957 and
only allows worship under the guise of the Chinese Patriotic
Catholic Church.
   Asia News, an agency of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign
Missions, said the arrests took place in the coastal province of
Fujian.
   The two arrested bishops were identified as Monsignor Xie
Shiguang of Xiapu and Monsignor Hang Shoucheng of Fu'an.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scarred woman known as the Central Park
jogger was cross-examined Friday for the first time since she was
gang-raped and nearly beaten to death.
   One defense lawyer refused to question her, but the other asked
about her sex life, her job competence, her physical condition, her
memory and whether she had been assaulted by the men in her life.
   Many of his questions were not answered because the
prosecution's objections were sustained.
   The 30-year-old woman, who testified last summer at the trial of
three attackers, approached the witness stand with an unsteady gait
and nearly stumbled as she climbed to the box.
   With her blond hair cut in a short pageboy and combed back from
her face, a scar twisting from her left eyebrow to her rebuilt left
cheekbone was visible. During questioning by Assistant District
Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, the woman described her
hospitalization, her rehabilitation and the lingering effects of
the April 19, 1989, battering.
   She was found naked and near death and covered with mud and
blood in the northern end of the park after being gang-raped and
beaten. She had lost three-fourths of her blood and her skull was
broken in three places.
   ``I have difficulty with balance,'' she said. ``I have double
vision. I still have no sense of smell.'' She said she has to hold
reading materials askew to focus on them. Her testimony was similar
to what she said at the first trial.
   Six teen-agers were indicted for the attack on the woman and two
male joggers. Three were convicted of rape and assault in August
but acquitted of attempted murder; two are on trial now on the same
charges in state court. The sixth will be tried early next year.
   Colin Moore, lawyer for defendant Kharey Wise, suggested during
cross-examination that the woman's injuries were less serious than
the prosecution claimed, that a man she knew might have attacked
her, and that the attack occurred earlier than police had said.
   Moore asked the witness to explain her job as a vice president
in the corporate finance department at Salomon Bros., an investment
banking firm.
   She did, and in mild tones, Moore asked, ``It's fairly
complicated work, isn't it?''
   ``Yes,'' she replied.
   ``And you're very competent?''
   ``I like to think so,'' she said.
   Then Moore asked about her physical activities, apparently in an
attempt to show she was not as badly injured as claimed.
   ``Do you still go jogging?'' he asked.
   ``Yes, as part of my rehabilitation.''
   ``How often do you jog?''
   ``Five or six days a week.'' She also said she spends a couple
of hours a day in a gym several times a week.
   He asked her about driving, and she said she used to drive but
no longer does.
   Moore attempted to question her about Michael Allen, a former
male roommate and an alleged platonic friend with whom she canceled
a dinner date because of work the evening she was attacked.
   ``He was a friend?'' the lawyer asked.
   ``Yes,'' the witness answered.
   ``A very good friend?'' Moore asked.
   ``What do you mean by a very good friend?'' the witness asked.
   ``Were you intimate with him?'' Moore asked.
   Acting Justice Thomas Galligan sustained Lederer's objection.
   Wise, 18, and his co-defendant, Kevin Richardson, 16, looked
intently at the witness for much of her testimony.
   ``When you were at Metropolitan Hospital, do you remember
calling the name of a boyfriend?'' Moore asked.
   The judge sustained Lederer's objection.
   ``Do you remember saying certain things, three or four days
after admission to Metropolitan?'' Moore persisted.
   ``No, I was still in a coma.''
   ``Prior to April 19, did you have any altercation with Kevin
O'Reilly?'' the defense lawyer asked, referring to her steady
boyfriend. The objection to Moore's question was sustained.
   ``Prior to April 19 were you ever assaulted by any male
friend?''
   The objection to that question also was sustained.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir marked his 75th
birthday Friday and said despite the controversy and unrest
confronting Israel, he feels fulfilled in his life and work.
   Shamir, who heads the right-wing Likud bloc, hinted in newspaper
interviews he was contemplating retirement. But aides were quoted
as suggesting he may choose to run again for office in 1992, for
lack of an obvious successor.
   Despite tensions with Washington, President Bush was among those
sending good wishes, radio reports said. Family and friends joined
Shamir in cutting a cake at his office.
   ``It is no big deal to get old and reach this age,'' he said.
``But looking back one can see something was done and achieved in
the years that have passed.''
   Asked by a reporter for the Maariv daily how he saw his name
going down in history, Shamir said: ``Believe me, it doesn't
matter. I do know I have succeeded in fulfilling myself. ... I
haven't strayed either to the right or the left from my path.''
   Born in Ruzinoy, Poland, on Oct. 15, 1915, Shamir celebrates his
birthday according to the Jewish lunar calendar, or on the 14th day
of the month of Heshvan.
   Shamir led the anti-British terror group known as the Stern gang
before Israel's 1948 independence. After that, he was an agent for
the Mossad intelligence service for more than a decade.
   He was elected to Parliament in 1973 and took over as prime
minister 10 years later when Menachem Begin stepped down.
   Shamir's political longevity has defied expectations. The
dimunitive, introverted Shamir says one reason for that is that he
knows how to keep a lid on his emotions.
   ``I trained myself not to ever get too excited or angry. I
learned that when a person gets angry, he doesn't function right,''
Shamir told the Yedioth Ahronoth daily.
   In the protracted conflict over the future of the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, Shamir has held fast to his view that the
territories are an integral part of biblical Israel. He has
rejected U.S. calls for Israel to compromise with the Palestinians.
   ``From history I have learned that in times of crisis, the
decisive factor in the end is the consistency and determination of
a people standing by its views,'' he told Maariv.
   Shamir said he felt he had reached ``the peak of my activity''
and would have to face the prospect of retirement.
   ``I know that at some stage I will have to wind things up. I am
preparing for this moment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations high commissioner for refugees
announced Friday he is resigning after only 10 months of a
five-year term and said he will become Norway's foreign minister.
   Thorvald Stoltenberg's resignation came as a shock to the
agency, which is facing an unprecedented refugee crisis and has
been recovering from low morale under its previous leadership.
   Stoltenberg, 59, who was foreign minister from 1987 to 1989,
said in a statement he decided to resume the post because it was
``a critical moment for Norway.''
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will nominate a
successor, but there was no immediate indication of whom it might
be.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees supervises some 15 million
refugees worldwide, including 5 million Afghans in Iran and
Pakistan, about 2 million in southern Africa and the Horn of Africa
and many in southeast Asia.
   The agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981,
has been in financial crisis and last month approved an 11 percent
cut in next year's annual budget, to $345.5 million.
   In his statement, Stoltenberg said he was confident his
resignation would not compromise the U.N. agency's ability to help
refugees. He said the organization was ``on the right track'' in
meeting challenges posed by ``a rapidly evolving international
situation.''
   But refugee organizations in Norway immediately criticized his
move.
   ``It is letting down the refugees, and I must protest it
strongly,'' Annette Thommessen, who heads the Norwegian Association
of Asylum Seekers, told the national news agency NTB.
   ``Stoltenberg has accepted an extremely important job,'' she
said, adding that leaving was ``on the verge of being immoral and a
catastrophe for the U.N.''
   The U.N. General Assembly approved Stoltenberg, then Norway's
U.N. ambassador in New York, last November. He took up the post at
the start of January.
   He was the only candidate nominated by Perez de Cuellar after
Jean-Pierre Hocke of Switzerland left under a cloud of suspicion
and criticism.
   Hocke resigned over charges he misused a special education fund
for refugees to upgrade his air travel to first class. He was also
criticized for alleged financial mismanagement and favoritism, but
he denied wrongdoing and none was proven.

   A Yale graduate wo said God ordered him
to kill his mother, brother and two other people was found innocent
by reason of insanity Friday.
   Judge Miriam Span ordered Rolando Marcelo to undergo further
psychiatric examination to determine whether he is still dangerous.
   Span scheduled a Dec. 20 hearing to decide whether to commit
Marcelo, order further evaluations or release him.
   Marcelo confessed that he fatally stabbed his mother, Anita
Marcelo, 51; his brother, Raymond, 20; his friend, Nelson Paiva,
21; and neighbor Mark Dennis, 36.
   He also stabbed Richard Hartmann, 38, and chased 38-year-old
Robert Maul with a knife during the Memorial Day 1989 rampage.
   Evidence during the two-day, non-jury trial included Marcelo's
statment that he was the ``second Messiah'' and had to kill his
mother and brother so they could be resurrected to a better life.
   He told authorities he believed their dead bodies would be
invisible like the ghostly ballplayers in the movie ``Field of
Dreams,'' which Marcelo watched the night before the attack.
   He said he chased the visiting Paiva outside and stabbed him
while neighbors watched because Paiva had questioned him about
blood on his clothes, his eyeglasses and the kitchen floor. He said
then went after Hartmann and Maul, who witnessed Paiva's killing.
   ``This is pretty serious stuff,'' testified Dr. Irwin N. Perr, a
psychiatry professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of
New Jersey. ``That's not the usual form of criminal behavior.''
   Perr was one of several people who testified about Marcelo's
mental state.
   While most agreed that Marcelo had symptoms of mental illness,
they could not pinpoint which one he suffered from.
   Marcelo earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Yale in
1987 and was described as having an IQ between 111 and 133. His
last job was at Chemical Bank in New York City, which he left in
1988 after contracting Epstein-Barr Syndrome, said Union County
Assistant Prosecutor David Hancock.
   Perr is to evaluate Marcelo when he is moved to Trenton
Psychiatric Hospital within the next few days, Hancock said.
   Marcelo has been held at the Union County Jail in Elizabeth in
lieu of $4 million bail since his arrest.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Orders Hearing on JOA Application by Manteca Newspapers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Friday
ordered an administrative hearing to determine if two California
newspapers should be given an antitrust exemption to form a joint
operating agreement.
   Thornburgh rejected a recommendation from the Justice
Department's antitrust division that he deny the application to
form a joint operating agreement by the Manteca Bulletin and the
Manteca News, both of Manteca, Calif.
   Without a hearing, ``it is not possible to determine whether the
application should be approved or disapproved,'' Thornburgh said in
an opinion.
   ``A hearing is necessary to resolve material issues of fact
relating to whether the News is a `failing newspaper''' that would
qualify it for the antitrust exemption under the Newspaper
Preservation Act, Thornburgh wrote.
   The law allows two newspapers to form joint operating agreements
with the approval of the attorney general if one of the
publications is in ``probable danger of financial failure.''
   Thornburgh said the hearing should determine whether the News,
which is published Wednesdays and Fridays by Raymus Development &amp;
Sales Inc., could have avoided its continuing losses through
different management practices.
   The hearing should also determine the accuracy of antitrust
division's conclusion that the ``overriding objective (of the owner
of the News) for the past four years has been to reach the safety
net of this proposed JOA.''
   The antitrust division concluded in its Aug. 13 report that
``the applicants have decidedly failed to prove that (the
newspaper's losses) were incurred despite reasonable management
practices ... or that these losses could not be avoided if the News
were to operate on a more businesslike basis.''
   In a reply to the report, the News said it is suffering
irreversible losses and ``different management practices would not
be the cure in the future.''
   Thornburgh noted that a number of Manteca residents had
requested a hearing, which the attorney general said should be held
in that town.
   The joint operating application was filed July 13, 1988 by the
News and the daily Manteca Bulletin, which is owned by Morris
Newspapers.
   Under such arrangements, two competing newspapers merge their
commercial and production facilities but maintain their own news
staffs and produce separate editions.

<HEAD>Audit Shows Some Farmers Double-Dip Into Subsidies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Interior Department audit shows that some
western farmers regularly double-dip into federal irrigation and
crop subsidies.
   The report by the department's Office of Inspector General said
farmers in 1986 received Bureau of Reclamation water subsidies
conservatively estimated at $66 million to irrigate lands that
produced surplus crops.
   At the same time, the Agriculture Department paid the same
farmers $379 million to limit surplus crop production.
   ``For example, we found that eight farms that produced surplus
crops received over $2.1 million in irrigation subsidies while
collecting about $4.5 million in various agriculture commodity
program subsidies during the three-year period from 1986 through
1988.''
   The farmers received dual subsidies because Interior and
Agriculture ``did not make concerted efforts to coordinate their
programs,'' said the report, released to the press Friday.
   The audit did not specify exactly how many farmers may have
gotten double subsidies.
   Interior auditors concluded the dual subsidies ``should be
discontinued expeditiously'' and that changes be made to coordinate
the two programs.
   But the report said Interior has not expressed general support
for eliminating the dual subsidies and has not supported bills in
Congress that would do so.
   ``Department officials have expressed concern that eliminating
the dual subsidy could create financial hardships for some farmers
while not significantly reducing the cost of the nation's overall
farm subsidy program,'' the report said.
   The subsidies are derived from the use of water from huge Bureau
of Reclamation projects, which provide low-cost irrigation on about
10 million acres of farmland in 17 western states.
   Farmers are subsidized by the Bureau of Reclamation selling them
water for less than the full amount needed to recover the
government's investment in the irrigation facilities.
   In 1986, the report said, those lands produced crops with a
gross value of $7.5 billion, including 121 million bushels of corn,
65 million bushels of wheat, 47 million bushels of barley, and 1.6
million bales of cotton.
   The question of using subsidized water to grow surplus crops has
been examined a number of times over the years.
   Legislation to limit or eliminate the double subsidies has
circulated in Congress. The House passed a bill that was weakened
by the Senate and never received final congressional approval.

   A bomb hidden in a car killed a
part-time soldier Friday, police said, and the Irish Republican
Army reportedly claimed responsibility.
   Police said the slain man was 34-year-old Albert Cooper, a
member of the Ulster Defense Regiment, a locally recruited army
unit. Its members have been frequent targets of the IRA, which is
fighting British rule in Northern Ireland.
   The domestic British agency, Press Association, said the IRA
claimed responsibility for the killing in a call to a local radio
station.
   Witnesses said a dark-haired young woman drove a car into a shop
where Cooper worked in Cookstown, 30 miles west of Belfast. She
said she needed a new muffler, and left, the witnesses said.
   They said the the bomb went off when Cooper opened the car door.
Two other men working in the garage escaped injury.
   Police were looking for the woman.
   The bombing came one week after Protestant gunmen killed a
member of the IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, near
Cookstown. The IRA had threatened retaliation.
   Friday's killing was the 64th this year attributed to political
and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
   In Warrington, England, a soldier killed by an IRA bomb last
week was buried with military honors on Friday.
   Stephen Beacham was one of five members of the King's Regiment
killed by an explosion at a checkpoint near Londonderry on Oct. 24.
Beacham died days before he had planned to come home to see his
3-week-old son for the first time.
   A Roman Catholic civilian, who had been forced to drive the
explosives to the checkpoint, was also killed in the Londonderry
bombing.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III revised
his travel plans Friday to add meetings in Moscow next week on the
Persian Gulf crisis with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Baker also scheduled a meeting in Cairo on Tuesday with Chinese
Foreign Minister Qichen Qian.
   The sessions reflect an expanding U.S. campaign to pressure Iraq
to end its three-month occupation of Kuwait. The Soviet Union and
China are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and their
support would be essential for any tougher U.N.-backed economic
sanctions or military action,
   Baker is also going to the Persian Gulf to see leaders of
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the ousted Kuwaiti government, to Egypt
and to Turkey, Britain and France - all within an eight-day span.
He takes off Saturday morning.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler described the
purpose of Baker's trip as consultation with ``our coalition
partners over a full range of diplomatic, economic and military
matters.''
   Baker on Friday called in the new Israeli ambassador, Zalman
Shoval, for a 55-minute session. He is bypassing Israel again on
his travels. Baker said this week he wanted to avoid linking the
Arab-Israeli dispute to the campaign to reverse Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Shoval told reporters the U.S.-Israeli relationship ``does not
have to be emphasized every day.''
   The ambassador said he was confident Baker would make a trip to
Israel soon and that his country shared with the United States an
interest in promoting peace talks.
   Baker will fly to Moscow from Ankara, Turkey, on Wednesday and
meet with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze on Thursday and Friday.
   Apart from the gulf situation, Baker will take up with the
Soviet foreign minister lingering technical issues in the landmark
arms control treaty to be signed at a 34-nation summit President
Bush is scheduled to attend in Paris later this month. The White
House said Friday that Bush would continue on to the gulf to spend
Thanksgiving with U.S. troops.
   The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, the most sweeping arms
control accord in history, would set limits on tanks, anti-aircraft
artillery and various other categories of non-nuclear weapons from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains of the Soviet Union.
   Bush, speaking at a news conference in Orlando, Fla., Thursday,
said the pending treaty was ``all but put to bed'' with the
exception of one ``tiny technical matter. Hopefully, it's been
resolved by now.''
   Baker and Shevardnadze will discuss the way the Soviet Union and
its allies will divide non-nuclear arms allowed to the Warsaw Pact
under the treaty.
   Also, within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, two U.S.
allies, Norway and Turkey, want to lower the ceilings of arms
permitted the Soviet Union in the zone that includes the two
countries.
   The U.S. officials and private arms control specialists who
discussed the issues did not say the summit might be set back. But
they stressed the deadline is less than three weeks away.
   The Soviets have lost East Germany as an ally. Hungary is
teetering, but remains in the Warsaw Pact with Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania.
   As these countries grow more independent, veering further away
from Moscow, the likelihood of them using their weapons in a joint
military action with the Soviet Union becomes remote.
   And yet, the United States has a tactical stake in how the
Warsaw Pact resolves the issue as well as how the Soviets
distribute their permissible weapons within the zones in their own
country.
   Baker and Shevardnadze announced basic agreement on all
outstanding issues in New York in early October but failed to
conclude a U.S.-Soviet pact to curb long-range nuclear weapons.

   A minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's new
all-German Cabinet said East Germany's former Communist Party has
assets of up to $200 billion, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The figure is a hundred times bigger than the sum named by
officials of the former Communist Party.
   Hansjoachim Walther, a member of the former East German
Parliament who was appointed as a minister-without-portfolio in
Kohl's Cabinet after the Germanys united on Oct. 3, made the
remarks in an interview in the daily Dresdner Morgenpost.
   The report follows the arrest of three former Communist Party
officials who admitted to illegally funneling about $70 million in
party funds to the Soviet Union.
   Two of the officials, Wolfgang Pohl and Wolfgang Langnitschke,
were arrested last week, and Karl-Heinz Kaufmann, who was being
sought on an international warrant, was arrested on Thursday in
Oslo, Norway.
   Kaufmann, 42, was arrested when he went to a bank to discuss the
transfer of $45 million from an account he controlled, newspapers
reported. He is also suspected of transferring $21 million to a
Netherlands bank, the Oslo newspaper Arbeiderbladet reported.
   Olso police spokesman Svein Olav Kristiansen said Kaufmann does
not oppose extradition.
   The Party of Democratic Socialism, built from the remnants of
the East German Communist Party, claimed the transfers were a debt
repayment to the Soviet Communist Party, said Norwegian reports.
   Walther, head of the conservative German Social Union Party, was
asked by the Dresdner Morgenpost to give his views on the wealth of
the party.
   ``I consider it possible they have holdings of between 200
billion o 300 billion marks,'' the equivalent of $133 billion to
$200 billion, the newspaper quoted Walther as saying.
   The Democratic Socialists, headed by Gregor Gysi, are fighting
to minimize the repercussions of the money scandal as Germany
approaches parliamentary elections on Dec. 2.
   Gysi has estimated the party's wealth at $1.3 billion, and has
promised a full disclosure of its holdings to clear up the scandal.
He has also denied prior knowledge about the money leaving the
country.
   In former East Germany, most property and businesses were owned
by the state and run by the Communists. Although the businesses
were supposed to be turned over to a government trust, the
Communists are widely suspected of spending their last days in
power hiding and transferring the wealth.
   At a parliament session in Bonn on Tuesday, Ingrid
Matthaeus-Maier, a prominent member of the leftist Social
Democrats, charged the Democratic Socialists had taken over the
``material worth of the old Communist state without accepting
responsibility for 40 years of injustice and a ruined economy.''
   Also Friday, prosecutors probing former East German Communist
leader Erich Honecker said they had stepped up their investigation,
but Honecker said he is not afraid of a trial.
   Prosecutors are trying to decide whether there is enough
evidence to charge the 78-year-old Honecker with corruption and
murder for the shoot-to-kill orders aimed at would-be escapees.
About 200 people were killed trying to flee from East Germany's
hard-line regime.
   ``I am not afraid of a show trial. I consider all the charges so
far brought by the prosecutor's office untenable,'' Honecker was
quoted as saying in an interview published in The European
newspaper.
   German Legislator Wolfgang Boetsch said Honecker was
demonstrating his ``mockery of the people and cynicism.''

   A convoy of trucks headed into the central
Angolan bush Friday, carrying the first food supplies from a United
Nations program to aid 2 million people facing starvation.
   Under the six-month U.N. plan, 130 million tons of food will be
distributed to the hungry in half the 18 provinces of this southern
African nation hit by drought and civil war.
   The first convoy was delayed 24 hours after United Nations
officials said they had insufficient guarantees of the trucks'
safety from U.S.-backed rebels fighting the leftist government.
   U.N. officials said the UNITA guerrillas provided assurances of
the trucks' safe conduct through rebel-held territory after they
were given details about the makeup of the convoy.
   Last month, UNITA and the Angola government agreed to set up
``peace corridors'' along which humanitarian aid could move safely.
   Friday's 25-vehicle convoy was carrying 400 tons of food from
the western port of Lobito to central provinces hit the hardest by
war and drought. Lobito lies on the Atlantic Ocean, about 250 miles
south of Luanda.
   The convoy was expected to arrive Saturday at its destination,
the city of Huambo, 150 miles east of Lobito.
   Portuguese news reports Friday indicated UNITA requested to
delay peace talks with the government for at least seven days. The
talks were scheduled to begin Tuesday in Portugal.
   The reports said UNITA sought more time to study Portuguese
peace proposals.
   A leading official from the Portuguese government team which has
mediated at four negotiating rounds this year between the Angolan
foes said this week a truce was unlikely before next year.
   UNITA - the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
- has been fighting the Soviet-backed government since Angola
gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEAD>U.S. Trying To Bring Down Japanese Timber Tariffs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. negotiators at international trade talks
in Geneva pushed Friday to increase exports of American finished
wood products by eliminating $1 billion worth of Japanese tariffs,
a congressman said.
   The direct talks with the Japanese are part of a larger attempt
to reduce tariffs worldwide in negotiations with the European
Community on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Officials for the U.S. Trade Representative's Office told an
aide to Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., on Friday they are optimistic some
kind of favorable agreement will be reached over the next month.
   Wyden said in a telephone interview from Portland, Ore., that
the Japanese ``essentially committed'' to tariff reductions during
the Super 301 talks this summer.
   ``I think ultimately what we are saying is that the Japanese
have to live up to their end of the bargain. This market-opening
agreement struck with the Japanese in effect said there are going
to be substantial Japanese tariff reductions,'' he said.
   ``We are talking about more than a billion dollars worth of
sales and 40,000 jobs. This is absolutely critical to our region
right now at a time the timber cut has gone down as a result of the
decisions on the northern spotted owl. I think that one of our big
job-producers can be assuring access to Japanese markets.''
   U.S. trade officials expect the Japanese initially to resist the
push toward tariff elimination, but likely eventually will go along
with some reductions as outlined in the Super 301 agreements this
summer, Wyden aide Steve Jenning said.
   During those talks, the Japanese agreed to ease various fire,
building and inspection standards that are expected to boost U.S.
wood products exports by about $1.5 billion annually.
   However, the Japanese said during Super 301 talks they would not
commit to specific tariff reductions until the GATT negotiations in
Geneva.

<TEXT>
   Aides to Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
on Friday accused state television of giving Lech Walesa favorable
treatment in its campaign coverage.
   Walesa and Maziwiecki are facing off in Poland's first popular
presidential election, to be held Nov. 25.
   In a letter to the State Election Commission, the press office
of Mazowiecki's campaign listed examples of broadcasts it said
supported Walesa, or included anti-Mazowiecki remarks. It asked
election officials to demand that television management ``put an
end to such practices.''
   Jan Dworak, deputy chairman of the state Radio and Television
Committee, responded that the state television was trying to report
on the campaign in a balanced manner. He said he had received a
similar protest from Walesa's camp only a few days ago.
   ``We cannot give up our basic informative function,'' Dworak
said in a telephone interview. ``We cannot decide not to show the
prime minister or the (Solidarity) chairman for the next month.''
   The letter from Mazowiecki's office cited commentaries by
journalists supporting the Solidarity chairman or criticizing
government policies. It complained also about the sequence of news
items on television newscasts.
   Dworak said television journalists had been told to be impartial
and to put out a balanced news report.
   ``I understand the growing pre-election emotions of all sides,''
he said. ``I try to analyze all those cases but at the same time I
cannot take off the screen all news programs and leave only sports
and weather forecasts.''
   Each of the six candidates has been allotted equal and free time
on the state radio and television by election officials. Their
campaign spots, which are carried on the two television channels
and four radio stations, started Monday.

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brig. Gen. Mike Myatt watched his
game plan to counter an Iraqi attack go awry in the desert of
eastern Saudi Arabia, but in the end the Marines won the day.
   And for the commander, it was a good test of conditions his
forces would confront in a real war.
   ``You always say the plan is good until you have to execute it,
and then you have to change it,'' the 49-year-old infantry officer
said with a wry laugh. ``Whatever we plan, the enemy's going to
plan some variations.''
   The key, he said, is leaders at allng quickly to
change.
   And that is why the Iraqis were defe levels respondiated in the simulated
battle
Friday - even if the Marines didn't choose the battlefield.
   For the past two months, about 30,000 Marines commanded by Myatt
have been conducting war games in the desert, with Marines
defending Saudi Arabia against a mock Iraqi invasion.
   During an exercise this week, the general was out in a mobile
light armored command vehicle, racing across the undulating desert
terrain at speeds up to 60 mph, deploying his forces in response to
ahe main communications problem, Myatt said, is a blackout in
parts of the desert between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.
   One way to compensate is sending up planes. Once a C-130 was
airborne over the exercise, the command vehicle's communications
improved and its range expanded.
   Myatt, who spent two tours in Vietnam, commands all Marine
ground and air forces in Saudi Arabia. More than 10,000 Marines are
also deployed in the northern Arabian Sea where they have been
practicing amphibious assault landings.
   The months of desert training, he said, have put the force in
fighting shape.
   ``I think we owe it to the mamas and the papas of all these
Marines out here to give them the best training that can be,''
Myatt said.
   ``They ought to know the leaders in charge of their sons and
daughters aren't crazy and aren't hoping for hostilities to break
out,'' he said. ``But if we have to do it, we're prepared.''

<HEAD>Probe Makes Adjustments Aimed at Extending Sun Study Time</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ulysses adjusted its course toward
Jupiter on Friday using a maneuver designed to increase the amount
of time the spacecraft will spend studying the sun's poles.
   The probe ignited its thrusters to slightly change the course,
said Franklin O'Donnell, spokesman for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``This is just to tweak the trajectory for the maximum amount of
time over the sun's poles,'' he said.
   The latest mid-course correction and four days of thruster
firings that began Oct. 15 will add a week to the time the $250
million Ulysses spends orbiting the sun's high latitudes during its
five-year, $750 million joint mission by NASA and the European
Space Agency.
   Ulysses was launched from space shuttle Discovery on Oct. 6. On
Feb. 8, 1992, the spacecraft will use Jupiter as a ``gravity
slingshot'' to leave the plane in which all the planets orbit the
sun. That will allow Ulysses to fly almost over the sun's south
pole in 1994 and north pole in 1995.
   O'Donnell said another trajectory maneuver may be needed in the
weeks before Ulysses whizzes around Jupiter.

<DATELINE>LULING, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Clayton Williams embarked on a
whistle-stop tour Friday and Democrat Ann Richards campaigned with
U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt, while two polls showed the
gubernatorial slugfest tightening.
   A Mason-Dixon opinion survey conducted for various media
organiations put Williams at 45 percent and Richards at 43 percent.
A Texas Poll showed the race 42-35 for Williams.
   The Mason-Dixon Poll was based on interviews with 824 likely
voters between Monday and Wednesday. It had a margin of error of
3.5 points. Since Oct. 11, that survey said, Williams' support has
fallen from 51 percent to 45 percent.
   The Texas Poll, conducted Oct. 19-29 by the Public Policy
Resources Laboratory of Texas A&amp;M University for Harte-Hanks
Communications, involved interviews with 622 likely voters. It had
a margin of error of 4 points.
   With the election just four days away, Williams made seven stops
during his railroad tour from San Antonio to Houston.
   ``Thanks for comin' out today,'' he shouted to a cheering crowd
in Luling.
   ``Luling, Texas, a little bit of the oil patch. I come from the
oil patch. When oil was $40 a barrel and Texas was booming I was
6-feet-four,'' Williams said, gesturing well above his head. ``But
now, I'm all that's left.''
   Williams began each stop introducing several members of his
family. Then he would give a speech, step off the train, shake
hands, kiss babies and ask for votes.
   Between stops, the train would speed past miles and miles of
rural ranchland. In Luling, bales of hay lined one part of the
railroad tracks while a donkey stood nearby wearing a red blanket
and visor that said ``We Love Claytie.''
   In Longview, Richards raised the issue of intimidation of black
voters and called again for Williams to release his income tax
returns.
   ``You ought to be able to see whether or not someone who aspires
to lead this state cares enough about government to pay his fair
share in running the government,'' she said.
   Before the rally, Richards was asked about allegations by
Democratic national leaders that Republicans have been intimidating
voters in east Texas.
   The Democratic officials cited a newspaper ad warning of jail
terms and fines for violating absentee voting regulations and said
black voters who got mail ballots also received anonymous postcards
threatening prosecution of those who gave a false reason for
requesting a mail ballot.
   Gregg County Republican Chairman William Osborne has defended
the newspaper ad and said Republicans had nothing to do with the
postcards.
   ``This is a repeated pattern,'' Richards charged. ``I've been
through a lot of elections where they attempted to do that. It is
so cynical that you would distort and attempt to take advantage of
someone's democratic right in this free society and keep them from
voting.''

   An American Airlines DC-10 en route to Dallas

   None of the 225 passengers aboard Flight 51 required any medical

   Passengers were taken off the plane and put on another American

   The plane had a wing flap that would not contract and reported
blowing a tire during takeoff from London's Gatwick Airport, said
airline spokesman Tim Smith.

<HEAD>New International Anti-Drug Agreement Coming Into Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new global pact that provides for
seizure of drug traffickers' bank accounts and property means
``there is no place for them to hide throughout the world,'' U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Friday.
   The accord also commits nations to extradite accused drug
traffickers to the countries where they face charges.
   ``It aims to hit the drug traffickers where it hurts the most;
that is to say, in their freedom of movement and their liberty,''
said Margaret J. Anstee, coordinator of all U.N.-drug control
activities. Both she and Thornburgh spoke about the new pact at a
news conference at the United Nations.
   The new agreement, known as the U.N. Convention Against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, takes effect
Nov. 11.
   It binds the United States and 26 other nations that accepted it
to cooperate in battling drug trafficking. Sixty-two more nations
and the European Economic Community have indicated they will adopt
it.
   ``Nov. 11 is a date that used to be observed worldwide as
Armistice Day, marking the end of the first World War,'' Thornburgh
said. ``Nov. 11 this year, however, is anything but an Armistice
Day. It is a worldwide declaration of war upon those engaged in
illegal drug trafficking around the world.''
   The convention criminalizes each step of the drug-trafficking
process, from cultivation or production of precursor chemicals to
laundering of profits.
   Among its major provisions:
   -All signatory nations agree to share criminal evidence and to
extradite accused traffickers, eliminating safe havens;
   -Nations agree to adopt banking laws that allow them to seize
drug profits and banking records;
   -The manufacture and sale of chemicals needed to make drugs is
to be monitored in each nation;
   -Shipments of illegal drugs are to be allowed to pass through
countries so police agencies can trace them to their recipients, a
technique common in the United States but new in international law.
   -Signatory nations will require commercial shipping, airline,
and other transport companies to take steps to make sure their
carriers are not used to carry drugs.
   ``The convention is a determined statement by the international
community that it will not tolerate the misery, degradation and
death being perpetrated by drug traffickers on a massive scale,''
said Anstee.
   The accord was initially called for by 106 nations at an
international conference in Vienna, Austria, in December 1988.

   The California environmental initiative
known as Big Green has lost some of its supporters, according to
results of a poll released Friday that projected a close vote next
week.
   The initiative, Proposition 128, was favored by 41 percent of
the voters surveyed and opposed by 43 percent in the last
pre-election poll, pollster Mervin Field reported.
   In early October, a poll by Field's organization showed Big
Green's supporters led its opponents by 15 points.
   The initiative would curb auto emissions, ban oil development in
state waters, bar pesticides suspected of causing cancer and create
an elected post of environmental czar.
   The Field organization said the poll has a 5.8-point margin of
error. The latest figures were based on a survey of 1,248 voters in
late October.

   The party invitations from former GOP
candidate Vince Orza were supposed to be tongue in cheek, but some
state Republicans aren't amused.
   Defeated in his bid for the Republican gubernatorial nomination
in Oklahoma, Orza held ``The Orza for Governor Party ... 94!?''
   The invitation read:
   ``Vince and Patti cordially invite you to celebrate our victory
- our defeat and make fun of Bill Price.''
   Republican Price, who defeated Orza in the primary runoff,
already was irked because Orza refused to endorse him.
   Orza's party was held last weekend and among those attending was
Price's Democratic opponent, David Walters. The Democrat won a
straw poll of partygoers.
   Orza says his views are closer to those of Walters than Price on
many issues. Orza has reminded reporters he pledged at the time of
the runoffs only to support the Republican Party, and said he
endorses neither Walters nor Price.
   That brought howls of outrage from some Republicans and the
invitation caused consternation.
   ``If this is a real deal, he's got the political judgment of
Saddam Hussein,'' Republican state Sen. Gary Gardenhire said after
viewing a copy of the invitation.
   ``I thought it stunk,'' Price aide Mike McCarville said
Thursday.

   Senate candidate Paul Wellstone asked TV
stations to stop airing an advertisement supporting the re-election
of Sen. Rudy Boschwitz. The stations refused.
   The ad by the Auto Dealers and Drivers for Free Trade Political
Action Committee describes Boschwitz as a man who escaped Nazi
Germany as young boy and started his own business. It says he is a
leader in the federal child nutrition program and has been honored
by groups that support cutting government waste.
   The Jamaica, N.Y.,-based PAC has no connection to Minnesota and
its last-minute campaign doesn't allow voters to judge the
independent group's credibility, says Wellstone.
   ``This kind of intrusion is exactly what is turning people off
to politics. What are these outsiders buying with this'' money?
said Wellstone.
   Twenty-five to 30 of its member dealerships are in Minnesota,
said Frank Glacken, the PAC's executive director.
   The ad is costing the PAC $192,000 and started running

   Executives from Twin Cities television stations KARE, KMSP, KSTP

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Romanians marched angrily
through Bucharest for the second straight day Friday to protest
government-announced price increases.
   About 2,000 workers of the Alfa trade union rallied in front of
Parliament. An additional 3,000 protesters marched from central
University Square to government headquarters, chanting demands that
President Ion Iliescu resign.
   The crowds dispersed peacefully later in the evening.
   The protesters first assembled Thursday evening, after the
government lifted price controls, doubling or tripling the cost of
some foods and other consumer items. Rents, energy and certain
basic food items were excluded from the price hikes.
   Demonstrators blocked traffic on Nicolae Balcescu boulevard, a
main thoroughfare. They waved flags and banners protesting the
price rises, and shouted ``Down with Iliescu!''
   Officials of Alfa, an umbrella organization of unions from heavy
industries, also demanded that the government privatize more than
the 30 percent of state-owned companies it plans to sell as part of
its reform package.
   The government said Friday it will compensate pensioners,
handicapped people and some groups of workers to help ease the
price increase shock.
   It also announced it would double the interest rates offered on
savings by banks and approved plans to open up 100 state-owned
firms to foreign capital.
   Gabriel Andreescu, a leading opposition figure, expressed
concern that the government might respond with force if
demonstrations continued.
   But special police units, brought downtown Thursday, kept out of
sight behind the nearby Senate building on Friday.
   The last major protests at University Square were in August,
when anti-government demonstrators blocked the square every evening
for a week. About 100 people were arrested.
   The protesters accused Iliescu, a former Communist, of keeping
many of the policies and attitudes of the former hard-line
government led by Nicolae Ceausescu. Ceausescu and his wife, Elena,
were executed in December's popular uprising.
   In the spring, University Square was occupied for 53 days by
anti-Communist ralliers. In mid-June the government sent in police
and miners, who clubbed and beat demonstrators, leading to six
deaths.

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 5,000 people gathered in a
stadium Friday for a group meditation to send good vibrations to
the Persian Gulf and help avoid war there.
   Twenty minutes of medititation is ``kind of short'' to result in
world peace, but the event may result in ``some softening, some
kind of statement that is more reconciliatory'' said David
Orme-Johnson, a psychologist at the Maharishi International
University in Fairfield, Iowa.
   Organizers from the Swedish branch of Transcendental Meditation
had hoped to fill the 15,000-seat Globe stadium for the largest
group meditation in history. But about 5,000 people bought $35
tickets for the event. About three-fourths of those attending were
experienced meditators.
   A group in the Netherlands in recent years brought together
7,000 people for a mass meditation.
   Organizers of Friday's event said thousands of other people
around the world also concentrated their energies during the
20-minute meditation.
   Transcendental Meditation founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
delivered a message in a phone linkup from the Netherlands. ``I
expect that we will very soon have irrevocable peace on earth,'' he
said.
   Czechoslovakia's president-writer Vaclav Havel, a meditation
practitioner, also sent a message, the organizers said.
   Swedish Lutherans and some other Protestant churches objected to
the event. ``As we see it, it is a covert way of spreading Hinduism
and we think people who practice it should be made aware of that,''
said the Rev. Dan Salomonson of the Philadelphia Pentecostal Church
in Stockholm.
   Transcendental Meditation was introduced in Europe and the
United States in the 1960s. Individuals repeat a mantra, or sacred
word, to achieve a relaxed physical and mental state in which some
goal can be envisioned.
   Orme-Johnson, 49, implied that organized group meditation had
led to a softening of Saddam Hussein's martial stance since the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   A meditation by 3,000 people in Iowa last month may have created
a lull in the gulf crisis, he said.
   ``That was the time of Saddam's dream and of talk of troop
reductions'' in Kuwait, he said, referring to unconfirmed reports
that Iraq's president was told in a dream to leave Kuwait.

<HEAD>Government May Drop Civil Suits in U.S. Against Marcoses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino said Friday
her government may reach out-of-court settlements with the family
of late President Ferdinand Marcos in a number of civil lawsuits
pending in U.S. courts.
   Local newspapers reported the Marcoses and a presidential
commission were nearing an agreement whereby the government would
get 60 percent of the funds deposited in five Hong Kong bank
accounts by representatives of Marcos.
   ``The projected settlement does not entail dropping civil cases
in the Philippines, but possibly civil suits in the U.S. only, if
the amounts recovered are significant,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a
statement. ``Criminal cases are not part of the settlement.''
   The Marcoses face 33 civil suits in the Philippines but have
never been charged with a criminal offense because the government
feared they would demand their right to return from exile in the
United States to defend themselves.
   Marcos died in September 1989 in Hawaii, where he fled after his
ouster in the 1986 popular uprising that propelled Mrs. Aquino into
the presidency.
   Imelda Marcos was acquitted in July of criminal charges in New
York City that she and her husband embezzled money from the
Philippines treasury and used it to buy four buildings in New York.
   On Thursday, several leading Manila newspapers reported that the
Marcos accounts were in the Wing Lung Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered
Bank, Hang Lung Bank, Banque de L'Indochine and the Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corp.
   David Castro, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, was quoted as saying that both the Marcoses and the
government do not know the exact amount held in the accounts.
   ``We both realized that if we continue to litigate on (Marcos')
money held in trust by other people outside the country...we could
not expect immediate recovery within the time frame of the needs of
our people,'' Castro said.
   The government claims Marcos looted billions of dollars from the
national treasury during his 20-year administration and deposited
it in Swiss banks or used it to buy real estate outside the
country.
   The money recovered from the Marcoses would be used to fund the
administration's agrarian reform program.
   The government has filed civil suits against Marcos in the
Southern District Court of California. The court has frozen all
suspected Marcos assets worldwide, including the Hong Kong
accounts, but government lawyers reportedly will seek to exclude
them.

<HEAD>Mozambique Fighting Spurs New Flight of Refugees to Malawi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fighting between rebels and government forces in
Mozambique has driven 13,000 refugees across the border to Malawi
in the last three weeks, a relief agency said Friday.
   In a statement, the French aid group Medicins Sans Frontieres,
or Doctors Without Borders, estimated up to 15,000 more people will
flee Mozambique by the end of November.
   Over the past decade, an estimated 850,000 refugees from
Mozambique have crossed into southern Malawi, located north of
Mozambique in East Africa.
   They are fleeing a war between the Marxist government in Maputo
and guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance organization,
known as RENAMO.
   The latest round of fighting is said to be taking place in the
central Mozambican province of Zambesia.
   Aid officials in Malawi estimate as many as 19,000 people are
without shelter and say food supplies and sanitary conditions at
refugee camps are being strained by the new influx.

<HEAD>Court Blocks Some Louisiana Judicial Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday blocked some
judicial elections scheduled for Tuesday in Louisiana.
   The court, by a 7-2 vote, granted an emergency request by blacks
in the state who said the elections would violate the federal
Voting Rights Act.
   The court order barred elections for trial judges in 10
districts and appeals court judges in two districts.
   The blacks said the districts - as well as the election date -
are invalid because they have not been approved by the Justice
Department as required by the voting rights law.
   Some judges in the districts already were elected in an Oct. 6
primary. The blacks said they should be barred from taking office.
   A three-judge federal court on Oct. 24 permitted the elections
but warned candidates that winners would be removed from office if
their districts did not receive federal approval within 90 days.
The three-judge court also approved holding any run-off elections,
if necessary, on Dec. 8.
   Friday's high court order also suspends any run-off elections
for the affected districts.
   The Bush administration sided with the blacks who challenged the
judicial elections. The Justice Department said permitting the
elections would violate the voting rights act, even though the
judges only would be elected on a provisional basis.
   The law requires Louisiana and other Southern states to submit
any election changes for Justice Department approval.
   The department said incumbent judges could remain in office
until it has the chance to study the districts and decide whether
the voting power of blacks has been reduced illegally.
   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun dissented, voting
to permit the elections.
   The case is Clark vs. Roemer, A-327.

   New York state officials say that based on new
and ``extensive'' evidence of wrongdoing by New York Telephone, the
Federal Communications Commission should reconsider a consent
decree that ended its investigation of the New York and New England
Telephone companies.
   In a filing scheduled for delivery Monday to the FCC, Robert
Abrams, the state attorney general, and Richard Kessel, executive
director of the New York Consumer Protection Board, said New York
Telephone's violations of commission rules on affiliate
transactions ``was far more extensive and had a far greater effect
on NYT's rates than the commission believed when it adopted the
consent decree.''
   A copy of the filing made available to The Associated Press on
Friday also said the FCC had not given an explanation for agreeing
to the consent decree and that it had foreclosed participation by
New York authorities into the investigation of the two Nynex Corp.
subsidiaries.
   On Oct. 4, the FCC announced that the two telephone companies
had agreed to make voluntary contributions totaling $1.4 million to
the U.S. Treasury. They also agreed to cut their long-distance
rates $35.5 million to resolve allegations that they overcharged
customers through a Nynex subsidiary, Materiel Enterprises Co.
   In exchange, the FCC ended its investigation without finding any
wrongdoing.
   The FCC in February had said it intended to fine the two
telephone companies $1.4 million - a record amount - over apparent
violations of FCC rules governing transactions between regulated
telephone companies and unregulated affiliates.
   The FCC had ordered the companies to return $35.5 million to
long-distance customers because of alleged $118.5 million in
overcharges to NYT and NET by Nynex Materiel Enterprises Co.
(MECO), an unregulated Nynex purchasing subsidiary.
   The companies agreed to the $35.5 million rebate, to be made
within 30 days, and also said they would reduce their capital
accounts by $32.6 million to ``remove the alleged excess profits on
plant and equipment purchased from MECO.''
   Local phone rates were not be affected by the rebates.
   A few days before the FCC consent decree, New York state utility
regulators authorized a study into whether Nynex should be forced
to divest New York Telephone.
   The new filing said evidence submitted during a rate increase
proceeding show that FCC methodology ``vastly understates the
unjust and unreasonable charges ultimately passed on to New York
consumers in their interstate rates.''
   As a result, New York long-distance ratepayers ``have paid rates
inflated by NYT's imprudent overpayments to MECO and other Nynex
unregulated affiliates.''
   An FCC spokeswoman, Audrey Spivack, said the commission had not
seen the filing and could not comment.
   Nynex spokesman Peter Goodale said by telephone from New York
that he had not seen the filing and could not respond to specifics.
But he noted that the telephone companies already had taken steps
to comply with th consent decree, including making the $1.4
million payment to the Treasury.
   ``We've upheld our end of the bargain and we hope the FCC does
as well,'' Goodale said.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Friday permitted interviews with
several American, British and Japanese hostages, who said they
eagerly want to go home and denied reports they were being
mistreated.
   The Iraqi Ministry of Information took a group of Baghdad-based
reporters to different strategic sites to discount recent reports
that foreign hostages are maltreated.
   ``I love freedom. When I get out of this and go home, I'll go to
the beaches and have a nice swim,'' said a man who identified
himself as Clem J. Hall, an educator from Takoma Park, Md.
   Hall said he was in Kuwait until Sept. 19 and was moved to a
Baghdad hotel before he and others were taken to vital economic and
military installations in Iraq.
   He and nine other foreigners at a site about 60 miles north of
Baghdad said they received adequate food and denied any
mistreatment by their unarmed guards.
   Officials insisted the exact location or the name of the site
should not be mentioned.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, prompting a U.S.-dominated
military buildup in Saudi Arabia. Iraqi officials responded to the
buildup by refusing to allow Westerners to leave the country.
   They later allowed women and children to leave, but took some
600 Western and Japanese men to strategic sites as ``guests'' to
try to prevent an attack on Iraq.
   In recent days, there has been an escalation of claims in the
West that the foreigners were being mistreated. Iraqi officials
have denied the claims and said that all the foreigners were given
adequate food and medical treatment.
   Information Minister Latif Jassim said President Bush was using
claims of mistreatment as a pretext for an attack on Iraq.
   The visits on Friday were meant to demonstrate that the hostages
are well treated.
   ``The food is decent. I eat well and I'm treated well,'' said a
second American, Charles Keegan, 56, an investment strategist who
worked three years for the Kuwaiti Investment Co.
   But Keegan said he had been rounded up on Sept. 19 and had since
been kept against his will.
   Keegan's hometown was not available.
   All 10 foreigners seen said they had been given good treatment.
But they disputed the wisdom of Iraq holding them to deter war,
saying that neither Bush nor British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher would be deterred.
   Briton Frank Graham said Mrs. Thatcher would fight a war despite
the fact that hundreds of British citizens were taken hostage into
a number of strategic sites in Iraq.
   ``If she wants to bomb, she will bomb, whether we are here or
not,'' said Graham, 49, who was working as an engineer more than
four years for the Kuwaiti Minsitry of Electricity and Water.
   The foreign hostages said they received messages from their
families over the BBC and the Voice of America radio.
   ``The BBC messages keep us sane. Without them, we could not have
heard anything from them,'' said Leon Corral, 45, another British
hostage.
   Iraqi officials at the site said that they arranged for the
hostages to send and receive letters from their families, and
accused authorities in Britain and the United States of blocking
the mail.
   The Japanese hostages said they receive food and medical
supplies from their embassy in Baghdad and expressed hope that
former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone might be able to
release some of them when he visits Baghdad over the weekend.
   Sercho Saisso, regional manager of Japanese Airways, said he was
arrested in Kuwait and moved to Baghdad with about 200 other
Japanese who have been relocated at different strategic sites.
   Saisso said his embassy sends Japanese food for fellow nationals
being held.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Slovak premier, who has warned
that his republic may secede from Czechoslovakia, has postponed a
visit to Hungary because of ethnic tension at home, a news agency
reported Friday.
   Later, the Slovak governing coalition's interior minister, Anton
Andras, resigned. He left under pressure from Slovak Premier
Vladimir Meciar, who had accused his political rival of
incompetene.
   The state CTK news agency quoted Frantisek Miklosko, president
of the Slovak parliament, as announcing postponement of the trip to
Hungary. ``Due to the newest political development in the Slovak
republic, we have officially apologized to the Hungarian
representatives yesterday and asked them to postpone the visit to
an unspecified date.''
   Miklosko was to accompany the premier on a three-day visit to
Hungary beginning Friday.
   Meciar, the premier, warned recently that nationalists might
declare Slovak independence from Czechoslovakia on Nov. 17, the
first anniversary of street unrest that culminated in the toppling
of Communist rulers in this Eastern European country.
   The postponement of Meciar's visit to Hungary came a week after
nationalist protesters in Bratislava, the Slovak capital, demanded
the republican government's resignation and Parliament's
dissolution.
   The nationalists oppose recent legislation permitting Slovakia's
estimated 500,000 ethnic Hungarians to use their language in areas
where they comprise at least 20 percent of the population.
   Some analysts suggested, however, that the trip has been
canceled because of the political rivalry between Meciar and his
interior minister.
   Meciar belongs to Public Against the Violence, which played a
key role in orchestrating the overthrow of the Communists. Andras
is a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Movement, the
junior Slovak government coalition partner of Public Against
Violence.
   Milosko announced on state television that Slovak Vice Premier
Jan Carnogursky will act as interim leader of the interior
ministry.

<HEAD>Judge Admits Secretly Dating Key Witness in Drug Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge is under investigation after
admitting she secretly dated a police officer, whom she later
married, while he was a key prosecution witness in a drug case she
handled.
   Municipal Judge Irene Takahashi said Thursday she didn't reveal
her affair with El Cerrito officer Michael Ramirez but said she
should have before presiding over an October 1989 preliminary
hearing.
   Takahashi said she realized failure to disclose the relationship
deprived Alberto Torrez and Luis Lozano of their constitutional
right to a fair and impartial hearing.
   The revelations came in an agreement Takahashi reached with
attorneys for the two men, who are charged with selling cocaine.
   Takahashi's attorney, Ephraim Margolin, said his client entered
the agreement to avoid a lengthy inquiry into impropriety charges.
He said it was premature to discuss the impact her conduct would
have on her career.
   The Commission on Judicial Performance is investigating
Takahashi, said visiting Judge Julie Conger of the Berkeley-Albany
Municipal Court, who is now handling the drug case.
   The original charges against the men were dismissed in April
after defense attorney Linda Fullerton challenged the propriety of
Takahashi presiding over the preliminary hearing.
   The case has been refiled and the defense is trying to have it
thrown out a second time. The defense maintains the district
attorney's office should be disqualified for its handling of the
first attempt to dismiss the case.
   Fullerton and Deputy Public Defender Oscar Bobrow are charging
government misconduct in the prosecutors' failure to investigate
whether Takahashi and Ramirez were dating at the time of the
hearing.
   Deputy District Attorney Nancy Georgiou said Ramirez also is
being investigated for misconduct for allegedly lying about when he
and Takahashi became involved.
   The two were engaged in December 1989 and married in September.
   Ramirez initially told the district attorney's office and his
supervisor that the affair began after the preliminary hearing. He
later admitted he was dating the judge at the time.

<TEXT>
   Switzerland on Friday eported its
first case of mad cow disease, which has already killed thousands
of Britain's cattle and prompted some countries to ban British
beef.
   The Swiss Economics Ministry said it would ban exports of
infected or suspicious beef only if more cases are found.
   The first case was diagnosed Friday in the brain of a cow from
northwestern Switzerland that was slaughtered in July, officials
said.
   There is no evidence humans can catch the disease, which is
transmitted among animals through feed and excrement, the statement
said.
   Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, as the disease is formally
known, attacks a cow's brain and central nervous system, leaving
tissue spongy. Afflicted cattle foam at the mouth and cannot stand
or walk normally.
   Infections in Britain last summer led European Community
countries and other governments to ban imports of British cattle
and beef. Some of the bans have since been lifted.
   The disease is believed to have spread to the British cows when
bones of sheep, which are susceptible to a similar disease, were
ground as a supplement in cattle feed. To curb the spread, the
British government in September banned the use of brain, spinal
cord and other cattle offal in animal feed and pet food.
   The British government has said more than 18,000 cattle died
from the disease in the last four years.

   A federal appeals court said Friday that the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission went too far in attempting to
streamline the licensing of future atomic power plants.
   The unanimous decision by the three-judge panel of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was a victory
for anti-nuclear groups that had argued the NRC's streamlining
amounted to the public not having adequate say in the licensing of
such plants.
   The court specifically said a ``one-step'' licensing scheme
under the NRC regulations, which would allow a power plant operator
to get both a construction and operating permit as part of a single
proceeding, violated the Atomic Energy Act.
   The NRC issued its new licensing regulations last year as part
of an attempt to simplify the licensing process and reduce
uncertainties and delays for atomic plant operators. The action
immediately was challenged in court by the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service and the Union of Concerned Scientists.
   ``It's disappointing,'' said NRC spokesman Joe Fouchard. ``We've
attempted to craft a rule which provides for early decision
making.''
   Fouchard said the commission would have to examine the court
ruling more closely before deciding on a next step.
   The court upheld some parts of the NRC regulation including
early site approval and standardization of reactor design.
   But it said that while some combining of the construction and
operational permits may be allowed, the commission must hold a
second round of hearings after construction is complete, before an
operating permit can be issued.
   Under previous licensing procedures, the commission held formal
hearings on construction and then began the procedures again before
issuing a permit for actual operation. The streamlined regulations
would not have required a second round of hearings.
   The three-judge panel said the Atomic Energy Act clearly
requires the second round of formal hearings so the NRC may
``consider significant new information that comes to light'' during
and after the construction phase.
   The nuclear and electric power industries for years have
campaigned for ways to speed up the licensing process for nuclear
plants. The process can easily take a dozen years or more under
current procedures.
   ``The court's decision makes clear that the NRC does not have
the right to remove the public from the reactor licensing process
(by not having a second hearing after construction),'' said Michael
Mariotte, executive director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service.
   Robert Pollard of the Union of Concerned Scientists said the
decision supports the argument that some issues cannot be resolved
in a single hearing before construction of a reactor even begins.
   The opinion was written by Chief Judge Patricia Wald. The other
two panel members were Circuit Judge David B. Sentelle and Circuit
Judge Clarence Thomas.

   The revenge wasn't slick but it was sweet when
Texas voters broadcast their version of ``America's Funniest Home
Videos'' - homemade parodies of the bitter gubernatorial race
between Clayton Williams and Ann Richards.
   For the last year, Texans have been bombarded with poll results,
slip-ups and million-dollar mudslinging during what some say is the
nastiest race for the governor's office in recent memory.
   Dallas' public television station, KERA, decided it wasn't going
to take it anymore and turned its airwaves over to viewers for 30
minutes this week in what they called ``Voters' Revenge.''
   The program featured 12 of the best submitted homemade video
parodies and skits of the gubernatorial race between Richards, the
Democrat, and Williams, the Republican.
   In Irwin Arnstein's video, the 31-year-old computer programmer
imitated Williams during a campaign ad. ``Yes folks, I plan to
service Texas,'' Arnstein said, referring to William's admission to
being ``serviced by prostitutes'' as a young boy.
   `If you elect me, there's nothing for you to do but sit back and
enjoy it,'' the video continued, referring to a comment Williams
made in March comparing bad weather and rape.
   ``If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it, '' Williams told
reporters.
   In another video, voters were asked to compare Williams to an
animal. Examples included rooster, weasel, jackass, piranha and
ostrich.
   The recording quality resembled homemade 8mm movies - nothing
like that of ads run by Richards and Williams, who have spent a
record-breaking $32 million on the campaign.
   Some ads were corny, like a spoof sent in by Alicia Plaski
featuring a rewritten Clement C. Moore's ``'Twas The Night Before
Christmas'':
   ``Twas the week before the election and all through the state,
the voters were waiting for just one debate.
   `` ... The voters were all snuggled al warm in their beds,
while visions of gas hikes danced in their heads. ''
   Most videos poked more fun at Williams, whose west Texas bravado
has resulted in several statements he later retracted.
   But video directors say that's because there's more material.
   ``Well, Ann Richards has done nothing to offend anybody whereas
Clayton William ... they had plenty of ammunition,'' Arnstein said.
``It was like hitting the broad side of a barn with a two by
four.''
   One segment titled ``Hot Talk'' featured controversial Dallas
disc jockey John Ford, of radio station KDGE, playing a sleazy talk
show host.
   In the video, created by KDGE intern Jeff Ballew, Ford
interviewed the two ``candidates from hell.''
   The ``Satan Williams'' character, played by Ballew, sported a
cowboy hat and devil's horns. If elected, he promised viewers a
``Satan Williams' Deluxe Detention Center and Family Theme Park.''
Meanwhile, a much younger looking ``Sat-Ann Richards,'' capped in a
large curly white wig, told voters she once dated Elvis.
   Ballew, 28 and a sophomore at North Lake Community College, says
he last voted in a governor's race, but was unsure of the date.
   Another Williams imitator joked that women's rights was a
contradiction in terms. His campaign promises included sending all
teen-agers caught smoking marijuana ``to hell.''
   Since the program aired Wednesday, viewer response has been
``mostly positive,'' said Jonnie England, KERA spokeswoman. About
15 viewers complained at the satirical portraits of Williams. But
others said they enjoyed the break from the usual election
coverage.
   It was not known whether the candidates were offended by the
parodies.
   ``I have no time to watch it,'' said Gordon Hensley, a Williams
spokesman.
   Margaret Justus, a spokeswoman for Richards said: ``We haven't
seen it because we don't have time to look at these things.''
   In one video, a three-piece band called The Tenner Shoe River
Boys presented their version of the theme from the ``The Beverly
Hillbillies'' show.
   ``Well the next thing you know, ol' Clay's a millionaire.
   His kinfolks said: `Hey Clay, Austin's over there.'
   ... Now he's in the runnin' with a lady Democrat.
   Says, `I'll be a gentleman and always tip my hat.'
   Tries to pass hisself off as a sensitive dude,
   But out from his mouth comes a bubblin' crude.
   Words that is, prostitute.
   Getting serviced. Lie back and enjoy it.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge's ruling that a state
child abuse list fails to provide due process could result in
compensation for more than 200,000 people on the computerized
registry, a lawyer said Friday.
   ``This could turn into a fairly expensive proposition,'' said
Ronald Meyer, an attorney for the Florida Teaching
Profession-National Education Association.
   He filed a class-action lawsuit challenging parts of the Florida
Abuse Registry in April.
   Although the suit is still pending, an order by U.S. District
Judge Maurice Paul ``takes probably 90 percent of the plaintiffs'
claims and decides it in their favor,'' Meyer said.
   But Steve Konicki, spokesman for the state Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services, said the agency was seriously
considering appealing the six-page order filed Tuesday.
   In the order, Paul said Florida law ``does not provide any
procedural safeguards or due process'' for people who are named in
the 211,000 ``indicated'' reports of abuse on the statewide
registry.
   The computer list was used for screening job applicants for day
care centers, camps, nursing homes or other state-run centers that
offered care for the young, elderly or handicapped.
   The list was compiled by reports, often anonymous, through
hotlines and from others such as teachers who suspected child
abuse. After the Health and Rehabilitative Services conducted an
investigation, it would deem the alleged abuse to be ``unfounded,''
``indicated,'' which means there's a possibiltiy of abuse but no
proof, or ``confirmed.''
   Some school administrators were listed for spanking students.
   Teachers, parents and others who are named in an ``indicated''
report of abuse of either a child, an elderly person or a disabled
person have no way of appealing, the judge noted. Their names are
retained for seven years.
   ``Nobody should be on this,'' Meyer said. ``This is America -
you're not guilty by suspicion. You should either be proven guilty
of wrongdoing - in which case let HRS keep your name on a computer
- or your name should be cleared and not retained on any computer
or anywhere else.''
   Paul upheld the way the state handles ``confirmed'' cases of
abuse, a process that was changed by the Legislature this year.
   Paul has yet to certify the lawsuit as a class action, and the
amount of damages that would be sought on behalf of the thousands
of people named has not yet been calculated, Meyer said.
   ``The hundreds of thousands of class members ought to be able to
receive (something) as a sort of blanket compensation for what
they're going through,'' Meyer said.
   He said the bulk of the 200,000 people named in the indicated
reports are probably parents but also lists teachers, nursing home
employee and day care workers.

   A foot of snow fell Friday in parts of Wyoming, Utah and
Colorado. The Great Lakes region basked in summer-like conditions.
   A cold front advanced across the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley overnight. Afternoon temperatures dipped 25 to
35 degrees in parts of Minnesota, South Dakota and Nebraska,
dropping into the teens and 20s.
   In contrast, temperatures were in the 60s and 70s from the Great
Lakes through southern New England south through the Ohio,
Mississippi and Tennessee valleys, the mid-Atlantic states and the
southern Plains. Some areas in the Gulf Coast region were in the
80s.
   Record high temperatures for the date included 72 in Alpena,
Mich., 71 in Green Bay, Wis., and 67 in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.
   Snow blanketed the central Rockies northeast to western parts of
the northern Plains. Up to 12 inches of snow fell in Wyoming,
including 9 inches at Lander.
   In South Dakota, between 1 and 2 inches of snow fell over wide
areas. Four inches fell at Hill City and 5 inches of snow fell near
Custer.
   In northern Utah, Alta had at least 13 inches of new snow. In
southern Utah, 6 inches fell at Cedar City.
   Colorado's first major snowstorm of the season hit the San Juan
mountains Friday with up to 10 inches of snow, prompting imposition
of the chain law for motorists.
   Thunderstorms rumbled through southeast Arizona and western New
Mexico.
   Snow dusted the higher elevations of central Arizona. Up to 5
inches fell in the mountains of western and northern New Mexico.
   High pressure over the Carolinas continued to bring warm and
windy weather to the southern Plains, the middle Mississippi Valley
and the central and eastern Great Lakes.
   Heavier snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 9 inches at Lander, Wyo., 6 inches at Casper, Wyo., and 5
inches at Gallup, N.M.

<HEAD>Rooney Says He's Pulled Back Since `60 Minutes' Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Humorist Andy Rooney said Friday he has tempered
his commentary since being suspended from ``60 Minutes,'' in one
case shelving plans to criticize a gift to the United Negro College
Fund because he didn't want to be branded a racist.
   ``I have pulled back some. (The suspension) was a chilling
experience,'' Rooney said at a meeting of the Associated Press
Managing Editors.
   Rooney, whose humorous essays have closed CBS-TV's ``60
Minutes'' programs for 12 years, was suspended for three weeks
without pay in February because of statements attributed to him in
a magazine for gays. Rooney denied he made the comments.
   The experience, however, caused Rooney to decide against
criticizing a $50 million gift to the college fund. The March
donation by publishing tycoon Walter Annenberg is the largest ever
for black colleges.
   Rooney said he had planned to criticize the gift in his
newspaper column as well as his television commentary, but, ``I
pulled back because I was chilled. I did not want to be known as a
racist.''
   Rooney said he still believes it is inconsistent to support
all-black or all-female institutions, while criticizing their
all-white, or all-male counterparts.
   Rooney said he had decided not to air the critique on the advice
of ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Ed Bradley, who is black, and
others, including executives of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   He also decided against the critique because he was afraid of
losing his audience.
   ``Like all of us, I hold the hope that I would influence the
world, and you have to decide on the best way to do that,'' he
said. ``You would lose every good affect you would have had.''
   Rooney also criticized network television news operations.
   ``The network news organizations are not what they were,'' he
said. ``I feel badly about the people who left newspapers for
television.''
   As an example, Rooney said news producers sent reporters off
``to stand in front of camels, or minarets, or temples'' to read
words written in New York.
   ``If anybody's looking for a reporter, I think I'm ready to get
out of TV,'' he said.
   ``I'm not comfortable being a famous person,'' he said. ``I'm
rude and I don't want to be grabbed on the street'' by strangers
seeking autographs.

<HEAD>Iraqi Jailed for Trying to Frame Two Kuwaiti Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday jailed a former employee of the
Kuwaiti embassy for falsely accusing two Kuwaiti women of drugging
him and stealing $15,600.
   Witnesses told the court that Mohammed Ajeel, 38, an Iraqi
citizen and employee at the Kuwaiti embassy in London, became
infatuated with one of the women early this year.
   He had been assigned to interpret for the woman when she visited
London, where her daughter was being treated at London's St.
Thomas's Hospital.
   On March 28, Ajeel declared to detectives that the 28-year-old
woman and her friend, a 25-year-old student, had drugged him and
stolen the money.
   ``Eventually he broke down and admitted the allegations were
completely false,'' said prosecutor Robert Hardy.
   Police said Ajeel told them: ``This woman has been driving me
mad, and I cannot sleep. I was completely obsessed by her. I was
blind to everything, except my desire to keep her here. I just had
to make up this story.''
   The women returned to Kuwait after being questioned by British
police in the case. Their names were not made public court because
they are in hiding in Kuwait and fear retribution by Iraqis who
have since invaded their homeland.
   Ajeel was jailed for six month by the Old Bailey, London's
central criminal court. He pleaded guilty to trying to obstruct
justice.

   William French Smith, who was U.S.
attorney general from 1981 to 1985 and a member of Ronald Reagan's
``kitchen cabinet,'' was eulogized Friday by his old boss as a man
worth listening to.
   ``For more than two decades, Nancy's and my life was enriched,
yes, blessed, by William French Smith,'' Reagan said. ``When he
spoke he made sense, and when he spoke, I listened.''
   Reagan and others eulogized Smith during a one-hour service
attended by 250 people at San Marino Community Church.
   Smith was 73 when he died of cancer Monday at the University of
Southern California's Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital.
   The memorial service came a day after Smith was interred during
a private service at Forest Lawn Glendale, said his son-in-law, Lee
Lorenzen.
   Born Aug. 26, 1917, in Wilton, N.H., Smith served as a Navy
officer during World War II. As a managing partner of the Los
Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, he specialized in
corporate relations with labor.
   As attorney general, Smith oversaw the breakup of AT&amp;T and the
deregulation of airlines.
   ``Bill ... believed firmly in limited government and keeping
government as close to the people as possible,'' said U.S.
Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr in his eulogy.
   Starr, who served under Smith in Washington, described Smith's
interests in the ``far reaches of the Department of Justice,''
including his visits to Cambodian refugee camps in eastern Thailand
and anti-drug efforts in Pakistan, Peru and Bolivia.
   Reagan's personal attorney and investment advisor, Smith was
also informal chairman of the ``kitchen cabinet'' that helped usher
Reagan into the California governor's mansion and the White House.
   ``It was the source of the greatest comfort to have a friend
from home at the Cabinet table,'' Reagan said.
   ``We really lost a good pal, he was the best,'' said
entertainment industry producer Merv Griffin.
   A eulogy also was delivered by Charles Z. Wick, former director
of the U.S. Information Agency.
   Also in attendance were former Attorney General Edwin Meese III,
Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., Eva Gabor and filmmaker Jerry
Weintraub.
   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh was addressing the
United Nations General Assembly in New York and could not attend
the service, said Starr.
   Smith is survived by his wife, Jean; sons William French Smith
III, Scott Cameron Smith, Gregory Hale Smith; daughter, Stephanie
Smith Lorenzen; stepson G. William Vaughan Jr.; stepdaughter Merry
Vaughan Dunn; and seven grandchildren.

<HEAD>Mexican Activists Release German Diplomat Held Hostage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAXACA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political activists on Friday freed a
German consular agent they held hostage for five days. In exchange,
the government promised to review the case of a jailed colleague of
the kidnappers, the diplomat said.
   In Mexico City, members of the same activist group also ended a
hunger strike begun Sept. 17 to push for their comrade's release,
the Excelsior news service said. They were reportedly told they
could discuss the case with authorities.
   ``I'm just happy I got out,'' the German official, Wolfgang
Wilczek, said by telephone a few minutes after his release.
   Wilczek was at the consular office in Oaxaca, 250 miles
southeast of Mexico City, on Monday when five unarmed members of
the National Independent Committee moved in and took over the
facility. The 11-year-old group is also known as the Independent
Committee for the Defense of Prisoners, Persecuted, Disappeared and
Political Exiles.
   The five took Wilczek hostage to pressure the Mexican government
to release a member of their organization jailed in connection with
the fatal shootings in April of two newspaper security guards in
Mexico City. They claim Felipe Martinez Soriano, a former rector of
Oaxaca's Benito Juarez Autonomous University, was illegally
arrested.
   Oaxaca state Interior Secretary Ildefonso Zorilla assured in
negotiations with the hostage-takers' group that the government
would review the legal procedures used in the case, Wilczek said.
He sat in on the talks that led to his release.
   Zorilla also promised the hostage-takers they would not be
prosecuted for the kidnapping, Wilczek said. He said the group left
his office with Zorilla and reporters.
   Wilczek said the kidnappers treated him well at first, but at
midweek cut off his food and propped him in a chair behind the
office door as a shield against any police intervention.

   Iraqi troops captured three French soldiers on a
reconnaissance patrol this week near the Saudi Arabian border with
Iraq, the Defense Ministry reported Friday. They were later freed.
   The soldiers, who were taken captive Monday, were turned over to
the French Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq's capital, the Defense Ministry
said in a communique.
   It was unclear whether the incident occurred inside Iraqi
territory or in Saudi Arabia.
   A ministry spokesman said later Friday that the soldiers face
disciplinary measures for an ``act of carelessness,'' which
suggests the incident was on the Iraqi side of the border.
   The ministry initially reported the capture occurred northwest
of Hafar el Batin, a desert city in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
Hafar el Batin is about 5 miles inside Saudi Arabia. Attempts to
reconcile the different locales were not immediately availing.
   A French Defense Ministry source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the captured soldiers ``committed an error of
exceeding their mission. There's a lot of movement around the
border right now, and we don't know exactly what happened. The
commander who has opened the investigation believes they are
responsible.''
   About 13,000 French forces, including Foreign Legionnaires, are
among the more than 200,000 multinational troops assembled in the
Persian Gulf region to face off against Iraq, which invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2. Iraq has about 430,000 troops in Kuwait and near the
Saudi border.
   The Iraqi patrol surprised the French soldiers, who committed no
``hostile act,'' the ministry said.
   The three were taken to Baghdad and turned over to the French
charge d'affaires, the communique said.
   Other military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the trio was composed of one officer and two non-commissioned
officers in an all-terrain vehicle.
   French forces are scattered around strategic crossroads near the
Saudi-Iraqi border, the sources said, but are under strict orders
not to get too close to the frontier.
   Saudi military commanders, who have overall authority over the
multinational forces in their country, are aware of the incident,
the ministry said.
   The French army has opened an investigation of the incident and
``will draw all the consequences,'' the communique said.
   The name of the regiment that the soldiers came from was not
disclosed.
   The incident occurred the same day that an Iraqi Airways
jetliner flew 262 French and 17 other Western hostages to freedom
in Paris after nearly three months' captivity in Iraq and occupied
Kuwait.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, the
couple who claimed their infant daughter was spirited off by a
dingo in the Australian outback, are planning to divorce, a
newspaper said Saturday.
   The marriage fell victim to the strains of fighting for more
than nine years to clear their names, the Sydney Morning Herald
said.
   The couple claimed in August 1980 that their daughter Azaria was
carried away by a dingo, an Australian wild dog, from the tent
where they were camping in central Australia near Ayer's Rock.
   The child's body was never recovered. In 1981, Lindy Chamberlain
was charged and later convicted of her daughter's murder. She spent
3{ years in prison but was released after new evidence was
discovered - a piece of clothing that indicated a dingo might
indeed have taken the child.
   The infant's disappearance, one of the most hotly disputed
criminal cases in Australia's history, was the subject of a
Hollywood movie ``A Cry in the Dark,'' starring Meryl Streep as
Lindy Chamberlain.
   The newspaper said the couple is still living together at their
home north of Sydney and that it has not been decided who will have
custody of their three remaining children.
   Lindy Chamberlain is in New Zealand on a nine-day trip to
promote her book, ``Through My Eyes.''

<TEXT>
   Blacks and Cuban-Americans are at it again in this
city where bad ethnic relations seldom get a rest.
   This time, blacks are outraged at the appointment of a Cuban
school superintendent in the nation's fourth largest school
district.
   A 53-year-old veteran black administrator who twice served as
interim chief was passed over to promote 39-year-old Octavio
Visiedo. Dade County Superintendent Paul Bell died of a heart
attack Oct. 16 after eight months on the job.
   Some blacks reacted to the appointment by calling for a
county-wide boycott by black students and workers on election day,
hoping to draw attention to charges of inbred racism in the city's
power structure.
   ``Miami is the Selma (Ala.) of the 1990s,'' said Ray Fauntroy,
head of the Miami-Dade Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. ``It deserves the negative publicity that it gets.''
   Black leaders called Friday for the black community to vote on
election day. Some were afraid a black boycott might be
misinterpreted as a call to stay away from the polls.
   ``We know that Tuesday, Nov. 6 is D-Day for us,'' said state
Sen. Carrie Meek, D-Miami. ``We want people to turn out in numbers
like they've never turned out.''
   The city had hoped to recover from the negative image of four
race riots in the 1980s, spurred by anger over police shootings.
   The indignant blacks are looking to recall the five school board
members who voted Visiedo into the superintendent's seat last week.
   They say they will attempt to recall Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez
and all four city commissioners for this summer's official snub of
Nelson Mandela after Mandela made kind comments about Fidel Castro.
The Mandela incident sparked a 4-month-old boycott of Miami hotels
by some national black organizations.
   Visiedo, a deputy administrator who has been with the school
system for 17 years, was selected over the black community's first
choice, Tee S. Greer. He's a black educator with a doctorate who
has been with the district for three decades, twice as interim
school chief.
   Although Visiedo has less experience than Greer, school board
members said he had impressed them in recent months. He was
overseeing the district's finance and business management
operations, including a $1.56 billion construction program,
considered a top priority in the district.
   School Board members praise Greer as a competent,
well-credentialed administrator, but they cite the decisive style
and ``dynamism'' Visiedo displays, despite his relative
inexperience.
   Greer repeatedly has called for calm and is opposed to the
boycott.
   ``I know they hurt,'' he said of the angry black community. ``I
would prefer they do something other than keep children out of
school.''
   The decision was important for the school board in Dade County,
where innovative schools have become a hallmark since the
administration of Joseph Fernandez, who is now school
superintendent in New York City.
   Black leaders say Greer was passed over on Oct. 24 because of
his race and that Visiedo's appointment further tips the imbalance
between Cubans and blacks in positions of power.
   Dade County public school officials say 46 percent of their
295,000 students are Hispanic, 33 percent are black and 19.8
percent are white.
   ``His selection was purely political and racial,'' said the Rev.
Richard Dunn, who headed up the black ministers call for the
boycott.
   Dunn and the Rev. Victor Curry used their call-in talk show on a
black-oriented radio station to announce the boycott. At least
seven other prominent black ministers have joined, said Dunn.
   ``We want to expose the blatant racism that persists here in
Dade County,'' said Dunn.
   Although Greer and some black leaders say the boycott would only
hurt the students, others believe it it will serve as a badly
needed civil rights lesson for black kids.
   ``It's more than symbolic - we're going to give them a lesson in
life,'' said Dunn. ``They did more damage to the children last week
than we're going to do to them in one day.''
   Visiedo prefers to see the boycott movement as a display of
affection for Greer rather than an anti-Cuban statement.
   ``We inside the system perceive it as a display of concern and
affection for a person who has served his community for many, many
years,'' Visiedo said. ``I share the concerns of all educators in
this county, black, white and Hispanic - that is that we want our
kids in school.''

   Skeletal remains were found Friday that were
believed to be those of a former Haitian slave under consideration
for sainthood, a medical examiner said.
   ``I'm sure we have his body,'' said Dr. Millard J. Hyland, chief
medical examiner for Westchester County.
   Roman Catholic Church officials hesitated to say whether two
days of digging at a small cemetery in the Little Italy section of
Manhattan succeeded until the remains of two adults found in the
grave of Pierre Toussaint can be studied.
   ``They didn't come out of the ground in one piece,'' Hyland
said.
   No caskets were found in the grave, which is believed to contain
the bodies of Toussaint, his wife and his niece. It is believed
they were buried in wooden caskets, which would have disintegrated.
   Toussaint was buried at Old St. Patrick's Church Cemetery after
his death in 1853 at age 87.
   As a preliminary part of the church's inquiry into his life so
that he can be considered for sainthood, his skeletal remains were
sought and will be moved to St. Patrick's Cathedral. They
eventually would be distributed in Haiti and prominent churches if
the church makes him a saint.
   Church leaders and doctors standing by the grave were
disappointed Thursday when only fragments of a few bones were
found. They were believed to be mostly animal bones.
   On Friday, workers, sometimes digging with their hands, found
two slightly overlapping skeletons 8 to 9 feet beneath the ground.
   ``I was expecting nothing,'' Hyland said. ``Bones are sturdy but
they don't last forever. I'm surprised to find two intact
skeletons.''
   He said the remains of one of the bodies was apparently that of
a black person, but the other could not immediately be determined.
He said he would wait for anthropologists and pathologists to
determine the gender of each.
   The remains were taken into Old St. Patrick's Church, where they
will be assembled and studied in a process that will last weeks.
Digging at the grave was essentially concluded, church officials
said.
   Monsignor Robert O'Connell said the skull of one of the bodies
obviously belonged to an older person because the jaw bones and
teeth were worn down and there were cavities in the teeth.
   ``These are definitely not children,'' he said.
   Toussaint was born a slave in Haiti in 1766 and moved to New
York with his owner's family in 1787. After becoming a hairdresser,
he was allowed to keep some of his income and used it to support
his owner's wife and child for 20 years after his owner died.
   The widow freed Toussaint from slavery shortly before she died
in 1807.
   Church officials have said they hope Toussaint could be approved
for sainthood by the time Pope John Paul II visits Haiti in 1992 to
celebrate the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher
Columbus.

   Hyosuke Niwa, a former Japanese labor minister,
died Friday of heart failure caused by excessive bleeding at age
72, nearly two weeks after he was stabbed by a mental patient at a
military ceremony.
   Niwa, a 12-term member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party

   C.R. Roseberry, whose books documented the
histories of Albany, aviation and steamboats, died Thursday after a
brief illness at age 88.
   Roseberry's work as a reporter, critic and columnist at
newspapers in Albany, Ithaca, Buffalo and Rochester spanned five
decades. His column ``The Melting Pot'' appeared on the editorial
pages of the now defunct Knickerbocker News in the late 1930s.
   Among his books were ``Capitol Story,'' published in the 1960s.
Commissioned by the state Office of General Services, it told the
story of the more than three decades it took to construct the state
Capitol under numerous architects, governors, legislatures and
pressures.
   Roseberry also wrote ``The Challenging Skies,'' a history of
aviation from 1919 through 1939.
   His other works include ``Steamboats and Steamboat Men,'' ``Glen
Curtiss, Pioneer of Flight,'' and ``Albany: Three Centuries of a
County.''
   Roseberry is survived by two sons, several grandchildren and
great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>U.S. to Raise Nuclear Issue with New Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration said Friday it will
raise the question of nuclear weapons with Pakistan's new
government, a question that forced suspension of American aid last
month.
   ``We expect to engage the new Pakistani government early on in
discussion of these issues,'' said Assistant Secretary of State
John Kelly. ``Meanwhile, we have complied with the law and
suspended all military assistance and new economic aid to
Pakistan,'' he told a Congressional panel.
   Before aid can be granted each year, the law requires the
president to certify to Congress each year that Pakistan does not
possess nuclear weapons. In the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, the
United States had planned $564 million for Pakistan.
   Chairman Stephen Solarz, D-NY, opened the hearing of the
Asia-Pacific subcommittee he chairs for the House Foreign Affairs
Committee with a blunt warning that ``neither the administration
nor Congress is prepared to turn a blind eye toward mounting
evidence that Pakistan persists in its pursuit of nuclear
weaponry.''
   Unless the new government takes steps to prove that it does not
have those arms, ``American law is quite clear, no further U.S.
assistance can flow to Pakistan,'' Solarz added.
   For U.S.-Pakistani relations to improve, he said, Pakistan must
undertake ``a genuine commitment to democracy, non-interference in
the affairs of Pakistan's neighbors and a new willingness to
address U.S. nuclear concerns.
   ``Within this framework, everything is possible, but without it,
we will have reached a parting of the ways.''
   Kelly said tension between India and Pakistan has eased in
recent months and the United States is ready to help the two
neighbors develop confidence-building measures, he said.
   ``It would indeed be ironic if our success in reducing the arms
race between the superpowers'' were offset by arms proliferation on
the Indian subcontinent.
   The continuing review of Pakistan's nuclear program is part of
such concern, Kelly said, citing a U.S. law, the Pressler
amendment, requiring the president to certify annually that
Pakistan does not possess a nuclear weapon. He confirmed that lack
of the certification when the new fiscal year started in October
prompted suspension of aid for Pakistan, planned by the
administration at $564 million for 1991.
   Kelly also said the United States intends to ``review all
available information'' in meeting another condition attached by
Congress to Pakistan's aid, that last month's parliamentary
election be certified as free and fair.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Peoples Party suffered a
landslide defeat in the balloting, and Ms. Bhutto charged wholesale
fraud.
   The newly elected assembly and the next government, to be formed
by the victorious right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance under
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, may be installed Saturday.
   Kelly said the administration accepts the preliminary finding of
a U.S.-organized international observer team that the election was
generally fair, but was marked by flaws and controversy that
probably did not affect the outcome.
   ``Hard and fast evidence regarding massive fraud has yet to be
documented and presented, but the process of collecting data that
would form the basis for such claims is now underway,'' said
Kenneth Wollack, executive vice president of the international arm
of the U.S. Democratic Party, which organized the 18-nation
observer team.
   Wollack testified that the team's preliminary report ``was not
intended as a certification of the elections, and the delegation
was quite careful in avoiding statements that could be seen as
suggesting such a conclusion.''

<HEAD>City Officials Settle $28 Million Civil Rights Suit for $50,000</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A $28 million civil rights lawsuit
filed against the city by Lenell Geter, an engineer who was wrongly
convicted of armed robbery eight years ago, was to be settled for
$50,000 under an agreement reached Friday.
   The Greenville City Council voted unanimously to settle the
case, which has haunted the east Texas town for eight years.
   ``The city contends that its actions never violated the rights
of Geter and the other plaintiffs,'' said Dianne Callander, city
attorney. ``But this situation ... has created, to my
understanding, a schism in the community.''
   Geter, who is black, was sentenced to life in prison in 1982 for
the armed robbery of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, even
though his co-workers at E-Systems, a defense contractor, testified
he was at work that day.
   An all-white Dallas County jury convicted Geter and he served 18
months before he was exonerated.
   U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders dismissed most of Geter's
claims against the city and its police department Aug. 14. The
claims against Greenville police Lt. Jim Fortenberry, who
originally implicated Geter in the robbery, were left intact.
   Geter's attorney, George Hairston, was unavailable for comment
Friday when contacted at his New York office.
   According to the settlement, which brings to an end the nearly
7-year-old lawsuit, the council does not admit liability of its own
or fault on the part of Fortenberry.
   Before the settlement, Geter's attorneys offered out-of-court
settlements of up to $1 million, which the city council rejected.
   Geter's case received national attention and was the subject of
a CBS ``60 Minutes'' story and a television movie.
   The settlement will come out of the city's general fund.

   Arkansas' top legal officer announced Friday
he will step down, effective Monday, because of his felony theft
conviction.
   ``Although my future at this point is not certain, that
uncertainty must not affect the office of the Attorney General,''
Steve Clark told reporters.
   ``Therefore I have decided it's in the state's best interest
that I resign as attorney general,'' he said.
   A jury convicted Clark on Thursday of felony theft by deception
and fined him $10,000. Clark maintained his innocence Friday. He
said he was discussing a possible appeal with his attorney.
   ``I want the people of Arkansas to know that I've made mistakes,
and I apologize for those mistakes, but I'm not guilty of theft by
deception,'' he said.
   The prosecutor in Clark's trial charged that the attorney
general used his state Visa card to prop up his gubernatorial
campaign and failing personal financial condition.
   Clark's attorney, Bill Bristow, argued Clark could use his state
Visa card in any way Clark saw fit.

   A man who was shot and injured by a judge Halloween
night when he allegedly tried to break into his house was once
convicted of double murder, but the conviction was overturned,
police said.
   Jeffrey Dale Parnell was convicted of murdering two drug dealers
and burying them in a sugarcane field, records showed. The victims
were robbed of money and drugs before they were shot in 1981.
   An appeals court reversed Parnell's conviction in October 1986,
saying statements made to key witnesses were improperly used as
evidence. The state dropped the charges because key witnesses
refused to cooperate in a new trial.
   Richard Barlow, the prosecutor in the murder case, said Thursday
Parnell had about 30 arrests and no convictions. His 21-page record
includes charges of kidnapping, involuntary sexual assault and
robbery with force.
   Parnell, 30, was shot in the stomach Wednesday with a .22
caliber pistol by Judge Harvey Baxter when he and another man
allegedly tried to break into the judge's home. The intruders wore
gorilla masks.
   The 60-year-old judge and his wife were not injured. Baxter
returned to the bench Thursday.
   Parnell was hospitalized in good condition Friday. He was
arrested at the hospital and charged with attempted murder, armed
burglary, aggravated battery and use of a firearm during the
commission of a felony.
   The second man remained at large.

   Millionaire Republican
gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams said Friday he didn't pay
any income taxes in 1986 because of the poor economy.
   Williams, who has refused repeated calls by his rival, Democrat
Ann Richards, to release his income tax returns, made the remark in
response to a reporter's question.
   ``Yes, I've paid lots of income tax, lots, lots,'' he said.
``I'll tell you when I didn't pay any income tax was 1986, when our
whole economy collapsed.''
   Bill Cryer, Richards' press secretary, said Williams' admission
shows why Williams has refused for months to make public his income
tax returns.
   ``Absolutely, it's no wonder he didn't want to release his
income tax (returns),'' Cryer said, adding that the Richards
campaign thinks Williams now needs to make all his recent returns
public as the Democrat did months ago.
   ``It is an absolute necessity now that we know whether or not
this man - who is one of the richest men in the United States -
paid any income taxes like the rest of us,'' Cryer said.
   ``In 1986, I can understand he was going through some hard
times. But everybody in Texas was. And we all paid our taxes
then,'' Cryer said.
   He said Richards' 1986 return showed she paid $47,343 in income
taxes on earnings of $154,000. That included her $68,000 state
salary, capital gains, $14,000 in interest income and a divorce
settlement.
   Williams' admission came during a whistlestop train trip from
San Antonio to Houston. He pledged to boost the state's economy,
veto any income tax and fight a war on drugs.
   Richards, campaigning with Missouri Congressman Richard Gephardt
in east Texas, accused Republicans of trying to intimidate black
voters and denounced the GOP as cynical.
   Two new opinion polls, meanwhile, showed the race continuing to
tighten as Tuesday's election.
   A Mason-Dixon poll conducted for various media outlets showed
Williams at 45 percent support and Richards at 43 percent. Another
poll showed the race at 42 percent for Williams to 35 percent for
Richards.
   Earlier in Longview, Richards called again for Williams to
release his income tax returns.
   ``I want to know if he paid income tax,'' she told about 200
people gathered at the Gregg County courthouse.
   ``You ought to be able to see whether or not someone who aspires
to lead this state cares enough about government to pay his fair
share in running the government,'' she said.

   American voters have been turned off by negative
campaigns this election year, former House Speaker Jim Wright said
Friday.
   Wright said he was disturbed fewer Americans vote in local,
state and national elections than people living in countries with
less of a democratic history.
   While about 90 percent of the potential voters in a country such
as Nicaragua will cast ballots, only 50 percent of qualified
American voters turn out here.
   ``The negative campaigns have gotten out of hand,'' Wright said
in a speech at the 56th annual convention of the Associated Press
Managing Editors. ``Some people have been turned off and have tuned
out. And that's just a damn shame.''
   The gubernatorial race has been marked by negative television
ads by Republican candidate Clayton Williams and his Democratic
opponent Ann Richards.
   Wright said he recently asked Richards why she didn't spend more
time talking about positive issues. He said Richards told him she
has talked about positive issues, discussing prison reform,
education and more jobs for Texans.
   ``Of course you don't know i because all you see or read in the
paper is some negative thing that I said about Clayton Williams,''
Wright said Richards told him.
   Wright also discussed what he said was another ``dangerous
trend'' - the rising cost of running for office. ``The cost of
campaigns has become obscene.''
   Wright said that he started his first congressional campaign in
1954 with $31,000 of his own money. With another $31,000 in
contributions he won the election.
   ``If a young man came to me today with $31,000 and asked my
advice, I would tell him that that wouldn't even be a start,''
Wright said. ``I would tell him he'd need about ten times that much
and that he should expect to spend 20 times that much.''
   Wright estimated the average cost to run for U.S. Senate in 1968
was $600,000. In 1988, the average rose to $1.7 million. Richards
and Williams have spent at least $32 million in the gubernatorial
race, he said.
   Many potentially good political candidates do not seek public
office because they don't have enough money, said Wright. He
suggested establishing an enforceable campaign spending limit of
$500,000 per candidate.
   APME is comprised of managing editors and other news executives
of the 1,500 member newspapers of the AP, the world's largest news
gathering organization.
   The four-day convention, which ended Friday, drew 263 editors
from across the nation.

   A top official, opening faltering talks on
overhauling global trade, warned Friday that the negotiations could
collapse entirely.
   ``While we still have everything to gain, the risk of losing
everything has never been so present,'' declared Arthur Dunkel,
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The Uruguay Round of talks, held under GATT's auspices, are
scheduled to conclude in a month with a ministerial meeting in
Brussels, Belgium.
   The 100-nation talks were launched in Uruguay four years ago in
an ambitious attempt to restructure world trade. They are aimed at
accords in 15 sectors, with the goal of reducing protectionism and
expanding trade by more than a trillion dollars.
   However, in his comments, Dunkel said progress has been
alarmingly slow. He said substantive talks on agriculture, the most
contentious issue of the discussions, have not even begun.
   Dunkel also said negotiators are far apart on textiles, banking,
and intellectual property rights like patents.
   The negotiations are being slowed particularly by a deadlock in
the 12-nation European Community over a plan to reduce agricultural
subsidies by 30 percent.
   The United States and the Cairns group of farm exporting
nations, led by Australia, say 30 percent is not enough. Argentina
has warned it will walk out of the talks if there is no
satisfactory agreement on slashing farm subsidies.
   Some European nations, including Germany and France, fear that
cutting subsidies would hurt their domestic farmers.

   Defending champion Garry Kasparov and challenger
Anatoly Karpov agreed to a draw Friday in the 10th game of the
world chess championship.
   The players agreed to the draw after Kasparov's 18th move. The
game lasted three hours and 12 minutes, by far the shortest so far
in the match.
   Each player had 4{ points after they agreed to a draw Wednesday
in the ninth game. Friday's draw gave them each another half-point,
bringing the match score to 5-5.
   Karpov had the advantage in Wednesday's game but blundered on
the 32nd move and lost a pawn. A few moves later, he offered a draw
and Kasparov immediately accepted.
   Grandmaster Maxim Dlugy called the Wednesday mistake ``the most
horrible blunder of this match.'' It was the third game in a row in
which one player or the other made a significant mistake.
   Kasparov and Karpov each have a victory and played to a draw
eight times, including Friday's game. A victory is worth a point, a
draw a half-point. The first player to gain 12{ points wins the
championship and $1.7 million of a $3 million purse.
   The first 12 games are being played in New York and the
remainder will be played in Lyons, France.

   Fast-food giant McDonald Corp.'s decision to
abandon foam packages won't put much of a dent in the plastics
industry, but it symbolizes America's growing discomfort with a
throw-away society, analysts said Friday.
   The clamshell-style containers for Big Macs, Quarter Pounders
and other sandwiches served at McDonald's 8,000 restaurants
nationwide account for less than 1 percent of the $5 billion-plus
market for polystyrene, says the Society of the Plastics Industry,
a Washington trade group.
   ``In itself this is not a major event,'' George Krug, an
industry analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said. ``But there's more to
be seen from it. People are going to be more conscious about their
packaging materials and that is an important market for the
plastics industry.''
   Disposable food-service packages represent roughly 20 percent of
the total polystyrene market, Krug said. Besides foam sandwich
boxes, food-related polystyrene products include plastic cutlery as
well as clear plastic goods like glasses.
   Polystyrene foam has been banned by several U.S. cities that say
it contributes to landfill problems by lingering for years before
disintegrating. The polystyrene production process also is
suspected of harming the Earth's protective ozone level.
   McDonald's said Thursday it will begin replacing foam sandwich
containers with paper products within 60 days. The company's main
competitor, Burger King, already uses lightweight paper boxes.
   McDonald's President Edward Rensi said the sandwich containers
account for nearly 75 percent of the company's total foam use.
McDonald's is still seeking suitable replacements for plastic
cutlery and plastic coffee cups.
   The immediate impact will be felt by the handful of McDonald's
suppliers, which include Amoco Foam Products Co., Mobil Corp.,
Jen-Pak and Huntsman Chemical.
   Container-maker Dolco Packaging Corp. of Wenatchee, Wash.,
expects business to drop more than 50 percent in the coming months
with the loss of McDonald as a customer.
   Brad Gothberg, a spokesman for Irwin Research and Development
Inc., a Yakima, Wash.-maker of the machines that make the clamshell
containers, said he expects some impact. He would not say how
severe.
   Karl Kamena, a spokesman for Dow Chemical Co., a major plastics
producer, said he didn't think the McDonald's move would have a
ripple effect. And he disputed the environmental threat posed by
the product, as have McDonald's executives themselves.
   ``People tend to forget that foam polystyrene is 95 percent
air,'' Kamena said. ``We've found a clever way of using air as a
package.''
   Kamena said the average American uses between three and four
pounds of polystyrene each year - the equivalent of up to 888 foam
cups.
   Besides fast-food containers, polystyrene is a main building
block for egg cartons; yogurt containers, which are a combination
of polystrene and rubber; hard, clear plastics like those that
contain compact discs; insulation; toilet seats and stereo and
television cabinets.
   Dart Container Corp., a Mason, Mich.-based company that operates
four polystyrene reprocessing centers, denounced McDonald's for
discouraging foam recycling, calling the decision an
``environmental fumble.''
   Dart Chairman W.A. Dart asserted that foam ``requires 30 percent
less energy than the energy needed simply to process paper
products.'' He said foam production ``generates 46 percent less
atmospheric emissions and contributes 42 percent fewer pollutants
to America's waterways than paper production.''
   McDonald's decision comes at a time when the plastics industry
is about to boost capacity to produce the raw materials essential
for making polystyrene, Krug said. Within the next two years,
global capacity is expected to expand by about 20 percent.
   ``There's going to be a bloodbath in terms of overcapacity,''
Krug said. ``That's not good from a supply-and-demand point of view
for the plastics companies.''
   McDonald's move, he said, ``whetted the appetite of consumer
advocates who say they can make a difference by bringing public
pressure on these people.''

Wellesley College experts on racial diversity.
   ``These obviously are issues which need attention and the
selectmen are committed not to lose sight of them,'' Selectmen
Barbara Shanahan said.
   Margolies, in a statement, called the agreement adequate to
settle any claims against the town.
   Brown, who is black, was sitting in a parked car Sept. 21 with
his fiancee, who is white, when at least five police officers
forced him from his car at gunpoint and told him to lie face down
on the pavement.
   Police said they believed him to be a suspect in the robbery of
a nearby bank. Within a few minutes, police realized they had the
wrong man, police said.
   The issued brought allegations of racism bubbling to the surface
of this mostly white, affluent Boston suburb.
   Brown, the Celtics' top draft choice this year, decided to go
ahead with plans to live in Wellesley.

<HEAD>Silber Calls Opponent `orange-headed WASP,' Nader Blasts Silber
Candidacy</HEAD>

   Democratic candidate for governor John Silber
described his opponent Friday as an ``orange-headed WASP.''
   GOP candidate William Weld brushed off the Silber comment about
his white Anglo-Saxon Protestant background.
   ``That doesn't bother me at all, that name,'' Weld said. ``He's
called me far worse.''
   Silber made the remark about Weld while urging reporters to
examine the Republican's public statements as closely as they
examine his.
   The media ``has a set of blinders on'' because they ``can't see
the shockers when they come from an orange-headed WASP,'' he said.
   Later, Silber characterized the remark as simply a description
of Weld.
   ``I think just as surely you can say, `the short, wiry
candidate,' or `the one-armed candidate, the candidate with the
withered arm running for governor,''' Silber said. ``I think that
would be an adequate substitute for `John Silber.' ''
   Meanwhile, consumer advocate Ralph Nader came to Boston to urge
voters to vote against Silber, calling him an ``authoritarian
personality.''
   Nader said he was not recommending votes for Weld, but believed
Silber's personality made him unsuited to be governor.
   ``Do the voters of Massachusetts, whose forebearers threw out
King George over 200 years ago, now want to elect a King John?''
Nader asked.
   Michal Regunberg, a Silber campaign spokeswoman, called Nader's
comment ``part of a deliberate smear tactic.''
   Nader, who is traveling around the country to discuss campaign
issues, also appeared in Los Angeles on Friday to urge voters to
reject Republican California attorney general candidate Dan
Lungren.

<HEAD>Daily News Union Leader Asks Jesse Jackson to Mediate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Daily News' striking unions
asked the Rev. Jesse Jackson on Friday to act as a mediator and he
said he would help in any way he could.
   Labor lawyer Theodore Kheel later amended the request by Allied
Printing Trades Council President George McDonald by saying Jackson
could potentially mediate on one issue common to all nine striking
unions - the right of strikers to return to their jobs.
   ``We're very bullish on his becoming involved in this one
issue,'' said Kheel, an adviser to the unions.
   Jackson said he would be willing ``to offer my services in
whatever way would be effective.''
   News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson had no immediate comment on
Jackson's offer to mediate or on the content of his meeting earlier
Friday with News publisher James Hoge. Jackson said Hoge had
indicated a willingness to negotiate.
   Eight of the News' 10 unions went on strike Oct. 25, joined a
day later by the Newspaper Guild, over what they term unfair labor
practices. They have negotiated fruitlessly since January over
contracts that expired in March.
   The front of a store sellinge newspaper's 350
editorial employees have crossed picket lines and another 40
reporters have been hired from other newspapers in the region.
   Jackson spoke at a rally in front of the Daily News Building
that police said was attended by an estimated 3,500 people.
   ``We must stand for the right of the American people to have a
job, and to get paid, and to have health care,'' he said. ``We
choose negotiation over confrontation, but dignity and job security
above all.''
   Jackson warned non-union replacement workers: ``Beware, if you
take someone's $10 job today, there's an $8 crowd waiting for you
tomorrow.''
   The News claimed in a letter that striking craft unions have
excluded women and minorities and questioned why Jackson ``would
choose to endorse or align himself with six lily-white craft unions
whose membership rolls are strictly closed to blacks and females.''
   The News said it printed and distributed 1.06 million copies of
Friday's newspaper.
   A source at a rival newspaper, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said its tracking of the News' circulation showed that
the News may have sold 285,000 to 295,000 papers Friday. Another
industry source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
estimated that just 400,000 to 500,000 copies were sold.

<TEXT>
   For the first time in decades, votes in
the Minnesota governor's race will be cast on paper ballots. That
means results probably won't be known until Wednesday morning.
   On Friday, the secretary of state's office directed the printing
of supplementary paper ballots for the governor's race. The ballot
was determined Thursday, when the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled
that Joanell Dyrstad and not Sharon Clark will be Republican Arne
Carlson's runningmate.
   Election judges aren't thrilled about the prospect of counting
the separate gubernatorial ballots into the wee hours on Wednesday.
   ``It will take an extra three or four hours,'' predicted Joan
Pelzer, the Ramsey County election supervisor. ``We probably won't
know the results'' in the governor's race ``until 7 a.m. the next
morning.''
   The hand-counting will delay results in other races - including
votes in the U.S. Senate contest and even minor city races -
because precincts are required to tally all votes before releasing
any figures, said Elaine Voss, deputy secretary of state.
   To further complicate matters, supporters of former
gubernatorial nominee Jon Grunseth who cast absentee votes for the
ex-candidate will be scrambling on election day to pick another
candidate.
   Grunseth dropped out of the race Sunday amid allegations of
sexual impropriety. Clark, Grunseth's running mate, had claimed she
was entitled to remain the candidate for lieutenant governor, but
the Supreme Court ruled otherwise.
   If voters have mailed absentee ballots and want to make another
choice in the governor's race, they must go to their polling place
before the election judges count absentee ballots. Voters who
haven't mailed their absentee ballots can return the ballots to
their city clerk or county auditor and receive fresh ballots and -
when ready - a supplementary gubernatorial ballot.

<TEXT>
   The National Mortgage Bank of Greece pleaded
guilty Friday to running a $700 million money laundering operation
in the United States and agreed to pay $8 million in fines.
   The bank and 12 of its top U.S. executives were named in a
28-count federal indictment alleging violations of currency
reporting laws, operating a bank without a license and conspiring
to defraud the Internal Revenue Service since September 1985.
   ``I believe, with what the bank did, we are guilty,'' Apostolos
Georgiakis, a governor of the Athens-based bank, told U.S. District
Judge Raymond J. Dearie.
   The bank agreed to pay $8 million, he said, speaking through an
interpreter.
   Federal law enforcement officials say the defendants controlled
the largest money-laundering operation in U.S. history which did
not involve drug money.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney said the penalty was ``the
largest money-laundering fine ever collected in a non-drug related
case.''
   Most of the people named in the indictment have pleaded guilty
or agreed to plead guilty to a single count in the indictment. The
individuals, all Greek citizens who worked in American branches of
the bank, face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines
when they are sentenced next year.
   Two defendants, Vasilis Kretsas and Kostas Giziakis, have fled
the United States and remain fugitives, Maloney said.
   The bank, the second largest in Greece, had branches in New
York, the Chicago area and the suburbs of Boston and Philadelphia.
   The bank's branches were not authorized to perform usual banking
functions in the United States and were only to serve as a liaison
between the bank's customers in the United States and the parent
bank in Athens.
   However, the bank flagrantly violated those limitations and
opened accounts, accepted deposits and processed withdrawals for
thousands of its customers.
   Depositors, under the scheme, brought cash - frequently
suitcases full - to bank branches. Bank employees would then help
change the cash into smaller checks or money orders at nearby
American banks, thus circumventing federal reporting laws on
deposits of more than $10,000.
   The checks were then transferred to Athens or deposited into
bank accounts controlled by the National Mortgage Bank of Greece.
   The bank catered almost entirely to Greek-Americans and promoted
secret deposits in the nited States, assuring depositors the bank
could get them money back from Greece in three days without the IRS
learning of the unreported income.

   A woman was reunited with her 5-year-old
daughter Friday, nearly two weeks after police found the child
locked in a car while her mother was at work.
   ``We embraced, we hugged, we didn't cry. We were just happy,''
Chante Fernandez, accompanied by her daughter, Anjuli, told
reporters after the reunion at an undisclosed location in New
Jersey.
   The case attracted national attention and an outpouring of
support after Ms. Fernandez, a single mother, told authorities she
left her daughter in the car while she worked because she couldn't
find adequate or affordable child care.
   
   Wednesday, a Family Court judge ruled Anjuli should be returned
to her mother no later than Friday.
   Ms. Fernandez, 24, was jailed after police found her pajama-clad
daughter locked in a car in a shopping mall parking lot Oct. 20.
The mother had a weekend sales clerk job at a department store.
   Ms. Fernandez pleaded guilty Oct. 26 to a disorderly persons
offense and was given a $100 suspended fine.
   State officials will retain legal custody of the child until a
progress report is submitted to the court within a month.

   An Army reservist who decided to join
the peace movement rather than report for active duty in Saudi
Arabia was arrested Friday on a charge of military desertion,
authorities said.
   Spec. Stephanie R. Atkinson was arrested at her home in
Murphysboro, the Jackson County sheriff's office said in a

   She was held without bond in the county jail on a warrant
charging her with military desertion.
   Atkinson has been absent without leave since she failed to
report Oct. 15 for duty with the 300th Adjutant General Postal
Company for training at Fort Sheridan before leaving for the
Persian Gulf.
   Her name was entered in the Crime Information Computer to advise
police the Army considered her a deserter.
   In recent interviews with newspapers, Atkinson said she had
became a conscientious objector and opposed war, violence and
President Bush's policy in Saudi Arabia.

   A woman who said she was desperate when she went
to the men's room at a country-western concert was found innocent
Friday of illegally using the restroom.
   Jurors deliberated for 23 minutes before acquitting Denise Wells
of violating a city ordinance that prohibits people from using
restrooms intended for members of the opposite sex in a manner
calculated to cause a disturbance.
   She faced a maximum $200 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor.
   Ms. Wells, 33, and her lawyer and sister, Valorie Wells
Davenport, laughed and hugged each other when the verdict was read.
   ``I'm relieved. I'm elated,'' Ms. Wells said. ``The jurors told
me, `You had us all the way.'''
   Testimony in the trial, which began Thursday, ended earlier in
the day.
   Ms. Wells testified that she saw the line outside the women's
room at the July 7 concert by George Strait was so long, ``I felt I
was in a situation where I had to be in a restroom. I took the only
option I felt was available.''
   The legal secretary said she covered her eyes and apologized to
men already in the restroom at The Summit. A loud remark she made
about leaving the toilet seat up was ``more of a nervous reaction
than a cocky remark,'' she said.
   Ms. Wells was arrested and removed from the concert, for which
she paid $125 to attend.
   ``I was devastated. I felt I was being harassed for doing
something I felt I had no choice but to do. I entered the men's
room to go to the bathroom and that's all,'' she testified.
   Earlier Friday, police officer Steven Andrews said he was not
offended by Ms. Wells' presence in the men's room.
   ``It didn't bother me one way or the other,'' said Andrews, a
vice officer for nearly two decades who was involved in Ms. Wells'
arrest.
   Ms. Davenport said the state failed to prove she had no
permission to enter the men's room and that she entered with the
intent to ``raise a ruckus.''
   Assistant City Attorney Karl Rosette said he didn't think he
needed the Summit management to testify whether Ms. Wells had
permission.
   Ms. Davenport asked Municipal Court Judge Francelia Totty to
declare Ms. Wells innocent, but said she wanted her sister to rebut
some of the testimony offered by police.
   Two police officers have testified Ms. Wells left the stall in
the men's room and announced: ``There - I left the lid up just like
y'all like it.''
   The defense's case focused on the lack of adequate facilities
for women at such public places as the Summit.
   The case has made Ms. Wells a celebrity of sorts. Her bathroom
trip has been the subject of national news coverage and she has
made appearances on the talk shows of Johnny Carson, Geraldo Rivera
and Joan Rivers.
   On Thursday, Officer Daniel B. Ramsey said he was working as a
security guard at the Summit when he answered two men's complaints
that women were in the men's room.
   Ramsey testified he removed three women from the men's room.
When he returned, he saw Ms. Wells coming out of a stall.
   But unlike Andrews, Ramsey, a vice officer for 18 years, said he
was offended by the women's presence in the men's restroom.
   Under cross-examination, Ramsey said 20 women were in a line
stretching into the hallway waiting to enter the women's room,
while the line of people waiting to use the men's room did not
reach past the door.
   Ms. Davenport said her sister waited until intermission was over
and again tried to use the women's room, but the line was even
longer. Then, in desperation, she followed a couple into the men's
room, while the other woman's date cleared the way.

<HEAD>Jury Refuses to Hold Church Responsible For Priest's Affair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury Friday ruled against a former church
secretary who sought $7 million from the Roman Catholic Church,
claiming a priest seduced her and made her pregnant.
   After several hours of deliberations, jurors declined to issue
any damages or hold the Catholic Diocese of Galveston-Houston
responsible for the actions of the Rev. Fernando Noe Guzman.
   Debbie McCorvey, 34, claimed church officials knew Guzman had a
history of sexual misconduct and failed to intervene. She has
claimed that Guzman, 39, forced her into a sexual relationship with
him from July 1985 to June 1987.
   Miss McCorvey's lawsuit originally asked for $11 million in
damages, but her attorneys reduced that amount to $7 million
Thursday.
   Attorneys for the church maintained that Miss McCorvey consented
to the relationship with Guzman. Church officials also have denied
knowing the extent of Guzman's history of sexual misconduct.
   Guzman has admitted having sex with a teen-age parishioner in
1984 in Navasota, 45 miles northwest of Houston. Six months later,
the diocese assigned him to the Houston suburb of Galena Park.
   Miss McCorvey claimed Guzman exploited her dependence on him as
a spiritual counselor and forced her into a violent sexual
relationship. By 1986, Miss McCorvey was divorced from her husband
and pregnant by Guzman.
   Church attorney Margaret Wilson said that after Miss McCorvey
became pregnant, she begged church officials to let her keep her
job teaching religion to children and to allow Guzman to remain a
priest.
   But once Guzman was fired, Miss McCorvey lost interest in him,
the attorney said.

   President Bush, waging a war of words with
Iraq from the campaign trail, is advising American hostage families
to ignore Saddam Hussein's invitation to visit loved ones in
captivity, calling it a brutal ``ploy.''
   ``I think those people should come home to visit with their
families. I think they should be released from captivity,'' Bush
said Thursday. He suggested the Iraqi leader had surpassed even
Adolf Hitler in some forms of brutality.
   And, while the president said he wasn't trying to sound a call
to war, he told a news conference in Orlando, Fla., ``I don't think
the status quo can go on forever and ever.''
   Bush, in a nonstop campaign swing for Republican candidates that
will end on Election Day, was to speak for GOP candidates today
here and in Rochester, Minn., and Sioux City, Iowa, before flying
on to California to spend the night.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - More than 1.5 million people have been
displaced by the Persian Gulf crisis, World Bank officials and
other sources say.
   And hundreds of thousands of workers from the Third World remain
in Iraq and Kuwait. The numbers dwarf the approximately 1,000
hostages from the United States, 1,400 from Britain and 3,000 from
the Soviet Union.
   Hundreds of thousands of others are returning to their distant
homelands, some as far away as the Philippines and South Korea,
said officials at the World Bank, which coordinates aid at its
Washington headquarters for the hardest-hit countries.
   The foreigners were lured to the Middle East by the better wages
that Iraq and Kuwait could pay because of income from oil.

   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The upheaval in the Minnesota governor's race
has battered Rudy Boschwitz as well, forcing the Republican senator
to scramble in a re-election bid once thought to be a sure thing.
   ``He better bring out the heavy artillery. I think he needs
it,'' said Selden Hanson, Minnesota 8th District GOP chairman.
``Three weeks ago I didn't even worry. Now I hope we win. I've got
my fingers crossed.''
   Boschwitz, seeking a third term, had been considered to have one
of the safest senatorial re-election bids this year against
Democrat Paul Wellstone, a political science professor at Carleton
College.
   But his fortunes have turned in the 2{ weeks since allegations
of skinny-dipping with teen-age girls and adultery rang out against
Minnesota's one-time Republican gubernatorial nominee, Jon
Grunseth.

   LONDON (AP) - Debate over Britain's integration into the
European Community has thrown Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher into
a political crisis after her deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, quit in
protest of her resistance to the process.
   Howe's resignation late Thursday prompted speculation that he or
another senior lawmaker may try to oust her as leader of the
Conservative Party - and thus the premiership - in a challenge this
winter.
   But many observers believe a leadership challenge would be too
risky for the party, now less than two years from the June 1992
deadline for the next general election.
   Howe, 63, a soft-spoken man who had come to irritate Mrs.
Thatcher profoundly, according to political insiders, handed his
resignation to her without notice in a 30-minute interview on
Thursday evening.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - For the first time in 15 years of
devastating civil war, the bomb-shattered St. Georges Hotel served
as a backdrop for a fashion show with Moslem and Christian models.
   ``This is the message we hope to carry to the people of our
country: the phoenix rising from the ashes,'' said fashion designer
Loulwa Abdel-Baki, the creator of Thursday's 30-minute program.
   Ms. Abdel-Baki, a member of the Druse Moslem sect, and 20 models
worked 20 days to clear the debris from the lobby of the
once-majestic beachside hotel for the exhibit, ``but left just
enough to remind people of what happened,'' she said.
   The show, called Kalabsha, Arabic for handcuffs, was intended to
boost the latest government efforts to dismantle Beirut's dividing
Green Line and reunite the capital, Abdel-Baki said.

<HEAD>Thinking People's Dance Music From British Duo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Their name may be silly, but their music isn't.
   The Pet Shop Boys pride themselves on crafting witty, often
sardonic lyrics to go with the smooth, synthesized electro-pop on
such hits as ``West End Girls'' and ``What Have I Done to Deserve
This?''
   ``We always used to think of dance music as rhythm - just
something you dance to,'' says Neil Tennant, one half of the
British duo.
   ``But there's no reason why you can't have lyrical content. We
try to have dance music that's kind of thought-provoking.''
   Tennant and his partner, Chris Lowe, continue their musical and
literary pursuits on their first full album in three years,
``Behavior.''
   The first single, ``So Hard,'' is clubland ready-made and
already a hit in Britain. But the rest of the album is something of
a departure: ``softer,'' ``loose'' and ``warm-sounding.''
   The Boys are still trying to lose the calculated, contrived
image they got after their 1986 hit, ``Opportunities,'' which
included the chorus: ``I've got the brains, you've got the looks.
Let's make lots of money.''
   ``Even though we've only ever written two or three satirical
songs about fame, it kind of casts a shadow over everything else
you do,'' says Tennant, the lyricist and generally the more
loquacious of the two.
   So the new album explores new territory, like the Russian
Revolution in ``My October Symphony.'' Another song is based on a
bon mot from Zelda Fitzgerald - ``We were never bored, because we
were never boring,'' she once said.
   ``So Hard'' is a ``true story'' about two of their London
friends and the trouble they have staying together, Tennant says.
   ``I'm always hoping you'll be faithful. But you're not, I
suppose,'' he croons in his distinctive, subdued style.
   ``We've both given up smoking, 'cause it's fatal. So whose
matches are those?''
   In New York recently to shoot a video, Tennant, 36, and Lowe,
31, said they try to write songs that people their age can relate
to.
   ``We're growing older,'' says Tennant, tall and slight, whose
dark complexion and hair is accentuated by an all-black outfit.
``I've always written lyrics from the point of view of someone
who's ...''
   ``Old,'' Lowe interjects.
   ``Incredibly old,'' Tennant agrees as they both break out
laughing.
   Lyrics are intentionally gender-neutral to appeal to all sexes
and sexual orientations. ``We always liked a kind of mystery, a
fascination with sexual ambivalence,'' Tennant says.
   Making compromises is a recurring theme in Pet Shop Boys music -
``finding a compromise between what you really want and what you're
really going to get,'' Tennant says.
   Lowe, dressed like a teen-ager in a T-shirt, jeans and high-top
sneakers, adds, ``It's a pretty big compromise.''
   Tennant and Lowe met in 1981 in a London Hi-Fi shop, began
talking and realized they both were interested in synthesizers. At
the time, Tennant was working in book publishing and Lowe was an
architecture student.
   They began writing their own songs because they hated playing
other people's music. They took their name from two friends who
actually worked in a pet shop, and in 1985 had their first hit,
``West End Girls.''
   Since then, they've sold more than 10 million albums and
achieved what Tennant called ``a medium-level of popularity.''
They're hoping their first U.S. tour early next year will give them
another boost.
   They also snared photographer Bruce Weber, famed for his
erotically charged Calvin Klein ads, to direct the video for
``Being Boring.'' Weber, making his video debut, is shooting on
Long Island in keeping with the song's Fitzgerald-``Great Gatsby''
connection.
   But whether they move up to superstar status or not, the Pet
Shop Boys don't expect their music to ever change.
   ``We always hope to produce a record that moves people in some
way, whether it moves them to dance, or moves them to reflect on
something in their own life, or moves them to cry,'' Tennant says.
``That's what it does to us when we made the record.''

   Neil Young had just seen the movie
``Spinal Tap'' for the first time. And his life took on new
meaning.
   ``That's my life. My life is `Spinal Tap,''' said Young,
reaching for the morning's first cup of coffee.
   The 1984 mock documentary follows hapless rockers on tour, their
future imperiled by a rift with the band's co-founder. Young, who
turned 45 on Nov. 12, doesn't struggle like those low-rent
musicians. He was, though, estranged, saying a few years ago he
never would play again with longtime companions Crazy Horse.
   But now Young has recorded an album with the legendary bar band.
   Awestruck critics say ``Ragged Glory'' resurrects Young's
spontaneous, hard-driving rock 'n' roll. That freewheeling sound
was shelved at times in favor of Young's acoustic ballads and
country rock on solo albums and collaborations with Mynah Birds,
Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills and Nash.
   Young said the time was right to reunite with Crazy Horse. Any
bad blood between him and the band is forgotten.
   ``Crazy Horse is a band that I'm a part of,'' said Young,
wearing his standard uniform: jeans, T-shirt, tennis shoes, Ray
Bans and stubble. ``I lead the band, yeah. But I'm just a member.
It's like returning to your roots. It brings me back to where I
started.''
   Two of Young's most popular and acclaimed albums - 1975's
``Tonight's the Night'' and 1979's ``Rust Never Sleeps'' - were
recorded with Crazy Horse. Their first effort together was 1969's
``Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.'' Their last was 1986's
``Life.''
   Crazy Horse's own new album is titled ``Left for Dead'' in part,
the band members say, because Young and others in the business
abandoned them. In ``Ragged Glory,'' Young is joined by Crazy
Horse's guitarist Frank Sampedro, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer
Ralph Molina.
   ``It may be the best one I've ever done with them,'' Young said.
``It's even. And that's a little peculiar. There's not one song
that really stands out.''
   Last year, Young released what some considered the best album of
1989 and perhaps of his career: ``Freedom.'' Young, who's hardly
given to flowery self-promotion, believes ``Ragged Glory'' is
superior.
   ``I was amazed at the success of `Freedom,' not because I didn't
think it was good, but I was surprised that its shortcomings were
not mentioned more often,'' Young said.
   And what were these shortcomings? ``Well, `Ragged Glory' has
what `Freedom' doesn't have,'' he said. ```Freedom' was OK to
listen to; it's got all the soft songs. But in this album, we'll
lose all the people who like the soft songs.''
   Indeed, only one track on ``Ragged Glory'' - ``Days That Used to
Be'' - could be considered contemplative both lyrically and
musically.
   Filled with longing reminiscences of the '60s - ``Psychedelic
music fills the air, Peace and love live there still'' - the
melancholy song says that personal dreams are threatened by
``possessions and concessions.''
   ``I usually shy away from this kind of song,'' Young said a few
days before setting off on another trip on his sailboat. ``I was in
the middle of the ocean on my boat, halfway between here and there,
and had been there for about 10 days. No airplanes. No other boats.
No noise. But I did see a couple of humpback whales. The song came
to me.''
   The album was recorded at Young's 2,000-acre ranch.
   The band doesn't rehearse, arranges on the spot and avoids
re-recording takes to cover glitches or raw edges. The album stands
like a piece of unfinished furniture.
   ``It doesn't matter how you get it as long as it sounds good in
the end,'' said bassist Talbot. ``People make music, not the
instruments. It's just us hanging out together.''
   On a whim, the band recorded the R&amp;B classic ``Farmer John'' for
the album, even though Young was the only one who knew how to play
it. That carefree approach carries over to Young's songwriting,
too.
   ``I don't sit down and say I'll play a G or something. It's
mindless. It's the other way around from what most people think. It
comes to you and you grab it and then find out what it is.''
   Young was born in Toronto and received a ukulele as a Christmas
gift at age 13. He joined the Squires in 1963, and met Stephen
Stills soon thereafter; he teamed with Stills in Buffalo
Springfield and Crosby, Stills Nash &amp; Young.
   Throughout his career, he has been irreverent. His 1988 song,
``This Note's for You,'' a critique of commercialism in the music
business, yielded a controversial and award-winning video.
   ``I'm the lost character in this place because I don't know
where I fit,'' Young said. ``The record company is building an
image, grooming you. I have no idea what that's all about. Where do
I fit with this?''

<HEAD>Denver Experiment May Be Wave of Election-Night Future</HEAD>

   On Tuesday, as network polls troop to the
voters, NBC-owned station KCNC-TV in Denver will attempt an
election-night experiment that will allow viewers to vote a split
ticket.
   They can watch NBC's prime-time schedule of ``Matlock,'' ``In
the Heat of the Night'' and a one-hour NBC News election night
special on KCNC.
   Or they can tune to Channel 20, independent station KTVD, a UHF
station, and see three full hours of Colorado election coverage,
gathered and reported by the news staff of ... KCNC.
   The NBC station bought the time from the other station, and both
have been promoting the three-hour election-night show on KTVD.
   ``I guess it's as simple as trying to have it both ways,'' says
KCNC news director Marv Rockford. He means pleasing those who
consider election-night coverage a crashing bore and those who
can't get enough of it.
   This split-ticket approach, which Rockford says also is being
tried by several other stations elsewhere in the nation, has a
basic goal.
   It aims to avoid losing audiences to competitors who
counter-program against traditional local prime-time election
coverage with beefed-up entertainment fare - blockbuster movies and
the like.
   Some may wail - quite wrongly, says Rockford - that KCNC is
ducking its news responsibilities. But not David Bartlett,
president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association.
   ``We think it's a pretty good idea,'' says Bartlett, whose
organization claims 3,600 members in broadcasting and cable. ``You
obviously have to treat it delicately. It's really a business
consideration. ...
   ``But from a journalistic standpoint, the idea of offering the
viewer an alternative - a long-form, short-form pair of
alternatives - seems to be the highest execution of our craft, and
that's what we should be doing.''
   Although KCNC is offering two hours of entertainment on election
night, ``we're not going to ignore the elections'' on that station,
Rockford emphasizes.
   In addition to its election show on KTVD, he says, KCNC will air
five-minute election updates until 10 p.m. Denver time, when its
full-tilt election coverage on the other station ends.
   At that point, the coverage will shift to KCNC, pre-empting the
``Tonight'' show and probably ``Late Night With David Letterman.''
   The new two-outlet method of election night coverage, tried on a
cable-only basis during primary races in September by NBC's Boston
affiliate, could prove an electronic wave of the future, Bartlett
says.
   He calls it ``a very elegant solution to this heretofore
insoluble problem of how to make everybody happy,'' the news
junkies and those who don't want their entertainment bumped for a
night of voting results and analyses thereof.
   His opinion is seconded by Everette C. Dennis, executive
director of the Gannett Center for Media Studies:
   ``In a sense, it's probably a better compromise than trying to
play the ratings game, mixing entertainment with election coverage,
or losing a big proportion of the audience with only election
coverage.''
   Many in the industry will be watching the results of the
experiment at KCNC, a station that emphasizes news and plans to add
a one-hour morning news and information show in January that will
air after ``Today.''
   Among them: news director Nancy Valenta of NBC-owned KNBC-TV,
which serves Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest television
market. That station also is strong on news.
   Valenta says its prime-time election coverage will start with
live updates during ``Matlock,'' then pre-empt both ``In the Heat
of the Night'' and the NBC News special for KNBC's own local, state
and national election-night telecast.
   But its coverage will be the traditional kind - seen only on
KNBC.
   Still, ``I think what Denver is doing is new and revolutionary,
and certainly we'll be watching their results to see what comes of
it,'' she says. ``And who knows? If it proves to be successful, it
might happen somewhere else.''
   If it succeeds in Denver, says KCNC's Rockford, ``we'll do it in
the presidential election'' in 1992 and possibly in next year's
mayoral elections.
   ``We don't know if it'll work...whether the three hours of
election returns on channel 20 will attract much of an audience,''
he says.
   ``But the point is, the broadcasting industry is changing so
much, you have to try some of these experiments, some different
ways of doing things ... and unless you find some ways to change
along with it, you're going to be left in the dust.''
   ---
   Elsewhere in television:
   NETWORKS GIRD FOR ELECTIONS, TOO: CBS, NBC and ABC will have
prime-time election specials Tuesday, anchored by Dan Rather, Tom
Brokaw and John Chancellor, and Peter Jennings and David Brinkley,
respectively.
   The NBC and ABC efforts will last an hour, that of CBS two
hours, with all continuing their coverage at 11:30 p.m. Eastern
time.
   With Bernard Shaw anchoring, Cable News Network will start its
coverage of the off-year election returns at 6 p.m. After he signs
off at 1 a.m., CNN will offer a 90-minute wrap-up that includes
final results from the West Coast.

   Combining anemic puns with relevant
statistics, Louis Rukeyser, the host of ``Wall Street Week,'' grins
and winks his way into the homes of 10 million viewers every
Friday.
   Since 1970, Rukeyser has demystified the jargon and gyrations of
the economy. His irreverant attitude toward the often stuffy
subject has made his show one of the most popular half-hours on
public television.
   A 20th anniversary show with some of the program's best guests
will air Nov. 16 from Tavern on the Green restaurant in New York. A
one-hour retrospective will follow on Monday, Nov. 19.
   The rakish Rukeyser is one of the most durable TV personalities
on the air, rivaling veteran luminaries such as Mr. Rogers, Johnny
Carson and Julia Child.
   Rukeyser is known for painful fits of prose. Once while
answering a viewer's letter on investing in a hairpiece
manufacturer, he said, ``If all your money seems to be `hair' today
and gone tomorrow, we'll try to make it grow by giving you the bald
facts on how to get your investments toupee.''
   After a market slump, he considered changing the name of the
show to ``Wall Street Wake.'' He often consoles viewers by telling
them to remember that it's only their money, not their life.
   ``We have in America a bad tendency that things have to be
either serious or fun,'' he said in an interview before taping the
show at Maryland Public Television in suburban Baltimore. ``Whereas
in real life, this isn't true. The teachers we all remember in high
school and college were not the ones who put us to sleep. I don't
think any of us should apologize for not being dull.
   ``Nobody wants to come home on a Friday to be `educated.' First
you have to pull them into the tent.''
   Along the way, Rukeyser was dubbed by People magazine as the
only sex symbol of the ``dismal science'' of economics. The New
York Daily News identified him as the ``economic guru of the
industry.''
   ``Outside of the Wall Street Journal, Rukeyser has been a
pioneer in demonstrating the popular appeal of quality business
journalism,'' said media critic Thomas Rosenstiel of the Los
Angeles Times. ``He is especially good at proving that this stuff
can be interesting and useful without being deadly dull.''
   Rukeyser, 57, appears each week with three panelists, chosen
from a pool of money managers and financial analysts, who question
the guest of the week, such as the chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or noted economist John Kenneth Galbraith. In
addition, technical analysts, whom he calls elves, vote on a weekly
``elves Index'' that assesses the strength or weakness of the
economy.
   Rukeyser doesn't make any predictions other than to say he is a
long-term bull. He constantly issues disclaimers on stock tips
offered by guests of the show. Their recommendations often cause
share prices to rise sharply the week after the show airs.
   Ralph Acampora, head of Prudential Bache's technical analysis
division and one of Rukeyser's elves, credits him with starting
business coverage on television.
   ``When I started with Prudential, I told them I wanted a big
chart room and a television,'' Acampora said. ``They asked me why I
wanted a TV and I told them Mrs. O'Brien sitting at home has the
greatest information in the world.''
   That mythical viewer is watching business news on CNN and FNN,
and it's all because of Rukeyser, Acampora said.
   A former foreign correspondent for ABC and The (Baltimore) Sun,
Rukeyser became the first economic commentator for a network in
1968 with ABC. He moonlighted on the PBS show for three years
before leaving ABC, complaining about television coverage of
economics.
   He still maintains economics is the most poorly covered area of
American journalism.
   ``The prevailing view is that the subject of economics is too
dull and or too complicated to hold an audience larger than the
capacity of your average telephone booth,'' he said. ``I think
that's nonsense. I think there is a hunger in the American public
for clear, believable, understandable, usable pocketbook
information.''
   Despite his bullish outlook, he concedes the economy is
currently looking bleak, but is quick to remind anyone that he does
not invest for short-term profit.
   ``Punk, anemic, weak, getting weaker. The outlook for the next
few months is soggy at best,'' Rukeyser said. ``But even with
minimal policy changes we can be on our way again by 1992.''
   Rukeyser, who writes a syndicated newspaper column, gives
lectures and has written two books, is known for being tough on his
panelists and guests. He continually pleads with them to speak in
English.
   ``Jargon is a very convenient shield for people not entirely
sure of what they are saying,'' he said.
   Rukeyser says he will continue doing the show as long as it is
fun, which it still is, and as long as his audience still wants
him.
   Or as he might put it: His ratings stock remains bullish and the
dividends rewarding. So rally round the tube in confidence the guru
will keep your interest primed.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Rap has emerged as the most controversial form
of youthful expression since rock 'n' roll in the 1950s. There was
a time when Elvis was considered obscene, and had gone ``too far.''
Now groups such as the Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew have gone much

   Rap music without controversy would be like Run
without DMC - like Chuck D without something to say.
   ``I think the government has a lot better things to take care of
than the lyrics in rap music,'' said Chuck D, referring to the
recent obscenity trial of the rap group 2 Live Crew, who were
acquitted by a Florida court. ``Joblessness, homelessness, better
health care and education is what they need to worry about.''
   Chuck D, who was born Carlton Ridenhour in Queens, N.Y., is not
your ordinary rap star. The music of his group, Public Enemy,
concerns contemporary issues, their videos don't have choreographed
dance routines and Chuck D doesn't wear gold chains. He went to
Adelphi University and lives in a Long Island suburb.
   He is in his cluttered office at the group's recording studio in
Hempstead, N.Y., wearing a Detroit Pistons T-shirt, paint-splotched
sweat pants and a Los Angeles Kings baseball cap - backwards.
   ``Materialism isn't good for the black community,'' Chuck D
says. ``It just has everybody questing for that money. And if that
money is in very few areas and you don't have the know-how or the
opportunity to get it, then you're gonna start feeding off each
other.''
   Not that Chuck D can't afford gold chains. The band that has
attempted a leveraged buyout of controversy began its second world
tour of the year on Oct. 27, making stops in the rap havens of Hong
Kong and Australia, among others.
   The group's third album, ``Fear of a Black Planet,'' was
released earlier this year and has gone platinum (more than 1
million copies sold). Public Enemy completed a 55-city American
tour in early September, which preceded a seven-city Canadian tour.
   The self-styled ``Prophets of Rage'' have thrived without
softening their sound. The band has not candy-coated its lyrics to
accommodate the pop charts.
   ``I don't duck no issues,'' Chuck D said. ``I come down on
brothers maybe five, six times an album. I got to come down on
sisters sometimes, too, for their faults. Nobody's not guilty. Just
like I come down on white supremacy. I got to come down on
everybody.''
   On ``Brothers Gonna Work It Out,'' Chuck D implores historians
to tell the truth of the black American's plight.
   On ``911 Is a Joke,'' Chuck's partner in rhyme, the jester-like
Flavor Flav (born Charles Drayton), berates the response time of
emergency medical service crews, declaring, ``I'll call a cab
'cause a cab'll come quicker.''
   And on ``Welcome to the Terrordome,'' Chuck D enraged the Jewish
community with ``Crucifixion ain't no fiction - So-called chosen
frozen - Apologies made to whoever pleases - Still they got me like
Jesus.''
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith denounced the lyrics
of ``Welcome to the Terrordome'' as anti-Semitic, which was nothing
new to Public Enemy. In 1989, former band member Professor Griff
blamed Jews ``for the majority of wickedness that goes on across
the globe.''
   The album also attacked the ``black hands'' responsible for the
murders of Muslim leader Malcolm X and Black Panther Huey Newton;
the white teen-agers in Brooklyn who killed a black teen-ager; and
the 1989 Virginia Beach riots.
   ``These people are just stuck on those lines and didn't know
what the rest of the song said,'' said Chuck D, who says he is not
anti-Semitic, just pro-black. ``That song dealt with a lot of
different issues, different things.''
   If you want BMWs, sexy ladies and self-aggrandizement, listen to
Eric B and Rakim. If you want popular pap-rap, turn on MTV and
check out MC Hammer. Rap cognoscenti have come to expect the
unexpected from Public Enemy.
   Public Enemy's first album, ``Yo! Bum Rush the Show,'' was
released in 1987 but the group's breakthrough album was the widely
acclaimed ``It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back,'' issued
the following year. The hit single ``Don't Believe the Hype'' asked
listeners to form their own opinions about the group without the
influence of the media.
   Ah yes, the media. Public Enemy is not into public relations.
Chuck D described a New York Times reporter as being ``on his own
trip.'' He called the New York Post ``the worst piece of ... on the
planet.'' Harry Allen, the group's public relations director, goes
by the title of ``Media Assassin.''
   ``Most of my criticism has come through white male critics,''
Chuck D said. ``Who ... are they to give me criticism when I'm
talking about a serious situation going on in my community that
they don't hardly know about?
   ``My suggestion to white critics is that they should know what
they're talking about.''
   The group also has a DJ, named Terminator X, whose real name is
Norman Rogers, and a security force that accompanies them onstage.
They don't do much except stand around in army fatigues and red
berets, carrying fake Uzis and looking mean.
   Despite his importance in the music industry, Chuck D does not
covet the title of ``rappo de tutti rappi.'' He is unassuming and
has no misconceptions of his own grandiosity.
   ``I don't really look at myself as being the man because it's
usually interchangeable with other people,'' he said. ``It feels
very good just to share a seat with the other rappers.''
   The phone rings and it's the Flav. He has to go to Connecticut
and can't come in to finish up the group's latest project, titled,
``Get the ... Outta Dodge.'' The title is a reference to Dodge
City, which is quickly becoming a euphemism for New York and its
Wild-West atmosphere.
   ``New York is a bad territory because of the limited
opportunites for the black communities and the growing amount of
limited opportunities in the white community,'' Chuck D said.
   His solution is a blueprint for Marxism.
   ``I'd like to make it even all the way around where 100 percent
of the people share 100 percent of the product,'' he said.
   ``There should be a salary cap. There shouldn't be ones at the
bottom with nothing. No one should go without. There's enough in
this world for everybody to have.''

   Houston rappers The Geto Boys are scatological,
misogynist, violent and homophobic, their critics say.
   Maybe, they respond, but they're not apologetic.
   ``The Geto Boys would rather be hated for what we are than loved
for what we are not,'' says Bushwick Bill, one-fourth of the
controversial crew whose new album made headlines before a single
copy was available.
   Hated? You've got it.
   An Indiana plant refused to press copies of ``The Geto Boys''
because of its offensive lyrics. Geffen Records backed out of a
national record distribution deal for the same reason. Two record
store chains will not sell the group's national debut.
   The National Organization for Women charges their lyrics promote
violence against women. The flap over their songs such as ``Mind of
a Lunatic'' and a pair of unprintable titles caused some people,
including ex-New York mayor Edward Koch to add their voices to the
anti-Geto Boys chorus.
   ``The Geto Boys sing rap songs so foul that their own record
company refuses to distribute their album,'' wrote Koch, who
decried their ``sickening lyrics'' and suggested the group
encouraged ``rape and mayhem.''
   Does all this bother Bushwick Bill? He responds with an
obscenity, a ``no'' and a fast-paced defense of his record.
   ``I always knew they can't stop the truth. The truth is going to
be heard. We're holding a mirror up to America, and letting them
see their naked selves. Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of
men? That's the mirror we're holding up,'' says Bushwick.
   It's also a mirror of Houston's Fifth Ward, the desolate
neighborhood the group once called home. Although none of the four
lives there anymore, it remains their base of operations.
   The band celebrated the release of its new album last month with
a party at Club Obsession in the old 'hood. The loyalty lies in
part with their support there; the band sold 500,000 copies of its
last album on the local Rap-A-Lot label before signing a national
deal.
   ``The Fifth Ward is shotgun shacks, houses ined up beside each
other. There's a lot of wild dogs, prostitution, needles on the
floor,'' says Bushwick. ``If you're walking down the street and you
look wrong, somebody'll beat your ... .''
   How it was growing up in the Fifth Ward is reflected in their
lyrics, in such songs as ``Assassins'' and ``City Under Siege.''
   ``Some kids never even make the milk cartons. That's why we can
hit hard like that, because that's how we grew up,'' says Bushwick.
``You step out the front door, it's survival. ... You only get a
minute to pray and a second to die.''
   The Geto Boys are not alone in the controversy over rap lyrics.
But unlike 2 Live Crew, who were recently acquitted of obscenity
charges in Florida, the Geto Boys choose not to use the First
Amendment as a explanation for their lyrics.
   ``According to the same Constitution, we're considered
three-fourths of a human being,'' Bushwick said. ``The First
Amendment doesn't apply to us. ... We've never been protected by
any American law.''
   The one song that has drawn the most criticism is ``Mind of a
Lunatic,'' in which the band details the rape and murder of a
random victim chosen only because her curtains are open. Bushwick
defends the song, comparing it to the work of Alfred Hitchcock.
   ``I don't get it. When Alfred Hitchcock directed `Psycho,' he
filmed from a maniac's point of view: his fears, his feelings, his
thoughts,'' says Bushwick. ``That's how we wrote `Mind of a
Lunatic.' Alfred did the same thing. ... I think it has a lot to do
with race.''
   The group, including the diminutive Bushwick, is all black.
   The flap over the album hasn't persuaded anyone in the band to
change his approach. In fact, says Bushwick, it has strengthened
their resolve to get it done their own way.
   ``We'll keep on calling it the way we see it,'' concludes
Bushwick. ``Just because it's not going on in your neighborhood
doesn't mean it isn't going on.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Rap has emerged as the most controversial form
of youthful expression since rock 'n' roll in the 1950s. There was
a time when Elvis was considered obscene, and had gone ``too far.''
Now groups such as the Geto Boys and 2 Live Crew have gone much
further.

   Hurricane, the aptly named emcee of the Afros,
paused during a recent interview and noted the parental advisory
label on the rap group's debut album.
   He then picked up a reporter's tape recorder and pressed the
microphone against his mouth and intoned:
   ``THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE A BLACK MAN MAKE IT. THOSE PEOPLE WHO
DISAGREE, THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE US MAKE IT. WE DON'T WANT TO SELL
DRUGS. WE'RE TRYING TO STAY CLEAR OF DRUGS. WE DON'T WANT TO ROB
NOBODY. WE WANT TO MAKE RECORDS AND EXPRESS OURSELVES WITH RECORDS.
GROWING UP IN THE GHETTO, WE GOT ATTITUDES.''
   And this is supposed to be a mellow day for Hurricane and fellow
Afros, who picked at a lunch of baconburgers and orange juice as
they spoke at the Manhattan offices of Columbia Records.
   They're not as nasty as 2 Live Crew, but that's not because they
don't wanna be. ``Kickin' Afrolistics'' has plenty of strong words,
most of them suitable for airplay, and a point of view that
Hurricane advises will only get more explicit.
   ``We didn't want to come out and be just any rappers,'' he said.
``It would be kind of hard to get attention. We decided to be
Afros, as in Afro-Americans. Afros symbolize black power. We knew
the reaction would be `Oh, wow.'''
   The Afros are veterans in this business, or to put it another
way, they're the oldest established permanent floating rap game in
New York. Emcees Hurricane and Kool Tee grew up a few houses from
each other in Queens - the same neighborhood as Run-DMC's Jam
Master Jay - and started rapping in 1976, before anyone had even
heard of rap and when everyone had heard of Afros.
   It was all for fun at first, hanging out in the park and
chanting dirty nursery rhymes you'd otherwise find scratched on
bathroom walls. But the better they became the more they thought
about it as a way of life. The Afros started rapping at house
parties, then clubs, and when Run-DMC and others hit it big in the
1980s they figured their turn was coming.
   ``We're not rockers and we're not r&amp;b, and we can't sing,''
Hurricane said. ``The young black generation has the gift of being
able to rap and we are part of that young black generation. We can
rap off anything, jazz, r&amp;b, rock. Rap brings back people you
forgot about. We bring back Parliamant, James Brown, Rick James..
.''
   How many Afros there are depends on who happens to show up on a
particular day. Hurricane (born Wendel Fyte), Kool Tee (born Tadone
Hill) and deejay Kippy-O (whose real name is Kip Morgan) were
around for the interview. Auxiliary Afros - actually Afros
Auxiliary - Smith, Doc, Cool E (a.k.a. The Dictionary), Jah Easy,
Randy, Marvin, Davy D and Jam Master Jay are out there spreading
the word.
   The Afros are also friendly with Public Enemy, and toured with
them this summer. Most of the memories are happy ones, at least
when they were the only people on stage.
   ``We almost got arrested in Augusta, Ga.,'' Kool Tee said. ``We
were doing a song called `Hoe Cakes' and nobody told us when we got
on stage we can't curse. We came to the show late. We came on stage
and they wanted to arrest and our manager talked them out of it.
They put the handcuffs out and they said, `We run a clean city
here. We don't have stuff like that here.'''
   Most of the 16 songs on ``Kickin' Afrolistics,'' such as ``Afro
Like a Mutha,'' ``Coolin' With the Fros'' and the single ``Feel
It,'' are good-time raps, but the record becomes more serious on
``Straight From the Penial'' and ``Federal Offense.''
   ``I was looking in the paper and I was reading about six bodies
found in the water,'' Hurricane said. ``I just started singing `Six
bodies found in the water, the people said it was manslaughter.' We
came up with `Federal Offense.'''
   The Afros get inspiration from television, magazines, the
streets and probably orange juice and baconburgers if they put
their minds to it. Because of all the time spent performing on
stage and trying to hook up with a label, the record took three
years to make. Finding the right bass sound for ``Jump'' also
caused delays.
   They see themselves coming from the same direction as Public
Enemy, talking about black power and ways of encouraging young fans
to express themselves. The Afro hairdos may be the first thing you
notice, but Hurricane promises the songs will be just as memorable.
   ``I held back a little on this album,'' he said. ``First you get
their attention, and when you got their support, you just slam 'em
with everything. The next album we're gonna slam 'em.''

   Sing as if you stuck your finger in a hot frying
pan, or write songs about drugs deals and desperation and people
might get the idea you're a little unhappy.
   But the members of Soul Asylum insist they're not bitter or
cynical, just realistic. Dragging people down is not what this band
stands for even if they do present life in three-minute bursts of
agony.
  Singer-guitarist Dave Pirner, for instance, is a veteran of
flipping burgers and mowing lawns who cites the group's very
existence as proof that none of them are giving up.
   ``You know, you got to work hard for your good times,'' says
Pirner, speaking in a groan that recalls a 45 rpm record being
played at 33. ``You got something to get off your chest and you're
actually celebrating the fact you're spitting it all out and
putting the cards on the table.
   ``It's like blues music, it's pretty bleak stuff. People are
trying to get stuff out in the open and share it with people who
identify with things that aren't always sex, driving and dancing.''
   ``Soul Asylum and the Horse They Rode On,'' the band's first
record since 1988, was produced by Steve Jordan, who worked on
Keith Richards' ``Talk Is Cheap'' LP.
   The music is fast and tight, ranging from guitar rave-ups such
as ``Bitter Pill'' and ``Be on Your Way,'' to the bluesy ``Nice
Guys,'' to the rockabilly-influenced ``Brand New Shine.''
   With all that noise and no lyric sheet, it's not easy to catch
the words, but occasionally they slow down to make sure a key
phrase - ``If I lost my mind would you help me find it,'' or ``It's
not supposed to make you feel so helpless'' - is not missed.
   ``We kind of sat down and talked about the idea of this being a
band and bringing it back to what it's all about in the first
place,'' Pirner said. ``Steve said, `You guys are about playing
live. You guys are a band and we want to emphasize that as much as
possible.'''
   ``These songs are in a story format,'' said guitarist Dan
Murphy. ``You're trying to put something down that people are going
to listen to outside the context of a rock concert. I prefer
something that's thought-provoking or having some imagery.''
   Murphy, drummer Grant Young and bassist Karl Mueller attended
the same high school in Minneapolis, and they hooked up with Pirner
a couple of years later. They were originally called Loud Fast
Rules and were ``a terrible band, the band that wouldn't go away,''
Murphy recalled.
   ``The scariest show I remember playing was in Philadelphia,'' he
said. ``There was a capacity of 600 and they put in a thousand
people. These people seemed like they wanted to kill each other and
then kill us. Bottles were flying.
   ``In London, the same thing happened. There was a pub and people
were just killing each other.''
   ``You'd stop the song,'' Pirner added, ``and people would slow
down a bit. Then you'd start the next one and they'd start punching
each other again.''
   Somehow, band and listeners stuck it out, and Soul Asylum went
on to share bills with the Replacements, Husker Du and even Billy
Idol. By 1984, they had signed with Twin-Tone Records and released
their debut album, ``Say What You Will ...''
   Other records include ``Hang Time'' and ``Clam Dip and Other
Delights,'' and they have covered such songs as James Brown's ``Hot
Pants,'' the Bangles' ``Walk Like an Egyptian'' and Dr. John's
``Right Place, Wrong Time.'' In 1987, the group signed with a major
label, A&amp;M Records.
   Soul Asylum now faces the same challenge as any rock 'n' roll
band that's been around a few years: Keep the spirit that drove
your early records, but don't try to make them sound the same.
   So if Pirner's flicking ashes into the cuffs of his rolled-up
jeans suggests incurable adolescence, Murphy's talk of ``getting
our business licks down'' and raising a family indicates the band
is looking for ways to become more adult but not less contemporary.
   ``Being 28 is pretty staggering in a lot of ways,'' said Murphy,
who became a father late last year. ``It's not fun anymore and it's
time to get on with your life. You got to keep asking quesitons. If
things were easy for us, we could start singing about sports cars.
   ``It's my occupation, but it's not my life. We've been at it
long enough that we all have a pretty good sense of who we are.
When the well runs dry, we'll be fine.''

<TEXT>
   The stillness of this ancient
oasis is shattered now and then by army gunfire or Israeli soldiers
shouting through loudspeakers: ``This is a curfew! Anyone leaving
his house will be punished!''
   For Jericho, the Israelis are the latest of many invaders, like
the warrior Joshua, who felled its famous walls with a blast of
trumpets and put a curse on any man who would rebuild the town.
   On scorching summer days, when the sun beats down and mosquitoes
and flies buzz through mud-brick huts and white stone houses, it
seems as if Joshua's curse still afflicts the town, which is as old
as civilization.
   Yet, Jericho is a place of rare beauty. The sweet smells of
jasmine and orange blossoms waft through the air, bursts of red and
orange bougainvillea dot the lush green of the oasis against a
backdrop of the dusty Judean hills.
   It also has come to resemble a ghost town during the 34-month
Palestinian uprising. Stores and restaurants close at noon on
orders from pro-PLO leaders who want a united front against Israeli
occupation. Few of the 12,000 Palestinian townspeople come out.
   ``It's boring now. The only thing I do in the evenings is visit
my friends,'' said Wajihah Godah, 28, who works as a secretary in
Jerusalem, about 20 miles away.
   After sundown, the streets belong to the soldiers and the
``shebab,'' teen-age activists who mask their faces with
black-and-white checked Arab headdresses called keffiyehs.
   In the darkness, the shebab move silently through gardens and
alleys, spraying walls with slogans like ``PLO, Israel No'' or a
favorite, mocking symbol: a Nazi swastika paired with a Jewish Star
of David.
   They stone Israeli cars racing along the main road from
Jerusalem to Tiberias. A prize target is the black limousine of
Foreign Minister David Levy, who commutes through part of the West
Bank between Jerusalem and his home in Beit Shean, an Israeli town.
   The uprising has taken 10 lives in Jericho and the neighboring
refugee camps of Aqabat Jaber and Ein Sultan.
   Four Israelis were killed in the firebombing of a bus, Israelis
shot three Palestinians to death and three others were slain by
fellow Arabs who suspected them of being informers.
   More people have been killed in other places, and sometimes
outsiders say Jericho sleeps while the rest of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip is burning.
   Winters are mild in Jericho, and it was a favorite resort of
Arabs before Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war. Christian pilgrims, curious Israelis and West Bank
residents kept it going afterward.
   Until the uprising, bands played Arabic music in garden
restaurants along the main road. Stately matrons with scarves tied
around their hips sometimes performed sensuous belly dances to
shouts and applause.
   Young men, chain-smoking American cigarettes, played cards in
the coffeeshops. Israelis stopped on the way home from outings at
the Dead Sea to buy pottery or pomelas, a football-sized citrus
fruit grown in the area.
   Busloads of foreign tourists came to see Jericho, which is the
lowest town on Earth, at 850 feet below sea level, in addition to
being one of the oldest and best-known.
   They climbed to the Byzantine Monastery of the Temptation,
carved into a steep hillside north of town to mark where the Bible
says the Devil tempted Jesus for 40 days, or toured nearby Tel
Sultan, where remains of city walls date from 7000 B.C.
   The garden restaurants are closed now. Israelis and most foreign
tourists stay away for fear of being stoned.
   Jericho's people have adapted to the rebellion, and the boredom.
   When leaders of the uprising called a one-week strike to protest
the killings of 20 Palestinians on Temple Mount in Jerusalem, the
three video shop owners dutifully closed but still did booming
business, renting movies from their homes or car trunks.
   Frequent general strikes leave plenty of time for visiting. In
the evenings, families sit on garden chairs in their front yards,
scrutinizing whoever passes.
   Sometimes it's only a herd of goats or an army foot patrol. But
if someone familiar comes along, and in Jericho that's nearly
everyone, they call out ``T'fadalu!'' - Arabic for ``Please come
in.''
   Each arrival is offered tea with fresh mint, and in return
contributes a little gossip. A recent tidbit concerned a man who
charged into a neighbor's house, after her goats ate his flowers,
and now fears revenge from her angry clan.
   Saeb Erakat, a journalist from Jericho who supports the
Palestine Liberation Organization, says the uprising has brought
people closer.
   ``Divorce rates are down, there has been a big decline in family
feuds and people share more because of the economic hardships,'' he
said.
   Amid the upheavals of occupation and uprising, Jericho's people
take some comfort from its turbulent history.
   They live among cultural relics of Romans, Crusaders, Ottoman
Turks and other invaders.
   All the foreign armies left, eventually.

<HEAD>Analysts See Faster Fed Action</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If many Wall Street crystal balls are
functioning properly, the Federal Reserve may soon get more
aggressive in its efforts to lower interest rates and stimulate the
sagging economy.
   Signs of an incipient recession are building up, analysts note,
increasing pressure on the Fed to do something to brake the
economy's slide.
   Furthermore, they argue, the forces that have militated against
an easing of the central bank's credit policy - most notably fears
of inflation - are showing signs of ebbing.
   But these same observers caution that a new approach by the Fed
would come with no guarantee of fast, effective relief for the
problems afflicting the economy and the stock market.
   They say there is a real danger that Chairman Alan Greenspan and
his colleagues will find themselves ``pushing on a string'' -
trying to prod the economy without getting much immediate response
on the other end.
   ``The economy started to dive in early October,'' says Edward
Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Yardeni says a full-scale recession might still be staved off if
some sudden resolution of the showdown in the Persian Gulf drove
oil prices below $20 a barrel. But that, he acknowledges, looks
like a long-shot proposition at best.
   ``A better bet is that the Federal Reserve is likely to lower
short-term interest rates very sharply very soon,'' he asserts.
``The economy desperately needs easier monetary policy.''
   The rise of the civilian unemployment rate from 5.4 percent at
the start of the summer to 5.7 percent last month provides one
rationale for Fed easing.
   The Bush administration and Congress also helped clear the way
by reaching agreement at last in late October on a federal budget
plan, even though the measure is expected to put only a slight dent
in the government deficit.
   The Fed gave a nod of acknowledgment to that development last
Monday with moves that pushed down the interest rate on federal
funds, or overnight loans between banks, from the neighborhood of 8
percent to about 7.5 percent.
   With a bit more oomph behind it soon, Yardeni says, the federal
funds rate is likely to hit 7.25 percent by yearend and 6.75
percent by March 1991.
   For the past several months, the Fed's maneuvering room has been
widely viewed as limited because of inflation worries in general
and soaring oil prices in particular.
   If the Fed sought to ease, it was widely believed, long-term
interest rates might actually rise rather than fall, because bond
traders feared that the authorities were abandoning their
anti-inflation stand.
   Now, however, economists say recent declines in a wide range of
commodity prices other than oil have cooled inflationary fears.
   What may prompt Fed action faster than anything else, many
analysts agree, is the shaky state of the banking system.
   ``As we see it over the next several months, investors, like the
central bank, will switch anxieties,'' says Robert Barbera,
economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
   ``Deflation worries, reflecting falling asset prices and banking
system fissures, will soon overwhelm inflation concerns.''
   In the world of banking, Barbera says, ``strains normally
associated with recession are already acute. Recently, U.S.
financial markets have been confronted with the first signs of bank
funding difficulties.
   ``When the banking system's safety and soundness are called into
question, dramatic ease is the necessary response, and we are
confident that the Fed will deliver.''

<HEAD>Cole Porter's Music Comes Alive Again in AIDS Tribute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The songs of Cole Porter have come alive
again for a cause the composer couldn't have imagined before his
death in 1964.
   ``Red, Hot and Blue,'' a benefit album for AIDS research and
relief, matches such artists as U2, Sinead O'Connor, Fine Young
Cannibals, Neneh Cherry and the Neville Brothers to songs made
popular in the 1930s and '40s.
   The 20-song CD is a daydream come true for New York City art
critic John Carlin and his friends at the New York city law firm
that manages the late songwriter's trust fund.
   ``It struck me that the Cole Porter songs were a wonderful way
to make a contemporary record that would appeal to all sorts of
people and deliver a message,'' said Carlin, who wanted to do
something for friends dying of AIDS.
   ``Everyone loves Cole Porter,'' he said. ``No one's covered his
songs for 20 or 30 years. In the back of my mind I always wondered
what it would be like for David Byrne to sing a Cole Porter song,
or Tom Waits.''
   In those cases, it sounds a lot like how Byrne and Waits sing
their own songs. But other results will surprise fans of both
Porter and contemporary music - like the Jungle Brothers' rap on
``I Get a Kick Out of You'' and the torch song stylings of country
star k.d. lang and dance-pop singer Jody Watley.
   ``The songs worked better than we dreamed,'' Carlin said. ``What
was a simple love ballad, when played in this context, took on a
different meaning.''
   Porter's career stretched from the '20s through the '50s. His
songs were a staple on Broadway and in movies, and he was known for
his humorous, often boundary-breaking, treatments of love and sex.
   AIDS, of course, wasn't a worry when Porter was around. On a few
of the new versions of Porter's songs, particularly Cherry's blunt
rap to ``I've Got You Under My Skin,'' the disease is addressed.
   It was the initial participation of Cherry and Byrne that really
got the project going because it helped convince other artists to
join in, Carlin said. Carlin and two entertainment lawyers who work
at the law firm that manages the Porter trust fund, F. Richard
Pappas and Leigh Blake, put it together.
   The album veers recklessly from style to style. There's the
campy rock duet of Deborah Harry and Iggy Pop on ``Well, Did You
Evah,'' the cool soul of Fine Young Cannibals' ``Love for Sale,''
the African language version of ``Begin the Beguine'' by Salif
Keita and the rollicking Irish duet by Kirsty MacColl and the
Pogues on ``Miss Otis Regrets.''
   Despite the album's variety, Carlin concedes there's something
missing. The album has no Latin ifluences and not enough black
voices, an important omission considering the impact of AIDS in
those communities.
   And there are no heavy metal artists.
   Carlin said the lack of hard rock artists was largely by design
- he didn't feel the genre was appropriate to Porter's songs. It's
also because, he said, that community is without a doubt the most
homophobic in the music business.
   Last year, the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City dropped
the band Guns 'N Roses from an AIDS benefit concert after
organization volunteers noted the lyrics to one of their songs,
``One in a Million,'' contained the lyrics: ``Immigrants and
faggots, they make no sense to me.''
   Several artists asked to participate refused because of the
stigma attached to AIDS and homosexuality, Carlin said.
   ``There were a few big artists,'' he said. ``I don't want to
give the names of people who didn't do it for the wrong reasons.
I'm surprised at how many artists we did get.''
   The only artist Carlin will reveal who turned down a request to
participate was Prince, but it had nothing to do with homophobia.
Carlin said he wanted him to record a version of ``Let's
Misbehave,'' but Prince was too busy on his ``Graffiti Bridge''
movie and soundtrack.
   When organizers approached an artist to ask for involvement,
they suggested a tune from the Porter songbook. Most took the
advice. Some artists, including MacColl and Watley, had their own
ideas for songs.
   ``We wanted the album to be very modern and very
youth-oriented,'' Carlin said. ``We wanted a club sound, not an
Ella Fitzgerald sound.''
   Watley, known for her dance music, remembered a Fitzgerald
recording she listened to as a child to use as a model for her
version of ``After You, Who.'' She said she relished the chance to
sing a jazz tune, something she can't do on her own records.
   ``After recording this song I've been asked by virtually
everyone who heard it, `Are you going to do an album like this?'''
Watley said. ``Even my mom asked me that.''
   An expert on Porter's work said he's excited about the project
and predicted that Porter would have been, too.
   ``The man was insatiable in his curiosity and he traveled all
over the world to listen to all kinds of performances of his
music,'' said Robert Kimball, who's written and edited several
books on Porter's music. ``He was genuinely open to all different
interpretations. My feeling is he would have reacted very
enthusiastically to it.''
   A 90-minute TV special featuring videos of artists performing
their Porter songs is scheduled to air on ABC-TV at 11:30 p.m. on
Dec. 1. A videocassette is expected to be released next year.
   The lawyers have formed a non-profit corporation called King
Cole, Inc. that will funnel profits from ``Red, Hot and Blue'' to
AIDS organizations all over the world. A committee of
representatives from the project, including musicians and
filmmakers, will recommend which charities receive the money.

   The 1990 campaign has been a little like the
capricious New England weather. If you don't like it, just wait a
minute.
   Less than six months ago, politicians were at fever pitch over a
constitutional amendment to ban flag-burning. Reluctant Democrats
feared for their patriotic reputations; crusading Republicans
smelled blood.
   It's hard now to recall the passion and acrimony generated by
that once blazing concern, and harder still to find traces of it on
the campaign trail.
   Ephemeral, fickle, call the season what you will, but issues
came and went almost as quickly as movies of the week - until the
campaign came home to roost in voter pocketbooks.
   ``The only national issue is the economy - taxes, economic
leadership and fairness. It's driving the entire electorate,'' said
analyst Stuart Rothenberg, publisher of The Political Report.
   President Bush attempted to shift voter attention to the Persian
Gulf in the final days of the campaign, heating up his rhetoric and
declaring he had ``lost patience'' with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   The president succeeded in dominating the news with an issue
that traditionally favors his party. But most analysts predicted
that the economic themes working to the Democrats' advantage would
remain an influential factor in the election.
   When candidates first hit the campaign trail months ago, Kuwait
had not yet been invaded. Recession worries were hypothetical and
budget talks were a speck on the distant horizon.
   Emotional ``values'' issues were the political currency of the
moment. Some candidates pledged their allegiance to the
flag-burning ban. Others stoked the controversy over federally
funded obscene art.
   Big-state gubernatorial candidates waged a spirited competition
over who would order the most executions, deny the most paroles,
propose the harshest penalties for drug-users.
   Congress was put on the defensive for voting itself a pay raise
and then became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal. The
issues proved potent in a smattering of races, and planted the
first seeds of anti-incumbent, rich-vs.-poor sentiment among
voters.
   Abortion also took a brief turn on center stage. But the waters
got muddied and the issue lost its fire. Both parties ran
candidates with a full range of positions. States, meanwhile,
failed to impose the serious restrictions anticipated in the wake
of a 1989 Supreme Court decision, and abortion moved to the wings
in most races.
   The spotted owl flew by and prompted intense debate in the
Northwest. But the conflict over whether to protect forest habitat
for the tiny owl at the expense of logging jobs never broadened
into a compelling national issue, and environmental concerns
colored only scattered races across the country.
   Communism fell and the peace dividend arose. Early in the
campaign, candidates proposed 50-percent cuts in military spending
and argued over whether to use the money saved from the Cold War
thaw to expand domestic programs or reduce the deficit.
   Then came the late-summer Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the
deployment of U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia. The peace dividend
vanished like a mirage in the blinding desert sun; the nation
worried about war, incumbents looked like statesmen and other
issues temporarily were swept aside.
   But politicians of both parties rallied behind Bush's policies,
the standoff dragged on without shooting and the issue waned until
Bush sought to revive it at the end.
   The declining economy and turbulent federal budget negotiations
combined in September to produce the potent pocketbook themes that
dominated the campaign's final weeks.
   The battle cry of no new taxes turned into a debate over whose
new taxes and voters witnesed a confusing, chaotic struggle over
their economic futures.
   Democrats railed at ``high-flyers'' and the rich who got richer
in the 1980s at everyone else's expense. ``Let's go and get it from
those who got it,'' Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., declared during
floor debate over whether to raise taxes on the wealthy.
   The ``fairness'' pitch hadn't been particularly successful in
the past and Democratic leaders were not making much headway this
year from the launchpad of the bipartisan S&amp;L scandal.
   Then they received a series of assists from Bush - his reversal
on the need for new taxes, his insistence on a capital gains tax
cut, his painful public wavering on whether to raise taxes on the
rich, his failure to adequately explain his positions.
   ``Bush can truly take responsibility for whatever happens on
Tuesday,'' said University of Virginia political scientist Larry
Sabato. ``He created the Democrats' best issue, one that they could
never have created for themselves.''
   ``The Republicans gave the Democrats the ammunition,'' agreed
Rothenberg.
   Analysts were not surprised that pocketbook issues ended up
being pivotal.
   Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said the earlier ``boomlets''
were brief because ``it's hard to sustain a political debate when
there is no debate. Everybody's against drugs. Everybody's against
S&amp;L crooks.''
   The budget, by contrast, is ``a real live issue that really does
raise differences,'' Garin said.
   Others suggested that some Republicans drew the wrong
conclusions from Bush's successful use of patriotism and crime
issues two years ago.
   ``Politicians thought they had learned a lesson from 1988 - the
importance of certain symbols, the Republicans pushing
identification with them and the Democrats trying not to look weak
on them,'' said Rothenberg.
   But those were better days.
   ``Symbolic issues only work in times of peace and prosperity,''
said Sabato. ``Whenever the economy weakens, it always takes first
place on the campaign agenda.''

<HEAD>Putting the Bad News Behind Them</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A remedy for hard times has emerged: Take your
lumps now and put the bad news behind you.
   That was the strategy employed this past week by two big
corporate names, who chose to pay the piper now rather than later.
   General Motors Corp., the nation's largest industrial company,
and Eastman Kodak Co., the 18th biggest, took hefty charges in the
third quarter to put some big problems to rest. The charges turned
profits into losses for both.
   GM, slugging through a slump in auto sales, said it took a $2.1
billion charge to cover the costs of plant closings and other
production cutbacks. The stunning accounting move esulted in a $2
billion loss for the quarter, the largest in automotive history.
   It was a dismal quarter all around for the Big Three automakers.
Ford Motor Co. reported lower than expected earnings, and Chrysler
registered a $214 million loss. Without its charge, GM would have
managed a gain of just $109 million.
   The motivation for Kodak's move was a $909.5 million patent
infringement judgment the company has been ordered to pay rival
Polaroid.
   Kodak officials said that although no money has changed hands
and the case was still under appeal, it was appropriate to book the
charge right away.
   That left the photographic company with a $206 million
third-quarter loss. Earnings would have risen 19 percent to $358
million without the judgment.
   Was the bloodletting good medicine? Wall Street thought so and
registered its approval by bidding up shares of GM and Kodak after
their announcements.
   Experts said the moves went a long way toward wiping the slate
clean for both companies, although they still face stern
competition in a tough economy.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Preparing for the Worst</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Economic worries were prompting companies across the country to
retrench. Citicorp, General Dynamics and Aetna were among several
announcing cutbacks. Many economists said it could be the start of
something ugly.
   ``We haven't had a recession for so long that people forget what
happens,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.
   The news on the economy continued to darken, with the exception
of a surprising government report that pegged economic growth at a
strong 1.8 percent in the third quarter.
   That hopeful report was later overshadowed by a litany of woe
from several sources.
   The government's economic forecasting gauge dropped 0.8 percent
in September, its second straight monthly drop. By conventional
wisdom, three consecutive declines in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators signal a recession.
   The government said unemployment held steady in October at 5.7
percent, but job erosion continued among manufacturing and
construction payrolls. A separate report showed construction
spending in September took its deepest plunge since the 1982
recession.
   A report from the National Association of Purchasing Management
said October was the worst month for manufacturers in eight years.
   Business failures rose by 14.5 percent in the first nine months
of the year, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.
   The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank, said heavy
debts accumulated in the heady 1980s would make a recession longer
and deeper than usual.
   Amid the gloom, the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank,
followed through on a promise to ease credit in response to the
federal budget agreement. The Fed lowered a short-term rate that
banks charge each other for overnight loans, but other interest
rates weren't expected to drop much, unless the Fed relaxes the
credit reins even further.

<HEAD>WALL STREET: More Cuts, Restructurings</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On Wall Street, where cutbacks have been a way of life since the
1987 market crash, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. announced it would lay off
about 6 percent of its investment banking division, a small but
noteworthy cut for one of the Street's most profitable firms.
   In addition, the New York Stock Exchange said it was freezing
executive salaries for 1991 and enacting an early retirement plan
that aims to trim about 8 percent of its staff next year.
   Also during the week, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's biggest
securities firm, announced a restructuring that could put hundreds
out of work over the next several months.

<HEAD>AUTOS: A Pattern Agreement for Chryser</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Countering news of Chrysler's loss for the quarter was the
announcement of its contract agreement with the United Auto Workers
union.
   The company and union reached the pact after 27 straight hours
of bargaining, averting a strike.
   It was a settlement modeled after earlier agreements with GM and
Ford, which pleased the union but left some observers wondering
whether Chrysler could digest it.
   The pact's provisions for job security and protecting the income
of laid-off workers apparently followed the GM-Ford pattern. To
help offset those costs, Chrysler officials said they gained some
flexibility to shift workers' schedules and boost production of the
profitable minivan line.

   Clark confirmed other statements from Miss Brando's deposition,
including her account of the moments after the shooting.
   Shapiro said Miss Brando ``clearly is suffering from serious
mental and emotional problems.''
   Marlon Brando wept last month when he discussed his daughter's
emotional problems, which he said dated to a serious car crash last
year.
   ``Cheyenne has suffered enormously,'' Brando said then. ``She's
been beaten physically. ... She's suffered a head injury where her
face was smashed and she had to have her face remade. She's
suffered a nervous breakdown. She's had to be in a sanitarium under
a doctor's care.''
   In recent weeks, Miss Brando was reported to be out of the
hospital and living with her mother, Tarita.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. said it was laying off
about 6 percent of the investment banking division as rumors
swirled on Wall Street of major cuts at another big firm.
   Morgan Stanley, the second most profitable on Wall Street last
year, said it planned to cut 50 professionals from its worldwide
investment banking staff of 800 by the end of the year.
   Also Thursday on Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange board
froze officers' salaries for 1991 and said it expects to reduce
staffing by about 8 percent next year. Both reductions come during
a prolonged downturn in the financial industry that has seen
thousands of layoffs, management overhauls and reductions in major
business sectors.

   CHICAGO (AP) - The plastic foam boxes that cradle millions of
Big Macs and other sandwiches - boxes an environmentalist called

McDonald's said.
   Under pressure from environmental groups, which say the
clamshell boxes add to the nation's overflowing garbage crisis,
McDonald Corp. President Edward Rensi said Thursday the company had

   Citicorp, General Dynamics, Aetna and General
Motors are only a few of the major employers that announced layoffs
in recent days. Many economists say it could be just the start of a
widespread job scaleback as the economy stalls.
   ``There will be more layoffs, the unemployment rate will rise,
job market conditions will deteriorate for the next six months or
longer,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``We haven't had a recession for so long that people forget what
happens,'' he said.
   Some economists said service jobs may be hit hardest. That's due
partly to the boom in the banking, finance, advertising and other
service industries in the 1980s, which allowed these companies to
grow fat.
   Finance and banking companies ``were basically taking anyone who
could walk through the door,'' said economist Robert Dye of the
Wefa Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   But in the face of increasingly grim economic forecasts and
figures - compounded by the economic shock from the Persian Gulf
standoff - these companies have been letting go of workers in
droves. Citicorp, for one, said it will eliminate 2,000 jobs by the
end of next year.
   ``They grew too fast and this is the consequence of growing too
fast, a shakeout if you will,'' said Kenneth Goldstein, an
economist with the Conference Board, a New York-based business
research group.
   The slowdown among financial companies began with the Wall
Street crash of October 1987, but it since has intensified as small
investors have grown more cautious and avoided the stock and bond
markets.
   The crash, along with the end of the real estate boom and the
spread of the savings and loan crisis, also hurt banks and
insurers. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., for example, plans to
eliminate 2,600 jobs through layoffs and attrition.
   Manufacturing companies have fared somewhat better because they
learned from the last recession eight years ago to keep operations
lean, economists said. But the recent economic sluggishness has
prompted many of them to lay off workers as well.
   In perhaps the largest such cutback, General Motors Corp. said
it would close four plants and idle others temporarily, affecting
thousands of workers. Experts say GM was responding to excess
carmaking capacity as well as to the economy.
   State and local government jobs also are facing cuts due to
withering tax revenues. Reductions are planned by Massachusetts,
Virginia and the city of Pittsburgh, among others.
   Defense cutbacks also are hitting employment. General Dynamics
Corp. said it will lay off 700 to 1,000 workers in January because
of budget cuts and declining demand for the F-16 jet fighters.
   In all industries, middle-management jobs have been particularly
hard hit. Economists say companies are cutting jobs not deemed
crucial or revenue-producing.
   Regardless of the cause, employers should view layoffs as a last
resort, said Martha White, a Chicago-based consultant who helps
troubled companies reorganize.
   ``Because the victims go away during a downsizing or layoffs,
people tend to think the problems go away. But that's not true,
there's always residual fallout in the organization'' in the form
of morale and loyalty problems that can hurt productivity, she
said.
   Some economists said they believe employers announcing layoffs
recently were prompted by actual signs of economic decline, not by
a desire to take pre-emptive action before the downturn worsens.
That means more layoffs are almost certain if the sluggishness
intensifies.
   The Labor Department said last month that 1,127,000 people were
out of work in September due to temporary layoffs, up from 918,000
in June.
   The unemployment rate in September actually was higher for
manufacturing and low-skilled jobs than for white-collar jobs, the
department said.
   For example, the jobless rate for managerial workers was 2.7
percent in September, virtually unchanged from a year earlier. For
low-skill manufacturing jobs it was 7.3 percent, also almost
unchanged from a year ago.
   ``The impression has been created that there are just zillions
of professionals who are suddenly out on the street, but that is
just not the case,'' said Jay Meisenheimer, a Labor Department
economist.
   Private economists are looking to the release Friday of October
unemployment figures for further insight into the economy's
direction. September's overall rate was 5.7 percent, up from 5.6
percent in August.
   Several reports Thursday indicated the economy continues to
slow. In one, a widely watched monthly survey of purchasing
executives indicated that manufacturing fell to its lowest level in
eight years in October.
   In another, the Labor Department said the seasonally adjusted
number of new unemployment claims filed in the week ended Oct. 20
rose to its highest level in seven years.
   But many economists are not forecasting a downturn as severe as
the 1981-82 recession, when unemployment hit 11 percent. Several
say they don't expect unemployment to rise above 7 percent while
others, including the Conference Board's Goldstein, aren't even
predicting a full-blown recession.

   In the throes of a prolonged downturn, another
round of cutbacks is taking shape on Wall Street.
   Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. on Thursday announced 50 layoffs in its
investment banking unit. The New York Stock Exchange froze
executive salaries and targeted an 8 percent staff reduction.
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. expects to cut hundreds of jobs. A First Boston
Corp. spokesman said cuts were expected by year's end.
   The securities industry has been locked in decline since the
1987 stock market crash. Activity in the once-lucrative mergers and
acquisitions area has plummeted. Big-time fees for managing deals
are a thing of the past. Individual investor activity also is down.
   ``If people aren't bringing in business, you're running a
loss,'' said Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. ``You can't sit back and say, `Times will be get
better, we'll just keep the people.'''
   ``With the slowdown we've had, in order to maintain some
semblance of income before taxes you have to let people go,'' Long
said.
   According to Securities Data Co., U.S. merger activity plummeted
52 percent in the first nine months of 1990. Total fees for
securities underwriting, another critical measure of profitability,
plunged to $1.5 billion in the period, the lowest level since 1984.
   ``The roaring profits of the 1980s are a distant memory as Wall
Street undergoes another wave of cutbacks,'' Securities Data said.
   Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Jean Andrews said the firm - Wall
Street's second most profitable last year with $443 million in
earnings - planned to cut 50 professionals from its worldwide
investment banking staff of 800 by the end of 1990.
   She said the cuts would be across the board, including some
senior executives. The investment banking division includes mergers
and acquisitions, corporate finance, real estate and capital
markets.
   ``It's in response to the current and expected business
environment for the industry,'' Andrews said. ``Managing in this
environment, you always look at what resources you commit to these
businesses.''
   Morgan last week reported a 29 percent drop in third-quarter
earnings, to $71.9 million from $101 million in the same 1989
period. The firm attributed the decline to a sharp drop in merchant
banking and investment banking activity.
   In the first nine months of the year, Morgan dropped to sixth
place from first place in 1989 in the total value of merger deals
completed - to $30.9 billion in 89 deals from $83.3 billion in 119
deals.
   At First Boston, rumors circulated widely that the firm was
planning a major restructuring to include hundreds of layoffs in
coming days.
   Also Thursday, the NYSE said it was freezing executive salaries
for 1991 and enacting an early retirement plan in an effort to trim
about 8 percent of its staff next year.
   Earlier this week, Merrill Lynch, the nation's biggest
securities firm, announced a major restructuring that it expects
will lead to hundreds of layoffs.
   And Oppenheimer &amp; Co. this week had the credit rating of some of
its debt downgraded - an especially tough blow because Wall Street
firms rely on short-term loans to sustain daily operations.
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. attributed its action to ``a weak operating
performance due largely to a poor retail market and trading
conditions''
   First Boston workers said talk has focused on staff cuts of up
to 10 percent involving investment banking and back-office
personnel to be announced early next week.
   A First Boston spokesman said the company was reviewing all its
businesses and some cuts were expected by the end of the year. But
the spokesman said reports of a ``D-Day'' for layoffs constituted
``unfounded rumor and speculation.''
   ``It looks like there is a consistent overcapacity vis a vis
customer and client demand. We'll shrink,'' said the spokesman, who
asked not to be identified by name.
   First Boston, a division of CS First Boston Inc., has struggled
because of the slump affecting all of Wall Street as well as large
junk-bond ``bridge loans'' to corporate clients that could not be
refinanced.

   Some of the nation's giant oil companies
suddenly are proclaiming steps to conserve energy and protect the
Earth, in what almost seems a battle over which one can be the
biggest environmentalist.
   Within a 24-hour span this week, four of the majors announced
media efforts with an environmental spin. The greener stance comes
as the industry is disputing charges of price-gouging and
profiteering from the Persian Gulf crisis, but it remained unclear
if the timing was coincidental or intentional.
   As the conservation campaigns got under way, Chevron Corp.
issued a ``Report on the Environment'' that said it's trying to
protect elephants and rhinos in Sumatra.
   Texaco Inc. kicked off a conservation drive called ``Let's Put
Our Energy into Saving It,'' which will include a barrage of print
and broadcast advertising that urges consumers to use less fuel in
cars and homes.
   Exxon Corp. announced it was distributing two types of cleaner
fuel ``to help improve air quality.''
   Amoco Corp., saying ``it's time to think green,'' unveiled a $2
billion package of energy initatives that range from cleaner fuel
to low-fume gasoline pumps.
   Some environmentalists found themselves at a loss for comment
when asked Thursday about the oil companies' new stance. Some
expressed cautious optimism and others questioned the timing of the
media blitz.
   ``I applaud the litle things they do, but they're still a long
way from being green,'' said Michael Francis of The Wilderness
Society. ``They want to keep this nation addicted to oil for one
reason: Their profits.''
   The oil companies disputed contentions they were trying to
polish their image amid the current oil shock, although Texaco
acknowledged that would be a welcome side effect.
   As the companies put forth their environmental messages, they
even acted like they were trying to outdo each other in a
competition over who could be the greenest.
   Chevron's claimed ``a reputation as one of the petroleum
industry's most environmentally responsible companies.''
   Exxon, which became an environmentalist hate-object after the
Valdez oil spill in Alaska, called itself ``the leading producer of
gasolines reformulated to reduce pollution'' with cleaner fuels
available in more than 50 markets.
   Amoco spokesman Neil Geary responded: ``Exxon's talking about
making changes in two grades. Our product in all three grades, in
the Washington, Baltimore and Richmond markets, meets the Clean Air
Act standards for 1992.''
   Amoco's environmental battle plan was unveiled Thursday in a
Washington news confernce at a model full-service gas station
equipped with ``new and more effective Amoco-designed gasoline pump
recovery nozzles, a used motor oil recycling collection facility
for any motorists who change their own oil, and a compressed
natural gas fueling facility for select fleet vehicle use.''
   ``I think we were the only guys with a thoroughly prepared press
conference today,'' Geary said. ``We had vehicles that are actually
dual-fuel. They are able to run on both gasoline and compressed
natural gas. We've already got the pump installed. We had all these
other elements in place. I kind of get the sense other people are
rushing to get stuff out on the wire.''
   Not so, said Texaco, which had its fuel-saving package out in
New York a day earlier.
   ``Our conservation initiative has been in the works for a couple
of months,'' Texaco spokeswoman Anita M. Larsen said. ``We act
independently from other companies. This is not in reaction to what
anyone else is doing.''
   Chevron's media package was in earth tones, on recycled,
recyclable paper.
   Amoco prominently pointed out that its media package also was
made of recycled paper. It went a step further, by including a deck
of cards for playing an Amoco trivia game, ``Environmental
Pursuits.''
   Texaco, however, was not immediately sure whether the paper in
its media package was recycled.
   ``That was pulled from existing stock, whatever we had,'' Ms.
Larsen said.

<HEAD>MGM-Pathe Deal Closes, Finally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp.'s $1.36
billion buyout of MGM-UA is finally a done deal, but whether the
historic studio and its trademark lion will roar again remains
uncertain.
   The new enterprise, like the pending purchase of MCA Inc. by
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., seeks to exploit an
international hunger for Hollywood entertainment. Pathe's holdings
are mainly European.
   But unlike robust Sony Corp., which last year bought Columbia
Pictures Entertainment, Giancarlo Parretti's cash-poor Pathe
labored for months to close the MGM-UA deal.
   Bringing success to the new studio will be a struggle, analysts
say.
   Wall Street experts have said it will take at least $500 million
and several years to revive MGM-UA, whose recent releases range
from hits such as ``Rain Man,'' to box office bombs such as
``Desperate Hours.''
   Pathe has mortgaged its future, said Jessica Reif, an analyst
for First Boston Corp. The new studio's budget and its profits,
Reif said, will be tied up in the sale of foreign, domestic and
home video rights to nearly every movie in the combined
Pathe-MGM-UA libraries for the next 10 years.
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, an executive for a rival
studio said the newly formed MGM-Pathe Communications Co. will need
hit movies fast. He estimated the price paid may have been double
the studio's worth.
   Pathe officials say they paid a fair price and intend to
recapture the once-legendary status of MGM.
   Parretti spokeswoman Arlene Cattani said the Italian financier
took possession of the studio and its Leo the Lion trademark at
11:07 a.m. PST.
   A beaming Parretti later was greeted in his offices with a
surprise from his staff - a real lion named Sudan - to personify
the deal's closing. He gingerly sidled up to the 450-pound brute
for a few quick photographs.
   ``Our goal is to make the MGM lion roar again,'' Parretti said
in a statement. ``We will continue to develop the kind of product
that has made the MGM and UA names legendary for generations, while
building on Pathe's global presence.''
   The buyout pays stockholders of MGM-UA a total of $21.50 per
share. Earlier payments of $4 a share were made this summer.
   Craig Parsons, a spokesman for Pathe, said Parretti would become
chief executive officer. He and his longtime associate, Florio
Fiorini, will be named co-chairmen.
   Pathe Entertainment's Alan Ladd Jr., part of a host of film
executives who headed MGM-UA, will run the new studio, Parsons
said.
   Beverly Hills-based Pathe produces television and feature films.
It also has a variety of European movie-related holdings.
   As part of the complicated transaction, MGM-UA will buy Pathe's
assets for $700 million, raised in part through the sale of rights
to a variety of Pathe, MGM and United Artists film and television
properties. That $700 million will then be used to help buy MGM-UA.
   Independently, Pathe raised $600 million through stock sales to
unidentified European investors.
   Those entities are believed to include Parretti's principal
holding company, Com Finance S.A. of Luxembourg; his Melia
International, one of the world's largest travel agencies; and the
Spanish real estate business Renta Inmobiliaria S.A.
   An earlier MGM-UA sale to Pathe fell apart last spring when Time
Warner Inc. backed out of its agreement to finance $650 million of
the deal.
   Pathe spokesman Parsons said company officials are ``very
comfortable'' with production financing, which will be partially
underwritten by ``one new film a month,'' he said.
   No new debt is involved in the deal, Parsons said. MGM-UA
currently has about $400 million in debt and Pathe owes $300
million.
   For MGM-UA's current management, the future is unclear. Chief
executive Jeffrey Barbakow and studio chief Richard Berger did not
return phone calls seeking comment Thursday.
   MGM-UA majority stockholder Kirk Kerkorian offered the Culver
City-based studio for sale in April 1988.
   A spectrum of suitors - including Japan's Sony and C. Itoh,
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the Walt Disney Co. and the Dutch
conglomerate PolyGram - expressed interest in a deal, lured largely
by the United Artists library, which included the ``Rocky'' and
James Bond movies.

<HEAD>McDonald's Eliminating Plastic Foam Containers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp.'s decision to eliminate plastic
foam containers for its food is being hailed by environmental
groups, but it's no source of joy for a company that recycles that
plastic foam.
   McDonald's president Edward Rensi announced Thursday the goal of
eliminating within 60 days the polystrene boxes that now cradle
millions of the fast-food giant's Big Macs and other sandwiches.
   Under pressure from environmental groups, which say the
clamshell-shaped boxes add to the nation's overflowing garbage
crisis, Rensi said the company had decided ``to do what's right.''
   ``Although some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging
is environmentally sound, our customers just don't feel good about
it,'' Rensi said by telephone from the company's suburban Oak Brook
headquarters. ``So we're changing.''
   The change was sudden. As recently as last week, McDonald's had
been defending the use of plastic foam and was planning to extend
an experimental plastic recycling program to all of its 8,500
restaurants nationwide.
   ``When we learned they were planning to go to comprehensive
recycling, we reacted strongly,'' said Frederic D. Krupp, executive
director of the Environmental Defense Fund, which opposes
polystrene foam use.
   The announced shift to paper containers did not please the
National Polystyrene Recycling Co., which is trying to establish a
nationwide network of plastic foam recycling centers from its
headquarters in suburban Lincolnshire.
   ``NPRC is disappointed to learn that McDonald's has decided to
phase out its use of polystyrene foam packaging,'' said NPRC
president E. James Schneiders. But he said the company can count on
many other sources for its recycling centers.
   Schneiders also said McDonald's has proved to be an important
educational tool in making the public conscious of recycling in
general and plastic recycling in particular.
   A number of U.S. towns and cities have banned the use of
polystyrene foam, saying it not only contributes to landfill
problems, but also contains chemicals that harm the Earth's ozone
level.
   Environmentalists praised Thursday's decision, but a spokesman
for the packaging industry said McDonald's was folding to pressure
that isn't based on fact.
   ``You don't want to get rid of them (polystyrene products) all
together,'' said Joseph Bow, president of the Foodservice &amp;
Packaging Institute in Washington. ``They provide consumers with a
sanitary and timesaving method of food delivery.''
   McDonald's ``is bowing to public pressure that is based on
misperceptions and misinformation,'' said Bow.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in
Washington said her agency had no studies that indicated foam
packaging is environmentally sound.
   On the other hand, said spokeswoman Robin Woods: ``It may not be
an environmental hazard because it's inert. It's not something that
breaks down easily and leaches into landfills, for example.''
   Krupp, though, predicted that McDonald's has begun writing the
industry-wide obituary on polystyrene.
   ``McDonald's understands that the future is green,'' Krupp said.
``I think other companies will follow suit.''
   Jerry Johnson, executive director of the Polystyrene Packaging
Council in Washington, disagreed.
   ``McDonald's is a major user, but they're not that big that they
influence the total market here,'' Johnson said. ``There are still
many places where polystyrene is used - and used because it is one
of the most environmentally responsible materials used in the
packaging industry today.''
   McDonald's vice president Shelby Yastrow said the polystyrene
containers are made for McDonald's by from five to seven companies
- including Amoco Foam Products Co., Mobil Corp., Jen-Pak and
Huntsman Chemical.
   Amoco Foam president John Giroux said 10 percent of his
company's polystyrene sales were to McDonald's.
   First to go will be the plastic foam sandwich boxes, which will
be replaced by paper products manufactured in a new process that
will preserve the food's temperature and freshness, Rensi said.
   The company is still trying to determine suitable replacements
for plastic cutlery and the plastic cups in which coffee is served,
he said.

<HEAD>Iraqi Turmoil Taking Toll on American Jobless Rate, Analysts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The turmoil in the Persian Gulf, which has
taken its toll on the U.S. economy by sending oil prices skyward,
now threatens to worsen the nation's unemployment problems,
analysts say.
   The fallout from Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has left
American businesses skittish about adding employees, according to
private economists.
   ``There's a buttoning up of the overcoats going on,'' said
Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of
Chicago.
   Iraq's continued occupation of Kuwait and the threat of war
``does not make one anxiously go out and hire people,'' Dederick
said.
   Analysts will get their first comprehensive look at the nation's
economic activity for October with today's release of the Labor
Department's unemployment figures for last month.
   In advance of the report, many analysts predicted the jobless
rate inched up from 5.7 percent to 5.8 percent in October, or
possibly even up to 5.9 percent.
   If the unemployment rate did climb last month, it would mark the
fourth straight monthly increase. The nation has not suffered four
consecutive jumps in the jobless rate since 1982.
   Although government data indicates the U.S. economy grew at a
slow annual rate of 1.8 percent in the third quarter of 1990, many
analysts contend the nation slipped into a recession at the tail
end of the July-September period or the start of the current fourth
quarter.
   The recent rise in unemployment - before the jobless rate began
going up in July it had been holding steady for months at 5.3
percent - just offers more evidence of a downturn, analysts said.
   ``What's happening is the economy is rolling into a mild
recession,'' Dederick said.
   A jobless rate of 5.8 percent would mark a three-year high, the
largest level since it reached that level in November 1987.
   Many analysts expected the Labor Department's report to probably
show that the nation's industries lost about 75,000 jobs in
October, a far cry from the 200,000 new jobs the economy was adding
each month last year.
   The nation's manufacturing sector, which has been in a slump for
months, was expected to continue its slide in October. Economic
weakness probably continued to spread to the service sector as
well, analysts said. They noted that the only area in the U.S.
economy that has been booming recently is the health care industry,
which has been adding about 50,000 jobs a month.
   David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, said business leaders' concerns
``intensified after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.''
   But Jones noted that the nation's economy had been staggering
for months, well before the Middle East erupted. ``We were clearly
slipping gradually into recession even before the oil price
shock,'' he said.
   Just in the last week, Citicorp, General Dynamics, Aetna and
General Motors announced layoffs, and many economists said it could
be the start of widespread job cuts as the economy continues to
sputter.
   Many analysts say the only reason the unemployment rate had
stayed at the relatively low and stable rate of 5.3 percent before
July was because the American labor force is growing slowly.

   American Honda Motor Co. Inc. is boosting prices
by about 1.3 percent on ts 1991 model cars over comparably
equipped 1990 models.
   Honda blamed the price increase of $173 per vehicle on
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the
Japanese yen. Prices range from $6,995 for a 1991 Honda Civic
hatchback to $19,795 for an Accord Special Edition 4-door Sedan.
   Honda said Thursday its Accura division also was affected by the
price increases, with 1991 models Integra and NSX costing 1.2
percent more, up $199 per vehicle.
   Prices range from $12,100 for the 1991 Integra RS with a manual
transmission to $17,870 for the 1991 Integra GS with
leather-trimmed interior and automatic transmission. The new NSX
starts at $61,000 for a manual-equipped model, ranging up to
$65,000 for the automatic version.
   Range Rover of North America Inc. also announced price increases
on Thursday. The 1991 version of the British-built sport utility
vehicle will cost 1 percent more than a comparably equipped 1990
model, with prices starting at $42,400.

<HEAD>United, Pan Am Seek Quick Decision On Route Transfer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines and Pan American World Airways
have asked federal regulators to approve quickly United's proposed
purchase of most of Pan Am's trans-Atlantic routes.
   American Airlines Inc., which has objected to the deal, declined
comment on its competitors' request Thursday that the Department of
Transportation approve the transfer of route authorities by Dec.
31.
   Under a $400 million deal announced Oct. 23, United would
acquire all of Pan Am's U.S.-London routes except those landing in
Miami and Detroit; a Washington-to-Paris route; all Pan Am
facilities at San Francisco International, Washington's Dulles
International and London's Heathrow airports; and two Boeing
747-200 passenger jets.
   American Airlines has asked Pan Am's board of directors for an
opportunity to bid on the U.S.-London operations. American Chairman
Robert Crandall suggested in letters to Pan Am's chairman and
directors that the deal could run into regulatory and legal trouble
if Pan Am did not seek higher bids.
   ``At this point, we're going to let those letters stand,'' said
Tom Stack, an American spokesman in the Chicago area.
   He said American's leaders had not yet seen the United-Pan Am
filing and so could not comment on it.
   The Teamsters Airline Division has said it plans to sue Pan Am
for selling the London operations cheap.
   United Chairman Stephen Wolf and Pan Am Chairman Thomas G.
Plaskett said in a joint statement that the proposed deal would
enhance U.S. airline competition in international markets.
   Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported today that the
pilots union at Pan Am is considering making an offer for the Pan
Am Shuttle, which serves the Boston-New York-Washington, D.C.,
corridor.
   Financially-ailing Pan Am Corp. put the shuttle up for sale
earlier this year.
   Without identifying its sources by name, the Journal said the
pilots union might be willing to pay as much as $150 million to
$200 million for the shuttle. The report said the pilots would
contribute as much as $60 million in cash toward the purchase while
borrowing the rest.
   It also said the group would be willing to negotiate with
third-party investors interested in buying the shuttle.
   The report said Pan Am declined commewnt on a possible shuttle
bid from the pilots.

<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped 0.8 percent in September, the government said today,
for its second straight monthly drop.
   The September drop followed a 1.2 percent plunge in August, the
steepest since a 1.4 percent fall a month after the October 1987
stock market crash. The index was unchanged in July.
   Three consecutive declines in the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Economic Indicators are viewed as a fairly reliable -
although not infallible - sign that a recession is imminent.
   In another report, the government said the unemployment rate
held at 5.7 percent in October even though the nation's
manufacturing and construction industries continued to slump. The
index of leading indicators lags a month behind the unemployment
report.
   Although last month's civilian jobless rate was unchanged from
September's 5.7 percent, the Labor Department said the nation's job
market continued to show weakness and widespread job losses.
   There has not been a recession since World War II without the
index of leading indicators turning down for at least three
consecutive months. However, the index was negative for six months
in 1984 and for five months in 1987-88 and, both times, the economy
escaped a recession.
   Many economists who believe the nation's economy is in a
recession are now debating how long it will last and how severe it
will be.
   Even those analysts who say the economy still can skirt a
recession generally agree the current quarter is in a contraction.
A recession generally is defined as two straight quarters of
negative growth.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic activity.
   Nine of the forward-looking indicators pulled the index down in
September.
   They were lower stock prices, a decrease in orders for consumer
goods, an increase in weekly unemployment claims, a decline in
building permits, a drop in an index measuring consumer confidence,
a decrease in unfilled orders, a lower money supply, faster
business delivery times and a decline in the price of raw
materials.
   The only positive contributor was an increase in orders for new
plants and equipment.
   One indicator, the average workweek, was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 143.3 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and down 1.1 percent from its level a year ago.
   Many analysts who contend a recession will be avoided still
express concern the economy may have weakened during the current
quarter.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, said earlier this week that ``we are concerned about a
sluggish fourth quarter and the early part of 1991.''
   Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of
New York, believes the economy will avoid a recession although he
projects a decline in growth during the current quarter.
   However, he added, ``We are not projecting two consecutive
quarters of declining GNP'' - the generally accepted definition of
a recession.
   Roger Brinner, chief economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill in
Lexington, Mass., said he expects a recession starting in the
current quarter, with an economic recovery in the second half of
1991.
   Michael K. Evans of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington said a
``recession will be shallow but extended, with growth remaining
near zero throughout 1991.''
   On the other hand, a survey of 52 economists by the publication
Blue Chip Economic Indicators showed a consensus believed the
economy will decline 0.6 percent this quarter and 0.1 percent in
the first quarter of 1991. The consensus then projected the economy
to edge up 1.2 percent in the second quarter and 2.3 percent and
2.6 percent in the next two.
   Economists with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester,
Pa., said they expect ``the current recession to be mild in
comparison to other post-war recessions. The contraction is
estimated to have begun in August and to end in March 1991, a total
of eight months.''
   ``This is significantly shorter than the 11-month average length
of the six previous post-war recessions,'' they wrote in their
Regional Financial Review.
   But a study for the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think
tank financed partly by labor unions, contends the next recession
will be longer and deeper than normally would be expected due in
large part to consumers' heavy debt.
   This will cause consumers to cut back spending even more sharply
than they otherwise would and thus deepen the contraction, said the
study by Robert Pollin, an economist at the University of
California-Riverside.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. says it is making a new
round of production cutbacks at 11 U.S. and Canadian assembly
plants, moves that will idle more than 27,000 workers.
   Ford Motor Co., meanwhile, will temporarily lay off about 10,600
workers as it shuts down five car and truck assembly plants because
of slow sales.
   Chrysler Corp. is holding production relatively even and has
announced no layoffs or temporary shutdowns for the current
quarter.
   The cuts in fourth-quarter auto production come in the wake of
pessimistic economic forecasts. Early October sales were stronger
than predicted, but automakers are wary.
   ``It doesn't look like sales are falling off the cliff, but
dealers are afraid of carrying big inventories,'' said David Healy,
an auto analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment banking
group in New York.
   The GM cuts are the most extensive by the nation's largest
automaker since last winter. All three of the company's vehicle
groups announced temporary shutdowns.
   Nineteen of the 29 GM plants in the United States and Canada
will be affected by the cuts between now and Christmas.
   Layoffs began Monday at plants belonging to GM's Truck &amp; Bus
Group with the shutdown of two assembly lines in Flint. Second
shift production at the Flint 2 line will end in early January,
idling more than 1,700 workers indefinitely.
   The Pontiac East truck assembly plant as well as plants in
Moraine, Ohio, and Fort Wayne, Ind., will shut down temporarily
next Monday.
   GM's Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group also is shutting the
Corvette assembly plant in Bowling Green, Ky., for two weeks
starting Monday and will reduce production at the plant when the
workers return Nov. 19. Plants in Tarrytown, N.Y., Oklahoma City,
Okla., Arlington, Texas, and Van Nuys, Calif., also will close for
two weeks beginning Monday.
   The cutbacks in Tarrytown include the indefinite layoff of
approximately 450 workers by reducing the speed of the assembly
line, following the temporary shutdown.
   GM of Canada Ltd. will drop one shift at its van plant next
month and will cut production at a truck plant in Oshawa, Ontario,
by 13 percent in early December.
   Cuts at the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group are less extensive
but will involve shutdowns of plants in Wentzville, Mo.,
Wilmington, Del., and the Allante assembly plant in Detroit. The
Wilmington plant also will close for at least one week in December.
   The Lordstown van plant, meanwhile, will shut for approximately
one month Monday, prior to the dropping of a second shift at the
plant now scheduled for Dec. 3.

<HEAD>Eurotunnel Sets Price on New Share Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium which is
digging a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel, announced Friday
it hopes to raise 532 million pounds, or about $1.04 billion, after
expenses through the sale of new shares to existing shareholders.
   The company set the price of each share at 285 pence, or $5.56.
It plans to offer nearly 200 million new shares; there are 332.4
million shares already outstanding.
   The proposed sale price is 34 percent below Eurotunnel's current
price per share of 430 pence, or $8.36, on London's stock market.
   The new shares will begin trading on London's Stock Exchange,
the Paris Bourse and the Brussels Stock Exchange on Nov. 12, the
company said.
   Existing shareholders will be eligible to buy three new shares
for every five they already own, Eurotunnel said. It is also
offering a range of travel perquisites, including limited free
travel, to encourage share purchases.
   The tunnel is scheduled to open in 1993, but the company
projected no dividends until 1999.
   Details of the share offer were released three days after
drillers in one of the project's three tunnels broke through from
the British side to the French side.
   The success of the share sale with investors is a condition for
the release of an additional $4.1 billion in loans agreed to by
banks, which already have put up $9.8 billion.
   The sale has been fully underwritten by a group of British,
American and French financial institutions, Eurotunnel said.
   The consortium previously raised 1.02 billion pounds, or $2
billion, through the sale of stock.
   The 31-mile rail tunnel between Folkestone, England and Calais,
France needs the extra funds because of a 60 percent jump in its
costs, mostly because the rolling stock turned out to be much more
expensive than expected.
   The tunnel now is expected to cost 7.61 billion pounds, or $14.8
billion, up sharply from the initial estimate of 4.87 billion
pounds in 1986.
   This week's breakthrough occurred in the project's service
tunnel, and the first meeting on the two major tunnels should occur
next year.
   When Eurotunnel opens in June 1993 it will carry passengers,
cars and freight between London and Paris in three hours, half the
car-ferry journey time. It expects to transport 28 million people
in the first year.

   The stock market gained ground today, supported
by hopes for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 10.40 to
2,465.35 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 499 up, 401 down and
476 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 205.30 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts found no big surprises in two government reports this
morning that showed new signs of weakness in the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
dropped 68,000 last month, although the civilian unemployment rate
held steady at 5.7 percent.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said its index of leading
economic indicators fell 0.8 percent in September, on top of a 1.2
percent drop the month before.
   Such evidence of a recession continues to drag down corporate
earnings estimates in the financial world. But it has also stirred
talk that the Federal Reserve might soon step up its efforts to
ease credit conditions.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose &rsqb; to 48\;
General Electric gained &rsqb; to 52}; American Express rose &rsqb; to 19&lsqb;,

<HEAD>Steelmaker Hopes to Emerge Soon from Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. hopes to
conclude a reorganization of its debts and emerge from bankruptcy
court protection on Dec. 20.
   Parties to the reorganization, now in its sixth year, will soon
receive ballots and documents related to the proposed settlement,
Wheeling-Pittsburgh spokesman Ray Johnson said Thursday. The
materials were to be mailed today.
   Under a tentative timetable, voting on the reorganization plan
will conclude Nov. 27. A court hearing to confirm will take place
Dec. 6 and Judge Warren Bentz will likely approve it by Dec. 10, he
said.
   ``All of the major creditor constituencies are on board'' and
ready to approve the revised plan of reorganization, said Robert
Sable, an attorney who represented Wheeling-Pittsburgh's unsecured
creditors.
   An original plan of reorganization had to be revised to account
for added costs related to a labor contract the company agreed to
earlier this year.
   When the case concludes, more than $700 million in claims
against Wheeling-Pittsburgh will have been settled.
   The company was helped significantly by changes that occurred
during the years it was under court protection.
   ``It was helped by circumstances - a revival of the economy, a
revival of the steel business and primarily a reduction in
industry-wide capacity,'' Sable said. ``The creditors were patient
and worked it out.''
   Sable said unsecured claims were being sold in 1985 for 12 cents
on the dollar. Under the revised plan of reorganization, holders of
the claims will get more than 60 cents on the dollar in cash.

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose slightly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs that
export sales of soybeans may be picking up as the soybean harvest
winds down.
   Last week's export sales of 437,100 metric tons of soybeans, as
reported by the Agriculture Department, as an improvement over
recent weeks. Analysts said rumors of buying interest from Spain
also prompted buying of futures contracts.
   Speculation continued in the futures markets that President Bush
will soon announce export credits to the Soviet Union that would
allow Moscow to buy U.S. grains and soybean meal.
   Wheat futures were narrowly mixed this morning. Corn futures
were fractionally higher on indications that South Korea bought
100,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to { cent

<HEAD>Japan Concentrating More on Quality of Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is shifting the focus of its technological
prowess from economic growth to a higher quality of life, the
government says in an annual assessment that provides some insight
into the nation's self-image.
   The Science and Technology Agency's report, released in October,
emphasizes that Japan has matured into a leading economic giant,
producing 14 percent of the world's goods and services, largely due
to scientific and technological achievements.
   The report also emphasizes that much of the progress Japan
engendered is enjoyed abroad instead of home, where millions of
Japanese historically have scrimped and saved.
   But now, the report says, ``the people's consciousness has been
transformed in the midst of this economic prosperity, and they now
wish to live their lives in comfort and fulfillment.''
   It says Japan still lags far behind Europe and the United States
in areas of technology related to housing, as well as facilities
for elderly and handicapped people.
   Robert Broadfoot, managing director of Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy in Hong Kong, said Japanese are strongly aware of
the gap in quality of life between their nation and countries like
the United States, despite Japan's wealth.
   ``Money doesn't mean that much now, with the possibility of
rapid market fluctuations. But quality of life is something real,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   Nobuaki Teraoka, an aide at the Science and Technology Agency's
policy bureau, said: ``Until now, the use of science and technology
in Japan has emphasized pursuit of economic development. But now we
are at the point where we need to shift our focus to the pursuit of
fuller lives.''
   The annual report said Japan spent about 2.85 percent of its
gross national product on research and development last year,
slightly below West Germany's 2.87 percent. United States' spending
dropped to an estimated 2.53 percent of GNP, it said.
   The report said Japan spent 9.8 trillion yen, or $77 billion, on
research and development in 1989, an increase of 46 percent in real
terms over the previous five years. Including research on
humanities and social sciences, the total was 10.6 trillion yen, or
$83 billion.
   Despite the image overseas of large Japanese government
subsidies for technological research, public funding once again
provided a far smaller portion of Japan's total research and
development expenses in 1989 than in other major nations.
   Of total research spending, the report said, only 19.9 percent
was government-funded, vs. 47.4 percent in the United States and
33.2 percent in West Germany.
   Instead, ``the very extensive research effort by private
companies'' has resulted in technological progress that accounted
for two-fifths of Japan's economic growth during the past 10 years,
said Yoshiki Kurihara, director of the policy bureau's research
division.
   The report called for more government spending, particularly for
basic research that private industry can rarely undertake because
it is either extremely risky or requires a big investment in time.
   In 1989, Japan had 462,000 researchers - 535,000 including
humanities and social sciences - a 25 percent increase from five
years earlier. In the sciences, 294,000 worked for private
industry, 132,000 for universities and 36,000 for government
research institutes.
   It said the United States had about 806,000 researchers and West
Germany 166,000, including those in humanities and social sciences.

<TEXT>
   The bottlers of bubbly Perrier water reported
Friday that net profits more than doubled in the first half of 1990
despite a worldwide recall after dangerous chemicals turned up in
some samples.
   The profit increase came mostly from the sale of the group's
soft-drink operations, Source Perrier SA said.
   First-half volume sales of the popular mineral water were down
14 percent from 1989 and revenue slipped 3 percent due to the
recall and delays in restocking the beverage, Source Perrier said.
   Consolidated net profits amounted to 856 million francs, or $167
million, up from 397 million francs a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first half fell to 8.302 billion francs, or
$1.62 billion, compared with 8.541 billion francs in 1989.
   The latest results included a gain on the sale of its soft-drink
operations as the company shifted its focus back to the
green-bottled mineral water.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration discovered traces of the
cancer-causing chemical benzene in bottles of Perrier in January,
leading to a recall of millions of bottles worldwide.
   Perrier said the contamination occurred from a dirty filter on a
gas line at the spring in Vergeze, southern France.
   The discovery that Perrier added gas to boost the water's
natural fizz forced the company to drop claims on its labels that
the water sparkled naturally.
   Benzene-free Perrier went back on the shelves in the United
States and Europe by mid-April.
   The sale of the soft-drinks unit and other non-strategic assets
for 1 billion francs, or $195 million, more than offset the cost of
the recall, the statement said.
   Perrier did not list the recall costs, but specified that a
provision of 435 million francs, or $85 million, was set aside for
it in the 1989 accounts.

<HEAD>Tax-Exempts Getting More Popular With Higher Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher taxes are making tax-exempt mutual funds
more popular as investors move past big credit-troubled municipal
issuers like Massachussetts, New York City and Philadelphia.
   Bolstered by the new tax law that gives few income tax breaks
and higher rates, more investors seeking high-quality municipal
debt issuers are putting money in tax-free mutual funds.
   With higher taxes, their reasons are obvious.
   A tax free bond fund that yields 7 percent has a tax-equivalent
yield of 9.7 percent for an investor in the 28 percent tax bracket.
But if that investor lands into the new 31 percent bracket, the tax
equivalent yield on the same 7 percent fund rises to 10.1 percent.
   That kind of math may be popular among investors who have become
wary of the high-risk double-digit yeilds of the junk bond funds.
   ``It is clear that demand for municipal bonds will be strong
enough to make tax-exempts the most stable - as well as the most
attractive - investments in today's market,'' said Siesel E.
Canaday, Jr, vice president of municipal underwriting at John
Nuveen &amp; Co. Inc., an investment banking firm.
   Some bond funds are reporting brisker sales of the tax-exempts.
   At Vanguard Group, in Valley Forge, Pa., municipal mutual funds'
net cash inflow increased sevenfold in October over September, said
Brian Mattes, a spokesman. Some of that, he said, may be a result
of investors anticipating tax increases.
   Fidelity Investments says net inflows are running at the highest
levels this year, comparable to the peak season following the tax
return deadline.
   ``They're reacting to threats of increasing taxes on federal
level and on state level as well,'' said Heidi Baxter, marketing
manager of Fidelity's state tax-free funds.
   Despite the horror stories about credit problems in the
Northeast and fears that a recession would strike cities and states
particularly hard, investors have been willing to invest in the
municipal market when they can find quality.
   ``If people are looking for quality they have the opportunity to
still earn very attractive yeilds. Quality is a consideration, you
just have to be more selective,'' Ms. Baxter said.
   But as a result of their popularity, the tax-free funds' main
attraction may be diminished. Increased demand, coming at a time of
relatively short supply, will likely bid up the price of municipal
bonds, causing yields to fall.
   Helped by the higher tax bracket, the municipals have quite a
way to go before their tax-equivalent yields fall into the range of
most low-risk taxable investments.
   For now, though, the yields are there and the bond funds are
ready.
   The increased business could be a good sign for an industry that
has been sagging since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The Investment Company Institute reported last week that total
sales of long-term municipal funds, including reinvested dividends,
fell $275.3 million from August to $968.2 million in September.
   At Oppenheimer, where officials are discussing advertising their
tax-free funds more, Sam Friedman, president of Oppenheimer
shareholder services, said nobody wants to get too excited until
the federal budget agreement is signed.
   ``A lot of people are jumping on the bandwagon, although I think
its a good bandwagon to get on,'' he said.

<HEAD>Data General Reports Quarterly Loss Of $89.3 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp. said Friday it lost
$89.3 million, or $2.93 per share, in its fourth fiscal quarter
because of a charge related to the computer maker's consolidation
efforts in August.
   The loss for the quarter ended Sept. 29 included a $71.7 million
restructuring charge for the corporatewide consolidation, Data
General announced.
   During the same quarter last year, Data General reported an
$84.1 million loss, or $2.86 per share. That loss included an $80
million restructuring charge.
   Data General posted a fourth-quarter operating loss of $88.2
million, incuding the restructuring charge, compared with an
operating loss of $82.2 million for the same quarter last year.
   Revenue for the fourth quarter totalled $308.5 million, down
from $357.1 million a year earlier.
   For fiscal 1990, the company reported a loss of $139.8 million,
or $4.65 a share, including the restructuring charge. In fiscal
1989, the company reported a loss of $119.7 million, or $4.10 a
share, including that year's restructuring charge.
   The operating loss for its fiscal 1990 was $132.6 million,
compared with $127.4 million in fiscal 1989.
   Revenue for 1990 totaled $1.22 billion, compared with $1.31
billion in fiscal 1989.
   Data General also announced that sales of its Aviion open-system
computers grew significantly, in part because of a $45 million
contract with a division of U.S. Sprint and a $15 million contract
with Computer Sciences Corp.
   ``During 1990, the first full year of shipments, Aviion systems
produced revenues of more than $100 million, showing sequential
increases each quarter,'' said Ronald L. Skates, Data General's
president. ``We are confident that Aviion revenues will continue to
increase significantly in fiscal 1991.''

   The stock market showed a broad gain today,
supported by hopes for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 26.49 to
2,481.44 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 988 up, 481 down and
450 unchanged.
   Analysts found no big surprises in two government reports this
morning that showed new signs of weakness in the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
dropped 68,000 last month, although the civilian unemployment rate
held steady at 5.7 percent.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said its index of leading
economic indicators fell 0.8 percent in September, on top of a 1.2
percent drop the month before.
   Such evidence of a recession continues to drag down corporate
earnings estimates in the financial world. But it has also stirred
talk that the Federal Reserve might soon step up its efforts to
ease credit conditions.

   Lehman Brothers Securities, the British arm of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., on Friday filed a claim of 18.5
million pounds, or $36 million, against Polly Peck PLC Chairman
Asil Nadir for failure to pay for share purchases.
   Lehman Brothers said in a brief statement it hadf submitted the
claim to the High Court in London, joining an earlier petition
filed last week by Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. seeking 3.6 million
pounds, or $7 million in unpaid fees.
   Lehman Brothers claims Nadir hadn't paid for 6.25 million Polly
Peck shares purchased Sept. 4-6.
   The petition seeks to force payment from the embattled Polly
Peck executive through liquidation of personal assets.
   The two filings are personal claims against the Polly Peck
executive. The company last week obtained court protection from its
creditors while it works out its 1.3 billion pounds ($2.5 billion)

   A Japanese business group that

Ski Resort in South Lake Tahoe, Calif., the resort's owner said
Friday.
   Heavenly would become the third ski resort under control of
Kamori Kanko Co. Ltd. of Sapporo City, Japan. It also owns Rusutsu
Kogen ski resort near Sapporo City, site of the 1972 Winter
Olympics, as well as a koala park in Australia and restaurants,
golf courses, zoos and amusement parks in Japan.
   The company bought Steamboat for a reported $110 million in
1989. No purchase price was announced for Heavenly Valley.
   The announcement was made by resort owner Bill Killebrew, who
will stay on as general manager. Martin Hart, former owner and
current president of the Steamboat ski resort, will be Heavenly's
chairman, while all 120 year-round employees also will be retained.
   Heavenly Valley has 24 lifts over 20 square miles of private and
leased land.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans sold off late in the
session amid disappointment that President Bush did not announce
export credits to the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures ended moderately higher while corn futures rose
slightly.
   The soybean market rallied early, extending Thursday's gains, on
speculation that President Bush would announce export credits to
the Soviets during a campaign swing through the Midwest on Friday.
   Some analysts reasoned that Bush might announce the credits,
which would allow Moscow to buy U.S. grain and soybeans, to help
boost the chances of Republican candidates from the Midwestern farm
states.
   But the president made no mention of export credits on his swing
through the region, prompting disappointed selling of soybean
futures, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2\ cents to 4} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.66 a bushel; corn
was \ cent to 2 cents higher with December at $2.30 a bushel; oats

<HEAD>Continental President Says Airline May Have to Sell International
Routes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soaring fuel costs could force financially
strapped Continental Airlines to sell some international routes and
prompt layoffs if the carrier wants to avoid another round of
bankruptcy reorganization, its president said.
   One plan under consideration is the sale of Continental's Air
Micronesia, the carrier's Pacific service operated from its hub in
Guam. Air Micronesia holds the authority to fly from Honolulu to
Tokyo.
   ``That is worth doing if it allows us to continue with a viable
airline,'' Continental president Hollis Harris said Thursday in an
appearance before a group of Houston businessmen.
   Such a sale could mean the end of Continental's
Houston-Honolulu-Tokyo route. Continental still would have the
ability to fly to Honolulu, but the most lucrative leg of the trip
is from Honolulu to Japan.
   Continental began Tokyo service just four months ago after a
24-year effort to get direct air access between Houston and Japan.
   Officials at Delta Airlines, Harris' former employer, have
confirmed they are looking at some assets Continental has for sale,
but won't say what kind of deal the Atlanta-based carrier is
interested in pursuing.
   Harris, who recently took over at Continental, said layoffs were
possible but he hoped such moves, as well as cuts in wages and
benefits, could be avoided.
   A 20 percent cut in salaries would save about $16 million a
month. Harris, however, said the savings would not be worth the
toll on employees.
   ``Their morale would just go down the drain,'' he said. ``They
would be so depressed, we'd run off more revenue than we would
save.''
   Analysts note Continental, which employs 37,000 nationwide,
already has low labor costs.
   ``According to my cash flow work, they need to sell assets to
provide a cushion large enough to not have liquidity problems,''
said Paul Karos, an analyst with First Boston Corp.
   Continental already is negotiating the sale of its Houston
airline food service operation, Chelsea Catering, which employs 800
at its Houston kitchen.
   On Friday, Continental and Dallas-based Electronic Data Systems
broke off talks on a multibillion-dollar deal through which the
airline would have relinquished control of its computerized
reservation system.
   One reason cited was the increase in fuel prices caused by
uncertainty in the Middle East.
   Last week, Continental's board of directors, faced with monthly
fuel bills that have risen $70 million since July, considered
filing for bankruptcy protection. Continental previously filed for
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws in 1983.
   Instead, directors opted to sell off assets and undertake
whatever measures necessary to remain afloat.
   Harris said airlines need an additional 10 percent increase in
ticket prices to offset the jump in fuel costs, but he doesn't
think the flying public would tolerate such increases.

<HEAD>Government, Eurotunnel Trying to Sell Billions in Stock in Jittery
Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bargain prices and generous inducements will be
the keys to success for $10 billion worth of securities the
government and Eurotunnel are trying to sell in a jittery market.
   Eurotunnel is asking shareholders who already have bought $2
billion worth of stock to take up another $1 billion to ensure
completion of a rail tunnel beneath the English Channel.
   Meanwhile, the government is about to sell Britain's 12 regional
electricity distribution companies for an expected 4 billion to 5
billion pounds, or $7.8 billion to $9.8 billion. It's the biggest
and most complex privatization yet, and has been in the works for
months.
   Incentives have been offered for both. Eurotunnel announced
Friday it would sell the extra stock at 285 pence ($5.56) each, an
unusually large 34 percent discount to the market price. It also
offered perks such as free travel through the tunnel for 49 years
for those who buy at least 1,500 shares.
   Analysts said the discount demonstrates the Anglo-French
consortium's fear that shareholders might reject the stock when it
starts trading Nov. 12.
   The government, meantime, is including a two-year installment
plan among its inducements for the privatization, whose price will
be announced Nov. 21. The government has also begun an aggressive
marketing drive that includes television advertisements.
   Such perks are necessary, given the uncertainty surrounding the
London market, said Anthony Winnington, director of equity sales at
the London investment firm Hoare Govett Ltd.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, low corporate earnings, a faltering
British economy and political turmoil in Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government have been blamed for the market's jitters.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index has fallen 384
points since mid-July.
   ``The appetite with cash-rich institutions for new equity even
at a discount at the market is not terribly strong because of the
uncertainty in the Middle East and the threat we could see a
200-point drop in prices overnight,'' Winnington said.
   ``I think the government has to make sure that the electricity
issue is priced low enough'' to assure success on the London
market, said Richard Jeffrey, an economist with Hoare Govett.
   The government's $64 billion worth of privatizations over the
years have been largely successful, with the exception of the
government's remaining one-third stake in British Petroleum Co.
PLC.
   The BP sale coincided with the October 1987 stock market crash
and flopped.
   At a news conference Friday, Energy Secretary John Wakeham
denied that the government was ``giving away'' the electricity
companies.
   But Ernie McKnight, a British equity manager for Glasgow-based
Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, said that since the
government wants to sell off the electricity generating companies
next year, ``they can't afford to fail.''
   ``If the Gulf situation escalates I think the market reaction
will be negative and it's obviously more difficult to place large
quantities of stock in a falling market,'' he said.
   The stakes are high for Eurotunnel, too. The sale's success with
shareholders is a condition for the release of an additional $4.1
billion in loans by banks.
   The 50-mile tunnel, which is to open in 1993, needs the extra
funds because of a nearly 60 percent jump in its overall cost to
7.61 billion pounds, or $14.8 billion.
   Eurotunnel Deputy Chairman Alastair Morton said earlier this
week that the sale had been timed to coincide with Tuesday night's
confidence-inspiring breakthrough by diggers on the first of the
project's three tunnels.
   Optimistic about the sale, he noted that Eurotunnel's offer
comes before the government's.
   The governments says 6 million people have registered to buy
electricity shares, and the Eurotunnel sale is fully underwritten
by investment firms.
   But many recent issues have been left in the hands of
underwriters, and not many companies have been trying to sell new
stock for months, Winnington said.
   Institutional investors held some 29 billion pounds ($57
billion) in cash in the third quarter compared with 22 billion
pounds ($43 billion) a year ago, Jeffrey said. Sales of new stock
have fallen to 660 million pounds ($1.3 billion) from 1.6 billion
pounds ($3.1 billion), he said.

<TEXT>
   Act III Communications Inc. has suspended
publication of The Marketer and is seeking a buyer for the monthly
magazine for senior marketing executives that was launched only
this past April.
   Robert C. Gardner, president of Act III Publishing, said Friday
the move reflects te parent company's decision to deemphasize
magazine publishing and focus resources on its other businesses -
TV stations, production of TV shows and theater operations.
   Act III Communications, based in Los Angeles, is privately held
and headed by television producer Norman Lear, best known for the
classic TV series ``All in the Family.'' It owns eight TV stations
and about 550 movie screens.
   Last month, Act III sold the trade monthly Marketing &amp; Media
Decisions to a subsidiary of BPI Communications Inc. that owns
Adweek magazine. BPI, an affiliate of the owner of the Boston
Globe, said it planned to make the magazine a weekly starting next
year.
   Remaining magazine titles owned by Act III Publishing are
Channels, which appears every other week and covers the television
industry; the music industry monthlies Mix and Electronic Musician;
and the international television magazines Television Business
International and World Broadcast News.
   Asked whether its other magazines are for sale, Gardner said he
was ``not commenting on it'' but added that the company was making
``selective decisions as we go along here.''
   The Marketer will be suspended after the November issue, which
appears Nov. 7. The company said ``negotiations are ongoing with
several potential buyers of the publication and that an
announcement is expected shortly.''
   Gardner declined to identify any potential buyers or say how
many there were, but said chances for a sale of the magazine are
``extremely good.''
   The Marketer was sent free to 45,000 senior marketing
executives, and Gardner said it was ``doing very well'' for a
startup magazine.
   It had employed about a dozen editorial and advertising
staffers.
   The suspension of the magazine comes amid what many analysts are
calling an advertising recession in the publishing business. Ad
volume has slumped at many magazines and several magazines have
halted publication.
   This week alone, Knight-Ridder Inc. said it was ceasing
publication of Runways, a news magazine devoted to the commercial
aviation industry, and Goldhirsh Group suspended publication of
Business Month magazine, a business news and feature magazine whose
roots extended to 1893.
   Both publications cited a lack of advertising support.

<TEXT>
   British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher was furious.
   She demanded to know how the European Community could map out
grandiose schemes to become a United States of Europe when it
couldn't even end an impasse over reducing government farm payments
in world trade talks.
   ``It is very urgent indeed because if we do not get agreement on
agriculture it will give a signal to the world that the community
is protectionist,'' she said at a recent summit of the 12 trading
bloc nations.
   The nearly month-old dispute, pitting Britain against France and
Germany, has threatened the collapse of the Uruguay Round
negotiations, an ambitious four-year effort to lower trade barriers
in about 100 nations and give a hefty boost to the world's economy
in the next century.
   ``It's jeopardizing the success of the trade talks,'' said Anna
Murphy, research fellow at the Brussels-based Center for European
Policy Studies.
   Agriculture is only one of 15 areas under discussion in the
trade negotiations, which began in 1986 in the Uruguayan resort of
Punta del Este.
   But the United States, Australia, Argentina and others insist it
holds the key to expanding trade in other areas, including
textiles, manufactured goods and services, such as
telecommunications and banking. Some nations threaten to quit if
nothing is done on agriculture.
   Jeffrey Schott, research fellow at the Institute of
International Economics in Washington, said the EC is isolated in
its seeming unwillingness to reduce subsidies.
   The final round of negotiations begins in just four weeks.
   Yet, the community has not submitted its farm offer for
bargaining in the talks, held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and an accord for freer
world trade.
   Its member nations have been unable to endorse a proposal to
trim subsidies on major farm crops by 30 percent over 10 years,
starting in 1986. Some reductions already have been made so
analysts estimate cuts in the coming years would amount to 10
percent to 15 percent.
   Agriculture and trade ministers of the community nations will
meet Monday in a seventh attempt to back the plan.
   But, Schott said, ``even if it were to be approved by the
ministers, it would be dead on arrival.''
   Other nations, including the United States, have dismissed the
proposed reductions as insufficient.
   ``What worries the United States and (other nations is) that the
community won't go any further than that, and that isn't enough as
far as they're concerned,'' said Ms. Murphy.
   The Bush administration asked trading partners to slash farm
income supports by 75 percent and export subsidies by 90 percent
over a 10-year period, starting in 1991.
   Andre Herlitska, secretary-general of the European farm lobby
COPA, thinks that ``there is a big part of bluff'' in the American
proposal.
   The United States contends it wants to put agriculture trade on
a more free-market footing.
   ``We must let farmers compete with farmers, instead of farmers
competing with the deep pockets of government treasuries,''
President Bush said recently.
   European farmers are skeptical.
   ``We don't believe blind market forces are the best instruments
to (ensure) market stability,'' said Herlitska.
   Farm assistance is costly.
   Industrialized nations spent $251 billion on agricultural
subsidies last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development has estimated. Of that, the European Community spend
$97.5 billion and the United States spent $67.2 billion.
   The community has pared its support programs in recent years,
making the prospect of further trims unpalatable to its 10 million
farmers, more than three times as many as in the United states.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who faces his nation's 1 million
farmers in elections on Dec. 2, has said the community's proposal
goes too far. He wants compensatory measures to offset any income
losses to farmers.
   France, where 2.2 million farmers produce much of the
community's agriculture exports, has balked at any move to snip
export aids, which enable the Europeans to sell high-priced goods
on the world markets.
   It also wants to maintain a system of taxes and other measures
that encourage trading bloc nations to shun imports and buy
home-grown crops.
   Farmers complain they have been hit hard in recent years by poor
prices, government limits on production, bad weather, food safety
scares and a flood of cheap products from Eastern Europe.
   ``There is a trend toward declining income ... The situation is
very bad,'' said Herlitska.
   Farmers have sometimes turned to violence to underscore their
complaints.
   In France, demonstrators this fall hijacked livestock trucks,
mostly from Britain, and slaughtered the animals inside.
   French President Francois Mitterrand was forced to cancel an
inaugural ride on a new stretch of high-speed rail track when
farmers barricaded the line.
   Kohl was booed by several thousand farmers at a recent campaign
rally. He professed to have ``much understanding for your worries''
and promised budget measures to do something about shrinking
pocketbooks.
   Despite these pressures, the community disputes its image as the
bad guy in the Uruguay Round and insists it wants the n,0153

<HEAD>Son of Nobel Laureate Appeals Sentence on Fake Bomb Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of Archbishop Desmond
Tutu went before a magistrate Friday to appeal an 18-month sentence
for making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg's international
airport.
   Defense attorney P. Wilson argued that Trevor Tutu made the bomb
threat to test security at Jan Smuts Airport and said the sentence
was ``shocking'' for a first-time offender.
   Wilson also said police did not take the threat seriously
because they did not search the terminal for an hour.
   The magistrate reserved judgment.
   During the Dec. 31, 1988, incident, Tutu told police he had a
bomb in his luggage. Tutu later told reporters his action was part
of a publicity stunt for his advertising agency. He has been free
pending appeal.
   Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight
against apartheid.

   Chicago's futures exchanges have agreed to help guide the

   Their mission: to transfer to the Soviet Union the market
concepts and trading techniques that make visitors to the floors of
the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange feel
that they are walking through the beating heart of capitalism.
   The operation won't be easy. The Moscow exchange, started in
May, reportedly runs in fits and starts, opening the trading floor
only when enough commodities have been brought to market to justify
a session.
   The Chicago Tribune reported that during this past week's visit
to the Moscow market by Chicago exchange officials, the goods on
the block included 2,000 tons of Russian cement, a shipment of
Japanese videotapes and radio-telephones, and a few million Winston
cigarettes.
   The products were auctioned off by an exchange officer to
traders who stood around him in a circle and shyly raised their
hands to signal their acceptance of an offer, the Tribune reported.
   That scene is a far cry from the Chicago trading floors, where
traders crowd into specially constructed ``pits'' and deal directly
with each other by shouting out bids and offers and gesturing
furiously in a deafening and seemingly chaotic maelstrom.
   But the object of the Chicago and Moscow commodity markets is
the same: to provide a place for buyers and sellers to come
together and set the prices of goods.
   Like the Moscow exchange, the Chicago exchanges began as markets
for physical commodities - farmers actually brought their grain to
the Chicago Board of Trade to sell.
   But after 140 years, Chicago's exchanges have evolved into
futures markets where traders exchange contracts that represent the
commodities. The system also allows the exchanges to offer an
ever-widening array financial products such as government bond and
stock-index futures.
   The Moscow exchange is close to where the Chicago Board of Trade
was in 1948, which is why the Moscow market officials looked to
Chicago for assistance in creating an exchange that will help push
the Soviet Union toward a market economy and away from one in which
prices are set by the government.
   The creation of a Moscow futures market also could help open the
Soviet Union up further as a market for U.S. products.
   In documents signed Thursday and Friday, the Board of Trade and
Chicago Merc agreed to provide educational and research support to
the Moscow Commodities Exchange.
   ``We are honored to be playing so significant a role in this
historic undertaking,'' said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's
executive committee, in a statement.
   ``While the process of moving from a controlled economy and
fixed exchange rates to a free economy based on supply and demand
is difficult and will take a protracted period of time, the
contributions of commodity markets toward this process will be
significant.''
   Board of Trade President Thomas Donovan said the Moscow
exchange, like the Chicago markets, arose out of a need for more
efficient allocation of basic commodities.
   ``Over a span of some 20 years in the mid-19th century the
Chicago Board of Trade developed the most efficient system ever,
the futures market. We will see it happen again in the Soviet
Union,'' Donovan said.
   ``With the help of the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, it won't take 20 years,'' he said.

   Hopes for lower interest rates provided the
spark for a broad advance in stock prices today.
   Analysts found no big surprises in two government reports this
morning that showed new signs of weakness in the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
dropped 68,000 last month, although the civilian unemployment rate
held steady at 5.7 percent.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said its index of leading
economic indicators fell 0.8 percent in September, on top of a 1.2
percent drop the month before.
   Such evidence of a recession continues to drag down corporate
earnings estimates in the financial world. But it has also stirred
talk that the Federal Reserve might soon step up its efforts to
ease credit conditions.

<TEXT>
   As the Persian Gulf crisis turned three months
old Friday, oil prices fell a little more than $1 a barrel in a
weary futures market that traders said has lost its enthusiasm for
going wild on news and rumors.
   ``They're not looking at every headline now and saying, `Buy,
because Saddam said this,''' said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy
analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
``They're waiting for something real.''
   Light sweet crude oil for December delivery closed at $34 per
barrel, down $1.17, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts
for delivery in later months also settled lower.
   For the week, crude for near-term delivery rose 99 cents. Oil
traders said it has been by far the slowest week they have seen
since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``You're in a very narrow range on very light volume,'' said
trader Ed Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Analysts attributed Friday's drop to perceptions that President
Bush's latest comments about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were
softer than a day earlier.
   Bush has been attacking Saddam sharply most of the week, but
traders have paid little attention because the comments have come
on the campaign trail, where the president is stumping for
Republicans running in Tuesday's elections.
   ``If he's out there campaigning and he's down in Florida, can he
really start a war from there?'' Blakeslee said.
   Petroleum products also fell Friday.
   Unleaded gasoline dropped 3.09 cents to 89.21 cents per gallon
for December delivery, with later months also down. The near-term
contract finished the week down 2.26 cents.
   Home heating oil fell 2.95 cents to 87.42 cents a gallon for
December delivery. Later contract months were all lower. For the
week, heating oil dropped .83 cent.
   Natural gas for December delivery settled at $2.358 per 1,000
cubic feet Friday, up .8 cent from Thursday.

<HEAD>Chrysler, Fiat Call Off Joint Venture Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The shaky economy caused Chrysler Corp. and Fiat
SpA to call off months of talks about possible joint ventures or
other business arrangements, the No. 3 U.S. automaker and the
Italian company said Friday.
   ``Uncertainties in the global economy, rising oil prices brought
on by the crisis in the Gulf, the slowdown in sales in both the
U.S. and European automotive markets and the overall deterioration
in worldwide business conditions created overwhelming obstacles,''
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said.
   ``Today, we have to realize that the world economic scenario is
plagued with uncertainty, and that synergies and mutual advantages
cannot be pursued,'' said Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat Group.
   Rumors of talks between the two automakers had been swirling
since June, although Chrysler and Fiat declined to comment until
Iacocca confirmed in August that the two companies were
negotiating.
   ``We discovered some strong potential opportunities for working
together and some outstanding operational synergies that could have
benefited both companies,'' Iacocca recalled on Friday.
   Speculation had run the gamut from Fiat buying a large share of
Chrysler, to an agreement to cooperate on a small sport-utility
vehicle.
   Fiat spokesman Gualberto Ranieri confirmed on Friday that
discussions included potential production agreements, commercial
and distribution arrangements and equity investments.
   But the companies concluded that the time wasn't right, he said.
   Chrysler reported dismal third-quarter results on Monday - a
$214 million loss on revenues of $6.5 billion.
   The loss, however, was expected, and Mary Ann Sudol, an analyst
with Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York, instead blamed world
economic uncertainty for scuttling the talks.
   ``With the war in the Mideast that could affect oil and gasoline
prices, and the murky geopolitical and economic situation, they
might end up regretting any capital commitment, particularly if it
were going to be very product specific,'' Sudol said.
   She said the companies earlier had ruled out a possible equity
investment in Chrysler by Fiat but had refused to elaborate further
on the talks. ``They really kept the lid on,'' she said.
   Ranieri did not rule out a resumption of talks if world economic
conditions stabilize. ``Everything is possible,'' he said.
   The companies said they would continue their existing business
arrangements, including some component deals and Chrysler's
marketing of Alfa Romeo cars in North America.
   Chrysler stock closed up 37{ cents Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, at $11.37{ per share.

<TEXT>
   For these economists, the picture always is
bright - out of this world, you might say. That's because when it
comes to business, astro-economists turn to the stars.
   They look at the rise of the moon, gravitational forces of Venus
and Jupiter, and Earth's tidal flows and weather patterns to
forecast the future of economic trends ranging from unemployment to
gold prices.
   Spacey?
   Not to these high rollers, er, astro-economists.
   This weekend about 150 of them are in Chicago for the Third
Annual World Conference on Astro-Economics.
   Say what?
   ``When most people hear about astro-economics, they go,
`What?''' Robert Hand, creator of a computer program overlaying
star charts with stock market fluctuations, said Friday.
   ``I think that there is a great deal of incredulity,'' he said,
``but the proof is in the pudding in that people who use it make
money.''
   Among the lecture topics at the conference, for which each
attendee paid $170: ``Geocosmic and Rhythmic Cycles in Today's
Precious Metals Markets,'' ``Astrological Technical Analysis,'' and
``Hot Stocks for the Coming Year.''
   Over the coming months, Hand said, he foresees a bottoming out
in the stock market and recession-like trends.
   Critics might argue it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
predict such events.
   Take, for example, Robert Eisner, a William R. Kenan professor
of economics at Northwestern University in Evanston. He calls
astro-economics ``garbage, unequivocally.''
   ``Unless you have some theory about how stars relate to economic
activity - and I'm not aware of any good one - it's
inconceivable,'' Eisner said.
   ``Of course, the stars will do no worse, on average will do
about the same, and sometimes will do better on Wall Street than
any speculating would.''
   Still, Hand insists that to predict the economic future within
80 percent to 90 percent certainty proves the practice works.
   Grace Morris, an astrologer and psychoanalyst who co-sponsored
the weekend conference in Chicago, defended the pseudoscience.
   She said skeptics should note astrology predicted Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait - precipitated by a lunar eclipse, a
stress-causing event on any planet.
   Morris said she uses astrology to advise businesses on the
proper timing for startups, new product introductions and corporate
takeovers.
   ``Virgo companies like Texaco and Coca-Cola will do very well in
late 1991,'' she said. ``Jupiter will move into Virgo after
September of 1991, and Jupiter symbolizes the expansion of
business.''
   Astrology has been a subject of fascination for years, studied
by U.S. presidents beginning with George Washington and Thomas
Jefferson and more recently by Nancy Reagan for setting her
husband's schedule.
   So, it's only natural that it take on financial applications,
said Elizabeth Gauerke, who analyzes weather cycles to predict
events.
   ``In the history of the world, money and the planets have always
been tied up,'' she said. ``The market is not predictable, but what
planets do is. It's a simple formula that works for a lot of
people.''

   The stock market rolled up a broad gain Friday,
bolstered by expectations of help from the Federal Reserve toward
lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 35.89 to
2,490.84, finishing the week with a gain of 54.70 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,091 up, 466 down and 439 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 168.70 million
shares, up from 159.27 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 204.47 million shares.
   Analysts found no big surprises in two government reports Friday
morning that showed new signs of weakness in the economy.
   The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payroll employment
dropped 68,000 last month, although the civilian unemployment rate
held steady at 5.7 percent.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said its index of leading

   Such evidence of a recession continues to drag down corporate
earnings estimates in the financial world. But it has also stirred
talk that the Federal Reserve might soon step up its efforts to
ease credit conditions.
   In addition, the market had a drop in oil prices working in its
favor.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose | to 48{;
Texaco } to 60~; International Business Machines 1&lsqb; to 108&rsqb;;
General Electric | to 53, and American Express 1 to 19}.

   A sustained decline in interest rates would stand to relieve
pressure on many financial issues, brokers said, and also shore up
the real estate markets where most of these companies have a major
stake.
   Orion Pictures picked up 1{ to 11&lsqb; on takeover speculation.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<HEAD>Uncle Sam Stands Out in the Borrowing Crowd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the midst of hard times for many borrowers,
the biggest credit junkie of all comes to Wall Street this week to
ask for a record-sized loan.
   And there is little doubt he will get his money with a minimum
of fuss. Lenders, in fact, may be so eager to oblige him that they
will offer him a break on the interest rate.
   The party with the oustretched hand is the U.S. Treasury, which
plans to solicit $34.25 billion through the sale, over a three-day
span from Tuesday through Thursday, of notes and bonds.
   More often than not in recent years, these quarterly
``refundings'' by the government have been greeted with trepidation
by traders in the stock and bond markets.
   The nagging fear keeps recurring that one day they will hold a
Treasury auction and many of the usual bidders simply won't show
up.
   This time, however, such talk has been all but stilled. Instead,
some observers say, a developing credit crunch in many sectors of
the economy may actually have enhanced the market for paper floated
by Uncle Sam.
   As Jack Lavery, director of global research at Merrill Lynch put
it recently: ``Increased concern about credit quality has sparked
greater domestic demand for Treasury issues, even though foreign
demand appears to be drying up.''
   The Treasury has long ranked as one of the world's best credit
risks, supported by a vast store of national resources and assets,
and by its powers to tax and to print money. So what if its
checkbook has been chronically out of balance for the last 20
years?
   Demand at the refunding is also expected to be bolstered by
spreading weakness in the economy and expectations that the Federal
Reserve might soon take further steps to relax its credit policy.
   Both those forces traditionally work in the direction of lower
interest rates.
   So as the Treasury outlined its borrowing plans in the past
week, stock prices managed to gain ground. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrials rose 54.70 points to 2,490.84.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 3.36 to
170.07; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 2.09 to 336.45, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 1.41 at 289.98.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 154.29 million shares a day,
against 143.98 million the week before.
   Even if interest rates decline in the markets for Treasury debt,
analysts caution that it won't necessarily become easier and
cheapier for everybody to borrow money.
   Holding companies of some of the nation's biggest banks now have
to pay astronomical returns to attract and keep capital from
investors.
   The banks, in turn, have grown increasingly stringent in the
standards they apply to customers who seek loans.
   Elsewhere the story is much the same. In the market for
short-term, interest-bearing securities, for instance, money market
mutual funds, which sit on a $400 billion-plus pile of lendable
cash, are still reported to be narrowing the scope of the risks
they will take.
   ``As more and more of the investment world is driven into the
little corral of Treasury bills, quality spreads must inevitably
widen,'' says James Grant in his biweekly Grant's Interest Rate
Observer.
   In a summarizing comment, he adds: ``In the contraction phase of
the credit cycle, trouble begins at the fringe and worms its way
into the core.
   ``It begins with the thrifts and ends with the banks, some of
which were thought to be above it. It tests all financial
structures the way salt water finds every unpainted crevice aboard
a ship.''

   Ford Motor Co. said Friday up to 3,000

original estimate of 133.
   Earlier this week, Ford announced a recall of 55,000 cars to

Trainor said.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Slump, Led by Sharp Drop in Platinum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices fell sharply Friday, led by a drop
of more than $15 an ounce in the price of platinum amid heavy
Japanese selling.
   On other commodity markets, oil prices tumbled; livestock and
meat futures were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Platinum futures settled $15.10 to $15.90 lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with the spot price at $416.60 and the actively
traded contract for January delivery at $420.60 a troy ounce.
   Gold finished $5.10 to $5.50 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with December at $377.80 a troy ounce; silver was 7.1
cents to 7.8 cents lower with December at $4.185 a troy ounce.
   The sell-off wiped out most of the gains registered in the
precious metals complex earlier in the week.
   Analysts said lower Japanese stock prices and weak U.S. economic
data prompted heavy selling of platinum on perceptions that
industrial demand for the metal will decline as economic conditions
worsen.
   ``A good part of the selling was coming from the Japanese,''
said Don Tierney, metals analyst with Fortune Commodities Inc.
``Whenever their stock market falls off, they've got to sell some
of their platinum to lighten up on their holdings.''
   Some observers also cited Friday's sharp drop in oil prices,
which eased inflationary pressures.
   And several analysts said gold futures weakened due to Middle
Eastern sales of gold bullion and perceptions that more Middle
Eastern selling could occur over the weekend.
   ``This seems to be a pattern we've developed on Fridays: traders
get quite nervous and sell out because of fears of weekend sales
from the Middle East,'' said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading
adviser with the futures brokerage Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co.
   Tierney said buying by Swiss and U.S. investors lifted gold off
its lows. The November gold contract traded as low as $376.10 an
ounce during the session.
   Petroleum futures tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
reflecting a lack of bullish developments in the Persian Gulf
standoff.
   Instead of an escalation in the warlike rhetoric of recent days,
news reports from the Middle East mainly highlighted the
possibility that Iraq will free more foreign hostages.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 55 cens to $1.17 lower with
December at $34 a barrel; heating oil was 2.26 cents to 2.96 cents
lower with December at 87.42 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
2.65 cents to 3.09 cents lower with December at 89.21 cents a
gallon.
   Pork belly futures soared their permitted daily limit of 2 cents
a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, boosted by higher
prices for fresh bellies. Analysts said belly demand by bacon
makers remained strong.
   Cattle futures ended mixed in dull trading.
   Live cattle were .08 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December
at 77.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .18 cent
lower with November at 87.22 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent
lower to .53 cent higher with December at 52.75 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with
February at 64.45 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   A series of negative economic reports Friday
sent the dollar falling on speculation the Federal Reserve will
push interest rates lower.
   Gold dropped in active trading.
   Analysts said the dollar fell after two government reports on
the economy provided further evidence that the economy is
weakening.
   The Labor Department said the unemployment rate was unchanged
last month from September's 5.7 percent, but non-farm payrolls fell
by 70,000, indicating businesses have less demand for workers.
   The government also reported that its chief economic forecasting
gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, dropped 0.8
percent in September for its second straight monthly drop.
   Foreign exchange markets sold the dollar down following the
release of both reports, believing the data would put more pressure
on the Fed to nudge interest rates lower as a means of stimulating
the economy.
   Lower U.S. interest rates are bad news for the dollar, which
like all currencies is supported by higher rates.
   Jack Barbanel, a market analyst with First Global Asset
Management Inc., said the dollar was further hurt by Germany's
decision Thursday to raise a key interest rate, the Lombard rate.
The increase gave more support to the German mark.
   The dollar fell to 1.4945 marks in New York Friday from 1.5035
late Thursday. In earlier European trading, the dollar fell to
1.5020 German marks, from 1.5070.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 129.10 Japanese yen from
130.70 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 128.50
yen, and the dollar closed at 127.78 yen in New York, down from
130.555.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9515 from $1.9525 late
Thursday. But in New York, the pound rose $1.9590 from $1.9450.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late prices, included: 1.2605 Swiss francs, down from 1.2735;
5.0180 French francs, down from 5.0410; 1,123.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,127.25; ad 1.16475 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16425.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.2705 Swiss francs, down from 1.2745; 5.0420
French francs, down from 5.0525; 1.6938 Dutch guilders, down from
1.6980; 1,129.00 Italian lire, down from 1,129.75; and 1.1653
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1650.
   Gold fell in New York, closing at $376.40 a troy ounce, down
$5.10, on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $376.25 a troy ounce, down $5.15.
   Gold prices fell in London to a late bid of $376.25 a troy
ounce, down from $379.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to
$375.50 an ounce from $380.75 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 81 cents an ounce to $380.06.
   Silver dropped 7 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closed at
$4.160 a troy ounce. Silver fell earlier in London to a late bid of
$4.18 a troy ounce, down from $4.19 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Fuel Prices Widen Pan Am's Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. said Friday its third quarter
losses increased by 62 percent, reflecting sharply higher fuel
costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The ailing airline reported Friday that it lost $29.1 million,
or 19 cents per share, for the quarter, compared with a loss a year
earlier of $18 million, or 12 cents a share.
   Observers were not surprised to see the loss at Pan Am, which
recently announced the sale of prized London routes to UAL Corp. in
what is viewed as a bid to raise cash to buy time through the
sluggish winter travel season.
   ``It's not too hopeful, and that's supposed to be their best
quarter. I mean, that's when people travel overseas,'' said analyst
Raymond E. Neidl, with Dillon Read &amp; Co Inc.
   The skyrocketing costs of jet fuel ``killed any chance they had
of making any profit in the quarter,'' Neidl said.
   Pan Am's earnings statement said jet fuel costs averaged 77.2
cents a gallon in the quarter, compared with 60.3 cents a year
earlier. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 sent all fuel prices
soaring, and airlines complain that jet fuel rose even higher than
other fuels.
   Pan Am said that for the first nine months of the year, it lost
$268.8 million, compared with a $273.9 million loss for the same
period in 1989.
   The company's main subsidiary, Pan American World Airways,
reported a loss of $29.2 million for the third quarter, compared
with a loss of $29.1 million a year earlier.
   Pan Am said revenues increased by 13.1 percent, to $1.154
billion from $1.020 billion, for the highest total in company
history,
   Pan Am also pointed out that its scheduled passenger traffic was
up 6.7 percent, its load factor was up from 71.7 percent to 73.4
percent and revenue passenger yield rose 8 percent.
   ``Our improvement in these key areas is very encouraging, and
gives us renewed confidence that our marketing, scheduling and
service strategies are working,'' chairman and chief executive
Thomas G. Plaskett said.
   ``But the dramatically escalating price of fuel, as well as
expense increases in virtually all other areas, offset the positive
effect these improvements might have had on our financial
performances in the quarter.''
   The corporation's bottom line also was eroded by $40.5 million
in interest costs and a $9 million loss through foreign exchange
transactions.

<TEXT>
   America's unemployment rate held at 5.7
percent in October after rising for three straight months, but big
new job losses still cut across the U.S. economy, the government
said Friday.
   For the third month in a row, more industries lost jobs than
gained them, the Labor Department said in a report analysts took as
new evidence a recession is taking hold. Dramatic falloffs in
construction and manufacturing jobs pushed non-farm payrolls down
by 70,000, the agency said.
   The jobless rate held steady rather than rising again only
because the labor force, which had been growing slowly, shrank by
183,000 workers in October. Students' return to school probably
explained much of that drop, economists said.
   ``This is strong evidence that the economy really has lost its
footing now and slipped into recession,'' said Robert Dederick,
chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   The numbers ``point to a worsening employment picture ... the
employment situation continued to deteriorate in October,'' said
Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   ``It clearly shows a downturn ... I think you'd have to be
pretty starry eyed to think otherwise,'' said Peter Radford of
National Westminster Bancorp in New York.
   In other discouraging news Friday, the Commerce Department said
its Index of Leading Economic Indicators dropped 0.8 percent in
September for its second straight decline. Three consecutive drops
in that index are generally considered a sign that a recession is
imminent.
   Before October, the nation's unemployment rate had risen three
months in a row, increasing half a percentage point from June's 5.2
percent rate.
   Analysts have expected the nation's jobs outlook to continue to
darken, partly because of the turmoil in the Persian Gulf. The oil
price shock and the threat of war have left American businessmen
skittish about adding employees, analysts said.
   ``They buttoned up the overcoat, put on the scarf and the
galoshes, too. Businessmen really are preparing for the worst,''
Dederick said.
   In addition, analysts add that the economy had shown little sign
of life even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Many expect the jobless rate to continue climbing in coming
months, possibly up to as much as 6.5 percent by next summer. Just
in the past week, several major corporations announced large-scale
job layoffs, including General Motors' plan to idle 27,000 workers.
   The nation's 70,000-job loss in October followed a September
payroll decline of 52,000 jobs, the government said. A year ago,
the economy was producing nearly 200,000 new jobs a month.
   Construction lost 80,000 jobs last month to reflect a continued
deterioration in the housing market. Over the past five months,
that industry has seen jobs tumble by 185,000 and its unemployment
rate surge from 9.7 percent to 13.2 percent, the government said.
   In manufacturing, payrolls fell by 60,000 in October as that
sector continued on an 18-month downward spiral. Since reaching a
post recession peak in January 1989, the manufacturing sector has
lost 580,000 jobs, the government said.
   In another sign of weakness, the average work week for private
businesses fell to 34.2 hours from 34.7 in September. That
half-hour drop was the largest decline since the 1981-82 recession,
when the work week dropped six-tenths of an hour in January 1982,
from 35.0 hours to 34.4 hours.
   The average manufacturing work week was down, too, registering
at 40.8 hours in October, compared to the 41.1 hours in September.
   ``We got a double hit - we lost workers and in addition we lost
average hours worked. This is consistent with the forecast that
output is falling,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, who heads a St. Louis
economic forecasting firm.
   The service-producing sector added 74,000 jobs. But within the
sector, retail trade lost 48,000 jobs and wholesale trade lost
11,000 jobs. Job cutbacks in department stores have totaled about
80,000 since May 1989, the government said.
   Most of the service sector growth came from health services,
which continued to show robust job growth, adding 60,000 new jobs
last month.
   Labor costs were unchanged, as the average hourly worker made
$10.13 an hour in October, just as in September.
   Overall, total civilian employment was about 117.7 million in
October while the jobless numbered just over 7 million.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the October
jobless rate was 5.6 percent, unchanged from September.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell slightly in volatile trading
Friday as conflicting economic forces turned the market into a
buy-sell rollercoaster.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 5-32 point, or about
$1.56 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices
fall, advanced to 8.70 percent from 8.68 percent late Thursday.
   The small price change ``camouflages some fairly active trading
and large volatility today,''said Scott Winningham, market analyst
at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates.
   Bond traders said things got off to a turbulent start with a
flurry of speculative buying just before the Labor Department
released its monthly employment report early in the day.
   The department said the unemployment rate held steady at 5.7
percent in October, but it also reported that dramatic declines in
construction and manufacturing jobs pushed non-farm payrolls down
by 70,000.
   Analysts said the report - which signaled a further weakening of
the economy - met the market's expectations, and traders began to
sell off their holdings to cash in on the earlier gains.
   The government also said Friday that its gauge of future
economic health dropped 0.8 percent in September, the second
straight big decline and the third month without improvement.
   Bond prices usually rise on negative economic news. When the
economy is on a downturn, the Federal Reserve is considered more
likely to nudge interest rates lower.
   But prices were held down by investors worried about next week's
scheduled Treasury refunding auction. Traders were concerned that
the sale of $34.25 billion in bonds could create an oversupply of
government securities.
   Bonds did get some support from a decline in oil prices. Light,
sweet crude, the benchmark grade of U.S. oil fell $1.17 a barrel to
$34.00 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, alleviating some
concerns about inflation.
   Inflation is an anathema to the bond market because it erodes
the value of fixed-income securities and puts pressure on the Fed
to keep interest rates high.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities were unchanged to 3-32 point lower, intermediate
maturities fell 5-32 point to 3-16 point and long-term issues
ranged from 5-32 point lower to &lsqb; point higher, the Telerate Inc.
financial information service reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.44 to 1,160.86.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.30 percent as the
discount rose 3 basis points to 7.08 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 7.39 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to
7.04 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.33 percent as the
discount rose 3 basis points to 6.87 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 7~ percent, down from 7 15-16 late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 3-32 point to 89 19-32. The average
yield to maturity fell to 7.66 percent from 7.67 percent late
Thursday.

   The government's gauge of future economic
health dropped 0.8 percent in September, the second straight big
decline and the third month without improvement, the Commerce
Department said.
   Many analysts responded to the Friday report by saying a
national recession not only had arrived but was intensifying.
   The Bush administration contends the economy is growing and will
continue to do so at least into the new year, but the question for
many private analysts instead is how long and severe the
contraction will be.

   DETROIT (AP) - The shaky economy caused Chrysler Corp. and Fiat

   ``Uncertainties in the global economy, rising oil prices brought

Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said Friday.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Fast-food giant McDonald Corp.'s decision to
abandon foam packages won't put much of a dent in the plastics

material.
   The containers for Big Macs, Quarter Pounders and other
sandwiches served at McDonald's 8,000 restaurants nationwide
account for less than 1 percent of the $5 billion-plus market for
polystyrene, says the Society of the Plastics Industry, a
Washington trade group.

   PARIS (AP) - The bottlers of bubbly Perrier water reported that
net profits more than doubled in the first half of 1990 despite a

   The profit increase came mostly from the sale of the group's
soft-drink operations, Source Perrier SA said Friday.
   First-half volume sales of the popular mineral water were down
14 percent from 1989 and revenue slipped 3 percent due to the
recall and delays in restocking the beverage, Source Perrier said.

   Electronic Data Systems on Friday canceled a
multibillion-dollar deal with Continental Airlines for half the
airline's reservations system.
   The action is a blow to beleaguered Continental, which has been
trying to raise cash. The Houston-based carrier last week mulled a
bankruptcy declaration but instead decided to try to sell some
assets.
   The reservation system, called System One, is one of
Continental's most prized assets and would have yielded an
estimated $4 billion from the EDS deal over 10 years.
   Continental spokesman Art Kent said the collapse of the deal
would have no effect on the company's immediate situation. Money
from the transaction was to have been placed in escrow for
disbursement when the bankruptcy of Continental's sister carrier,
Eastern Airlines, was resolved, he said.
   EDS and Continental attributed the cancellation to the upheaval
in the airline industry caused by higher jet fuel prices. The
increase has cut into airline profits and forced carriers to raise
ticket prices.
   ``It's not a positive impact and was one of a number of factors
that, over time, led us to believe we should not go forward with
this transaction,'' said Roger Still, a spokesman for Dallas-based
EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors Corp.
   ``If you're going to enter into a fairly complicated deal,
anything that has a financial impact on one of the partners has an
impact on the entire deal,'' Still said.
   Continental president Hollis Harris said this week that the
company paid $70 million more in October for jet fuel than it did
in July, just before Iraq invaded Kuwait and triggered a sharp
increase in oil prices. The carrier uses 3.5 million gallons of jet
fuel a day.
   Continental, the most actively traded issue on the American
Stock Exchange, lost 50 cents on Friday to close at $2.62{ per
share.
   General Motors Class E stock, which represents its share in EDS,
slipped 12{ cents to close at $33.37{ per share on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Both companies said discussions would continue on other
marketing and management ventures involving System One.
   The agreement, first made in February and signed in September,
would have made EDS the first non-airline company to participate in
an airline reservations system.
   The deal created two partnerships. The first involved the
reservations system itself and the second involved technological
services System One provides to other airlines and travel-related
customers.
   Kent said Friday's action was a postponement ``of the full
breadth of the working relationship'' between the two companies.
``EDS has great knowledge and technology to bring to what System
One does,'' Kent said.
   Neither Still nor Kent had specific details on how the canceled
deal may be reformed.
   Airline analyst Bob Bernstein, of the Edward D. Jones &amp; Co.
investment firm in St. Louis, said the cancellation was a
disappointment for Continental.
   ``This was a way of gathering some cash to possibly tide them
over a weak airline traffic situation that appears to be coming
with the higher ticket prices,'' Bernstein said.
   Continental's financial problems may force the company to lay
off some workers, Harris said during a speech to Houston leaders
Wednesday.
   The carrier is already negotiating the sale of its Houston
airline food service operation, Chelsea Catering.
   It also may sell a lucrative Honolulu-Tokyo route to Air
Micronesia. The carrier has only had the route for six months. It
begins in Houston and is the only one from Texas' largest city to
Japan.

   State Street Bank and Trust Co. has agreed to sell

   The sale was expected to be completed in January 1991, said
David Spina, a spokesman for State Street. He said the anticipated
pre-tax gain from the sale was $60 million.
   ``We have agreed with the buyer that we are not going to reveal
its identity until after its board approves the sale,'' said Spina.
   Madden, in a written statement, said State Street was only
receiving a small profit from the portfolio and decided to unload
it to one of the large players.
   State Street has more than $800 billion in assets. It provides
securities processing and record-keeping services for mutual funds
and pension funds.
