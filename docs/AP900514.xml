   A congressional delegation will travel to
Korea later this month to accept the remains of five U.S. soldiers
killed in the Korean War, the lawmakers said Monday.
   The action by the communist government will mark the first time
North Korea has repatriated remains from the war since 1954.
   ``We hope this will be a breakthrough that we can work with the
North Koreans to get other remains back from that country as we
have done in Vietnam,'' Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss.,
told reporters.
   Montgomery, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee,
will lead the six-member delegation to Panmunjom, the village in
the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea where the
Military Armistice Commission meets.

   Only about a third of the daughters of poor
teen-age mothers in a 20-year study became teen-age mothers
themselves, indicating the cycle of teen childbearing is less
prevalent than thought, researchers said Monday.
   However, the new generation of teen-ager mothers appeared more
vulnerable to poverty than even their own young mothers were,
meaning the problem remains a serious factor in urban poverty, the
report said.
   ``There isn't a kind of inevitability of the cycle of poverty
being repeated from generation to generation,'' said Frank
Furstenberg Jr., a University of Pennsylvania sociologist. ``That's
an important finding.''
   But, he said in an interview, ``There are also some sobering
results that indicate that the minority who do go on to follow in
their mothers' footsteps could have less room for maneuvering their
way out of poverty.''
   The study consisted of interviews of 404 pregnant teen-agers in
Baltimore from 1966-1968, then follow-up interviews with the
mothers and their children one, three, five, 17 and 20 years later.
   Of the 118 female children who remained in the sample after 20
years, only 42 _ or 36 percent _ had become teen-age mothers
themselves, said the study, led by Furstenberg and published in the
journal ``Family Planning Perspectives.''
   That finding ``challenges the popular belief that the offspring
of teen-age mothers are themselves destined to become adolescent
parents,'' the report said. It defined teen mothers as those under
19.
   The 404 original mothers, mostly poor urban blacks, were not
selected randomly, meaning the results cannot be projected to a
broader population.
   However, when the researchers examined data gathered from
1979-1986 in the ongoing National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
which is based on a random sample, they reached the same finding:
Only about a third of the daughters of black teen-age mothers
became teen-age mothers themselves.
   The study apparently marked the first time the national survey
results were examined this way, Furstenberg said. He said his group
checked for the confirmatory data because it was startled by its
Baltimore finding.
   While the percentage of second-generation teen-age mothers was
lower than expected, it was much higher than the teen pregnancy
rate among daughters of adult mothers. Among urban blacks in that
group, surveys indicate that only about a fifth become teen
mothers, Furstenberg said.
   The current study did not focus on why the children of teen
mothers are more likely to become teen mothers. He speculated that
the rate is lower than expected because researchers have
underestimated the strength of urban black teen-agers' feelings
against having children.
   The most troubling finding, Furstenberg said, was that
second-generation teen mothers in the Baltimore survey were more
likely than their mothers to remain unmarried, collect welfare and
fail a grade in school.
   ``This trend could portend the growth of an urban underclass,
even though only a minority of the offspring of urban teen-age
mothers go on to become adolescent parents,'' the report said.
   It addition to Furstenberg, it was written by research assistant
Judith Levine of the University of Pennsylvania and senior research
scientist Jeanne Brooks-Gunn of the Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J.

   Dozens of folks from this mountain hamlet
jammed into a tiny church last week to find out why the Grundy
County Courthouse had burned down.
   When District Attorney General Bill Pope Jr. announced it was
arson, the crowd of men in baseball caps and women carrying babies
heaved a long, sad sigh.
   Their worst fears had been confirmed. The destruction of the
105-year-old courthouse added one more chapter to the county's
embarrassing history of arson.
   ``It's just another happening that puts Grundy County in the
news media, something bad happening,'' said Sheriff Aubrey Harper.
   A pair of brothers fresh from a brush with the law were charged
in the May 3 courthouse blaze.
   The case seems part of a history of suspicious fires and
explosions stretching nearly from the turn of the century in this
old mining county on the Cumberland Plateau northwest of
Chattanooga.
   An arson blaze on April 27, 1935, leveled 10 buildings in Tracy
City, causing more than $100,000 in damage and nearly wiping out
the business district.
   On Aug. 24, 1971, when the 100-year-old L&amp;N Depot in Tracy City
burned down, then-Sheriff Henry Morrison said it was the county's
22nd fire of the year. Most were blamed on arson.
   In May 1976, two men were charged with torching the town's James
K. Shook School, a massive 86-year-old building that boasted a
turret and a clock tower.
   Newspaper offices have been a favorite target. The Grundy County
Times office was set afire in September 1915, and the Grundy County
Herald was destroyed by arson in 1978, 11 years after an explosion
damaged that paper's old office.
   Sometimes revenge seems to be the motive. Other times it's just
plain vandalism.
   Law enforcement authorities hesitate to label Grundy County a
hotbed of suspicious fires.
   ``I'm not going to say that Grundy County is any different than
any other rural county,'' said Bill Thompson, special agent in
charge of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's eastern district.
``There are a ton of good people there.''
   Still, the rugged county of 14,500 people has a certain
notoriety.
   Beyond arson, vandals seem especially fond of dynamite, probably
because of the area's coalfield history.
   In 1965, '67 and '70, dynamite blasts destroyed or damaged water
tanks in various parts of the county. Also in 1967, about 800
people lost water service after somebody blew up the Tracy City
pumping station.
   A Tracy City lumber yard was dynamited in 1969, and the next
year a similar blast leveled a doctor's clinic there.
   Fires and bombings were so common at abandoned county schools in
the '70s that officials had a hard time getting insurance.
   Said then-Superintendent Glenn Bonner: ``Just as soon as a
building becomes vacant _ boom!''
   In recent years, the county has become notorious as a hub for
chop shops, places where stolen cars are stripped for parts that
are resold.
   Folks are still rankled by a 1988 newspaper story in which a
Davidson County police officer said, ``If you don't cut wood or
steal trucks in Grundy County, you're in bad shape.''
   The chop shops sprang up in the 1960s after the coal mines
closed, and they flourished despite major police raids in 1965,
1971 and 1979 that sent dozens of people to jail.
   Harper contends stepped-up enforcement has put the business in
decline. In 1987, he said, deputies recovered about 400 stolen
cars; last year, the number had shrunk to under 50.
   But Grundy County's rough-and-tumble image lingers.
   ``In many respects, I think it is unfair,'' said Harper. ``But
at the same time, I know that many things have happened here over
the years that are still in people's minds.''
   The brothers charged in the courthouse fire, Brian Ellege, 23,
and Steve Ellege, 21, had been released on bond on burglary charges
the day before the fire. They were arrested May 8 and charged with
arson and felony vandalism. The brothers deny setting the fire.
   Authorities allege the two burned the building either out of
revenge or in an effort to destroy their criminal records.
   As much as anything, say some observers, that kind of attitude
may explain why many buildings in Grundy County come to an
incendiary end.
   ``Is there an attempt by wronged persons to administer justice
more so in a rural county than in an urban county? Possibly, yes,''
said Thompson.
   Said Harper: ``I think (rural) people probably take matters into
their own hands a little faster.''

   A team of six people is toiling in a small suite
of offices, unlocking the secrets of three decades of governmental
paranoia.
   The quasi-librarians have begun what promises to be months of
scrutinizing the disorganized files of the Detroit Police
Department's Red Squad, a product of the McCarthy-era hunts for
suspected Communist sympathizers.
   The files containing about 1.5 million names were released after
the city and a group of plaintiffs settled a 16-year-old lawsuit.
The plaintiffs argued that they were subject to illegal police
surveillance between the mid-1940s and the mid-70s.
   The surveillance stopped in 1974, when Mayor Coleman A. Young
first took office and ordered it halted.
   The Red Squad Notification and Distribution Compliance Program
was set up as part of a settlement approved last week by Wayne
County Circuit Judge Lucile A. Watts.
   Since then, the program has received 300 to 500 requests for
applications to receive files contained in boxes and file cabinets
in the offices, said its director, Dorian Paster.
   ``The requests are coming relatively thickly,'' he said Monday.
``We are in the (file) room and getting acquainted.''
   The task may take months, Paster said. The files will not be
available to the general public, but people who were spied on may
receive copies of their dossiers. Before releasing any information,
Paster said, names of police officers, informants and any
unsubstantiated information from a third party will be deleted.
   The workers are plunging into a haphazard filing system of
reports, newspaper stories, photographs and other information
assembled by the Red Squad.
   The lack of organization of many of the files has raised
Paster's eyebrows.
   ``It was a very thorough operation,'' he said of the early days
of the squad. ``I have a suspicion that that broke down in later
years. It seems that some material was moved.''
   But Paster won't know if that's the case until the files are
sorted. ``It is, at best, a difficult task,'' he added.
   Some of the people helping Paster sift through the files were
themselves onetime targets of the squad.
   ``By having people like that involved, it would go toward
assuaging some of the fears of the people who are applying,'' he
said. ``The applications will not be seen by the police.''
   The primary focus of the squad was to gather information about
people suspected of having ties to the Communist Party. The number
of names in the squad poses a considerable problem.
   ``It's amazing how many small people are the subject (of a
file),'' he said.
   ``One of things I ran across in a couple of cases now is address
books or other books that were either lost or stolen. They started
a file on every name in that book.''
   Also hampering his team's work is the nature of the program
itself.
   ``Part of the problem is that I can't name any names or
organizations and bring that information to the public,'' Paster
said. ``Anybody who has the least suspicion that they may be
covered by this should make an application.''

<HEAD>Jury Declares Town Bell a Nuisance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   In a case of symbol vs. slumber, a
jury agreed with a couple that the hourly ringing of an 1,800-pound
town bell next to their house is a nuisance at night.
   A judge won't rule until Friday whether the bell should be
silenced from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., but Richard and Pamela Carnall,
newcomers to the pretty New England town of Hatfield, said they
were happy with Monday's verdict.
   ``We understood it was a tradition and we never tried to take it
away from them,'' Carnall said.
   The jury found that the bell was a nuisance at night and caused
Mrs. Carnall injury by depriving her of sleep. But the panel found
no evidence her husband was harmed by the ringing, and it awarded
no damages to the couple.
   After the verdict, the Carnalls asked Superior Court Judge John
F. Murphy to order the bell silenced at night.
   Hatfield Selectmen Chairman George Zgrodnick Jr. said he was
unsure what the town's next step would be. Town hall was ``not a
happy place'' after the verdict, he said. ``Everybody seems kind of
downhearted and disgusted.''
   The bell, regarded by old-timers as a comforting fixture, has
called the 320-year-old farming community to work and rest for
generations. Ninety-one years ago, the town clock was installed and
the bell began its hourly chiming.
   Zgrodnick and other long-time residents had testified to their
fond memories of the bell.
   ``How did the people of Hatfield, how did their values get so
twisted, so distorted that they can put this symbol, this empty
symbol ahead of people's feelings,'' the Carnalls' attorney, W.
Michael Ryan, said in closing arguments.
   ``This is a historic old New England village of which the clock
and bell tower are a very significant part,'' said William O'Neil,
Hatfield town counsel.
   The bell belongs to the town but is housed in the white-steepled
First Congregational Church, which many years ago doubled as the
town hall.
   In 1988, the Carnalls moved next door to the town clock, which
was broken. Six months later, the clock was fixed and the Carnalls
began to complain they were being awakened at all hours.
   The Carnalls had asked that the ringing be declared a nuisance
and that a jury award damages. Jurors deliberated for about two
hours.
   ``I am comfortable that having convinced a jury, we'll also
convince the judge,'' Ryan said.

<DATELINE>YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't long after the
first tourists appeared in the valley carved amid granite peaks
that conservationists mourned the impact of humans here.
   Frederick Law Olmsted, a member of the first Yosemite
Commission, wrote in 1865 of ``picturesque rocks stenciled over
with advertisements of patent medicines.'' Naturalist John Muir
complained the ``valley looked like a frowsy, backwoods pasture''
after a visit in 1889, the year before Yosemite became a national
park.
   Yosemite National Park turns 100 this year. So do its problems.
   In Muir's day, no more than a couple of thousand hardy folk each
year trekked through the wilderness to refresh themselves in the
mists of Yosemite Falls and marvel at the park's granite monolith,
El Capitan.
   Last year, 3.4 million people came through the valley, bringing
with them some of the very problems they were trying to escape in
the city. Park officials are struggling with the best way to deal
with the crowding, pollution, development and traffic that threaten
its natural beauty and serenity.
   ``Yosemite, for a number of reasons, really just ranks very
highly in people's level of care,'' said Allan Bedwell, National
Park Service spokesman. ``It goes back to Yosemite playing a major
role in this country as a symbol of wilderness or nature or
primeval heritage.
   ``I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that it's
accessible to people. Those cliffs, those waterfalls, represent
wilderness _ even though you have to view that wilderness in a
fairly urban setting.''
   Visitors can order anything from pizza to prime rib in
Yosemite's snack bars and restaurants, or buy T-shirts, tennis
balls and mugs in park gift shops, then get extra cash from an
automatic teller machine. A beauty shop and video rental cater to
park service and concession employees who live in the valley.
   Law enforcement officers booked 500 people into the jail last
year.
   It was anticipated a decade ago that Yosemite's 100th birthday
on Oct. 1, 1990, also would be a celebration of the ambitious 1980
general management plan that promised to balance convenience with
conservation.
   But 10 years proved too short a time to meet such grandiose
goals as eliminating cars from the valley and removing nonessential
businesses, offices and personnel to locations outside the park
boundaries.
   The park service has acknowledged the failure to fully implement
the plan and is cataloging nearly 4,500 letters of comment from
park enthusiasts as it decides how to plan realistically for
Yosemite's next 100 years.
   ``The plan was formulated at a time when there was a different
administration and different political climate,'' Park
Superintendent Michael Finley said.
   Its implementation was hindered, in part, by a lack of money
and, in some instances, by proposals that proved unrealistic,
Finley said.
   For example, a landscape architect has found there is not enough
suitable land to expand employee housing in the community of El
Portal outside the park, as the plan proposes, Finley said.
   The park service did succeed in eliminating 650 parking spaces
as planned, but a parking garage that was supposed to replace some
of the lost spaces never materialized.
   Pressure to remove facilities from the park has remained
constant from environmentalists, who complain many of the services
interfere with the mandate to preserve Yosemite.
   ``We want to make it accessible to people. But do you need to be
able to buy mugs and T-shirts and a badminton racquet in order to
enjoy Yosemite National Park?'' asked Patricia Schifferle, regional
director of the Wilderness Society.
   Superintendent Finley argues that visitors who soothe their
muscles in a swimming pool after hiking to the top of Yosemite
Falls or spend a night in a $180 room at the Ahwahnee Hotel also
gain an appreciation of the park.
   ``If you look at it one way, you could be shocked and say, `In
John Muir's holy temple there are swimming pools,''' Finley said.
``But if John Muir could keep 200,000 people from churning up the
Merced River, would he do it by putting in three swimming pools?''
   At the heart of the controversy over what services are
appropriate for a national park is the Yosemite Park and Curry Co.,
a subsidiary of MCA, which provides guest services in the park.
   Critics argue that Curry wields too much influence over the
park. Schifferle cites Curry's proposal to remove some existing
employee housing and replace it with dormitories near Yosemite
Lodge. Schifferle says the plan is contrary to the goal of removing
unnecessary employee housing from the valley.
   ``A lot of what's been said critical of the Curry Company is
flat erroneous. They've said we want to build more facilities here.
Not true,'' said Curry spokesman John Poimiroo. He defended the
dormitory plan, saying it would decrease traffic between El Portal,
where it was proposed employees would be moved, and the valley
floor.
   Critics also say the company profits from a 30-year contract
that requires it to pay the government only .75 percent of its
annual sales while not contributing to the goals of the general
management plan.
   The National Park Service revealed that in 1989 Curry paid
$635,000 to provide, without competition, most guest services.
   Poimiroo admits the fee is low. He points out, however, that
Curry's financial commitment to the park does not end with the
concessions fee.
   Curry also has invested $100 million in the park since 1973,
when MCA bought the concessionaire, in maintenance and capital
improvements, which included $8 million to repair and restore the
Ahwahnee Hotel, Poimiroo said.
   But claims that the money represents an investment in the park
are met with skepticism by environmentalists, who say Curry
ultimately makes money on that type of spending.
   ``Are they spending money on the park, or are they spending
money to do business in the park?'' Schifferle said. ``That's why I
find the $100 million is probably more PR hype than reality as far
as actual benefit to the park. It's probably benefiting Curry
Company enormously.''
   Attempts to renegotiate the concessions fee before the contract
expires in 1993 have failed, but many expect the new contract to
include clauses requiring Curry to invest some profits in specific
programs.
   Finley points out that even successfully raising the fee would
not necessarily mean more money for Yosemite itself. The
concessions fee is deposited in the U.S. Treasury where it is
re-appropriated by Congress, leaving the park service to compete
with other interests, Finley said.
   The lively debate on how to protect Yosemite's natural beauty
inevitably leads to the park service's conflicting missions:
preserving the park while making it accessible to the public.
   ``Yosemite always has been on the political hot seat because,
probably more than any other park, it mirrors that tension every
day of every year,'' said Jim Snyder, park historian. ``The issues
have become national because they symbolize what could happen to
the national parks.''

<HEAD>Conservatives Aim New Criticism at Liberal Justice Marshall</HEAD>

   Thurgood Marshall's place in history was
assured before he became a member of the Supreme Court in 1967. Now
his conservative critics, long distressed by Marshall's liberal
record, say it's time for the first black justice to step aside for
a more youthful, energetic successor.
   Marshall, a civil rights pioneer who as a lawyer helped changed
the nation, will be 82 in July. He shrugs off questions about
retirement with customary curmudgeonly humor.
   ``I have a lifetime appointment and I intend to serve it,'' he
has said numerous times. He once told The Washington Post, ``I
expect to die at 110, shot by a jealous husband.''
   For decades before President Johnson named him to the high
court, Marshall had traveled the nation as the recognized legal
champion of the poor and the powerless. Some say he ranks with the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as a leader in the battle for racial
equality.
   Over 23 years as legal director of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People and then as the federal
government's solicitor general, Marshall argued 32 cases before the
Supreme Court. He won 29.
   His biggest NAACP victory came in the 1954 ruling that declared
racially segregated public schools unconstitutional.
   ``He changed America,'' said Erwin Griswold, the onetime Harvard
University Law School dean and himself a former solicitor general.
   ``When I think of great American lawyers, I think of Thurgood
Marshall, Abe Lincoln and Daniel Webster,'' said Georgetown
University Law School Dean Thomas G. Krattenmaker.
   Experts agree Marshall's legal accomplishments before joining
the high court far surpass those of any fellow justice. It is his
stature as a justice that has been questioned of late by
conservative critics.
   They say he is losing interest in much of the court's day-to-day
work and delegates too much responsibility to his young law clerks.
   Former clerks deny it. Marshall declined to be interviewed for
this article.
   One of the harshest attacks on Marshall was penned by Terry
Eastland, onetime aide to former Attorney General Edwin K. Meese
III. Eastland last year wrote in the conservative National Review,
``One joke has it that if Marshall retired, at least he wouldn't be
paid for watching television.''
   The reference apparently was prompted by earlier reports that
Marshall is a fan of ``The People's Court'' and watches the TV show
in his court office. The justice has denied the reports, saying,
``That's an awful program.''
   Criticism of Marshall's supposed work habits are often
accompanied by questions of his health.
   Standing 6 feet 2 and overweight, Marshall shuns exercise. He
had a heart attack in 1976, has suffered from bouts of pneumonia
and bronchitis. He was hospitalized in 1987 with a potentially
dangerous blood clot in his right foot.
   Marshall walks slowly and with apparent difficulty. Family
members reportedly convinced him a few years ago to stop driving;
he now gets to work in a chauffeur-driven limousine.
   Former clerks, however, insist his health is not deteriorating.
   Georgetown law professor Mark Tushnet, a Marshall clerk in 1972,
said, ``He did not look in good health then. He doesn't look any
different now.''
   Tushnet, who is writing a biography of Marshall, also dismissed
the idea that the increasing dominance of the court's conservatives
has soured Marshall.
   ``He seemed grumpy when I worked with him and he seems grumpy
now,'' Tushnet said.
   Legal scholars say a succession of conservative court
appointments has denied the old civil rights fighter the chance
that was briefly his to shape the law. Within two years of
Marshall's appointment to a predominantly liberal court, Chief
Justice Warren Burger replaced Earl Warren and the court's
evolution toward conservatism had begun.
   ``But Marshall has been very important in providing visions of
where the law should go,'' said Krattenmaker. ``He has written
several (dissenting) opinions that may prove to be persuasive.''
   Marshall and Justice William J. Brennan are the court's most
consistent liberals and most frequent dissenters.
   They stand alone in opposing capital punishment in all
circumstances, press for broader protection for criminal defendants
and lead the way in supporting affirmative action for minorities
and women.
   Marshall's former law clerks call him the court's conscience and
say his role is one of making sure the other justices realize their
decisions are affecting real, flesh-and-blood people.
   Marshall suffers from glaucoma. At times, it seems he has
trouble reading summaries of his opinions from the bench. At a
celebration of his 80th birthday, he insisted that television
camera lights be turned off because the glare bothered his eyes.
   Rumors of declining alertness were fed by an incident last fall
during an oral argument session before the court.
   Marshall posed several questions to a lawyer he seemingly
believed was representing the government when, in fact, the lawyer
was representing the other side.
   ``If I appear confused, I am,'' Marshall said at one point. When
another justice noted whom the lawyer represented, Marshall
recovered by telling the lawyer, ``Well ... there is no bar to you
giving me some help.''
   Marshall's public appearances away from the bench are rare. But,
when he does appear, he doesn't mince words.
   In televised interviews in 1987, he said President Reagan's
civil rights record ``ranks at the bottom,'' and accused Meese's
Justice Department of trying ``to undermine the Supreme Court
itself.''
   In a speech to a conference of lawyers and judges that year, he
said he was not about to quit fighting right-wingers.
   ``Don't worry, I'm going to outlive those bastards,'' he said.

   For more than a decade Doppler radar has been
the weather technology of the future. At the National Weather
Service the future, finally, is now.
   The first Next Generation Weather Radar _ NEXRAD _ is being
installed in Oklahoma City.
   A second will go to Melbourne, Fla., in late summer and the
third near Washington after the first of next year.
   NEXRAD will bring substantial improvement to the forecasting of
severe storms and floods, predicted Commerce Secretary Robert A.
Mosbacher.
   That already has begun, says National Weather Service Director
Elbert W. Friday Jr.
   During a 5{-month test in Oklahoma, NEXRAD was used in preparing
warnings for 450 severe weather events, Friday said.
   ``It was a beautiful season to test a system, but it was a
terrible season for the residents of Oklahoma,'' he said in a
recent interview. ``This was one of the most active seasons they
had had in a long time.''
   During that period, weather offices accurately warned of storms
about 59 percent of the time. The NEXRAD results were 91 percent,
Friday said. And the false alarm rate was cut from about 60 percent
to 21 percent at the Doppler radar site.
   Friday, pointing to the hazy sky outside his 18th floor office
in Silver Spring, Md., said current radars would see nothing there.
But NEXRAD, he said, would see air movement in that sky, telling
forecasters wind speed and direction to help make predictions.
   Radars send out a short radio pulse and listen for it to bounce
back. The time it takes tells the distance from whatever the signal
bounced off. The direction can be seen from where the radar faces.
   The current WSR-57 and WSR-74 radars, some 30 years old, can
detect things like rain, airplanes and buildings.
   NEXRAD can also see the invisible moisture and dust in
apparently clear air. And it can sense movement, telling which way
the wind is blowing at different levels by measuring the change in
frequency of the signal bouncing back.
   Just as an ambulance siren has a higher pitch coming toward you
than one going away, radar waves change depending on the movement
and speed of the object reflecting them back.
   Being able to see where the direction of the wind changes
abruptly can help a forecaster determine where a storm is likely to
develop and can tell a pilot where his plane may encounter
dangerous turbulence.
   This allowed meteorologists to give an hour and a half warning
of a tornado developing in the Denver area last year, Friday said.
   ``By seeing those fine-scale details in the atmosphere you can
identify ... factors that will be triggering the development of the
storm,'' instead of waiting to spot the twister, Friday explained.
   In combination with satellites and other new systems, NEXRAD
``is going to generate much more of a detailed look at the
atmosphere than we've ever had before,'' he said.
   This should help meteorologists understand ``what drives all of
the very small-scale features that really do cause most of the
problems for ... the flash floods and the heavy snows and the
tornadoes and the thunderstorms.''
   The radars and associated computerized work stations are being
built by the Unisys Corp.
   In addition to the National Weather Service, the price tag of
more than $400 million for the 175 radars is being shared by the
departments of Defense and Transportation.
   An Air Force test analysis of the NEXRAD found some serious
shortcomings, Friday acknowledged. But that was the idea, he said.
   Maintenance problems, with the machinery not operating for long
periods, were the biggest troubles, according to the Air Force.
Some operators rated the radars not acceptable.
   Many involved construction problems, and those have been taken
care of, Friday said.
   Another problem cited by the Air Force technicians was ``range
folding,'' which also occurs with current radars.
   Sometimes the bounce-back signal received by a radar is not from
the most recent pulse, but an earlier one coming back from a more
distant object.
   The computer can't tell the difference, assuming all signals are
from the most recent pulse. That results in a distant storm showing
up on radar as nearby.
   Computers now have been programmed to show purple on the screen
when two signals come back from the same spot, an indication to the
meteorologist that range folding is occurring. The radar operator
then can change the frequency of the signals to separate them on
the screen.
   Installation of the new radars is part of an overall
reorganization of the National Weather Service. The agency will go
from about 300 weather offices to 115.

Potential Crisis</HEAD>

   A four-year drought and a mysterious fungus
are killing the chaparral, the dense brush that blankets the hills
of southern California, leaving it tinder-dry with a potential for
fires with ``the energy of Hiroshima.''
   Officials fear this summer could be the worst wildfire season in
decades.
   Fire season was declared weeks early in Santa Barbara and San
Luis Obispo counties, and will be declared Monday for the rest of
southern California, said Doug Allen of the California Department
of Forestry. Rainfall in the region so far this year measures about
38 percent of normal, which is about 15.5 inches.
   ``It is as bad as I have seen in my 33 years in the fire
service,'' said Los Angeles Deputy Fire Chief Donald F. Anthony. He
has ordered firefighters to stockpile plastic pipe so they can pump
water from home swimming pools.
   Especially alarming is a fungus that preys on drought-weakened
brush, killing as much as 60 percent of it in parts of the suburban
Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains, said Philip J. Riggan, a
U.S. Forest Service scientist.
   Mountain lilac, manzanita, sumac, California holly and even oak
trees all have been afflicted, leaving gray blotches of dead wood
on mountains and canyons.
   A pound of chaparral has about the same energy as a cup of
gasoline, said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Scott Franklin. In
areas of dense growth, fire officials estimate the chaparral at
more than 60 tons per acre, he said.
   ``We're talking about the energy of Hiroshima,'' he added.
   The fungus, botryosphaeria ribis, appears to act like an
opportunistic disease on already-stressed brush. At some
elevations, the dead bushes look like ``a bathtub ring around the
Los Angeles basin,'' suggesting a link to air pollution, which is
held to certain altitudes by warm desert air over cooler marine
air, Riggan said.
   ``If people saw this kind of mortality in forests, they'd be
quite upset,'' Riggan added. ``The area is just ripe for a huge
fire.''
   But then, the forests are dying, too. Drought-stressed trees are
plagued by bark beetles, with most of the pines dead in some
stands, Riggan said.
   A worst-case scenario that Anthony and other fire officials
often use is the 1961 Bel-Air wildfire, which destroyed 484 homes
and injured 185 firefighters.
   Damage was estimated at $30 million, but Anthony noted: ``Most
of those homes were valued between $35,000 and $70,000 at that
time. I seriously doubt that there are many homes there now valued
at less than $850,000. That same fire today could certainly run
into the billions of dollars.''
   Conditions this year are worse, fire officials said, and many
residential developments in southern California have tempted fate
by pushing deep into scenic canyons and brushy hills.
   Every spring, homeowners are ordered to clear the brush
surrounding their home for at least 100 feet, but that won't help
much in the face of a major fire, officials said.
   On a recent trip through the San Gabriel Mountains above La
Canada Flintridge, Franklin looked down from a fire road to
multimillion-dollar homes snuggled amid the dense foliage of Winery
Canyon.
   ``That's the threat, right there,'' he said. ``We've got whole
communities that are at risk. We've got to start educating people
that we've got a serious problem.''
   ``It's just something that people are not very interested in,''
said Joan Feehan, a La Canada Flintridge City Council member who
has a $1.5 million mountain home nestled at the city's border with
the Angeles National Forest.
   ``Of course, you're aware of it when you pay your fire
insurance,'' Feehan said. The premium for her 5,000-square-foot
home is $3,200 a year.
   Controlled burning of chaparral is the only solution, Riggan and
Franklin said, but most prescribed burning programs have been
curtailed by state and federal budget cuts.
   ``If we're ever going to slow down these major fires, we've got
to go in and remove the fuel,'' Riggan said. ``If we don't do this
(prescribed burning), it's going to be business as usual, with one
catastrophic fire after another.''

<HEAD>Call Out For U.S. Regulation of Its Burgeoning Antarctica Tour
Industry</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

   U.S. tour operators are planning to send a
record 4,000 or more travelers to Antarctica, prompting calls for
strict government regulation to protect penguins, other wildlife
and the very fate of the frozen continent.
   ``The number of tourists visiting Antarctica has more than
tripled in the past five years,'' said Bruce Manheim, a Washington
activist of the Environmental Defense Fund who calls existing
controls inadequate.
   Antarctica has become a ``hot'' travel destination for the
1990s, beckoning older Americans seeking more adventure than Europe
and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a
privileged few in their youth.
   They are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry,
an estimated $1.3 billion-a-year phenomenon.
   About 800 American tourists traveled to Antarctica in 1988,
3,000 in 1989, and tour operators expect at least 4,000 in the
December-February summer season. Manheim says it could reach 5,000.
   ``There's clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary
visits to remote places in the world,'' said Manheim.
   He filed an appeal Tuesday with the government urging more
regulation.
   ``We are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to
Antarctica, we just think tourism is something that has to be
regulated carefully,'' he said.
   Concern began mounting after the January 1989 grounding of the
Argentine naval ship Bahia Paraiso in which an estimated 175,000
gallons leaked into marine habitats, killing seals, penguins and
other marine life. The vessel remains at the site off Palmer
Station with some oil in its tanks.
   Particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of Ocean Cruise
Lines of Fort Lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years
to Antarctica, the 460-passenger Ocean Princess.
   Rates begin at $3,895 per person for a double-occupancy cabin on
its three wine-and-caviar cruises, which are selling briskly. The
first round trip from Buenos Aires, Argentina, begins Dec. 22.
   Manheim's appeal is urging the government to place strict
controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites, guidelines on
tourist observation of penguins and seals, and coordination of
cruise ship visits to breeding grounds.
   He said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same
wildlife sites, disrupting the breeding of seals, penguins and
other birds.
   ``A year after Antarctica's most significant environmental
disaster, we still don't have regulations to prevent similar
catastrophes,'' said Manheim.
   The U.S. government responds that effective regulations are
already in place.
   ``We have tried, and we believed we have dealt succesfully with
the explosion of Antarctica tourism,'' said Jack Talmadge of the
National Science Foundation, which regulates U.S. activities in
Antarctica.
   Talmadge said the NSF has issued tourist regulations,
established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and
taken steps to limit visits to U.S. research stations.
   He said the tour operators are also cooperating with the NSF to
minimize the impact of tourism, including giving advance notice of
ship visits.
   Although 16 nations fly flags in Antactica and seven claim
slices of it, no nation holds title to the continent, which is
larger than the United States and Mexico combined.
   Military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists
have been frequent modes of travel to Antarctica since the first
tourists visited in 1958.
   Now, the Chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its
Teniente Marsh Station on King George island, and LanChile airlines
began commercial flights to that Antarctic stop last year.
   Australian entrepreneurs have proposed a five-story hotel,
airstrip and hovercraft dock. The Canada-based Adventure Network
currently flies tourists to one South Pole station.
   But the bulk of the tourists are Americans brought in by
U.S.-based operators. Conservationists say the United States should
therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy.
   ``Antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the United
States, and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our
tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international
level,'' said Manheim.
   Operators of the Ocean Cruise Lines said there is no cause for
alarm.
   ``The tourist visiting Antarctica is a determined
environmentalist, an avid lover of wildlife, and I can assure you
that no tourist _ not one _ has hurt or killed a bird or animal,''
said Lars Eric Lindblad, an Antarctic travel pioneer who will
lecture aboard the Ocean Princess.
   James Barnes, with Friends of the Earth in Washington, concludes
that the travelers may leave their footprints, but they often
return home more committed environmentalists _ ``Ambassadors of
Antarctica.''
   Nonetheless, he said, ``The scale of these activities is growing
at such a pace that it does provide cause for concern.''

<HEAD>Government's Economic Plan Shows Signs of Trouble</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of renewed inflation and
financial speculation have created fears in Brazil that a drastic
economic austerity plan launched in mid-March is running into
trouble.
   ``The full economic picture is not clear but one thing is:
Things are getting worse,'' said Alexandre Barros, a political
consultant.
   Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello met all weekend with key
advisers, and rumors abounded that new austerity measures would
soon be announced, including tightening credit and increasing
interest rates to hold down the money supply.
   ``The government will have to take immediate action now, or the
situation could spin out of control,'' said economist Jose Marcio
Camargo of Rio's Pontifical Catholic University. ``We may soon be
facing a recession with inflation _ the worst of both worlds.''
   The main concern is inflation, which seemed under control after
President Fernando Collor de Mello imposed his austerity plan on
March 16, a day after he took office.
   The measures, which included an 18-month freeze on $115 billion
in savings accounts and money market deposits, drastically reduced
record annual inflation of almost 5,000 percent.
   The plan also led to a dramatic economic downturn, with unions
estimating 300,000 people fired and businesses reporting
drastically reduced sales. The government has said the slowdown is
needed to put the economy in order.
   But after predicting just 10 days ago that inflation was ``dead
and beaten,'' Cardoso de Mello said on Friday the cost of living
rose more than 3 percent in April.
   Several private institutions say the government is seriously
underestimating inflation, and that the real rate for April was
between 10 percent and 20 percent.
   ``Whatever the true figure, the cost of living is creeping back
up again,'' said Camargo.
   Also troubling observers was the return of financial
speculation, which forced the government to sell gold last week to
keep down the price of the metal.
   And the dollar has already recovered its early March value of 80
cruzeiros. The currency on the illegal but widely tolerated black
market had fallen by more than 50 percent after Collor announced
the austerity plan.
   Last week, federal police raided the offices of black market
operators in Sao Paulo to try to slow the dollar's rise.
   ``Those sorts of actions are effective for only a few days. The
government will have to find better ways to end speculation,'' said
David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University of
Brasilia.
   The new round of speculation seemed tied in part to the public's
diminished faith in the economic program.
   A survey released last week by the Brazilian Association of
Credit and Savings Companies said $4 million has been pulled from
savings deposits. That would represent 36 percent of all money in
accounts not blocked by the freeze.
   Another sign of the public's lack of confidence is a recent boom
in sales of residential safes. Brazil's biggest safe manufacturer,
the Bernardini company, said home safe sales were almost double
levels prior to March.
   ``We've always had a credible financial sector. But people are
skeptical now and would rather spend or buy dollars,'' Camargo said.
   A final problem is that many companies skirted the bank freeze.
   The prominent Rio daily O Globo reported last week that firms
had managed to ``unfreeze'' almost $50 billion, mostly by paying
off debts and taxes as rules allowed.
   Jean Daniel Peter, the president of the Brazilian subsidiary of
Union Carbide, told the paper the company used all of its $18
million caught in the bank freeze.
   Others resorted to illegal methods. Blocked funds could be
donated to charities, and some companies made deals whereby they
made large contributions but received part of the money back.
   The money injected into the economy by such methods is believed
in part responsible for the rise in inflation.

<HEAD>Gorbachev's Sanctions on Lithuania Not Stopping Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev imposed tough sanctions on
Lithuania in hopes of frightening other republics away from
pressing for independence, but merely made them more cautious.
   An embargo on shipments of fuel, manufactured goods and raw
materials to Lithuania prompted the other two Baltic states, Latvia
and Estonia, to rephrase their demands for independence.
   They declared their firm intention to leave the Soviet Union,
but provided for transition periods of unspecified length. On
Saturday, the three republics announced they had forged a united
front to negotiate with the Kremlin.
   In other republics, activists are following in the early steps
of the Baltic republics on many issues, from opposing the military
draft to rejecting the orders of Moscow ministries on the economy.
   ``I think in half a year we'll see that, not only the Baltic
republics but some other republics _ first of all the Caucasus
republics _ will say they want real independence,'' said
sociologist Peteris Lakis, a leader of the Latvian People's Front
political movement.
   On May 6, representatives of people's fronts from eight
republics and several reform movements from Russia met in Kiev to
organize a Union of Democratic Forces ``to help republics quit the
U.S.S.R. ... and to ensure the empire disbands peacefully,'' said a
statement from the Ukrainian people's front, called Rukh.
   Gorbachev has said he believes splitting up the Soviet Union
would bring more violence than China's Cultural Revolution of
1966-76. He has pledged to prevent that, but indicated he wants to
avoid using force.
   In Sverdlovsk two weeks ago, he told citizens: ``Some say, let
this `empire' fall apart, while others say ... we need to restore
order with an iron fist. Neither has any connection to serious
policy.''
   Regions across the less-than-unified Soviet Union are rejecting
Kremlin authority.
   _Georgia's Parliament has demanded negotiations on independence.
Pro-independence parties are campaigning for seats in the
republic's Parliament in hopes of duplicating the Baltic activists'
two-thirds majorities.
   _Neighboring Azerbaijan exploded into virtual armed revolt in
January and remains under military control.
   _The Armenian Parliament has defied the Kremlin and ordered
local draftees to remain in Armenia to work on rebuilding areas
wrecked by the 1988 earthquake.
   _A pro-independence political party has formed in the Ukrainian
agricultural and industrial heartland, where nationalism is most
feared by Moscow. Activists in Lvov won control of the city council
in a recent election and raised the yellow and sky-blue Ukrainian
national flag over city hall.
   _In Moldavia, Mircha Snegur won the presidency from Communist
Party chief Pyotr Luchinsky with the backing of those who favor
greater autonomy or independence. He opposes Gorbachev's blockade
of Lithuania.
   _On the opposite end of the country, Sakhalin Island is planning
economic reforms, including selling land to farmers, according to
Moscow News.
   _Even the Russian republic's legislature will consider a
sovereignty resolution at the session beginning May 16. The extent
of support for it is not clear, but the Baltic republics started
their moves toward independence with constitutional amendments
claiming sovereignty and the right to reject national laws in their
territory.
   Gorbachev has not indicated willingness to abandon his demand
that Lithuania withdraw its March 11 declaration of independence
before any negotiations begin.
   He is calling for a new Soviet federation in which all republics
would have greater autonomy. New legislation provides a mechanism
for republics to secede, but only after a long waiting period.
   In several difficult periods of his five years in power,
Gorbachev has taken unexpected steps that not only solved the
immediate problem but carried him well beyond it.
   Until December, he rejected the idea of multiparty politics. He
suddenly threw his support behind the idea in January and by
mid-February had pushed the reform through.
   Baltic leaders and Western experts on Soviet nationalities say a
new leap by Gorbachev could ease the mounting pressure on Moscow
from the republics.
   Last month, he was said to have offered Estonia and Latvia
``special status'' in a ``confederative'' Soviet Union if they
would drop their demands for independence. Exactly what he meant is
not clear.
   Lakis, the Latvian activist, predicted Gorbachev would be forced
to negotiate and accept transformation of the country into a
confederation of independent nations.
   Asked whether that meant the end of the Soviet Union, he
replied: ``I think that's a necessity of history.''

<TEXT>
   Snowy peaks of the Pir Panjal look
down on dusty bazaars and winding alleys where young Moslems speak
of a holy war for Kashmir.
   Voices muffled by brightly colored bandannas that cover their
faces, they pledge themselves to a freedom-or-death struggle
against a mighty Indian army in what they call their homeland.
   Their goal is independence for Jammu-Kashmir, the only
predominantly Moslem state in the overwhelmingly Hindu nation of
India.
   Leaders of the movement plan a government-in-exile as refugees
fleeing across the mountains pitch tents on the Pakistan side of
the border, the focus of periodic skirmishes and two wars.
   The plotters of Kashmir's jihad, or holy war, are short on
weapons, money and guerrilla training, so they turn for help to
their Moslem brethren on another battlefield, Afghanistan.
   ``There is no difference between the Afghan jihad and the
Kashmir jihad,'' said Sheik Rashid, a right-wing opposition leader
who has asked religious leaders in Islam's holiest cities to
declare jihad in Kashmir.
   Such a declaration would oblige all Moslems to support a holy
war.
   Both India and Pakistan have claimed the former princely state
of Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947. They fought
wars over the region in 1948 and 1965, and fears of another have
arisen.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming, training and harboring
separatists in dozens of guerrilla camps along the border. Pakistan
denies it and accuses India of using violent tactics against
self-determination.
   Pakistani officials and militant leaders estimate up to 8,000
people have slipped across the border to what Pakistan calls Azad
(Free) Kashmir since India cracked down on the Jammu-Kashmir
separatist movement in January.
   The militants said they were inspired by Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's emotional pledge, ``Your blood is our blood,'' and had
expected to receive weapons, money and training in guerrilla
warfare in Pakistan.
   All they got, the men said, was food, shelter and the right to
speak their minds.
   ``The cause we are fighting for is self-determination,'' said
Ghulam Mohammad Safi. ``Our cause is a just cause, a holy war, but
Pakistan is doing nothing.''
   Safi leads Hezb-ul-Mujahedeen, or Party of Islamic Holy
Warriors, the most militarily organized of six Kashmiri groups
based in Muzaffarabad, capital of Azad Kashmir.
   ``Pakistan supported the Afghan resistance; we expect something
more,'' said Safi, a 40-year-old former schoolteacher who left
Jammu-Kashmir in March. ``The Pakistan army didn't intervene in
Afghanistan. We expect Pakistan to wage war against India.''
   Ms. Bhutto's government says it does not want another war with
India and has called for negotiations. The leader of the
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, leader of the independence
movement, said any agreement reached without the consent of the
Kashmiris would be doomed.
   ``We have our own agenda,'' said Raja Muzaffar Khan. ``We are
determined to win our freedom any way possible, by any means
possible.''
   He showed invoices for the purchase of $70,000 worth of weapons
and ammunition from tribal areas on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
   Included was $1,675 paid a smuggler to carry eight French-made
machine guns to Srinagar, the Jammu-Kashmir summer capital and
center of the separatist movement.
   Muzaffar Khan said the weapons were bought with money from
Kashmiris living in the United States and Europe, and from Arab
countries.
   ``We'll buy more as the need arises,'' he said.
   The militants have not been able to establish training camps,
but Muzaffar Khan said men were being taken into the dense mountain
forests for instruction in small arms.
   ``There are a lot of places where we can operate without the
knowledge of either government,'' he said. Muzaffar Khan said his
group was distributing instruction pamphlets on how to fire weapons
and had made a demonstration videotape.
   Nearly 1,500 men have gone to Afghanistan for combat training
with guerrillas who have spent 12 years trying to overthrow the
Soviet-backed government in Kabul, militant leaders said.
   Abdul Qayyum, president of Azad Kashmir, said the leaders of
Afghan guerrilla groups had offered help but the offers were
declined.
   Young men who wait in makeshift camps, however, are looking for
support from Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the fundamentalist Afghan
guerrilla leader.
   Despite his fervent anti-West rhetoric, Hekmatyar has received
most of the U.S. and Saudi weapons channeled to the guerrillas.
   He said he had been in contact with all Kashmiri groups, but
would not be specific.
   Many Pakistanis fear Muzaffarabad will become like Peshawar, the
wild frontier town that serves as the staging area for Afghan
guerrillas.
   Slogans demanding ``Give us freedom or we will take it'' are
painted on nearly every wall, and posters of slain militant leaders
are plastered on buildings throughout the provincial capital.
   Qayyum said his government planned to shut down the
Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front, which he called a ``nuisance''
engaged in terrorist acts, but said that would be difficult because
the government had only half the security forces it needed.
   Leaders of the militants are trying to draft a constitution,
form a common strategy and set up military, planning and recruiting
committees, but appear as divided as the Afgha resistance.
   ``It's one thing to sit in air conditioned offices and make
lofty plans,'' Qayyum said. ``They have no responsibility, no code
for the lives of other people.''
   ``You can teach an Afghan how to handle a gun in an hour,'' he
said. ``Afghans are born militants. It's their nature, it's in
their blood. Kashmiris have been pacificists over the centuries. We
don't know how to fight.''

<HEAD>Knights of Columbus to Give Bishops $3 Million to Oppose Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Knights of Columbus has pledged $3 million
to help underwrite an anti-abortion campaign by the nation's Roman
Catholic bishops.
   The 1.5 million-member Roman Catholic fraternal group announced
its backing of the public relations campaign on Sunday.
   ``This effort is needed to set out the facts about abortion as a
violation of human rights and counter the barrage of `pro-choice'
propaganda being generated by supporters of legalized abortion,''
said Supreme Knight Virgil C. Dechant.
   The bishops decided months ago to hire the public relations firm
Hill &amp; Knowlton and the Wirthlin Group, a polling concern, for help
in presenting their stand against abortion. The program is
estimated to cost $5 million.
   The bishops had said the program would be funded by outside
sources. The Knights were the first group to announce they would
cover part of the cost.
   The gift will allow the program to ``begin in earnest,'' said
Archbishop Daniel C. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   The campaign will start with a public opinion poll, then proceed
with a public information effort, said John Berard, a Hill &amp;
Knowlton spokesman.
   At their annual meeting in November, the first since a Supreme
Court ruling in a Missouri case gave states greater leeway to
restrict abortion, the bishops declared abortion was ``the
fundamental human rights issue'' of the day.
   The public relations program was unanimously approved in March
by the 50-member Administrative Committee of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.

<HEAD>With PM-Philippines, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Here is a summary of attacks on
Americans during a 21-year-old Marxist insurgency:
   April 13, 1974: Three Navy officers from a construction regiment
were ambushed and killed by Communist guerrillas near the Subic Bay
naval base, 50 miles west of Manila. The victims were inspecting a
new highway project when ambushed by about 16 New People's Army
rebels.
   Oct. 28, 1987: Two airmen, one retired Air Force sergeant and a
Filipino civilian of U.S. descent were slain in a series of near
simultaneous attacks near Clark Air Base. U.S. officials believe
they were killed in reprisal for American military ambulances
having evacuated Filipino troops wounded in a clash with the rebels
near Clark. The rebels claimed responsibility.
   April 21, 1989: Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe was ambushed and
killed as he rode to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance
Group in suburban Quezon City. The following day, the commander of
the New People's Army, Romulo Kintanar, claimed responsibility in
retaliation for U.S. ``arrogant trampling'' upon Philippine
independence.
   Sept. 26, 1989: Two American civilians employed by the Air Force
at Camp O'Donnell, 10 miles north of Clark, were ambushed on the
day Vice President Dan Quayle arrived in Manila for an official
visit. Rebels fired M-16 rifles from a commandeered dump truck and
a jeep. Although there was never a claim of responsibility, U.S.
officials believe the rebels were responsible.
   Feb. 21, 1990: American civilian geologist John Robert Mitchell,
42, of Fairbanks, Alaska, was ambushed and slain along with his
Filipino wife and father-in-law on Bohol island. Rebels later said
they were trying to kill the father-in-law because he refused to
pay ``revolutionary taxes'' and that Mitchell was caught in the
cross-fire.
   March 6, 1990: Stewart Frank Raab, 76, a longtime Philippine
resident, was killed by rebels on Masbate island after he refused
to pay ``revolutionary taxes.'' Police identified two longtime
rebel commanders as his killers, but no arrests have been made.
   May 4, 1990: Marine Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette, 34, was slain by
several assailants near Subic. No claim of responsibility was made,
but U.S. officials believe rebels were responsible. Two Filipino
drug addicts were arrested for the killing, but U.S. officials
doubt they were the killers. Civilian prosecutors have refused to
prosecute the two unless police gather more evidence.
   May 13, 1990: Airman John H. Raven and Airman James C. Green
were shot and killed by suspected Communist rebels near Clark.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

   To paraphrase those harried parents in
the 1960 musical ``Bye Bye Birdie'': What's the matter with college
kids today?
   How about fear of fatal sex, soaring inflation, debt, anxiety
and vague notions of the real world? And that's just the start, say
college administrators who are trying to help by offering courses
that ease graduating seniors into adulthood.
   One such program, ``The Last Six Weeks,'' is offered at
Assumption College, a Catholic school of 2,000 students set amid
rolling lawns and quiet woods. Until he signed on, senior Paul
Irish stared into the abyss of life-after-graduation and worried.
   ``Money was a big thing _ how you make ends meet, getting a car,
getting an apartment,'' said the 22-year-old from Auburn. He knew
he wanted to be a history teacher. But he was sketchy on the
details of adult survival.
   ``I thought willpower was everything,'' he said. Now he knows
better.
   ``The Last Six Weeks'' is an optional, non-credit course of
structured late-night chat and pizza that gets into the
nitty-gritty of the necessities like shelter and transportation,
such as how much they cost and how to avoid scams.
   Students learn about picking a career and shopping the job
market, from writing a resume to dealing with sexual harassment and
learning about corporate culture. The last class is about getting
the most out of saying goodbye to college friends.
   Why college students these days need such help isn't clear.
   Members of the ``me generation'' may have become so
self-absorbed they forgot to look around, suggested Brian McCoy,
assistant director of residential life at Assumption. He helped
design the program.
   ``Students don't explore as much as they used to,'' McCoy said.
   Schools also feel pressure to do better, said John N. Gardner, a
vice chancellor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.
   ``A number of corporate leaders are very unhappy about what
we're producing,'' he said. ``This year we're spending $110 billion
on higher education for 13.2 million people. That's about one-third
of what we spend on national defense.
   ``There is a tremendous increased public pressure for
accountability in colleges and universities.''
   One result is that Gardner has focused his attention on the
transitions into and out of college. In March, he organized a
national conference in Atlanta called the ``Senior Year
Experience'' to look at what schools are doing about it.
   Regis College in Weston offers a course in leadership for
students planning management careers. Carroll College in Waukesha,
Wis., sends its seniors to work as consultants to businesses to get
them past ``job shock.'' Seniors at the University of Hartford can
take a course called ``Pluralism Revisited'' to expose them to the
diverse world they are about to enter.
   Unlike college kids in the days of ``Bye Bye Birdie,'' graduates
these days have a harder world to take on, Gardner said.
   ``Sex can kill,'' he said. ``It costs more money to buy a home.
There are far fewer barriers for women and minorities, but on the
other hand there are more personal threats to your health and more
violence.
   ``Students are graduating with staggering debt. You add that all
up and college graduates are a lot more anxious and they count on a
lot fewer certainties than their parents.''
   Marianne Tavares works in human resources at Waters
Chromatography in nearby of Milford and encounters naive college
grads all the time. The ones who make her chuckle say they intend
to be managers making $40,000 in 18 months.
   More troubling are those who, when asked how they would solve a
conflict with a co-worker, say they would take it to the boss.
   ``That's where we see the negative side,'' Tavares said. They
mistakenly believe ``the company is going to take care of them,
you're going to be their parent.''

   The booming metropolitan area is getting
tired of late-night carousers, drunken boaters and people who stand
in traffic, collecting donations for what they say is charity.
   Mayor Bill Frederick and the City Council have scheduled public
hearings in the next two weeks to deal with some of the residents'
gripes.
   City officials are particularly concerned about the growing
number of people approaching drivers for money. Complaints have
come from motorists, shopkeepers, police and homeowners.
   Some officials want to ban the practice, contending it is
dangerous and looks bad to visitors to this tourist area where
Disney World is situated.
   ``We've got no clue as to what some of these charities are,''
the mayor said at a council meeting last week. ``We don't know
where the money goes.''
   Some of the solicitors are hired out of unemployment lines.
Others answer classified ads and make $4 to $6 an hour. Still
others are volunteers.
   In nearby Apopka, Police Chief Tom Collins said he thinks some
of the T-shirted solicitors are merely panhandling.
   ``They're standing in the middle of the road,'' he said. ``I
think it's too dangerous. What would be the liability if one of
these people got hit?''
   Orlando and other communities in Orange, Seminole and Osceola
counties issue hundreds of permits to nonprofit groups and
charities, but only to a few that collect at intersections.
   In most of central Florida, police can stop collecting only if
it poses a danger or impedes traffic.
   Some officials and collectors for charitable groups such as
Easter Seals and drug-education foundations say a large portion of
their money comes from such activities.
   Margaret Fowler, director of the Lighthouse Mission, a shelter
for homeless men, said she opposes a ban.
   Also high on Orlando's list of gripes are people carousing
downtown after 2 a.m. and those driving boats too fast on lakes.
Frederick and several commissioners said they have heard complaints
about reckless and drunken boating.
   The City Council wants to ban drinking on board boats and bar
boaters from going faster than 35 mph during the day and 20 mph at
night. Some lakes in Orlando have speed limits, but there is no
citywide limit.
   Some patrons of downtown bars repeatedly break the law,
especially early in the morning, police said.
   ``They come out and they drink. They buy dope. They urinate on
cars. There is a massive problem,'' said City Attorney Bob Hamilton.
   A proposed ordinance would force bars to close down at 2 a.m.,
when they stop serving liquor, instead of one or two hours later.
   Police Chief Danny Wilson said the carousers do not ``project
the kind of image we want to have for downtown.''
   The Orlando metropolitan area, largely undeveloped a few decades
ago, tripled in population from 1960 to nearly 1 million in 1988.

   The politically charged issue of flag burning
is again before the Supreme Court as the justices hold an
extraordinary session to study a federal law intended to protect
Old Glory's ``physical integrity.''
   Today's oral arguments on the constitutionality of the Flag
Protection Act of 1989 marked the first time in nine years the
justices held such a session after April.
   They are reviewing rulings by federal judges in Washington and
Seattle who said the law violates the freedom of expression
protection granted by the First Amendment. The law was challenged
by demonstrators who burned American flags in the two cities.
   The political stakes are high.
   The court is expected to rule before the end of its current
term, probably in late June or early July. If the law is struck
down, a proposed constitutional amendment to protect the flag
almost certainly would become a leading issue in congressional and
state legislative races this fall.
   While the Bush administration is defending the law, President
Bush and Republican leaders have said they would prefer a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, which would be
unnecessary if the justices uphold the law.
   The Justice Department, in a written brief to the court, said,
``It is the physical assault and accompanying violation of the
flag's physical integrity _ not robust and uninhibited debate _
that occasion the injury that our society should not be called upon
to bear.''
   Department lawyers said the court owes Congress special
deference in this case because an equal branch of government has
determined that flag burning can be outlawed without violating
freedom of speech.
   Lawyers for the demonstrators challenging the law said their
clients ``consider flag burning an essential element of their
political expression because, for them, the flag represents not
glory but oppression.''
   They also said flag desecration is an American tradition. ``The
United States flag was born of a desecration,'' the lawyers said.
``George Washington ... in 1776 ... defaced a British flag by
ordering sewn upon it 13 red and white stripes.''
   And, the attorneys added, the United States should make it clear
the world's leading democracy stands with those who want more
freedom. Last year when the people of Eastern Europe rose up to
protest oppressive communist regimes, they carried national flags
``desecrated by excised centers,'' the lawyers said.
   Democratic congressional leaders, hoping to head off a battle
over amending the Constitution, were the prime sponsors of the Flag
Protection Act.
   The law was passed after the Supreme Court touched off a
political firestorm in June 1989 by striking down a Texas statute
that banned flag desecration.
   The 5-4 ruling said burning the flag as a form of political
protest is protected by the Constitution's free speech guarantees.
   Supporters of the federal law say it differs from the Texas law
because the federal act does not single out flag burning as a means
of expression. The federal law forbids defiling or destruction of
the flag for any purpose, except to destroy a soiled or tattered
flag.
   The Texas law specifically banned flag burning that seriously
offends others.

   Prosecutors consider Dorothea Montalvo
Puente a rare breed, a female serial killer, but they'll first have
to show that the nine boarders the landlady allegedly poisoned were
victims of foul play.
   A judge is deciding whether there is sufficient evidence to hold
the 61-year-old woman for trial on charges of murdering seven
tenants found buried in her boardinghouse yard and two others whose
bodies turned up elsewhere.
   The preliminary hearing began in Municipal Court on April 27, a
year and a half after her arrest.
   In eight of the cases, a cause of death was never determined.
Whether the nine people were even homicides has not been
established; the boarders, dead for weeks to years, were too
decomposed for autopsies to tell what killed them.
   Assistant District Attorney George Williamson is trying to show
that Puente, who has a record of administering stupefying drugs to
people she intended to rob, poisoned the nine people over a
six-year period for their Social Security and other benefit checks.
She could face the death penalty if convicted.
   But her lawyers contend the tenants, ranging in age from 52 to
80 and most poor and alcoholic, could have died from a variety of
medical problems. Among their ailments were a brain tumor, lung
disease, heart disease and diabetes.
   ``Those people all died a natural death,'' defense attorney
Peter Vlautin said recently.
   More than 100 witnesses are expected to testify by the time the
hearing ends in three to four weeks.
   ``I have not killed anyone. The checks I cashed, yes,'' Puente
said in a TV interview after her arrest.
   On Thursday, a jailhouse informant testified that Puente
admitted she poisoned her tenants because she had gotten ``a little
greedy.''
   Michelle Crowl, whose cell was two doors from Puente's, said the
landlady told her in late 1988 or early 1989 that she killed her
tenants by giving them an overdose of prescription drugs mixed with
alcohol.
   Defense attorneys accused Crowl of lying to buy her freedom. In
exchange for her testimony, prosecutors agreed to release her from
jail on probation and not seek a prison term for a parole violation
on a drug conviction.
   Other testimony by an ex-convict and a doctor portrays Puente as
a woman who had extensive knowledge about medications and used
deception to obtain them.
   Former tenants described Puente alternately as a devoted,
motherly caretaker and a hot-tempered woman who had a penchant for
swearing and sought control of some boarders' money.
   In only one death was a cause ever listed. The 1982 death of a
61-year-old man from an apparent codeine overdose was considered
accidental until investigators began digging up seven bodies from
Puente's yard.
   A prescription tranquilizer flurazepam, sold under the trade
name Dalmane, was detected in all seven bodies. Doctors have
testified that it can be toxic if taken in large enough doses in
combination with other drugs or alcohol.
   A total of nine other drugs were found in the boardinghouse
bodies.
   Their doctors and fellow boarders have testified most of them
were heavy drinkers and many took prescription drugs. One tenant,
according to her doctor, was a prescription drug abuser who
preferred Valium.

<HEAD>Presidential Commission to Call for FAA Changes, Won't Lay Blame</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential commission on terrorism is
expected to call for changes in federal aviation security
operations without laying blame for the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103.
   The seven-member commission headed by former Labor Secretary Ann
McLaughlin is giving its report to President Bush on Tuesday,
followed by a briefing at the White House for relatives of some of
the 270 people killed in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
   Bush appointed the panel after family members demanded a
congressional investigation into government actions before and
after the attack. The relatives withdrew the demand pending outcome
of the nine-month presidential inquiry.
   Investigators in Britain say the Boeing 747 was downed by a
plastic explosive concealed in a radio cassette player by still
unidentified terrorists.
   The terrorism commission, which includes four members of
Congress and three former government figures, steered away from
criminal investigation of the Lockerbie bombing. It has tried to
determine whether errors by any federal agency, the airline, or
others might have allowed it to occur.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said they expect the report to be critical of the
agency which has worldwide responsibility for the security of U.S.
airlines.
   Aides to the commission have said investigators found ``no
smoking gun'' that would allow the report to lay blame for the
bombing. But during hearings, commission members strongly
criticized the FAA and Pan Am for security flaws and the State
Department for poor handling of victims' relatives after the
incident.
   Ms. McLaughlin met with Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
last week to brief him on the report, but a department spokesman
said there was no in-depth discussion and that Skinner did not get
a copy of the report.
   A congressional source said the panel recommends a revamp of the
FAA's security office to give it higher visibility.
   ``It's pretty hard on the FAA and calls for some changes in FAA
operations,'' said the source, who characterized the report in
advance only on condition of anonymity.
   The FAA said Thursday it had removed Raymond Salazar as civil
aviation security chief, putting the office under his superior,
Monte Belger, associate administrator for aviation standards.
   Salazar, who will take over an FAA management training facility
in Florida, was criticized by commission members for lapses in
security before and after the Pan Am bombing.
   Victims' relatives, who had called for his resignation,
applauded his removal, but FAA Administrator James Busey said
Salazar's departure was not connected with the imminent release of
the report.
   Commission members have raised concerns about the government's
policy of not informing passengers of most terrorist threats.
   Victims' relatives claim government employees avoided the flight
because of warnings posted at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. But
commission investigators said last month they found no evidence of
cancellations by such passengers.
   Some family members have braced themselves for disappointment,
based on early indications of the report's contents.
   One family member said there were rumors that the report would
call for a halt to installation of sophisticated Thermal Neutron
Analysis (TNA) bomb detection devices ordered by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   ``Halting the installation of TNA bomb-detection units in
airports would send the right signal to terrorists and the wrong
signal to the traveling public,'' said Ted Reina, whose daughter
Jocelyn was a flight attendant on Flight 103.
   Chairwoman McLaughlin, at the commission's last hearing in
April, criticized the FAA for ordering carriers to buy the $1
million machines which airlines say have not been sufficiently
tested. But commission member Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., has
welcomed installation of the detectors, although he says the
government should pay for them.
   The panel held five public hearings in Washington and traveled
to Europe for interviews with aviation and airline officials in
France, Germany and Britain. Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt and
switched to a different airliner in London before leaving for New
York on a path over Lockerbie.
   Other commission members besides Ms. McLaughlin and Oberstar
include Sens. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Alfonse D'Amato,
R-N.Y.; Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, D-Ark.: retired Air Force
Gen. Thomas C. Richards, and Edward Hidalgo, an attorney and former
assistant Navy secretary.
   At least two other airliner bombings have occurred since the
Lockerbie disaster, killing 171 people aboard a French UTA jetliner
in September and 107 on a Colombian jet in November.

   Iran has begun military maneuvers in the
Persian Gulf, including for the first time ``combat submarines,''
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the weeklong maneuvers
under the command of Rear Adm. Ali Shamkhani include naval and air
units of the Revolutionary Guards Corps.
   Shamkhani was quoted as saying the exercises, which began
Sunday, were being carried out in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea,
spread over an area of 10,000 square miles.
   The agency did not elaborate on the ``combat submarines.''
   During its 8-year-old war with Iraq, Iran displayed a small
domestically manufactured submarine, a few yards long, mounted with
a single gun and apparently designed to be ridden externally by
frogmen.

<HEAD>Governor's Race Hinging on Fiscal Fallout After Dukakis Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The collapse of the ``Massachusetts miracle''
touted by Michael Dukakis in his failed 1988 presidential campaign
is giving Republicans their best hope in years to take the
governor's office.
   But Democrats are far from doomed, and a Democratic former
attorney general who served with Dukakis now appears to be the
favorite to succeed him. After three terms as governor, Dukakis is
not seeking re-election.
   Republicans, who have been locked out of the governor's office
for 16 years, are fighting to end what they call ``one-party rule''
in the state.
   The GOP's prospects rose as a slump in the state economy and a
slowdown in tax collections led to burgeoning deficits. Dukakis and
his fellow Democrats got the blame for mismanaging the state's
finances.
   Dukakis and his presidential bid remain central issues in the
governor's race. This was apparent last week as the state House
debated and sent to the Senate a $1.2 billion tax bill designed to
improve the state's shaky finances.
   ``In 1988, this Legislature was in the process of mortgaging the
future of Massachusetts,'' said House Minority Leader Steven
Pierce, the Republican Party's endorsed candidate for governor.
   Political observers say with Dukakis absent from the race,
Republicans must campaign against his policies and link them to the
Democratic Party as a whole.
   ``His name won't be on the ballot, but that's the name people
will see when they look at these candidates,'' said Todd Domke, a
Republican political consultant. ``The only way they can vote
against Dukakis is to vote against the Democratic slate.''
   The Democratic gubernatorial hopefuls, too, have distanced
themselves from Dukakis as they prepare for next month's state
convention, which will determine the candidates who will appear on
September's primary ballot.
   Former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, who leads in public
opinion polls, has been a frequent critic of current policies even
though he was a past Dukakis supporter.
   Bellotti's main Democratic rival, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, has
been a loyal deputy to Dukakis but also has pointed out
disagreements.
   The other two Democratic candidates have not worried about
tactful breaks.
   John Silber, on leave as Boston University president, is a
sharp-tongued conservative whose support has grown recently,
improving his chances to make the primary ballot. Political
analysts say he might be drawing support away from Republicans.
   State Rep. John Flood, who is considered a long shot, warned
about excessive state spending at the height of the ``miracle''
years.
   On the Republican side, Pierce will face former U.S. Attorney
William Weld in September. Pierce won the party's endorsement at
the state GOP convention in March.
   Some political observers say that as November approaches, an
anti-Dukakis campaign will become less viable.
   ``Michael Dukakis is continuing to fade from public view, fade
as a target,'' said Dan Payne, a Democratic consultant. ``He's not
accommodating them.''
   ``Pretty soon they will realize the Democratic candidates in the
race now are the ones they have to take shots at,'' he said.
   Republicans, however, saw the debate over the tax increase as
another opportunity to boost their chances and knock Democrats for
the state's financial slide.
   ``I think this is going to be the dominant issue of the
campaign,'' Pierce said of the tax package.
   Of the major Democratic gubernatorial contenders, however, only
Murphy reacted favorably to the tax proposal. That didn't stop
Republicans from seizing the chance to criticize Democratic
policies.
   ``They have to show momentum now,'' Payne said.

   Bootleg liquor containing methanol was
blamed for the deaths of 11 people, and 44 others were hospitalized
in critical condition after drinking it, the official APS news
agency reported.
   All the victims had consumed the local liquor, illegally
produced and sold in plastic bottles near Sidi Bel-Abbes, about 250
miles west of Algiers, the agency reported Sunday.
   Police opened an investigation into the poisonings, the agency
said, and the the 44 victims in regional hospitals were undergoing
detoxification.
   Toxicologists analyzing the liquor said it contained at least
18.75 percent methanol, a compound that can cause blindness or
death if consumed above a level of 15 percent, APS said.
   Most alcohol-based beverages contain ethanol, a less-dangerous
alcohol compound.

<HEAD>Medicine Shortage Leaves Thousands in Soviet Capital Afflicted
with Lice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of young Muscovites suffer from head
lice, and a shortage of disinfectants leaves no remedy except
combing their hair with vinegar and taking a shower, a newspaper
reported.
   Last year in the Soviet capital, sanitation clinics reported
that only 4,000 children sought treatment for lice, Moskovskaya
Pravda, the city Communist Party newspaper, said Sunday.
   ``And how many more did not seek help?'' it asked, saying
parents' embarrassment and ignorance about the pests make that
number only ``the tip of the iceberg.''
   Statistics on the problem were not published until 1986, leaving
health authorities ``unarmed in the battle'' against lice, the
newspaper said.
   Moscow does not have enough sanitary stations, medicinal baths,
or public health instructors to battle the lice, said A. Frolova, a
senior scientific worker of the All-Union Scientific Research
Institute of Preventative Toxicology and Disinfection.
   The government recalled soaps containing the pesticide DDT,
which is harmful to the environment and banned in the United
States, and did not offer any adequate substitutes, she said.
   ``Civilized countries have all kinds of methods: shampoos,
aerosols, lotions,'' she said, noting that Moscow pharmacies don't
have the effective treatments that are available in the West or
even in Hungary.
   ``Our pharmaceutical industry is in the Stone Age,'' said T.
Borisenko, deputy chief of the supply and sales department of the
``Pharmatsia'' concern that distributes drugs to the city's
pharmacies and clinics.
   One effective medication that is available in Hungary is being
supplied for the first time to some city clinics and children's
hospitals, he said. Two years ago, there was a demand for 8,000
bottles of the medication, and this year at least 50,000 bottles
will be needed, Borisenko said.
   The problem becomes acute after children are sent off to summer
camps and return to the city carrying the parasites.
   Until more medication is available, Moskovskaya Pravda advised
its readers to use combs with cotton wads soaked in vinegar, then
take a shower and put on a change of clothes.
   ``See how simple it is,'' the newspaper added sarcastically,
noting general shortages of goods. ``If, of course, you can find
combs, cotton vinegar and soap.''

<HEAD>Law Aimed at Animal-Rights Activists Enacted in Kansas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas has enacted a law to punish
animal-rights activists for entering and damaging farms and
research laboratories.
   A Humane Society official, however, said the law will hamper
investigations into abuses.
   Gov. Mike Hayden signed the measure over the weekend, calling it
one of the first of its kind in the nation. ``It properly provides
increased penalties for damage to research facilities and
agriculture operations,'' he said.
   The law was prompted by militant actions around the nation,
including vandalism and theft of animals.
   Under the law, entering farms, ranches or research operations
and damaging property are punishable by up to 10 years in prison
and a $10,000 fine.
   Wendell Maddox, regional director for the Humane Society of the
United States, said an amendment barring individuals from entering
an animal operation to take photos will make it difficult for his
group to document abuses.
   ``It's more than obvious their intention is to keep us out of
`puppy mills,''' he said. The so-called puppy mills, which raise
puppies for sale, have been criticized by animal-rights groups for
unhealthy conditions.
   Hayden said the law does not conflict with humane societies'
authority to deal with abuse. The Republican signed a law two years
ago aimed at stopping puppy mills and said he supports efforts to
``close down these disgraceful operations.''
   But Maddox said the act will make organizations such as his more
dependent on assistance from law enforcement agencies.
   ``Law enforcement historically doesn't consider animal abuse a
priority,'' he said. ``Unless we gather evidence, nothing gets
done.''

   Rangers searching for a killer
crocodile on the northeast coast of Australia harpooned the animal
after noticing pieces of clothing in its teeth, authorities said
today.
   They believe the 10-foot crocodile attacked and ate a
43-year-old man who had been walking along a beach Friday night or
early Saturday morning.
   Police killed the reptile Sunday after finding remains of the
man just off Groote Eylandt, an island 360 miles east of Darwin.
   The rangers searched for the missing man, Albert Juzelinunas,
late Saturday and Sunday, and found the crocodile in the waters off
Bartalumba Bay. They harpooned the crocodile and later shot it dead
when they saw pieces of clothing in the animal's teeth, police said.
   Juzeliunas, who worked for the government communications company
Telecom, had gone to the island Friday with three other employees
to install a radio communications system.

   The killing of three U.S. enlisted
men within 10 days indicates Communist rebels may have abandoned
the quest for ``quality targets'' and will strike at any American
service member in this country.
   Police believe New People's Army guerrillas gunned down two Air
Force servicemen late Sunday near Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of
Manila.
   U.S. officials identified the dead servicemen as Airmen John H.
Raven and James C. Green, on temporary assignment from Kunsan Air
Base in South Korea.
   Nine days earlier, gunmen killed Marine Gunnery Sgt. John
Fredette near Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles west of the capital.
Fredette, 34, was on temporary duty from the Marine air station at
El Toro, Calif.
   Although no one has claimed responsibility for the three
killings, U.S. and many Filipino officials believe the rebels were
responsible.
   All three killings were believed timed to today's start of talks
on the future of U.S. military bases, which the guerrillas want
closed.
   Although the rebels have repeatedly threatened to kill
Americans, U.S. officials expected them to try to assassinate a
senior diplomat or military officer.
   They cited the April 1989 assassination of U.S. Army Col. James
``Nick'' Rowe, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who was ambushed and
slain by the rebels on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military
Assistance Group in suburban Quezon City.
   ``Rowe was a quality target,'' said one U.S. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``They don't get the same propaganda
value from killing an enlisted man.''
   In October 1987, rebels killed two enlisted U.S. airmen and a
retired U.S. Air Force sergeant near Clark. That triggered a
backlash among the Filipino population in the area after the U.S.
military temporarily banned Americans from leaving post to shop in
local stores.
   The quality target theory was also based on recent statements
from the rebels indicating they would be selective in deciding whom
to kill.
   In March, rebel commander Romulo Kintanar said the guerrillas
would be ``highly selective in launching military operations in the
cities.''
   But all three recent victims were low-ranking enlisted men who
were not even permanently assigned in the Philippines. It appeared
they were selected at random simply because of nationality.
   After Fredette's slaying, U.S. officials suggested he may have
been killed by mistake because the rebels thought he was an
officer. Fredette's nickname was ``the colonel'' because of his
maturity and bearing.
   It is unlikely Sunday's victims were mistaken for officers.
   The rebels have been fighting the Philippine government for more
than 21 years. If they now are willing to kill any U.S. service
member, the security implications are serious, both for American
and Filipino authorities.
   The United States maintains about 40,000 troops, Defense
Department civilians and military dependents at the six bases, some
in rebel strongholds.
   Thousands more come temporarily for training at Clark or aboard
American warships that call at Subic.
   In addition, the U.S. Embassy estimates 80,000 to 100,000
American civilians live in the Philippines. Protecting all of them
is impossible.
   ``We can provide good security for senior diplomats, ranking
officers, people like that,'' said one American official speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``But how do you protect every private?''
   Faced with security threats, the State Department is considering
increasing hazardous duty pay for embassy personnel. Diplomatic
sources say the proposal is opposed by the Defense Department
because it would not automatically cover service personnel.
   The only way military personnel could receive extra compensation
would be through awarding combat pay. But that would mean most
dependents would have to return to the United States.
   A sizeable reduction in the American military community would
undermine Filipino support for the bases at a time when a new
agreement on the installations is in doubt.
   Many Filipinos who support the bases do so because of the
estimated $1 billion they pump into the economy every year. Without
large numbers of dependents, many of whom live and shop on the
local economy, that figure would decline dramatically.

<HEAD>Bush Backing House Statehood For Puerto Rico Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is a 51-star flag in America's future? Puerto
Rico could vote to become a state in two years under legislation
pending in the House and backed by President Bush.
   The target date would be Columbus Day 1992, nearly 500 years
since Christopher Columbus claimed the island for Spain and almost
100 years since the United States claimed it in the
Spanish-American War.
   ``I want it to become the 51st state,'' Bush said last week in a
letter to Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, ranking Republican member on the
Interior subcommittee overseeing Puerto Rican affairs.
   Lagomarsino and subcommittee Chairman Ron de Lugo, the
non-voting delegate from the Virgin Islands, introduced a bill
Thursday that calls for Puerto Ricans to hold a referendum in 1991
to choose among statehood, independence or continued commonwealth
status with added authority.
   Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
   De Lugo says he will hold hearings in June in New York to
determine whether Puerto Ricans living in the United States should
be allowed to vote with the islanders in the referendum.
   If statehood wins, the 3.3 million Puerto Ricans would comprise
the 26th most populous state and send six or seven House members to
Congress in addition to two senators.
   In a poll published in February, 43 percent of Puerto Ricans
favored statehood, 36 percent favored enhanced commonwealth status,
5 percent called for independence, and 9 percent said they did not
know. A similar poll six months earlier had found 41 percent
favored statehood.
   Both recent polls showed a switch from a year earlier, when
enhanced commonwealth was the single most popular choice.
   Status has been an obsession on the island since Spain ruled.
After more 400 years as a colony, Puerto Rico won autonomy and full
representation in the Spanish parliament in 1897.
   The next year, it lost all self-governance when the United
States took possession through the Treaty of Paris.
   The people were in political limbo until 1917 when they were
made U.S. citizens.
   While that meant they could be drafted into the U.S. armed
forces and send delegates to the political conventions, they never
have voted in presidential elections and do not have voting
representation in Congress.
   ``How can we applaud the exciting and momentous movements toward
freedom in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere while
refusing to grant our own citizens the right to
self-determination?'' Bush asked in his letter.
   Until last week, it looked as if Congress was trying to avoid
the issue.
   The legislation was approved by the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee but had to go to the Senate Finance Committee
as well, because of tax issues involved. Hearings have been held
there but no vote has been scheduled.
   De Lugo said that under a previous arrangement he was waiting
for the bill to clear the Senate before taking it up in the House.
But with time running out on the congressional session, he said,
the House decided to go forward with its own bill.
   The issue is complicated by financial considerations, including
special federal tax exemptions for businesses on the island that
would have to change with statehood. Some people believe the change
would cause business to leave, hurting Puerto Ricans financially.
   The Senate bill states the steps that would be taken to make
Puerto Rico a state, enhanced commonwealth or independent.
   ``Our bill would require the development of legislation to
implement winning status next year,'' said de Lugo. Final federal
action could not take effect without another vote by Puerto Rico,
which would be in July 1992.
   ``The status development would then be effective in October
1992,'' de Lugo said.

<HEAD>Agriculture Department Forecasts Bumper Winter Wheat Crop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last week's Agriculture Department forecast of
a bumper 1990 winter wheat crop has a pretty good chance of being
correct.
   Based on surveys just before May 1, the department's
agricultural statistics board estimated production at slightly more
than 2.09 billion bushels, a 44 percent increase from the
weather-damaged 1989 harvest.
   And since winter wheat makes up about three-fourths of the U.S.
all-wheat total, a fairly normal yield of spring-planted wheat
should put the nation's relatively skimpy supply back into shape.
   The board, a part of the department's National Agricultural
Statistics Service, takes pains to explain the crop surveys and
their accuracy.
   Revised estimates are published each month during the growing
season of specific crops. By August or so, it should be fairly
clear what the total U.S. wheat output will be this year.
   ``The May 1 forecast has been below the final estimate seven
times and above three times,'' last week's report said. ``This does
not imply that the May 1 winter wheat forecast this year is likely
to understate or overstate final production.''
   A year ago, the May estimate of 1989 winter wheat production was
slightly more than 1.43 billion bushels. The final 1989 figure
included in last week's report was a bit more than 1.45 billion
bushels.
   In a related supply-and-demand report issued by the department's
world agricultural outlook board, analysts projected _ based on
yield trends, an assumption of normal weather and other factors _ a
total U.S. wheat harvest this year of more than 2.69 billion
bushels.
   That would be the third-largest U.S. wheat crop on record,
exceeded by the 1981 and 1982 harvests of 2.79 billion and 2.77
billion bushels, respectively.
   A year ago, the same outlook board, which represents the
department's Economic Research Service and the Foreign Agricultural
Service, projected a 1989 total wheat production of 2.05 billion
bushels. The final was less than 2.04 billion.
   The USDA winter wheat estimate announced last Thursday afternoon
was substantially higher than most private forecasters and
commodity traders expected. Many of those believed the department's
all-wheat projection would be in the range of 2.3 billion to 2.5
billion bushels.
   One maverick, however, was Sparks Commodities Inc. of Memphis,
Tenn., which the week before forecast the 1990 wheat crop at 2.7
billion bushels _ almost exactly matching the USDA projection
announced on May 10.

   The 1988 drought did more than ravage crops,
send commodity prices upward and put livestock on expensive diets.
   Drought also chewed into farm productivity, says the Agriculture
Department. As the economists say, that happens when output drops
faster than input.
   Overall, said the department's Economic Research Service, farm
production _ output _ dropped 7.7 percent in 1988. The total
quantity of labor, machinery and land used in 1988 _ inputs _
declined 1.6 percent.
   There are other inputs, too, but the three basic groups
accounted for almost 69 percent of the total in 1988. Others
include feed, seed, livestock, taxes and interest, and chemicals.
   When all the factors are compared and expressed as units in an
index, the report showed that 1988 farm production per unit of
input _ productivity _ dropped 6.2 percent.
   Expressed another way, U.S. farm productivity in 1988 averaged
120 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison. That was down from
128 percent in 1987.
   ``This decline reflected drought conditions, rather than
technical deterioration,'' the report said.
   Regionally, the figures showed farm productivity in 1988 dropped
16.8 percent in the Corn Belt, 15.2 percent in the Northern Plains
and Lake States, 2.8 percent in the Northeast, and 2.2 percent in
the Mountain states.
   Productivity rose 13.6 percent in the Mississippi Delta, 10
percent in the Southeast, 7.1 percent in Appalachia, 1.8 percent in
the Southern Plains, and 0.7 percent in the Pacific region.

   The estimated wholesale value of cut flowers,
potted plants and other floriculture crops rose 6 percent in 1989
to about $2.43 billion, according to an annual report by the
Agriculture Department.
   ``All major groups except foliage plants had increased wholesale
values,'' the report said. ``Cut flowers increased 2 percent in
value to $469 million. Potted flowering plants, valued at $522
million, increased 3 percent.''
   But foliage plants dropped 1 percent in 1989 to $476 million.
   The report said sales of bedding plants were estimated at a
wholesale value of $867 million, up 9 percent from 1988. The value
of cut cultivated greens rose 9 percent to $98.8 million.

<HEAD>US-Chile Agreement a Major Step, State Department Negotiator Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One more step remains before US-Chilean
relations can be normalized, now that Chile has agreed to pay
compensation for the 1976 slaying in Washington of a Chilean
opposition figure and his aide, a U.S. negotiator says.
   The ``agreement in principle'' was concluded last week following
talks between Chilean and U.S. negotiators in Washington, State
Department legal adviser Abraham D. Sofaer said Sunday.
   He said the second step toward normalizing relations is to see
that the killers of Chilean exile leader Orlando Letelier and his
aide, Ronni Moffitt, are brought to justice. Letelier and Moffitt
died in a car bombing in Washington.
   ``Once we have both those things done, relations between both
these two countries can be completely normalized,'' Sofaer said.
``So it is very significant. It has taken us years to get here.''
   The agreement with the new government of Chilean President
Patricio Aylwin marks a reversal of the stance taken by Aylwin's
predecessor, right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who seized power in
the 1973 overthrow.
   Aylwin, who defeated a Pinochet-backed candidate in elections to
replace the military government, has promised full cooperation with
U.S. officials in the case. Aylwin took power in March.
   Sofaer underscored that Chile would make payments without
conceding any government liability for the death of Letelier, who
served in the government of Salvador Allende, a Marxist president
who died in a 1973 coup in Chile.
   ``We have agreed in principle to arbitration, in effect, to set
an amount of compensation to be paid to those people damaged by the
bombing,'' he said. The amount would be set by an international
tribunal.
   At the time of the Sept. 21, 1976, bombing, Letelier and Ms.
Moffitt were working for the Institute for Policy Studies. The
survivors include Letelier's widow and Ms. Moffitt's husband.
   A federal judge in 1980 concluded that the Pinochet government
and its agents were responsible for the deaths of Letelier and
Moffitt and ordered the Chilean government to pay $2.9 million in
compensation to the survivors.
   But the relatives have been unable to collect, and the United
States is expected to ask the tribunal to award at least the $2.9
million and 10 years' interest, The New York Times reported Sunday.
   In Chile, the issue of reparations has been seen as key battle
between Aylwin and Pinochet, who remains as army commander and has
promised to block human rights investigations of the military.
   Letelier served as ambassador to Washington and was foreign
minister during the Allende rule. In exile after the coup, he
became a severe critic of Pinochet's rule.
   Sofaer said the issue of civil payments is wholly separate from
criminal cases in the United States against former officials of the
Chilean secret police indicted in the killings.

   Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber says stale
ideas, high costs and a fear of bad reviews have made Broadway ``a
mess.''
   ``They're still talking about the smashes of the '40s and '50s,
which I hugely admire,'' Webber said Saturday. ``But not to the
exclusion of what's going on elsewhere.''
   The 42-year-old composer and creator of such hits as ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Cats'' and ``Evita,'' received an
honorary doctorate of fine arts during commencement exercises at
the University of South Carolina.
   ``Broadway is a mess,'' he told reporters afterward. ``There is
no question about it.''

   John F. Kennedy Jr. may have a brighter future
on stage than in a courtroom.
   The assistant prosecutor, who twice has flunked the bar exam,
plays the guitar and sings in the movie ``A Matter of Degrees,''
which is scheduled to open in Europe but has no U.S. distributor,
according to the May 21 issue of People.
   The son of the slain president, who must pass the bar exam on
his third try in July or lose his $30,000-a-year job, made his
professional acting debut opposite Christina Haag in ``Winners'' in
an off-off-Broadway theater in 1988.
   ``He is the finest young actor I have seen in 12 years,'' said
the theater's operator, Nye Heron.
   But Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Onassis, may have vetoed a
longer run in ``Winners,'' the magazine reported.
   ``The acting drove Jackie crazy,'' said Harrison Rainie,
co-author of ``Growing Up Kennedy.''

   Producer Fred Caruso wouldn't rewrite ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities'' to get permission to shoot a scene in a
New Jersey courthouse.
   New Jersey Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz on Sunday offered to
allow the filmmakers to shoot a scene in a courthouse stairwell if
they cut out a part showing an actor slamming shut an iron gate to
keep a ``mob of blacks'' at bay.
   ``I won't rewrite the script for the judge, or for anyone,''
Caruso said in a telephone interview.
   The movie version of Tom Wolfe's novel about a Wall Street bond
salesman who gets enmeshed in the Bronx court system has been
accused of unfairly portraying blacks and Hispanics as criminals.
   Caruso said the judge is ``misinformed'' about the racial
overtones of the scene. He said he would meet with Essex County
officials today to gain access to the courthouse.
   Wilentz said in a statement Sunday, ``I will not permit a New
Jersey courthouse, courtroom or corridor to be used to portray
blacks as having so little respect for law they would riot and
threaten a judge's life.''

<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Porter wears his
hair in a ponytail, refuses to send his children to school and
disdains running water, electricity and democracy.
   Porter, whose friends know him by his tribal name,
Sakowkenonkwas, is a Mohawk chief. The 46-year-old carpenter has
built a house on the reservation, and his family lives off produce
from a large garden. They speak Iroquois.
   But modern practices have intruded.
   A 9-month-old dispute over casino gambling has torn apart the
9,000-member reservation, culminating in two slayings May 1.
Porter, his Choctaw Indian wife and their six children were among
more than 500 people driven from their homes to a refugee center in
Cornwall, Ontario.
   ``I've never seen this in my life,'' Porter said. ``I never
dreamed people would do this to other people. A true Mohawk doesn't
carry a shotgun. He doesn't bring dissension. He tries to remove
turmoil.''
   Since the killings, Canadian and New York police have sealed off
the reservation with roadblocks, keeping non-residents out and
effectively closing the casinos, along with many other businesses
on Mohawk land.
   Four Mohawks were arrested by Canadian police Sunday in an
investigation of one of the slayings, but no charges were
immediately filed.
   Supporters of gambling say the six casinos and bingo parlors on
the American side of the reservation produce jobs and revenue.
Busloads of visitors are lured to the gaming houses by slot
machines, roulette and craps.
   But opponents such as Porter say gambling has brought drugs,
guns and prostitution and is destroying an old and valued lifestyle.
   Porter was appointed by the tribe's elders to the Council of
Traditional Chiefs, one of three fractious councils governing the
reserve straddling the Canadian border.
   He wants the casinos closed. Elected tribal leaders have said
they will hold a referendum on the gambling issue sometime in June.
   But Porter is disdainful of democracy, believing people should
be led by those chosen for their ``character and goodness.''
   ``I was raised with the old Mohawk values and I've always
embraced those teachings in life,'' he said.
   His house lacks running water, electricity, a television or a
telephone. Many Mohawks, in contrast, have factory jobs off the
reservation, TV sets in their homes and satellite dishes in their
yards.
   ``When I was a child I cherished serenity,'' Porter said. ``I
don't want electricity and phones because I don't want to bring the
trappings of the fast life into my life.''
   Such modern comforts also have brought alcoholism, drug abuse
and other social ills, Porter said.

<TEXT>
   As he gets ready to leave Washington for
Paris, Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin is telling American college
graduates to get ready for a changing world.
   ``Perhaps a Soviet ambassador has more reason to say that, since
in my country, a week _ and sometimes a day _ brings changes which
otherwise would have taken years,'' Dubinin said Sunday at
commencement ceremonies for George Washington University's Elliott
School of International Affairs.
   He told the class of 1990 that it was entering ``a unique world,
which is changing rapidly as never before.''
   The speech was Dubinin's last scheduled formal public appearance
in Washington before his departure to become the Soviet Union's
ambassador to France.
   Dubinin, who has headed the Soviet embassy here since 1986, is
being succeeded by Aleksandr A. Bessmertnhkh, currently the Soviet
Union's first deputy foreign minister and a veteran expert on U.S.
affairs.
   ``Perhaps for the first time, mankind now has a chance to rid
itself of the ideological, political and military confrontation
among states in order to address the problems which call for joint
efforts,'' said Dubinin.

<HEAD>Report: Make Schools More Productive, Not Richer</HEAD>

   An education researcher says the problem in
American schools is waste, not a shortage of cash.
   ``American schools actually are shortchanging the nation by
wasting some $100 billion a year through sprawling bureaucracy and
outmoded technology,'' Lewis J. Perelman of the Hudson Institute
said Sunday.
   In a rebuttal to those who claim increased education spending
will improve student achievement, he said: ``More spending on more
of the same education will waste resources, weaken the U.S. economy
and undermine the nation's global competitiveness.''
   In a report released Sunday, ``The `Acanemia' Deception,''
Perelman said the United States spent $3,310 to educate each
student from preschool to grade 12 in 1985. The expenditure is
second only to Switzerland, which spent $3,683. The figures are
based on a special 1985 index of purchasing power of industrial
nations.
   The statistics contradict a recent analysis by the Economic
Policy Institute that said the United States trailed 13 other
industrial nations in spending on elementary and secondary
education.
   The EPI recommended adding at least $20 billion per year to the
nation's kindergarten through 12th grade spending.
   Among Perelmen's recommendations were:
   _Every education and training institution, organization and
program in the United States should set aside at least 1 percent of
its gross revenues for investment in research and development. The
funds could be pooled in a common fund administered by a new
National Institute for Learning Technology.
   _The goal of the new investment in educational initiative should
be to double the productivity of U.S. education.
   _Every student in America should have access to a ``distance
learning'' network by the year 2001. He explained that teachers can
instruct students across the state or country at the same time with
the two-way video.

<HEAD>Dubcek Says 1968 Uprising Foretold Today's Changes in Eastern
Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Prague Spring reform movement of 1968,
crushed by Red Army tanks, helped plant the seeds of the
revolutionary changes now sweeping Eastern Europe, Alexander Dubcek
told American University graduates.
   Dubcek, in his commencement address Sunday, also said
Czechoslovakia began to fear a loss of identity after the Soviet
invasion of 1968.
   ``An act of violence and malevolence relegated us to the role of
a pawn in a great game of politics,'' Dubcek said. ``Once again, we
were reminded that our country lies at the front line, at the
frontier of the Cold War.''
   But he said the country's push toward reform more than two
decades ago influenced today's changes in Eastern Europe.
   Dubcek, who headed his country's Communist Party at the time of
the 1968 Soviet invasion, said the transition to democracy should
be ``smooth, gradual, cultured, civilized.''
   Czechoslovakia's ``Velvet Revolution'' last fall brought Dubcek
back to public life as chairman of the country's Federal Parliament.
   At Sunday's ceremony, American University also awarded Dubcek an
honorary degree, calling him ``a symbol in the face of tyranny''
for launching the Prague Spring reforms and trying to create a new
``socialism with a human face.''

<HEAD>North Korea Promises To Release Soldiers' Remains, U.S. To Improve
Contacts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea today said it will release
the remains of some U.S. soldiers killed in the Korean War, and a
South Korean newspaper reported Washington plans to upgrade
contacts with the Communist north.
   Chosun Ilbo, a leading newspaper, quoted anonymous sources as
saying Washington wants to include diplomats up to the
ambassadorial level and will carry on such contacts in new
unspecified locations.
   North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, said the Pyongyang government will return ``some unearthed
remains of U.S. soldiers'' to the United States through U.S.
congressmen at the border village of Panmunjom May 28.
   There was no immediate comment from Washington on the reports.
   North Korean officials meeting last month with U.S. diplomats in
Beijing offered to return the remains of five U.S. soldiers killed
in the Korean War, Japan's JiJi news agency reported Saturday.
   United States diplomats reportedly have met North Korean
officials in Beijing eight times since early last year in efforts
to persuade the North to open its doors and improve relations with
capitalist South Korea.
   Washington and North Korean leaders have no diplomatic
relations, and the United States maintains 43,000 troops in rival
South Korea to deter an attack from the north.
   According to U.S. Defense Department figures, about 8,200 U.S.
soldiers were unaccounted for at the end of the war, with 345 of
those listed as possible prisoners of war.
   North Korea is one of the last hard-line communist states and
one of the most isolated countries in the world. It has not
instituted political and economic reforms such as those in Eastern
Europe.
   Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong has made a personal appeal that
Washington ``be prudent in its contacts'' with North Korea,
according to Yonhap, South Korea's the national news agency.
   Choi met last week with Richard Solomon, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for Asian and Pacific Affairs. Yonhap said the
two discussed North Korea's return of the remains of U.S. soldiers
killed in the 1950-53 Korean War.
   `Choi reaffirmed the government's stance that prudence should
prevail in that such contacts would contribute to easing tension on
the Korean peninsula,'' Yonhap said, quoting an anonymous
government official.
   It said Solomon reaffirmed Washington would not positively
respond to North Korea's call for improved ties unless ``it met a
set of conditions.''
   It said Solomon reaffirmed Washington would not positively
respond to North Korea's call for improved ties unless ``it met a

   These conditions included agreement for more confidence building
measures in the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and South Korea,
abandonment of terrorism and adherence to the safeguards clause in
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   The United States imposed sanctions against North Korea after
the November 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner off Burma,
allegedly by North Korean agents. The sanctions, which included a
ban on meetings between U.S. and North Korean officials, were
lifted just before the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.

   Share prices surged on the Tokyo stock market
Monday, and the dollar arrested an early fall against the Japanese
yen to close moderately lower.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 530.51 points, or 1.68
percent, to reach 32,042.65 points at the market close. Tokyo's
main barometer rose 531.88 points Friday.
   The dollar closed the afternoon session at 153.35 yen, down 0.80
yen from its finish Friday at 154.15 yen. After starting at 152.45,
the currency fluctuated between 152.45 yen and 153.90 yen.
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds
rose 87.69 points by 3:00 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT) Monday, up from its
Friday close at 87.40 percent. Their yield dropped to 7.020 percent
from 7.080 percent.
   Exchange dealers attributed the dollar's early retreat Monday to
its downswing in New York Friday, due partly to U.S. government
reports indicating the nation's economy remains slow and
inflationary pressures had been curbed.
   A U.S. Labor Department report, released Friday, showed an
unexpected 0.3 percent decline in April U.S. wholesale prices,
coupled with a 0.6 percent decline in retail sales during the
month. Both figures accelerated the dollar's decline.
   But in subsequent morning trading, buy orders for the dollar
appeared and it rebounded into the 153 yen range, said Toru Kanai,
exchange analyst for New Japan Securities Co.
   Despite the dollar's continuous fall at the end of last week,
the demand for the U.S. currency remained unexpectedly high, Kanai
commented.
   ``It is not so much that we are seeing a real decline in the
dollar, but rather a long-term adjustment,'' he said.
   An analyst for Japan's largest securities company, Nomura
Securities, said the decline in interest rates abroad, the rise in
domestic bond prices and the rapid fall of the dollar led to the
recent rises in stock prices.
   Stock prices were increasing all across the board Monday
morning, though shares keyed to local demand attracted particular
buyer interest, the analyst said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The main reason for the bullishess of the Tokyo market was that
``fears of inflation in the United States and Europe have faded
into the distance,'' he said.

Assassination Attempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II marked the ninth
anniversary of an attempt on his life and urged residents of this
thriving Dutch Caribbean island to shun materialism, as he
concluded the 47th foreign trip of his papacy.
   The pontiff stopped in Curacao, about 35 miles north of
Venezuela, on Sunday on his way back to Rome after an eight-day,
10-city tour of Mexico.
   Celebrating Mass in a sports stadium, John Paul struck familiar
themes, speaking out against divorce, cohabitation and abortion.
   He earlier made a brief reference to the 1981 assassination
attempt that nearly ended his life in St. Peter's Square. He noted
in a Mexico City airport address that the church was celebrating
the Feast of the Virgin of Fatima on May 13.
   ``(It is) a very significant date for me because on a day like
today nine years ago I felt in a particular way the maternal
protection of Mary,'' the pope told hundreds of people seeing him
off at the end of his second trip to Mexico.
   In Curacao, he urged residents to set a Christian example to the
thousands of tourists who visit every year, and warned against
materialism.
   ``The person, the family and the society will not be fully human
if they limit their aspirations just to possessing, consuming and
enjoying,'' the pontiff said.
   Curacao, a financial and tourism center, has one of the highest
standards of living in the Caribbean. With a population of 147,000,
it is the most populous of the five islands that make up the
autonomous Netherlands Antilles chain.
   Several Latin American clerics, including Cardinal Miguel Obando
y Bravo of Nicaragua, traveled to Curacao to celebrate Mass with
the pope.
   The stadium, with a capacity of 20,000, was about half full.
Behind the altar was a yellow backdrop representing the gabled
colonial buildings of downtown Willemstad, the capital of the
Netherland Antilles.
   The pope received a warm welcome at the airport in this
overwhelmingly Catholic island. A group of schoolgirls in white
blouses and blue skirts sang calypso music and shook pompons of
yellow and white, the Vatican's colors.
   Scattered knots of people, some waving palm fronds, greeted the
pope along his motorcade route. Billboards read ``Bon Bini,'' or
``Welcome'' in the local Papamiento language.
   John Paul's eight-hour stop in Curacao also included meetings
with the prime minister of the Netherland Antilles, Maria
Liberia-Peters, who is Catholic, non-Catholic leaders and priests
and nuns, as well as the Mass.
   The pontiff wound up staying on the island about an hour longer
than the scheduled seven hours, spending more time than allotted to
mingle with crowds. His plane left for Rome at 11:12 p.m. EDT
Sunday and was expected to arrive in the Italian capital this
afternoon.
   John Paul, who turns 70 Friday, barely showed strain during his
visit to Mexico.
   The Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli,
remarked on the assassination anniversary as the pope's special
Aeromexico jet left Mexico City on its way to Curacao.
   ``Nine years ago at this precise moment, there occurred one of
the most incredible manifestations of hate against he who only
preached love,'' he said over the airplane's intercom at 9:17 a.m.
(11:17 a.m. EDT).
   ``But at the same time, there occurred a manifestation of the
intervention of providence,'' Casaroli said. ``Providence not only
saved the life of the pope, but, in a certain sense, reinvigorated
him.''
   The pope was shot as he circled in an open car through the crowd
at his weekly general audience. A Turk, Mehmet Ali Agca, was
convicted of the attempted assassination.
   Since he recovered, John Paul has traveled 400,000 miles in more
than 80 countries.

<HEAD>Police Uncover Intricate Male Prostitution Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy computer expert ran a vast, 39-state
male prostitution ring that recruited ``well-built guys'' through
an electronic network, authorities said.
   The ring, advertising in gay magazines, drew clients that
included a priest and a policeman, authorities said Sunday. Police
estimate at least 50 prostitutes and 300 patrons are involved, but
no identities were disclosed and no arrests made.
   The ring was organized by James William Dayton, 44, a computer
scientist at the Naval Avionics Center in Indianapolis who died of
March 16 after suffering a heart attack at a Tiffin, Ohio, bed and
breakfast, authorities said. He had been having sex with a man who
wanted to join the network as a prostitute, police said.
   Diana Hogue, spokeswoman for the Naval Avionics Center, said
there is no indication Dayton used computers at his job for the
prostitution ring or that anyone else at the center was involved.
   The center acquires and produces advanced electronics systems
for the Naval Air Systems command. Dayton did not have access to
classified data, she said.
   Dayton's setup began to unravel after a sheriff's detective who
investigated his death searched his car and found 140 pages of
computer-generated job applications and photos of nude men,
authorities said.
   Investigators found evidence of an intricate, computerized
system for matching clients with prostitutes across the country, in
two Canadian provinces, in Guam and in Korea.
   Don Smith, a computer expert at Indiana University-Purdue
University at Indianapolis, helped police break the codes to gain
access to that network.
   Smith determined that Dayton had used the computer sign-on Blue
Boy and was the owner-operator of Muscles USA and Muscles Midwest.
   ``I've asked police to go after the most prolific prostitutes as
targets now. We're going to start with the most active ones and we
will ask the patrons to cooperate,'' said Marion County Prosecutor
Stephen Goldsmith.
   He said authorities will try to arrange for AIDS testing of the
patrons.
   The investigation began in 1985 but hit many dead-ends, said
Andrew Stoner, a police spokesman. ``It had built-in barriers that
prevented undercover officers from infiltrating the system,'' he
said.

   Your highway dollars are at work in
Washington, but they're not necessarily building roads and bridges.
   More people are complaining that the dollars coming from the
9.1-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax and other user fees are
maintaining a rickety budget machine instead.
   On Capitol Hill, the Bush administration and congressional
analysts are trying to explain why more available highway money
isn't being spent for its intended purposes.
   ``Our roads and highways are victims of a highway mistrust
fund,'' Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., charged at a hearing last week.
   Fellow Senate Nevadan, Democrat Richard H. Bryan, has introduced
legislation that would require $3 billion extra in projects to be
approved in each of the next three years.
   The highway account of the Federal Highway Trust fund takes in
between $13 billion and $14 billion a year from the gasoline tax, a
15-cent-per-gallon diesel fuel tax and other user fees. Part of the
fund is used for mass transit projects.
   Spending from the highway or similar funds, such as for
aviation, counts in figuring the federal deficit. Likewise,
revenues count against it.
   Rep. Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, has introduced a bill that would remove
the highway fund from overall budget calculations.
   The fund began with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, which
created the nation's interstate highways. The law specified that
the 75 percent to 90 percent federal share of the state-run
projects be financed by the so-called highway user fees.
   Congressional public works committees and the Department of
Transportation authorizes projects. DOT's Federal Highway
Administration apportions the so-called contract authority yearly
under a formula. This authority has a dollar amount.
   But at the same time the spending committees grant obligation
authority, which tells the states how much they can really commit
themselves to spend. States pay the bills for projects then ask the
federal government for reimbursement, so there is a lag between
when a project is authorized and when the federal check comes in
the mail.
   As a result of efforts to regulate outlays, the administration
and then later Congress put ceilings on obligations. An unused cash
balance of $11 billion built up and has remained at that level for
years.
   Both the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget
Office say about $7 billion to $8 billion of that balance could be
committed this year, based on projected income to the account.
   GAO, the auditing arm of Congress, adds that $3.4 billion would
be a more reasonable amount, with the remainder set aside for a
rainy day.
   But a real problem is interest.
   The unspent balances earn about $1 billion a year in interest,
the result of the Treasury borrowing against the account. The fund
has accumulated $15.6 billion in interest since 1956. The
Transportation Department says $4.7 billion of that interest has
been spent. The remaining $11 billion equals the cash balance.
   ``If spending is increased to use more of the interest that is
accruing, the Treasury will have to pay the resulting bills,'' Kate
L. Moore, an assistant Transportation secretary, testified last
week.
   The administration's 1991 budget proposal calls for spending
$300 million of the $900 million in interest credited to the
highway account. Future interest spending has yet to be proposed.

<HEAD>Deadly Bomb Attack Angers Residents of Working Class Neighborhood</HEAD>

   The rubble has been swept away from a
working-class neighborhood after a car bomb killed 15 people. But
the anger remains among residents who blame both drug traffickers
and the United States for the carnage wracking their country.
   Stunned residents coul not understand why their neighborhood had
suddenly become a target.
   ``It's an evil group of people who would attack poor people for
no reason,'' said Luis Benavides, a glass worker whose small
two-story house in the Quirigua neighborhood was severely damaged
by the bomb.
   ``How can we try to understand such madness? Whoever they are,
they are attacking our families and our children in the middle of
the street,'' said Benavides, who shares the house with several of
his 11 children and 12 grandchildren.
   Police blamed drug traffickers for the Quirigua car bomb attack
and two others on Saturday that killed 27 people, including six
children, and wounded some 200.
   The death toll was the highest this year for a single day of
terrorist attacks, police said.
   Two of the attacks came in the capital of Bogota, in Quirigua
and the upper-middle-class enclave of Niza, and the third in the
southern city of Cali. Police said the cars were packed with
dynamite, and the explosions triggered by remote control.
   On Sunday, scores of police officers stood guard in Quirigua
against looters. Hundreds of curious onlookers stood behind ropes
stretched across both ends of a commercial street by police to
cordon off the bomb scene.
   Martha Lucia Sanchez, a 19-year-old student and neighbor of
Benavides, said the car bomb exploded when the streets were full of
people shopping for Mother's Day.
   ``The terrorists did not just want to cause damage to
property.'' she said. ``They wanted to kill as many of the innocent
as they could. They were very determined.''
   Police said 15 people were killed in the Quirigua bomb attack.
Two more people died in Niza and 10 were killed in Cali.
   Benavides' 26-year-old son, Jose Luis, said he was standing by a
front window of his family's home when the bomb exploded.
   On Sunday, he stood by the empty frame of the same window, still
dazed and wearing a blood-stained bandage around his head.
   Jose Luis said he didn't want to stay in a damaged house without
windows, but had no choice.
   ``If we don't stay here we will be robbed,'' he said.
   His wife, Carmen Rosa, shuddered and cried as she told how the
family was planning to celebrate its 18th anniversary of living in
the house at the end of May.
   ``We have been humble persons all our lives,'' she said. ``The
fight between politicians and criminals has nothing to do with us.''
   But many Quirigua residents were more precise in singling out
targets for their rage.
   ``This is the fault of the United States for forcing Colombia to
fight its war against drug traffickers,'' said 34-year-old Miguel
Angel Ayure.
   He angrily blasted President Virgilio Barco and other Colombian
government officials as ``cowards for not resisting the pressure of
the gringos to extradite drug suspects'' to the United States.
   ``I want the death penalty for the drug terrorists who did
this,'' he said. ``But I want them to die in Colombia.''
   Ernesto Aguacida, 34, said Colombia was not only at the mercy of
drug traffickers, but also of foreign governments.
   He noted that drug traffickers are using weapons made in the
United States and Israel.
   ``Those countries profit from this violence,'' he said.
   Aguacida and others predicted that regardless of who wins the
May 27 presidential election and succeeds Barco, the violence will
continue.
   In August, the government announced an offensive against the
drug traffickers following the assassination of presidential
candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   The drug cartels responded with an offensive of their own.
Police blame them for hundreds of bobings and other attacks that
have left nearly 300 people dead.

   A couple who hours earlier had promised to love
each other for richer or for poorer were robbed at gunpoint of
$13,000 in wedding gifts.
   Four robbers in ski masks even took the bridal bouquet and the
top of the wedding cake, police and family members said.
   The newlyweds, Diane and Anthony Rohr, left their wedding
reception early Sunday and stopped for a light in Brooklyn when
another car cut them off and two armed men got out and demanded
money, said police Sgt. Diane Kubler.
   The bride, still in her gown, and the groom, in a tuxedo, were
pulled from the car with the groom's brother and his wife, and the
new Mrs. Rohr was thrown to the ground.
   ``Can you imagine, 10 minutes after your wedding, lying on the
middle of the street with guns pointed everywhere?'' said Rosalie
Williams, the mother of the bride.
   Four men took the wedding gifts, which included cash and checks,
and the car.
   The shaken Rohrs went on their Caribbean honeymoon anyway.
   ``I made them go,'' said the groom's father, William. ``I told
them, `The thieves got everything material. They may have gotten
the car and the money, but you still have each other and that's
what counts.'''

<HEAD>Albanian Communist Leader Rejects Western-Style Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albanian Communist leaders say their
country will continue its cautious course of reform, but they still
reject Western-style politics.
   ``I think it would be absurd to recommend the French or English
model of democracy in another country,'' Albanian Communist Party
leader Ramiz Alia said in comments made available Sunday.
   ``The English Parliament is hundreds of years old, ours not even
50,'' Albania's state ATA news agency quoted Alia as telling U.N.
Secretary General Javier Perez De Cuellar.
   The visit by Perez De Cuellar, who arrived Friday, was the
latest sign that Eastern Europe's last hard-line Communist nation
is emerging from its decades-long policy of isolation.
   At last week's parliament session, Albanian officials eased
restrictions on travel abroad _ difficult if not impossible for
decades for ordinary Albanians _and abolished the death penalty for
those caught trying to flee the country.
   They also said penalties would be lifted for spreading religious
or anti-socialist propaganda.
   But these reforms fall far short of the sweeping changes being
introduced elsewhere in Eastern Europe, where multiparty
democracies are being established.
   The Albanian Communist Party continues to exert its control in a
manner reminiscent of the repressive Stalinist era of the 1940s and
1950s in the Soviet bloc.
   Perez De Cuellar, who has attempted to emphasize the positive
aspects of what remains a restrictive society, on Sunday praised
the cautious changes being introduced in Albania.
   ``I am convinced that this process will be further promoted and
it will lead the country towards a modern society,'' he said at a
reception given in his honor by Alia.
   Albanian officials have suggested that the changes have been
made possible by the relaxation off East-West tensions.
   Prime Minister Adil Carcani touched on that theme at a meeting
Saturday with Perez de Cuellar, who is the first U.N.
secretary-general to visit Albania.
   ``In the future too, the Albanian government will make other
changes in accordance with the conditions of the country's
development and with the international circumstances,'' ATA quoted
Carcani as saying.

   Managers handled operator-assistance calls and
took over other duties after 3,000 union members went on strike
against Cincinnati Bell.
   The union, representing operators, clerical workers and
installers, walked out on Mother's Day, one of the busiest calling
days of the year, after a 14-hour bargaining session broke down
early Sunday. No new talks were scheduled.
   Company spokeswoman Cyndy Cantoni said direct calls are
automated and weren't affected, and people making long distance
calls on Mother's Day saw no difference because Cincinnati Bell is
not a long distance carrier.
   Ms. Cantoni said 1,000 management workers were called in to fill
in for the strikers, and some will put in 12-hour shifts for the
duration of the strike.
   The company serves more than 500,000 customers in the Cincinnati
area and portions of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana.
   ``I don't think customers will see a big difference in most
services, but they can expect slower response time from repair and
installation,'' she said.
   Union leaders said workers went on strike over health benefits
and a plan that would require workers to pay part of their health
premiums.
   Cincinnati Bell workers last struck in 1983. Managers replaced
union workers during the two-week walkout.

<TEXT>
   Few Romanians knew who Petre Roman was
before the December revolution. Now tens of thousands mob him like
a rock star on his swings around the country campaigning for the
May 20 elections.
   Thousands of people protest daily in Bucharest and some other
cities, accusing the governing National Salvation Front of planning
to install a new Communist government. The Front took over when
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown and executed.
   In the towns and countryside, the government and its leaders are
much more popular.
   At Birlad, 160 miles northeast of Bucharest, the crowd of 20,000
pressed so close that Roman ordered his driver to speed away. His
spokesman was spreadeagled on the back of the vehicle, desperately
clutching the antenna.
   After the campaign tour last week, the 43-year-old premier
predicted the Front would win Romania's first free elections in 50
years.
   He, interim President Ion Iliescu and many other Front members
are former officials of the Ceausescu regime who fell out with the
dictator. Roman said in an interview that critics were ``partly
justified'' in suspecting them of being ``neo-Communists.''
   ``We lived 50 years under dictatorship, so the suspicion for
some of them may be sincere,'' the premier said in an interview
aboart his campaign plane.
   Opposition claims that the Front seeks to restore Marxist-style
government should not be taken seriously, he said.
   ``If you assume that the 4 million members of the party were
really Communists, you are wrong,'' Roman said of Communist Party
membership under Ceausescu. ``Many even at the middle level were in
reality fighting to preserve human rights, at risk to themselves.''
   International attention has focused on mass protest against the
Front and Roman's government that began April 22 in downtown
Bucharest, and on opposition accusations that the Front is using
unfair tactics in the campaign.
   The United States recalled its ambassador for consultations May
10.
   At times, 10,000 people have been involved in the Bucharest
protest. Similar demonstrations have been reported in Brasov,
Romania's second-largest city, and Timisoara, where the uprising
against Ceausescu began.
   Roman, a professor of hydraulic engineering before the
revolution, said he expects the Front to win a majority in the new
parliament and Iliescu to be chosen as president.
   Tens of thousands of people have attended campaign rallies for
the two men outside Bucharest, chanting slogans for the Front.
   Whether to accept people with Communist backgrounds into the new
governments being debated throughout the former Soviet bloc. The
debate has all but paralyzed society in Romania, where many in the
opposition feel the ideals of the revolution are being betrayed.
   The Front, a loose assocation of technocrats, intellectuals and
Communists opposed to Ceausescu, seized power by proclamation just
after the dictator tried to flee Dec. 22. He was executed three
days later.
   Under pressure from opposition parties and street demonstrators,
the Front agreed in January to share power in a provisional
legislature, whose enactments included a new election law.
   Opponents accuse the Front of failing to dismiss former members
of Ceausescu's dreaded Securitate secret police from key positions
in ministerial bureaucracies.
   Roman said there were ``no more than 1,000 Communists in the
country'' at the time of the revolution. ``Communism is dead in all
of eastern Europe,'' he said. ``It brought no benefits _ not
economic, not social, not even moral.''
   The prime minister's father, Walter Roman, was among the few
genuine Communists in Romania before World War II and fought in the
Spanish civil war, where he met and married Petre's mother,
Hortensia.
   Petre Roman's relative obscurity before becoming premier, his
Communist background and reluctance to endorse free-market
economics have contributed to suspicions about his plans.
   In the interview, Roman said choices are limited in Romania's
shattered economy, which has little chance of providing better
living standards soon.
   ``I am not for savage liberalism,'' he said. ``I favor a
transition to a market ... with an important social protection
program such as in France, Sweden, but within the limits of an
economy that is profitable for a free- market point of view.''

<HEAD>Female Midshipman Resigns After Being Handcuffed to Urinal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female midshipman was dragged from her
dormitory room, handcuffed to a urinal and taunted by male
midshipmen in what Naval Academy officials said was a
``good-natured exchange'' that got out of hand.
   Gwen Marie Dreyer resigned after the December incident, and the
midshipmen involved were punished with demerits and a loss of leave
time.
   ``We still don't believe that they understand that it was in
fact an assault,'' said Carolyn A. Dreyer, her stepmother. ``An
assault. And it would have been treated that way in any other
school, in any other situation.''
   But academy officials ruled that the incident began as a
friendly encounter that got out of hand after a snowball fight and
therefore couldn't be considered premeditated hazing, which can
lead to dismissal.
   ``We take this kind of thing extremely seriously,'' said Academy
Superintendent Virgil L. Hill Jr. ``Admittedly the incident grew
out of a good-natured exchange between friends. None of that takes
away from the fact that they overstepped bounds and her end feeling
was humiliation. That's sexual harassment. We don't allow that.''
   Dreyer, who was photographed while handcuffed to the urinal, was
eventually freed by her roommates.
   In her letter of resignation last month, Dreyer said resentment
expressed toward women at the academy crushes their spirits.
   ``I understand that steps are now being taken to correct some
very serious human relations problems,'' she wrote. ``However,
after what I've been through and have seen, not only because of
what has happened to me personally, I have decided to leave.''
   She plans to study engineering at California State Polytechnic
Institute in San Luis Obispo.
   Two midshipmen were punished with demerits and loss of leave
time. Six other midshipmen received written warnings for lesser
roles in the incident.
   Hill said the incident was an isolated one, but Dreyer's father
and another academy graduate said it shows the academy still has
not resolved resentment of women at the academy, which first
allowed women in 1976.
   About 10 percent of the 4,000 midshipmen at the academy are
women.
   ``Something needs to be done to change the attitudes of the
macho guys who just don't want women at that school,'' said Gregory
Dreyer, a 1967 academy graduate.
   Hill said attitudes take a long time to change, but his
administration has made strides toward complete assimilation of
women. ``There are problems, I won't deny that,'' Hill said. ``But
in the overall, the system works.''
   Lt. Barbette Lowndes, a 1980 academy graduate polling women in
the military, disagreed.
   ``There still are large cliques of men who want to make it a
men's school again,'' she said. ``They ignore you, keep you
isolated, just let you know that you're not wanted. It's more
mental abuse.''
   Gregory Dreyer said his daughter was intimidated by classmates
who warned her not to testify at a disciplinary hearing. ``She was
told her life would be made miserable,'' he said.
   A 1987 study found that about 35 percent of the women enrolled
at Annapolis eventually left, compared with 22 percent for men. The
gap was the widest of any at the three major military academies.

   Blacks and whites mingled at Peach
County High School's first integrated prom, and many of the nearly
200 students said the change was long overdue.
   ``Somebody is going to come along every time and break some
tradition that's really stupid, some tradition you don't really
think about because you've always done it,'' said Hope Bickley, a
white 17-year-old at the dance Saturday. ``I'm glad it was our
class that broke it.''
   Ato Crumbly, a black student, agreed. ``We go to school
together, play football together, run track together, so why can't
we socialize together?'' Crumbly said Saturday at the formal dance
in the school gym.
   All school dances and parties were canceled by the school board
in the early 1960s when a student apparently was injured during a
prom. Board members also said planning the dances took time away
from schoolwork.
   Nearly 20 years ago, the school was desegregated. But without a
school-sponsored prom, parents began organizing their own _ one for
blacks, one for whites.
   ``I go out of town a lot in the summer, to Las Vegas and
California,'' Crumbly said. ``I'd tell about the prom and they'd
say `What?' And they'd ask, `Do y'all still have to drink out of
separate fountains?''
   Three years ago, Peach County's parent-teacher group tried to
change the board's policy. The board rejected the group's request
for a school-sponsored prom.
   Last year, the board changed its position, and Saturday's
integrated prom was held without incident.
   Susan Jordan, president of the parent-teacher group, said the
students set an example for the community.
   ``A child shall lead them,'' she said. ``Well, in this case, a
group of children shall perhaps lead the community, and won't that
be great? And isn't it about time?''

<TEXT>
   Researchers at the University of Chicago have
found many things over the years _ the speed of light, the
controlled nuclear chain reaction and the treasures of ancient
Persepolis.
   Over the weekend, about 1,300 young scholars sought ``finds'' of
a different kind in the school's fourth annual Scavenger Hunt.
   The students came up with items ranging from ``1,000 points of
light'' to human bologna sandwiches.
   The hunt determined ``how low people would go,'' said Steve
Kornya, a senior from Huntsville, Ala. ``When it comes to crunch
time and you need points, is somebody willing to smear himself with
a couple quarts of condiments and lunch meat?''
   At least eight students were willing. They wrapped themselves in
five loaves of bread, 16 ounces of mayonnaise, an 8-ounce jar of
mustard and a pound or so of bologna each.
   Students had 72 hours, from Thursday to Sunday, to assemble the
objects, performances and answers to questions on the 303-item list.
   An item asking for ``your mother wearing combat boots (with
ID)'' produced one mother, by plane, from Minnesota, said Michael
Sherman, a junior from Albany, N.Y.
   Many fulfilled the 1,000 points of light requirement by
puncturing holes in a piece of paper and shining a light bulb
behind it.
   The $500 first prize was shared by a group of 40 dormitory
students, one of whom had stripped and wore a skirt made of yellow
Post-it notes stuck together.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against key Europen currencies
today but continued to slip against the yen. Gold rose in thin
trading.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 153.35 yen, down 0.80 yen from
its finish Friday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 153.25
yen.
   Dealers said the dollar's level was due partly to U.S.
government reports indicating inflationary pressures had been
curbed. Inflation tends to push up interest rates, making the
dollar more attractive to investors.
   Buy orders for the dollar appeared in today's trading, but the
upswing did not affect the dollar's overall downward trend, said
Masato Nakamura, a currency dealer for Sumitomo Bank.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
   _ 1.6434 West German marks, up from 1.6300
   _ 1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3955
   _ 5.5390 French francs, up from 5.5096
   _ 1.8478 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8330
   _ 1,210.00 Italian lire, up from 1,200.40
   _ 1.1770 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1783
   The British pound traded at $1.6797, down from $1.6817 late
Friday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $368.30 an
ounce today, from $369.05 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, gold opened at a bid of $367.20, down from $368.80
bid late Friday.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $369.10 an ounce, down 97 cents
from Saturday.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.06 an
ounce, unchanged from late Friday.

<HEAD>U.S. and Iran Sign $105 Million Settlement Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABNER KATZMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Iran have
signed a $105 million settlement of some 3,000 financial claims,
bringing the two countries one step closer to re-establishing
economic relations, a U.S. official said today.
   The settlement deals primarily with so-called ``Small Claims''
for under $250,000 that stem from the 1979 Islamic revolution, said
the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It clears the way for the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal to
deal with about $16 billion in major claims, whose resolution in
turn could open the way to normalizing economic ties between the
two nations, the official said.
   The settlement accord was signed late Sunday night or early this
morning by Timothy Ramish, U.S. agent to the tribunal, and Iranian
Agent Ali Nobari, according to the American official at the
tribunal.
   The most recent settlement talks between U.S. and Iranian
officials occurred shortly after the release of American hostages
Frank Reed and Robert Polhill by pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon.
   But U.S. and Iranian representatives to the tribunal have
repeatedly stated the talks dealt only with financial arbitration
and not with the six remaining Americans still in captivity in
Lebanon.
   Last week a U.S. State Department official in Washington, who
commented on condition of anonymity, said he could not predict
whether resolving its financial disputes will result in the release
of remaining hostages or was in any way related to the release of
Polhill and Reed.
   The Small Claims package dealt primarily with Americans who left
behind personal possessions or were owed salaries by Iranian
companies when they fled Iran during the revolution. They were
settled for a total of $50 million.
   The settlement also provided $55 million for repayment of a loan
from the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   The tribunal was set up as part of the Algiers Accord of 1980,
which resulted in freedom for the American hostages held by Iranian
militants at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days. The tribunal
has three Iranian, three American and three third-nation
arbitrators.
   The biggest claim still before the tribunal, valued at up to $11
billion by Iran, is for military equipment which Iran ordered but
did not receive as a result of the embargo imposed by the U.S.
government.
   After the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979, Iran
canceled contracts for $9 billion worth of weaponry, including four
destroyers under construction that were later taken over by the
U.S. Navy.
   Remaining major claims, totaling about $5 billion, were filed by
American oil companies for property and operations expropiated by
the Iranian government, as well as for broken contracts.

<HEAD>Government Promises Jobs, Kashmiris Demand Freedom</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANANTNAG, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's top troubleshooter
handling the Moslem secessionist movement came to Kashmir over the
weekend offering jobs. But his audience demanded nothing less than
freedom from Indian rule.
   The chasm between the people of Kashmir and the central
government in New Delhi cannot be easily bridged today.
   Now, four decades of pent-up feelings among Kashmir's Moslem
majority have finally exploded into a bloody separatist movement
for an Islamic state.
   George Fernandes, minister for Kashmiri affairs in the
6-month-old government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh, spoke
earnestly of the need to right economic wrongs to pacify a people
whose sentiments he says have been hijacked by a few radical
separatists.
   But the men and women who crowded around him Saturday in the
city of Anantnag weren't interested in economics.
   Sometimes angrily, sometimes tearfully, they demanded the
release of sons and husbands detained by Indian security forces on
suspicion of belonging to militant groups that kill government
employees, military men and suspected informers.
   The deployment of tens of thousands of security troops and the
arrests of hundreds of people have galvanized the public as never
before against what Kashmiri Moslems now routinely describe as
``Indian occupation.''
   In Anantnag and Srinagar, summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state
and heart of the secessionist movement, men and women, without
bidding, pull up sleeves and tunics to reveal deep bruises, gashes
and sometimes bullet wounds they say were inflicted by Indian
security forces.
   When Fernandes arrived in Anantnag, 34 miles southeast of
Srinagar Saturday, about 100 men, women and children greeted him
with a chant: ``What do we want? We want freedom.''
   Fernandes, a silver-haired socialist and former labor leader,
settled into a chair in front of the government guesthouse and
began hearing grievances in an effort to persuade Kashmiris that
the Indian government cares about them.
   A young woman, concealed by a black Islamic veil from the top of
her head to the knees of her baggy pantaloons, said one of her
brothers had been taken away by security troops and a second had
gone into hiding for fear he, too, would be arrested. ``We will
take up guns here,'' she cried.
   Stories tumbled over each other in a cacophony of complaints
against the Indian army and the paramilitary Central Reserve Police
Force which have been deployed in Kashmir since the government's
latest _ and harshest _ crackdown started Jan. 20. At least 368
people have been killed so far.
   ``At midnight they came and my son was taken naked,'' said Raja
Begum. ``His was the only earning hand in my family. I have had
four operations and cannot even work in the fields.''
   She said her son, Kurshid Ahmad, was detained 10 days ago and
she still had no word of his whereabouts.
   It is impossible to say which accounts are accurate. Anantnag
has long been a bulwark of support for the separatists and is the
home of one of their top leaders, Shabir Shah, jailed since March.
   Fernandes, who has made a half-dozen trips to Kashmir in the
past four months, said he believed that by offering jobs the
government could regain the support of the majority of people in
this scenic valley.
   Tourism has long been the economic mainstay of Kashmir, but the
tourist trade has all but vanished due to the unrest.
   Asked about allegations of brutality, Fernandes said: ``I don't
blame the security forces. In this sort of situation, many things
can happen.''
   The Kashmir conflict stems from the region's division along a
still-disputed frontier between India and predominantly Moslem
Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned along religious
lines in gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
   Kashmir was mainly Moslem, but its Hindu ruler opted to join
India instead of Pakistan. The two countries went to war over
Kashmir in 1948 and 1965.
   Today, the Indian-governed part of Kashmir is incorporated into
the state of Jammu-Kashmir, the only one in India with a Moslem
majority. Sixty-four percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people
are Moslems, but nationwide Moslems account for only 12 percent of
India's 880 million population.

<HEAD>Baby Sitter Suspect in Boy's Death and Sex Attacks of Three Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITCHFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partially blind baby sitter stabbed
himself in the stomach after killing an 11-year-old boy and
sexually assaulting three girls, authorities said.
   Lenard Johnson, 37, was hospitalized under police guard Sunday
in serious condition with an apparent self-inflicted knife wound to
the stomach and cuts to his wrist and head, said Lt. David Andrews
of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Department.
   Montgomery County State's Attorney Kathryn Dobrinic said she has
not determined what charges to file against Johnson, but she is
``certain they will include a first-degree murder charge.'' She
said in a telephone interview that prosecutors may seek the death
penalty.
   The slain boy, Donald L. Buske, was stabbed twice in the neck in
the attack early Saturday morning, said Montgomery County Coroner
Rick Broaddus.
   Reports conflicted about whether the girls _ ages 7, 11 and 13 _
remained at St. Francis Hospital for observation or had been
released. Nursing supervisor Vicki Holzhausen referred all calls to
the state's attorney's office early today.
   The boy and the 7-year-old girl were siblings, and the two other
girls had been visiting them for the night.
   Johnson lived two blocks from the house where the attacks
occurred, said Dobrinic.
   The incident began Friday night after the Buske children's
mother, Susan Emerson, and her husband, James, went out for the
night, leaving the children with Johnson.
   When James Emerson later took Johnson back to his own home,
Susan Emerson's 7-year-old daughter told her mother that she had
been assaulted, authorities said. The Emersons took the girl to St.
Francis Hospital, instructing the remaining children to lock the
house and admit no one, according to police.
   After the parents left, Johnson sneaked back to the house, tore
open a screen and lifed a front window to enter, authorities said.
   Once inside, Johnson allegedly killed the boy, then assaulted
the two girls, isolating himself in the bathroom with them briefly
after police arrived.
   When the standoff ended about 15 minutes later, police said they
found Johnson suffering from stab wounds to the abdomen, neck and
wrists.

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion Gov. Robert P. Casey faces
a pro-choice lawyer Tuesday in a Democratic primary hinged largely
on one issue _ abortion.
   Casey's Democratic primary opponent, Philip Berg, has spent
$35,000 on radio advertising focused on the incumbent's opposition
to abortion rights.
   ``I believe that this primary election will be decided by voters
who will choose to reaffirm individual rights,'' Berg said.
   ``By spending money to help voters identify the one candidate
who holds those rights sacred, I am affirming the right of all
Americans to have the right to choose,'' he said.
   Casey, 58, and his running mate, incumbent Lt. Gov. Mark Singel,
36, prefer to dwell on his administration's efforts to battle
drugs, boost economic development and clean up the environment.
   Casey was first elected in 1986 after three unsuccessful runs
for governor and is seeking a second term. Berg, 45, a former
Democratic Party chairman in Montgomery County, is running with
Edward Mezvinsky, 53, a former state party chairman.
   State Auditor General Barbara Hafer and Marguerite Luksik are
running for governor in the Republican primary.
   Hafer, 46, is running as a pro-choice Republican. She has aimed
her campaign at Casey. Mrs. Luksik, 34, opposes abortion rights.
   Mrs. Luksik, a homemaker and executive director of Mom's House,
a child care center with tutoring and counseling for single parents
who return to school, has focused her campaign on abortion.
   Karen Chandler, a campaign spokeswoman for Casey, said the
governor's accomplishments have not been outshined by the hammering
on abortion.
   ``We've seen no indication throughout the campaign that the kind
of single-issue hammering being done by Berg and Mezvinsky is
having any kind of effect on people's impressions of what the
governor has accomplished in the last three and a half years,'' she
said.

   Negotiators began talks today on the
future of U.S. military bases in this country, a day after
suspected Communist guerrillas shot and killed two American
servicemen near one of the installations.
   Truncheon-wielding police fired tear gas at hundreds of
anti-base protesters during running confrontations through the
streets of the capital.
   At least 42 people were arrested and five hospitalized,
witnesses and police said. Protesters, mostly students, retaliated
by throwing small homemade bombs at police.
   Rallies were held throughout the day and security was tight for
the talks, which opened at the Central Bank building with about 500
police on hand. Five truckloads of riot police were deployed before
the gate at Clark Air Base as about 400 base opponents rallied in
nearby Angeles City.
   U.S. and Philippine officials had expressed fears that the
Communist New People's Army would try to kill Americans before the
talks on extending the lease on Clark and Subic Bay naval base as
well as four smaller facilities. The lease is set to expire Sept.
16, 1991.
   As the talks opened, the chief U.S. negotiator condemned the
killings of two U.S. airmen near Clark on Sunday and assailed the
``banditry'' of Communist rebels, blamed by authorities for the
attack.
   ``This brutal and clumsy attempt to drive a wedge between the
United States and the Philippines will fail,'' said Richard
Armitage, a former assistant secretary of defense.
   Police Capt. Gener Manguni said it appeared the rebels were
responsible for the killings because of the style of the attack.
Two or three Filipinos approached the Americans and shot them in
the back of their heads with .45-caliber pistols, the rebels'
favored weapon in street killings.
   The dead servicemen were identified by Air Force officials as
Airman John H. Raven, 19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and Airman
James C. Green, 20, of Craig, Colo. A companion, Airman 1st Class
Randall Moore, 23, managed to escape.
   They were among 280 airmen and support personnel assigned to the
8th Aircraft Generation Squadron on temporary duty from Kunsan Air
Base, 110 miles south of Seoul, South Korea.
   Police rounded up more than 200 people for questioning in the
attack but no charges were filed.
   The Navy banned off-post leave for the 40,000 troops, Defense
Department civilians and military dependents at U.S. installations
in the Philippines.
   Eight Americans have died in politically motivated slayings in
the Phillipines since April 1989.
   The rebels made no claim of responsibility for Sunday's
killings. But in a media statement the New People's Army denounced
the bases talks.
   ``The NPA pledges that all its territorial and unit commands,
all officers and men, will carry out their mission to the last man
if necessary, of expelling U.S. imperialism out of our country,''
the statement said.
   In Manila, about 3,000 militant workers gathered in a city
square as speakers denounced the bases. ``Americans must be driven
away,'' Crispin Beltran, chairman of the May First Movement, a
labor federation, told the crowd. ``And those who refuse must be
buried here.''
   Later, the group tried to march to the U.S. Embassy but was
blocked by police. The protesters placed a plywood placard bearing
a base ``eviction notice'' on a traffic island in front of the
embassy.
   President Corazon Aquino told reporters the government was
taking ``all necessary measures'' to protect Americans but ``we
cannot guarantee a 100 percent, fail-safe protection. No government
can.''
   She has refused to say whether she will agree to extend the
lease for the bases, among the largest outside the United States.
   Armitage said the bases help provide stability in the Far East
but that the United States would leave if Filipinos wanted the
installations closed.
   ``If you ask us to leave, leave we shall, as expeditiously as
possible and with our pride fully intact,'' Armitage said. ``If we
do not truly believe that there exists a compelling mutual interest
between the Philippines and the United States, then we have
precious little to discuss other than the terms of an amicable
separation.''
   Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. panel, said security
for Americans would also be high on the agenda during the first
round of talks.
   The Municipal Mayors League of the Philippines today presented
Mrs. Aquino with a copy of a resolution approved last March
endorsing retention of the bases.
   The league said the installations contributed to the nation's
economy as well as regional security.
   But opposition to the bases has been increasing because a
growing number of Filipinos believe they infringe on national
sovereignty. Criticism intensified after Congress cut $96 million
from the Bush administration's request for aid to Manila.
   In 1988, the Reagan administration pledged $962 million over two
years to keep the bases through 1991. Philippine officials consider
the congressional cutbacks a breach of that agreement.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, chief Philippine delegate,
cited the shortfall and urged Washington to provide more aid.
   The talks are considered exploratory. Afterward, the two sides
will decide whether to enter formal negotiations. Any agreement
must be ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member Philippine Senate,
where opposition to the bases is strong.

   Thunderstorms ushered in cool weather in the East and the
north-central United States today after a round of tornadoes in the
Plains and more flooding in the South.
   Rain fell early today in Minneapolis-St. Paul and in Anchorage,
Alaska. Boston had drizzle.
   Louisiana braced for the worst flooding in 45 years and more
flooding was expected in Texas and Arkansas. Heavy weekend rain
worsened the flood threat in Louisiana as the Red River continued
to rise from Shreveport to Alexandria.
   Thunderstorms spawned tornadoes Sunday in Nebraska, Wyoming,
Kansas, Maryland, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
   A tornado caused heavy damage to a shopping center and an
apartment complex in Newberry Township in eastern Pennsylvania. The
National Weather Service also said 12 houses were damaged about 10
miles south of Harrisburg. No injuries were reported.
   Snow was predicted today in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, and
high wind was expected in Arizona.
   Sunday's thunderstorms were scattered in Colorado, Wyoming and
South Dakota and rain extended from Minnesota to Wyoming, where
snow fell in higher elevations.
   The central Gulf Coast, Maryland and parts of Florida and North
Carolina also were hit by thunderstorms Sunday.
   Temperatures early today were in the 40s in portions of the West
and Midwest and in the 50s in parts of New England.
   The nation's high Sunday was 101 degrees in the Texas towns of
Cotulla and Laredo.

   Millions more Americans are exposed to
hurricanes as the population grows in the Southeast and Gulf
states, and meteorologists worry that these new residents may
underestimate the dangers they could face.
   The entire region from Texas to North Carolina has experienced
sharp growth in recent years _ a period that has averaged
relatively few hurricanes.
   That means many coastal residents have never experienced a major
storm.
   Emergency management officials say they fear that when a major
storm does threaten, people will underestimate the danger and delay
evacuation or fail to leave at all.
   ``We are more vulnerable to hurricanes in the United States now
than we have ever been in our history,'' said the American
Meteorological Society in a special statement of concern adopted a
couple of years ago.
   ``It is imperative that coastal residents and visitors alike
take the threat seriously, acquaint themselves with hurricane
safety rules, and evacuate immediately if advised to do so,'' said
Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   As it is, the population in many regions _ such as the New
Orleans area _ now exceeds the number that could be safely
evacuated in the time available, officials said.
   ``Some evacuation times for high-density coastal populations are
much larger than the amount of time that we can reasonably give a
decent warning,'' said meteorologist Miles Lawrence of the
Hurricane Center.
   Florida's Atlantic coast tops the region with 2,075 people per
shoreline mile, up from 824 per mile in 1960, according to a new
study from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   About one-third of the residents in the Southeast region _ from
Texas to North Carolina _ are considered coastal in the NOAA study,
including the entire population of Florida.
   June 1 marks the official start of hurricane season for the
Southeast, and the danger period extends to autumn.
   ``Overall, there have been less hurricanes in the last 20 years
than prior to that,'' noted Lawrence, adding that ``southeast
Florida has not had a direct hit by a Category 3 or higher (storm)
since 1965.''
   Strong storms have struck in recent years in South Carolina and
Texas, however, he said. Hurricanes are graded on a scale of 1 to
5, with 5 the strongest.
   Last year's Hurricane Hugo killed 29 people and did an estimated
$5.9 billion in damage in South Carolina. The storm also inflicted
serious damage on adjacent states as well as the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico. Advance warning, however, allowed people to be
evacuated from many coastal islands and low-lying regions.
   While Hugo is reportedly the most expensive hurricane in U.S.
history, it is far from the deadliest. That occurred in 1900 when a
storm arriving with little warning drove a wall of water over
Galveston, Texas, killing an estimated 6,000 people.
   While Florida's East Coast is the most densely populated area
where hurricanes post the greatest threat, all areas seem to be
growing rapidly.
   Texas' coastal counties average 1,517 people per shore mile, up
from 798 in 1960. Third is Florida's west coast, where the coastal
population has risen from 433 per mile in 1960 to 1,064 currently,
according to NOAA.
   Here is a rundown of the population in coastal states most
threatened by hurricanes. It includes the percentage of the state's
population considered coastal and the estimated number of people
per shoreline mile in 1988 compared with 1960 and the projected
population in the year 2010.
   _Florida (East Coast), 100 percent coastal; 2,075 people per
shoreline mile, up from 824 in 1960, headed for 2,689 in 2010.
   _Florida (Gulf Coast), 100 percent coastal; 1,064 per mile; up
from 433, headed for 1,411.
   _Texas, 31 percent coastal; 1,517 per shoreline mile, up from
798, headed for 1,956.
   _Mississippi, 13 percent coastal; 928 per mile, up from 527,
headed for 1,102.
   _Alabama, 12 percent coastal; 800 per mile, up from 599, headed
for 886.
   _Louisiana, 62 percent coastal; 352 per mile, up from 248,
headed for 420.
   _South Carolina, 25 percent coastal, 303 per mile, up from 176,
headed for 365.
   _North Carolina, 11 percent coastal, 202 per mile, up from 140,
headed for 234.
   _Georgia, 6 percent coastal, 158 per mile, up from 114, headed
for 179.

<HEAD>Three Arrested in Alleged White Supremacist Bomb Plot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three men affiliated with an Idaho
white-supremacist group were arrested hours before they had planned
to stage a bombing attack on minorities or homosexuals, the FBI
sasid.
   Two of the men were arrested in the Seattle area Saturday, FBI
agent Steven Pomerantz said Sunday. The third man was arrested in
Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
   The men were held for investigation of conspiracy, illegal
possession of firearms and possession of an explosive device.
   Pomerantz said the attack was to occur in Seattle ``directed
against either members of a minority group or the homosexual
community.''
   Pomerantz refused to disclose details of the plot or its
intended victims except to say it had been planned to take place
within hours of the time the men were arrested. He said agents made
the arrests before the men were able to assemble the bomb.
   John Winslow, 29, of LaClede, Idaho, and Stephen E. Nelson, 35,
of Hayden Lake, Idaho, were arrested as they emerged from a van.
They were to appear before a U.S. magistrate in Seattle today.
   The third man, James P. Baker, was to appear in court in Idaho.
   The three are associated with the white supremacist group Aryan
Nations, based in Hayden Lake, Pomerantz said. The group, led by
72-year-old founder and pastor Richard Butler, has preached a goal
of white supremacy and has vowed to establish a whites-only
homeland in the Northwest.
   A search of the van turned up a 6-inch pipe, smokeless
gunpowder, a coil of primer fuse, a propane cylinder, a 12-gauge
shotgun, a .38-caliber revolver, a ``stun gun,'' knives, hate
literature and other items, the FBI said.

   A man suspected of killing two policemen sent to
quell a family dispute was arrested early today during a search by
more than 100 officers using dogs, authorities said.
   Roman Chavez, 23, was charged with two counts of murder and one
count of armed robbery, said James Fruin at the Grand Central
police district. Chavez is accused in the late Sunday slayings of
20-year officers Gregory A. Hauser, 43, and Raymond C. Kilroy, 47.
   Chavez was captured about 3 a.m. after a five-hour search in the
northwest side neighborhood where the shootings took place. Police
recovered the weapon believed used in the killings. Fruin said the
revolver belonged to one of the slain officers.
   Police said the officers had answered a complaint of a dispute
between Chavez and his grandmother. The policemen had called for
backup officers and a squadrol, or paddy wagon, said police
Superintendent LeRoy Martin.
   ``When the squadrol got there they found them dead,'' Martin
said. ``It seems that they were hit and knocked off their feet, and
then shot in the head.''
   Kilroy died at Illinois Masonic Hospital of gunshot wounds to
the chest and the back of his head, said a nursing supervisor who
would not give her name.
   Hauser died at Lutheran General Hospital in suburban Park Ridge
from four gunshot wounds, said spokeswoman Laurel Stevens.
   A woman identified as Chavez's grandmother was taken in for
questioning. Her name was withheld.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Dtates Sue Asbestos Manufacturers in High
Court</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let 30
states sue 26 manufacturers in the nation's highest court over
removal of asbestos from public schools and other government
buildings.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
manufacturers should pay for such removal.
   Today's action does not preclude the 30 states from suing
asbestos manufacturers in their respective state courts.
   But the states first went to the justices, hoping to head off a
competition among themselves for monetary damages from the asbestos
makers.
   In an unsual move, the states asked the court to invoke its
``original jurisdiction'' so this big-stakes dispute could be
consolidated and resolved before any lower court considers it.
   The request was denied.
   Asbestos has been used for decades in the construction of
buildings and ships. The inhalation of asbestos fibers has been
linked to various diseases.
   Tens of thousands of personal-injury lawsuits have been filed
against asbestos manufacturers by shipyard workers. Hundreds of
asbestos-in-buildings suits also have been filed.
   The justices were told that eight states have sued asbestos
makers in their state courts, seeking to have them pay the costs of
removing the substance from public buildings.
   The eight states are Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
   In response to the request acted on today, lawyers for one
asbestos maker, W.R. Grace &amp; Co., said, ``There is no national or
even interstate issue involved here. Plaintiffs may turn at any
time to their own state courts as have their eight sister states.''
   Lawyers for the company said the suggestion ``that only this
court can equitably apportion defendants' assets and spare the
states a race to judgment'' wrongly implies a preordained finding
of liability.
   They quoted Environmental Protection Agency reports indicating
that the presence of asbestos in a building does not mean the
health of occupants is endangered if the asbestos-containing
material remains in good condition and is unlikely to be disturbed.
   The states' request was prepared by Attorney General Kenneth
Eikenberry of Washington state.
   The states were Washington, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming.
   New Jersey subsequently asked the court to join the other states
as a plaintiff.
   In addition to W.R. Grace, the named defendants were National
Gypsum, U.S. Gypsum, USG Corp., American Biltrite, Armstrong World
Industries, Azrock Industries, Basic Inc., Carey-Canada, Celotex,
Certainteed Corp., Crown Cork &amp; Seal, Eagle-Pitcher Industries,
Fibreboard Corp., Flintkote, GAF, Georgia-Pacific, H.K. Porter Co.,
Keene Corp., Kentile Floors, Owens-Corning Fiberglass,
Owens-Illinois, Pfizer, Raymark Industries, Sprayed Insulation Inc.
and Turner &amp; Newall.
   The case is Alabama vs. W.R. Grace, 116 Original.

<HEAD>Demjanjuk Appeals Conviction For War Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trial judges who convicted retired Ohio
autoworker John Demjanjuk of killing Jews at a World War II death
camp were biased, his attorney said today in court arguments
appealing the war crimes conviction.
   In April 1988, a three-judge panel found that Demjanjuk was a
brutal guard known as ``Ivan the terrible,'' who operated gas
chambers at the Treblinka death camp in Poland from 1942 to 1943.
More than 850,000 Jews died there.
   Demjanjuk, 70, was sentenced to death under a 1950 Israeli law
allowing prosecution of Nazis and their collaborators.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk has maintained he is a victim of
mistaken identity and that he was incarcerated in German POW camps
during the period in question.
   Speaking before a five-justice Supreme Court panel, Demjanjuk's
Israeli attorney, Yoram Sheftel, said he disputed the conviction on
10 points. The most significant, Sheftel said, was ``the bias of
the court.''
   ``It should lead to the clear conclusion that the conviction
should be canceled and especially in a case where the sentence is
capital punishment,'' he said.
   Sheftel argued at length about what he said was a hostile
atmosphere created by news reports and the judges' treatment of the
defense during the 17-month trial.
   He claimed the trial judges _ Dov Levine, Dalia Dorner and
Shmuel Tal _subscribed to a clipping service that twice daily
delivered reports from newspapers. He also asserted the judges
briefed reporters on occasion.
   He said biased reporting ``clearly had a great deal of influence
on the court. Sometimes I thought I wasn't sitting in a court but
at Bloomfield,'' a football stadium near Tel Aviv, said Sheftel.
   He said there were frequent shouts and interruptions from the
audience at the trial, which was held in a converted movie theater.
   ``Not only was an appearance of justice lacking but justice in
fact was not done,'' said Sheftel.
   He said the judges repeatedly interrupted defense
cross-examinations and intervened frequently in the proceedings.
   Throughout the proceedings, Demjanjuk, wearing a dark brown
prison uniform, listened impassively from a witness stand, guarded
by two policemen. He muttered ``good morning'' in Hebrew as he
entered the courtroom wearing handcuffs and then embraced his son,
John Jr.
   Demjanjuk's wife, Vera, also was present and refused to speak to
reporters.
   Prosecutor Yonah Blattman interrupted Sheftel once in the first
five hours of arguments. Blattman said Sheftel's bases for claiming
bias ``are not legal or factual arguments and are not worthy of
being brought before the court.'
   Chief Justice Meir Shamgar overruled the objection.
   Sheftel also challenged Israel's jurisdiction to try Demjanjuk
as a war criminal.
   He noted Israel's extradition treaty with the United States, and
that the warrant under which Demjanjuk was deported allowed for
trying a suspect on murder charges but not genocide or mass murder.
   Demjanjuk was extradited from his home in Cleveland, Ohio, in
February 1986 after an Ohio court stripped him of his citizenship
for lying about his Nazi past on immigration forms.
   Sheftel said he will argue eight other points in the coming five
weeks of court sessions.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit accusing the Reagan administration of unlawfully bombing
Libya in 1986 with help from Great Britain.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit and also ordered the Libyans and their lawyers _ including
former Attorney General Ramsey Clark _ to pay penalties and the
British government's legal costs.
   The suit first was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson, who said it had ``no hope whatsoever of
success.'' But Jackson did not assess penalties or court costs
because, he said, the suit was not frivolous ``so much as it is
audacious.''
   The government of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher then
asked that it be reimbursed for legal fees and court costs, and the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here agreed.
   The appeals court last September said the Libyans' lawyers must
have known the suit was hopeless but went through with it ``as a
public statement of protest.''
   The appeals court said since the case lacks legal merit, the
Libyans and their attorneys must be penalized under court rules
barring frivolous suits.
   The appeals court ordered them to pay $16,852 in legal fees and
court costs, and sent the case back to Jackson to determine
additional sanctions. Reagan administration officials, including
former President Reagan, previously had dropped an appeal for such
reimbursement and penalties.
   The Libyans' suit charged that the April 15, 1986, bombing raid
violated principles of international law and numerous treaties and
declarations.
   Mrs. Thatcher was sued for approving the use of U.S. military
bases in Britain to launch the attacks.
   The suit said the Reagan administration's real purpose was to
kill Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and to ``terrorize Libyans by
inflicting injury upon the civilian population ... to undermine
support'' for Gadhafi.
   Reagan said the raid was in retaliation for anti-American
attacks authorized by Gadhafi, including the bombing of a West
Berlin discotheque frequented by U.S. servicemen that killed two
and injured 150 others.
   Among the victims of the bombing raid was a 3-month-old girl who
died when hit by shrapnel while asleep in her home in Benghazi. The
child's 38-year-old father was also killed by shrapnel, according
to the suit.
   Clark, attorney general under President Johnson, has been
criticized in the past for dealing with nations hostile to the
United States.
   In 1980 he attended a ``Crimes of America'' conference in Iran
while American hostages were being held in Tehran. In 1972 he went
to Hanoi to investigate the effects of U.S. bombing during the
Vietnam War.
   The case is Saltany vs. Reagan, 89-1497.

   The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by 13
men convicted in the so-called pizza connection drug-trafficking
conspiracy.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the men's
rights were not violated in one of the longest and costliest trials
in U.S. history.
   The 13 were convicted in New York City three years ago after a
17-month trial. They received sentences ranging from four to 45
years in prison.
   The government said the drug ring brought $1.6 billion worth of
heroin and cocaine into the country from Turkey, Sicily and Brazil
through a network of pizza parlors.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions
last October, although it expressed misgivings about the length and
complexity of the trial.
   All told, there were 21 defendants in the case and numerous
charges of conspiracy, racketeering, money laundering and other
offenses on three continents dating back to the 1970s.
   Not all those convicted appealed to the 2nd Circuit court. The
Supreme Court last February rejected a separate appeal by a 14th
defendant, Filippo Casamento, who had been sentenced to 30 years.
   The main defendants included Gaetano Badalamenti, reputed former
head of the Mafia in Sicily, and Salvatore Catalano, the mob's
reputed New York boss. Each received a 45-year sentence.
   Also convicted were Giuseppe Lamberti, 30 years; Salvatore
Greco, Salvatore Lamberti, Frank Castronovo and Salvatore Mazzurco,
20 years each; Giovanni Ligammari, 15 years; Giovanni Cangialosi
and Emanuele Palazzolo, 12 years each; Salvatore Salamone and
Giuseppe Vitale, five years each, and Lorenzo Devardo, four years.
   A 15th defendant, Francesco Polizzi, was sentenced to 20 years
in prison but was not involved in the appeal acted on today.
   In their appeal, the 13 said their jury did not represent a fair
cross-section of the community because it was drawn from people who
were unemployed, retired or who held low-level jobs they could
afford to leave for a long time.
   Moreover, the defendants' lawyers said, ``No jury, given this
trial's length, complexity and subject matter, could have rendered
a reliable verdict.''
   The appeal also argued that the jurors were prejudiced by
violent events outside the courtroom during the trial.
   One defendant was murdered during the proceedings; another was
shot. One juror was excused after her daughter received a
threatening telephone call.
   The case is Palazzolo vs. U.S., 89-1565.

   Business inventories were unchanged in March
after advancing during the two previous three months, the
government reported today, while sales rose 0.6 percent for their
third consecutive gain.
   The Commerce Department said inventories on shelves and backlots
totaled a seasonally adjusted $794.0 billion after rising a revised
0.4 percent in February and 0.3 percent in January. Inventories in
February originally were reported to have fallen 0.4 percent.
   Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $539.1 billion following
gains of 1.4 percent in February and 0.4 percent in January. The
February increase first was reported to have been 1.3 percent.
   The March business activity produced a 1.47 ratio of inventories
to sales, matching a 1.47 ratio in January 1989, which was the
lowest since the current economic expansion began after the 1981-82
recession. The ratio means that it would take 1.47 months to
exhaust inventories at the March pace.
   Rising sales and falling inventories is a sign of economic
strength. If inventories were to rise excessively, it could mean
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs. For instance, the ratio
peaked at 1.70 in October 1982 during the last recession.
   The inventory decline was centered in the manufacturing sector,
where it fell 0.3 percent. Inventories edged up 0.3 percent at the
retail level and 0.2 percent at the wholesale level.
   Sales, on the other hand, dropped 0.2 percent at the retail
level. The Commerce Department reported last Friday that retail
sales fell another 0.6 percent in April, the biggest plunge in six
months.
   Manufacturing sales rose 1.1 percent and wholesale sales
advanced 0.8 percent.

   Police and troops backed by tanks
hurled tear gas and fired in the air today to disperse thousands of
demonstrators who tried to enter the Israeli-occupied West Bank
during a pro-Palestinian march.
   Many teen-agers threw stones at the tanks and police, and
hospital sources said at least 103 people were injured in the
90-minute clash. Later, however, Interior Minister Salem Masadeh
said 52 were injured.
   There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
   Many of the participants in the march collapsed on the ground as
tear gas canisters exploded in the middle of the crowd, estimated
at more than 20,000 people.
   The army and police had told the crowd to stop 700 yards from
the bridge over the Jordan River that leads to the West Bank. But
when the demonstrators arrived after a one-hour walk from Hajjaj
City, three miles to the north, about 2,500 demonstrators tried to
run toward the wooden bridge.
   Some protesters were only two yards away from the bridge when
the policemen began firing their guns into the air and hurling tear
gas.
   ``There was nothing else for us to do,'' said a riot policeman.
``We had to stop them by force. Otherwise, they would have
penetrated into the Israeli side.''
   Some of those injured appeared to have broken limbs, and a few
were bleeding after being trampled in the stampede as hysterical
crowds ran in all directions.
   Shuna Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
most of casualties were unconscious from inhaling tear gas, but
they said there were no gunshot wounds.
   It was not clear if any of the estimated 700 policemen and 300
army soldiers was injured.
   Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan during the 1967 Middle
East war, and a Palestinian uprising against the occupation has
been simmering for 29 months.
   Palestinian flags, portraits of Palestinian figures and
anti-American and anti-Israeli banners the demonstrators had waved
during the march were left lying on the ground.
   The march was organized by 120 Arab unions and profession
associations to mark the 42nd anniversary of the U.N. Partition
Plan that sliced British-mandated Palestine into Jewish and Arab
states.
   The participants included Jordanian citizens, Arab unionists,
Jordanian Parliament members and scores of Palestinians who had
been deported after Israel seized the West Bank.
   Roughly half of Jordan's 3.1 million population come from
Palestinian families who fled or were driven out during the 1948
and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars.
   The demonstrators waved banners that said: ``America is the head
of the snake.'' Other slogans read: ``American is the number one
enemy of the Arabs as it is the strategic ally of the cancerous
Zionist entity.''
   The crowd chanted ``We want an independent Palestine state amd
homes to shelter our childrens,'' as well as Palestinian songs.
   Many waved the four-color Palestinian flag and portraits of
Khalil al-Wazir, deputy commander of the Palestine Liberation
Organization who was killed by an Israeli commando unit in Tunis on
April 16, 1988.

<HEAD>Court Rules Price-Cutting Schemes Do Not Necessarily Violate Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Price-cutting schemes that hurt a competitor's
business do not necessarily violate federal antitrust laws, the
Supreme Court ruled today.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices killed a lawsuit against Atlantic
Richfield Co. (ARCO) by independent gas stations in California and
Washington state.
   The court said that only when a company's price-cutting can be
proved to be ``predatory'' and harmful does it violate the Sherman
Act, a major antitrust law.
   USA Petroleum Co., an independent oil dealer, accused ARCO of
conspiring with ARCO gas station dealers to fix prices illegally to
drive the smaller independents out of business.
   ARCO contended that its plan, lower gasoline prices to attract
more customers and discontinuing credit card sales to save money,
is legitimate.
   ARCO lawyers said the major company's share of the retail gas
market in California and Washington was 10 to 12 percent in 1981
and increased to 14 to 16 percent in 1983 because of lower prices.
   A federal judge threw out the lawsuit, but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated it in 1988.
   The appeals court said that even though there was no proof that
ARCO engaged in predatory pricing, it still may have injured USA
Petroleum in violation of federal antitrust law.
   Predatory pricing is defined as setting prices below the level
necessary to sell a product at a profit or below an appropriate
measure of the cost of producing the product.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice William J. Brennan
said USA Petroleum had not suffered any ``antitrust injury.''
   ``When a firm, or even a group of firms ... lowers prices but
maintains them above predatory levels, the business lost by rivals
cannot be viewed as an anticompetitive consequence,'' Brennan said.
``This is not an antitrust injury.''
   Justices John Paul Stevens and Byron R. White dissented.
   The case is Atlantic Richfield vs. USA Petroleum, 88-1668.

<HEAD>Calm Returns to Madagascar Capital After Failed Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital of this Indian Ocean
island nation was calm today after troops loyal to President Didier
Ratsiraka crushed a coup attempt by armed rebels.
   The government said 13 dissidents were arrested Sunday after
loyalist troops stormed the national radio station, which rebels
had seized.
   Information Minister Jean-Claude Rahaga said in a statement late
Sunday the dissidents ``were being interrogated and would appear in
court.''
   ``It is quite calm in the streets today. It seems it's all
over,'' a U.S. Embassy official in Antananarivo said on condition
of anonymity.
   Hospitals reported at least three people died and 15 were
wounded by bullets and grenades in Sunday's fighting. Government
officials had not confirmed the casualty figures.
   The rebels seized the station early Sunday and announced that
Ratsiraka's government had been overthrown. Loyalist troops
launched tear gas canisters into the station and exchanged gunfire
with the dissidents, reportedly armed with automatic rifles,
pistols and knives.
   Soldiers overpowered the rebels after a six-hour battle. The
director of the radio network said eight employees taken hostage
were freed by troops. No one died inside the station, he said.
   There were no reports of disturbances elsewhere on Sunday on the
island nation of 10 million people.
   The rebels claimed to be members of a previously unknown group
called the Republican Committee of Public Safety. Their political
beliefs were unknown.
   It was the second time in a year that opponents of Ratsiraka had
seized the state Radio Madagascar station.
   On July 14, 1989, six armed men took over the national radio and
claimed the government had been toppled. However, government troops
took back the station and there was no violence elsewhere.
   Ratsiraka has led Madagascar since he was installed by the
military in June 1975. The country, which is off the east coast of
Africa, gained independence from France in 1960.
   Ratsiraka was elected to seven-year presidential terms in 1975,
1982 and 1989. In last year's elections, the opposition charged
fraud and demanded that Ratsiraka step down.
   In recent years, the president has modified his Marxist views
and adopted free market economic policies.
   On Sunday the rebels broadcast an appeal urging people to rise
against the government and demanding that retired Gen. Jean
Rakotoharison, an opposition leader, be named president.
   The broadcast was cut off after about 45 minutes, and government
forces surrounded the building.
   Witnesses said Rakotoharison joined a crowd of about 5,000
milling outside the radio station and declined the rebel offer.
   Gangs of youths roamed the streets later, setting two cars
ablaze and hurling rocks through the windows of the Justice
Ministry and the American Cultural Center, the U.S. Embassy
official said. No Americans were injured, he said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Consider Increasing Judgment Against Hare
Krishnas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to consider
increasing a $5 million judgment that the justices were told
already threatens to destroy the Hare Krishna religion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which a
California woman sought to have restored millions of dollars in
damages a jury awarded her.
   The award was reduced by appeals courts and now, with interest,
totals about $5 million.
   The justices today took no definitive action on the religious
sect's still-pending appeal of rulings that, if left standing,
could force the sale of five Hare Krishna temples across the
country and in Canada.
   Lawyers for the Krishnas argue, among other things, that the
California court judgment violates the church's religious freedom.
   Various corporate entities of the International Society of
Krishna Consciousness and two Krishna officials were sued
successfully by a mother and daughter, Marcia and Robin George of
Cypress, Calif.
   Their 1977 lawsuit alleged that Robin had been brainwashed by
the Krishnas when she was 14 and that Krishna leaders conspired to
keep her away from her parents.
   A California jury in 1983 awarded the Georges $32.5 million in
damages against the Krishnas, but the award was reduced on appeal
to $2.9 million. With interest, the judgment today is estimated to
be in excess of $5 million.
   A state judge has ordered that five Krishna temples already
placed under court supervision, including the religion's
headquarters in Los Angeles, be sold and the proceeds be paid to
the Georges.
   The other temples are located in Southern California and the New
York City area, according to David Liberman, a Los Angeles lawyer
for the Krishnas.
   The sales presumably would be unnecessary if the judgment is
paid before they occur.
   The state Supreme Court refused last November to review the
award.
   Miss George and a friend, 16-year-old Caron Dempsey, visited a
Hare Krishna temple in Laguna Beach, Calif., for the first time in
1974 at Miss Dempsey's suggestion.
   Miss Dempsey later decided to join the religious sect, and
persuaded Miss George to attend meetings at the temple.
   By the fall of 1974, Miss George was wearing a sari while
attending school and chanting and praying at a Hindu-style altar in
her bedroom.
   According to court documents, a Krishna official told Miss
George to leave her home and live at a temple. She did, spending
time with Hare Krishnas in Laguna Beach, San Diego, New Orleans,
Buffalo, N.Y., and Ottawa, Canada.
   The Georges' lawsuit alleged that Krishna officials conspired to
keep Miss George from her parents, who learned of her whereabouts
in late 1975 only after Miss Dempsey left the religion and told
them.
   Lawyers for the Krishnas say the award won by the Georges
amounts to religious bigotry.
   ``For the first time in this country since the anti-Mormon
frenzy of the 19th Century, an entire religion stands subject to
destruction and the confiscation of its property at the hands of
the state,'' the sect's still-pending appeal says.
   It adds: ``The proceeding below turned into a trial of what (the
Georges') counsel called the `pernicious evil' of the Krishna
Consciousness religion, and ... the jury awarded damages ...
calculated to bring the religion in this country to an end.''
   The case acted on today is Robin George vs. International
Society of Krishna Consciousness, 89-1398.

   A New York City psychologist who says author
Shana Alexander's 1985 book ``Nutcracker'' falsely accused him of
having sexual intimacy with a patient failed today in Supreme Court
bid to reinstate his libel lawsuit.
   The justices, without comment, let stand state court rulings
that dismissed Herman Weiner's suit.
   Ms. Alexander's non-fiction book explored the Salt Lake City
murder of Mormon millionaire Franklin Bradshaw, a crime for which
Bradshaw's 17-year-old grandson Marc Schreuder was convicted.
   Based on the youth's trial testimony, his mother Frances
Bradshaw Schreuder was convicted of masterminding her father's
murder. Both are imprisoned.
   As described in court documents, the book delves into the
Bradshaw family's history of emotional disturbance. It purportedly
portrays Mrs. Schreuder as a person whose deep emotional
disturbances were manifested in child abuse, persistent lying and
two stormy, broken marriages.
   Mrs. Schreuder was a patient of Weiner's for about three years
in the 1960s and in 1982. He testified on her behalf during a
divorce and child custody proceeding in the mid-1960s. Many other
psychologists and pyschiatrists treated Mrs. Schreuder.
   Weiner is mentioned in two paragraphs of ``Nutcracker.'' The
second paragraph concludes by quoting someone who claimed,
``Frances always slept with her shrinks'' and stating that others
``suspected hanky panky.''
   New York's highest court tossed out Weiner's suit against Ms.
Alexander and the book's publisher, Doubleday &amp; Co., last Dec. 14.
   The state court relied on a previous ruling in which it placed
the burden on some libel plaintiffs to prove those sued ``acted in
a grossly irresponsible manner without due consideration for the
standards of information gathering and dissemination ordinarily
followed by responsible parties.''
   The state court said Weiner had not raised a ``triable issue ...
as to ... gross irresponsibility.''
   The case is Weiner vs. Doubleday &amp; Co., 89-1420.

<HEAD>Brain-Dead Woman's Heart Fails; Husband Objected to Respirator
Turnoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brain-dead woman's heart stopped beating
this morning, hours before a hospital planned to disconnect her
from a respirator over the objections of her husband.
   Isabel McFall, 56, had been unconscious since April 17, when a
blood vessel burst in her brain. Officials at St. John Medical
Center said declared her brain dead a week later.
   Her husband, Bill McFall, had picketed the hospital Sunday in
protest of the hospital's plans to disconnect the life-support
system this morning. He said he wanted his wife to remain on the
respirator to give God time to work a miracle.
   Doctors said she met Oklahoma's criteria to be declared legally
dead: no electrical or chemical activity was detectable in her
brain.
   McFall said the hospital called him about 2:30 a.m. today and
told him that his wife's heart had failed.
   ``God took her home. ... God knew there was just such a burden
on the family. I was satisfied there was no chicanery and that God
had performed his will,'' McFall said.
   Hospital spokesman Stephen Reynolds said her ``heart stopped
beating spontaneously.'' Reynolds said McFall came to the hospital
and agreed to disconnect the respirator.
   McFall had picketed the hospital on Sunday for about 45 minutes,
carrying a sign reading, ``Execution, May 9th, 1990.'' The date
apparently referred to the original deadline he believes doctors
set for turning off the machine that circulated his wife's blood.
   Hospital officials contended Oklahoma statutes didn't require
them to obtain McFall's consent to disconnect the machine, though
Reynolds said doctors would have liked the family's approval.
   Reynolds said the only reason Mrs. McFall was not disconnected
from life-support machines sooner was compassion for the family
after McFall requested time to adjust.

   William J. Bennett, the Bush
administration's drug policy director, said today he believes the
nation is ``beginning to see a peaking of the addiction problem.''
   Bennett told state and local drug control officials, however,
that any reduction in drug use will not be automatic, but ``if it
happens, it will be by the pressure that we bring to bear.''
   Bennett spoke at the opening of a two-day conference on state
and local drug policy sponsored by his office.
   ``We may now be seeing a levelling off of addiction,'' Bennett
said. ``My sense is that we are now beginning to see a peaking of
the addiction problem.''
   Bennett also said that in the next three to six months he
believes that ``we will at least have some indications'' of the
success of the administration's strategy to reduce the supply of
cocaine from Andean nations.
   Asked about his remarks at a news conference, Bennett said,
``What happens in the next three to six months is that the
agreement at Cartagena begins to take effect. Funds from the United
States will begin to flow.''
   He said actions by the Bolivian, Peruvian and Colombian
governments would also be moving forward. ``There is encouraging
news out of Bolivia in evidence of many farmers selling off coca
cultivation plots and using them for other purposes,'' he said.
   Bennett also said in his speech that ``there is a tendency by
critics of the administration's drug policy to overstate civil
liberties violations by police.''
   ``This is a tough business,'' he said. ``We do not need to
abrogate the Constitution or any of its protections, but we are
going to have to be both tough and law-abiding.''
   Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos also addressed the
conference, saying he believes that ``education is the only
long-term solution to the problem of substance abuse in America.''

   Maj. Harry Kretschmer strolls through a
hallway in an East German army barracks filled with squalling
children and milling adults.
   ``Every day there are more. The come here, see the free food and
the free housing, and call home. Then more come,'' he says. ``We do
not know what to do with them. We are filled to capacity.''
   About 700 Romanians and a few hundred Bulgarians have been
packed into two barracks at an East German army base on the
outskirts of Berlin. Hundreds more are housed in a building once
used by East Germany's feared secret police.
   East Germany, reeling from a creaky economy and its own exodus
of citizens to West Germany, suddenly finds itself luring other
East Europeans whose countries do not have a wealthy neighbor to
help them emerge from four decades of Stalinist oppression.
   The government said it decided last week to begin housing and
feeding the Romanians and Bulgarians who show up daily in train
stations with battered bags of belongings, but no money.
   Many see East Germany now as the new threshhold of the West, a
passageway to prosperity.
   ``I came here for work and to escape the Communists,'' says
Taian Neascu, 19, from Bucharest. ``I want to go to West Germany,
and go to America.''
   About 3,000 Romanians already have flooded into East Berlin in
the last two weeks and another 15,000 have crossed the border into
East Germany, said Joachim Krabs, a city social services official.
   He said 650 arrived today alone and that about 20,000 Poles also
have arrived in recent weeks.
   Krabs said the situation was a ``social powder keg'' and called
for new laws to limit the flood.
   Matthias Jahr, a member of the East Berlin Foreigners
Commission, said his office has received numerous requests for
asylum from Soviet Jews who want to flee a new wave of
anti-Semitism.
   The flood of Romanians began in late April, about the time
political strife intensified in the country.
   Some Romanians believe the revolutionary interim government of
acting President Ion Iliescu will not differ substantially from the
Communist regime that was overthrown in December.
   Scores of Romanians began sleeping and wandering the large train
station in Lichtenberg, the huge foreign quarter of East Berlin.
   ``At first we were ignorant of the problem. Then we found all of
these people sleeping in the train station,'' said Hannelora
Gensch, an East Berlin housing official who runs the complex at the
army base in the Beisdorf district of East Berlin.
   Children typically roam subway and train stations, sent by their
parents with cards printed in German: ``We are Romanian, please
help us with money.''
   Many are sick when they arrive, and most are afraid, Mrs. Gensch
said.
   ``We have had to put people in the hospital because of their
fear,'' she said. ``The government has to make a decision on what
to do with these people.''
   The stream comes just as a wave of resentment of foreigners is
sweeping East Germany, fueled mainly by fears that the country will
face widespread joblessness as it merges with West Germany and
converts to a free market.
   Violent street clashes between foreigners and East German youth
gangs broke out in Lichtenberg a week ago.
   One Romanian in the barracks, a 36-year-old man who said he
drove a taxi in Constanza, said he left behind three young children
when he came to East Berlin five days ago. He said he has no plans
to return.
   ``I cannot tell you my name because it would be bad for my
family,'' he said.
   Kretschmer said he believes the motives are more economic than
political.
   Some Romanians at the barracks said they fled because they
believed a new crackdown on travel would be imposed after May 20,
when Iliescu is widely expected to win the Romanian elections.
   Most came here on tourist visas, and some said they still
planned to go home. But a bearded coalminer from the city of
Resita, who refuses to give his name, says he has no plans to
return.
   ``Iliescu and and Ceausescu are the same,'' he says, referring
to the hard-line Romanian leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, who was
toppled and executed in December.
   Jahr said the government should discuss visa requirements with
other East European countries as a way of limiting the flow.
   ``We don't want to build a new wall,'' he said.

   A deeply divided Supreme Court today refused
to lift a Georgia judge's injunction barring an anti-abortion group
from blocking access to abortion clinics in Atlanta.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, rejected an emergency request by five
members of the group, Operation Rescue, who said the injunction is
violating their free-speech rights.
   The March 29 injunction permanently bars anti-abortion
demonstrators within 50 feet of the property line of any Atlanta
facility where abortions are performed.
   Since July 1988, when Atlanta hosted the National Democratic
Convention, city police have arrested 1,320 demonstrators at
Operation Rescue sit-ins. Many of the protesters barricaded
abortion clinics, blocking patients and employees from entering or
leaving.
   City officials sought and obtained the state court injunction.
The Georgia Supreme Court refused on April 25 to set it aside.
   Five members of Operation Rescue then sought emergency help from
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who referred the request to the full
court.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Refused to let 30 states sue 26 manufacturers in the nation's
highest court over removal of asbestos from public schools and
other government buildings.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
manufacturers should pay for such removal.
   _ Ruled that price-cutting schemes that hurt a competitor's
business do not necessarily violate antitrust laws.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices killed a lawsuit against Atlantic
Richfield Co. (ARCO) by independent gas stations in California and
Washington state.
   The court said that only when a company's price-cutting can be
proved to be ``predatory'' and harmful does it violate the Sherman
Act, a major antitrust law.
   _ Squelched a lawsuit charging the United Steelworkers union
with negligence in a 1972 Idaho silver mine disaster that killed 91
miners.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said the state court suit was
pre-empted by federal labor law.
   _ Refused to revive a lawsuit accusing the Reagan administration
of unlawfully bombing Libya in 1986 with help from Great Britain.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit and also ordered the Libyans and their lawyers _ including
former Attorney General Ramsey Clark _ to pay penalties and the
British government's legal costs.
   _ Rejected appeals by 13 men convicted in the so-called pizza
connection drug-trafficking conspiracy.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the men's
rights were not violated in what was one of the longest and
costliest trials in U.S. history.
   _ Refused to consider increasing a $5 million judgment that the
justices were told already threatens to destroy the Hare Krishna
religion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which a
California woman sought to have restored millions of dollars in
damages a jury awarded her.
   The award was reduced by appeals courts and now, with interest,
totals about $5 million.
   The court's 5-4 vote in the Operation Rescue case produced
strange judicial bedfellows.
   Joining to deny the emergency request _ and thus leave the
injunction intact _ were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Blackmun and Stevens often are characterized as liberals on
issues such as abortion and free speech. Rehnquist, White and
O'Connor are most often referred to as conservatives on those
points.
   Voting in dissent to lift the injunction were the court's two
most consistent liberals _ Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall _ and two conservatives, Kennedy and Justice Antonin
Scalia.
   Writing for the dissenters, Kennedy cited a 1977 decision
involving Nazis demonstrating in the heavily Jewish community of
Skokie, Ill.
   Kennedy said that decision ``does not distinguish among speakers
based on the content of their speech.''
   Operation Rescue members Michael Hirsch, Gina Robertson, William
Haynes, Steve Britt and Pamela Sekulow said the Atlanta injunction
deters them ``from engaging in prayer, picketing, leafleting and
other forms of peaceful expression on public forum streets and
sidewalks.''
   Legal challenges to Operation Rescue demonstrations at abortion
clinics have left the organization so far in debt it has closed
down its national headquarters in Binghamton, N.Y.
   Operation Rescue's founder, Randall Terry, spent time in jail
until a contempt-of-court fine for violating a similar injunction
in New York was paid.
   Hirsch has stepped down as director of the group's Atlanta
chapter, and has not been replaced.
   The case is Hirsch vs. Atlanta, A-752.

   A man who fled Dallas after his girlfriend's 1960
shooting death and lived a new life for almost 30 years pleaded
guilty to a murder charge today.
   Robert Lee Mitchell, 64, left Dallas for Chicago after the
shooting in 1960 and began a new life as ``Billy Jackson.'' He
married and had five children and three grandchildren before a
computer check of old warrants turned up a fingerprint connection
between Mitchell and ``Jackson.''
   He was returned to Dallas late last year.
   Mitchell said then that he would plead guilty, take the
consequences and put the killing behind him. But he insisted the
shooting of Billie Marie Redmon Phillips, his 29-year-old
girlfriend, was really an accident. He said the gun went off during
a struggle.
   Sentencing is set for Friday before State District Judge Ron
Chapman.

   President Abdou Diouf of Senegal, concerned
that Iraq may be building a missile test site in his backyard, met
with President Bush at the White House today.
   Senegalese officials said Diouf was seeking information about
reports based on U.S. intelligence information that Iraq wants to
install a testing site for its long-range missiles in Mauritania.
   Taking advantage of beautiful spring weather, Bush posed for
pictures with Diouf in the sun-splashed Rose Garden rather than in
the Oval Office, where they held talks.
   Although Diouf's week-long visit to Washington is being billed
as a private one, he has a full schedule of meetings _ including
the White House call on Bush, talks with Treasury and Commerce
Department leaders and with the heads of the IMF and World Bank.
   Mauritania and Senegal broke diplomatic relations in August
after a minor border dispute flared into violence in both countries
in which hundreds of people were killed.
   The Organization of African Unity has been unsuccessful in
efforts to mediate between the two West African neighbors, although
it has averted an immediate threat of war. The United States has
supported the mediation and tried to maintain its ties with both
countries.
   Privately, however, U.S. officials asked Mauritania whether it
had agreed to let Iraq build a missile range on its territory,
Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly said last month. Mauritania
denied the reports, but Iraq has refused to confirm or deny them.
   The United States is worried about Iraq's efforts to develop
missiles that could carry lethal chemical weapons to Israel or
Iran, two countries with which Iraq is technically at war.
   In recent weeks, U.S. and British agents have intercepted
several shipments of devices allegedly intended for Iraq's missile
and nuclear weapons programs. Iraq has denied it is building atomic
weapons but announced it has developed a missile with a 1,200-mile
range.
   Iraq does not have enough land to test the new missile but
Mauritania does. The arid Moslem land bordering the Atlantic Ocean
has an area of about 400,000 square miles and is sparsely populated.
   Both Iraq and Mauritania are members of the Arab League and Iraq
has been supplying weapons to Mauritania, said a U.S. official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Iraq enjoys good ties with Senegal
too.
   Senegal is one of the staunchest U.S. allies in Africa,
receiving an average of $40 million annually and having strong
cultural ties to American organizations.
   U.S. officials hold up Senegal as an example that multi-party
democracy can work in Africa, where tribal divisions have hampered
the evolution of Western-style political systems.
   Diouf took office in January 1981. In 1988 his Socialist Party
won 73 percent of the vote and although observers agree there was
some election fraud, there was little doubt Diouf won.
   Diouf has accepted demands by Senegal's creditors, including the
United States, for economic changes that would make his government
and the private sector more efficient. But he plans to ask U.S.
officials, as well as leaders of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, for a more relaxed pace of reform.
   Senegal owes about $3.6 billion, most of it to other
governments, but it has a good repayment record.

   Five Mohawks face
arraignment today on charges stemming from the slaying of an Indian
during a gunbattle over casino gambling on the reservation, police
in Canada said.
   Quebec Provincial Police declined to identify the five men or
say what specific charges would be lodged against them. Police
spokeswoman Jeanette Couture said the men were being charged in
connection with the May 1 slaying of 31-year-old Harold Edwards.
   The men were to appear at a proceeding in the Quebec Provincial
Court in Valleyfield, just south of Montreal, she said.
   Four of the men were taken into custody Sunday morning and taken
by helicopter to police headquarters in Montreal in connection with
the May 1 shooting death of 31-year-old Harold Edwards, police
spokesman Robert Poeti said.
   It was not clear when or where the fifth man was taken into
custody.
   Poeti said an investigation continues as well into the shooting
of 22-year-old Matthew Pyke on the same day. Both slayings took
place on the Canadian side of the 28,000-acre reservation, which
straddles the border.
   Pyke was said to oppose gambling. Some on the reservation have
said Edwards favored gambling; others said he was neutral.
   The Mohawks are divided over whether to allow gambling on the
reservation. The dispute has been marked by gunfire and arson.
After the slayings, hundreds of police officers moved in, and the
reservation has been largely peaceful.
   Opponents say the reservation's casinos brings drugs, guns and
prostitution. Supporters say they create jobs and revenue by
drawing busloads of people eager to play slot machines, craps,
roulette and other games.

   Louisiana farmers today braced for the most disastrous flooding
in 45 years. About 7,000 people were urged to leave low-lying areas
in Texas, and workmen dynamited a breached levee to prevent further
damage in Arkansas.
   Highways reopened and flood victims began cleaning up in
Oklahoma as National Guardsmen, inmates, farmers and volunteers
filled sandbags and shored up levees in Louisiana and Arkansas.
   ``This is my home. If there was anything I could do, I was going
to do it,'' said Rosie Blair, who worked alongside her husband and
14-year-old son in Texarkana, Ark.
   Over the past three weeks, 13 deaths have been blamed on
flooding: 12 in Texas and one in Oklahoma. In addition, a farmer
despondent over possibly losing his crops to flooding in northwest
Louisiana shot his wife and then himself in what appeared to be a
suicide pact, The Times of Shreveport reported today, quoting
sources it didn't identify.
   In Louisiana, heavy weekend rain compounded the flood threat as
the Red River continued its rise from Shreveport to Alexandria. The
river was expected to crest 5 feet above flood stage in Shreveport
on Wednesday and had already overflowed in places.
   About 60 families in the Shreveport area were evacuated Sunday
as the rising Red River pushed into the bayous that usually feed
it. ``We expect upwards of about 100 more families to be evacuated
over the next few days,'' said Chuck Mazziotti, civil defense
director for Caddo and Bossier parishes.
   Up to 600 square miles, including 200 square miles of farmland,
will flood in Louisiana this week and next, and up to 500 homes and
camps between the levees and the river will be inundated, said U.S.
Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
   ``It will be a major agricultural disaster. It'll be a flood
event such as we have not experienced since 1945,'' Johnston said
after meeting with Army Corps of Engineers officials.
   In Avoyelles Parish, National Guardsmen joined with about 50
Vick community members to finish a four-mile levee to protect
recently planted corn, cotton and soybean fields.
   In Texas, about 7,000 residents downstream of Lake Livingston
Dam, 60 miles northeast of Houston, were told to evacuate their
homes along the rain-swollen Trinity River. Officials said water
was pouring over the reservoir's spillway at more than twice the
normal rate.
   Sightseers carrying lawn chairs and cameras gathered in
southeastern Texas as residents decided whether to pack up and
leave.
   ``I'm going to get as far away as I can,'' said Tina Lapaglia,
who spent Mother's Day with her husband and two children at a
campground after abandoning their home in Camilla Twin Harbors.
``Tomorrow I'll look for a new place for us to live.''
   ``I'm going to stay here as long as I can,'' said John Burch,
32, a fisherman from Liberty. ``My father is a cancer patient and
we have to be careful with him.''
   Along the Texas-Oklahoma line, on the headwaters of the Red
River, only one highway in the Lake Texoma area remained closed
Sunday by record flooding one week earlier. The lake had flooded
homes and cabins.
   Downstream, workers blew up a section of a failed levee in Bowie
County, Texas, to relieve pressure on a backup levee protecting
several communities in Arkansas.
   Five blasts widened the gap and eased the pressure of flood
water pouring through the breach, removing the threat to the final
floodwater barrier.
   ``If the levee goes, we'll be looking at 250 to 300 homes
affected,'' said Gary Talley of the Arkansas Office of Emergency
Services.
   More than 100 Guardsmen in southwestern Arkansas sandbagged and
helped with flood problems. A helicopter and four river barges
patrolled along the river, helping feed cattle stranded on
flood-created islands.
   James Roberts of Foreman was 23 in 1938, the last time major
flooding occurred on the Red River. But he said it was nothing like
this.
   ``All my wheat's gone,'' he said. ``I had 320 acres. I'd just
got out of a `tight.' And now this. I hope we get some quick
relief.''

<HEAD>Court Rules Governor Cannot Withhold Local Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' State Supreme Judicial Court ruled
today that Gov. Michael S. Dukakis had no authority to withhold
$210 million in local aid payments to municipalities.
   The unanimous decision added more uncertainty to the state's
attempts to solve its fiscal crisis.
   Dukakis made the cut from the current year's budget to help
resolve the state's deficit, now pegged at $1 billion. But cities
and towns sued the state, led by the town of Brookline, Dukakis'
hometown.
   Dukakis also has threatened to withhold an additional $500
million from local aid payments at the end of the current fiscal
year.
   Municipalities argued that the cuts in funding jeopardize local
budgets, threatening schools and other services.
   ``We're thrilled and hopefully this will help as we go through
these troubled times in local government,'' said Paul Moran,
spokesman for the Massachusetts Municipalities Association.
   The high court noted that state law allows the governor to
reduce certain allotments when revenues are insufficient to meet
expenditures. State law further describes what funds are subject to
control by the governor.
   But the court ruled that the local aid funds ``are not `made
available' to any state agency `under the control of the governor
or a secretary.'''
   Dukakis, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president in
1988, has battled a state budget crunch almost continuously since
that election. He has said he won't seek another term.

<HEAD>South African Leader To Visit Washington Next Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela, South African black leader
freed after 27 years in jail, will visit President Bush at the
White House next month and be feted with a tickertape parade in New
York City, organizers announced today.
   Mandela, head of the African National Congress, will visit
Washington and five other U.S. cities toward the end of June, said
a news release by Fenton Communications, which represents the ANC.
   An ANC source in New York said Mandela would arrive in the
United States on June 20. A news conference to announce the exact
schedule of the visit is scheduled here on Tuesday.
   Bush issued an invitation to Mandela in a personal telephone
call last February, as soon as Mandela was released from prison
where he had been serving a life sentence for plotting to overthrow
the South African government.
   The White House has not yet announced when Mandela will meet
with the president but administration sources have said the visit
would be in late June.
   Mandela will also address a joint session of Congress _ the
highest honor lawmakers can pay visiting dignitaries _ and hold
meetings with congressional leaders.
   He will thank U.S. leaders for their support during his years of
incarceration and urge them to preserve economic sanctions against
South Africa's government to press its white leadership to
dismantle the apartheid system of racial segregation, organizers
said.
   The United States imposed limitations on trade with South Africa
in 1986. The Bush administration has indicated it might be willing
to ease some of the limitations following some lifting of
restrictions on the black population adopted by the government of
F.W. De Klerk in recent months.
   Bush has also invited De Klerk to visit Washington, and
officials on both sides are trying to arrange the dates.
   The ANC, which was recently made legal by De Klerk after being
banned for decades, began talks with the government earlier this
month to discuss the future of apartheid.

<HEAD>Obscenity Debate Over Group's Recording Reaches Federal Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The debate over whether the lyrics
of a recording by the million-selling rap group 2 Live Crew are
obscene moved to a higher level today with the issue's first airing
in federal court.
   U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez was asked to determine if ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' which has been removed from store shelves
in several Florida counties, should also be banned in Broward
County.
   The county ordered the ban. Lawyers for the Miami-based group
then asked Gonzalez to lift the ban.
   The first witness to testify today, Broward Detective Sgt. Mark
Wichner, said he found the recording ``extremely explicit and
degrading to the female sex.''
   The detective sought and received a ruling from a circuit judge
that it was probably obscene. Then, he said he visited Fort
Lauderdale-area record stores, warning personnel they could be
prosecuted on obscenity charges for selling the recording.
   On cross-examination, 2 Live Crew lawyer Bruce Rogow said the
sheriff's office file on the recording contained ``not one
complaint'' from a citizen of Broward County about it. He argued
that the police investigation had revealed nothing indicating the
recording violated community standards of obscenity.
   Three of the group's four members _ David Hobbs, whose stage
name is Mr. Mixx; Chris Wongwon, known as Fresh Kid Ice; and Mark
Ross, who performs as Brother Marquis _ were present for the
trial's start.
   Leader Luther Campbell was expected later, said Debbie Bennett,
a spokeswoman for the group's record company. Campbell has used the
name Luke Skyywalker but is currently prohibited from doing so
pending settlement of a lawsuit by the creators of the ``Star
Wars'' movies.
   John Jolly, attorney for the Broward Sheriff's Office, said
before the trial that the purpose of the case ``is to tell us if it
is protected First Amendment speech or disposable, unprotected
smut.''
   ``The tape speaks for itself,'' Jolly said.
   But there's merit to what it says, according to Rogow.
   ``Put in its historical context, it is a novel and creative use
of sound and lyrics,'' he said. He plans to call music critics to
testify about the artistic value of the recording.
   ``The trouble is you have a bunch of white folks who don't
understand the culture,'' Rogow said. ``The primary reason for
writing these songs was humor, to make people think and reflect the
kind of talk that occurs in the community where the four people who
make up 2 Live Crew have lived all their lives.''
   The album ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' has sold nearly 2
million copies, while a toned-down version of the album has sold
about 300,000 copies.

   Fidel Castro works 14 to 16 hours a day, has
stopped smoking cigars and feels as fit as he did 30 years ago, the
Cuban President told a group of Spanish journalists, according to
reports from Havana today.
   The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, monitored in New York, said
Castro met recently with the Spanish reporters at the Varadero
seaside resort.
   Castro was invited to the inauguration of a hotel built by a
consortium of Spanish and Cuban companies.
   Noting that on Aug. 13 he will be 64, Castro said he works with
as much enthusiasm as on the first day of the revolution that
brought him to power in 1960.
   ``Remember, I don't smoke,'' he said, adding that he did not
quit for personal reasons but rather to support a Cuban
anti-smoking campaign. ``I didn't find it difficult because my
motivation was very strong.''
   The Cuban leader said he engages in sports every day, especially
swimming and snorkeling. He said he used to play baseball and
basketball but he needed two teams and nobody wanted to be referee.

  rnment in its civil war, despite claims
by Vietnam that it withdrew the last of its troops in September, a
U.S. official said Monday.
   Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs,
said statements by East European diplomats, some Vietnamese
officials, and other sources indicate Vietnamese troops either
remained behind or have returned to Cambodia since September.
   Such reports began surfacing early this year. Vietnam denies the
allegations.
   Solomon spoke at a news conference in Bangkok, where he was
visiting as part of a regional tour.
   ``There apparently are at least advisers operating in combat
support roles, intelligence, command and control functions, and
actively participating in combat operations going on inside
Cambodia,'' he said.
   ``As far as numbers are concerned, frankly we don't have a clear
fix on that. It is probably in the low thousands.''
   He said the significant issue was not the exact number of
soldiers but rather that their presence showed the Cambodian
government remained weak and required Vietnamese support. The
government, installed by a Vietnamese invasion in late 1978, has
been fighting three guerrilla groups backed by the United States
and other countries.
   Current peace efforts center on a proposal for the United
Nations to administer the country on an interim basis and supervise
elections. But the Cambodian government and the guerrillas disagree
over the extent of U.N. participation.

   A railway bridge that obscured a famous view of
St. Paul's Cathedral in London for 125 years was removed early
Monday.
   The iron bridge was constructed in 1865 across Ludgate Hill. Its
removal restored a splendid vista of Sir Christopher Wren's domed
cathedral down Fleet Street, across Ludgate Circus and up the hill.
   The bridge carried a railway between Blackfriars and Holborn
Viaduct that is being replaced by a new underground line.

   Three convicts stabbed two fellow

police as they ran from the jail, officials said Monday.
   The incident took place Sunday in Tacloban City, 360 miles from
Manila, a police report said.
   It said the three prisoners forced open the jail gate, stabbed
two other prisoners, and then fled into a wooded area.
   The injured inmates alerted police, who opened fire at the
fleeing prisoners when they refused to stop.

U.S, Soviet and West European programs.
   The broadcast, which replaced Soviet programming formerly
available on the same channel, will reach approximately 30 percent
of Czechoslovakia's territory, the Socialist daily Svobodne Slovo
said.
   Of the other two Czechoslovak channels, one broadcasts
nationwide, and the other broadcasts in Czech or Slovak, depending
on the region.
   The programming of the third channel was made available by
foreign TV stations such as La Sept and TV 5 of France, CNN of the
United States and the U.S.-government run World Net and Soviet

   It will include language courses, sports, news, and music,
Svobodne Slovo said.

<TEXT>
   Mongolia has scheduled its first multiparty
legislative elections for July 29, China's official Xinhua News
Agency reported Monday.
   In a dispatch from the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, Xinhua
quoted Mongolia's official news agency, Montsame, as saying the
date was set by the Great People's Hural, the national legislature.
   Currently, more than 93 percent of the 370 seats in the Great
People's Hural are held by members of the ruling Communist party.
   After weeks of demonstrations inspired by the democratic changes
elsewhere in the Soviet bloc, the party decided in March to give up
its constitutional monopoly on power and allow other parties.
   The Hural elected in July will in turn elect a president and a
new 53-seat standing legislature, called the Small Hural. The Great
People's Hural, which generally meets only once or twice a year,
voted last week to establish the standing body.
   The Great People's Hural last week also rejected demands by the
new opposition parties for direct presidential elections, and
passed a law setting requirements for parties to register.
   Among other things, each party must have at least 801 members _
a higher minimum than the opposition wanted. The ruling party has
about 90,000 members.
   Five non-communist parties have formed since late last year.
Most of their members are young professionals, academics and civil
servants.

   Bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled the Ninoy Aquino International

   Airport police investigator Cpl. Manuel Wong said Hamad refused
to say what he was doing in the ceiling and would not disclose his
nationality. Police said they were investigating whether Hamad was

   Officials have tightened security at the airport since an

   The blast killed eight passengers, and officials were looking

   A satellite that began orbiting the moon March 18
has been unable to transmit, leaving Japanese scientists uncertain
of its exact position, officials said Monday.
   Scientists have confirmed with telescopes that the tiny
satellite, named Hagoromo, is orbiting the moon as planned. But
they have not received any signals from it, said Kuninori Uesugi of
the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science.
   A bad transistor was probably responsible for the failure of the
satellite's transmitter, Uesugi said.
   The satellite was to have sent regular data about its
temperature and electrical status, which also would have been used
to determine its exact location.
   Otherwise, Uesugi said, the mission has been successful. Its
primary goal was to give scientists experience in successfully
targeting orbits.
   The satellite separated March 18 from a larger satellite, named
Hiten. Hiten is continuing to circle Earth.

<TEXT>
   Legislators of Zambia's ruling party have
agreed to hold a referendum on whether Zambia should adopt a
multiparty system, it was reported Monday.
   Both of Zambia's main newspapers said the central committee of
the United National Independence Party endorsed President Kenneth
Kaunda's proposal for a referendum.
   Before a referendum can be held, a special session of the
national council _ a policy review body of the party _ must decide
whether to amend the constitution. The constitution currently
forbids referendums.
   Kaunda adopted the system of one-party rule in 1973, and his
party has held power unchallenged since then.
   Last month, Kuanda proposed to his party that voters be asked to
decide the fate of the one-party system. He still opposes a
multiparty system, saying it would provoke factional fighting in
this southern African nation.
   Zambia, one of Africa's poorest and most indebted nations, last
held a referendum in 1969. That vote endorsed measures by Kaunda to
establish a one-party system.

<TEXT>
   The Iranian-backed Moslem faction
Hezbollah sponsored a women's sit-in today and urged kidnappers to
hold on to their Western hostages until Arab prisoners are released
by Israel.
   ``We ask the hostage-holders not to release any more of the
foreign captives until all our loved ones are released from the
Zionist jails,'' chanted Umm Ahmed, who refused to give her full
name.
   About 50 other women echoed her chant during the one-hour
demonstration at a house in Beirut's southern suburb of Bir Hassan
used for guests of the United Nations peacekeeping force in
southern Lebanon.
   Umm Ahmed said tearfully that her son Ahmed, 21, was captured by
Israeli troops in Beirut during the 1982 invasion, and that she had
heard nothing about him since.
   The leader of an Israeli-backed militia that holds 300 Moslems
in southern Lebanon said Sunday he would be willing to trade a
``large number'' for 16 Western hostages held by pro-Iranian
Shiites.
   Gen. Antoine Lahd, the commander of the South Lebanon Army
militia, said he would include in the trade three Israeli
servicemen and several of his men held by Shiite factions.
   ``I'm not only prepared to facilitate such a package deal, but I
also hope it could happen,'' Lahd said in an interview with The
Associated Press at his house in Marjayoun in southern Lebanon.
   Lahd, 61, a retired Lebanese army officer, commands the
3,000-strong militia that is backed by about 1,000 Israeli troops
and patrols Israel's self-proclaimed six- to 10-mile-wide security
zone in southern Lebanon.
   The South Lebanon Army holds the 300 Shiites in Khiam, a small
village in the zone, which was created in 1985 after Israel ended a
three-year occupation.
   In Jerusalem, a senior government spokesman asked about Lahd's
offer, said: ``I don't think it depends on Lahd or on us but on the
other side.''
   Asked if there was any sign of movement from the other side, the
spokesman said on condition of anonymity, ``none that I know of.''
   Most of the 16 Western hostages missing in Lebanon are held by
pro-Iranian Shiite factions operating under the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God. The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42,
chief Middle East correspondent for The AP, who was kidnapped in
March 1985.
   Two American hostages, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, were
released by their pro-Iranian captors last month as a ``goodwill
gesture.''
   Since then, however, there have been contradictory statements
from Iran on any further releases. President Bush has refused to
deal for freedom for the hostages, who include six Americans.
   There was no immediate reaction to Lahd's offer from pro-Iranian
factions in Lebanon or from Iran.
   Iranian leaders hoping to improve ties with the West have said
all hostages should be freed this year. But radicals argue that
holding hostages is a means of confronting the West, which the
anti-Western faction considers a cornerstone of the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.
   In the past, kidnappers and their backers have said the release
of the Shiites held by Lahd and Israel would help end the hostages'
ordeal. They have also said they want help locating four Iranians
missing in Lebanon since 1982. Lahd did not mention the four;
Lebanese sources say they are dead.
   The kidnappers and their backers also have mentioned
specifically the release of Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a Hezbollah
official captured by the Israelis in a raid on his village in
southern Lebanon last July 28.
   Bush recently said that if Israel wanted to free any prisoners
he would not object. He also offered to help locate the four
missing Iranians.
   Obeid is held in Israel and out of Lahd's domain, but he said he
was optimistic that Obeid could be included in trade.
   He added, ``I won't release anybody if our people and the
Israeli servicemen are not freed.''
   The three Israeli soldiers were captured in 1986.
   Lahd said nine of his soldiers have gone missing in clashes with
Moslem factions in southern Lebanon. He said three are held by
Hezbollah and one by the mainstream Shiite Amal militia, backed by
Syria, but the fate of the others was unknown.
   In addition to the six Americans, the Western hostages include
an Irishman, four Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss and an
Italian.
   One of the Britons is Anglican envoy Terry Waite, and the
conservative British weekly Mail on Sunday reported in London that
he was alive and well after more than three years as a hostage.
   A spokesman for the Druse religious sect was quoted as saying
Waite is held alone in superior surroundings because he is believed
the most important of the hostages. Waite traveled to Beirut in
January 1987 to try to negotiate the release of Western hostages,
but disappeared eight days later.

<TEXT>
   A group of masked men wearing
camouflage broke into a high-stakes dice game and began firing at
the gamblers this morning, killing four people and wounding at
least three others, authorities said.
   It was the second fatal shooting in eight months at the Glass
Key Cafe, a lounge known for gambling in a low-income neighborhood
on Fort Worth's east side.
   ``It appears to have been a robbery of a gambling game,'' Police
Chief Thomas Windham said today. ``We have information that it was
an extremely high-dollar gambling game with tens of thousands of
dollars involved.'' He said he didn't know if any money was taken.
   Two people were dead on the scene, another was dead on arrival
at a hospital, and a fourth died in surgery, police spokesman Doug
Clarke said.
   Windham said as many as 15 people were inside the lounge when
the gunmen broke in, but some escaped serious injury by hiding in a
back room.
   Police said four to six men, some wearing camouflage and masks,
kicked in the door of the cafe at about 7 a.m.
   ``They were dressed in camouflage and several of them had on
masks. They hollered `Task Force!' and began shooting,'' Clarke
said.
   The cafe's owner, Albert Huey You, told reporters that two men
entered the lounge, robbed several patrons who were sitting around
drinking coffee, and then began firing what he described as
semi-automatic weapons.
   You said he was nicked in the ear by a shotgun pellet.
   It was the second such shooting at the same lounge in eight
months, said Criminal Investigations chief Randy Ely. Last Oct. 2,
one man was killed when several men, hiding inside the building on
a Monday morning, ``broke into a dice game yelling `Police!' and
shot,'' he said.
   Ely said connections between the two shootings were part of the
investigation but he was unwilling to say whether the two were
related.
   One person was in critical condition and undergoing chest
surgery and a 20-year-old was in fair condition with wounds in the
arm and chest, said officials at John Peter Smith Hospital. A
17-year-old male left the hospital with arm abrasions, against
medical advice, said spokeswoman Drenda Witt.
   Bob Wood, administrative director for John Peter Smith Hospital,
said no slugs had yet been extracted by trauma room workers, but
said he doubted the cafe owner was correct when he said automatic
weapons had been used in the attack.
   Kathy Fridge, spokeswoman at Harris Methodist hospital, said a
man was brought in dead on arrival with a gunshot wound in the
head. She had no other details except that the man was a black male.

   A gunman opened fire on a group of people
in the Chinatown area early today, killing one man and wounding
seven other people, police reported.
   The victims apparently were in a group, and they were fired upon
just before 2 a.m. as they were getting into two cars a short
distance apart.
   The incidents occurred along the North Beach-Chinatown border.
   It was uncertain whether there was more than one gunman, police
said. Sgt. Jerry Senkir said at least three suspects were being
sought.
   The shooting recalled a 1977 massacre in a Chinatown restaurant
that left five dead and 11 wounded. In that early morning assault,
three men armed with semi-automatic rifles burst into the Golden
Dragon restaurant and began shooting at a crowd of about 75.
   That was part of bloody gang wars that raged in Chinatown during
the 1970s.
   Authorities declined to suggest a motive in today's shooting.
   The dead man was identified by coroner's officials as an Asian
male, about 35 years old. His name was being withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   The wounded were taken to San Francisco General Hospital. One
victim was a pregnant woman, who underwent surgery for a hip wound,
said a nursing supervisor who did not give her name. Their names
were not immediately released.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Orders Gradual Opening Of Universities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today ordered a
gradual reopening of six Palestinian universities in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The move is likely to improve Israel's relation with the United
States, which has been strained in recent weeks over Shamir's
stepped up settlement activity in the occupied lands and his
refusal to accept U.S. Middle East peace proposals.
   The army closed Palestinian institutions of higher learning
shortly after the Palestinian uprising erupted in December 1987,
arguing they were hotbeds of anti-Israeli violence.
   But the United States and Western Europe sharply criticized the
measure as collective punishment, and the European Parliament at
one point recommended that scientific cooperation with Israel be
halted until the universities and colleges were reopened.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the prime minister instructed
his adviser for the occupied lands, Shmuel Goren, to meet today
with the heads of the six universities to discuss the gradual
reopening.
   Pazner said that ``we will open the first one (university) in
the next few days,'' but would not say which one. There are five
universities in the West Bank and one in the Gaza Strip with a
total of 18,000 students.
   Pazner said that if the reopening of the first university passed
without violence, other institutions of higher learning would also
reopen.
   ``Our aim is to restore normal life. This will test whether we
can get life back to normal as much as possible,'' Pazner told The
Associated Press.
   He denied that the decision was aimed at appeasing the
administration of President Bush. ``But if it is well-received in
the United States, we will be very pleased,'' he said.
   Sari Nusseibeh, considered by Israel to be one of the leaders of
the uprising, said Israel finally was responding to pressure from
the United States and Europe to reopen the universities.
   He cited as an example the recent visit by Czech President
Vaclav Havel,who brought up the issue in talks with Israeli leaders.
   Throughout the closure, instruction has continued in so-called
underground classes. But attendance has been sporadic and the
education they provide has been far below normal standards.
   ``Nothing is irreparable. People were able to manage, and so
they will be able to pick up as soon as schools will reopen,''
Nusseibeh said.
   Sixteen colleges that also were closed shortly after the
beginning of the uprising were reopened gradually over the past few
months.

<TEXT>
   Foul-mouth comedian Andrew Dice Clay apparently
lifted ``Saturday Night Live'' to its highest ratings all season.
   The show, which was boycotted by cast member Nora Dunn and
singer Sinead O'Connor because of Clay's belligerent humor,
averaged a rating of 11.6 and got a 31 percent share of the
audience in the 24-city overnight Nielsens, NBC said.
   That was 8 points higher than the Feb. 24 ``Saturday Night
Live'' with Fred Savage of ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' as host, NBC
said.
   The highest overnight rating for Saturday's broadcast was in
Chicago, where it had a 17.8 rating and a 37 percent share. In New
York, the nation's largest TV market, it averaged a 15.2 rating and
a 33 percent share.
   National ratings were to be released Thursday.
   NBC's New York and Burbank, Calif., offices got 1,764 calls
against Clay and 198 in his favor in what was probably the highest
number of pre-show protests in the program's 15-year history, NBC
spokesman Curt Block said.
   Clay's appearance, broadcast with a five-second delay to allow
bleeps, drew heavy advance publicity because of the boycotts.
Clay's act has been branded racist and offensive to women and
homosexuals.
   Security was heavy for the show, NBC said. Guards with metal
detectors checked out guests entering both the dress rehearsal and
the live broadcast.
   The only incident in the studio occurred during Clay's opening
monologue, when a couple began shouting ``Clay, Clay, go away!''
They were ejected.
   Clay was paid what an NBC official estimated at $5,000 for his
work. During the program, Clay said he was donating his fee to
``Comic Relief '90,'' a benefit for the homeless televised live on
HBO Saturday night.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ABORTION PROTESTS
   
   A deeply divided Supreme Court refused to lift a Georgia judge's
injunction barring an anti-abortion group from blocking access to
abortion clinics in Atlanta.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, rejected an emergency request by five
members of the group, Operation Rescue, who said the injunction is
violating their free-speech rights.
   The March 29 injunction permanently bars anti-abortion
demonstrators within 50 feet of the property line of any Atlanta
facility where abortions are performed.
   The case is Hirsch vs. Atlanta, A-752.
   
   ASBESTOS
   
   The court refused to let 30 states sue 26 manufacturers in the
nation's highest court over removal of asbestos from public schools
and other government buildings.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
manufacturers should pay for such removal.
   The case is Alabama vs. W.R. Grace, 116 Original.
   
   ANTITRUST
   
   The court ruled that price-cutting schemes that hurt a
competitor's business do not necessarily violate antitrust laws.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices killed a lawsuit against Atlantic
Richfield Co. (ARCO) by independent gas stations in California and
Washington state.
   The court said that only when a company's price-cutting can be
proved to be ``predatory'' and harmful does it violate the Sherman
Act, a major antitrust law.
   The case is Atlantic Richfield vs. USA Petroleum, 88-1668.
   
   MINERS
   
   The court squelched a lawsuit charging the United Steelworkers
union with negligence in a 1972 Idaho silver mine disaster that
killed 91 miners.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said the state court suit was
pre-empted by federal labor law.
   The case is United Steelworkers vs. Rawson, 89-322.
   
   LIBYAN RAID
   
   The court refused to revive a lawsuit accusing the Reagan
administration of unlawfully bombing Libya in 1986 with help from
Great Britain.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit and also ordered the Libyans and their lawyers _ including
former Attorney General Ramsey Clark _ to pay penalties and the
British government's legal costs.
   The case is Saltany vs. Reagan, 89-1497.
   
   PIZZA CONNECTION
   
   The court rejected appeals by 13 men convicted in the so-called
pizza connection drug-trafficking conspiracy.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the men's
rights were not violated in what was one of the longest and
costliest trials in U.S. history.
   The case is Palazzolo vs. U.S., 89-1565.
   
   HARE KRISHNAS
   
   The court refused to consider increasing a $5 million judgment
that the justices were told already threatens to destroy the Hare
Krishna religion.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal in which a
California woman sought to have restored millions of dollars in
damages a jury awarded her.
   The award was reduced by appeals courts and now, with interest,
totals about $5 million.
   The case is Robin George vs. International Society of Krishna
Consciousness, 89-1398.

homeless. More than 500 people died.
   Sea water entered wells and reservoirs of coastal regions in
Andhra Pradesh state, which took the brunt of last week's storm.
Many people were drinking drain water and also using it to cook,
causing stomach disorders, Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
   ``There is no alternative. We can't get water so we have to get
along until the sea recedes,'' the news agency quoted a resident as
saying in Edumondi village.
   It said the entire southern coastal area looked ``as if a
civilization had come to an end ... with most of the places under
complete darkness'' after the cyclone cut power supplies.
   Hundreds of town and villages were without electricity for the
sixth day Monday.
   Relief officials in the state capital, Hyderabad, said about
500,000 people were uprooted after the cyclone. It began in the Bay
of Bengal and started lashing the coast Tuesday with waves up to 33
feet high.
   It roared into India on Wednesday, flattening houses, sweeping
away cattle and uprooting crops, trees and electricity poles.
   Paddy, the main crop in the fertile region, was badly damaged
along with huge tracts of banana and mango plantations.
   Government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
more than 100,000 farm animals, mainly goats, cows and water
buffaloes, died in the disaster. Bodies of the animals were
floating in the inundated towns and villages, news reports said.
   In Kothapalem, only six of the village's 5,000 houses were
standing, United News of India said. The remaining were either
submerged or had been washed away.
   ``The villagers were so dazed that they did not even rush to
collect the food packets dropped from air force helicopters,'' it
said.
   ``The people of Kothapalem were seen trying to extricate their
valuables and utensils from the heaps of rubble which once formed
their homes and hearths.
   ``They now live with only the clothes they wear,'' United News
said.
   The village is in Guntur district, which alone accounted for 215
deaths.
   At least 510 people died in Andhra Pradesh state, and 10 people
died in neighboring Tamil Nadu state.
   Relief officials said 6.5 million people had been affected by
the storm, which at its peak tore into Andhra Pradesh with winds up
to 155 mph.
   The destruction was worse than that caused by a 1977 cyclone
that killed 10,000 people.
   Officials credited early satellite warnings and evacuations with
keeping the death toll low compared to 1977.
   Most of the casualties occurred when houses, mostly made of mud
and palm thatch, collapsed.

<HEAD>Study: Most Teen-Agers Outgrow Personality Troubles in 2 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolescents with personality disturbances
serious enough to be considered disorders usually are just going
through ``a phase'' and outgrow them in a couple years, a study
presented to psychiatrists suggests.
   Another researcher called the findings a ``hopeful statement''
for exasperated parents of teen-agers.
   The study was presented Monday to the annual meeting of the
American Psychiatric Association by David Bernstein, a psychologist
at the Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Mount
Sinai School of Medicine.
   He cautioned that for other youths with personality
disturbances, the troubles can be an early warning of long-standing
difficulties. So, he said, parents should consider getting the
adolescent evaluated by a mental health professional if personality
problems appear persistent.
   The researchers focused on 10 types of personality disorder:
   _ Paranoid, a tendency to view the actions of others as
deliberately demeaning or threatening.
   _ Schizoid, in which a person neither wants nor enjoys close
relationships, and often appears cold and aloof.
   _ Schizotypal, a pervasive pattern of peculiarities in thoughts
and behavior such as superstitiousness, bizarre fantasies and
preoccupations.
   _ Histrionic, which involves excessive emotionality and
attention-seeking.
   _ Narcissistic, which includes a grandiose sense of
self-importance, extreme sensitivity to criticism and inability to
recognize how other people feel.
   _ Borderline, an instability in self-image, mood and
relationships with others.
   _ Avoidant, a pervasive pattern of discomfort in social
settings, timidity and extreme fear of disapproval.
   _ Dependent, which involves submissive behavior in a variety of
contexts.
   _ Obsessive-compulsive, a pattern of perfectionism and
inflexibility in a variety of contexts.
   _ Passive-aggressive, a pervasive tendency to resist meeting
social and business obligations by such indirect means as
procrastination or claiming to forget do to things.
   Such traits appear in many healthy people, but can become a
disorder if they form an inflexible pattern that significantly
interferes with social or occupational functioning, or causes the
person distress.
   The study included 776 participants drawn from two New York
counties. They were interviewed initially at ages 9 to 19, and
again two years later.
   Researchers found that 17 percent could be diagnosed with at
least one disorder, including about one-third of 13-year-olds.
   But of the diagnosable participants, 59 percent were free of any
personality diagnosis two years later.
   Only 39 percent of participants diagnosable for
passive-aggressive disorder in the initial interview met criteria
for that disorder two years later, and the other disorders were
even less persistent.
   Bernstein did the research with colleague Dr. Larry Siever and
Patricia Cohen and her colleagues at the New York State Psychiatric
Institute.
   The study's results do not mean that adolescent problems can be
ignored, cautioned Dr. Daniel Offer, director of the Center for the
Study of Adolescence at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center
in Chicago.
   ``You have to take adolescent problems seriously, some do grow
out of it and some don't, and you never know who will and who
won't,'' he said.
   If the troubles are serious and affecting more than one area of
an adolescent's life, a mental health professional should be
consulted, he said.
   Offer also said he thinks two years is too brief to be sure the
problems are truly gone.
   But he said the findings constitute a ``hopeful statement.''
   ``So many parents have so many negative experiences with
teen-age children and they're so pessimistic that I think it's nice
to have that kind of statement,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl indicated today
that elections for a united German government could be held as soon
as December.
   On Sunday, however, he suffered a devastating loss in state
elections and lost control of the upper house of parliament to the
opposition Social Democrats, eroding his power to dictate the terms
and timing of German unification.
   Kohl suffered another setback over the weekend when experts from
both Germanys failed to agree on key aspects of unification.
   The chancellor flew to West Berlin later today for talks with
East German Premiere Lothar de Maiziere. The two men were expected
to discuss the pace of unification.
   Asked whether there could be all-German elections this year,
Kohl said today he was ``standing by'' West German federal
elections on Dec. 2. But he also said ``there are discussions'' in
East Germany about holding all-German elections this year.
   Kohl said he thought is was important to discuss the issue ``if
that is what's desired.''
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Kohl was signaling that he did not exclude the possibility of
all-German elections before year's end.
   Kohl was scheduled to meet this evening with de Maiziere for
their first formal talks on the increasingly tense unification
process.
   On Sunday, his Christian Democrats suffered defeats in two key
states _ North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony.
   The victories by the Social Democratic Party gave Kohl's
opponents control of the Bundesrat, the upper house of West
Germany's Parliament.
   The lower house, the Bundestag, is the main lawmaking body. The
Bundesrat acts only as a ratifying body for laws passed by the
Bundestag.
   But Kohl's loss of seats could cause complications for his goal
of quick unification. The upper house no longer will be expected to
rubber stamp legislation needed for quick unification.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats have been trying to put the
brakes on Kohl's push for swift unification, which they say
threatens the jobs and pocketbooks of Germans in both countries.
   By capturing the upper house of parliament, the Social Democrats
will have more influence over the pace of unification. The vote
also strengthens their bid to unseat Kohl in national elections in
December.
   The East German Social Democrats said in a statement today the
election outcome means ``the influence of Social Democratic
policies on the unity process has become distinctly greater because
of the election outcome.''
   ``The social fears of people in both parts of Germany may no
longer be ignored,'' the statement said.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of West Germany's Social Democrats, said
late Sunday the governing party's losses were a sign Kohl was
suffering for not taking into account West German concerns over
unification.
   Many West Germans fear they will pay for the hundreds of
billions of marks needed to bail out the East German economy.
   Kohl called the results a ``disappointing defeat'' and
acknowledged it may have been generated in part by ``uncertainty''
over unification costs.
   He accused the leftists of waging a ``fear campaign.''
   The election losses came amid another jolt for Kohl _ the
failure of a team of experts from both Germanys to agree on key
aspects of unification.
   Late Saturday, delegations from both Germanys completed the
draft of a treaty that is to serve as the basis for the economic,
currency and social union of the countries by July 2.
   Dieter Vogel, spokesman for Kohl, said one of the touchiest
unification issues _ whether to allow West Germans to buy up East
German property _ has been put on the back burner.
   ``Negotiations will be continued this week on a political
level,'' he said in Bonn Sunday.
   The failure to agree on how to transfer East Germany's
state-owned property and industries to the private sector indicates
de Maiziere is reluctant to allow West German interests to buy up
East Germany's vast state-owned holdings.
   De Maiziere, like Kohl, favors a quick shift to a free market
and fast unification.
   But he has been under pressure from East Germany's Social
Democrats, who are part of his governing coalition, to seek more
social guarantees for East Germans and slow the pace of talks.
   West German Social Democrats have warned that unification has
not been properly thought out and could lead to unemployment,
weakening of the West German mark and inflation.
   Specifics of the economic agreement reached this past weekend
were not released, but they likely will flesh out details of how
West Germany's currency will become the currency of East Germany
this summer.
   West Germany had agreed earlier to trade East German marks for
West German marks at a 1-to-1 rate for salaries, pensions and small
savings accounts.
   The West German newspaper Welt am Sonntag also reported on
Sunday that West Germany agreed to provide more social guarantees
to students and elderly people.

<HEAD>Levinger Carried to Prison Gates on Shoulders of Supporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a founder of the Jewish
settlement movement, was carried on the shoulders of hundreds of
armed supporters to an Israeli prison today to begin a five-month
sentence for killing a Palestinian.
   The settlers sang the anthem of the settlement movement ``Am
Israel Chai,'' which is Hebrew for ``The Jewish People Live.'' Many
waved Israeli flags and some raised loaded assault rifles in the
air.
   Levinger pled guilty to death by negligence in the shooting of a
Hebron shoestore owner on Sept. 30, 1988. He was originally charged
with manslaughter, but the charges were reduced in a plea bargain.
He was sentenced on May 1.
   According to witnesses, Levinger fired indiscriminately after
Palestinian youths stoned his car. The victim, Kayed Sallah, 42,
was hit in his stomach as he stood before his shop.
   Levinger and other radical settlers in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip have charged that the army is not doing enough to
protect them against Palestinian stone-throwers.
   ``I'm going to prison because of the army's failure to provide
security,'' Levinger, who lives in Hebron, told the Yediot Ahronot
daily today.
   He demanded that former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin be jailed
instead of him for failing to crush the 29-month Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Speaking to cheering supporters before entering prison today,
Levinger said: ``We are not gathered here because of me but because
of the nation.''
   Shortly after being admitted to prison, Levinger complained of
not feeling well and was examined at nearby Meir Hospital, said
Prison spokeswoman Shulamit Meiri. Doctors said Levinger was well
enough to serve his term and ordered him returned to prison, Mrs.
Meiri said.
   Levinger is only the second settler to be sentenced to prison
for killing a Palestinian since the uprising began. The Israeli
Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories
reported 29 Palestinians killed by settlers.
   At least 685 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in
the uprising and another 212 have been slain by fellow Arabs for
apparently colaborating with Israeli authorities. At least 43
Israelis have been slain.
   Levinger, a leader of the religious nationalist Gush Emunim, or
Bloc of the Faithful, established a 200-member settlement in Hebron
shortly after Israel captured it in the 1967 Middle East war.

   A cancellation marking and envelope
bearing the likenesses of Mount St. Helens and Harry Truman will be
Ivydale's tribute to the native son who died in the volcano's
eruption a decade ago.
   The 84-year-old Truman was the only resident who refused to
leave the slopes of the mountain in Washington state before it blew
its top May 18, 1980.
   Ivydale postmaster Mary Lou Douglas came up with the idea of
honoring Truman, who was born here in 1896 and moved to Washington
with his parents in 1908.
   The envelope pictures Mount St. Helens spewing a plume of smoke
that outlines Truman's profile. The cancellation carries the
volcano's likeness.
   Julie Perdue, a sophomore at Clay County High School, did the
artwork. Perdue was only five when Mount St. Helens erupted, but
she remembers news coverage of Truman.
   ``That guy got killed because he wouldn't get off. He was quite
a character,'' she said. ``He sure cussed a lot.''

   President Bush is still concerned about what
he regards as hiring quotas in a major civil rights bill pending in
Congress, but hopes for changes that will make the measure
acceptable, his spokesman said today.
   ``The president would like to sign a civil rights bill. ... We
will be working toward that end,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   He made the comments shortly before Bush sat down with black
civil rights leaders at the first of a series of three meetings
this week on the Kennedy-Hawkins Civil Rights Act of 1990, awaiting
floor action in both the House and Senate.
   The Justice Department last month raised the threat of a veto
over the quota issue. The bill would undo a series of Supreme Court
rulings last year that narrowed protections against job
discrimination that minorities had enjoyed since the 1970s. It also
would expand protection for women.
   House sponsors earlier this month adopted compromise language to
meet employers' concerns about having to defend their hiring
patterns.
   Fitzwater said there have been changes ``in the right direction.
... It appears to be moving closer to being acceptable.''
   ``The problem was that many of the provisions in the bill ended
up mandating quotas in one way or another,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said he would not repeat the veto threat at this juncture,
but said, ``We had a very serious problem with the legal assumption
that people were guilty until proven innocent. The very basic kind
of legal philosophy in this country is the opposite, that you're
innocent until proven guilty.''
   Arthur A. Fletcher, chairman of the Civil Rights Commission,
said in an interview Sunday that conservatives and the civil rights
establishment were fighting ``a battle for the president's mind.''
   Bush in April urged Congress to take less sweeping action to
undo two of the Supreme Court rulings that narrowed protection
against job discrimination.
   The civil rights measures pose a ``critical'' test for the Bush
administration, which has sought to improve relations with civil
rights organizations that were frayed during the Reagan years,
Julius Chambers, director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund,
said Sunday.
   ``The course of action being urged by the Justice Department
will drown out all the lofty rhetoric and fine-sounding speeches
that we have heard from the Oval Office,'' Chambers warned in a
speech at the University of North Carolina Law School.
   ``The toxin of veto will poison all the wells of good feeling
towards the president that have sprung up (in) the black
community,'' he said. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,
which is spearheading the lobbying effort for passage of the bill,
provided a copy of Chambers' text.
   Fletcher, in a telephone interview from Norfolk, Va., where he
was attending a college commencement, said the White House has
arranged a series of meetings this week with outside groups,
including prominent black conservatives as well as the leadership
of mainstream civil rights organizations.
   Bush also has a Rose Garden ceremony planned for Thursday to
honor Fletcher and other members of the recently reconstituted
Civil Rights Commission, mired in controversy for much of the
Reagan administration and nearly killed off by Congress last year.
   Fletcher, a moderate Republican and former assistant secretary
of labor in the Nixon administration, said, ``the Kennedy-Hawkins
bill is more comprehensive in my view than the administration
bill.'' He emphasized that he was speaking only for himself, not
for the Civil Rights Commission.
   He said the conservatives ``do not want to authorize anything
that smacks of quotas'' in hiring. Fletcher said he does not regard
the Kennedy-Hawkins bill as requiring quotas.
   The bill would undo the Supreme Court's Patterson vs. McLean
Credit Union ruling, which narrowed the ability of minorities to
win monetary damages for job discrimination.
   It would also restore the burden of proof to defendants in cases
where employers' hiring practices had a discriminatory impact.
Under a 1971 ruling in the case Griggs vs. Duke Power Co., the
employers had the burden of proving their hiring practices were
required by business necessity. The high court, in a case called
Wards Cove Packing Co. vs. Atonio, undid that last year.
   Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, claimed that the recent adoption of compromise
language in the House Education and Labor Committee on the burden
of proof has expanded bipartisan support for the civil rights bill
_ and increased the administration's anxiety.
   ``At least a two-thirds majority supports the bill in both
houses,'' Neas said. The bill was approved by the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee 11-5 last month and by the House labor
panel 23-10 on May 9.

   Jordanian troops and riot police
Monday tossed tear gas and smoke bombs at demonstrators to stop
them from crossing into the Israeli-occupied West Bank during a
pro-Palestinian march.
   ``There was nothing else for us to do,'' a riot policeman on the
scene said. ``We had to stop them by force.''
   The 2,500 protesters included scores of Palestinians deported
after Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war. They
broke away from a larger group of more than 20,000 marchers.
   Hospital sources said at least 103 people were injured when the
march, called to promote Arab-Israeli peace and an independent
Palestinian state, turned violent.
   Interior Minister Salem Masadeh put the injury toll at only 52.
There no immediate explanation for the difference in figures given
by the government and hospitals.
   ``Some elements, probably due to ignorance, have succeeded in
ruining this march and its peaceful image for the good cause of the
Palestinians,'' Masadeh said in a telephone interview.
   Police fired machine guns in the air to disperse the
demonstrators, while the army tossed tear gas canisters from six
tanks.
   Ambulances raced to the scene amid exploding smoke bombs and
tear gas to evacuate the casualties to Shuna Hospital, five miles
north of the King Hussein-Allenby Bridge.
   Some of the injured appeared to have broken limbs. A few were
bleeding after being trampled when hysterical crowds ran in all
directions.
   Most of casualties were unconscious after inhaling too much gas,
said Shuna Hospital sources, insisting on anonymity. They reported
no gunshot wounds.
   The barrage lasted about 1{ hours, and many teen-agers were seen
throwing stones at the tanks and the policemen.
   It was not clear if any of the estimated 700 policemen or 300
soldiers were injured.
   The army and police had instructed the crowd to stop 700 yards
from the bridge over the Jordan River to avoid antagonizing the
Israelis on the other side.
   But when the demonstrators arrived at that point after a
one-hour walk from Hajjaj City, three miles to the north, some
2,500 demonstrators broke away and tried to run toward the wooden
bridge.
   The ground was scattered with Palestinian flags, portraits of
Palestinian figures and anti-American and anti-Israeli banners
waved during the march.
   The march was organized by 120 Arab unions and professional
associations to mark the 42nd anniversary of the United Nations'
partition plan that sliced British-mandated Palestine into Jewish
and Arab states.
   The participants included Jordanian citizens, Arab trade
unionists, Jordanian Parliament members as well as Palestinians.
   Roughly half of Jordan's 3.1 million people come from
Palestinian families who fled or were driven out during the 1948
and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars.
   The demonstrators waved banners saying, ``America is the head of
the snake.'' Other slogans read: ``America is the number one enemy
of the Arabs as it is the strategic ally of the cancerous Zionist
entity.''
   The crowd chanted ``We want an independent Palestine state amd
homes to shelter our childrens,'' as well as Palestinian songs.
   Many waved the Palestinian flag and portraits of Khalil
al-Wazir, who was deputy commander of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. He was killed by a commando unit, widely believed to
be Israeli, in April 1988.

<HEAD>Taiwan Military Reportedly to Patrol Seas When Democracy Ship
Leaves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan will send fighter planes and naval
ships to patrol local waters when the radio ship Goddess of
Democracy leaves port to beam pro-democracy messages to China,
local media reported Monday.
   Military officials quoted by the liberal Independence Morning
Post and other newspapers reiterated pledges to protect the ship in
Taiwan waters. But Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun said there would
be no escort once the vessel reaches international waters to begin
the broadcasts.
   The reports appeared one day after China again accused Taiwan of
supporting the ``illegal activities'' of the ship. Beijing has
refused to rule out the use of force to stop the broadcasts.
   Organizers of the Goddess of Democracy's trip said it would head
for international waters Thursday. It is three days behind schedule
because of difficulty obtaining Taiwan customs approval to bring
broadcasting equipment on board.
   The ship, sponsored by a coalition of French news organizations,
docked at the northern port of Keelung on Sunday. It remained in
the harbor Monday to refuel and take on water and other supplies.
   The Goddess of Democracy is named after the statue erected by
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in Beijing last
May. It was destroyed during the June 4 military crackdown that
left hundreds, perhaps thousands, of demonstrators dead.
   The broadcasts are to include a taped message from Chai Ling,
one of the student leaders wanted by Chinese authorities for
leading the pro-democracy protests in Beijing.
   Ms. Chai, who escaped to France this year after 10 months in
hiding in China, will appeal to the Beijing leadership not to
suppress the people's desire for democracy, said Hong Kong
journalist Nancy Li.
   China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, ``thought we wanted him
to be killed,'' Ms. Li quoted Ms. Chai as saying. ``But all we
wanted was to live a better life. We just wanted to ask him:
`Aren't you interested in letting people have a better life?'''
   Ms. Li, who plans to board the ship to help broadcast, said the
programs also will tell Chinese people about the protests that have
toppled communist regimes in Eastern Europe.
   ``It will be good for the Chinese people to know there were
other ways to handle protests,'' she said.
   Project organizers have expressed concern that authorities will
refuse to let prominent Chinese dissident Yan Jiaqi, who arrived in
Taiwan last week, board the ship to make broadcasts. Local
newspapers also said the government will not allow broadcasters
recruited in Taiwan to participate.
   Taiwan's Nationalist government has refused to support the
vessel, saying its plan to make unauthorized broadcasts is a
violation of international law. Taiwan officials say the ship will
not be allowed to return to refuel in Taiwan if it goes ahead with
its plans.
   The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to Communist forces in mainland China. While the two
sides remain technically at war, indirect trade and civilian
contacts have increased greatly in recent years.

   The White House said today that efforts to
strike a budget deal with Congress, a pact that Chief of Staff John
Sununu says could include tax increases, will take ``weeks if not
months.''
   ``I look for this to be a longer process rather than a shorter
process,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said on the eve
of the first budget summit session.
   Fitzwater said that Bush will kick off Tuesday's 2 p.m. meeting
in the White House with ``opening remarks certainly welcoming the
group and applauding their coming together to help solve this
important problem.''
   ``After that, the fun starts,'' Fitzwater added.
   He said Bush has ``points he wants to make'' at the opening
meeting. ``He'll have general goals about getting the deficit
down.''
   However, Fitzwater said, Bush would not lay down an opening
proposal as such.
   Bush planned to meet today with Budget Direct Richard G. Darman
and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to help prepare himself for the
budget talks. Meanwhile, Darman was to meet with House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., ``to work out meeting procedures,''
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said that budget negotiators would meet as frequently
as daily until agreement was reached. But, he added, ``It will go
on probably weeks if not months. It is not the kind of thing where
anybody expects to run in and throw a proposal on the table and
vote on it.''
   ``It's going to be painstakingly worked out sentence by sentence
and debate by debate over a longer period of time.''
   Fitzwater would not discuss the possibility that the budget
summit might result in tax increases, even though Sununu said on
Sunday that tax increases were ``a possibility but no certainty.''
   But, while not commenting on Sununu's words, Fitzwater said: ``I
can assure you that President Bush has the highest confidence in
John Sununu and is delighted with the quality of his work.''
   ``It is a budget summit, not a tax summit,'' Sununu said Sunday
as he sought to calm the storm over his earlier remarks indicating
that President Bush had no intention of deviating from his
no-new-taxes campaign pledge.
   The chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees indicated
Sunday that gun-shy Democrats will insist that Bush take the lead
in proposing any tax increases.
   Rep. Leon E. Panetta, chairman of the House Budget Committee,
said if there are any tax increases in the final package, it will
be because Bush wants them there.
   ``I can assure you that the issue of taxes are not going to be
raised or discussed or approved unless the president thinks that
they're necessary for deficit reduction,'' Panetta said on CBS'
``Face the Nation.''
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said he did not intend to be the first to suggest
raising taxes ``and I don't think the Democrats will.''
   Bush ``would have to propose revenues. ... And the president
would have to help sell those revenues to the Congress and to the
American people,'' Sasser said on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley.''
   Sununu, who appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' told reporters
last week that it was the Democrats' prerogative to put tax
increases on the bargaining table ``and it's our prerogative to say
no.''
   Sununu said Sunday that reporters had mistakenly assumed ``that
there would be taxes ... in a final budget. The fact is, there's no
preconditions means there's a possibility but no certainty.''
   Richard Darman, the White House budget director, said, ``we
shouldn't consider a tax increase independently of major budget
process reform.''
   Darman, speaking on the Brinkley show, said Bush would like to
emerge from the summit with line-item veto authority _ the ability
to kill spending on specific projects or programs without striking
down an entire appropriations bill.
   Darman said a realistic goal for the negotiators is finding
budget savings of $45 billion to $55 billion in the first year.
Darman warned last week the deficit for fiscal 1991 could run as
much as $100 billion over the $64 billion allowed by Gramm-Rudman.
   ``It's not going to be sensible to try to contract that much in
one year,'' said Darman. ``But let's say $50 billion.''

<TEXT>
   The superpowers are about to commit an act
they've tried mightily to avoid throughout 45 years of Cold War: an
intercontinental nuclear exchange.
   This one, though, will be friendly.
   Nuclear missiles of the type the United States and the Soviet
Union had aimed across the East-West divide _ but are now
withdrawing _ are to be propped up, painted and polished, side by
side, in museums in Washington and Moscow.
   It's a small sign of fast-changing times in which military
competition is lessening and new symbols of superpower cooperation
are replacing Cold War confrontation.
   A Soviet SS-20 and an American Pershing 2 _ minus their nuclear
warheads _ will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution's
National Air and Space Museum. They'll stand in the Milestones of
Flight gallery, amid such aviation icons as the 1903 Wright
brothers original flier, the Spirit of St. Louis and a replica of
Sputnik 1, the Soviet satellite that was the first manmade object
placed in Earth's orbit.
   A separate exhibit in the museum's Space Hall will display
pictures of the missiles; copies of the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces, or INF, treaty, which governs destruction of the missiles
and their launchers, and chunks of destroyed INF missiles.
   The Space Hall exhibit will be titled ``Do Veri, No Pro Veri.''
The Russian proverb, meaning ``trust, but verify,'' was
then-President Reagan's favorite way of describing the central
message of the INF treaty he signed Dec. 7, 1987.
   The exhibit opens June 20. A similar display is due to open at
Moscow's Central Armed Forces Museum, the city's main military
museum, sometime this summer.
   On Thursday, a team of American officials will arrive in Moscow
to swap a disarmed Pershing 2 for the SS-20 that will be shipped in
five pieces to the Smithsonian. Later this month, Soviet
technicians are to fly to Washington to assemble the SS-20, whose
54-foot length will barely fit inside the museum. The slimmer,
lighter, faster and more modern Pershing 2 is 34 feet long.
   Smithsonian officials had wanted the missiles in place by the
time Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in Washington
May 30 for a summit meeting with President Bush, said Gregg Herken,
chairman of the museum's space history department.
   But bureaucratic obstacles set back the original schedule, and
Herken said it was not certain whether the exhibit would be
finished before Gorbachev leaves June 3.
   ``It's possible we'll be assembling the SS-20 here while the
summit is going on,'' he said, adding that it will be the first
Soviet missile ever displayed at the Smithsonian.
   Herken acknowledged that the exhibit is a departure from the Air
and Space Museum's usual practice of showcasing peaceful advances
in technology and human accomplishment. He said the museum wanted
to commemorate not the missiles themselves but the landmark
agreement that brought about their destruction.
   ``That is an icon of human achievement,'' he said.
   The SS-20 is the main Soviet missile being destroyed under terms
of the INF treaty, which banned all U.S. and Soviet land-based
nuclear missiles with ranges of 310 to 3,410 miles. The American
missiles in this category are the Pershing 2 and Tomahawk
ground-launched cruise missiles deployed in five European NATO
countries.
   The SS-20, which Moscow began deploying in 1979, carries three
nuclear warheads with a total destructive power of 750 kilotons,
the equivalent of 750,000 tons of TNT. That is about 50 times more
powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945.
   The single-warhead Pershing 2 carried a 50-kiloton warhead and
was deployed in West Germany starting in 1983.
   The idea for exchanging INF missiles and putting them on public
display began with two Air and Space Museumcurators, Frank Winter
and Paul Ceruzzi, who noticed a 1988 newspaper article on the INF
treaty that said both sides would be allowed to keep up to 15
disarmed missiles for ``static display.''
   Herken said that before the slippage in the exhibit schedule he
had tried to interest the Bush administration in using the missile
display during the summit as a backdrop for a joint appearance by
the leaders. Herken said the White House seemed willing but
unofficial word was that the Kremlin wouldn't go along.
   ``We understand privately that Gorbachev doesn't want to be
photographed next to a missile,'' he said.

   Mayor David Dinkins condemned ``eye for an eye''
violence after a gang of blacks attacked three Vietnamese they
mistook for Koreans, fracturing one man's skull blocks from a black
boycott of two Korean stores.
   The attack in Brooklyn early Sunday was the latest in a string
of incidents that have heightened racial tensions in the city.
   ``An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, will leave us all
toothless and blind,'' the mayor said in his second appeal for
racial calm since Friday.
   The Vietnamese men were set upon by 10 to 15 blacks shouting
anti-Korean slurs, authorities said. Tuan Ana Cao, 36, was hit with
a baseball bat and was in guarded condition today with a skull
fracture at Kings County Hospital.
   Police announced early this afternoon that there had been one
arrest, but gave no details pending a news conference later.
   Initially, authorities said it appeared the attack began as a
robbery attempt and escalated into racial violence, but Cao said no
robbery attempt occurred before the attack. Police said there
apparently had been a misunderstanding.
   A few blocks from the site of the attack, two Korean-American
grocery stores have been boycotted by blacks since Jan. 18, when a
black woman allegedly was roughed up by personnel in one of the
stores after she refused to let them look in her purse.
   As the mayor spoke Sunday, two juries in Brooklyn were
deliberating charges against two young white men accused of
murdering a black 16-year-old who had entered the mostly white
Bensonhurst section to look at a used car Aug. 23.
   The juries resumed deliberations this morning.
   Cao told police someone threw a bottle through a window and that
he and two other Vietnamese went outside to see what was going on
and saw 10 to 15 blacks, one of them yelling anti-Korean slurs and
shouting, ``Get out of America!''
   The gang attacked the men and fled before police arrived.
   Cao, interviewed by New York Newsday at the hospital Sunday,
said he heard shouts of, ``Kill him! Kill the Koreans! Kill the
Chinese! Go back home!'' He said he was shocked by the brutality of
the attack, adding in halting English, ``I don't understand.''
   Cao said he was unable to see much because his glasses were
broken during the beating.
   The mayor visited Cao at the hospital and called for legislation
to increase penalties for mob violence. He also asked business,
religious and civic leaders to help quell the unrest.
   Cao said he had been mugged four times in the neighborhood, but
there was no robbery preceding the attack as police initially
reported. Police said the erroneous report may have come about
because Cao was disoriented because of his injuries or had been
misunderstood by an interpreter.
   Officers plan to reinterview Cao as his condition improves, said
Officer Kim Royster, a police spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people, including President
Francois Mitterrand and survivors of the Holocaust, marched
silently through Paris tonight, protesting the recent desecrations
of Jewish cemeteries.
   Many wore yellow Stars of David.
   The march initially was organized in response to vandalism last
week at a cemetery in the southern town of Carpentras, where tombs
were smashed and a recently buried body dug up and mutilated.
Another desecration was discovered early today at a cemetery near
Paris, where obscenities and swastikas were painted in red on more
than 30 tombs.
   Mitterrand's presence _ not announced in advance _ was believed
to mark the first time since World War II that a French president
had joined a public demonstration.
   Premier Michel Rocard, Chief Rabbi Joseph Sitruk and Roman
Catholic Cardinal Albery Decourtray were among the throng of
marchers who left from the the Place de la Republique. Rocard said
he wanted to help show the world that France's ``true image'' was
one of tolerance.
   At the request of Jewish leaders, the country's six largest TV
networks agreed to broadcast tonight ``Night and Fog,'' a
documentary about Nazi death camps.
   The coalition of Jewish groups organizing the procession asked
that marchers display only authorized banners and posters with the
slogan: ``No to racism. No to anti-Semitism.''
   Leaders of every major political party except the extreme-right
National Front urged supporters to participate, as did human rights
groups and many major labor unions.
   Police meanwhile appealed for witnesses to assist in their
investigation of the desecration in Carpentras. Five skinheads were
released after being questioned about the crime.
   The desecration there provoked outrage across France.
   In Haifa, Israel, over the weekend, about 300 graves were
spray-painted with anti-Jewish slogans, and police said a Jew from
a nearby town had been arrested as a suspect. Thousands of people
went to the cemetery Sunday and relatives wept at the graves of
their dead.
   In Lund, Sweden, 15 tombstones marking the graves of World War
II refugees were toppled at a churchyard cemetery during the
weekend. A church official said today the graves were not of Jews,
but that the vandalism may have been inspired by the other
desecrations.
   Police sealed off the Carpentras cemetery today without
explanation, and the widow of the man whose body was dug up
reportedly left Carpentras after having received telephoned death
threats.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe, along with other political and
human rights leaders, has accused far-right politician Jean-Marie
Le Pen of implicit responsibility in the desecration by creating an
atmosphere of racial hatred.
   Le Pen, who said in an interview today the government was
providing him with bodyguards, once termed the Nazi gas chambers
``a detail'' of history. His National Front favors the expulsion of
Moslem immigrants from North Africa.
   Rocard has invited all main political parties except the
National Front to participate Wednesday in a conference on
immigration. In a letter made public Saturday, Rocard appealed to
invited parties to put aside partisan interests and forge a common
stand on the issue.
   Bernard Deleplace, secretary-general of France's largest union
of policemen, urged off-duty officers to join the Paris protest,
even though officers not supposed to engage in political
demonstration.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Effect Can Disrupt Agriculture Without Raising
Temperatures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The build-up of carbon dioxide and other
gases in the atmosphere will disrupt agriculture even if it doesn't
produce a significant temperature rise, a researcher said Monday.
   Many researchers believe that the carbon dioxide build-up from
use of fossil fuels and destruction of forests will raise
temperatures at least several degrees during the next few decades.
   Some researchers dispute that, however. Their view has been used
by the Bush administration to justify a wait-and-see response to
the so-called greenhouse effect.
   Fakhri Bazzaz, a Harvard University biologist, argued at a
Rockefeller Foundation symposium on agricultural research that the
carbon dioxide build-up will have a direct effect on farms and
forests even if it doesn't raise temperatures.
   ``The cornfields in Illinois are not independent of the fate of
the tropical forests,'' he said.
   While researchers might disagree over the temperature effects of
the carbon dioxide build-up, no one disagrees about the carbon
dioxide build-up itself.
   Several decades of research have shown that carbon dioxide
already has increased substantially and is continuing to increase,
researchers say.
   Bazzaz, who has grown plants in enclosures with air rich in
carbon dioxide, has found that the plants grow faster, but that
their leaves may be less nutritious.
   Leafy vegetables eaten by humans may change their chemistry so
much that they will become unpalatable, he said.
   The accelerated growth of plants in response to increased carbon
dioxide might seem beneficial, but that means increases in weed
growth as well as crop growth, he said.
   Plants will grow faster only if they get more nutrients from the
soil along with the increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, he
said.
   In some circumstances, weeds may be more easily able to overcome
crops because the weeds will respond better to the increased carbon
dioxide.
   Because the plants' leaves will contain less nitrogen, insects
will have to eat more of the leaves to get the nutrients they need.
Thus, crop losses to insects may increase, Bazzaz said.
   Plants will decompose more slowly, his experiments show, so it
will take longer for nutrients to be replaced in the soil.
   These observations mean that it might be necessary to increase
the use of fertilizers and pesticides, he said.
   In natural areas such as tropical rain forests, the complex
relationships among different species will change, leading some to
dominate and others to become extinct, he said.
   One possibly beneficial effect is that plants may be able to
survive with less watering or less rainfall.
   The point of all these findings, he said, is that ``there are a
lot of uncertainties here. There is a great need for more
research.''
   Simple predictions that increased carbon dioxide will lead to
more rapid plant growth and thus benefit agriculture are naive, he
said. Much more must be learned about the response of individual
plants and entire ecosystems to the changes, he said.
   However, that does not justify government inaction, he said.
``The notion that we don't know enough _ let's wait for more
research _ is not a good one. We need immediate action.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today
rejected independence moves by Latvia and Estonia, declaring the
measures illegal.
   In presidential decrees read on the nightly news program
``Vremya,'' Gorbachev said Latvia's May 4 declaration of
independence and Estonia's March 30 declaration that it was an
occupied country violated Soviet law and the constitution.
   He did not indicate what he would do to counter the independence
measures.
   The Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were forcibly
annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Lithuania declared its independence March 11, and the Kremlin
responded by imposing an economic blockade on the republic.
   Latvia and Estonia passed more cautious measures, allowing for
an unspecified transition period to independence, but Gorbachev's
response showed their moves were equally unacceptable.
   The presidential decrees, in legal language and read by an
announcer, listed which points of the law and constitution the
Estonian and Latvian measures violated.
   Gorbachev rebuked the republics, saying Estonia had acted
``without having consulted with the people of the republic,
ignoring its existing economic, political, cultural and legal
ties,'' with the Soviet Union. He Latvia also had ``gone against
the rights and interests of other subjects of the Soviet
federation.''
   Gorbachev said Latvia's decree was ``invalid from the moment of
its passage'' and issued a similar ruling about the Estonian
measure.
   His announcement came a day after Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis said the three Baltic leaders had sent a letter to
Gorbachev and President Bush, asking them ``to take our problem
into their hearts.''
   He declined to release the text of what he called ``a diplomatic
communication'' but said the Baltic leaders also asked Gorbachev to
meet with them.
   The presidents of the three republics met Saturday to
re-establish a 56-year-old political bloc and form a united front
in their bid for secession from the Soviet Union.
   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, returning from a
16-day tour of Western capitals, told reporters in Moscow Sunday
that she would propose that the republic's parliament suspend laws
implementing its March 11 declaration of independence.
   Mrs. Prunskiene also said she believed she had gained ``de facto
recognition'' of her breakaway republic from Western governments
during her trip abroad. Traveling as a private citizen, she met in
the United States with Bush, and with leaders in Canada, France,
Britain and West Germany.
   Although she was warmly received, the West in general has
adopted a cautious attitude toward the situation in Lithuania, not
wanting to cause more problems for Gorbachev as he wrestles with
domestic reform.
   Mrs. Prunskiene said Lithuania was prepared to suspend those of
its new laws that concern Moscow most as a pre-condition for talks,
and expected the Kremlin to lift its economic blockade of the
republic of 3.8 million.
   The Kremlin's economic sanctions have caused an energy shortage
and resulted in the layoffs of 12,000 workers, according to
official reports.

   Homer Simpson, the boneheaded cartoon
dad on TV's ``The Simpsons'' may be the nation's best-known nuclear
plant worker, and he has a solid core of fans at the San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station.
   Homer is to San Onofre employees what Jackie Gleason was to bus
drivers when ``The Honeymooners'' show was big _ someone in their
shoes but whose shoes they would hate to be in.
   ``Homer is my hero. He could work here,'' San Onofre engineer Al
Meichler said last week.
   ``Homer sounds like a candidate for upper management,'' said
Richard Rice, a nuclear chemistry foreman.
   Maintenance machinist Pat Daugherty added: ``In the protected
area, there's about five guys in there just like him.''
   But Southern California Edison Co., which owns the plant on the
San Diego County coast, says Homer wouldn't qualify.
   ``The people we hire are pretty high-quality in terms of
intellectual ability,'' said Edison spokesman Dave Barron. ``Homer
Simpson couldn't get a job anywhere near here.''

   Carol Jong wanted to leave an indelible
mark on the University of Kansas.
   So she did it seven times.
   In its 103rd edition, the university's 1990 yearbook features
photos of Jong in seven different looks.
   Not under the same name, of course.
   There's Buffi J. Baker in business. Or Bertha Heffer in
engineering. Even Violet Couleur in fine arts.
   Going the extra mile, try Anne (U.) Rissom in allied health. And
Dorrie N. Collum in architecture.
   Some of the aliases were tailor-made for particular schools
while others ``just fit the stereotypes,'' Ms. Jong said.
   Ms. Jong's roommate tried to join in the prank, submitting fake
photos, but all her fakes were rejected from the yearbook, the
Jayhawker.
   ``We wanted to leave our mark at K.U.,'' said Ms. Jong, who's
graduating this year with a liberal arts degree. ``Since we're not
athletes or student presidents or anything, we wanted to be
remembered for something special.''
   The Jayhawker staff wasn't amused.
   ``I mean, it's a great joke as far as she's concerned,'' said
Jeannine Kreker, assistant editor. ``But as far as Kansas alumni
and everybody who's going to look at this book years from now is
concerned, it makes us and the university look pretty silly.''
   Not all of Ms. Jong's fakes made it: There's no Penny Sylan in
pharmacy.

   The staff at the West Overton Museum
didn't think people would miss it when they retired one of the
oddities on display _ a two-headed calf.
   The heads, mounted on a board after the calf was born in 1922,
had been displayed from 1930 to 1987 at the museum, which
specializes in exhibits of farm and industrial implements used in
southwestern Pennsylvania.
   Over the years, the relic was popular with museum-goers,
especially children who passed by other industrial and agricultural
artifacts to gape.
   Still, the staff didn't think anyone would notice when the head
was taken down and stored because it was deteriorating, said
Kimberly Bringe, the museum's director.
   They were wrong. Parents who had seen the calf as children
repeatedly asked about it and several people offered to buy the
piece.
   ``I think people are naturally attracted to oddities,'' Ms.
Bringe said. She had the display reconditioned by a taxidermist,
and it was put up for the museum's summer season opening Tuesday.
   ``It's like a shrine,'' said Ms. Bringe. ``I call it the divine
bovine.''

<TEXT>
   Howard Ross Hale, who as a Western
Union telegrapher relayed reporter H.L. Mencken's stories of the
1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, has died at age 85.
   Hale, who died Saturday, was among eight telegraphers who
transmitted stories on the trial, in which school teacher John T.
Scopes was charged with illegally teaching Darwin's theory of
evolution.
   Hale estimated the telegraphers sent about 175,000 words daily
until the 11-day trial in the sweltering Rhea County Courthouse
ended July 21, 1925.
   It wasn't until later that Hale realized he had been assigned to
handle the copy of the most famous reporter at the trial, Mencken
of The Evening Sun of Baltimore.
   ``I think I transmitted every dispatch he wrote for The Sun,''
Hale said in a 1985 intervew. ``But I didn't pay much attention to
what was in the stories.
   ``I do remember that he was critical of (defense attorney
Clarence) Darrow for popping his suspenders, and that was a little
surprising because most of his comments about Darrow were favorable.
   ``And I remember that Mencken strutted around like a big gobbler
turkey and demanded that his stories be given first priority.''
   Hale is survived by his wife, Elsie Parker Hale, four sisters
and a brother. A service is scheduled for Tuesday.

   Relatives of persons killed in the 1988
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 said Monday they hope to see tough
proposals for preventing terrorism when a presidential commission
issues its findings Tuesday.
   The report to President Bush is expected to recommend changes in
the Federal Aviation Administration's security operations and to
criticize the FAA, the State Department and Pan American World
Airways.
   The seven-member commission investigated government and airline
actions before and after the bombing, which killed all 259 people
aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 people on the ground in Lockerbie,
Scotland.
   Investigators have said the jet was downed by a plastic
explosive concealed in a cassette tape player.
   The nine-month inquiry did not address criminal aspects of the
Dec. 21, 1988, bombing or attempt to evaluate U.S. participation in
the British investigation, which has yet to produce any charges.
   Bush created the commission after relatives called for a full
congressional inquiry.
   Some relatives already have been critical of what they fear the
report will contain. Others have said they are ``cautiously
optimistic.''
   Ted Reina, whose daughter Jocelyn was a flight attendant on the
jetliner, said he was concerned the commission could send the
``right signal to terrorists and the wrong signal to the traveling
public'' if it slows FAA-mandated installation of sophisticated
bomb detectors at high-risk airports.
   Commission members have said the FAA has not adequately
encouraged other technologies.
   Paul Hudson of Albany, N.Y., whose daughter, Melina, died in the
bombing, said he hopes the commission will ask for tough security
reforms.
   Hudson, who heads one of two victims' groups, said he expects
the commission's work to lead to changes in State Department
consular affairs, which already has acknowledged mistakes in its
dealings with victims' relatives.
   Aphrodite Tsairis of Franklin Lakes, N.J., representing the
other victims' group, said, ``We are looking for a strong
indictment that says the Pan Am bombing was clearly preventable.''
   The commission, which includes four members of Congress and is
headed by former Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin, has tried to
determine whether errors by any federal agency, the airline, or
others might have allowed the bombing to occur.
   Commission investigators have said, however, that they found no
``smoking gun'' that would lead them to assess blame.
   Commission members did, during hearings, strongly criticize the
FAA and Pan Am for security flaws and the State Department for
falldowns in the notification of next of kin and return of personal
belongings to relatives.
   The commission has no enforcement powers, but has drawn up about
60 recommendations into a report of more than 150 pages, according
to staff members.
   FAA officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
expect the report to be critical of the agency, which has worldwide
responsibility for the security of U.S. airlines.
   Chairwoman McLaughlin met with Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner last week to brief him on the report, but a department
spokesman said there was no in-depth discussion and that Skinner
did not get a copy.
   A congressional source said the panel recommends a revamp of the
FAA's security office to give it higher visibility.
   The commission held five public hearings in Washington and
traveled to Europe for interviews with aviation and airline
officials in France, Germany and Britain. Flight 103 originated in
Frankfurt and switched to a different airliner in London before
leaving for New York.
   Other commission members besides McLaughlin include Sens. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Reps. James
Oberstar, D-Minn., and John Paul Hammerschmidt, D-Ark.; retired Air
Force Gen. Thomas C. Richards, and Edward Hidalgo, an attorney and
former assistant Navy secretary.

   Hey, Cybill Shepherd, lighten up. On second

   ``When I think of the classic blondes, I think of Marilyn Monroe

   It's not easy staying yellow. Shepherd recalls that she was a

   ``When my hair started getting darker in my early teens, my

   A Swedish news magazine was ordered
Monday to pay $12,500 to retired tennis star Bjorn Borg for
defaming him by reporting allegations that he used cocaine.
   The verdict and unusually stiff sentence followed the
non-binding recommendation last week of a jury to convict the
magazine ``Z'' for printing the allegations.
   The allegations were from Borg's former girlfriend, Jannicke
Bjorling, who is involved in a custody dispute with him over the
couple's son, Robin.
   A special press court also fined the monthly's editor in chief
$830 and ordered the magazine to publish an apology. Borg was to
receive $25,000 in court costs.
   Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, is still a sports hero in
Sweden though he retired from professional tennis in 1983 and
remains aloof from the public. He has been involved in four other
court cases this year related to his troubled fashion business or
gossip magazine.
   ``The verdict is extremely important for Borg. Now he can feel
that the Swedish people look up to him as the silent but strong
person he is,'' Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, told the national
news agency TT.
   The jury was instructed to ignore the issue of whether Ms.
Bjorling's accusations might be true, and to rule only on whether
the magazine should have published her unsubstantiated charges.
Borg denied that he ever used drugs.
   The magazine said it had several other sources to confirm that
Borg used drugs, but their identities were never disclosed.

   The granddaughter of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze donned a U.S. Space Camp uniform, but
said she's not sure if she would actually like to go into space.
   ``I think space travel is very interesting _ it's part of the
future,'' 11-year-old Sophia Shevardnadze said Sunday after
arriving in Huntsville.
   Sophia and seven other children from the Soviet Republic of
Georgia will spend the next week taking part in simulated space
shuttle missions aboard orbiter mockups and training on NASA
astronaut simulators.
   This is the first group of Soviet children to participate in a
weeklong program of Space Camp activities, officials said.
   Sophia was accompanied to the Space Camp by her father, Paata
Shevardnadze, and his wife, Nino Ahvlediani.
   Sophia's accommodations at the Space Camp are within walking
distance of an exhibit of American-made missiles. Her grandfather
was instrumental in negotiating the Immediate Nuclear Range Forces
Treaty that led to the elimination of the U.S. Pershing II missile.

   President Abdou Diouf of Senegal asked
President Bush for more economic assistance Monday, but the White
House indicated there was little hope of more money now for the
West Africa nation.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush told
Diouf he was sympathetic to his needs and would consider his
request but that ``we couldn't promise any more funds at this
existing time.''
   Senegal is one of the staunchest U.S. allies in Africa. Senegal
receives an average of $40 million annually and has strong cultural
ties to American organizations.
   Fitzwater said the two leaders discussed Senegal's dispute with
neighboring Mauritania. The two countries broke diplomatic
relations in August after a minor border dispute flared into
violence in both countries in which hundreds of people were killed.
   Diouf also expressed concerns that Iraq may be building a
testing site for its long-range missiles in Mauritania, Fitzwater
said.
   Although Diouf's week-long visit to Washington is being billed
as a private one, he has a full schedule of meetings _ including
talks with Treasury and Commerce Department leaders and with the
heads of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

   ``He couldn't write and the school didn't take steps to
compensate his handicap,'' said his lawyer, Rex Friend.
   Since U.S. District Judge Wayne Alley ruled in Nation's favor
two weeks ago, the university has agreed to give Nation a desk that
will accommodate his wheelchair, and to allow him twice as long to
take exams.
   The school said it also would provide him with a tape recorder
equipped so he can dictate notes during class. A school secretary
will transcribe the notes.
   Friend called the victory ``an extremely valuable precedent''
for all handicapped people.

<HEAD>Caribbean Island Focus of International Arms Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scandal over the shipment of
Israeli arms to a Colombian drug lord has become a political
bombshell in this tourist haven, where the ruling family has
weathered previous scandals.
   The island gained international notoriety in the late 1970s for
allowing the testing of weapons for South Africa. It was in the
news again in the early 1980s for harboring fugitive American
financier Robert Vesco.
   Now, Israel has accused Prime Minister Vere Bird's eldest son,
Vere Jr., 54, of ordering weapons for Antigua's 80-man army that
mysteriously ended up in the hands of Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel.
   Vere Jr., a Cabinet minister, has denied wrongdoing but resigned
his Cabinet post pending the outcome of a judicial inquiry, the
equivalent of a U.S. grand jury investigation.
   Another son of the prime minister, Lester, 52, deputy prime
minister and sometime rival of his older brother, is spearheading
the local investigation, shrugging off any possible conflict of
interest.
   The Bird family, which has dominated the island's politics for
more than three decades and grown wealthy while doing it, has long
been accused of corruption in connection with developing the
island's booming tourist industry. But this affair, with its
suggestion of a government link with the sinister world of
international drug trafficking and gunrunning, is a bombshell by
comparison.
   ``This latest one shocked us to the core,'' said Anglican
Archbishop Orland Lindsay.
   Tim Hector, a leftist opposition leader, said he thought the
nation could be in danger of a coup if the prime minister's son
were charged.
   ``I believe we are teetering on the brink ... of a possible
military seizure of power and control by Vere Bird (Jr.),'' he
said. Vere Jr. is said to command the army's loyalty.
   Last month, Israel said it had shipped weapons to the Caribbean
island in April 1989 on the understanding they would be used
exclusively by the Antigua Defense Force.
   Israel said the arms were ordered by Vere Jr., who identified
himself as the minister of national security. There is no such
ministry, but Vere Jr. does act informally as his father's national
security adviser.
   The Antiguan investigation determined that the weapons arrived
here on April 24, 1989 and were shipped the same day to Santa
Marta, Colombia.
   Colombian officials say soldiers found 232 Israeli-made weapons
in February during a search of ranches seized from Gonzalo
Rodrigues Gacha, a reputed kingpin of the Medellin cartel who was
killed in a gunbattle with police last December.
   The weapons included machine guns, submachine guns, assault
rifles, pistols, shoulder-fired rockets and infrared night scopes.
   The Outlet, a weekly newspaper published by Hector's Antigua
Caribbean Liberation Movement, said the weapons deal was arranged
by two Israelis, Maurice Sarfati and Col. Yair Klein.
   Sarfati, a former Israeli army officer, once operated a melon
farm in Antigua but went bankrupt and reportedly is being sought by
U.S. authorities for defaulting on $1.3 million in loans.
   Colombian officials have accused Klein, a reserve officer in the
Israeli army, of organizing, training and equipping paramilitary
groups, and declared him a fugitive from justice.
   Klein said in Israel that the arms shipment was originally
intended for a training school he wanted to set up in Antigua for
Panamanian rebels opposed to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was
ousted by U.S. forces last December.
   When plans for the school fell through, Klein said, the
Panamanians wanted the weapons shipped to Panama, but somehow they
were diverted to Colombia.
   Many questions remain, among them whether anyone in the Antiguan
government was aware the arms shipment was headed for Colombia.
   In Antigua, a former British colony of 80,000 only nine miles
wide and 12 miles long, the government is largely a function of one
family, the Birds.
   Vere Bird Sr., the 80-year-old prime minister, first rose to
prominence in the 1930s as a union organizer in the days of
colonial sugar plantations and has led the nation all but five of
the past 34 years. His Antigua Labor Party controls 15 of the 17
seats in Parliament.
   Vere Jr. is the minister of public works and communication.
Lester, the deputy prime minister, is also leader of the ruling
party and minister of foreign affairs, economic development,
tourism and energy.
   Antiguans take it for granted that either Lester or Vere Jr.
will succeed their father, who is in declining health, and many
believe the outcome of this scandal could help settle the matter.
   The brothers, both British-trained lawyers, have both weathered
previous scandals.
   In 1987, Vere Jr. was implicated, but never charged, in an
investigation of a government project to repave the runway of the
island's airport. He had formed a private company to carry out the
project, which was supposed to cost no more than $3.5 million but
ended up costing $11.5 million.
   It was Lester who helped Vesco when the fugitive surfaced in
Antigua in 1982 with a bizarre plan to buy half of Barbuda,
Antigua's small sister island, and establish a principality called
the Sovereign Order of New Aragon.
   Vere Jr. is widely regarded as his father's favorite. Lester,
who was an All-American long jumper at the University of Michigan
in 1960, is seen as the brighter of the two.
   In separate interviews, the brothers played down their rivalry
and the possible impact of the scandal on their political futures.
   ``I clearly had no intention of ... reducing (this matter) to a
question of a fight for power within the domestic situation,''
Lester said. ``After all, he is still my brother.''
   Vere Jr. would not discuss specifics of the case, but said:
``I've never been associated with anything of the kind and would
never be.''
   About his relationship with his brother, he said: ``Whenever I
meet him, it's a most amicable ... relationship. When we leave, I
don't know what transpires.''
   The Antigua government has hired a Washington, D.C., attorney,
E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., to head a team that has flown to Israel
to get evidence. A British jurist, Louis Blom-Cooper, has been
named to conduct a judicial inquiry, which is expected to open
hearings in June.

   Squatters protesting a shortage of housing
for the poor were arrested Monday and removed from property owned
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but said they
would return.
   ``We're planning on going back in as soon as people are
released,'' said Charles Viebahn, a spokesman for Up and Out of
Poverty, an advocacy group for the homeless. He said the sites had
been occupied since May 1.
   HUD spokeswoman Patricia Mack said department officials made
citizens arrests and removed 12 adults and four children from the
properties, one warehouse and four single-family and duplex houses.
   Police Sgt. Phil VanTassel said police observed the arrests at
HUD's request. He said no one resisted arrest.
   Mack said the adults were charged with trespassing and released.
She said HUD officials planned to remove all furnishings and other
belongings from the occupied property.
   ``Everything from milk to the beds,'' she said. ``I imagine by
now they are back out on the street or back in our houses. We don't
know. We're not standing watch outside.''
   Mack said the four children, between ages 5 and 13, were taken
temporarily to St. Joseph's Home for Children in Minneapolis while
their parents were booked.
   Viebahn said the group wants HUD to release 10 percent of its
abandoned property nationwide for use as homeless shelters run by
homeless people.
   The protesters should apply for HUD's existing housing programs
if they need places to live, Mack said. She said one of the houses
occupied by the protesters has been sold.
   ``These folks are just choosing not to come into our system,''
she said.

<TEXT>
   About 300 radical students demanding
the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo hurled firebombs and rocks at
riot police in front of a Seoul university Monday, and police
responded with tear gas.
   In Ulsan, 200 miles southeast of the capital, union leaders at
South Korea's largest carmaker announced a general strike Tuesday.
At the world's largest shipyard, also in Ulsan, workers voted to
return to their jobs.
   Both companies are subsidiaries of the Hyundai group, one of
South Korea's largest conglomerates.
   Government officials have warned they will move swiftly to crush
any illegal labor protests.On April 28, 12,000 police firing tear
gas burst into the Ulsan shipyard to crush a strike. The facility
has not reopened.
   Students at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies shouted
``Oust Roh Tae-woo!'' at police who tried to disperse the
demonstration.
   Similar anti-government protests involving several hundred
students were reported in the southern cities of Kwangju and Iri.
   It was not known whether there were any arrests or injuries.
   Students demanded that Roh's gigantic new ruling party be
disbanded and a public mandate be held on the merger, which brought
Roh's old ruling party together with two opposition groups. The
coalition was formed early this year.
   Roh's government is under mounting public fire for economic
failures that have triggered inflation and pushed up housing costs.
Roh's popularity is at an all-time low.
   Also Monday, the nation's largest opposition party demanded the
release of a prominent dissident arrested on charges he helped
organize last week's anti-government demonstrations, the largest
and most violent since 1987.
   About 100,000 militant students and dissidents joined in last
Wednesday's protests in Seoul and 16 other cities.
   The government last week warned against violence and launched a
crackdown on dissidents and radical students.
   The Party for Peace and Democracy said Kim Keun-tae, winner of
the 1987 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, was ``not involved
in recent violent demonstrations.''
   The party called on the government ``to stop immediately the
selective suppression of dissident elements.''
   Kim, 43, chairman of the executive council of the National
Alliance of Democratic Movements, was arrested at his
brother-in-law's apartment Sunday on the southern island of Cheju.
   In Ulsan, officials of the Hyundai Motor Co. threatened to file
a complaint seeking punitive actions against union leaders
organizing what they said was an ``illegal'' work stoppage.
   Hyundai Motor's walkout had been expected since Saturday, when
27,000 workers voted to strike. They said 22 rounds of talks with
management to negotiate higher pay and better working conditions
had bogged down.
   Workers of the Hyundai car plant want a 19 percent pay raise and
a cut in the work week from 44 to 42 hours. The company has offered
a 5.95 percent increase in pay. The average salary is $620 monthly.
   At the nearby shipyard, the 24,000 workers voted to start work
on Wednesday. They had been on strike to pressure the release of
jailed union leaders.

<HEAD>Woman Gets 5 Years for 18th Drunken-Driving Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INVERNESS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who has been charged with drunken
driving 18 times was sentenced Monday to a maximum five years in
prison, drawing an outraged reaction from the prosecutor.
   ``It's just disgusting,'' said Assistant State Attorney Lisa
Porter. ``It's an insult to society. ... This case is just
incredible.''
   Dollie Louise Fazekas is to begin serving the sentence after
completing a one-year term imposed last month in another county for
violating probation on a previous DUI charge. Prosecutors expected
the 46-year-old defendant to serve about 18 months of the new
sentence, counting credit for good behavior and time routinely
deducted from sentences because of prison crowding.
   During the past 15 years, she has used 14 aliases, nine Social
Security numbers and six dates of birth, according to authorities.
Last month, her driver's license was revoked for life.
   Ms. Porter concedes there is no record of anyone being injured
in three accidents listed on a six-page printout of Ms. Fazekas'
traffic record. But the relatively short prison term for such a
repeat offender shows the need for legislative reform, the
prosecutor argued.
   ``It's a problem for the people of the state of Florida,'' Ms.
Porter said, ``when you've got the Dollie Fazekases running around
in cars and no way to punish them.''

   A serviceman shot to death in the
Philippines was mourned Monday as a victim of seemingly irrational
political violence.
   On the day U.S. and Philippine negotiators began discussing the
future of American military in that country, about 450 people
gathered at the Church of the Nativity to remember Gunnery Sgt.
John Fredette, 34.
   The Most Rev. Joseph F. Maguire, urged the bereaved to abandon
thoughts of revenge and enshrine Fredette in their memories.
   ``If his goodness will go on ... then he will not have died in
vain,'' said Maguire, bishop of the Springfield diocese.
   Fredette was attacked by gunmen May 4 in a nightclub district in
Olangapo, a town 50 miles west of Manila.
   Two airmen were killed Sunday, bringing to eight the number of
U.S. servicemen killed in such attacks since April 1989.
   Philippine officials have arrested two men in connection with
Fredette's death, but there has been speculation they were not
involved. The U.S. government is investigating.
   Fredette's shooting followed threats in Philippine newspapers
that an American serviceman would be killed before the talks on
extending the leases of six U.S. military bases in the country. No
claims of responsibility were made following Fredette's shooting,
but U.S. officials believe rebels were responsible.
   Fredette's casket was carried past the Mount Carmel school,
which he once attended. He was buried in the nearby western
Massachusetts town of South Hadley.
   The bishop described Fredette as a ``vital and sparkling'' man
who was taken by ``the cruel and irrational act of violence.''
   Family members have described Fredette as an athlete and a man
dedicated to a military career.
   ``It's sad. I just want the assailants brought to justice.
That's about all we can do here,'' his brother, Mark Fredette, has
said.
   Fredette had been living in Buena Park, Calif., with his wife,
Julie. He left the United States last month for a six-month tour in
Japan, Hawaii and the Philippines.
   In addition to his wife, survivors include his parents, Armand
and Augustine Fredette of Chicopee, three brothers and five sisters.

<HEAD>Baby Sitter Who Allegedly Abducted 5-year-old Appears in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former baby sitter charged with abducting a
5-year-old girl should remain in custody until his trial on
kidnapping charges, a prosecutor argued Monday.
   Kenneth M. Cole II, 24, appeared in U.S. District Court on a
criminal complaint charging him with kidnapping. He is accused of
abducting Nicole Ravesi, and holding her for 39 days.
   FBI agents found the pair Thursday in a Florida Panhandle
fishing village.
   U.S. Magistrate Robert B. Collings scheduled a detention hearing
for Wednesday. Cole does not enter a plea until prosecutors file an
indictment.
   Cole was a former co-worker of Nicole's mother and had babysat
for the youngster after losing his job as a bus driver. Police say
he was obsessed with Nicole and snatched the girl April 3 from her
mother's car.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Martin Murphy recommended the detention
hearing ``on the grounds that no condition or combination of
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant
at trial or the safety of the individual.''
   Cole's attorneys said they had no objection to the detention
hearing.
   Cole, of Holliston, could be sentenced to life imprisonment and
a $250,000 fine if convicted.
   Collings granted a request by Cole's parents to speak with their
son briefly Monday. They declined to comment as they left the
courtroom.

   A Senate committee recommended Monday that
Anthony Hope, a lawyer and son of entertainer Bob Hope, be
confirmed as chairman of the Indian Gaming Commission.
   Hope testified last week before the Senate Select Committee on
Indian Affairs on his qualifications to become the first chairman
of the new commission, established to oversee gambling on Indian
reservations.
   A graduate of Georgetown University and Harvard Law School, Hope
was a partner in the accounting firm of Touche Ross &amp; Co. and
formerly worked for Mutual of Omaha.
   He also worked in New Hampshire for George Bush's campaigns in
1980 and 1988 and has served in management capacities for various
non-profit organizations.
   The three-year gaming commission chairmanship pays $83,600
annually.
   Hope and two other commission members, yet to be named, will
inspect gambling premises, do background checks on employees, levy
fines and enforce ordinances.
   Sen. Daniel Innouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Indian
commmittee, said he expected Hope to be quickly confirmed by the
full Senate.

   Communist rebels warned Americans
Monday to ``go home'' and police clashed with protesters as U.S.
and Philippine negotiators began talks on the future of six
American military bases in the country.
   At least 42 people were arrested and five hospitalized in Manila
as police clashed with anti-bases protesters during daylong rallies.
   The bases talks opened one day after assailants believed to be
Communist guerrillas killed two U.S. airmen near Clark Air Base, 50
miles north of Manila.
   No one claimed responsibility for the killings, but U.S. and
Philippine officials suspect the rebels. The State Department said
Monday the United States was ``shocked and saddened'' by the
murders, which it said were aimed at disrupting the talks.
   The negotiations will determine whether the United States can
retain Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller
installations after the lease expires Sept. 16, 1991.
   President Corazon Aquino has refused to say whether she supports
an extension of the lease. In December, U.S. jets from Clark helped
suppress a military revolt that nearly toppled her four-year
administration.
   During the opening session Monday, chief U.S. negotiator Richard
Armitage said the United States will remain a power in the Pacific
regardless of the outcome of the talks. They are expected to last
until the end of the year.
   Armitage, a former assistant secretary of defense, urged the
Philippines to decide whether the bases serve its defense interests.
   Armitage said that if the Philippines wants the bases closed,
``leave we shall, as expeditiously as possible and with our pride
fully intact.''
   In a sometimes caustic opening statement, Foreign Secretary Raul
Manglapus, chief Philippine negotiator, said the United States has
often fallen short of its financial commitments to the Philippines.
   He said tens of thousands of Filipinos died fighting the
Japanese in World War II ``not to save the Philippines ... but to
keep the war from reaching Australia and eventually the American
mainland.''
   ``Even before the Filipino soldier had finished fighting and
dying for America, he was judged by the American Congress to be
worth only half of the pay of the American soldier,'' Manglapus
said.
   U.S. and Philippine officials had expressed fears that the
Communist New People's Army would try to kill Americans to disrupt
the talks.
   Late Sunday, assailants shot and killed Airman John H. Raven,
19, of Delta Junction, Alaska, and Airman James C. Green, 20, of
Craig, Colo., outside a hotel near Clark. A companion, Airman 1C
Randall Moore, 23, escaped.
   They were among 280 airmen and support personnel assigned to the
8th Aircraft Generation Squadron on temporary duty from Kunsan Air
Base, 110 miles south of Seoul, South Korea.
   Police Capt. Gener Manguni said it appeared the rebels were
responsible for the killings because of the style of the attack.
Two or three Filipinos approached the Americans and shot them in
the back of their heads with .45-caliber pistols, the rebels'
favored weapon in street killings.
   On Monday, U.S. officials canceled off-post leaves for the
40,000 troops, military dependents and Defense Department civilians
at all six bases.
   In a statement to news organizations, the New People's Army
denounced the bases talks.
   ``Go home immediately or suffer the agony of attrition,'' the
rebels said. ``The NPA pledges that all its territorial and unit
commands, all officers and men, will carry out their mission _ to
the last man if necessary _ of expelling U.S. imperialism out of
our country.''
   The rebels are believed to have killed eight Americans since
April 1989.
   Most surveys show that supporters of the bases outnumber
opponents, but opposition is growing because of Filipino
nationalism and Congress' decision to cut aid to the country.
   Any new bases agreement must also be ratified by two-thirds of
the 23-member senate here, where anti-bases sentiment is strong.
   In the largest protest Monday, about 3,500 people including
workers, students and Roman Catholic nuns heard speakers denounce
the bases. They chanted ``U.S. bases, pests!'' and carried banners
urging the government to send the Americans home.
   ``Americans must be driven away,'' said Crispin Beltran,
chairman of the left-wing labor May First Movement. ``And those who
refuse must be buried here.''
   Bases opponents from Australia, New Zealand and the United
States joined the protest.
   Outside Clark, about 800 opponents of the bases hung a
``termination notice'' on the main gate as about 1,000 supporters
of the bases, mostly bar maids, shouted and jeered. Police kept the
two groups apart and there were no incidents.
   During the talks, Manglapus also raised the issue of the aid
cuts. In 1988, the Reagan administration pledged $962 million over
two years to keep the bases through 1991.
   Congress, however, cut $96 million from the Bush administration
aid request for the Philippines. Filipino officials see that as a
breach of the agreement.
   ``Dollars are important, but it is the solemn word that is here
at issue,'' Manglapus said. ``The bilateral relations of any two
nations can look forward to no significant future if no one can
count on the other's word.''
   Manglapus said the Philippines appreciated Washington's
budgetary problems but suggested the United States reduce military
spending to provide more money for aid.

<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro sent an
urgent plea to President Bush for the $300 million in aid pending
in Congress, the White House said Monday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush, in response
to Mrs. Chamorro's cable, called the speaker of the House, Rep.
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., earlier Monday to reiterate his
unhappiness with Congress' pace on the bill.
   ``The president expressed to the speaker his strong feelings
that Congress has toyed with this bill and has ignored the real
problems in Panama and Nicaragua,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Foley told Bush he would ``do his best'' to move the
legislation.
   The aid for Nicaragua, which includes money to help disband and
repatriate the Contra rebels, along with Bush's companion $500
million request for Panama, has been snarled in Congress for two
months.
   Other measures added to the legislation, ranging from space
research to grasshopper control, have increased its total price tag
to $3 billion.
   And the Senate added to the bill a veto-threatened provision to
allow the District of Columbia to pay for poor women's abortions.
   Fitzwater called congressional delay on the measure
``outrageous'' and accused Congress of turning its back on ``people
with a real crying need.''
   ``Let's get it down here and get on with the task,'' Fitzwater
said.
   In her cable to Bush, Mrs. Chamorro ``lays out a very
humanitarian plea,'' Fitzwater said.
   She expressed ``a sense of emergency'' to Bush, Fitzwater said.
   ``This democracy is having enough troubles taking over from a
communist regime, making all the adjustments in management, policy
and philosophy, without having to also face the fact that the
people are very much in need of this support and aid in terms of
everything from food, clothing, housing, all sorts of things,''
Fitzwater said.
   The request also includes money for farm equipment, seed and
fertilizer; for health and education programs; for energy
purchases, and for manufacturing equipment and spare parts.
   Fitzwater said that Mrs. Chamorro also mentioned that strikes in
her country by civil servants loyal to the old Sandinista regime
were posing ``a very serious problem'' to her two-week old
government.
   The spokesman, while renewing the administration's appeal for
congressional action on the bill, said that Bush will still veto
the measure if it arrives on his desk with the Senate abortion
provision.

<HEAD>Justices Hear, Join in Flag-Burning Arguments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court justices, setting the stage for
a decision with major political implications, joined lawyers in
spirited arguments Monday over flag burning, patriotism and freedom
of expression.
   In arguments before the justices, the Bush administration's top
courtroom lawyer, Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, argued that a
new federal law to protect Old Glory does not violate free speech
any more than a regulation limiting an outdoor loudspeaker's volume.
   Congress can protect ``those things that are special to us as a
people,'' Starr said. ``Nothing prohibits the legislature from
protecting symbols against physical attack.''
   But civil rights attorney William Kunstler said, ``Respect for
the flag must be voluntary. Once people are compelled to respect a
symbol, they are no longer free.''
   The law, the Flag Protection Act of 1989, was Congress' response
to the high court's 5-4 ruling last June that struck down a Texas
law banning flag burning and desecration.
   The court is expected to rule by late June or early July. If the
law is struck down, a proposed constitutional amendment to protect
the flag likely would become a leading issue in congressional and
state legislative races this fall.
   Outside the court Monday, demonstrators exchanged taunts and
slogans.
   Shawn Eichman, arrested last year for burning a flag here, said,
``I`m just one of the thousands of women who is taking a cold, hard
look at the system defending us. ... Women have less protection
than a flag.''
   Six opposing demonstrators carried a sign saying, ``Flag burning
is a hate crime.'' The two groups stood just feet apart as they
chanted and shouted at each other. But there was no violence.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, seen by sponsors of the federal law
as a potential swing vote, was silent throughout Monday's arguments.
   Blackmun voted last year to strike down the Texas law. But in a
1974 ruling, he indicated he might go along with some laws to
protect the flag's ``physical integrity.''
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who last June voted to invalidate the
Texas law, pounced on Starr's argument that the federal law is not
aimed at a particular viewpoint.
   ``In fact there is only one viewpoint'' expressed by flag
burners, Scalia interjected. ``I hate America.''
   ``You do not deface, defile or trample the flag to show your
love for the country,'' Scalia added as laughter filled the crowded
courtroom.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who also voted last year to strike
down the Texas law, noted demonstrators in Eastern Europe defaced
their countries' flags to protest communist regimes.
   ``Would you be concerned if Eastern European countries punished
people for demonstrating with a defaced flag?'' Kennedy asked
Starr. ``It's almost an internationally recognized form of
protest.''
   Starr said the U.S. law is acceptable because it does not single
out any particular protesters.
   Justice John Paul Stevens asked Kunstler whether it would
violate the Constitution to ban car dealers from using the flag in
advertisements ``to promote the American economy.''
   Kunstler said that would be a form of commercial speech
``unworthy of constitutional protection.''
   Outside the court, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who supported the
new law as an alternative to a constitutional amendment, said the
issue may be blunted regardless of how the court rules.
   ``The majority of the members of Congress want to protect the
flag,'' he said.
   By contrast, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said the issue is so
divisive that the House probably would reject a proposed
constitutional amendment.
   Amending the Constitution requires approval by two-thirds of the
members of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38 state
legislatures.
   While the Bush administration is defending the law, President
Bush and Republican leaders have said they would prefer a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. There would be no
need for such an amendment if the justices uphold the law.
   Democratic congressional leaders were the prime sponsors of the
Flag Protection Act.
   Starr told the justices Monday that the law does not violate
freedom-of-expression protections in the Constitution's First
Amendment.
   Justice Byron R. White said Starr appeared to be comparing flag
burning to using a loudspeaker to get public attention. ``This is
like an over-loud loudspeaker,'' White said.
   ``That is an apt analogy,'' said Starr, adding that the law is
``content neutral'' and is not aimed at limiting the flag burner
from getting across any message.
   But Kunstler said the law's intent is obvious _ to limit free
speech by those who oppose U.S. policies.
   Quoting Thomas Jefferson, Kunstler added: ``It's as if Congress
ordered us to fall down and worship a golden image.''
   Monday's oral arguments marked the first time in nine years the
justices held such a session after April.
   They are reviewing rulings by federal judges in the District of
Columbia and Seattle who said the law violates First Amendment
rights. The law was challenged by demonstrators who burned American
flags in the two cities.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germans cut off from the world by four
decades of Stalinist rule now find the world rushing to them, and
the deluge is severely straining the nation, officials said Monday.
   East Berlin and East German officials held a news conference to
outline what they said has been a flood of impoverished foreigners
lured to East Germany because of its imminent economic unification
with West Germany.
   East Europeans are flooding East Germany at a rate of 500 a day,
and tens of thousands have arrived in recent weeks to seek work in
a land of rising joblessness, the officials said.
   ``If quick regulations for the integration of foreigners are not
created, the problem will become a social powderkeg,'' said Joachim
Krabs, an East Berlin social services official.
   About 18,000 East Europeans, most of them Romanians and
Bulgarians, have entered the country since late April. About 20,000
Poles also have applied for citizenship in recent weeks, and
several thousand Italians have entered the country.
   About 650 East Europeans arrived on Monday morning alone at the
train station in the East Berlin district of Lichetenberg.
   ``We no longer know how we can control this enormous influx,''
said Gerhard Kielmann, a Foreign Ministry official. ``Most of them
are fleeing their poor economic situation in their homeland.''
   Lichetenberg has become a way station for East Europeans
entering the country on tourist visas. Hundreds wander the area
with their belongings. Children beg for money and scores of
families often sleep in the station.
   Krabs said about 600 Romanians and other East Europeans live in
the train station.
   ``The hygiene situation has taken on catastrophic proportions,''
he said. He said many are carrying infectious diseases.
   About 1,100 other East Europeans, most of them Romanians and
some Bulgarians, have been housed for the last week at an army
barracks on a base on the outskirts of Berlin. Another 300 are
housed in another building.
   An estimated 15,000 have crossed the border and were believed
heading for East Berlin, the officials said.
   They said about 80 percent of the newcomers from Eastern Europe
are gypsies. The number of refugees is now averaging about 500 a
day.
   East Germany's sudden attraction is, in a way, a result of the
mass flight of 500,000 East Germans to West Germany in the past
year.
   Many were fleeing the former socialist government that was
toppled in October, but the exodus continued after the country's
borders were opened in November.
   The flight of East Germans contributed to East Germany's
economic problems and the push to unify the nation with West
Germany.
   The West German currency is to be circulated in East Germany on
July 2 as part of a merger of the nations' economies and social
systems.
   East Germany, however, is expected to face widespread
unemployment as scores of factories are closed down when they are
forced to compete in a free market.
   Unemployment already has begun rising as East German consumers
get more access to better Western goods.
   The tensions over joblessness have led to clashes between
foreigners and East Germans in factories and on the streets in
recent weeks.
   A melee broke out in Lichtenberg a week ago when gangs of
foreigners and young East Germans squared off outside a discotheque.
   East Germany is home to tens of thousands of Vietnamese, Cubans
and Mozambicans brought in by the former Communist government to
fill menial jobs.
   East Germany has no system for dealing with asylum seekers. A
government working group has been trying to arrange lodging and
other aid for foreigners.
   Mario Sander, the federal government's deputy commissioner for
foreigner questions, said that within days a ``charitable
structure'' must be created for dealing with the foreigners'
housing and food needs.

<HEAD>EPA Campaign Offers `Tips' to Destroy the Earth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget oil spills, factory pollution and toxic
waste. You, too, can destroy the Earth.
   And the federal government will even tell you how.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has launched a
reverse-psychology campaign dubbed, ``How to Destroy the Earth,''
through public service announcements provided to radio and
television stations, magazines and newspapers.
   The advertisements explain how to waste electricity, overuse
paper products and release toxic chemicals into the air and water.
   The EPA hopes the offbeat campaign will encourage consumers to
adopt household and work habits that will aid environmental
cleanup, said Julie Belaga, regional EPA administrator, at a news
conference Monday.
   The TV spots, for example, feature a smirking announcer. ``Want
to destroy the Earth with your car? No problem. Drive everywhere!''
   ``Hey, want to kill a few trees?'' he inquires, tossing up
sheets of photocopy paper or pulling down a stream of paper towels.
``Lights? Leave them on! Especially when you're not there!''
   The print ads are mini-lessons in destruction. Under bold
letters declaiming, ``How To Destroy the Earth,'' they suggest,
``Use phosphate detergents'' or ``Pour used motor oil into the
ground.''
   The campaign is starting in New England, and EPA officials plan
to take it nationwide.
   The campaign includes billboards, bumper stickers, buttons and a
booklet, slightly larger than a matchbook, with 38 tips on
destroying the Earth. All the ads come with a disclaimer _ ``The
Earth. If you want to save it, find out what you're doing to
destroy it'' and a toll-free information number.
   The ads were designed to ``answer questions the public asks us
over and over and over again: `What can I do to help,''' Belaga
said.
   What the EPA wanted to avoid was the too-earnest approach of
public service announcements, especially with a public saturated by
recent Earth Day publicity, according to agency officials.
   The new campaign ``is, shall we say, subtly aggressive,'' Belaga
said. ``This certainly isn't the bureaucratic, traditional
approach.''
   The ads may grab attention, but will they actually encourage
people to turn off lights, avoid plastic foam products, use
clotheslines instead of dryers and recycle paper at the office?
   Stavros Cosmopulos thinks so. He's the chairman and creative
director of the Boston-based advertising agency that created the
ads.
   ``These suggestions _ or suggestions in reverse, if you will _
are doable things,'' he said. ``I'm doing it. We don't use
Styrofoam cups any more.''
   His firm, Cosmopulos, Crowley and Daly, and several other
private companies donated their services for the campaign.
   Paul G. Keough, EPA deputy regional administrator, said the
yearlong campaign uses an individual rather than a ``global''
approach to environmental problems. He said businesses may feel an
impact, however, if consumers start pressuring companies through
their buying habits.

   Cocaine-related medical emergencies in the
United States showed a 20 percent drop in the fourth quarter of
1989, Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan
reported Monday.
   ``We are making significant headway in our efforts to establish
a drug-free America,'' Sullivan told state and local officials at a
conference called by the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   Sullivan's announcement came in the wake of a congressional
report that said the number of hard-core cocaine addicts in the
country was more than twice what had been estimated earlier.
   The report released last Thursday by the Senate Judiciary
Committee set the figure at 2.2 million, compared with an estimate
of 862,000 made earlier by the National Institute of Drug Abuse.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., committee chairman, said the report
was ``as alarming as it is tragic'' and showed that the
administration's strategy for dealing with the drug crisis was
faulty.
   William J. Bennett, the national drug control policy director,
asked about Biden's remarks at Monday's conference, said, ``If the
strategy is flawed, he needs to tell us how. He needs to make his
case.''
   The Republican governor of Delaware, Michael N. Castle, said the
Judiciary Committee report shows that neither the supply of cocaine
nor the demand for it have been diminished sufficiently.
   ``Just last week we heard that one person out of every 100 in
this country is a hard-core cocaine user _ one of every 40 in New
York City!'' Castle said. ``If we couple this with a 1989 survey of
high school seniors in which many of them said that crack and
cocaine were more available now than in the past, we know that we
have neither stemmed the flow nor sufficiently stifled demand.''
   Sullivan told his audience, ``The fourth quarter data from the
Drug Abuse Warning Network, or DAWN, which reports drug-related
emergency visits, shows a significant decrease _ indeed a drop of
nearly 20 percent _ in the number of cocaine-related cases.''
   He said the data was particularly welcome after ``several years
of increases in reported incidents, followed by the steady levels
of incidents found in last year's quarterly reports.''
   The secretary said the decrease ``was noted in virtually all
metropolitan areas of the DAWN system'' and was also reflected in
preliminary fourth quarter figures from reports of cocaine-related
deaths by medical examiners.
   The reports, Sullivan said, ``are not smoke-and-mirrors
projections, assumptions, extrapolations, or hunches, like some
you've heard recently.''
   ``Today's results are hard-and-fast data, reflecting actual,
reported incidents of cocaine-related medical emergencies. As such,
they confirm what several surveys have indicated over the past
year: that we are making significant headway in our efforts to
establish a drug-free America.''
   Bennett, speaking earlier, said, ``We may now be seeing a
levelling off of addiction. My sense is that we are now beginning
to see a peaking of the addiction problem.''
   The drug control director also told the state and local
officials that stemming drug usage would not come automatically,
but ``if it happens, it will be by the pressure that we bring to
bear.''

   The Supreme Court refused Monday to let an
anti-abortion group protest at abortion clinics in Atlanta, voting
5-4 to leave intact a Georgia judge's injunction.
   The vote focused on free-speech rights more than abortion and
crossed ideological lines.
   The court rejected an emergency request by five members of
Operation Rescue who said the injunction is violating their
free-speech rights.
   In Atlanta, Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Jewitt called
Monday's action ``a little stumble along the way,'' adding, ``We
feel we'll be victorious in the long run.''
   Lynne Randall, who operates a clinic that has been a frequent
target of the protests, welcomed the action. ``We have to balance
women's right to privacy with people's right to protest,'' she said.
   The controversy is still alive in the Georgia courts, but
Monday's action means Operation Rescue protesters for now cannot go
within 50 feet of the property line of any Atlanta facility where
abortions are performed.
   In other matters, the court:
   _Heard a spirited debate over flag burning, an issue with big
political stakes and clashing views over patriotism and freedom of
expression.
   The court must decide by July whether a federal law protecting
``Old Glory'' from desecration is constitutional.
   _Killed a lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield Co. by independent
gasoline dealers in California and Washington state. The court, by
a 7-2 vote, said price-cutting schemes that hurt a competitor's
business do not necessarily violate federal antitrust laws.
   _Voted 6-3 to squelch a lawsuit that charged the United
Steelworkers union with negligence in a 1972 Idaho silver mine
disaster that killed 91 miners. The court said such state court
action is pre-empted by federal labor law.
   _Refused to referee an attack by 30 states against 26
manufacturers over the removal of asbestos from public schools and
other government buildings.
   The court's vote in the Operation Rescue case from Atlanta
yielded strange judicial bedfellows.
   Voting to lift the March 29 injunction were the court's two most
consistent liberals, Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall, and two of its most conservative members, Justices
Anthony M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.
   Brennan and Marshall are strong supporters of abortion rights,
but also are strong supporters of free-speech rights. Kennedy and
Scalia oppose broad abortion rights but have more moderate track
records on free-speech issues.
   Writing for the four, Kennedy cited the court's 1977 decision
that refused to block Nazis from marching in the heavily Jewish
community of Skokie, Ill.
   Kennedy said the 1977 ruling ``does not distinguish among
speakers based on the content of their speech.''
   But Justice John Paul Stevens, who cast a decisive vote to leave
intact the Atlanta injunction, said the court was not drawing any
content-of-speech distinctions.
   Stevens noted that in 1977 the American Nazi Party ``did not
have a similar history of illegal conduct in the jurisdiction where
the march was scheduled,'' and he called Operation Rescue members
``a class of persons who have persistently and repeatedly engaged
in unlawful conduct.''
   Also voting to leave the injunction intact were Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun
and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   Stevens and Blackmun are strong supporters of abortion rights.
Rehnquist, White and O'Connor are not.
   Since July 1988, when Atlanta hosted the National Democratic
Convention, city police have arrested 1,320 demonstrators at
Operation Rescue sit-ins. Many of the protesters barricaded
abortion clinics, blocking patients and employees from entering or
leaving.
   Operation Rescue members Michael Hirsch, Gina Robertson, William
Haynes, Steve Britt and Pamela Sekulow said the Atlanta injunction
deters them ``from engaging in prayer, picketing, leafleting and
other forms of peaceful expression on public forum streets and
sidewalks.''
   The state judge who issued the injunction is considering a
request to modify it, and a formal challenge to the injunction is
before the Georgia Supreme Court.
   Similar legal challenges to Operation Rescue demonstrations at
abortion clinics in other states have left the organization in deep
debt.
   Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who spent time in jail
until a contempt-of-court fine for violating a similar injunction
in New York was paid, called Monday's action ``an outrage.''
   ``Our rights are being denied because we're pro-life Christians.
If we were homosexuals, does anyone really think that we would be
denied access to a public sidewalk,'' he said.

<HEAD>Republicans Eye Spending Cuts; Nobody Wants to Bring Up Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Republicans said Monday they
hope to use budget negotiations to force domestic spending cuts,
while all sides insisted they would not be the first to broach a
possible tax hike.
   At the White House, where the talks open Tuesday, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush would not make specific
proposals to lawmakers. Instead, he said, the president would lay
down his goals for the talks.
   The budget summit is designed to find $50 billion or more in
deficit savings _ either through spending cuts, tax increases or a
combination of the two.
   Democrats expressed lingering distrust toward the
administration's motives in convening the sessions. They cited
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu's comments last week that
higher taxes would not be considered by the president, despite
White House assurances that everything _ including tax increases _
is negotiable.
   ``There is a lot of unease among Democrats,'' said Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Republicans countered that partisan remarks such as Sununu's
were inevitable.
   ``I don't see how you can start one of these summits without
political rhetoric or polarization,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of
New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and
one of the negotiators.
   The talks are aimed at finding enough savings to hold next
year's federal deficit to no more than $64 billion, the target set
by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law. Fiscal 1991 begins Oct. 1.
   White House budget chief Richard Darman has said that $60
billion to $100 billion in deficit reduction might be necessary.
   But he and GOP lawmakers have said that a $50 billion package
might be a more realistic goal for the negotiators. Whatever budget
cuts emerge will have to be enacted in the heat of an election year
in which the entire House and one-third of the Senate is up for
grabs.
   Bush did not plan to begin the bargaining by laying down a
specific budget proposal, said Fitzwater.
   He said Bush has ``points he wants to make'' at the opening
meeting. ``He'll have general goals about getting the deficit
down.''
   An administration official, speaking on the condition he not be
identified, said that it could take a week and a half for opening
statements to be completed and real work to begin. Besides Bush,
four top administration officials and 21 congressional leaders are
scheduled to attend the sessions.
   Participants have said the bargaining could take weeks or months.
   Republicans said Monday that they are especially eager to
control the growth of benefits such as Medicare, farm price
supports and federal employee retirement programs.
   Such programs together account for about half of all government
spending. By law, these programs expand automatically each year as
inflation cuts purchasing power and the number of recipients grows.
   As a result, GOP lawmakers want the talks to produce changes
that will rein in the growth of these benefits in the future. They
also want budget changes that will ensure that the cuts are saved,
rather than simply transferred to other forms of spending.
   ``You have to be able to say the money isn't spent, but it has
to go as designed to deficit reduction,'' said Domenici. ``There is
no way we can do that under current processes.''
   Bush proposed limiting the growth of these programs by $13.9
billion, an amount supported by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas and
another negotiator.
   ``We ought to begin with the president's number,'' said Gramm.
``Let Congress decide exactly how to save the money.''
   Democrats said the reason for the $150 billion annual deficits
of recent years was insufficient revenues and excessive defense
spending, not deficiencies in the budget process.
   ``That's akin to oiling the crank shaft on the Titanic 1{ hours
after it hit the iceberg,'' the Senate Budget Committee chairman,
Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., said of the GOP call for tightened
budget procedures.
   Mitchell said that after a weekend in Maine meeting constituents
and talking by telephone with fellow Democrats, he found that many
in his party believe Bush was never serious about his ``no new
taxes'' campaign promise.
   ``A great many Democrats expressed the view to me that the
president's campaign pledge was phony, that everybody knew it, and
now will have to be broken,'' he said.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued two
presidential decrees Monday declaring Estonian and Latvian
independence moves invalid. The text of those decrees, as
transmitted by the Soviet news agency Tass and translated from
Russian by The Associated Press, follows:
   Presidential Decree on Estonia
   On Declaring Invalid the Resolution of the Estonian Supreme
Soviet, ``On the State Status of Estonia''
   On March 30, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet
Socialist Republic unilaterally, without consulting with the people
of the republic, ignoring the existing economic, political,
cultural and legal ties in the Soviet Union, passed a resolution,
``On the State Status of Estonia.'' By so doing, it violated
Articles 2, 70, 71, 73 and 75 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.,
and the U.S.S.R. law, ``On the procedure of resolving questions
connected with the exit of a republic from the U.S.S.R.''
   On the basis of points 1 and 2 of Article 127, and of Articles
74 and 173 of the U.S.S.R. Constitution, I resolve:
   1. To declare the resolution of the Estonian Supreme Soviet of
March 30, 1990 ``On the State Status of Estonia'' invalid from the
moment it was passed.
   2. To consider as illegal any acts of governmental agencies and
officials, and also citizens, performed on the basis of this
resolution.

   Presidential Decree on Latvia
   On the Declaration of the Latvian Supreme Soviet, ``On the
Restoration of the Independence of the Latvian Republic''
   On May 4, 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Soviet
Socialist Republic passed the declaration ``On the Restoration of
Independence of the Latvian Republic.'' In it is announced that the
declaration of the Latvian parliament of July 21, 1940, on the
entry of Latvia into the U.S.S.R. does not have legal force. At the
same time it talks about the renewal of the validity of a series of
articles from the Latvian Republic's Constitution of 1922.
   The declaration in question was passed by the Latvian Supreme
Soviet in a violation of Articles 70, 71, 73 and 75 of the
Constitution of the USSR, and also the U.S.S.R. law of April 3,
1990, ``On the procedure of resolving questions connected with the
exit of a republic from the U.S.S.R.'' It goes against the rights
and interests of other subjects of the Soviet federation, of the
U.S.S.R. With its passage, the Constitution of the Latvian Soviet
Socialist Republic, which provides for the holding of a referendum
on the exit of a republic from the Soviet Union, was also violated.
   On the basis of points 1 and 2 of Article 127, Article 74 and
173 of the Constitution of the U.S.S.R., I resolve:
   To declare the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian
Soviet Socialist Republic of May 4, 1990, ``On the Restoration of
the Independence of the Latvian Republic'' void of legal force from
the moment of its passage.

<HEAD>Study Boosts Argument for AZT Treatment of Symptom-Free AIDS
Infections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study shows that some AIDS-infected
people without symptoms may be helped by the drug AZT even if
certain key immune cells appear normal.
   The findings by scientists at the University of California, Los
Angeles, will be published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
   People who are infected by the AIDS virus but have no outward
symptoms often display reduced levels of certain immune system
white blood cells known as T-cells.
   Doctors generally determine how badly the AIDS virus has hurt
the body's disease-fighting immune system by measuring T-cells.
That's because T-cells activate many parts of the body's defense
system, including other white blood cells called monocytes and
macrophages.
   Macrophages are grown-up versions of monocytes. Both types of
cells are found in various body tissues, where they act as
scavengers that gobble up debris and invading microbes to help
combat disease.
   A low T-cell count often is the justification used by doctors in
deciding whether the antiviral drug AZT should be prescribed for
AIDS-infected people who haven't yet developed overt symptoms.
   The new study found that, in the test tube, the virus can
directly cause defects in monocytes and macrophages regardless of
whether T-cells are damaged or not, said Dr. David Golde, chief of
blood diseases and cancer at UCLA.
   The researchers also showed that AZT significantly reduced the
AIDS-induced damage to macrophages and monocytes.
   Both findings suggest AIDS-infected people might benefit from
AZT therapy even if their T-cell levels are not abnormally low,
Golde said.
   But he emphasized that he wasn't advocating AZT treatment for
all AIDS-infected people with normal T-cell levels, only those who
are tested and found to have damaged macrophages.
   The study was conducted in Golde's laboratory by research
biologist Gayle Cocita Baldwin, Golde and others.
   AZT has been used for three years to treat patients severely ill
with AIDS symptoms.
   In March, the Food and Drug Administration recommended that
adults infected with the deadly virus be treated with AZT even if
they do not yet have symptoms of the disease. The recommendation
stemmed from federally sponsored studies showing that AZT slowed
the progression of AIDS in infected patients with early symptoms or
without any symptoms.
   But the recommendation also was based on the work of a
scientific advisory panel that said AZT should be used only on
symptom-free patients with reduced T-cell counts.
   The new study suggests the drug might help even AIDS-infected
people with normal T-cell counts.
   Researchers have known for some time that monocytes and
macrophages are defective in people infected by the AIDS virus.
   But they didn't know if the virus directly attacked macrophages
and monocytes to make them defective, or if they were defective
simply as a secondary result of the viral attack on T-cells, Golde
said.
   To perform the study, Baldwin and her colleagues took monocytes
from human blood, infected them with the AIDS virus, then let them
grow into macrophages. They found the infected macrophages were
defective in their disease-fighting ability.
   ``What we found is that in pure cultures of monocytes and
macrophages, the AIDS virus itself causes the function of these
cells to be defective,'' Golde said.
   Certain strains of the AIDS virus are more likely to damage
monocytes and macrophages, while other strains seem to attack
mainly the T-cells, Golde said.
   ``It may be that certain patients are infected with strains that
would have their major impact on macrophages and monocytes, and in
those patients antiviral therapy would appear to be useful'' even
if T-cell counts weren't dramatically reduced, he added.

   The Dow Jones industrial average on Monday
soared to a record high closing.
   The widely followed average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks
finished up 19.95 at 2,821.53, topping the record close of 2,810.15
set on Jan. 2.
   Broader market indicators also advanced strongly, and about two
issues rose in price for every one that declined on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The recent rally _ which has seen the Dow industrials rise more
than 176 points since April 27 _ has been attributed to a sudden
favorable swing in economic indicators. The swing has reduced
worries that inflation and interest rates were heading higher.
   Interest rates kept falling Monday after dropping sharply on
Friday. Yields on long-term government bonds, which topped 9
percent a few weeks ago, had dropped to the 8.58 percent-8.60
percent range by late Monday.
   Falling rates are seen not only as stimulating business
activity, which would be good for corporate profits, but also as
reducing the returns on interest-bearing investments such as bonds,
which prompts some investors to switch funds to the stock market.
   Brokers say the drop in rates touched off a rush to buy stocks
among money managers at investing institutions who had been sitting
on large cash reserves.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, already facing a total of
eight cocaine possession and perjury charges, will be arraigned
Tuesday on six more drug-related charges, court officials said
Monday.
   A federal grand jury indicted Barry, 54, Thursday on five
misdemeanor cocaine possession charges and a misdemeanor charge of
conspiracy to possess cocaine.
   The new, broader indictment, which includes the earlier charges,
alleged that Barry ``possessed cocaine and crack with other
co-conspirators at more than twenty locations, including private
residences, hotels, government offices and business establishments
and on boats.''
   The indictment accused Barry of conspiring to possess cocaine
and possessing the drug between the fall of 1984 and his arrest in
January in a FBI sting operation at a downtown hotel.
   Since his arrest, Barry has spent seven weeks in South Carolina
and Florida rehabilitation programs for treatment of what he said
was abuse of alcohol and prescription drugs.
   The earlier indictment included five misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges and three felony perjury charges.
   Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, on Friday said the new
charges were ``unduly burdensome'' on the eve of the scheduled June
4 trial and ``unfair to the defense.''
   Barry has not announced whether he will seek a fourth, four-year
term in this year's election. However, he has increased his
campaign-style appearances in recent weeks.

   A bomb hidden in a flowerbed outside an army
office exploded before dawn Monday and injured seven people,
officials said. The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility.
   Scotland Yard said the time bomb containing plastic explosives
was buried outside the front entrance of the Directorate of Army
Education in Eltham, southeast London.
   Commander George Churchill Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, said the bomb could have had a timer set ``a
couple of hours or many days'' before the explosion.
   ``It's important to warn everyone, particularly military
personnel and those involved in Irish affairs, about this fairly
new development,'' he said. ``This device was buried and was not
visible to the naked eye.''
   Four men and three women were treated for minor injuries, said a
spokesman for Brook Hospital in Greenwich. One of the men, Trevor
Hills, was blown across a room in the blast and suffered two broken
ribs. Hills is responsible for resettling soldiers into civilian
life.
   All of the injured were civilian employees of the directorate.
   The directorate commander, Lt. Col. John Simmonds, said the
explosion overturned a car in the parking lot and shattered several
windshields.
   ``There's no doubt about it, we were lucky,'' Simmonds said.
``Fortunately nobody was in the car park, everyone was in the
building.''
   ``There was a very loud explosion,'' said Lucy Hawker, a nearby
resident. ``My first thought was that a bomb had gone off _ and it
could only be at the army institute.''
   The building is the headquarters for the Royal Army Education
Corps. Authorities said the approximately 50 army and civilian
employees at the center were evacuated and were all accounted for.
   Defense Minister Archie Hamilton said increased security
measures, such as plastic film laminated to windows, prevented more
serious injuries. The film prevents the glass from shattering.
   ``It is extremely difficult to ever get 100 percent security in
any establishment,'' Hamilton said. ``We're talking about a
predominance of civilians here, and there are no markers to
indicate that it is a Ministry of Defense establishment.''
   In a statement signed by the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau,
in Dublin, the Irish Republican Army said: ``An active service unit
planted a device containing over 10 pounds of plastic explosives
after penetrating security procedures.
   ``This institute is a facility for the training of British army
officers to a high level in maintaining military and colonial
domination in our country,'' the statement said.
   In its campaign to create a unified socialist state in Ireland,
the IRA has claimed responsibility for attacking other army
installations in Britain and Europe.
   In the worst of the attacks, an IRA bomb killed 11 bandsmen at
the Royal Marine School of Music in Deal, Kent last September.

<TEXT>
   Retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who is
under a death sentence, appealed a war crimes conviction to
Israel's Supreme Court on Monday and his attorney's key argument
was that the trial judges were biased.
   A three-judge panel ruled in April 1988 that Ukrainian-born
Demjanjuk, 70, was ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a cruel guard who
operated gas chambers at the Nazis' Treblinka death camp in Poland
in 1942-43. More than 850,000 Jews perished there.
   Demjanjuk was sentenced to die under a 1950 Israeli law allowing
prosecution of Nazis and collaborators.
   He was extradited from his home in Cleveland in February 1986
after an Ohio court stripped him of his citizenship for lying about
a Nazi past on immigration forms. Demjanjuk says he is a victim of
mistaken identity and was held in German POW camps during the time
in question.
   Demjanjuk's Israeli attorney, Yoram Sheftel, told the
five-justice Supreme Court panel he challenged the conviction on 10
separate points. The most significant is ``the bias of the court,''
he said.
   Sheftel said, ``It should lead to the clear conclusion that the
conviction should be canceled and especially in a case where the
sentence is capital punishment.''
   Demjanjuk, clad in a dark brown prison uniform, listened
impassively from a witness stand throughout the proceedings,
guarded by two policemen. He muttered ``good morning'' in Hebrew as
he came into the courtroom, handcuffed, and then embraced his son,
John Demjanjuk Jr.
   The defendant's wife Vera also attended. She refused to speak to
reporters.
   Sheftel also accused the Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations of failing to provide all evidence in Demjanjuk's
case to the defense, and said conducting the defense ``was like a
boxing match with one contestant standing with his hands tied
behind his back.''
   The office hunts suspected Nazis in the United States.
   ``The OSI claimed we got all the documents,'' although many
weren't forwarded, Sheftel complained.
   The lawyer said a hostile atmosphere was created by news reports
and the judges' treatment of the defense during the 17-month trial.
   He claimed trial judges Dov Levine, Dalia Dorner and Shmuel Tal
subscribed to a clipping service that delivered twice daily reports
from newspapers which carried biased reports. He said the judges
briefed reporters on occasion.
   He said frequent shouts and interruptions came from the audience
at the trial, which was held in a converted movie theater.
   ``Not only was an appearance of justice lacking but justice in
fact was not done,'' said Sheftel.
   He said the judges interrupted defense cross-examinations and
intervened in the proceedings.
   He also argued that the judges dismissed conflicting testimony
from one of five Treblinka survivors whose testimony was crucial to
Demjanjuk's conviction.
   He said the survivor missed picking out Demjanjuk in a 1980
photo lineup _ ``This is 20 percent of the evidence, one of five
key witnesses it raises a significant question.''
   Sheftel claimed the prosecutors inflamed emotions unnecessarily
by dwelling on the history of the Holocaust, in which 6 million
Jews died.
   Prosecutor Yonah Blattman interrupted Sheftel once in the first
five hours of arguments, saying Sheftel's grounds for claiming bias
``are not legal or factual arguments and are not worthy of being
brought before the court.''
   Chief Justice Meir Shamgar overruled the objection.
   The defense lawyer also challenged Israel's jurisdiction to try
Demjanjuk as a war criminal.
   He said Israel's extradition treaty with the United States and
the warrant under which Demjanjuk was deported allowed for trying a
suspect on murder charges but not genocide or mass murder.
   Sheftel outlined other points challenging the verdict that he
said he would detail in the coming five weeks of court sessions.
   A major point is the defense claim that a key piece of
prosecution evidence, the so-called Trawniki Card, is a forgery.
The card, supplied by the Soviet Union, says Demjanjuk was trained
at an elite Nazi SS camp to be a concentration camp guard.

<HEAD>Domestic Call Deadly for Two Chicago Policemen</HEAD>

   It was a call for a domestic disturbance, one of
more than one million that the Chicago police respond to every
year. For 20-year veterans Gregory A. Hauser and Raymond C. Kilroy,
it was to be their last call.
   The partners and friends were shot to death outside a house
where they answered a report of a disturbance between a grandmother
and her grandson _ on Mother's Day night.
   It happened just two days before National Police Memorial Day,
held annually on May 15 to honor officers killed in the line of
duty.
   Domestic violence is ``probably the most common call the police
get and probably results in the greatest number of injuries to
police because one number correlates to the other,'' said John
Dineen, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Chicago Lodge.
   Dineen canceled his trip to Washington, D.C., to join
observations of the national holiday. ``For our officers,'' he
said, ``to make sure they get the proper burial, the memorial they
deserve here.''
   Police did not know Monday afternoon when the funerals would be.
   When off work, Hauser and Kilroy were business partners who ran
a locksmith business out of a truck on their days off to supplement
their police salaries, said fellow officer Harold Brown.
   Hauser was 43, married, and the father of two boys and a girl,
ages 7 to 15. Kilroy, 46, was single. Both patrolmen had spent
Mother's Day with their families before reporting for duty, said
Chicago Police department spokeswoman Tina Vicini.
   ``Both of them are hard-working guys,'' said Brown. ``They were
both nice guys. Just super nice guys.''
   On Sunday night, the officers went to the working-class
Northwest neighborhood and later called for backups, police said.
Hauser and Kilroy were found with gunshot wounds to the head and
body.
   More than 100 officers working with dogs poured into the
neighborhood. After a several-hour manhunt, the suspect was
cornered under a porch.
   Roman Chavez, 23, was charged Monday with two counts of
first-degree murder and one count of armed robbery, the latter
because authorities said he took one of the officers' guns.
   Anthony Calabrese, supervisor of the homicide division of the
state's attorney's office, said, it was too early to say whether
that gun was used to kill the officers. He also declined to discuss
a motive for the slaying.
   Calabrese said Chavez was arrested eight times as a juvenile and
four times as an adult _ the most recent arrest in suburban
Elmhurst in February for battery and eluding of a police officer.
   Chavez had lived with his grandmother for six or seven years
ago, after his parents divorced, said Nickie Carsello, who lives
next door.
   ``He was fine when he first moved in,'' she said. ``He used to
help out. He put our air conditioner in the window. He would cut
our lawn. He was a real nice kid.''
   But four years ago, Chavez's step-grandfather was killed by a
train he didn't see as he stepped across railroad tracks near the
home. After that, there was a transformation in ``Sammy,'' as
Chavez was known to the Carsellos.
   Ms. Carsello said the home shared by Chavez and his grandmother,
probably in her 70s, was a blight on the neighborhood, consisting
otherwise of neatly kept single-family homes.
   She recalled asking the grandmother, ``Why don't you have him
cut your lawn?' ... She said I'm afraid to talk to him, he might
hurt me.''
   Chavez was being held without bail in Cook County Jail and has
been assigned a public defender. A preliminary hearing was
scheduled for June 1.
   ``Now we'll go through the process of the wakes and the
funerals,'' said Dineen.
   ``Then comes the trial _ the offender _ that's when you begin to
wonder if there's any justice in the world. After the trial comes
the appeals where the offender does his best to stay out of jail.
And you have two police officers who are dead. They have no trial,
no appeal, just execution.''

   Neither time nor distance wipe out
child support obligations, the Florida Supreme Court told a
Virginia woman who was abandoned nearly 22 years ago while pregnant
with her third child.
   The result of the woman's long, draining legal battle is
expected to affect family courts in other states, some attorneys
said Monday.
   ``The biggest thing I feel is a sense of satisfaction,''
Patricia Bennett, 44, of Springfield, Va., said. ``It was a
tremendous amount of work, (but) this will affect thousands.''
   Bennett, a non-lawyer who represented herself in oral arguments
before Florida's high court more than two years ago, said she
thinks last week's decision could be followed by courts in other
states. She listed California, Texas, Ohio, and West Virginia as
states that remain havens for delinquent parents.
   In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that Florida judges can
jail for contempt parents who have not paid out-of-state child
support awards and that back child support awards must be paid,
even after children become adults.
   Attorneys who filed friends of the court briefs supporting
Bennett's case agreed with her Monday that the ruling was
significant both legally and symbolically.
   ``Legally, of course, this decision is only binding in the state
of Florida,'' said Sally Goldfarb of New York, a staff attorney for
the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``But frequently in
family law matters, courts look to the decisions of other states in
order to get insights.''
   ``Because so many out-of-state cases are mentioned we suspect it
will have national prominence,'' said Joe Boyd of Tallahassee, who
represents the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services.
   But also important is the message the ruling sends to delinquent
parents, the two attorneys said.
   ``The court forcefully and eloquently stated that child support
obligations become stronger with time and that no parent should be
permitted to turn his back on the children whom he abandoned,''
Goldfarb said.
   ``I guess `Read my lips' is what the Florida Supreme Court has
said,'' Boyd said.
   Bennett and her ex-husband, Oscar Gibson, were married in 1964;
five years later he disappeared. In 1985, Bennett found him living
with a different name and a different wife in rural Lutz, Fla., and
her legal struggle to get back child support from him resumed.
   Bennett's daughters now are 21, 22 and 23. The eldest has a
16-month-old son. A CBS movie called ``Runaway Father,'' based on
her story, is being made.
   Once children reach 18, parents who raised them are ``not
magically reimbursed for personal funds spent nor debts incurred
due to nonpayment of child support,'' Justice Gerald Kogan wrote in
Thursday's majority opinion.
   ``Hardships suffered by a family do not disappear,'' Kogan said.
``A family's feelings of indignation from abandonment by the
nonpaying parent or from past reliance on public assistance are not
forgotten.''
   Bennett received welfare for two years after Gibson left her.
But since then, however, she has earned a bachelor's degree and a
master's degree in business adminstration. She works now as a
financial analyst for the Internal Revenue Service and has applied
to law school.
   Bennett's ex-husband, now known as James Parker, has been making
$100 payments every week since 1987. But the insurance claims
adjuster said he'd have to make payments to wipe out $148,536 in
back payments, interest and expenses a Virginia court said he owes.
   ``Probably until I'm dead,'' Parker said.
   Mark Kelly, who represented Parker, said he thought the ruling
``really gives the party (trying to collect) twice as much leverage
as they had before.''

   A lawyer for a Cuban exile said Monday he'll
seek to question two former leaders of Chile's secret police who
allegedly ordered the assassination of ex-Chilean ambassador
Orlando Letelier.
   Attorney Paul Goldberger's client, Dionisio Suarez Esquivel, was
ordered Monday by U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson to
stand trial beginning Sept. 10 on charges that he helped carry out
the Letelier killing.
   Suarez was arrested April 11 in St. Petersburg, Fla., after 12
years as a fugitive. He is charged with conspiracy, murdering a
foreign official, two counts of murder and using explosives that
result in death.
   Letelier and an aide, Ronni Moffitt, died when a bomb attached
to the car in which they rode was detonated in Washington on Sept.
21, 1976.
   The Chilean government has refused to extradite the two former
Chilean secret police offials.
   Juan Manuel Contreras Sepulveda and Pedro Espinoza Bravo were
indicted along with Suarez and five other people in 1978. It will
be up to the judge to decide whether to order depositions from
Contreras and Espinoza for the Suarez case.
   A Chilean official did say Saturday that Chile has agreed to pay
compensation to the families of Letelier and Moffitt. But the
announcement by acting Interior Minister Belisario Velasco was not
expected to affect the criminal cases.
   An outspoken critic of the Chilean regime of Augusto Pinochet,
Letelier had been the ambassador to the United States under the
Marxist government of Salvador Allende.
   The government's chief witness against Suarez is expected to be
Michael Townley, a U.S. citizen who worked for the Chilean
intelligence service, DINA.
   In court, Goldberger said U.S. officials had refused to
extradite Townley, who apparently is in the U.S. government's
witness protection program. Townley had been implicated in a murder
case in Argentina involving an exiled Chilean general, Carlos
Pratz. Pratz died in a bomb blast.
   Prosecutors did not comment on Goldberger's assertion that the
U.S. had turned down an Argentine request to turn over Townley, who
admitted planting the bomb in the Letelier killing and served a
40-month prison term.
   Goldberger also represented another defendant in the Letelier
case, Guillermo Novo Sampol. Sampol, now living in the Miami area,
was convicted of perjury. Appearing in court, Novo said he had no
objection to Goldberger representing Suarez. Prosecutors have said
they might call Novo as a witness against Suarez.
   Outside the courtroom, Novo said he is involved in fund raising
for Suarez's legal defense.
   On April 24, the Chilean Suprme Court ordered the reopening of
an investigation in Chile into the Letelier assassination. The
ruling came after a woman named Liliana Walker, a Chilean security
agent, said in newspaper interviews that she had helped in the
preparations for the assassination.
   She said she accompanied another agent, Armando Fernandez
Larios, to Washington in 1976 to helped in the groundwork.
Fernandez left Chile secretly in 1987 and surrendered in the United
States, where he admitted participating in the preparations.
Goldberger said he wants to question Walker as well as the two
former DINA officers.

<TEXT>
   The University of South Carolina's
president has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on gifts for
donors, office artwork and teaching salaries for celebrities such
as Robby Benson and Jihan Sadat.
   Now James B. Holderman's lavish spending, which has given him
trouble for years, has once again raised the ire of state
lawmakers, who have warned him to spend public funds more wisely if
he wants to keep his job.
   ``People are tired of it,'' Rep. Herb Kirsh said Monday. ``I
feel things will be different from here on out. The public is
demanding it. South Carolinians don't like that kind of spending.''
   Legislators earlier this month blasted Holderman after local
newspapers revealed he spent $533,898 in the past year on items
such as $800-a-night hotel rooms for himself, $6,400 on sculptures
for his office and $163,000 for meals and receptions for potential
donors.
   Many of the expenses were charged to Holderman's $500,000
discretionary account _ which is funded with receipts from vending
machines and concessions _ and his state-issued American Express
card. By comparison, Clemson University President Max Lennon has a
discretionary account of $18,000.
   Holderman has defended his spending as a vital part of
fund-raising for the state-supported university of 40,000 students,
saying his efforts have helped raise $25 million for USC in the
last year. But he promised to keep his expenses down following
public criticism.
   He said the fallout from the latest revelations has ``taught me
the difficulty of taking a macro view of things.''
   ``Some people tend to take a micro view of things, and that's
where there seems to be a misunderstanding,'' he said last week.
   But if Holderman wants to remain at the helm of the state's
flagship university, state lawmakers and his own board of trustees
have insisted that he curb his spending.
   Kirsh said Holderman has set a bad example for students. If he
does not follow spending guidelines being set by the newly elected
board of trustees, the legislator said he would favor Holderman's
dismissal.
   ``He's only doing it now because of the public outcry,'' Kirsh
said.
   Board of trustees chairman Michael Mungo has also made it clear
that Holderman must control his spending according to the
guidelines or face dismissal.
   Holderman, who has presided over the university since 1977,
first drew criticism in 1986 when it was revealed he ran up
generous hotel bills during fund-raising trips and bought expensive
gifts for donors.
   He then came under fire for spending huge amounts of money to
recruit celebrities such as Benson, an actor and director who has
taught filmmaking as an artist-in-residence since 1988.
   The school has paid Benson $158,367 in salary and expenses and
$15,600 for rent, while Holderman has kicked in $10,000 from his
discretionary account for moving and travel expenses.
   In addition, the university still holds about $23,000 in unpaid
bills from the production of Benson's latest movie, ``Modern
Love,'' which was filmed in South Carolina. Benson has said the
bills will be paid and the school will receive 2 percent of the
movie's profits.
   Benson's two-year contract expires Tuesday and no new contract
offer has been made, school spokeswoman Debra Allen said Monday.
   Benson did not return calls left at his office Monday seeking
comment, but he has said he would leave if his work was not
appreciated.
   Other prominent personalities hired by Holderman for fat
contracts include Jihan Sadat, widow of the late Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat, who was paid $200,000 to teach a course in Egyptian
culture for three semesters in 1985 and 1986.
   In contrast, ``Deliverance'' author James Dickey was hired in
1969, before Holderman came aboard, and receives an $80,000 annual
salary to teach four writing courses. He pays his secretary's
salary and his expenses out of his own pocket.
   The university under Holderman's leadership also has been
criticized by lawmakers for sloppy bookkeeping and using public
funds, employees and equipment to operate the school's 10 private
fund-raising foundations.

<HEAD>U.S., Iran Sign Small-Claims Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Iran have signed a $105
million lump-sum settlement of small U.S. claims rising out of the
Islamic revolution, the State Department announced Monday.
   Department officials said that the talks leading to the
settlement of more than 2,300 U.S. claims of up to $250,000 each
were not linked to the recent release of two U.S. hostages held by
pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon or to the fate of the six
Americans still held there.
   Negotiations still are underway on about $400,000 worth of small
Iranian claims against the United States, most of them filed by
Iranian soldiers in training in the United States who were ordered
expelled after the 1979 Iranian revolution.
   The settlement of the U.S. claims must now be approved by the
Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, established in the Dutch city
of The Hague under the 1981 Algiers Accords.
   The accords set the terms for the release of the Americans held
hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for 444 days.
   Although the agreement represents a step toward repairing badly
frayed U.S.-Iranian relations, officials noted there are still deep
divisions over larger claims made by Iran as well as over the
hostage question.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, noted that
President Bush has said repeatedly that a good place to start the
normalization of relations ``would be the release of all American
hostages.''
   The settlement signed Sunday does clear the way for the tribunal
to deal with about $16 billion in major contested claims.
   As to the outstanding Iranian small claims, a senior U.S.
official who briefed reporters on the settlement on the condition
he not be identified said the claims include some $10 billion for
military properties.
   He said that while the United States believes there is value to
some of the Iranian claims, for others running into the billions of
dollars, ``our view and the Iranian view of what these totals are
are far apart.''
   Once the tribunal approves the settlement of the U.S. small
claims, the $105 million will be paid to the United States in one
lump sum.
   Final distribution to a large variety of claimants _ including
many Americans who lost their personal possessions when they fled
Tehran after the revolution against the government of Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi _ will be made by the Justice Department's Foreign
Claims Settlement Commission.
   The U.S. official said that there is no way to predict how long
that might take, but past experience indicates it could take two to
four years.
   U.S. officials said that payments will be made far faster than
if the tribunal were to attempt to settle the cases one by one.
   The settlement accord was signed late Sunday night by Timothy
Ramish, U.S. agent to the tribunal, and Ali Nobari, the Iranian
agent, according to an American official at the tribunal. The
negotiations were conducted for the United States by Judge Abraham
Sofaer, the State Department's chief legal adviser.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday declared
independence moves by Latvia and Estonia ``illegal and invalid''
but gave no hint whether he would retaliate with sanctions as he
has with Lithuania.
   In two presidential decrees, read Monday on the nightly TV news
program ``Vremya,'' Gorbachev clearly rejected a weekend appeal by
the three Baltic presidents to recognize their statehood.
   The decrees said Latvia's May 4 declaration of independence and
Estonia's March 30 declaration that it was an occupied country
violated Soviet law and the constitution.
   In Latvia, officials said they awaited an anti-independence
protest outside the Parliament building and a republic-wide
political strike Tuesday. Helicopters dropped leaflets on the
Latvian capital of Riga on Monday calling for the strike and
protest.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
in 1940. Lithuania declared its independence March 11 and began
passing laws toward that end, enraging Moscow and bringing on an
embargo of oil, natural gas and other raw materials.
   Gorbachev's initial response to Lithuania's declaration
paralleled Monday's decrees: he declared it ``illegal and invalid''
and asked Lithuania to rescind it.
   Latvia and Estonia passed more cautious measures, allowing for
an unspecified transition period to independence, but their moves
proved equally unacceptable.
   The presidential decrees, in dry, legal language, listed the
points of the law and constitution violated by the Estonian and
Latvian measures.
   Gorbachev rebuked the two republics, saying Estonia acted
``without having consulted with the people of the republic,
ignoring its existing economic, political, cultural and legal
ties'' with Moscow. He said Latvia had ``gone against the rights
and interests of other subjects of the Soviet federation.''
   Gorbachev called Latvia's decree ``invalid from the moment of
its passage,'' and the same went for Estonia's measure.
   On Saturday, the three Baltic presidents revived a 1934 Council
of Baltic States, pledging cooperation and asking Gorbachev and
President Bush to discuss their independence at the U.S.-Soviet
summit opening May 30.
   In Lithuania, Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene said Monday
her government still wants to compromise with Moscow.
   ``We are ready to compromise on isues that are vital to the
Soviet Union, defense, borders, customs, military presence.'' she
said.
   She declined to go into specifics, but said she would make
definite proposals before Gorbachev meets Bush so he could ``make
serious decisions before going to Washington.''
   In Latvia, the helicopter leaflets urged citizens to ``take to
the streets'' Tuesday and ``demand the restoration of Soviet
power,'' said Aris Jansons, chief aide to Latvia's president.
   The leaflets called for a strike at 10 a.m. Tuesday and told
workers to converge on parliament, where ``a handful of traitors
and political adventurers who are deciding our fate instead of us
should tremble at the voice of the working class.''
   Earlier Monday, more than 100 Soviet army officers tried to
enter the Latvian Supreme Soviet parliament, leading to a scuffle
in which a Latvian radio reporter and several women were slightly
injured, reports said.
   The scuffle, which involved mothers of Latvian soldiers who were
killed, ended when Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov invited in
some officers to air their complaints, Jansons said in a telephone
interview.
   Soviet officers repeatedly have demonstrated against
independence in front of the parliament.
   Latvia's declaration of independence has stirred protests from
among the 46 percent of the population that is non-Latvian and from
many army officers stationed there.
   Latvia has 2.8 million people.
   On Friday, Latvia's police force said it would submit to orders
only from Moscow and ignore commands from the Latvian government,
Jansons said.
   He said this made the government concerned for the security of
the parliament building Tuesday, and many people feared the
lawmakers would be blocked from entering.
   Members of various grassroots organizations plan to try to
defend the Supreme Soviet building and the parliament's
independence move Tuesday, said Anda Anspoka, a spokeswoman for the
Latvian People's Front.
   ``They are going to stand there and do their best, picketing and
expressing their opinions,'' she said.
   The building was guarded previously by police and People's Front
volunteers.
   Jansons said groups dominated by ethnic Russians in all three
republics appeared to be coordinating a regional anti-independence
action for Tuesday, and sources in Vilnius confirmed plans for a
Baltic-wide protest.
   Pavelas Gilis said Russian-dominated Communist parties planned
to stage political meetings throughout Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia on Tuesday. Gilis is a secretary of the Lithuanian
Communist Party that broke with its Moscow parent party in December
and backs independence.
   Since annexation 50 years ago, the non-native population has
swelled to almost 50 percent in Latvia and Estonia, where
anti-independence movements are stronger than in native-dominated
Lithuania.
   A Soviet colonel told a Vilnius news conference Monday the
Lithuanian government was denying medical care to officers and
their families, and hostility was running so high that Soviet
officers changed into civilian clothes before going onto the
streets.
   Col. Konstantin Golubeyev, political commissar for Soviet armed
forces in Lithuania, also said unidentified assailants fired into a
Soviet officer's apartment.

   Sen. Edward Kennedy turned actor Monday,
portraying a Harvard Square train station in an algebra lesson that
helped turn a U.S. Senate hearing into a lively variety show for
300 children.
   The young audience also met 4-foot robot, a Harvard scientist
who showed them a telescope that can be made for less than $1 and a
fifth-grade teacher who borrowed a real dinosaur skull for a
make-believe trip to the Western desert to study paleontology.
   The setting was a hearing to take testimony for a Senate bill
aimed at boosting education in math, science and technology.
   In a departure from the customary decorous exchange of testimony
and questions, the hearing was held in a theater at the Museum of
Science and included middle school youngsters from the Boston area.
Teachers with novel methods and program instructors deploying high
technology showed how they inspire enthusiasm among children in
science and math.
   The need for enthusiasm is dire.
   According to figures gathered by the Labor and Human Resources
Committee about the 24,000 U.S. high schools, 7,000 offer no
physics course; 4,000 offer no chemistry and 2,000 offer not a
single biology course.
   Among the nation's elementary and high school science teachers a
full 60,000 are unqualified to teach that subject.
   Half the faculty jobs in U.S. graduate schools of engineering
are held by foreigners because of a dearth of American engineering
teachers.
   Yet it is projected that by the year 2006, America will be short
675,000 scientists and engineers, and by 2000 industry will be
short 2 million technicians.
   Just 10 years from now the country will need 300,000 more
science teachers.
   Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Utah, are cosponsors of the
Excellence in Math, Science and Engineering Education Act, which is
now before Kennedy's Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   The bill sets out a 10-year schedule of appropriations, starting
with $125 million for improving and monitoring science and math
education. It would direct more attention as well to technological
training in industry and to bringing more women and minorities into
the field.
   The Labor committee is expected to vote on the bill soon and, if
it passes muster, send it to the Senate floor this summer.
   Among the presentations at the hearing was the algebra lesson
invented by Boston teacher Robert Moses. It translates the
abstractions of A plus B equals C into reality.
   Moses enlisted Kennedy along with nine students to stand in
front of the auditorium to represent train stops on the Red Line
subway route connecting Boston and Cambridge.
   Three children played the train, chug-chugging between the
stations. Such lessons, conducted over time and interspersed with
trips on real trains, are used to teach children the concept that a
variable like ``x'' or ``y'' can, in algebra, stand for a real
number. The also help relate math to real life.
   The problem may go even deeper than the need to make math and
science more relevant, however.
   Jane Holdsworth of The Thames Science Center in New London,
Conn., told Kennedy that while wheeling in her robot to make her
presentation, a little girl asked her if the robot bites.
   ``I hope we're getting to the day when we know that robots don't
bite,'' Holdsworth said. ``And that math and science don't bite.
They're fun.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Reassigns 2 Top Aides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh reassigned
two top aides Monday in what appeared to be an attempt to dispel
the perception he is surrounded by a tight circle of loyal aides.
   Robert S. Ross Jr., Thornburgh's chief of staff, will spend the
next two to three months organizing a new office of international
affairs, then return to private legal practice, said senior
department officials.
   David Runkel, Thornburgh's press secretary who has endured
stormy relations with reporters, has been reassigned to be director
of communications, said the officials, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   The changes took effect Monday. Thornburgh was in the process of
selecting a new director of the Office of Public Affairs, who will
serve as the department's chief spokesman, the officials said.
   The changes were disclosed by officials close to Thornburgh just
three days after Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer announced
after just six months in office that he would resign on May 25.
   The same day that Ayer disclosed his plans to leave, the White
House announced its intention to nominate Assistant Attorney
General William Barr to be the new deputy attorney general.
   Ayer decided to leave because he felt he lacked the traditional
authority usually given a deputy attorney general to oversee the
day-to-day operations of the department, according to
administration sources.
   One source said Ayer was kept out of the decision-making process
by Thornburgh's top aides.
   Ross, who functioned as Thornburgh's chief of staff, retained
many of the responsibilities normally given to the deputy attorney
general, one official said.
   Officials said that Barr would be given the authority that Ayer
sought but was never given as part of Thornburgh's effort to turn
management of the department over to the deputy and the assistant
attorneys general.
   Thornburgh has run an extremely tight ship, holding
decision-making power among a small circle of aides who worked for
him when he was governor of Pennsylvania.
   Both Ross and Runkel, members of a trio that includes longtime
aide Murray Dickman, served as top aides to Thornburgh in
Harrisburg.
   Dickman is expected to remain on the attorney general's staff,
which is expected to play a more ``low-key role'' in department
operations, officials said.
   ``It was never his (Thornburgh's) intention to have a small
personal staff attempting to run the department,'' said one
official.
   ``When the dust settles, you are going to see a Washington team
in place,'' said another official.
   Ayer was given the unpleasant and difficult assignments of
defending the Bush administration's opposition to undoing a series
of Supreme Court decisions on civil rights that Democrats in
Congress are anxious to blunt.
   Ayer's resignation was announced two weeks after the disclosure
that he had been ordered to withdraw a letter expressing Justice
Department support for sentencing guidelines for corporations
convicted of crimes.
   Runkel said the letter was unauthorized because Thornburgh had
not seen it before Ayer sent it to the U.S. Sentencing Commission,
which is considering whether to implement the guidelines.
   Runkel has been accused by reporters of giving them misleading
or incomplete information.
   An FBI investigation ordered by Thornburgh of unauthorized leaks
of information about a criminal probe involving the office of Rep.
William H. Gray III, D-Pa., named Runkel as a ``secondary source''
of the story. Thornburgh defended Runkel's conduct, but the
disclosure of his close aide's role proved politically embarrassing.

<HEAD>Outpouring of Fan Affection for Sammy Davis Jr.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sammy Davis Jr.'s losing fight with
cancer has elicited a torrent of affection from fans, ranging from
phone calls to tourist pilgrimages to the entertainer's home.
   ``The outpouring of love from friends, those we know and those
we don't, has been almost overwhelming,'' Davis' wife, Altovise,
said in a news release Monday. ``I want to thank everyone who has
sent thoughts and prayers to Sammy. It means so much to him and to
our family.''
   The couple marked a wedding anniversary Friday.
   ``I'm so grateful that we were able to share our 20th
anniversary last Friday at home together,'' Mrs. Davis said.
``Sammy continues to rest comfortably at home. Everything possible
is being done for him.''
   There was no change Monday in the medical condition of the
64-year-old song-and-dance man, said his publicist Susan Reynolds.
   Outside Davis' gated estate, television news crews, reporters
and photographers kept a vigil.
   Tourist vans rolled past slowly each hour with occupants
pressing against the windows and taking snapshots.
   Davis' doctor, Irving Posalski, confirmed over the weekend that
Davis was dying from throat cancer and that he was surrounded by
family. The entertainer was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in March and his condition has deteriorated since.
   Leanne Peckham, representing a group called Friends of Sammy
Davis Jr., set up a telephone hotline late Friday for well-wishers
wanting to send Western Union mailgrams to Davis. It costs $6.75
for a 55-word message.
   There were 498 calls Saturday, the last day a count was
available, said Virginia Reese of Western Union's central office in
Los Angeles.
   Davis, first diagnosed and treated for carcinoma of the throat
last September, suffered a recurrence of the cancer earlier this
year.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Monday ordered
a gradual reopening of six Palestinian universities in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which were closed shortly after the
Palestinian uprising began 2{ years ago.
   The move is likely to improve Israel's relations with the United
States. They have been strained in recent weeks over Shamir's
increased settlement activity in the occupied lands and his refusal
to accept U.S. Middle East peace proposals.
   The army closed Palestinian institutions of higher learning
shortly after the anti-Israeli uprising broke out in December 1987.
The government said the universities were hotbeds of anti-Israeli
violence.
   The United States and Western Europe sharply criticized the
measure as collective punishment. The European Parliament at one
stage recommended scientific cooperation with Israel be frozen
until the universities and colleges were reopened.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, paramilitary border
police fatally wounded a 19-year-old Palestinian after masked
youths attacked the patrol with knives and axes, the army and Arab
reports said.
   Hospital officials identified the slain youth as Hamis Abdel
Rahman Abu Husah, from the Shati refugee camp.
   His death raised to 657 the number of Palestinians killed by
soldiers during the 29-month-old rebellion. At least 212
Palestinians have been slain by their Arab brethern on suspicion of
cooperating with Israeli authorities. Forty-three Israelis have
also died in the violence.
   Also Monday, Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a founder of the Jewish
settlement movement, began serving a five-month sentence for
killing a Palestinian during a stone-throwing incident.
   Levinger is the second settler sentenced to prison for killing
an Arab since the uprising began. The Israeli Information Center
for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories reported that in that
time 29 Palestinians were killed by settler gunfire.
   Shamir spokesman Avi Pazner said the prime minister instructed
his adviser for the occupied lands, Shmuel Goren, to meet with the
heads of the six universities to discuss conditions of the
reopening.
   Goren said the first university would open within two days.
There are five universities in the West Bank and one in the Gaza
Strip, with a total of 18,000 students.
   Goren said authorities were encouraged by the declining
bloodshed in recent months but also warned the heads of
universities that if violence recurs, the facilities would be
closed immediately.
   ``I'm not sure they can control their students. But at least
they promised that they can do it. If they (the students) use these
institutions as a base for violence, we will not be able to
continue,'' Goren told The Associated Press.
   Underground leaders of the uprising have said in recent leaflets
resumption of studies was a top priority and that students should
not give the army an excuse to close facilities.
   Pazner and Goren denied the decision to reopen schools was aimed
at appeasing the Bush administration.
   ``We hope it will bring us a good reaction from the United
States and Europe, but our main consideration was security,'' Goren
said.
   Sari Nusseibeh, considered by Israel to be one of the leaders of
uprising, said Israel was responding to pressure from the United
States and Europe to reopen the universities.
   ``It means that they (the Israelis) are beginning to yield to
pressure,'' Nusseibeh said. He noted Czech President Vaclav Havel
brought up the issue in talks with Israeli leaders during a recent
visit.
   Throughout the closure, instruction has continued in so-called
underground classes. But attendance of the makeshift classes was
sporadic, and the education they provided was far below the normal
standards. Especially hard-hit were science students who had to do
without lab facilities.
   The six universities are Bethlehem University, Islamic
University, Bir Zeit University, Hebron University, An-Najah
University and Jerusalem University. It has two branches _ Abu Dis
College of Science and Technology and the Ramallah Community
College.

   A partially blind man was charged Monday
with first-degree murder and sexual assault in attacks on three of
four children he had been baby-sitting.
   Authorities were still gathering evidence in the case involving
the fourth child, a 7-year-old girl, and other charges might be
filed later against Lenard Johnson, 37, said Montgomery County
State's Attorney Kathryn Dobrinic.
   The prosecutor said she planned to seek the death penalty if
Johnson is convicted of murder in the stabbing death of 11-year-old
Donald L. Buske of nearby Litchfield.
   Three girls, ages 7, 11 and 13, were taken to a Litchfield
hospital for treatment and observation and later released.
   Johnson was released from a Springfield hospital, where he was
treated for an apparently self-inflicted knife wound to the stomach
and cuts to his wrist, shortly before a court hearing in Hillsboro.
   He faces two counts of first-degree murder, one accusing him of
killing the boy with intent; the other, of committing the murder in
the course of another felony _ home invasion. He also is charged
with two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault.
   ``I think the evidence will show that he had cared for the
children earlier in the evening and he was taken home and then
returned to the home later'' and broke in and committed the crime,
Ms. Dobrinic said in a telephone interview.
   Circuit Judge E.C. Eberstacher read the charges to Johnson and
told him he could expect a minimum sentence of six years in prison
if found guilty of any of them.
   Johnson displayed no emotion. He only nodded yes or no in reply
to the judge's questions.
   Eberstacher scheduled a bond hearing for Tuesday and appointed a
lawyer for Johnson.
   Neighbors described Johnson, who lived alone, as a familiar
figure often seen walking. They said he collected disability
payments because of his impaired vision.
   One neighbor, Dave Belt, said Johnson told him he had moved from
the Chicago area several years ago to ``get away from the crime and
violence of the city.''
   Authorities said the boy and the 7-year-old girl were siblings,
and the two other girls had been visiting them for the night.
   The children's ordeal began Friday night after the boy's mother,
Susan Emerson, got off work about 10:30. She and her husband,
James, went out, leaving the children with Johnson.
   When the parents returned home, they found everything apparently
normal and Emerson took Johnson back to his own home.
   But while he was out, authorities said, Mrs. Emerson's
7-year-old daughter told her mother she had been assaulted. When
Emerson returned, the couple took the girl to the hospital, telling
the other children to lock the house and let no one inside,
according to police and neighbors.
   The hospital advised police of the assault.
   After the parents left, Johnson sneaked back to the house,
tearing open a screen and lifting a front window to enter,
authorities said.
   Once inside, authorities contend, Johnson killed the boy, then
assaulted the two girls, isolating himself in the bathroom with
them briefly after police arrived. The standoff ended about 15
minutes later, and police said they found Johnson suffering from
stab wounds.

<HEAD>Bush Has No Plans to Ask for Changed Endangered Species Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House, rejecting complaints by
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, said Monday that President Bush
does not want to weaken the nation's primary law protecting
endangered animals and plants.
   ``We have no plans to change the act at this time,'' White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Later in the day, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell also
assured there would be no such move.
   Lujan expressed concern last week that the 17-year-old
Endangered Species Act was threatening jobs and economic
development.
   ``It's just too tough an act, I think,'' Lujan told the Denver
Post. ``We've got to change it.''
   Asked if Lujan was at odds with Bush on the matter, Fitzwater
said, ``It means he (Lujan) gave his views and they're important,
but there's been no decision to make any change.''
   Bush has said he wants to be known as ``the environmental
president.''
   In a speech in the Senate, Mitchell said Lujan was mistaken when
he claimed the Endangered Species Act was used to block development
or threaten jobs.
   He said only three projects in every 10,000 were withdrawn or
canceled between 1979 and 1986 because of concerns about the
welfare of a species.
   In 1987, the General Accounting Office reviewed over 3,000
consultations related to the effects of water projects in the West
on species and found that none was canceled as a result, said
Mitchell.
   ``The Endangered Species Act also provides an exemption process
to balance economic and conservation interests when an
irreconcilable conflict exists between the needs of the species and
the necessary federal action,'' said Mitchell. ``It has only been
used twice in the act's history.''
   Mitchell said ``mankind benefits from the enormous diversity of
plant and animal life on our planet'' _ for instance, 40 percent of
all medicines have components derived from plants.
   ``Who among us, Secretary Lujan or anyone else, can now predict
which of the obscure plants and insects or animals now being
decimated may hold the genetic key to the next medical miracle?''
he said.

<BYLINE>By GWEN ACKERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cabinet on Monday approved an emergency
plan to spend an additional $1.25 billion to absorb the 150,000
Soviet Jews expected to arrive this fiscal year.
   The funds, if approved by Parliament, would be an increase to
the 1990 budget that earmarked $900 million to help resettle an
estimated 40,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants. No date has been set for
the vote in Parliament.
   The new immigration package includes $50 million for housing,
$56 million for education and $8 million for job training.
   David Boaz, the director of the Finance Ministry's budget
division, said that under the emergency spending plan, the
government would build 45,000 units of public housing, up from
3,000 last year.
   Boaz said most of the units would be built in Israel's central
region, from the cities of ``Ashkelon to Haifa to east Jerusalem.''
   This appeared to be in contradiction to statements by Housing
Ministry officials that no construction would take place on
occupied territory.
   Arab east Jerusalem was captured along with the West Bank from
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel annexed east Jerusalem
and declared the united city the nation's capital. The United
States has said the status of Jerusalem should be negotiated in
peace talks with the Arabs, and opposes Jewish settlements on
captured land.
   Boaz said the most difficult problem in resettling the Soviet
Jews was in providing jobs for the immigrants, many of whom are
academics and technicians and face stiff competition from a highly
skilled Israeli labor force.
   Israel has a 9 percent unemployment rate, and Labor Ministry
officials have said it was ``well above that'' for university
graduates.
   The 13-member Cabinet of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
transition government voted on each item of the plan. Each section
won the approval of at least 10 ministers.
   ``We succeeded in getting across the sense of emergency, that
Israel is not prepared for this flood of immigrants,'' Boaz said.

<TEXT>
   Andrei P. Kirilenko, a former Politburo member who
once was believed in line to succeed Leonid I. Brezhnev as Soviet
leader, has died, the official news agency Tass reported Monday. He
was 84.
   Cause of his death Saturday was given by Tass only as a ``grave
illness.'' Reports of Kirilenko's ill health surfaced when he
dropped from sight in September 1982 and his retirement from the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo, where he had been a full member
since 1962, became known a month later.
   After Kirilenko retired, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko
became leading candidates to succeed Brezhnev. Andropov was named
Soviet leader upon Brezhnev's death on Nov. 10, 1982, and Chernenko
succeeded Andropov when he died in 1984.
   Kirilenko, who had close ties to Brezhnev dating to the 1930s
when both shared regional party duties in the Ukraine, served for
seven years as party leader in the industrial city of Sverdlovsk.
   When Brezhnev succeeded Nikita S. Khrushchev, Kirilenko's
stature also rose, and in 1966 he was named Central Committee
secretary for internal political questions and party work, taking
charge of day-to-day party activities.
   He also was given overall supervision of heavy industry, giving
him important connections with the Soviet defense establishment.
   As Brezhnev's health worsened, Kirilenko stood in for him at
important party functions.
   Although Kirilenko's sudden fall from power in 1982 officially
was attributed to ill health, he appeared in public to show his
respects when Brezhnev lay in state, standing far from other
members of the Politburo.
   Reports circulated that his demise actually occurred because his
son defected to the West.
   Tass did not mention any survivors, in keeping with the
traditional Soviet practice of not reporting on the personal lives
of officials.
   It said only that, ``The memory of Andrei Pavlovich Kirilenko
will be held dear to those who knew him.''

<TEXT>
   A couple who had just vowed to love each other
for richer or for poorer were robbed at gunpoint of about $13,000
in cash and gifts, plus their car, just after they left their
wedding reception, police said Monday.
   Still shaken from the robbery, Anthony and Diane Rohr, both 22,
left for their honeymoon Sunday on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.
   ``I made sure they did,'' Antoinette Rohr, the groom's mother,
said in a telephone interview Monday. ``Why should they suffer
more?''
   ``If they stay here, they'll think about it. By being away,
maybe they can put it behind them,'' Mrs. Rohr added.
   The couple was still clad in their wedding finery when four
ski-masked gunmen forced them and two relatives from the car as it
was stopped for a red light early Sunday, police said.
   Their 1989 car was commandeered by the bandits, who also got
away with cash and checks worth $13,000, as well as the bride's
bouquet and the top of the wedding cake. The car was found
abandoned later Sunday, police said.
   Police declined to say what, if anything, was left in the car.
   Authorities were questioning residents in the area where the car
was found to see if any witnesses saw the bandits, said police Sgt.
Joseph Piriano.
   He said detectives had some leads they were working on, but
refused to give any details.
   The newlyweds were waiting at the red light when a car driven by
the bandits pulled in front of them.
   Two of the bandits, carrying handguns, broke the driver's side
window of the Rohrs' car, placed a gun to the driver's head and
demanded money from the group, police said.
   Also in the car were Rohr's brother, Billy, and his wife, Maria,
who is five months pregnant.
   ``They took the bride and threw her on the pavement,'' William
Rohr Sr., the groom's father, told the Daily News. ``How could
anyone do that on a wedding day?''

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, possibly aiming for
joint German elections as early as December, met with East German
Premier Lothar de Maiziere on Monday to discuss the pace of
unifying the two countries.
   Kohl, staggered by state election losses Sunday, was concerned
about his plan for speedy unification.
   He said in Bonn before flying Monday to West Berlin he was
certain his conservative Christian Democratic Union party would
have ``good chances'' in an all-German election. De Maiziere leads
Kohl's sister party in East Germany.
   De Maiziere said after their 3{-hour meeting that he and Kohl
discussed the coming introduction of the West German mark as the
East German currency and the treaty that will link the two states
on the way to unification.
   The draft of the unification treaty guarantees private
ownership, competition and unfettered pricing practices. A copy of
the treaty was obtained by The Associated Press.
   Kohl told reporters in West Berlin the unification process must
proceed step by step.
   He said he and de Maiziere did not discuss a date for an
all-German election, adding that such talks would come later.
   ``It was a talk between friends in a friendly atmosphere,'' Kohl
said.
   In Bonn, Kohl said federal elections are still planned for Dec.
2 in West Germany, but hinted they could turn into elections for a
united German government instead.
   As recently as April 28, Kohl told his European Economic
Community colleagues in Dublin that joint elections were expected
late next year, rather than this year.
   Kohl noted Monday that in East Germany ``there are discussions''
about having all-German elections this year.
   The chancellor had conceded a ``bitter defeat'' in Sunday's vote
as he spoke to reporters in Bonn after a strategy session with
other Christian Democratic leaders. The opposition Social Democrats
won control of the upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat,
through election victories in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia
and Lower Saxony.
   This could strengthen Social Democratic chances of defeating
Kohl in December federal elections.
   The lower house, the Bundestag, is the actual law-making body.
   But Bundesrat approval is needed for legislation that has direct
consequences for the finances of West Germany's 11 states. That
could give Kohl weighty problems as he tries to push through his
unification plans.
   The election setback came amid another jolt for Kohl _ failure
of a team of experts from both Germanys to agree on key aspects of
unification.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats have been trying to put the
brakes on Kohl's push for rapid unification, which they say
threatens the jobs and pocketbooks of Germans in both countries.
   East German Social Democrats said in a statement Monday that the
election outcome means ``the influence of Social Democratic
policies on the unity process has become distinctly greater because
of the election outcome.''
   ``The social fears of people in both parts of Germany may no
longer be ignored.''
   Expert delegations from both Germanys late Saturday completed
the draft of a state treaty that is to serve as a basis for an
economic, currency and social union of the countries by July 2.
   But West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel conceded a
touchy issue _ whether to let West Germans buy up East German
property _ was tabled.
   ``Negotiations will be continued this week on a political
level,'' Vogel said Sunday.
   Failure to agree on how to transfer East Germany's state-owned
property and industries to the private sector indicates de Maiziere
is reluctant to allow West German interests to buy up East
Germany's vast state-owned holdings.
   De Maiziere, like Kohl, favors a quick shift to a free market
and fast unification.
   But he has been under pressure from East German Social
Democrats, who are part of his governing coalition, to seek more
social guarantees for East Germans and slow the talks.

<TEXT>
   Masked men wearing camouflage clothes
and ski masks burst in on a high-stakes dice game and opened fire
Monday, killing four people and wounding three.
   It was a day for street violence and mourning in other cities as
well: Gunmen with automatic weapons killed one man and wounded
seven people on the edge of San Francisco's Chinatown, and Chicago
police charged a man with killing two officers the night before.
   In Fort Worth, the gunfire erupted about 7 a.m. at the Glass Key
Cafe, a bar in a poor neighborhood known to police as a gambling
and drug hangout and the scene of a similar attack in October.
   Four men broke into the game, shouted ``task force,'' and began
shooting, police said.
   Up to 15 people were inside.
   Some scrambled into a back room and others ran outside to escape
the gunfire, said Police Chief Thomas Windham.
   ``It appears to have been a robbery of a gambling game,''
Windham said. ``We have information that it was an extremely
high-dollar gambling game with tens of thousands of dollars
involved.''
   The chief didn't know if the gunmen got any money before
escaping in a car.
   Two people were killed inside; two were pronounced dead at a
hospital.
   The clothes and ``task force'' reference could have been
intended to make the gamblers think they were being raided by
police, said Police Capt. Randy Ely. He noted similar tactics were
used in a March attack on another gambling spot in which one person
was slain.
   Monday's attack also was similar to a shooting Oct. 2, when
several men hid inside the Glass Key and opened fire on gamblers,
Ely said. One man was killed. No arrests have been made and police
are unwilling to say if the shootings are related.
   The Glass Key is home to illegal gambling, drug deals and
violent crime, Windham said.
   The bar's owner, Albert Huey You, told reporters two men entered
the lounge, robbed several patrons who were sitting around drinking
coffee, and then began firing what he described as semiautomatic
weapons.
   He said a shotgun pellet nicked his ear.
   In San Francisco, a group of people leaving a nightclub about 2
a.m. were attacked by at least one gunman spraying automatic
weapons fire.
   Police said they were seeking three men in the attack outside
the Purple Onion nightclub in the North Beach district, on the edge
of Chinatown. All the victims had Asian surnames said authorities,
who declined to speculate on the motive.
   A man about 35 years old was killed, and seven other people were
wounded. The most seriously hurt was Margaret Lee, 26, who is three
months pregnant. She was in serious to critical condition after
undergoing surgery for a hip wound, said a spokeswoman for San
Francisco General Hospital.
   Five others were treated for less serious gunshot wounds at the
hospital and one was treated at the scene. The dead man's name was
withheld.
   In Chicago, two veteran police officers, longtime friends and
partners, were shot to death after being called to quell a Mother's
Day argument between a man and his grandmother.
   Investigators said Officers Gregory Hauser, 43, and Raymond
Kilroy, 47, called for backup officers. Authorities released few
other details.
   The grandson, Roman Chavez, 23, was charged with two counts of
murder and one count of armed robbery, the latter for allegedly
taking one officer's gun. Investigators had yet to determine if
that was the gun that fired the fatal shots.
   In the Fort Worth case, the dead were identified as Robert L.
Satterwhite, 30, of Austin; James W. Lacey, 56; Joe D. Wafers, 54;
and Timothy V. Carter, 45, all of Fort Worth.
   A 30-year-old man was in critical condition at John Peter Smith
Hospital. A 20-year-old still was in fair condition at the
hospital. A 17-year-old male left the hospital against medical
advice with abrasions to his arm.

   Police on Monday arrested two members of a group
of blacks who allegedly cracked the skull of a Vietnamese man
during a confrontation punctuated by racial slurs.
   The crime was classified as a bias assault, but Police
Commissioner Lee Brown stressed that it was not a premeditated
attack, having grown out of a chance encounter.
   The fight also wasn't related to a black-led boycott of two
nearby Korean-American grocery stores, Brown said.
   Sunday's attack exacerbated tensions in a city where race
relations are under such strain that Mayor David Dinkins, the first
black ever to hold the office, made a televised appeal Friday for
an end to bigotry and hate.
   Also Monday, two juries continued deliberating in the
Bensonhurst racial attack case. Two white youths are charged with
murder in the death of a black teen-ager killed by a mob he
encountered in the predominantly white Bensonhurst neighborhood.
   The grocery boycott began Jan. 18, after a black woman allegedly
was roughed up by workers in one of the stores because she had
refused to let them look in her purse. Though boycott organizers
insist it isn't racially motivated, pickets outside the stores have
shouted anti-Korean slurs.
   The two teen-agers arrested Monday live near the scene of
black-Vietnamese melee in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn.
   Ulner Alsaint, 18, was charged with felonious assault and
possession of a dangerous instrument, a claw hammer, Brown told
reporters. A 13-year-old girl, whose name was withheld, was charged
as a juvenile with criminal mischief.
   Alsaint is accused of hitting Tuan Ana Cao over the head,
fracturing his skull. Cao was listed in guarded and stable
condition at Kings County Hospital, where he was interviewed by
detectives from the police bias squad.
   Brown said the incident began early Sunday, when about 10 black
teen-agers leaving parties gathered in front of an apartment
building.
   The 13-year-old girl threw a beer bottle, shattering a window in
the ground-floor apartment.
   ``Six Vietnamese men were eating at a table close to the
window,'' Brown said. ``Some of the Vietnamese men left the
apartment to find out what happened and a dispute erupted.''
   Each side accused the other of starting the trouble, and each
accused the other of having at least one knife, though no knives
were found.
   The blacks screamed ``Koreans get out of America!'' and other
slurs against Koreans, Chinese and Japanese. Because of that, the
crime was classified as bias-related.
   ``There's absolutely nothing to suggest that they went to that
location because of Asians being in that apartment,'' Brown said.
There also was no indication the teen-agers had taken part in the
grocery boycott, he added.
   Alsaint, who told police he carried the hammer for self-defense,
said he struck Cao while defending himself.
   In a goodwill gesture, a group of about 25 black high school
students went shopping Monday at one of the stores under boycott,
the Red Apple, led by history and economics teacher Fred McCray.
   McCray, who is black, said the students ``came to me and
suggested we do something to change this.''
   ``Why teach the children to hate one another?'' asked one
student, 18-year-old Darrell McDuffie.
   In the Bensonhurst case, separate juries deliberated
second-degree murder and other charges in the Aug. 23 death of
Yusuf Hawkins, 16.
   The defendants, both 19, were Keith Mondello, accused of being
the ringleader of a mob that attacked Hawkins and two friends with
baseball bats and a pistol, and Joseph Fama, accused of firing the
fatal shot.

   Rival Christian fighters traded gunfire
as artillery barrages in east Beirut raged until nightfall Monday.
Twelve people were killed and 55 wounded in the clashes, police
said.
   The deaths raised to at least 954 dead and 2,677 wounded the
toll since rebel army Gen. Michel Aoun moved against Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia on Jan. 30 in a bid to seize control of the
Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   Shells fell on east Beirut, the Christian sector of the capital,
from nightfall Sunday to nightfall Monday, trapping tens of
thousands of civilians in underground shelters for a sixth day.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite
Catholic sect, to which both leaders and most of their fighters
belong, issued a new cease-fire appeal.
   ``Stop this mad bombardment of the last 24 hours. Lay down your
arms to force your commanders to go to the negotiating table,'' the
patriarch said in the appeal broadcast by Christian radio stations.
   Sfeir's appeal had no immediate impact. The thunder of shell
fire continued well after its broadcast.
   Beirut's independent An-Nahar daily reported Monday that efforts
by Iraq to broker a truce between Aoun's troops and Geagea's
militiamen have failed because ``the conflict has passed the point
of no return.''
   Iraq has supplied arms to both Christian factions, which oppose
Syrian President Hafez Assad. Syria maitains some 40,000 troops in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Iraq is Syria's main Arab rival and has sought to thwart Syrian
ambitions in Lebanon to take revenge for Assad's open support of
Iran during the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war.
   Aoun's troops and Lebanese Forces militiamen fought with
automatic weapons in alleyways of east Beirut's Badaro and Sin
el-Fil districts.
   They also lobbed hand grenades at each other's fortifications in
hit-and-run raids, police reported. But neither side gained any
ground.
   The two sides have fought each other to a virtual stalemate
since the clashes began. The Lebanese Forces remain in control of
more than two-thirds of the Christian enclave.
   Police said Aoun's 155mm howitzers in the Metn mountains
overlooking the capital pounded coastal positions held by the
Lebanese Forces in and around the port cities of Jounieh and Byblos.
   Geagea's militiamen responded with barrages of rockets fired
from mobile 40-barreled launchers.
   Clouds of smoke from burning buildings shrouded the already
devastated neighborhoods along the Mediterranean coastline and the
hills around the shell-battered presidential palace in Baabda,
where Aoun has his headquarters.
   Communiques from Aoun's command said four Lebanese Forces tanks
were destroyed in Kesrouan province, northeast of Beirut.
   The Lebanese Forces claimed in a communique that its militiamen
infiltrated into Aoun's territory south of Kesrouan and ambushed a
convoy of Aoun's crack 8th brigade, ``killing all its occupants.''
The communique gave no details.

<TEXT>
   Judges in two notorious human
rights cases have absolved all but three of 17 defendants, most of
them military men.
   Only two of those still facing charges Monday _ one in each case
_ are in custody and subject to trial. A third is at large.
   The cases involve the 1988 massacre of 10 peasants and the
kidnap-for-profit of several businessmen.
   While attention has been focused on the six Jesuit priests slain
by soldiers last November, developments in these two cases have
gone virtually unreported. Each, however, at one time was
considered a crucial test of a judiciary supposedly reformed to
foster respect for human rights in a society chararacterized by
widespread violation of such rights.
   The main motive for Vice President Dan Quayle's visit to El
Salvador in February 1989 was to impress on the goverment and
military Washington's expectations regarding prosecution of the
case known as the San Francisco massacre.
   On Sept. 21, 1988, soldiers of the Jiboa Battalion rounded up
suspected collaborators of leftist guerrillas in the hamlet of San
Francisco, 25 miles east of San Salvador.
   According to extensive testimony from soldiers, a detail
blindfolded seven men and three women, tied their hands behind
their backs and marched them off.
   About a mile down the trail, the soldiers halted their prisoners
and bunched them together. Witnesses said Sgt. Rafael Villalobos
detonated a mine he had placed next to the campesinos, then joined
other soldiers in spraying the dead and wounded with assault rifle
fire.
   The army first reported the 10 deaths as guerrillas killed in
combat. Then it said the peasants were killed by guerrillas in an
ambush of the army column escorting them.
   But a week after Quayle's visit, the military _ faced with a
mountain of evidence _ said Maj. Mauricio Beltran was responsible.
   After 20 months of compiling evidence and taking testimony,
Judge Alcides Guandique dropped charges against seven defendants
but ruled Beltran and Villalobos had to stand trial for murder.
   An appeals court absolved Villalobos on the ground he limited
himself to carrying out Beltran's order.
   The higher court also noted what it called technical errors in
reporting investigation results.
   Beltran's trial by jury is not expected for at least two months.
According to U.S. officials closely following the case, his
conviction is far from assured.
   Those same officials reacted with disgust to the appeals court
ruling, but would not be quoted for the record.
   Late last month, authorities dismissed charges against six of
eight men charged with participation in a ring that kidnapped at
least five wealthy businessmen between March 1982 and February 1986.
   An army major and three lieutenants were among the eight men
indicted. Those four and the four civilians charged were friends or
associates of cashiered army Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson.
   Only three of the eight defendants were captured, and one of
them escaped last year.
   Along with D'Aubuisson, founder of the governing ARENA party,
the defendants were linked to rightist death squads that killed
thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. D'Aubuisson has
denied such involvement.
   Judge Jorge Serrano, who was handling the case and who
reportedly turned down offers of bribes to dismiss charges, was
killed by a death squad on May 11, 1988.
   San Salvador's 3rd Criminal Court cited lack of evidence in
dismissing charges last month against six defendants, including
three current or former army officers.
   The court ordered a trial for former army Lt. Isidro Lopez
Sibrian, who is in jail, and businessman Orlando Llovera Ballete,
who escaped.
   The National Association of Private Enterprise, to which several
kidnap victims belonged, reacted angrily to dismissal of charges.
   ``The decision demonstrates a lack of responsibility of some
judges who allow themselves to be influenced by those who wield
pressure of individuals or of groups,'' said the association, and
asked the Supreme Court to investigate.
   The court, in full-page newspaper ads, responded that the
judiciary was independent and that the association should mind its
own business.

<TEXT>
   Former Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov
will not be tried for abuse of power until after June's national
elections, the first free balloting in more than 40 years, the
chief prosecutor said Monday.
   Zhivkov, 78, was ousted as president and Communist Party leader
in November after 35 years of autocratic rule.
   Bulgaria's Communist Party, like most other communist parties in
eastern Europe, has begun to call for democratic reforms and has
targeted its previous leaders as responsible for many of the
failures of the past.
   Zhikov has been charged with misappropriation of state property,
inciting ethnic hostility _ ethnic Turks were the target of a
violent assimilation campaign under Zhivkov _ and abuse of power.
   Misuse of state property, the most serious charge, carries a
maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.
   Investigations against Zhivkov are scheduled to conclude by May
18.
   Chief Prosecutor Evtim Stoimenov said it would be impossible to
begin a trial against the former leader until after the two-stage
national elections, scheduled for June 10 and June 17.
   Zhikov is in detention.

<HEAD>Commission Rejects Complaint Alleging Illegal Donations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission, voting along
partisan lines, has rejected allegations that a political action
committee for foreign car dealers made illegal contributions to two
Republican Senate campaigns in 1988.
   The commission did allege a lesser violation against one of
those campaigns, that of Florida GOP Sen. Connie Mack, saying it
failed to disclose information about its donors in the final days
of the campaign.
   The Mack campaign agreed to settle the case by paying a $3,500
fine, according to commission records released Monday.
   The agency's decisions on the major allegations were made in a
closed meeting six months ago. But they were not made public until
Monday because of the confidential negotiations with the Mack
campaign on the lesser allegation.
   The case involved the Auto Dealers and Drivers for Free Trade
PAC, which spent more than $3 million to influence 1988
congressional elections, relying heavily on so-called independent
expenditure campaigns.
   The commission's general counsel had urged the commission to
open an enforcement action by accusing the Auto Dealers PAC and the
Mack campaign of violating election laws. That recommendation
alleged a $326,000 advertising campaign by the PAC supporting Mack
did not meet the standards for independent expenditures and
therefore was an illegal contribution to Mack.
   But the six-member commission's three Republican appointees
refused to accept the recommendation; four votes are needed for the
panel to begin an enforcement action. Two Democrats voted to accept
the recommendation; one was absent.
   In the case of the second campaign, the unsuccessful 1988
re-election bid of Nevada Sen. Chic Hecht, the commission voted 5-0
to accept the general counsel's recommendation to dismiss the
allegations made by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   That group's election-eve complaint alleged the spending by the
Auto Dealers PAC on behalf of Mack was illegal because there was
coordination between the PAC and the campaign.
   Mack was in a close race with Democratic Rep. Buddy McKay, and
the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee unsucessfully sought a
pre-election ruling from the commission ordering the PAC's Florida
spots off the air. Mack ultimately won by just 35,000 votes of more
than 4 million cast.
   PACs and other groups are allowed to pay for ads and other
materials supporting or opposing candidates, but such efforts
qualify as independent expenditures only if there is no contact or
coordination with the campaigns.
   If there is coordination, the ads would be considered
contributions and subject to limits. The dealers' PAC already had
donated the maximum amounts to Mack and Hecht before launching the
advertising campaigns.
   In its complaint, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
said that the PAC and Mack campaigns both had hired the same
advertising firm, Multi-Media, and a Texas-based political
consultant, Karl Rove. And it said the Auto Dealers PAC's $521,000
effort to support Hecht used ads virtually identical to official
Hecht ads, suggesting collaboration.
   In response, the dealers PAC said it retained Multi-Media and
Rove for 1988 campaign activities but hired a separate firm for the
Florida ads. Still, the FEC general counsel said the PAC failed to
prove there was no coordination and recommeded the commission open
an enforcement case.
   The commission's reasons for rejecting the recommendation were
unclear. The panel traditionally includes in the public record a
statement explaining its vote but has yet to do so.
   In recommending dismissal of the portions of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee dealing with Hecht, the FEC's general
counsel said the PAC's ads were similar to official campaign ads
but ``not of a likeness which would indicate cooperation or
coordination.''

   An earthquake shook a 450-mile section of
central and southern Chile on Monday afternoon but no casualties or
major damage was reported, authorities said.
   The Seismological Institute of the University of Chile said a
quake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale struck at 5.34 p.m. EDT
and was centered 80 miles south of Santiago.
   Preliminary radio and police reports indicate the quake caused
only minor damage at some old adobe houses in the rural zone south
of the capital.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   A quake measuring 5 on the scale is capable of causing
considerable damage.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A synthetic version of an AIDS virus fragment
may be tested later this year to determine if it can protect unborn
babies from developing AIDS, a New York researcher announced Monday.
   Dr. Arye Rubinstein, professor at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in New York, said studies in his lab have shown that
mothers infected with human immunodefiency virus (HIV), which
causes AIDS, will not pass the disease to their unborn if their
immune system develops a particular type of antibody.
   Rubinstein said the body's immune system makes this antibody in
response to a specific protein found in the gp120 molecule, which
is part of the surface of the HIV virus. That specific protein is
called the principle neutralizing domain, or PND.
   In a paper published in the May issue of the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, Rubinstein said his laboratory was
able to correctly identify infants who would become HIV-infected by
assessing the level of this PND antibody in their blood of their
mothers.
   Rubinstein said that blood samples from 15 women, all at high
risk for HIV infection, were analyzed for the presence of the PND
antibody. Later, babies born to these women were given blood tests
at regular intervals for a year.
   All of the mothers tested positive for the HIV virus, but only
11 of the 15 babies born to these women developed the disease. And
each of the four babies that remained disease-free was born to a
mother whose prenatal blood tests showed a high level of the PND
antibody.
   ``This study provides ... evidence that protective antibodies
might prevent infection by HIV in the developing fetus,''
Rubinstein reports in the paper.
   In a talk Monday at the Town Forum on AIDS sponsored by the
Institute for Advanced Studies in Immunology and Aging, Rubinstein
said his group plans to conduct trials later this year of a vaccine
that uses a synthetic version of the PND protein.
   Rubinstein said his group would use the synthetic PND protein in
a vaccination of pregnant women who test positive for HIV. It is
hoped, he said, that the protein would stimulate the women's immune
systems to produce the antibodies.
   ``This approach could provide immunity to fetuses of women who
are infected with the HIV virus,'' said Rubinstein.
   The study will be conducted in a clinic in South Bronx, but no
date has been set for the vaccine trial to begin.

   Customs authorities at Frankfurt
Airport confiscated 37 tons of machinery suspected of being parts
for a ``super cannon'' destined for Iraq, West German television
reported Monday.
   The brief report on the ARD television network said 17 cases
containing various equipment were seized by customs officials.
   The shipment originated in Belgium and arrived in Frankfurt via
Switzerland. The cases were slated to be picked up by Iraqi Airways
in Frankfurt, ARD said.
   The report said authrities suspect the seized equipment could be
parts for Iraq's so-called ``super cannon.''
   According to the report, the machinery was declared as oil
industry equipment. The ARD report Monday night gave no other
details.
   Spokesmen for the Frankfurt Prosecutor's office could not be
reached late Monday to comment on the report. Border police and
customs officials at Frankfurt Airport declined to comment.
   Authorities in Britain, Italy and other European countries have
made similiar seizures of Iraqi-bound equipment in recent weeks.
   Italian investigators are probing whether steel parts seized in
Italy could be parts of the ``super cannon'' that is allegedly
capable of firing nuclear or chemical warheads into Israel and Iran.
   After meeting with Italian officials, Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz on Monday said the steel parts were needed for
petrochemical projects.
   Authorities last week announced the seizure of nearly 100 tons
of steel tubing and other parts about to be shipped out of Italy to
Jordan to be transported overland from there, presumably to an
assembly point near Baghdad.
   The Italian Foreign Ministry said only that Italian Foreign
Minister Gianni De Michelis met with his Iraqi counterpart Aziz but
did not say what they discussed.
   Aziz was in Rome to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   Nearly all the seized components came from a foundry in the
Umbrian city of Terni that is part of ILVA SpA, a state-owned
company that is the world's fifth-largest steelmaker.
   Police officials on Saturday said it appeared the Terni foundry
was making pieces that would make up the rear end of a giant
artillery gun. They theorized that the section was to have been
assembled in Iraq and joined to the front end, alleged pieces of
which were seized in Britain several weeks ago.
   On Monday, prosecutors in Terni said an Italian is being
questioned on suspicion of illegal arms trafficking in the case.
They said interrogation of foundry technicians and managers was
continuing.
   Aziz on Monday called reports about an Iraqi super gun ``a big
lie, which originated from London.''
   Iraq said Monday it would take legal action against Britain,
Italy, Turkey, Greece and any other countries that take ``illegal''
measures to stop imports of equipment purchased by Iraq.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted an
unidentified Industry Ministry spokesman as saying the parts were
purchased from European companies, and paid for.
   Also on Monday, British Broadcasting Corp. television reported
in London that an Iraqi government official has acknowledged that
executed journalist Farzad Bazoft informed Iraqi authorities of his
plans to visit a weapons plant.
   The London-based journalist for the Observer weekly newspaper
was arrested in September while investigating reports of a major
explosion at the Al-Iskandaria military complex south of Baghdad.
   Bazoft confessed to spying on Iraqi TV, but retracted the
confession at his trial. He was hanged March 15.
   The BBC quoted an unidentified Iraqi minister as saying Bazoft
applied for official permission to visit the complex. The BBC said
it was the first such Iraqi acknowledgment.
   Bazoft was a stateless Iranian who traveled on British papers.

<TEXT>
   The government on Monday decreed
strikes by public workers illegal, urged an immediate return to
work and threatened to fire anyone who does not comply.
   Unemployed Nicaraguans said they would be glad to take the jobs
of the striking public workers.
   Labor Minister Francisco Rosales accused the recently ousted
Sandinistas of fomenting the strikes to hobble the 19-day-old
government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, and gave
workers until Tuesday to return to work.
   Sandinista labor leaders said they would widen the strikes on
Tuesday, shutting down telephone service, public transportation,
schools and banks if the government did not back off from its
threats.
   ``There will be an escalation of the strikes, and we hope we
don't have to paralyze the country, because we have the capacity to
do it,'' Lucio Jimenez of the Sandinista Workers Central told
reporters.
   He also said an attorney was petitioning the Supreme Court
asking that the Labor Ministry decree declaring the strikes illegal
be revoked.
   ``We're still not calling a general strike; we're giving
dialogue and negotiation an opportunity,'' Jimenez said.
   But he added: ``As long as there is no solution, we can't
disarm. The strike is our weapon.''
   Rosales, in a news conference broadcast live on national TV,
said the government made the decision after efforts to negotiate an
end to the strike failed.
   He said negotiations in progress since last Friday had been
blocked several times by ``hotheads.''
   ``It's a matter of them (Sandinistas) trying to torpedo the
negotiations,'' he said, adding: ``It is very clear to us that this
is a political problem, not a labor one.''
   ``Now the way out of this problem is in the hands of the
Sandinista Workers Central and the National Union of Employees,''
Rosales said.
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo said about 10,000 public
workers out of 150,000 nationwide were on strike.
   Workers are demanding either a 200 percent raise or a minimum
monthly salary equivalent to $150. They also want a law
guaranteeing their rights reinstated, and guarantees that there
will be no retaliation against the strikers.
   Nicaragua's currency, the cordoba, has been devalued four times
in less than a month and retail prices have soared. The workers
earlier rejected a government offer of an across-the-board 60
percent pay raise.
   Airport workers have also threatened to join the strike.
   Since Thursday, airport employees have been on a partial strike,
handling only passenger flights. All other duties _ diplomatic
pouches, air freight, mail and customs _ have been put on hold.
   A complete strike could close Managua's international airport.
   On Monday morning, workers at the Finance Ministry were holed up
inside the building and about 200 people waited outside to pay
their taxes or start work.
   Some people in the crowd shouted to the strikers: ``Bums! Go
back to work!''
   Six anti-riot police vehicles, including one with a tear-gas
grenade launcher, arrived and an officer with a loudspeaker told
the crowd to disperse.
   Judicial workers also were on strike Monday.
   With Nicaragua's high unemployment, it is unlikely the strikers
could shut down the system. Estimates of the unemployment rate run
as high as 45 percent.
   ``If they don't want to work, we want to work. Why don't they
give us those jobs?'' said Alba Yeni Mendoza, an unemployed typist
with two children whose husband is in jail.
   Mrs. Mendoza was in a group of about 25 women standing in front
of the presidential building, demanding to speak with Mrs. Chamorro
about their imprisoned relatives.
   Mrs. Chamorro decreed an amnesty when she took office April 25.
   Carlos Lopez, president of the Regional Committee of the
Unemployed, said his group had 3,000 members and ``we're willing to
fill those jobs.''
   He also attributed the strikes to the Sandinista Front which
Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition defeated in the Feb. 25
elections.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says Free Trade Agreement Can Be Reached With Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A free trade agreement with Mexico could take
less time to negotiate than the one with Canada, the Mexican
ambassador said Monday.
   ``We can go faster. I think the key issues are going to be
fewer,'' Gustavo Petricioli, Mexico's ambassador to the United
States, told the Border Trade Alliance.
   ``If we can agree on the fundamentals, the basis of our
positions on both sides, we can move very, very fast.''
   Members of the alliance, a loose-knit group of business leaders
and government officials from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and
California, said Petricioli's message was another sign Mexico is
serious about doing away with trade barriers.
   ``It's happening. You can see the countries cooperating,'' said
Gene Gibbs, chairman of a Brownsville, Texas, bank.
   The two countries are informally negotiating free trade,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has said.
   ``It's not going to be like some member of Congress makes a
speech `We're going to have free trade manana.' That's not going to
happen,'' said Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas.
   Some trace the beginning of the U.S.-Canadian agreement, which
took effect last year, to a 1965 agreement largely freeing trade in
automobiles and their components between the two countries. Others
say the two countries worked on free trade for about 10 years.
Serious negotiating did not begin until after Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney made an agreement a major policy goal in 1986.
   Mexico and the United States have not made a similar commitment
to negotiate an agreement.
   Despite greater cultural differences, Petricioli said a free
trade agreement between the United States and Mexico could be
achieved much more quickly because the Canadian agreement would
provide a model.
   But he said, ``We are looking for a good deal for Mexico, not
any deal.''

   Alexander Dubcek on Monday rejected the idea
that he might have averted the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia with more caution or adroitness in pursuing ``Prague
Spring'' reforms.
   ``The short answer is that I wouldn't have done it differently
... it would have been against the needs of our people,'' Dubcek,
Czechoslovak Communist Party chief at the time of the invasion,
told a news conference at the U.S. Capitol.
   ``I must say I am very pleased that I have kept my principles
because if I hadn't, I would be in the shoes of other people who
just can't face their people any more,'' he added, referring to
ousted leaders in Poland and Hungary.
   Dubcek was restored in Prague's peaceful revolution last winter
as federal assembly president after living for two decades in
political disgrace and isolation. He said his efforts a generation
earlier to create ``socialism with a human face'' were
indispensable.
   The proof, he said, is that today ``I can face the people in the
public squares'' _ unlike now-discredited orthodox communists in
other Eastern European countries.
   Commenting on the new democratic government's probes of the past
two decades of hardline rule, he said he is against ``collective
guilt,'' meaning communists should be judged by specific actions,
not party membership. He said he did not know the details of recent
Prague demonstrations calling for ex-leaders to be punished, and
noted that measures are being taken to recover wrongly-diverted
stolen public assets.
   While efforts are being made to identify those former comrades
who signed the letter inviting Warsaw Pact armies to intervene in
Czechoslovakia, Dubcek said, ``it doesn't really matter how many
signatures there were. Nothing can justify the invasion, which was
the doing of the respective countries ... a decision of the
governments of the participating countries.''
   Czechoslovakia was invaded by units from Poland, Hungary, East
Germany and Bulgaria in addition to the Soviet Union.
   Lithuania and the other Baltic republics seeking independence
from Soviet rule need should engage Moscow in prolonged
negotiations and take pains to avoid provoking the Soviet military,
Dubcek told Vice President Dan Quayle, according to Quayle's
spokesman.
   The meeting with Quayle concluded Dubcek's first trip to North
America for talks with U.S. and Canadian government, legislative
and business leaders. The Czechosovak official was flying home
aboard a government plane during the night, aides said.
   Vice Presidential spokesman David Beckwith described as ``a good
meeting'' the Quayle-Dubcek talk of more than 30 minutes. Citing
long delay for Congressional approval of urgent U.S. aid for
Nicaragua and Panama, the vice president asked Czechoslovakia to be
patient for clearing of final Congressional action to allow its
goods to gain U.S. tariff concessions on its goods known as ``most
favored nation'' treatment, the spokesman said.
   At the time of the Prague Spring, Dubcek said, Czechoslovakia's
traditions of democracy and scientific and industrial skills made
it ripe for changes even though ``we attempted something not
possible for us to reach at that time.''
   Dubcek, a backer of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's reform
movement, appealed for understanding of ``Gorbachev's difficult
legacy'' of economic, domestic and foreign relations problems.
   ``It is necessary to alter views about the Soviet Union and not
be against everything there,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union ``needs help in many fields, diplomatic,
economic and political first of all,'' Dubcek added.
   Czechoslovak and Soviet conditions are very different, he said,
but the two countries today share aims of democratization,
decentralizing their economies and easing divisions between the
people and the state.

   Iran has given an encouraging reply to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's letter about stalled peace efforts,
Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, indicated Monday.
   Aziz said he discussed the status of peace talks during a
90-minute meeting Monday evening with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, who has proposed holding direct talks between the
two nations.
   Perez de Cuellar and Aziz came to Rome for the meeting.
   Aziz announced last week that Hussein sent a letter to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, but said only it was a letter of
peace.
   Observers said Saddam proposed new negotiations over the status
of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the dispute over which led to the
8-year-long Iran-Iraq war. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the
war in 1988, but peace talks faltered over sovereignty over the
waterway and Iran's demand for a withdrawal of Iraqi troops still
on Iranian territory.
   Aziz did not say if Rafsanjani himself replied to Hussein's
letter.

<TEXT>
   SALABERRY-DE-VALLEYFIELD, Quebec (AP) _ An opponent of gambling
on the St. Regis Indian Reservation was charged with second-degree
murder Monday in the death of a fellow Mohawk, two weeks after gun
battles triggered a police intervention.
   Doug George, 35, pleaded innocent to the charge in Quebec
Provincial Court and was returned to custody. George, one of five
Mohawks arrested in the May 1 killing of 31-year-old Harold
``Junior'' Edwards, surrendered to Quebec Provincial Police on
Sunday night.
   His brother, David George, 42, pleaded innocent to dangerous use
of a firearm and was released on his own recognizance.
   Authorities have yet to file charges against the other three
Mohawks arrested Sunday, Roger Mitchell, Steve Lazore and Ken
Lazore, all from the anti-gambling faction.
   Their attorney, Philip Schneider, noted that in Quebec, people
must be arraigned in court within 24 hours of their arrest.
   ``The fact that there is no sworn information after 36 hours in
detention against these three people to me is an indication they
don`t have a strong case against them,'' Schneider said.
   The strife-torn reservation straddles the U.S.-Canadian border,
reaching into Quebec and New York state.
   The Mohawks are bitterly divided over whether to allow gambling
on the reservation. Casinos provide jobs and income, but attract
outside influences.
   Members of the pro-gambling Warriors Society, a self-appointed
reservation security force, said Edwards was neutral on the
gambling issue. He was working in a yard near the scene of a
gunbattle between the Warriors and the anti-gambling faction,
according to those who found his body.
   Police estimate 5,000 rounds were fired in the fight.
   The bitter divisions that have ripped the reservation since
casinos first mushroomed on a strip of a New York state highway in
late 1988 were reflected at the packed courthouse. Mohawks on both
sides of the issue avoided speaking to each other.
   Four of the five suspects were arrested early Sunday.
   They were taken from their homes in the Quebec section of the
reservation and brought to provincial police headquarters in
Montreal, police spokesman Robert Poeti said.
   Poeti said an investigation also continued into the shooting of
Matthew Pyke, 22, who was killed the same day in the same section
of the reservation in Snye, Quebec. Pyke was opposed to gambling.
   Since the slayings, Canadian and New York state police have
sealed off the reservation with numerous roadblocks, keeping
non-residents out and effectively closing down the casinos, along
with many of the other businesses on Mohawk land.
   The reservation has been peaceful since the police moved in,
with the exception of a drug raid last week by Canadian officials,
who arrested 21 people and seized marijuana and cocaine worth
$800,000 in U.S. currency.

   A Soviet tanker leaked about 1,000
tons of crude oil off southeast Sweden after colliding with a West
German freighter in the fog early Monday in the Baltic Sea, the
Swedish coast guard said.
   It said no one was hurt in the collision about 70 miles
southeast of Karlskrona between the tanker Volgoneft 263, carrying
4,500 tons (31,500 barrels) of crude, and the freighter Betty,
loaded with potatoes.
   The tanker carried a crew of 21 and the freighter a crew of five.
   Neither ship was in danger of sinking, and the German vessel
made port with a hole in its bow, escorted by a coast guard vessel,
officials reported.
   The Soviet ship remained at sea and transferred the rest of its
cargo to a sister ship.
   Clean-up operations were under way. Six coast guard vessels,
including three specially equipped for such operations, were
attacking the slick, which did not immediately threaten the
coastline.
   The Swedish national news agency TT said the Volgoneft 263 was
hit midship by the freighter.

<HEAD>Soviet Bid for Observer Status Expected to be Approved</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade are expected to approve the Soviet Union's application for
observer status with the international trade forum, trade sources
said Monday.
   The sources, who declined to be further identified, said GATT's
council on Wednesday was likely to agree to Moscow's request to
become an observer at the market-oriented trade body.
   Such a decision would take immediate effect, enabling Soviet
representatives to attend the 96-nation council, GATT's top
decision-making body that deliberates on trade disputes and other
mainstream issues affecting global commerce.
   First-hand knowledge of changes in the world trading system are
regarded as important to back up the Soviet economic and trade
reforms being championed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Even if the application for observer status is approved this
week, the Soviet Union would not be privy to the so-called Uruguay
Round of talks, intended to draw up comprehensive new agreements to
liberalize trade in areas such as agriculture and textiles.
   Nor would the Soviet Union automatically qualify for
multilateral trading benefits enjoyed by many of GATT's full
members.
   About 30 countries are currently classed as observers, including
China, which is seeking full membership.
   President Bush last December dropped Washington's long-standing
opposition to a Soviet presence in GATT. But the United States
argued that Moscow should wait until the end of the Uruguay Round
in December before being admitted.
   GATT's council in April deferred decision pending further
informal consultations.
   The Geneva-based forum acts as a rule-book for international
trade and sponsors trade-liberalizing accords. Its members account
for more than four-fifths of world trade.

<TEXT>
   The FBI has identified about a dozen suspects in
the $200 million theft of artworks by Rembrandt, Vermeer and others
from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, a newspaper reported
Monday.
   The suspects are in various countries and federal agents are
closely watching their movements, The Boston Globe reported,
quoting unidentified sources. One suspect in the March 18 heist was
spotted recently at Boston's Logan International Airport, the paper
said.
   The FBI didn't respond Monday to a request for confirmation.
   Some suspects reportedly were named by informants; others are
individuals who have used methods similar to those of the two men
who disguised themselves as police to fool museum guards.
   They took two paintings and an etching by Rembrandt, three
prints and two charcoals by Edgar Degas, one painting each by
Edouard Manet, Jan Vermeer and Govaert Flinck, and a bronze dating
to the Chinese Shang Dynasty, 1,200-1,100 B.C.
   The thieves got into the museum about 1:15 a.m. by telling a
guard they were investigating a disturbance. They lured one guard
away from alarms by asking for his identification after saying
there might be a warrant for his arrest.
   The thieves bound and gagged the two guards and partly disabled
the museum's security system.
   Investigators said the theft may have been done under contract
because the thieves left behind works more valuable than some they
stole.
   The FBI said agents in several U.S. cities and foreign capitals
have been checking hundreds of leads, the paper said. A $1 million
reward offered by two art auction houses has encouraged tips.

   The steadily rising Red River forced more Louisiana families to
evacuate Monday and may have contributed to a murder-suicide by a
farmer. Evacuations also continued along Texas' Trinity River,
where 7,000 were urged to head for high ground.
   The Red River had started to recede in parts of Arkansas, but
100 National Guardsmen, reinforced by two helicopters hauling
sandbags, labored to prevent the collapse of a levee guarding the
town of Garland.
   Since April 15, 13 deaths have been blamed on flooding: 12 in
Texas and one in Oklahoma.
   Damage to Texas agriculture alone has been estimated at between
$500 million and $700 million during the past two weeks, since
heavy rain fell in Oklahoma and northern Texas, in the watersheds
of the Trinity and Red rivers.
   The Red River is expected to flood 600 square miles of
Louisiana, including 200 square miles of cropland, said Maj. Jack
Scherer of the Army Corps of Engineers.
   A tornado brought more misery Monday night, injuring three
people and destroying several homes near the west Texas city of
Abilene. Several buildings in the communities of Radium and Tuxedo
were destroyed, said Tracy Daniel of the Jones County Sheriff's
Department, who was unable to provide further details.
   Three people injured by the storm were treated at Hamlin
Memorial Hospital but only one was hurt badly enough to be
hospitalized, officials said.
   The flooding may have led a farmer in northwestern Louisiana to
kill his wife and himself, a neighbor said. DeSoto Parish farmer
James McMullen, 58, shot his 58-year-old wife, Billie, and then
himself Sunday, said sheriff's Capt. Marvin Melton.
   The threat of losing all of his crops may have been too much for
McMullen, said neighbor and close friend Tommy Dugan. McMullen's
300 to 400 acres of wheat and 800 to 900 acres in cotton were
threatened by flooding.
   ``I don't think it's flooded yet, but they must of been
depressed about something,'' Melton said. The couple left a note
but it did little more than detail funeral arrangements, he said.
   An estimated 250 families have or may have to flee their
Shreveport and Bossier City homes as the Red River was expected to
rise to its highest level in 45 years.
   In Texas, operators of the Lake Livingston Dam on the Trinity
River increased the release of water from the dam to make way for
the river's approaching flood crest, augmented by heavy rain
Saturday upstream at Crockett. The flood gates were opened wider
Monday to let water roar through at a rate of about 71,500 cubic
feet per second and the dam's record of 75,000 cfs, set in 1973,
likely would be topped by Tuesday, officials said. Normal flow is
20,000 cfs and anything over that causes flooding.
   ``This is the largest slug of water we've ever seen come down
the Trinity River to Lake Livingston. We're going to have to make
the largest releases we've ever made,'' said John Jadrosich,
spokesman for the Trinity River Authority.
   The river's crest, which started in the Dallas area, is expected
to reach Lake Livingston in a week, and the dam then may have to
release up to 100,000 cubic feet per second, he said.
   Below the dam, an estimated 7,000 people were urged to evacuate.
   ``What's scary is what we know is coming,'' said Alanna Shaver,
whose family left their Hardin home in favor of a trailer next to a
Red Cross shelter where 50 people had already taken refuge.
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower said flooded
regions combine to produce 33 percent of the state's wheat crop, 66
percent of the oats and 49 percent of the hay.
   Hightower said damage also includes:
   _In Houston County, 50,000 acres, including 20,000 acres of crop
land, are under water.
   _The majority of the $1.3 million wheat crop in Henderson and
Anderson counties has been destroyed.
   _The Texas prison system, largest single farm operator in the
mid-Trinity River basin, expects to lose $500,000 from flooding of
corn, cotton, grain sorghum and other crops. They expect 27,000
acres of crop and pasture land to be under water and 5,000 head of
cattle to be evacuated.
   In southwestern Arkansas, about 100 National Guardsmen
sandbagged both sides of the levee at Garland, working to patch
leaks boiling up underneath the dam, said Gary Talley of the state
Office of Emergency Services.
   ``Garland is in a serious situation and will remain so for the
next several days,'' he said. If the levee breaks, 250 to 300
houses would be affected in the town of 660, he said.
   Although the river crested Sunday, he said, ``it's going to be
the end of the week before we're really out danger down there ...
and that's provided we get no more really heavy rain.''
   Almost 1,000 people have been evacuated in Arkansas, Talley said.
   His agency estimates damage to roads and other public property
will be at least $10 million. Damage to private property can't be
assessed until the water recedes. The agency also estimates 300,000
to 450,000 acres of farmland has been damaged.
   Flooding was mostly over in Oklahoma, except for spots like Lake
Texoma, on the Texas-Oklahoma border, which rose to about 27 feet
above normal; the Army Corps of Engineers says it may be five to
six weeks before it is near normal again.
   Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon requested federal disaster aid
Friday for 36 of the state's 77 counties, saying more than $5
million in flood damage was reported to state roads and highways.
The Red Cross estimated 380 Oklahoma families were affected by the
floods.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may
visit California and Minnesota after concluding summit talks with
President Bush early next month at the White House and at Camp
David, U.S. officials said Monday.
   Gorbachev wants to meet with businessmen in both states and
perhaps speak at Stanford University near Palo Alto, Calif.,
officials said.
   An affiliate of Stanford is the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace, which has the world's largest collection of
material on the 1917 Communist Revolution in Russia and houses
noted scholars of the Soviet Union.
   ``They expressed a desire to travel beyond Washington,'' one
official said. ``Nothing has been finalized so this is just a
tentative indication of his plans.''
   The news caught officials in both states by surprise.
   ``There's no truth to it as far was we can tell,'' said Mary Ann
Seawell, a Stanford spokeswoman who said she checked with the
university president's office.
   Gorbachev and his wife Raisa have a longstanding invitation to
see former President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy in Los
Angeles. However, Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said he was
unaware of any plans for a get-together.
   Officials said the Minnesota stop would be in Minneapolis but it
was not clear what Gorbachev would do there.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota said the White House told him to
expect a decision on a Minnesota visit by Gorbachev in the next
week, possibly in the next 48 hours.
   ``I think it's bigger than the Super Bowl,'' which Minnesota's
Vikings entry of the National Football League will host in 1992,
said Perpich.
   But the governor said he had no idea what the Soviet leader
might want to see. When Perpich was asked where he would most like
to take the visitor, the governor replied, ``Hibbing, to visit my
father and mother.''
   Gorbachev is to arrive in Washington on May 30 for his second
summit with Bush, following their meeting on the island of Malta
last December. White House statements have indicated the talks
would conclude by June 3.
   Commenting on Gorbachev's travel plans, a U.S. official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``He has always said he
wants to see more of America.''
   Another official said, ``After the summit where Gorbachev goes
is purely up to the Soviets.''
   A Soviet advance team returned to Moscow late last week after
working with White House planners on an itinerary and sites for the
summit.
   The summit schedule was to have been announced Monday, but was
delayed for at least 24 hours as the White House tried to pin down
Gorbachev's post-summit travel plans.
   White House officials believe that Gorbachev will arrive at
Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Wednesday evening, May
30.
   A formal welcoming ceremony is planned the next day at the White
House, along with a State Dinner that night. During the day, Bush
and Gorbachev are to hold talks at the White House.
   June 1, the second day of their meeting, has been reserved for
signing any agreements that result from the meeting. Gorbachev also
is expected to give a reciprocal dinner for Bush.
   On June 2, the two leaders are to go to Camp David, the
presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
   Originally, Gorbachev was to have spent the night at Camp David.
However, officials say it now appears likely he will leave in the
evening.
   Gorbachev has been to the United States twice. In December 1987
he held a summit meeting in Washington with Reagan. The two leaders
signed a treaty to abolish the two nations' intermediate-range
nuclear missiles.
   Then, in December 1988, Gorbachev met with Reagan in New York.
   In a telephone interview, Reagan spokesman Weinberg said, ``No
one involved in planning President Gorbachev's visit to the United
States has been in contact with our office.''
   He recalled that Reagan, before leaving office, talked with
Gorbachev in a farewell phone call and invited him to visit.
Gorbachev also invited Reagan to visit the Soviet Union, Weinberg
said.
   He said the invitations had been renewed in subsequent
communications between Gorbachev and Reagan.

   Gov. Rose Mofford called the Legislature into
special session Monday to consider a new Martin Luther King
holiday, hoping to forestall a referendum on the issue that has
scarred the state's image.
   The bill to create a new paid holiday for state employees could
face a key Senate vote as early as Tuesday, but additional votes
could take until Friday. It would replace a bill Mrs. Mofford
signed last year to trade in the paid Columbus Day holiday for a
holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader.
   Last year's bill was ``a mistake that the legislature made,''
Mrs. Mofford said Monday.
   Asked why she had signed it with much ceremony if she considered
it such a mistake, Mrs. Mofford replied: ``You don't veto a moral
issue. I never thought that it would come to this.''
   In its present form, the bill would make both King day and
Colombus days state holidays. But opponents said they might offer
amendments to create space for a new King Day by combining separate
state holidays for Washington and Lincoln or to to offer state
employees a ``cafeteria-style'' choice of which holidays to honor.
   Controversy over a King holiday has dogged the state's
politicians for years. Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt declared a
holiday by executive proclamation as he was about to start a
presidential bid in 1986. But Republican Attorney General Bob
Corbin called it an illegal usurpation of the Legislature's role
and Republican Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded it days before it would
have taken effect.
   The ensuing uproar included protest marches, tourist boycotts
and convention cancellations by national organizations.
   The furor also fueled a recall drive against Mecham, but a
Senate Court of Impeachment ousted him on other grounds before the
recall vote could be held.
   Forty-seven states have some sort of official holiday honoring
King. Arizona has an unpaid holiday for him proclaimed by Mecham _
the third Sunday in January. The other states without official King
holidays are Montana and New Hampshire.
   The bill before the legislature would add the third Monday in
January to the list of paid holidays for state employees and retain
Columbus Day as a paid holiday.
   Adding King Day to the holiday list rather than swapping it for
Columbus Day would cost the state an estimated $500,000 to $3.5
million, but Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, said the cost was worth it
to avoid bad publicity over the lack of a King holiday.
   ``I would trade that any time for the amount of money it could
cost us in the end,'' she said, citing new boycotts including a
threatened boycott involving the National Football League's Super
Bowl. ``I'm embarrassed because we're being referred to as a racial
state.''
   Last year's measure is in legal limbo pending a statewide vote
because a coalition of Columbus supporters and King opponents
gathered nearly twice the 43,350 signatures needed to force a
referendum.
   Monday's bill would wipe out the referendum, but King opponents
and Mecham have promised to gather new signatures and force the
issue back on the ballot.
   Mrs. Mofford said she did not fear a referendum but believed
lawmakers should decide the issue.
   The state constitution gives opponents of the measure 90 days
from the time the session ends in which to gather the signatures
required for a referendum.
   Last year's bill was approved in the fall, allowing referendum
backers to gather signatures in pleasant weather and during street
fairs and football games. This year's 90-day period would take
place during summer's blazing heat, when there are few large
gatherings.
   Mecham, who is running for governor again, has promised to put
up to 4,000 of his volunteers into the field to help gather
signatures, and organizers predict they'll get the signatures
within two months.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African President F.W. de Klerk
said Monday during a Portuguese stopover on his European tour that
his country's recent reforms in apartheid were not designed to gain
international support.
   ``We're not doing what we're doing for foreign consumption. ...
Whatever the European Community does, that will not change our
policy and will not change our commitment to follow that policy to
its logical consequences,'' de Klerk said after talks with
Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva.
   De Klerk, however, warned that if the 12-nation European
Community retained economic sanctions against his white minority
government it could slow reforms of the apartheid system of racial
segregation.
   After meeting with de Klerk, Cavaco Silva told
reporters:``Portugal understands that the European Community must
give a positive sign to support the reforms.''
   Most European Community nations have opposed the lifting of
sanctions before further reforms are implemented.
   De Klerk arrived in Lisbon Monday for a two-day visit.
   Earlier this month de Klerk opened talks with an African
National Congress delegation led by Nelson Mandela and reached a
broad agreement to work for an end to political violence and
prepare the way for black entry into government.
   De Klerk's reforms have allowed South Africa to break out of
decades of international isolation because of its racial policies.
   De Klerk's nine-nation European tour is the most extensive by a
South African leader since his National Party won elections in 1948
and imposed the apartheid system. The party has held power ever
since.
   The South African leader flew to Portugal after stops in France
and Greece. He is due to leave Lisbon Tuesday for Belgium. Later
stops in the 18-day tour are planned in Britain, West Germany,
Switzerland, Spain and Italy.

   A Navy helicopter crashed into
the Atlantic Ocean just off the beach Monday, killing all four
people aboard, the Navy said.
   Their bodies were recovered Monday evening by divers who located
the fuselage of the SH-2 Sea Sprite helicopter, said Jim Kaufmann,
a spokesman at the Jacksonville Naval Air Station.
   The crash occurred about 200 to 300 yards offshore roughly two
miles south of Ponte Vedra Beach, situated a few miles south of
Jacksonville in northeast Florida.
   The downed helicopter was one of three en route from the
Atlantic Underwater Test and Evaluation Center on Andros Island in
the Bahamas to its home base at Willow Grove, Pa., said Veronica
Schauer, a Navy spokeswoman at Jacksonville Naval Air Station.
   ``We have recovered some wreckage,'' she said.
   The names of the missing crewmen were not immediately released.
The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   The helicopter was attached to Helicopter Anti-Submarine
Squadron Light 94, a reserve squadron, she said.
   One witness said he saw something fall from the helicopter
before the accident.
   ``We were watching the helicopter come up the coast when
something fell off,'' said Ronnie Ruffner. ``It came from the
front. I couldn't tell if it was someone diving out or not.''
   Duke Dubose saw the helicopter spiral and then plummet sideways
into the ocean.
   ``It looked like the back rotor quit, and it started to
tailspin,'' he said.

   Attorneys for double murderer Robert Alton
Harris argued before an appeals court Monday that he should be
spared the gas chamber because he got inadequate psychiatric advice
at his original trial.
   If the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel agrees with the
argument, it could open hundreds of cases to challenge, an attorney
for the state argued.
   Harris, now 37, was convicted of the 1978 murders of two San
Diego teen-agers whose car he wanted for a bank robbery.
   Following a long series of appeals, he was sentenced to die in
the gas chamber April 3, in the first execution in California since
1967.
   But a 9th Circuit judge, John Noonan, stayed the execution four
days before it was to take place.
   On Monday, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel that included Noonan
was asked to decide if it's proper to go back and evaluate the
competence of the psychiatric advice given the defense in Harris'
original trial in 1979. His attorneys argued the original jury
should have been told about his extensive mental disorders.
   The arguments centered on a 1985 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that
established a defendant's constitutional right to ``a competent
psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination.''
   Defense lawyers say new studies found Harris suffers from
organic brain damage, fetal alcohol effect and other traumas from
childhood and prenatal abuse.
   Harris' lawyers contend those disorders should have been
detected by the psychiatrists who aided his original trial lawyer _
and that the jury, given such evidence, probably would not have
sentenced him to death.
   The defense is asking the court to order a fact-finding hearing
in a lower court on the competency of the psychiatric advice. Their
ultimate goal is to get a new trial on Harris' sentence, if not the
murder verdict.
   The state Attorney General's office, defending the death
sentence, disputed the claims of incompetence. State lawyers went
on to argue that the claims of incompetence are beside the point
because the Supreme Court guaranteed only the right of access to a
licensed psychiatrist, which Harris had.
   Defense lawyer Charles Sevilla countered that the right to
competent psychiatric aid ``means more than a licensed warm body.''
But Judge Arthur Alarcon told him the same argument had been
rejected by three other federal courts, including two appeals
courts.
   Judge Melvin Brunetti suggested the defense was trying to expand
the scope of the Supreme Court's 1985 ruling, Ake vs. Oklahoma.
   Deputy Attorney General Jay Bloom said a ruling in Harris' favor
would open ``maybe hundreds, who knows, thousands of cases'' to
challenge, in areas far beyond psychiatry.
   ``Any expert could be subject to attack,'' Bloom said. ``Anyone
could come in and say, `I don't agree.' ... Why should someone who
comes along 12 years later be any more qualified than the original
jury?''
   The judges questioned defense lawyers closely on whether the
court could evaluate the work of Harris' psychiatrists, who gave
confidential advice to Harris' trial lawyer, Thomas Ryan, but
didn't testify.
   Alarcon noted that evidence of Harris' alleged mental disorders
might have been inconsistent with his defense at trial, which
blamed the shootings on his brother, Danny.
   Defense lawyer Michael McCabe replied that Harris' lawyer had
lacked the competent psychiatric evaluations he needed to make a
sound decision on strategy.

<HEAD>Press Institute Urging Stepped-Up Efforts To Free Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BORDEAUX, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Press Institute said
May 8 it would ask the United States, Britain and U.N.
organizations to step up efforts to get journalists held hostage in
Lebanon freed.
   Institute director Peter Gallinor noted in a speech that five
years had passed since the kidnapping of Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, and British
journalist John McCarthy.
   ``We will send messages from this assembly to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, UNESCO and the
governments of the United States and Britain asking them to
increase their efforts in getting (the hostages) released,''
Gallinor said.
   He said there was hope U.N. organizations might achieve what
others have not been able to do.
   Two American hostages were recently set free, but six other
Americans are still in captivity along with 10 other Westerners.
The hostage held longest is Anderson, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Florida, Freedom Newspapers Stock Disputes Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Florida is seeking to join the St. Petersburg Times
in a legal battle over stock dividends with a minority shareholder
group led by Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   Bass' name was also mentioned as majority owners of Freedom
Newspapers Inc. of Irvine, Calif., created a voting block to thwart
unwanted suitors.
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth filed a motion May 9 to
intervene in U.S. District Court in Tampa, saying he wanted to help
fend off an ``attack by profiteers.''
   ``In short, the Attorney General has an interest in this case
because it involves the administration of a charitable organization
in Florida,'' Butterworth said.
   Bass is working with Poynter-Jamison Ventures Limited
Partnership. The group filed suit in February against the Times
Publishing Co. and the Poynter Institute, a non-profit journalism
school that uses St. Petersburg Times stock dividends to support
its operations.
   The Bass group wants the Times to redeem certain stock in the
company, thus giving the partnership a more equitable return on its
investment.
   ``The relief sought by the Ventures partners would significantly
diminish the future resources of the Poynter Institute,''
Butterworth said.
   Bass is aligned with relatives of the late Nelson Poynter, who
founded the Institute and set up the unusual stock arrangement. The
group, which owns 40 percent of the voting stock, gets only 5.7
percent of the dividends of Times Publishing.
   The Times has refused to redeem the disputed shares, saying it
wants to protect journalistic integrity of the newspaper and the
institute.
   At Freedom, majority shareholders representing two families
asked merger lawyer Martin Lipton to create an agreement that votes
their shares as a block, essentially barring them from selling
their stock to anyone but members of the families.
   The action is meant to ``signal to anybody who is thinking of
making a raid on the company that we're determined to remain a
privately held, closely held, family company,'' Robert C. Hardie,
chairman of Irvine-based Freedom Newspapers, said May 4. The
company owns The Orange County Register, 26 other daily newspapers
and five television stations.
   Dissident shareholder Harry Hoiles has threatened repeatedly to
sell his stock to an outside party, and majority owners were
concerned that he might align himself with Bass. Hoiles was
accompanied to several Freedom meetings this year by attorney Glen
Johnson, whose firm works with the Robert M. Bass Group. Hoiles has
said he has not talked to any Bass officials about selling his
stock to the Fort Worth investor.
   Hoiles has been battling the families of his sister, Mary Jane
Hardie, and late brother, Clarence H. Hoiles, for more than a
decade in an effort to split up the company and take his share of
the assets.
   As heirs to founder R.C. Hoiles, the three families each hold
about one-third of the shares of Freedom.
   The majority stockholders contend that Hoiles is entitled only
to the value of his stock, not the assets. Hoiles lost lower and
appellate court cases to break up the assets but has said he plans
to bring the case to the state Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Nothing Improper in Comics Switch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury found The Dallas Morning News did not set
out to wreck its rival in obtaining 26 comics and features that had
been running in the Dallas Times Herald.
   The Harris County jury voted 10-2 on May 8 to reject the Times
Herald's claim for at least $33 million in damages.
   The Times Herald had contended The Morning News and its parent,
the A.H. Belo Corp., violated antitrust laws by taking over the
features in a move to drive the Times Herald out of business.
   The features, which ran in the Times Herald until last fall,
included Doonesbury, The Far Side, Dear Abby and Erma Bombeck.
   Times Herald attorney Wayne Fisher said the newspaper will
appeal.
   ``We disagree that the conduct of our competitor was legal or
proper in any way,'' the paper said in a statement. ``In fact, it
was wrong in many ways _ wrong morally, wrong ethically, wrong for
the profession of journalism and wrong for Dallas and its people.''
   Belo Chairman Robert Decherd said: ``The most important thing
now is for our two companies to go about making the best newspapers
we can and benefit the communities we serve. We feel strongly we've
been vindicated.''
   Decherd denied The Morning News intended to drive the Times
Herald out of business.
   The Morning News said it obtained the comics and features as
part of a joint venture with Universal Press Syndicate Inc. of
Kansas City, the distributor of the features, to get into the TV
programming business.
   Witnesses for Belo and the syndicate testified that Universal
Press required all its features in the Times Herald be moved to The
Morning News as part of the venture.
   The venture will use syndicate comics characters in TV programs
and commercials to encourage newspaper readership.
   The Times Herald had asked for $33 million in actual damages and
unspecified punitive damages. The $33 million would have been
tripled had the Times Herald been successful in its lawsuit.

<HEAD>Hostage Release Captures Public Attention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American public is more interested in the
release of U.S. hostages held in the Middle East than any other
news story so far this year, a survey released May 10 said.
   Forty-six percent of those surveyed said they paid close
attention to the April release of Robert Polhill and Frank Reed,
according to the Times Mirror News Interest Index.
   The index periodically measures public interest and awareness of
the news.
   The response marked the first time in 1990 that more than
one-third of the public had focused intense interest on an
individual news event, the survey said.
   Political change in Eastern and Central Europe earlier had been
the most consistently watched story, generating interest among
about 30 percent of respondents since September.
   The second most popular story in April was the celebration of
Earth Day, which 31 percent of respondents said they watched
closely.
   Stories about the Lithuanian independence movement interested 27
percent of those surveyed.
   Twenty-four percent of respondents said they closely followed
news of the Hubble Space Telescope and of difficulties in taking
the 1990 census, and 18 percent were interested in stories about
renewed inflation and rising interest rates.
   The civil war in Cambodia drew the least attention among
readers, generating interest from 4 percent of respondents. May Day
protests in Moscow interested just 9 percent, the survey said.

<HEAD>Columnist Suspended Two Weeks by Newsday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newsday suspended columnist Jimmy Breslin after
he obscenely insulted an Asian-American reporter and phoned a radio
personality to joke about it on the air.
   The 61-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist was suspended
for two weeks without pay, Don Forst, editor of New York Newsday,
said May 9.
   Breslin launched into a tirade in the newsroom May 4 after
Ji-Yeon Mary Yuh criticized his column from the previous day in an
internal computer message as sexist. In an expletive-laced
outburst, Breslin referred to the 25-year-old reporter as ``a
yellow cur'' and ``slant-eyed.'' The woman was not present at the
time.
   Breslin later was reprimanded by his editors and apologized to
the staff in a computer message.
   Forst said the paper had believed the reprimand and apology were
sufficient until hearing Breslin's on-air conversation, which
indicated ``a lack of sensitivity to what has been and continues to
be a painful episode.''
   The conversation took place May 8 with Howard Stern, a WXRK-FM
personality who is known for racial and ethnic jokes and who
tangled with the Federal Communications Commission over his
sexually frank language.
   ``I have one social problem coming out of all of this,'' Breslin
said on the air, explaining that his nephew is to marry a Korean
woman in September.
   ``Now does this mean I can't go to the wedding?'' he said.
   Calls to Breslin at Newsday and at home were not immediately
returned.
   A group of Newsday reporters, including Yuh, had asked for
Breslin's suspension or for the paper to print a column about bias
against Asian women. They had also threatened to withhold their
bylines on stories.
   After the meeting, Newsday editors listened to a tape of the
radio show and decided to discipline Breslin, New York Newsday
reported.
   The suspension was applauded by a representative of one
Asian-American group.
   ``Basically, we are glad that management had decided to do the
right thing,'' said Jeannie Park, a board member of the Asian
American Journalists Association.

<HEAD>Former Clovis News Journal Publisher Accused of Embezzlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLOVIS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Clovis News Journal Publisher James
Griffin was arraigned May 7 on a charge of embezzling more than
$20,000 from the newspaper.
   Court documents allege Griffin used the newspaper's money for
personal expenses, including $57,000 for the purchase of a $125,000
motor home and $18,421 for a Mustang convertible for his
stepdaughter.
   The Clovis Police Department filed a complaint against Griffin
on May 4 following a five-week investigation based on information
provided by Freedom Newspapers, which owns the News Journal.
   Griffin, 60, had been publisher since 1973. He resigned March 26
and was replaced by Bill Salter, former editor of The News-Herald
in Panama City, Fla.
   An affidavit filed in the case alleges that Griffin used $8,493
to build a garage for the motor home, $13,510 for personal
expenses, $10,431 for a son's expenses, $5,992 for loan payments,
$5,617 for insurance on personal belongings, $2,423 for his
stepdaughter's wedding reception and $125 for his mother's medical
expenses and personal bills.
   The affidavit said most of the checks were written and signed by
Millie Teeters, office manager and head bookkeeper of the News
Journal, upon receipt of handwritten notes from Griffin instructing
her to write the checks.
   Teeters, who was granted immunity from prosecution in the case,
said she was only following instructions from Griffin, the
affidavit said.
   She said Griffin cashed personal checks from a petty cash fund,
then took back the checks and had her reclassify the charges and
spread them to various expense accounts.

<HEAD>Newspaper Stops Publication After 76 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Clearwater Sun folded May 8, ending
a struggle with powerful metro competitors in St. Petersburg and
Tampa.
   The newspaper, founded 76 years ago, switched to weekly
publication last summer.
   ``We were unable to make an effective business,'' said a
statement from Bruce E. Coury, publisher of Clearwater Newspapers
Inc.
   The Sun's circulation dropped from more than 50,000 in 1980 to
less than 15,000. In previous years it went through a succession of
independent owners until it was bought in 1971 by Jefferson Pilot
Publications. In the mid-1980s, the Hearst Corp. bought the Sun and
four Texas newspapers.
   Hearst Vice President Roger Greer broke the news to employees,
some of whom said they were sad but not shocked.
   ``We're not dumb. We work here, we know what's going on. ... We
can see the war between the St. Pete Times and the Tampa Tribune,''

<HEAD>Munro Steps Down as Co-Chairman, Co-CEO of Time Warner</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a long-planned change of command, J. Richard
Munro said May 8 he was stepping down as co-chairman and co-chief
executive of Time Warner Inc., the media and entertainment behemoth
he helped create.
   Munro, 59, made the announcement at the first annual meeting of
Time Warner shareholders since the company he ran for a decade,
Time Inc., completed its acquisition of Warner Communications Inc.
earlier this year.
   Munro became chief executive at Time in 1980, and has shared the
chairman and chief executive posts with Warner boss Steven J. Ross
since Time bought a controlling interest in Warner and changed its
name last year.
   Munro said previously that he planned to serve as chief
executive for only 10 years. He reaffirmed last year in announcing
the deal with Warner that he intended to keep to that timetable.
   Succeeding Munro as co-chief executive is Time president
Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., 50.
   Ross, 62, becomes the company's sole chairman and plans to share
the chief executive's post for four years, when he will leave that
job entirely to Nicholas.
   Time Warner is a world leader in magazine and book publishing,
films, recorded music, TV production and cable TV systems.
   The company lost $256 million on revenue of $10.8 billion last
year, mainly because of costs associated with its purchase of a
majority stake in Warner. Nicholas said a top priority is reducing
the company's $10.8 billion debt.

   Life is a process of editing that requires
a willingness to revise, New York Times columnist William Safire
told Syracuse University graduates May 6.
   Safire advised them to edit out of their lives the temptation to
show off their knowledge, but to never edit out their passion.
   ``That's creative editing, that's what we're here for,'' said
Safire, who defined editing as ``adding shape, significance and
grace to what you do.''
   Safire received his biggest applause when he told the graduates
that he dropped out of Syracuse University as a sophomore in 1949.
   He went to work for the New York Herald Tribune, became a speech
writer for Richard Nixon, and joined the Times as a columnist in
1973.
   Safire won the 1977 Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Commentary
for his series on the financial dealings of Bert Lance, President
Carter's budget director.
   Syracuse University established a $1 million endowed faculty
chair in Safire's honor two years ago.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reinstates Libel Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court on May 8 reinstated a libel
suit filed by a former CIA-owned airline against a television
station over a report on drug-carrying planes.
   The 3rd District Court of Appeal reversed a Dade Circuit Court
decision dismissing the case against WPLG-TV and ordered a trial on
defamation claims by Southern Air Transport.
   The evidence tended to show that WPLG-TV didn't give the cargo
carrier ``a fair opportunity'' to respond to the drug allegations
in a series aired in 1987, the appeals court ruled.
   The judges agreed with the lower court that Southern Air was a
limited public figure, which in legal terms means the airline would
have to prove the station knew its story was false or aired it with
reckless disregard for the truth.
   Southern Air received widespread publicity before the series as
a supplier for U.S.-based Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's ruling
Sandinistas.
   The station's report included an informer's statement that she
watched as drugs were loaded on a Southern Air plane in Colombia.
The same woman repeated the allegations before a U.S. Senate
committee.
   Other defendants in the case are the station owner,
Post-Newsweek Stations of Florida, reporter Susan Candiotti and
four others involved in the series production.

<HEAD>Man Crashes Truck Into Buffalo News Building</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man being chased by police crashed his
pickup truck into the front door of the Buffalo News building May 7
and ran into the newsroom, demanding to see a reporter who had
written stories about his effort to avoid deportation.
   Serge M. Germano was apparently upset that his bank would not
let him withdraw $1,000, said police and reporters who witnessed
the incident. No one was injured.
   Germano was arrested on charges of reckless endangerment and
criminal mischief, four traffic violations and possession of
marijuana.
   Police Lt. Kevin Kelly said an officer saw the driver run a red
light and gave chase. The driver took an expressway downtown, got
off near the newspaper building and crashed into its front door.
   The reporter had written a series of stories between 1977 and
1985 about Germano, an Italian citizen who enlisted in the U.S.
Navy during Vietnam and then used his status as an alien to get out
of the military. A stipulation on his discharge that he could never
become a U.S. citizen led to years of difficulties with the
immigration authorities.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Claims Paper Invades Privacy by Publishing Divorce Lists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Newport newspaper's inconspicuous list of
divorces could become a test of a state's right to bar public
information from being reported by the news media.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to say whether states can put
off-limits otherwise public information by invoking privacy
concerns. A Newport divorce lawyer contends Rhode Island's privacy
law is such a shield.
   Attorney Thomas W. Kelly is suing The Newport Daily News on
behalf of a woman who wants to keep her name out of the newspaper's
monthly listing of divorces granted in Newport County Family Court.
   A hearing in the case was scheduled for May 14.
   ``The Supreme Court has opened the door for the first time,''
said Kelly, citing its June 1989 ruling clearing The Florida Star
newspaper after it published the name of a rape victim despite
state law against such publication.
   The paper was not liable for invasion of privacy, the high court
ruled, but there might be a ``zone of personal privacy within which
the state may protect the individual from intrusion by the press.''
   Rhode Island's 10-year-old privacy law provides the right to be
secure from ``unreasonable publicity'' of a fact ``which would be
offensive or objectionable to a reasonable man of ordinary
sensibilities.''
   Kelly acknowledges his chances of winning are slim, but argues
his client is entitled to privacy because she is not a prominent
figure and has not run for public office. He wants the newspaper to
``discern the newsworthiness'' of the divorces it publishes.
   Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of
the Press, said the lawsuit is frivolous. In open court, she said,
``the press' role is to act as a surrogate for that portion of the
public which cannot be there.''
   Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz, who defended
Newport socialite Claus von Bulow on charges he attempted to murder
his wife, said there is ``no possibility'' a state can bar
publication of a public record.
   ``The only way for the state to get around that is to say
divorce is not a matter of public record _ but of course it is,''
Dershowitz said.
   David B. Offer, the newspaper's editor, said divorces are
noteworthy, regardless of the people involved, because of their
effects on the community, its businesses, schools, churches and
welfare programs.
   ``Some may call that voyeurism or scandal,'' Offer said, ``but
it seems to me that if (divorces) are of interest to a segment of
the community that people have a right to read about them in a
community newspaper.''

town of Surprise to stop publishing a municipal newsletter.
   ``The town of Surprise lacks the statutory authority to engage
in the publishing business,'' News-Sun Publisher Sam Marocco said
in a letter to town officials May 8. ``We see the solicitation of
advertisements as a direct violation of state laws. Furthermore, we
have several First Amendment concerns over a government pursuing

   Mayor Roy Villanueva said May 9 he was unaware that ads had been
solicited.
   ``This didn't come up before the council,'' Vice Mayor Clark
Maxon said. ``Somebody became overzealous, knowing we're short of
funds, and thought advertising was a way to pay for the
newsletter.'''
   Town Councilman Danny Arismendez defended the newsletter.
   ``A newspaper wouldn't publish a lot of the stuff. This is
important information for our residents,'' Arismendez said.
   Surprise Today is published under guidance of the town manager.
The town pays printing and mailing costs.

<HEAD>New Pan-European Newspaper Hits the Newsstands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European, a new English-language weekly
newspaper printed in Britain, France, West Germany and Hungary, and
sold throughout Europe, hit the newsstands May 11.
   The first edition sported the front-page headline ``One Money
for Europe.'' The story reported that 60 percent of those polled in
Britain, Denmark, France, Italy, West Germany, the Soviet Union and
Switzerland wanted to see one European currency.
   It added that a majority thought Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev would be the most popular choice as president of a united
Europe. It said the second choice was President Francois Mitterrand
of France. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl shared third place.
   More than 1 million copies of the first issue were printed;
600,000 at a plant in northwest London and the rest at plants in
Roubaix, France; Hannover, West Germany, and near Budapest, Hungary.
   The paper, which costs the equivalent of 83 cents in Britain, is
being distributed throughout Europe, including Scandinavia.
   It is owned by Robert Maxwell, 66, Britain's second-biggest
newspaper publisher. The Czechoslovakian-born Maxwell has
publishing, printing and communications interests in two dozen
countries.
   In an interview last week Maxwell told The Associated Press that
with the crumbling of the East Bloc and as the 12-nation European
Community moves closer to unity, a newspaper for all of Europe was

<HEAD>No Censorship, but Control Is Another Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Censorship ended with the fall of
Nicolae Ceausescu in December, but the opposition says state
control of television and major newspapers is just as effective.
   Spokesmen for independent news outlets and parties say telling
the opposition story is extremely difficult as Romania approaches
its first free elections in 44 years, scheduled for May 20.
   The chief target of criticism is the National Salvation Front,
which dominates the interim government and is suspected by many of
seeking to bring back a milder form of communism.
   Many ranking members of the Front, including interim President
Ion Iliescu, are former Communists who had been critical of
Ceausescu. Front leaders profess democratic ideals, including a
commitment to freedom of the press.
   The Human Rights Law Group, based in Washington, D.C., said
after a fact-finding tour in late April that many Romanians
believed the Front controlled the government.
   It said the Front's advantages ``are amplified by the
government's control of television, printing presses and newsprint,
distribution of national and opposition print media, international
communications networks, and air and ground transport.''
   ``There are widespread complaints that the newspapers
distributed by the government, especially those of opposition
parties and certain independent papers, often fail to reach their
destination, are not delivered promptly or are returned when they
could have been sold,'' the monitoring group said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC, which once tried to buy 51 percent of Cable
News Network, is planning its own 24-hour news service for its
affiliates, NBC News president Michael Gartner said May 7.
   The affiliates could use the service as part of their own
broadcasts or when NBC is ``dark'' and not broadcasting. The plan
likely will be presented to affiliates at their annual convention,
on June 3-6 in Washington, D.C.
   The proposal drew praise from James R. Sefert, chairman of the
NBC affiliates' board, although he emphasized he didn't have full
details of it. He likened it to an extension of an NBC News service
called A-News, which sends affiliates news reports from NBC News
and NBC affiliates.
   NBC executives have told him in broad terms what the new service
would be and ``I think it's terrific,'' said Sefert, president of
Cosmos Broadcasting Corp. in Greenville, S.C.
   ``I really can't comment until I see the full proposal,'' he
said when asked if he thought NBC-affiliated stations would approve
the idea. ``But the outline sounded good.''
   ``It's too early to tell,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said
when asked about NBC's plan, which could prove a rival for CNN, at
least with NBC affiliates that also take CNN service.
   ``We still are studying it,'' Haworth said. ``But we've
developed very strong relationships with 220 broadcast affiliates
over the 10 years that we've been in business. We're certainly
confident that those relationships will persist.''

   WHAM-AM is sharing its frequency with
broadcasts from Cuba, apparently because of the dustup over Radio
Marti, an FCC official said.
   The Federal Communications Commission notified the station's
managers on May 8 that Cuba is broadcasting radio programs at 1180
kilohertz, the frequency used by the Rochester station.
   Rockie Patterson, an FCC electronics engineer, said monitors in
Washington, D.C., picked up the Spanish-language programs from Cuba.
   ``They have started a broadcast station on that frequency, and
we've sent telexes asking them to get off,'' Patterson said. ``We
know from intercepts of Cuban broadcasts that this is in response
to TV Marti.''
   WHAM has received complaints about the Cuban interference from
listeners as far north as Maryland, but not from farther north,
said station manager Jack Murphy.
   TV Marti has been broadcasting television programs to Cuban
audiences with backing from the U.S. government. Cuba has responded
with broadcasts aimed at people planning to visit the Caribbean
nation, Patterson said.
   ``What tourists they hope to reach, I'm not sure, because I
doubt that there are many Americans interested in going there,'' he
said.
   ``It's annoying, but there's absolutely nothing we can do about
it,'' Murphy said.

   Some religious broadcasters and churches
have been warned by federal officials about opening mail following
the explosion of a bomb sent in a package to the Christian

   ``What I've done is made a mass mailing to members of the
National Religious Broadcasters asking them to be aware of anything
suspicious that comes through the mail,'' said Cedric W. Lawrence

   Lawrence said the warning was not intended to frighten, but to

letters to 185 high-profile religious broadcasters as well as
religious groups.
   On April 27, a small package exploded in the mailroom at the CBN
complex in Virginia Beach when a guard attempted to open it. The
guard, Scott Scheeper, 33, was hit in the leg by several pieces of
shrapnel and was hospitalized for several days.
   A mail bomb exploded Jan. 30 at the church of the Rev. John
Osteen in Houston. Osteen's daughter was slightly injured when she
opened a shoebox-sized package.
   Both packages were mailed from small towns in Bladen County,
N.C., investigators said. Postal inspectors have released two
similar composite drawings of men suspected of mailing the packages.

   The collapse of the ``Massachusetts miracle''
touted by Michael Dukakis in his failed 1988 presidential campaign
is giving Republicans their best hope in years to take the
governor's office.
   But Democrats are far from doomed, and a Democratic former
attorney general who served with Dukakis now appears to be the
favorite to succeed him. After three terms as governor, Dukakis is
not seeking re-election.
   Republicans, who have been locked out of the governor's office
for 16 years, are fighting to end what they call ``one-party rule''
in the state.
   The GOP's prospects rose as a slump in the state economy and a
slowdown in tax collections led to burgeoning deficits. Dukakis and
his fellow Democrats got the blame for mismanaging the state's
finances.
   Former Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, who leads the
candidates in public opinion polls, has been a frequent critic of

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his later years, the great Ty Cobb came home
to Georgia in a fitful attempt to find peace. Now, a drama trying
to find the essence of the tempestuous Cobb has come to Georgia,
too.
   ``Cobb,'' a look at the legend by playwright Lee Blessing, is
now playing at Atlanta's Alliance Theatre, after its rookie
production last year at the Yale Repertory Theatre.
   The play is directed by Tony winner, Lloyd Richards, named best
director for the Broadway production of August Wilson's ``Fences.''
Richards is in his 11th season as artistic director of the Yale
Rep; Yale's success with the work last year led Alliance officials
to bring the production to Atlanta.
   ``It's important for me, in one sense, to take a play about Cobb
and bring it down here,'' Blessing said. ``I hope Atlantans will
take a look at Cobb _ who is from north Georgia, and more
identified with the state than any athlete ever has been ... and
recognize something in what I've created that really rings true to
them.''
   In getting the acclaimed play ready for the Alliance and for a
run at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre later this year, Blessing has
rewritten parts of the work, ``to sharpen some things up, make some
arguments stronger, make some things funnier, get rid of some dead
wood,'' he said.
   Still, the play remains a look at the tormented soul of the man
known as ``The Georgia Peach,'' the record-setting batter and
base-stealer who died renowned for his performance on the baseball
field, but vilified and virtually friendless.
   ``He developed _ and earned _ a reputation as the meanest man in
baseball,'' Blessing said.
   The audience sees four characters in argument with each other
and with themselves. Three are Cobb himself: the 20-year-old Peach,
just launching his fabulous career; the 40-year-old Ty, his playing
days nearing an end; and the 70-year-old Mr. Cobb, four years from
the grave.
   The fourth character is also, in a way, a part of Cobb: Oscar
Charleston, a gifted and fiery ballplayer known as ``the black
Cobb.'' Charleston, relegated to the Negro Leagues throughout his
long career, never won the public acclaim Cobb did, never was
documented statistically the way Cobb was and didn't make the Hall
of Fame until 1976. And the Cobb characters, struggling to mold
their myth, cannot bear to hear it.
   ``This play is, in every sense, a dispute,'' Blessing said.
``Cobb disputing with himself, disputing with Charleston, disputing
with the audience.
   ``The convention of the play is that he has an interest that
goes beyond the grave. He wants not only to have been in the record
one of the best baseball players who ever lived, but he is still
fighting for his myth.
   ``It's justifiable, I think, to create a play in which the myth
is arguing with itself, and disputing what it is to us _ and, in a
sense, pleading with us to be something better than it fears we're
making it.''
   Blessing, a devout follower of the game, hopes his audience will
learn something about Cobb the man _ and about Oscar Charleston,
too.
   ``I have been a baseball fan all my life, but it was only in
researching this play that I even discovered the name Oscar
Charleston,'' he said. ``Some of the black players still alive
today would tell you he was the best player who ever lived.''
   Still, the author of the Tony-nominated diplomacy drama ``A Walk
in the Woods'' is a playwright, not a baseball historian. And
Blessing said he has been careful to create a play with emotion,
humor and something for even ``anti-baseball fans'' _ those who
believe baseball fanatics probably ought to be committed.
   ``There's plenty here for a person who is interested in studying
a human life. There's even things for people who want to be
entertained _ honest,'' he said with a chuckle.
   Blessing called the Alliance one of the most significant
theaters in the United States. And he doesn't necessarily view
Atlanta as a double-A stop in the ascension to Broadway's major
league.
   ``I've long since stopped having New York as a goal,'' he said.
``If a play goes to New York, that's fine. But for me, the Alliance
is a goal. Yale was a goal. ... I'm very excited about resident
theater in this country, and what it's contributed.

<HEAD>The Art of Breaking a Campaign Promise</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campaign promises are not uttered under oath,
and President Bush will not lack for company should he decide to
renege on his vehement vow against new taxes.
   Ronald Reagan did it, on the same subject, at least a dozen
times _ and all without sacrificing the impression that he was an
unyielding tax cut man.
   Bush, of course, has not undone his read-my-lips, no-new-taxes
refrain from the 1988 campaign. All he has done is to ask
congressional Democrats to bargain on the budget without
preconditions, a process that is to begin today.
   Going in without preconditions does not mean that there will be
an identifiable tax increase as part of the bargain coming out;
it's a good bet that in the end, the Republican White House will
just say no.
   The reasons wouldn't have a lot to do with the sanctity of a
1988 campaign pledge. With Cold War and defense concerns ebbing,
the no-tax stance may be the best issue the Republicans have going
for them.
   Furthermore, for some conservatives it is more than an issue _
it is a policy by which they mean to starve the welfare state for
funds. There is also the dilemma of a government that has run up
massive deficits in boom times facing the prospect of a need for
more taxes just when the economy could be slipping.
   Campaign pledges are another matter. They are made by the
dozens, and they come with no vote-back guarantee. Dissatisfied
voters can only wait until the next election, and by then, the
issues may have changed and bygone promises may be forgotten.
   That is as old as politics. Cicero wrote about electioneering in
Rome, and his guidelines still apply:
   ``All men have a feeling, that they would rather you told them a
civil lie than give them a point-blank refusal ... If you make a
promise, the thing is still uncertain, depends on a future day, and
concerns but few people, but if you refuse, you alienate people to
a certainty and at once, and many people, too.''
   The damage depends on the issue.
   A promise broken by Lyndon B. Johnson was the undoing of his
presidency. Campaigning in 1964, Johnson said he was not ``about to
send American boys 9,000 or 10,000 miles away from home to do what
Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves.'' But he did, after
winning landslide election, and the Vietnam war was the burden that
led him to renounce candidacy four years later.
   Richard M. Nixon was wily enough to leave some room for maneuver
in his campaign promises. In 1968, for example, he said he would
end the war and win the peace, although he didn't say how or when.
It ended, but not on those terms. The last Americans withdrew from
Saigon in 1975, and North Vietnam took over. Nixon, who had
resigned the White House over Watergate by that time, said Congress
forced the defeat by restricting and then refusing funds for the
war.
   Jimmy Carter promised in 1976 that he'd balance the federal
budget in his first term. He couldn't come close. Reagan upped that
ante, saying he would balance it and cut taxes. He got the tax cut,
but deficits soared. Reagan blamed it on a recession and on
Congress.
   He made an art form of raising taxes while presenting himself as
the arch-foe of tax increases.
   As governor of California, he said he would not tolerate a tax
increase and declared his feet were planted in cement on the
matter. When he had to have a tax increase anyhow, he said the
sound people heard was the cement cracking.
   As president, he confounded the Democrats by championing one
giant tax cut and then approving a series of increases. Sen. George
Mitchell, D-Maine, now the majority leader, says Reagan proposed or
signed 13 tax increases, ``and in the process convinced the
American people that he was against all of them.''
   Backing off a campaign pledge is, as Mitchell said, ``a rather
commonplace occurrence in American history.''
   Nixon said last week that Bush can change his position with ``no

situation has changed and I'm dealing with it.'''
   That's one way to scrap a promise.
   In ``The Earl of Louisiana,'' A.J. Liebling recounts another,
the story of a lobbyist who sought repeal of a state tax on movie
tickets. He campaigned for Earl Long for governor on the strength
of a promise of repeal. But when Long won, he recommended extension
of the tax.
   ``The fellow went to see him and he said `I told my clients that
you said you wanted their support and you wouldn't block removal of
the tax. What do I tell them now?''
   ``You know what old Earl said?
   ``He said `I'll tell you what to tell them. Tell them I lied.'''

   Can you sing the theme to ``Green Acres?''
   Do you remember Arnold the Pig? Goofy Lisa? Mr. Haney? Oliver
Wendell Douglas?
   This Friday on CBS, they're all down on the farm again in
``Return to Green Acres,'' a made-for-TV movie with the original
Hooterville cast, save one _ Hank Patterson, aka Mr. Ziffel, dad to
Arnold the Pig, who died awhile back.
   There are three Arnold the Pigs for this production (even pigs
need stand-ins), and Eddie Albert and Eva Gabor reprise their roles
as a successful Manhattan lawyer and his ditzy wife. They played
the characters from 1965 to 1971, when CBS ended its price supports
for their make-believe farm.
   Gabor _ who is sixtysomething, dahling, and don't push your luck
by asking what digit comes after the six _ is back on the publicity
trail these days doing interviews to promote the movie special.
   At her Beverly Hills mansion a few days back, a reporter, a
photographer, a CBS publicist and Gabor's own publicist sit
downstairs waiting for Zsa Zsa's younger, ``nicer'' sister to make
an entrance.
   ``I'm sorry I'm late,'' she says, breezing into the living room
with her make-up artist trailing behind.
   Much discussion ensues about the best place to shoot photos.
Gabor keeps up two conversations at once _ one admonishing the
photographer to not get too close ``and don't shoot me from below,
dahling, always shoot a woman from up high,'' and the other with
her make-up artist, ``What do you think, dahling? I think they'll
be OK.''
   Photos done, Gabor turns her attention to the rug, where her
dogs have had an accident. ``Please don't step on the wet spot,''
she says and rings for the maid to bring a towel to cover the
offending dampness.
   The photographer leaves. The make-up artist leaves. Gabor turns
her attention to the interview, with the CBS publicist taking notes.
   ``Here we are back again,'' she says. ``Except for `Lucy,' I
don't know of any other show that's been on as much as `Green
Acres.' It's on in Africa, it's everywhere.''
   People recognize her no matter where she goes, she says,
oftentimes mistaking her for her cop-slapping sister, Sari (aka Zsa
Zsa). Being mixed up with her sister is something she has had to
deal with most of her life.
   ``It does not help to be from a family where there is so much
chaos,'' she says, and laughs. ``I walk down the street and people
yell, `Hey, Zsa Zsa,' and I say, `Not Zsa Zsa _ Eva!' ''
   Eva has been married five times, but now is single. She owns the
largest wig company in the world. She plays tennis, dines often
with pal Merv Griffin and grows a bushelful of roses and orchids.
   She employs one secretary, two maids and five gardeners to look
after her sprawling estate. ``It's a tragedy,'' she says. ``It
keeps me broke.''
   She was happy to do ``Green Acres'' revisited, she says.
   ``We are all back and kicking,'' she says. ``Pat Buttram (Mr.
Haney), said, `Everyone of us is looking at the other and saying,
`My God, have they got old.' Except for me, of course.''
   Playing Lisa Douglas is not easy, she says. ``People think
comedy is easy to do. It's not, it's harder.''
   And though she loves the part, dahling, she thinks it has
stereotyped her.
   ``Hollywood typecasts you always. It's very difficult to get out
of that. I was never given a chance to do a performance where the
audience can see that I'm a serious actress. I know I'm a good
actress,'' she says.
   When she arrived here from Budapest, Gabor signed with Paramount
Pictures and did two unmemorable movies _ ``Forced Landing'' in
1941 (``A B picture only to those too lazy to go down the
alphabet,'' she wrote in her 1954 autobiography ``Orchids and
Salami'') and 1942's ``Pacific Blackout.''
   Paramount soon dropped her. Television, however, was kinder, as
Gabor tackled variety shows, guest appearances and even Chekhov,
co-starring with Boris Karloff in ``Uncle Vanya.''
   ``I have worked since I was 16,'' she says. ``I never knew where
my next meal was coming or how. Nobody ever gave me anything. They
took.
   ``Once you do a character like Lisa Douglas, no one thinks of
you as a dramatic actress.''

   RYAN WHITE REMEMBERED: On Saturday, ABC will rebroadcast last
year's docudrama ``The Ryan White Story,'' first shown in Janary
1989, depicting the true-life story of the hemophiliac teen-ager's
battle to attend public school after being diagnosed with AIDS. It
is being rerun to commemorate White's death on April 8 at age 18.
   Singer Elton John, who befriended the youngster, will read a
tribute during the broadcast. ``He was the center of a storm that
mingled hatred, fear and ignorance in a poisonous blend,'' John
said. ``But he tolerated the venom directed at him.''

<HEAD>Love Under the Big Top: They Really Fall Hard</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laurie Reker, with the greatest of ease, fell
for Jid Gutty on the flying trapeze.
   Marcia and Luis Palacio domesticated one another; now, the two
lovebirds train tigers together.
   Circus performers traditionally have kept their acts in the
family, handing down taming, teetering and tight-wire techniques
for many generations. Now, ``outsiders'' _ performers who weren't
born into circus dynasties _ are juggling love and careers under
the Big Top, too.
   At the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, such acts
include The Palacios; The Flying Guttys (he's ``circus,'' she's
``outsider''); Tommy and Tammy Parish, natives of Neodesha, Kan.,
who love to clown around together; and American-Canadian animal act
Lee and Judith Stevens, who consider themselves parents of 16: two
kids and 14 baboons.
   ``Before, when a child was born into a circus family it was
taken for granted they would continue the act,'' Judith Stevens
said. ``Now, you're here because you are very good _ not just
because you were born here.''
   ``My father worked 43 years at something he couldn't stand,''
added her husband. ``We're here because we want to be.''
   The Stevenses met in Canada in February 1985, while working at a
different circus. They married four months later; two years after
that, they took the baboons on their ``honeymoon'' _ a working trip
to Bermuda.
   ``We're just normal people doing unusual jobs,'' Judith says.
``In a lot of ways, it can be real hard; we never go home from
work.''
   The Stevenses often travel with their sons, Alexander, 3{, and
Sebastian, 2. In all, 20 children _ newborn to 14 years old _ tour
with this community-on-wheels, which employs 150 performers and 200
other workers. School-age children study twice a day with Natalie
Osbourne, a dancer and certified teacher. Younger kids can stay at
the traveling day-care center.
   ``It's a special day for a child to go to the zoo or the circus;
my kids have that every day,'' said Judith.
   Alexander sometimes appears in the baboon act. ``He loves to do
it,'' his mother said. ``He says, `Mommy, where's my costume?'''
   But the Stevenses are no stage parents. Judith fantasizes that
her sons will grow up to be doctors or lawyers: ``Isn't that always
a mother's dream?''

   Marcia Palacio's mother never dreamed that her daughter would
work in a cage with three tigers, two lions, three leopards, two
bears, two hyenas and a wolf. Neither, for that matter, did she.
   ``My father's never seen the circus,'' said Palacio, who is from
Staines, England. ``When my mother saw me work, she went through
two packets of cigarettes. I heard her scream.''
   It all started nine years ago, when the former ballet dancer,
then known as Marcia Spence, met animal trainer Luis Palacio, a
native of Tijuana, Mexico.
   First, they became a couple; then, they became co-workers.
Marcia started tending baby animals, learning the ropes from Luis,
who had worked for circuses since he was 11 years old. In 1988, she
stepped into the cage with her husband and the big beasts.
   ``I was terrified,'' she recalled.
   But she went into it with her eyes open.
   On July 18, 1986, during another circus in England, Marcia
Palacio had watched in horror from outside the cage as a lion bit
and slashed Luis. The badly mauled trainer finally returned to work
in May 1988, with a jagged scar across his jugular.
   ``Marcia went through the whole thing,'' Luis said. ``She was
there when it happened, and there through the surgery. She nursed
me and learned to change the tracheotomy and do injections.''
   After he recovered, Ringling had an opening for a two-person
act. Despite the job hazard she'd witnessed, Marcia wanted to try
it.
   Now, Luis performs with several animals at the front of the cage
while Marcia controls the remaining animals at the rear. At the
finale, Marcia rides a tiger around the ring.
   ``It's very difficult to separate the relationship inside the
cage and outside,'' said Luis. ``Sometimes, when she makes a
mistake, I scream at her; that's how I was taught. But I'm
growing.''
   The two relax by sightseeing. But even a brave lion-trainer has
fears. Asked if they saw the Empire State Building while working in
New York City, Luis shrugged.
   ``We'd have to go up,'' he said. ``I don't like going up.''

   Going up is no problem for Jid and Laurie Gutty. Flying 32 feet
above the floor is their equivalent of a day at the office.
   Laurie had just graduated from high school in Pompano Beach,
Fla., nine years ago when she saw Jid, a native of Bogota,
Colombia, practicing his trapeze act at an Orlando campground. At
first they were just friends; it was the trapeze that made her
heart flutter.
   ``I fell in love with it,'' she said. ``Something told me it was
a way for me to do something special.''
   First time she flew, ``I cried. I was very scared of the height.
But I knew in my heart I could do it somehow,'' she said.
   After years of physical conditioning, Laurie became the only
American woman to master a triple aerial somersault.
   Now, Jid is her husband, as well as her catcher. His face lights
up when he talks about the circus _ and about his wife's
accomplishments.
   ``I love what I'm doing,'' he said. ``When an audience responds,
when people like me, I feel proud. And I'm proud of what she's
doing, too.''
   How do they balance the demands of living and working together?
   ``You have to communicate a lot,'' he said. ``You need to talk
to each other all the time on the trapeze.''
   ``It's very hard,'' said Laurie. ``You have to separate your
personal life from your professional life. And you still have to
trust each other: Even though you're arguing, you still know he's
there to catch you.''

   The danger is even present for Clown Alley veterans. Tommy
Parish ticks off accident stories involving stilts and a runaway
elephant cart.
   ``Nothing serious _ a few broken bones,'' said Parish, whose
clown cowlick and bulbous, red schnoz belie a modest, shy
personality.
   But the pratfall is no pitfall for a two-clown couple.
   Especially the Parishes, who became hard-core circus fans while
growing up together in Kansas.
   Twelve years ago, Tammy Parish was attending ``regular-people
college'' when her husband-to-be went to clown college in Florida
and won a job with Ringling. She followed his career path a year
later. Since then, they estimate they've played to more than 55
million people.
   Their clowning carries over into their personal lives.
   On Valentine's Day, Tammy sang her undying love for Tommy,
accompanied by an original accordion arrangement. Then, she hit him
with a pie that was hidden in a big, red heart. ``I can't carry a
tune in a bucket, but Tom was touched, anyway,'' she says.
   The Parishes say they have it better than other circus couples.
When tempers flare, noted Tammy, ``We have access to foam hammers.''

<HEAD>SUN CITY, Ariz.: in the sun.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``I found that 36 percent of the people aged 77 to 81 in Sun
City were childless compared to 19 percent in the nation as a
whole,'' she said.
   ``That age group's childbearing years were during the Depression
and World War II, so their productivity was low to begin with.
Still, nearly twice the national average represents quite a piling
up of childless people in Sun City.''
   No children, of course, is the way of life in Sun City. A
reporter could find no Sun Citian who admitted to missing the daily
presence of children. Most, on the contrary, said they fully
supported the rules that prohibit home ownership by anyone younger
than 55 and ban visits for more than 90 days by anyone younger than
18.
   When Sun Citians found the rules difficult to enforce they
petitoned the county zoning board, successfully, to give them the
force of law. Only 3 percent refused to sign the petition.
   ``We buy a lifestyle as well as a home,'' said one. Another
agreed, but said he was certain many who signed felt pressure from
their neighbors to do so.
   The average Sun City home among variously priced models goes for
$135,000. Eight out of 10 newcomers, equity-rich from their
previous home sale, pay cash. Nearly every household has a
late-model car, or two. The second car is often a golf cart
equipped with headlights and other requirements for street driving
_ to the supermarket and hairdresser as often as the golf course.
   Phoenix residents see Sun City's upper middle class affluence as
an obvious boon: A total net worth within those walls of $8
billion, bank deposits of $4 billion, state and county taxes of $32
million yearly.
   Even so, many in Phoenix and other towns in this valley hold
unvarnished resentment toward Sun City and all it represents.
   ``They have it made out there behind their walls and don't give
one tiny damn about the rest of the world,'' said Howard Grimes of
nearby Glendale, who is 69 and retired. ``I wouldn't care if they
all moved away tomorrow.''
   The reasons are obvious. During one 12-year period Sun Citians
united to vote down 17 of 19 school bond issues until neighboring
towns, whose youngsters were on double and triple shifts for lack
of schools, found a legal way to allow Sun City to get out and form
their own district. They voted against a county transportation
project, a beautification project, and fought for nine years to
avoid property taxes on its golf courses, swimming pools and
clubhouses, valued at $12 million, until it lost the battle last
year in the state supreme court.
   Resentment has grown so deep that last fall the Del Webb Corp.
mounted a $250,000 advertising campaign called ``Sun City Cares''
to change the image by stressing the work of Sun City's network of
volunteers, which is prodigious, and nearby schools a major
beneficiary.
   Clearly Sun City represents a potent political force. Eighty
percent of its voters are registered Republicans (as opposed to 50
percent in the state as a whole, including Sun City) but it would
be a mistake to take their votes for granted.
   Eight years ago one of their own residents, president of a local
Republican club, ran for county supervisor and lost, narrowly. His
opponent was a 34-year-old lawyer, a Democrat, a female. Four years
later the winner, Carole Carpenter, won reelection with 70 percent
of the vote.
   Ms. Carpenter, for her part, feels Sun City's locally tarnished
reputation is somewhat of a bum rap. She says she sees no great
concern by others in the county for nursing homes and long-term
care for the elderly in a state that has no Medicaid program.
``It's a two-way street,'' she said.
   Sun City's developers themselves shoved aside those predictable
and essential needs for years _ ironically, as part of a way to
rescue itself from foundering.
   About five years after it opened, Sun City's house sales fell to
the point that Webb (who died in 1974) believed his venture would
fail as so many had before, notably in Florida. He figured, as had
many in Florida, that his house prices, then about $9,000, were too
high and decided to solve the problem by adding an adjoining
trailer park, a routine Florida solution.
   He polled his residents and discovered many would leave if he
did that, so he went the other way. He opened a new section of more
expensive homes. Sales went up. The secret, he discovered, was a
feeling of exclusivity.
   ``Retirement is an unfamiliar change for everybody,'' said
Deborah Sullivan, the Arizona State sociologist. ``A vacation away
from home is not, expecially for the financially well fixed.'' What
Sun City became, then, and remains today in its promotion, is that
familiar playland for those who can afford it, a resort.
   Nursing homes just didn't fit the picture. They were as welcome
as a skunk at a picnic. Eventually, though, Sun Citians aging in
place became older, frailer. Now their average age is 73, with
three-quarters of them over 75.
   Eventually the residents themselves demanded long-term care,
opening a floodgate for entrepreneurs. Today more than 25 services
for varying degrees of care cluster around Sun City, nine of them
inside the walls along with a 350-bed not-for-profit hospital. A
corps of 1,300 volunteers provides services for patients and
families. About 250 doctors and dentists opened offices nearby.
   Availability of geriatric care became a lure rather than a
turn-off, and so did a wider selection of more elaborate houses
with each new Sun City addition. ``For sale'' signs tend to remain
longer on homes in the original section where the young-old are
less willing to move in among the old-old and the homes there are
less commodious.
   Along with Sun City's evolution into a ``resort'' grew an
increased awareness of status in a community that began as rather
classless. Two private country clubs appeared, and a private dinner
club overlooking a man-made lake. The Sun City directory lists,
along with address and phone number, the owner's former occupation.
   According to some long-time residents, an earlier gaiety, as
among vacationers, is less evident now. Like any other community,
disputes among residents are not uncommon as both they and their
city age together. A continuing dispute, over whether or not to
incorporate (so far ``not'' has prevailed in three elections) has
caused lasting enmities. One meeting became so heated two old
timers stepped behind the hall to duke it out.
   In general, though, tranquility prevails in Camelot. Perhaps
after the next 30 years Sun City's critics and champions will find
the answer to the final question, the one that troubles Sun Citians
the least.
   That is, whether the forces that shaped their place on heaven's
doorstep also work for the benefit of all of society.

   You will find no rough edges here, no
unswept driveway, no unmowed lawn, no jail.
   This retirement community and adjoining Sun City West have a
population of 65,000 _ about the same as Galveston, Texas, or
Portland, Maine, or Harrisburg, Pa. _ and are virtually crime free.
   ``About the most serious thing that happens around here is
somebody's golf clubs getting snatched off a golf cart parked at
the supermarket,'' said Norman Thaler. ``But any sort of violent
crime? No, none of that.''
   Thaler is one of 200 deputies in the Sun City West Posse.
Another 200 deputies patrol Sun City. So 400 possemen, all in
vehicles, all residents, all retired, all trained and duly
deputized by the Maricopa County Sheriff, patrol 23 square miles of
pristine streets, night and day. Troublemakers beware.
   ``We don't arrest anybody,'' Thaler said. ``If we see something
that doesn't look right we phone the sheriff. What we do for the
most part is keep trouble from happening.''
   The residents apparently approve. In every survey they list
``security'' among the main benefits Sun City offers as a place to
live out their years, especially those who came here, as many did,
from a big city.
   To keep trouble from happening, the possemen leave a note on the
eat of every unlocked car, phone the homeowner if a garage door is
left open, generally keep watch like a cop on a beat. If they see
potential trouble afoot, an unfamiliar young person, say, they keep
an eye on him.
   ``Anyone who goes on vacation or takes a trip fills out a card
for us, listing where they can be reached and who has a key to
their house, usually a neighbor,'' Thaler said. ``We check those
homes daily, about 300 right now but about 2,000 during the
vacation time from July to September.''
   The posse also provides a service specifically tailored for a
retirement community; the average age here is 73. If a person with
Alzheimer's disease strays from home in confusion, which is not
uncommon, the posse mounts a well-practiced grid search.
   So far, they always get their man.

   Kipling said they would never meet, but in
Mongolia east and west swirl together and mix and form a most
exotic brew. This land of the hordes that once swept Europe is
swept itself with Western culture. Mongolia, it seems, would be all
things to all people. Even a democracy.

   The music takes on a Latin beat. The
dancers glue their bodies together. They are doing -- yes, the
lambada, the provocative Brazilian dance that is the rage in the
West.
   The lambada? In Ulan Bator? In Mongolia?
   ``Why not?'' said Suhjargalmaa, a top editor at the official
Montsame News Agency. ``We knew about the Beatles as soon as they
appeared.''
   Not only the Beatles, but such rock and pop stars as Prince,
Pink Floyd, Phil Collins and Paula Abdul have big followings among
the hip urban youth of this communist-ruled shepherding nation.
Tapes are carried in from Eastern Europe, for decades Mongolia's
door to the world.
   But now, with the Cold War receding into history and Mongolia
learning glasnost and perestroika from its Soviet mentor,
Mongolians are eager for direct contact with the non-socialist
world.
   ``If you were to stand here and shout out that you are an
American, probably a lot of people would crowd around just to see
what you are like,'' said my translator, Orgil, a 27-year-old
Foreign Ministry worker who learned his fluent English in Moscow.
Like most Mongolians, he uses only one name.
   After decades of letting in but a few Western journalists, the
Foreign Ministry welcomed dozens early this year to witness
Mongolia's first steps toward multi-party elections expected this
summer.
   It drafted nearly every English speaker in Ulan Bator to serve
as translators, and set up special phone and telex lines that
eased, but did not eliminate, problems in contacting the outside
world. It even arranged news conferences with the country's
brand-new opposition parties.
   Geographically, historically and politically, Mongolia still
hovers in uncharted territory between its Stalinist past and
hoped-for democratic future. Geographically, it stands along the
Chinese-Soviet border where it harbors the Gobi Desert. Long under
Chinese influence, it slipped into the Soviet sphere relatively
recently. Historic home of the Mongol hordes that swept Europe, it
uses the Greek-derived Cyrillic alphabet of the Slavic countries
and the Soviet Union. Contradictions abound. They always have.
   For example, among our translators were several people
identified by their colleagues or opposition party members as
having secret police connections.
   The words ``Long Live the Mongolian People's Revolutionary
Party,'' the formal name of the communists, still dominate a
hillside over Ulan Bator in yards-high stone letters _ evidence
that the party believes in loosening up but not giving up.
   The close Soviet-bloc tie is another part of the past that won't
easily be erased. It is stamped on the face of Ulan Bator _ in the
stolid Soviet-style buildings, the central square that imitates Red
Square, the Soviet-made Volga and Lada cars.
   It was the Soviets who taught Mongolians to eat potatoes and
bread and drink vodka with their traditional mutton. Television
viewers can pick from Mongolia's one station or the Soviet channel.
Almost all trade is with the Soviet Union or its other allies _
shops sell Czech beer, Bulgarian pickle relish and East German
fashion magazines.
   The blond men dancing with the lonely wives of Soviet soldiers
in the Hotel Ulan Bator's bar are Polish, Ukrainian and East German
black marketeers, profiting from the shortages left by
state-planned economies up and down the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
They bring Chinese consumer goods to Ulan Bator, and Mongolian
cashmere to Moscow.
   The East bloc connection has Europeanized urban Mongolians,
giving them a cosmopolitan air absent from the neighboring
socialist capitals of Beijing and Pyongyang. Nowhere in Beijing is
there a bartender like bow-tied Arslan of the Hotel Ulan Bator, who
serves up nightly political commentary in English, German, Russian
and a little Japanese.
   For this European polish, Suhjarlgalmaa said Mongolians should
be grateful to former dictator Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, who married a
Soviet woman and made Mongolian-Soviet friendship a matter of
dogma. But hers is a minority view.
   My chief concern on the streets was not to be mistaken for a
Russian, so as to avoid the cold stares, poor service and hissed
obscenities directed at them.
   ``People are fed up'' with everything Soviet, one local resident
said. Mongolians are reveling in a new surge of nationalism with
Genghis Khan, the 13th-century warrior king, as their hero.
   Two hit rock songs sing the khan's praises. Artists and scholars
recently formed a society called ``Genghis Khan's Tent'' to revive
traditional culture. A taxi driver pasted a color picture of
Genghis Khan like a holy card on the dashboard of his Soviet sedan.
   The party newspaper, Unen, now prints its name in Mongolia's
ancient script as well as in the Cyrillic letters forcibly
introduced in the 1940s. Schools offer night courses in the old
script to young adults raised on Cyrillic.

   Some observers wonder if the government is encouraging
traditionalism to divert attention from modern problems, such as
economic stagnation and rising crime.
   A leading economist disclosed in April that more than half of
Mongolia's 2 million people earn only the minimum wage of 260
tugriks a month or less -- about 46 U.S. dollars.
   Industrial production fell early in the year as workers took
advantage of the political thaw to stage slowdowns and illegal
strikes. Housing, consumer goods and even meat, one of Mongolia's
chief products, are perennially in short supply.
   ``Sometimes in summer we can't get meat for two or three
weeks,'' said Orig, a retired teacher in the tiny rural town of
Hugar, southwest of Ulan Bator. He said the town hopes to open a
free market soon, adding, ``This will help solve the shortages.''
   But even Ulan Bator's twice-weekly free market offers slim
pickings to the thousands who visit it. They file hopefully past
stalls that display small heaps of salvaged screws and bolts, rusty
saws and screwdrivers, homemade picture frames and a broken
television valuable for its parts.
   Most of the customers come from nearby settlements of shanties
and gers _ traditional felt tents known better in the West by their
Turkish name, yurts. Stark and colorless, the ger-towns stretch
across treeless, grassless hills on Ulan Bator's fringes.
   Children play ball in the dirt. Residents carry buckets to
communal faucets but dig their own toilets _ sometimes badly, as
small rivulets of leaking sewage testify.
   Small wonder that the ger-towns are the cradle of youth gangs
with names like the ``Gray Wolves,'' that fight each other and are
blamed for a recent surge in muggings and rapes. Foreign Ministry
staff warned me against walking alone at night, even in the city
center.
   Neither the ruling party nor the half-dozen new opposition
groups has offered a practical blueprint for dealing with these
economic and social problems.
   Political wrangling has absorbed much of their energies. Already
the leading opposition group, the Mongolian Democratic Association
and its affiliated party, has purged its top ranks twice amid
charges of personal ambition.
   Rural dwellers make up only 37 percent of Mongolia's population,
but in this summer's legislative elections they will have the
decisive say. The ruling party, strongest in the countryside,
recently gave them more legislative seats than city dwellers.
   How much they understand or care about the recent political
changes remains to be seen.
   I asked Gonchig, a 61-year-old semi-nomadic herder in rural
Uvurhangai province, what he thought of the opposition hunger
strike in March that forced the communists to give up their
constitutional hold on power.
   ``We understood that it wasn't that they didn't have enough to
eat, that they were making political demands,'' Gonchig said
chuckling. ``Of course, to some extent they are crazy.''
   He follows developments sketchily via radio reports and copies
of Unen delivered to his ger once a week by pony express.
   Out in the rolling grasslands, away from Ulan Bator's incessant
political debates, it is easy to share Gonchig's priorities.
   ``The sight of white sheep against the green pasture is really
quite lovely,'' said Orgil, city born and bred.
   Indeed it is lovely, even when seen from a Soviet jeep that is
hurtling across the open steppe, bumping through ruts and rivers.
   Or from a Mongolian twin-propeller plane that has spun off the
gravel runway of a rural airport and become mired in the soft
steppe mud.
   In true Mongolian fashion, the 40-odd passengers indulged in no
screaming or complaining. With them, we journalists waited in the
clear, cold air as the pilot and crew dug the plane out.

   What's this? Are you sure this is New York City,
the inspirational home of ``Blackboard Jungle''? Take a look at
this high school on Manhattan's Lower East Side, a nursery for
excellence from Nobel Prize winners to Jimmy Cagney. Its pennant
``flies'' on the moon.

   In New York City, the dropout rate approaches 30
percent and armed school guards and metal detectors outnumber lunch
boxes. Around the nation, reading, writing and 'rithmatic are in
ruins.
   And then there's Stuyvesant High School.
   There is no dropout rate, no drug problem. One hundred percent
of its graduates go to college, a majority to Ivy League schools.
The football team has a 91 grade average and scored an average of
1,300 on national Scholastic Aptitude Tests; the national average
is 903.
   This one school on Manhattan's Lower East Side also boasts two
Nobel Laureates and one Fields medalist in math among its countless
prestigious alumni. Perennially, it wins more Westinghouse Science
awards and National Merit Scholarships than nearly any school in
the nation.
   ``People are always trying to figure out if we have some special
secret or formula,'' says principal Abraham Baumel. ``We really
don't.''
   Trying to figure out how Stuyvesant came to be a diamond in New
York's thorny educational crown is like debating which came first,
the chicken or the egghead. Does the school's reputation for
excellence help attract the best students or do the
cream-of-the-crop kids build the Stuyvesant mystique?
   The answers, Baumel says, are yes and yes.
   Stuyvesant students come from all over the city, some traveling
up to two hours from the outlying boroughs of Staten Island and
Queens. They represent some of the city's richest and poorest
families and their interests are as diverse as their heritages.
   But if the 2,700-member student body has a single, common
attribute, Baumel says, it's that they're highly motivated.
   ``The kids in this school pursue academics with the same vigor
most of middle America pursues sports,'' the principal says. ``When
a kid gets 100 here, kids will say, `Hey, way to go man.' It's like
the quarterback just tossed a crucial pass.''
   Indeed, trophy cases that line Stuyvesant's five floors are
jammed with plaques and trophies from math, science, poetry and
debate contests.
   Yellowing photos of students shaking hands with presidents and
governors are tacked on bulletin boards amid handmade signs for a
veal boycott, a Young Astronauts Club meeting and ads for the Comic
Book Marketplace.
   Students take courses in Portuguese, ``The Bible as
Literature,'' and ``Language Mind and Artificial Intelligence.''
``The level of work is unbelievable. The work they do is on a level
that would destroy the average college student, much less the
average high school student,'' Baumel says.
   ``If you don't work hard, there's not a place for you in this
school,'' says 17-year-old Bianca Santomasso.
   Some teachers find Stuyvesant students intimidating. ``The work
is very demanding. The kids are very demanding,'' the principal
says.
   Others are inspired. ``It's incredible. I learn from them,''
says biology teacher Roz Bierig. ``They know things that aren't
even published yet.''
   Long before specialized magnet schools became the educational
vogue, Stuyvesant _ sandwiched between ritzy Gramercy Park and a
pocket of drug-plagued projects _ was turning out some of the
nation's brightest students.
   Its eclectic alumni include actor Jimmy Cagney (class of '18);
Nobel Prize winners Joshua Lederberg and Roald Hoffman ('41 and
'55); Mad magazine editor Nick Meglin ('53); and attorney and
former chief of the Watergate task force Richard Ben-Veniste ('60).
   Air Force Col. Ronald Grabe, class of '62, spread Stuyvesant's
fame farther than anyone else: he took a 1932 Stuyvesant pennant
with him when the Atlantis space shuttle circled the globe in 1989.
   Founded in 1904 as a manual training school for boys, the school
originally catered to the sons of mostly Jewish, Italian and Irish
immigrants. Girls were first admitted in 1969.
   Baumel says the school remains a haven for immigrant strivers;
today, nearly half of the student body is of Asian descent.
   Students, evenly split between the sexes, must take an entrance
exam to qualify for admission, as they do at the city's two other
science and math schools, Bronx High School of Science and Brooklyn
Tech.

   Some 13,000 students take the exam yearly; Stuyvesant accepts
800. Because it's smaller and accepts less students, Stuyvesant's
cutoff is 50 points higher than at Bronx Science and 150 above
Brooklyn Tech's.
   The school's reputation may attract them, but Baumel credits the
kids with maintaining their own high standards.
   He illustrates the point with a story about 1988 Westinghouse
winner and Stuyvesant graduate Chetan Nayak, who taught himself the
complex math theory of tensor analysis and was doing graduate-level
math at 13.
   Baumel says that when Nayak was a sophomore, he read a paper by
noted Princeton physics Professor John Wheeler on unified field
theory in physics, called him on the phone and started firing
questions at him.
   ``You've got to understand,'' Baumel says, his voice rising in
excitement. ``Einstein is here,'' he says pointing to an invisible
top line, ``and John Wheeler is here. He's just one step below.
You're talking about one of the top physicists in the world, and he
just called him up to chat.''
   Wheeler became Nayak's mentor and guided him in the research
work that won Nayak, now at Harvard, Westinghouse's top $20,000
prize.
   But braininess is not all there is to Stuyvesant. The student
body is also known for inventiveness, spunk and charitable works.
   When one student wanted to start a lacrosse team, he went out
himself and raised $7,000 for the necessary equipment.
   Two other students convinced each of the school's 75 homerooms
to sponsor a foreign foster child. Their efforts have made
Stuyvesant the world's largest foster parent, in size and heart.
   Others have collected shoes for the homeless, made Thanksgiving
dinner for local elderly, tutored poor children in drug-plagued
projects, and served as translators for new immigrants.
   Balancing many hats has never been a problem for senior Sirish
Maddali.
   ``The popular misconception is that Stuyvesant students go home
and read the dictionary or something like that,'' says the
16-year-old Sirish. ``I play the guitar in the band, manage the
school baseball team ... I do lots of regular things. I just happen
to like science, too.''
   Sirish, a squarely built, athletic youth who hopes to become a
cardiovascular surgeon, is one of those kids who was attracted to
Stuyvesant because of its reputation; the only difference was he
was living a continent away in Nigeria at the time.
   His family moved to New York in 1986. He enrolled at Stuyvesant
in 1987 and jumped into the school's Westinghouse science program,
beginning research in the field of enzyme kinetics.
   For two years, Sirish attended 10 classes a day and then headed
straight to a professional lab where he would work at least another
five hours. Many experiments required overnight stays. He kept a
toothbrush handy.
   Weekends and summer vacation were also spent at the lab where he
became such a frequent visitor he was given his own access key, a
privilege not granted to many Ph.D. candidates.
   His work _ the euphoniously named ``A Better Statistical
Analysis by Nonlinear Parameter Estimation of the Acid Phosphatase
Activity of the Genetically Engineered Microbe W3110 (R702) in Soil
Amended with Montmorillonite or Kaolinite Clay'' _ earned him a
semifinalist spot in the Westinghouse contest. Bigger prizes await,
of course.
   In fact Stuyvesant High students dominate the Westinghouse
contest with its awards that range from $7,500 to $20,000.
   Of this year's Westinghouse honorees, 39 students came from
Stuyvesant, the most in the nation. Five of the 40 finalists came
from Stuyvesant as well. In 1988 Stuyvesant kids placed first and
second and took a record 47 spots in the 300-member honors list.
Principal Baumel brags that was more than California, Florida and
Texas combined.
   In the 49-year history of the Westinghouse, Stuyvesant had first
place seven times and 70 finalists in the top ten. Only Bronx
Science, where Jonas Salk went to school, has a better overall
record, three firsts and 118 finalists.
   Roald Hoffman, the 1981 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, was a
Westinghouse honoree in 1955.
   Hoffman fondly recalls the daily walks from his father's
Delancey Street luncheonette to the cement schoolhouse, with its
carved and bolted-down wooden desks and prehistoric lab equipment.
   The equipment remains something short of state of the art; the
building itself seems ancient, with peeling paint and worn steel
stairways. All that will change when Stuyvesant moves into its new
10-story, $100 million school in Battery Park, near the Staten
Island Ferry, in 1991.
   ``It's hard for me to imagine'' a new Stuyvesant, Hoffman said.
The old one was ``such a remarkable place.''

   Boating is getting safer, in part because of the war against
drinking while boating, but many, many more lives would be saved if
people wore life vests while on the water.
   When you're in the water, it's too late to look under the seat
and find a life vest.
   Figures from the National Marine Manufacturers Association show
that while the number of boats increased from 9.6 million in 1973,
when a record high of 1,754 fatalities was recorded, to 17.3
million in 1988, only 946 people died in boating accidents in 1988.
   That's a fatality rate of 5.5 deaths per 100,000 boats in 1988.
   ``Public opinion is turning against drinking and driving,'' says
Capt. Bill Griswold, chief of the Coast Guard Auxiliary's Boating
and Consumer Affairs Division. ``We will continue to educate the
public about the dangers of boating and drinking.''
   He said 50 percent of all boating fatalities are alcohol related.
   More and more states are recognizing the problem and passing
``boating while intoxicated'' laws.
   Whether or not a person is intoxicated, four out of every five
boating deaths is by drowning.
   Federal law now requires that every boat carry one personal
flotation device per passenger.
   Many fishing tournaments, such as those run by the Bass Anglers
Sportsman Society, require that not only must each contestant wear
a PFD while the boat is running on its outboard motor, but that the
driver's jacket be hooked to an ignition kill switch.
   A kill switch shuts off the engine if the driver is thrown
overboard. That means the boat is still in the area if the victim
can swim back to it.
   Despite those examples, ``most people simply do not believe
anything will happen to them'' and do not wear their PFDs,
according to NMMA.
   But all it takes is a bump on the head, or the shock of hitting
cold water to render a person helpless for a few minutes, and by
that time the victim may be a fatality statistic.
   Makers of PFDs have realized that making a better looking, more
comfortable PFD is a key to getting people to wear them.
   In addition to making a wide variety of PFDs for specific
purposes, such as water skiing or kayaking, they come in varieties
of colors and patterns and are lighter and more comfortable.
   PFDs for fishermen are being made with numerous pockets for
lures or other tackle.
   The Coast Guard has adopted five categories of PFDs. Here's a
rundown to help you decide which you want in your boat:
   _ Offshore life jacket: Best for open, rough or remote waters
where someone overboard may be in the water a while. It will turn
an unconscious person face up in the water. It's drawback is it can
be a bulky unit.
   _ Near-shore life vest: Best suited for boating in calm, inland
waters where a victim will be picked up quickly. It's more
comfortable, but will not necessarily turn over a person face down
in the water.
   _ Flotation aid: A lighter and more comfortable vest for use
where there will be help on the scene fast. It's the most popular
type of life vest, but it will not necessarily turn over a
face-down victim.
   _ Throwable device: This is not recommended for children and
non-swimmers. It can be a cushion, ring, buoy or any device that
will keep afloat someone who can hang onto it.
   _ Special use device: These are legal for only special uses.
They are inflatables, or combinations of permanent and inflatable
flotation. When inflated they provide the same buoyancy as an
offshore jacket, but are less reliable because they have to be
inflated and can be punctured, rendering them useless.

   Thirty years ago, Bob Kutz had a dream.
   He wanted to create a museum to show off the achievements of
sport fishermen and to keep records of those achievements.
   Today, the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame's record
book, the 1990 edition published in April, contains thousands of
records for 125 species of freshwater fish.
   Its awards program makes it possible for the average angler to
hold a certified world record.
   The program includes world records in five categories: rod-reel,
ice fishing, pole-line-no reel, fly fishing and miscellaneous
methods and state records for the United States.
   ``It's taken a lot of work by mostly a lot of volunteers over
the years,'' says Ted Dzialo, who has taken over as director. Kutz
remains active as public affairs director. His wife, Fannie Kutz,
continues as business manager.
   The hall is centered in a 7-acre complex of museum buildings and
fishing offices in Hayward, Wis.
   Its symbol is a 4{-story tall, city-block long walkthrough
fiberglass muskellunge. It's open jaw is an observation platform
that can hold 30 people.
   The museum attracts more than 100,000 visitors per year.
   Its displays range from a 150-year-old Chippewa Indian birchbark
canoe to 300 classic and antique outboard motors. In addition to
prize mounts of freshwater fish, there are thousands of lures,
rods, reels and accessories on display in the museum.
   Pools at the museum are used for children's fishing contests.
   ``We wanted something which would be pleasant to visit and yet
have all the information to tell the story of sport fishing,''
Dzialo says.
   Its records program is probably its best known ``and there still
are a lot of open places there,'' he says.
   The rod-reel division is broken down into line classes by the
test-strength of line. The bigger the fish the more line classes
for the species. Fly fishing also is broken down into line classes.
There are no line classes for what in essence is cane pole fishing.
In the ice fishing category there are records for pole-line and
tipup fishing.
   Proper records and photographs are essential for having a
potential record certified, Dzialo says.
   Here are some tips for would-be record holders.
   First, if you have a big fish on, land it yourself. Don't let
someone else touch the line. You may have someone net or gaff the
fish.
   Get the fish to a certified scale as soon as possible. These
scales, used for trade, have a seal showing the last time it was
inspected.
   Weigh the fish in front of two witnesses _ not your fishing
companions _ and get their names, addresses and signatures. Measure
the girth, fork length and total length of the fish.
   Make pictures. Color pictures are best. Hold the fish broadside
for positive identification. One trick is to lay it next to a
yardstick. If it's a picture of you holding the fish, get the
camera in close, so the fish is easily seen. They want to see the
fish, not your feet.
   Have a fisheries biologist identify the fish and give you a
short, written, signed report.
   Freeze the fish. It won't hurt it when it comes time to mount
your trophy.
   Save the first 25 feet of line, from the hook or lure, to be
sent with your application. For fly fishing, save about 15 inches
of the tippet, leaving the fly or hook attached. This is so the
line can be tested to see if it is in the line class where you
claim your record.
   (To get a world record application write or call the National
Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame, Box 33, Hall of Fame Drive,
Hayward, Wis. 53843. Phone 715-634-4440.)

   A fisherman can spend a good deal of time
pondering the impressive display of baits at a major sporting goods
store, trying to decide what to buy to fill the tackle box.
   At today's prices, you can spend the proceeds of a winning state
lottery ticket buying fishing lures. The best advice is to buy a
couple of several varieties, try them, and then buy more colors and
types of what works for you.
   This is a rundown of some basic types of lures, to use as a
guide. You may want to try some or all of them.
   The most common bait is the plastic worm. It also is about the
cheapest. It's most commonly used for bass, but is effective for
other species, such as walleye. Pick out several colors. Get a
couple packs of dark-colored ones, such as black, purple or motor
oil, a couple with two colors and couple with sparkles.
   The most effective color usually is determined by the color and
clarity of the water you're fishing, so variety allows
experimentation.
   Crankbait is a generic type word used to cover a variety of
lures. There are several varieties. Most use a plastic lip to make
them wobble and throb in the water.
   The one that doesn't is a stickbait. It floats and you must
impart action to it by wiggling, jerking or twitching your rod tip.
   Then come surface baits or shallow divers. They have small lips
which either impart wobble or pull them slightly below the surface.
   For diving crankbaits, the size of the plastic lip usually
determines the depth at which the lure will run. The bigger the
lip, the deeper the dive. The deep-divers are designed to be worked
along the bottom, digging into the mud and bouncing off branches.
   Most of these baits will float, so start the retrieve with very
fast turns on the reel to get them to working depth, then slow them
down. When they strike an underwater obstacle, lower your rod tip
to give them slack and usually they will float free.
   Another variety of crankbaits are the lipless, plastic ones
which use the top of the lure to impart diving action. These dive
to a variety of depths and often include rattles to add noise to
the vibrations designed to attract fish.
   One last variety of crankbaits are the poppers and chuggers.
They have concave faces or very wide lips and are designed to
bubble and gurgle when retrieved, usually in short jerks.
   They stay on top of the water and are best fished at dusk, dark
and dawn, imitating frogs.
   Spinnerbaits are about the most versatile lures around. They can
be fished on top or on the bottom, at almost any depth. They come
in a wide variety of colors and blade combinations. They can be
pitched right up against the bank and retrieved, surviving in
places most other lures would hang up.
   Generally, the larger the blade, the slower a spinnerbait can be
worked through the water and still stay on top. Their cousins, the
buzzbaits, are designed almost entirely for topwater use, and are
best fished in low-light conditions.
   Spoons and jigs are a unique class of lures in that most can be
fished straight up and down. Some spoons can be retrieved
horizontally, but most are designed to be fished up and down with a
flick of the wrist, imitating a dying baitfish falling from above.
   Some jigs, hooks with a lead head and maybe a bit of skirt
attached, also have a flashing spinner and are designed to be
fished naked. Others are designed to be hooked through a second
bait.
   These lures are especially effective in colder water.
   Spinners are a combination of a hook or hooks, a spinner,
possibly a bit of deer hair or rubber and a blade to flash. They
come in all sizes, from tiny ones to take trout and bluegills, to
sizes that look like dangerous weapons, designed for muskellunge.
   One more thing: Be sure put get some plain, ordinary hooks,
several sizes, from 2-0 for large bass, walleye or pike, to about a
No. 8 for small panfish.
   With hooks in your tacklebox, you can always buy a few minnows,
crickets or worms and be reasonably sure you will at least catch a
mess of bluegills for an excellent dinner.

   For bass bugs, hair is now.
   The noble art of bugging for bass with a fly rod has been
dominated by bugs of cork, balsa and plastics since the 19th
century.
   Today, bugs of hair and feathers are making inroads on the
hardbody fish foolers. They come closer to looking alive than the
standards of the past.
   Since they are soft, the fish take a millisecond or so more to
catch on to the fact they are eating something that just ain't for
real.
   Of course, there are the tried and true flyrod teasers, like the
redoubtable ``Harry Mary'' and the upscale minnow imitations like
the ``Mudlerminnow.'' But the hair bugs of today will go well past
those.
   In addition to hair poppers that are in the same body style as
the bugs of yore, that pop and gurgle as they are jerked, slid or
pulled across the surface, you can now dig a bit deeper in the
water with a diver which on retrieve plunks and submarines an inch
or so below the surface and zooms up like a wounded baitfish.
   Some have even fashioned frogs that have legs and wiggle like
they are alive.
   Hair is, at least for three-thumbed tiers like myself, easier to
shape than balsa or cork.
   Colors run the full spectrum. One of the top sellers is the deer
hair version of the always popular ``Bumblebee Bug.''
   A bass rig flyrod will be from 8 feet to 9 feet. Any more length
puts in the class with Ma Bell timbers. The line should be in the
8-to10-weight class. Some folks say they can use their midsize
trout gear, but they must lift weights.
   Casting technique has to be modified a bit to throw the larger
bugs.
   The leader, generally seven feet will work, needs to be very
stiff at the butt and again rather stiff at the tippet. Using the
one-foot Orvis braided leader link, taper it down from 30 lbs. to
20 lbs. Then a tippet of 10 lbs. or 15 lbs., depending on the cover
you are fishing.
   Fish caught on bugs, as with flies, are usually lip hooked so it
is easy to unhook and release them without damaging them.
   Though a beam will get very ambitions every now and then, the
large size of the real bass bugs, size 1 to 2 in most cases, will
keep most of the panfish intimidated and off your hook.
   The sound of a bass clobbering your bug is much like that of an
icebox hitting the water after a two-story fall. It can be
unnerving in the daylight and absolutely terrifying at night.
   If the bass is a jumper, the hair bug will be harder to throw
than the hardbody type because it is lighter. The lightness of the
hair bug also helps in casting.
   Bass don't make long runs like trout and saltwater fish, but
they bulldog down and then jump and tailwalk about, giving the
angler as much sport as you can get doing anything you let other
people watch you doing.
   Try it!

   When her husband suggested the family could use more cash,
Janice Henke got herself a job _ trapping skunks.
   ``When I come in from an unsuccessful skunk expedition, my
husband won't let me come in the house unless I take off every
stitch, including my sneakers, and hang them in the tree,'' says
Mrs. Henke, who lives far enough outside of Glens Falls, N.Y., that
there are no neighbors nearby.
   Then it's into a shower and ``I leave my clothes outside for a
week or so.''
   Most of the skunks live through the ordeal and only about one in
20 takes a shot at her with its personal perfume, she says.
   As both a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and licensed nuisance
wildlife agent, she must first decide which situation applies when
a potential customer calls.
   ``You have to decide who's distressed. Is it the people or the
creature?'' she says. ``Generally, it's the people.''
   The animal is in distress if it can't get away.
   If the animal could leave if it wanted to, but doesn't care to
just now, it's the people who are in distress.
   If it's the people who are distressed, the cost is $25 per skunk.
   Normally, it's a simple matter of setting a box trap outside the
hole the skunk is using to get under a building or through a fence.
But there are exceptions.
   ``The lady called me in a panic because, she said, `there's a
skunk in my washing machine,''' Mrs. Henke says. ``I'd never had
that before.''
   The skunk apparently fell into the machine after climbing
through a basement window broken by the woman's children.
   Skunks are a major problem in upstate New York where they are
attracted to man's warm dwellings and groomed lawns,'' said Mrs.
Henke in an interview during this year's North American Wildlife
and Natural Resources Conference in Denver. She is a lobbyist for
the National Trappers Association and executive vice president of
Furbearers Unlimited.
   As winter approaches, skunks begin to den up and sometimes a
dozen or more will hole up under a house or mobile home.
   Disputes among skunks are settled in a manner that leaves a very
unpleasant aroma for the homeowner above.
   Mrs. Henke uses a wire box trap, ``which is pretty good sized,
so when the animal considers entering it, it won't touch his sides
or back. I used a Twix bar for bait, caramel flavor.''
   Next morning, if the homeowner finds an occupied trap ``I'll
come with my skunk blanket.''
   It's an ``old yellow blanket'' with a hole in it so she can
watch the animal while she moves up on it, holding the blanket up
so it can't see a human.
   Some skunks react aggressively to the approaching blanket,
stamping their front paws.
   She waits, then lowers the blanket over the cage, ``figuring if
he's going to spray he's going to do it now or never.''
   Then she wraps the cage in the blanket, places the package in
the back of the pickup truck and takes it to a spot on state land
where ``hopefully there aren't any houses around.''
   ``Then I uncover the end of the cage, remove the door, and if he
doesn't come out by himself, I pick the cage up and give him a
heave-ho, and he rolls over and gets up and trundles off through
the woods.''
   While buildings, with such things as warm water pipes, are a
source of comfort, lawns are a source of food. Lawns are full of
grubs, primarily the larvae of June bugs and Japanese beetles, she
says.
   ``They hunt those by smell and they dig and it looks like a lawn
has been ravaged by a pick of hogs if the skunk has been really
industrious,'' she says.
   Then, it's time for the wire trap and old yellow blanket.

   The director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service sees the
challenge of the '90s as a balancing act between traditional
supporters and new constituencies _ with heavy burdens on the
scales.
   ``We're not primarily a recreation agency, but I do see us
needing to broaden our mission,'' to provide visitor recreation on
the nation's 450 national wildlife refuges, John Turner says.
   ``But we do need to continue to support the resources and the
users that are the backbone of the agency with their dollars and
their years of effort, and that's the hunters and fishermen,'' he
says.
   ``Obviously, the interests of this society are expanding to
non-consumptive uses and more total use of wildlife and we need to
expand our programs to meet those growing needs.''
   Turner, a Wyoming legislator since 1970 and operator of a
guide-outfitter service, was confirmed by the Senate July 31.
   He is in charge of managing the country's 93 million acres of
wildlife refuges at a time when ``the complexity of the issues
facing wildlife at times seems overwhelming,'' but also at a time
``when the polls show the people have never had a greater interest
in wildlife.''
   ``This is a time of great opportunity to do things for diverse
life forms, for habitat, which I think is part of America's roots.''
   ``Our main focus has got to be the wild critters and the
habitats that are entrusted to us and that gives us a full
platter,'' Turner says.
   During an interview at the North American Wildlife and Natural
Resources Conference, Turner talked about his vision for the refuge
system.
   He says he wants to expand Americans' interest in the total
value of wildlife.
   ``I'm really concerned about the future of the consumptive
users,'' hunters and anglers, he says. ``We need to teach kids how
to fish and we're failing in the mission. We need to try to bring
kids, especially minorities, into the out of doors.''
   ``We need to relate to blacks and kids out of the urban areas.
We're used to relating to a white population,'' he says.
   He is worried about the anti-hunting movement.
   ``I welcome their concern for wildlife, but their energies,
they're so misdirected and self-destructive. We ought to all be
working for the welfare of wildlife and habitat.
   ``We ought to be joining forces and save for later the question
of what to do with the surpluses and how to manage non-game
populations. (The anti-hunting movement) is just terrible
destructive, perhaps the most destructive part of the conservation
movement today,'' he says.
   Turner also said he wants to see business and the private
landowner in the conservation movement.
   ``Their good will is going to be essential to the enhancement of
the resource and we haven't always done a good job of earning it,''
he said. ``I see new opportunities to join hands with these private
landowners. That is going to be the key to whether or not we
succeed.''

   The loon is a quick change artist, switching from
its drab, smoky-gray color of winter for much more formal dress,
complete with necklace and sequins for summer in the north.
   Its haunting, penetrating call brings a vision of North
America's wilderness to those lucky enough to hear it.
   ``The loon is associated with beautiful, pristine settings;
natural lakes that aren't denigrated by pollution,'' says Carroll
L. Henderson, nongame wildlife supervisor with the Department of
Natural Resources in Minnesota, which is home to the largest loon
population in the 48 states.
   About 12,000 loons nest in Minnesota.
   The loon needs the clear, clean waters of remote lakes because
``they depend on eyesight to catch fish under water,'' Henderson
says. Introduction of carp into clear waters has hurt the bird
because the fish's grubbing along the bottom makes the water turbid.
   Its eyes are red because of a special filter to provide better
underwater vision.
   A tough, aggressive bird when it comes to protecting its nest
from wolves or other predators, the loon has enough size to deter
many animals seeking a meal.
   The common loon, the only one of four North American species
that nests in the United States, weighs 8 to 12 pounds, three times
the weight of a Mallard duck.
   Its body is three feet long and it has a wingspan of five feet.
   ``But they're set so low in the water, people don't realize
they're that big,'' Henderson says.
   The reason they sit so low in the water is their bone structure,
which helps make them superb swimmers and fish catchers _ but also
makes takeoffs difficult, if not downright hazardous.
   Loons' bones are more dense than those of most other birds,
which makes them heavier. Because of the weight, they can dive to
depths of 200 feet and remain submerged several minutes.
   The same powerful legs which make them such good swimmers are a
handicap on land. The legs are set far back on the body, behind the
balance point, so a loon has difficulty walking.
   Because of its weight, a loon needs at least 75 feet, and often
as much as two football fields, depending on weather and wind
direction, for a running, flapping, splashing takeoff.
   Once airborne, it can reach speeds of 75 mph.
   Its landing style also is different. Most water birds land with
their bodies at an up angle, their webbed feet outstretched to hit
the water like skis. A loon hits low and hard, pounding into the
water on its breast.

   A dull knife is dangerous!
   ``When your knife isn't sharp, you pull, tug, try to force it
and sooner or later it's going to slip,'' says Peter Kuhn, a knife
expert with Lansky Sharpeners of Buffalo, N.Y.
   ``That's when you get hurt.''
   For years, man got sharp edges by chipping flakes of a flint or
other crystallized stone, which often produces edges of razor
sharpness.
   More recently, metal blades have been sharpened by drawing a
stone across the blade or drawing the blade across a stone.
   The critical things for sharpening a knife is the angle at which
the knife and stone meet _ and that that exact angle be maintained
through the sharpening process.
   Changing the angle even a few degrees will lead to rolling the
edge and reducing sharpness.
   There are many types of sharpening stones. Like sandpaper, they
range from coarse _ for removing a lot of metal in a hurry _ to
ultra-fine for putting the finishing polish on an edge.
   All should be held at the same angle to the edge.
   The Lansky system solves the problem of exact angle, as do other
systems, by holding the blade in a jig or vice.
   The sharpening stones, which come in several degrees of
fineness, attach to a guide rod which feeds through a hole in the
jig. The rod keeps the stone at the same angle to the blade, stroke
after stroke.
   The jig provides angles of 30, 25, 20 or 17 degrees, ``but you
really don't need the 17 degrees for a knife, that's like a
razor,'' Kuhn says.
   He says a 25 degree angle on a blade is about the best for a
quality knife that needs a good working edge.
   It takes a little time to work a very dull blade to brilliant
sharpness and, obviously, longer blades take more time than short
ones. A jig may have to be moved on the blade of a long hip knife.
   It's best to use a jig mounted on a workbench or table top to
begin work on a dull blade. That way you have both hands free to
work the sharpening stone.
   But once you get a sharp edge on your knife, unless you abuse
it, it will take only a few strokes occasionally on a pair of
sharpening roads, or a folding V-sharpener to get the edge back in
mint condition.

   Anyone venturing outdoors this summer should be
careful of a new disease that's causing ripples of worry among
outdoor sportsmen.
   The ailment is Lyme disease, so named because it was identified
in 1975 near Old Lyme, Conn.
   The real culprit was the tickborne infection.
   There is no vaccination or cure, so the keys to fighting the
disease are insect repellents and poisons.
   Tests conducted by research entomologist Carl Schreck of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture found properly used repellents
provided 80 percent to 90 percent protection against ticks.
   The Atlanta-based national Centers for Disease Control reported
6,000 cases of Lyme disease in 1988, the last year for which
figures were available, double the number in 1987. It was reported
in 43 states.
   Symptoms are similar to many other illness, low grade fever,
fatigue, head and body pain.
   The tick bite itself usually is unnoticed. But within a month of
being bitten, a red rash appears around the bite on about
two-thirds of those bitten. Sometimes it is solid, but usually it
has a brighter outer edge and little or no color in the middle.
   Although it can vary greatly in size, up to coverage of a whole
arm or thigh, it usually is about 4 inches in diameter.
   The rash is a signal to get to a doctor for help.
   A blood test usually will confirm the disease by detecting the
antibodies the body's immune system is turning out to fight it. It
can take two months or more for those antibodies to show up, so a
test after the first couple of weeks usually produces a false
reading.
   There are two ways to get the disease _ by going into areas
infected with disease-carrying ticks, or having pets go into those
areas and bring the ticks to you.
   Use tick sprays, dips, powders and collars to help your pet
avoid tick bites.
   Proper clothing and repellents can provide nearly complete
protection when outdoors.
   Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors where they
may be ticks. Tuck pants into high socks to keep ticks from
crawling into clothing.
   Keep your boots or shoes laced up.
   Wear a hat.
   Wear light-colored clothing, making it easier to spot a tick
before it crawls through a buttonhole. Tightly woven fabrics are
harder for ticks to climb.
   Collared shirts help keep ticks from climbing up onto your neck.
   Two types of products add to your armor. First is an
insecticide, such as permethrin, which is designed to be sprayed on
clothing _ not your skin. Second is a repellent containing deet
(diethyl-meta-toluamide) which can be sprayed on clothing or
directly on exposed skin.
   Spray clothing thoroughly, especially around places like laces
in boots, at the top of boots, or where pants go into socks, places
where ticks may find entry between layers of clothing.
   Check your clothing and your body after an outing. A tick is no
larger than a good-size pinhead and can be very difficult to spot.
   If you find a tick attached to your skin, don't try any of the
old wives tales about removing ticks with a lighted cigaret or
anything else. That may cause the tick to regurgitate fluid into
the bite.
   Use a fine-jawed tweezers to grab the tick as close to your skin
as possible and slowly pull it straight out. Do not squeeze the
tick's body. That simply injects its fluids into the bite.

   The 1980s ended as a disaster for the West Indian
manatee.
   A record 174 of the huge, endangered mammals were found dead in
the United States last year, primarily because they were struck by
boats and barges in Florida waters, according to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's regional office in Atlanta.
   So far, 1990 is even worse for the sea cows.
   A record 74 manatee deaths were reported in January alone, most
of that due to the ``Christmas freeze'' that sent temperatures
plunging in north Florida.
   The service has been studying manatee deaths since 1974.
   The FWS said there were 510 deaths in those 15 years for which a
cause could be found. Of that number, 418 were attributed to the
animals being struck by boats or barges. Seventy-eight died when
they were crushed or drowned in floodgates of locks in canals and
50 were killed by humans. Some were shot, others caught in fishing
nets or lines.
   The population was estimated at 1,000 animals in 1980, and
aerial surveys of warm-water refuges in December found 1,200
individuals.
   The manatee has been around for 60 million years, evolving from
four-footed animals about the time the dinosaurs were on their last
legs.
   Because of the deaths in 1989, the state of Florida proposed
stringent new measures to help protect them.
   The measures include establishment of manatee protection plans
in those Florida counties that had the highest rates of
boat-manatee collisions last year. They also call for creation of
new manatee protection zones, where boats may travel only at
reduced speeds to help prevent collisions, and controlling
expansion of new boating facilities in areas inhabited by manatees.
   The state also is planning stepped up enforcement of all laws to
protect the species.
   The big, slow moving animals simply can't get out of the way of
fast boats. The animals, which can reach a length in excess of 10
feet and a weight of more than 1,000 pounds, lounge in rivers and
canals feeding on plants.
   Although they do move out into salt water, they spend most of
their lives in fresh water.
   They winter in warm water areas, such as springs, and have found
new habitat in the warm-water discharges of power plants as far
north as south Georgia.
   Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge on Florida's Gulf Coast
was established as a haven for manatees. Merritt Island National
Wildlife Refuge on the Atlantic Coast also has areas closed for
manatee protection.

   Think you've heard all the fish stories?
   As this one is told, the shad, a most sensitive fish, was
terrified at storms and troubled waters, and delighted in quiet and
musical sounds. So, some wise old German fishermen hooked some wood
to their nets and hung a number of small bells on them.
   When the nets moved, the bells chimed in harmony and the fish
were lured to their destructions.
   The story comes from Terry Mayer, a designer of bell jewelry and
a bell hobbyist. She's designed a fish bell, introduced by
Cartier's in 1980, as well as a whale bell in sterling silver and a
fish whistle-bell, among others.
   In researching styles for her fish bells, she found references
to bells ringing in markets in ancient Greece to announce the
arrival of a fresh catch and ancient Indian Ocean sailors ringing
bells through the dark night to frighten away ``monster'' fish.
   She notes the connection between fish and bells in many other
nations.
   In Japan, for instance, the carp is the national emblem of
boyhood, the symbol for swimming courageously against the stream of
life. Wind-bells with brass pendant carps were formerly used in
celebrations of Children's Day thoughout the Far East and bronze
carp bells are given to boys today as a revered toy.
   In Italy, some fishermen hook a bell to the fishing pole to
alert them to a bite and in India, brass bells in teardrop shapes
are called ``fishing bells.''

   Americans seem be spending more time outdoors lately, including
entertaining outdoors.
   In a recent survey, 73 percent said their families have become
more interested in spending time outdoors at their home since 1986
and half of the respondents said they are spending more time
entertaining outdoors.
   The survey was conducted by the Better Homes and Gardens
Consumer Panel.
   As a result of the outdoors interest, says John Cashmore,
Weyerhauser LifeWood program manager, Americans are also looking
more at new products for their outdoor environments.
   He says outdoor millwork products for building decks and
high-tech, low-voltage lighting fixtures are among the products
gaining new interest.
   The new outdoor millwork products, Cashmore says, offer
consumers more variety than dimensional lumber _ decorative
spindles and railings, lattice panels, turned finials and posts
with notches and grooves for easier assembling.
   Technological advancements in low-voltage outdoor lighting also
have expanded the number of fixture styles available.
   ``We know people are doing more outdoor dining, lounging and
entertaining,'' says Tom Swain, Toro lighting marketing manager.
``So it only makes sense that the dinner parties may continue after
sunset. The night is a much friendlier place if it's tamed by
lights.''
   The Better Homes and Gardens Consumer Panel survey said 60
percent found ``lightscaping'' their deck and yard with low-voltage
lighting of interest to them.
   The survey also said 74 percent would build their outdoor
project themselves.

   The ball is back in play at the court, according to a survey
sponsored by the American Tennis Industry Federation.
   More than 20 million Americans over 12 years old played tennis
in 1988, and a steady core of enthusiasts play regularly, according
to the survey, conducted by Audits and Surveys, a public opinion
firm that projected the figures from a sample of 4,000 households.
   ``Tennis participation boomed in the 1970s, then declined,''
says Brad Patterson, the ATIF's executive director. ``We believe
the decline bottomed out in the mid-1980s and that participation
has been growing ever since.''
   Thirty-eight percent of all players say they played more in 1988
than in the year before, while 27 percent say they played less.
Fifty-seven percent said they would like to have played more and 39
percent say they plan to play more this year, compared to 13
percent who plan to play less.
   ``These positive attitudes are one indication that the sport is
in good health,'' says Patterson.
   The sampling indicates that most people who play tennis do so
because they think it's good exercise (61 percent). Competition was
important to 32 percent, followed by fun (22 percent) and the
social aspect (14 percent).
   Only 23 percent participated in organized match play, and 30
percent of the players say they keep score less than half the time.
   ATIF represents 112 manufacturers, distributors and importers of
tennis products.

   American quarter horses are status symbols overseas, and exports
in 1989 rose 22.3 percent over the previous year, reports the
American Quarter Horse Association. The first three months of l990
show an additional 7 percent increase, the association says.
   ``They (foreigners) come to America to buy because we know how
to breed. Although they have good breeding stock, they don't
utilize it because they don't know how,'' says Carol Rose, owner of
the American Quarter Horse Ranch in Gainesville, Texas. ``The
American qaurter horse is more versatile compared to other breeds.
They are easier to ride and have a much calmer temper. They are a
pleasure horse.''
   The Germans and Japanese are among the best customers for the
horses, according to the association. Bob Crosthwaite, president of
a Seattle horse-exporting company, regularly sends quarter horses
for use in El Rancho Grande, Japan's first dude ranch, which opened
in 1975. ``It's a fad over there,'' he says. ``They are into the
Western way of life. People want to get on a horse who have never
even seen a horse.''
   Exporting is time-consuming and expensive. Quarantines of about
two weeks, with tests and vaccinations, are monitored by the U. S.
Department of Agriculture, says David Harpman, a veterinarian who
specializes in exporting horses from Houston for several Texas
breeders. During that period, a travel agent arranges the flight
and shipping stall. Once the horse arrives in its destination
country it is usually quarantined again, with the owner responsible
for the cost.
   ``Each country has different regulations for which the owner
must be responsible,'' Harpman says. ``This can be a costly fee for
the buyer. The shipping alone can cost as much as $3,000.''

   If you dine out under the sky during the
summer, take extra precautions to avoid food poisoning.
   ``Between 20 and 80 million people, or up to a third of the
population, suffer from food poisoning each year,'' says Kay
Stanfill, assistant professor of clinical dietetics at the
University of Oklahoma Health Services Center. She rates the
hazards of bacterial contamination a far greater threat to food
than pesticides.
   Picnickers should be wary of undercooked or raw meat, poultry,
eggs or fish _ prime areas for the growth of salmonella, she points
out. Raw eggs that are cracked should never be used, and meats such
a poultry and fish should always be thoroughly cooked. Chicken on
the rotisserie is done when you cut into it and ``there are no pink
juices running from the drumstick, which is the part that cooks the
slowest,'' Stanfill says. ``Pork also should be well done and not
have any pink juices running from it.'' Beef can be cooked rare,
but she advises eating it soon after.
   Food poisoning victims can suffer diarrhea, fever and vomiting
lasting two to seven days, beginning any time from 12 to 36 hours
after they eat contaminated food, Stanfill says. ``It might be so
mild that they wouldn't even know they had it, but it can escalate
up to being fatal.''
   She cites the United States Department of Agriculture's ``Seven
Commandments of Food Safety'':
   _ Wash hands before handlng food.
   _ Keep it safe _ refrigerate.
   _ Don't thaw frozen food on the kitchen counter. Use the
refrigerator.
   _ Wash hands, utensils and surfaces again after contact with raw
meat and poultry.
   _ Never leaver perishable food out longer than two hours.
   _ Thoroughly cook raw meat, poultry and fish.
   _ Freeze or refrigerate leftovers promptly.
   Stanfill adds that you should be sure you are cooking food long
enough in the microwave and not serving undercooked food that may
look done but isn't.

   The Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission, which
oversees a park system used by 21 million people a year, offers
some suggestions to make your picnic more friendly to the
environment.
   _ Use biodegradable paper plates _ not plastic. Even better,
take washable plates, cups and silverware which you re-use.
   _ Pack sandwiches in biodegradable waxed paper, or re-usable
containers you take with you.
   _ If you bring soap, make sure it is low-phosphate and
biodegradable.
   _ Pack a paper sack for your trash and put it all in the garbage
can.
   _ Take empty aluminum cans back home and sell them to a
recycling center.
   _ Use cloth napkins and table covers instead of paper throwaways.
   _ Use cleaning cloths instead of paper towels.
   _ Be especially careful with six-pack rings that hold beer of
soda cans together _ they can be a real disaster for birds and
marine life. They are practically invisible in the water and birds
and fish get caught in them and die.
   If you use them, cut the rings before you throw them in the
trash. If you see any six-pack rings somebody has used to trash the
environment, pick them up and put them in a garbage can.

   Nearly 32 million sets of footprints were laid
down on the 3,100 miles of abandoned railroad corridors converted
to trails, the Rails to Trails Conservancy says.
   ``If these miles of trails were connected, they would stretch
all the way from Boston to Los Angeles,'' says Peter Harnik, RTC's
director of programs.
   There are 242 rail-trails in 34 states. An additional 200 to 300
corridors are in some stage of being converted from railroad to

   The federal government provided the states
with $297 million this year to help finance fish and wildlife
restoration programs.
   The money came from federal excise taxes on firearms,
ammunition, fishing tackle; import duties on fishing tackle and
pleasure boats and some of the motorboat fuel tax.
   Distribution of sport fish restoration funds is based on a
formula which considers the number of license holders and a state's
size and population.
   The largest chunk of wildlife restoration and hunter education
money, $5.45 million, went to Texas. California, Michigan and
Pennsylvania each got more than $4 million.
   The smallest amounts, $689,500, went to Delaware, Rhode Island,
New Hampshire, Hawaii and Vermont, among the states.
   Alaska, California and Texas got the largest amount of fisheries
money, $8.99 million, followed by Michigan, $7.2 million,
Minnesota, $6.5 million and Wisconsin $6.1 million. Every state got
at least $1.78 million.

   You don't have to see an animal to know there's
been one in the area.
   There are five basic types of signs most animals leave behind
and a sharp-eyed observer can find them and learn from the clues
they provide.
   The first is tracks. In sand or mud, any animal will portray its
presence.
   The second is scats, or droppings. Not only can they be
identified by species, and sometimes by male or female of the
species, but scientists analyze them to tell what foods the animals
ar using.
   Plant-eating animals leave their marks. Whitetail deer, which
have no upper incisor teeth, leave a ragged edge on the stems of
plants they break off. The head of a catfish lying on the bank
often means an otter recently dined. Rotted logs that have been
torn up often are the remains of a restaurant where skunks or foxes
dug out grubs.
   Construction signs are among the most obvious. Beavers build
dams. Most birds and squirrels build nests. Many animals excavate
dens.
   Animals often leave bits of themselves behind. That includes a
bird's feather, a snake's skin or the antlers of deer, elk or
moose. Animals hairs caught on branches or around holes in trees
tell of the animals using them.
   An experienced sign reader can be your guide. There are several
good field guides available to help the beginner interpret what he
sees during a walk in the woods.

   Those rugged mountain bikes can take you places you can't get on
foot or by car, but some expertise is needed to get the best out of
them.
   Mount Snow in Vermont offers weekend instruction for these
doughty two-wheelers throughout the summer. If you're a beginner,
you will learn shifting, balance, weight transfer and body
position. If you're experienced, you will move on to log jumping,
stream crossing and technical maneuvers. Clinics on bike
maintenance, repair and map reading also are included. Classes take
place on the 140-mile trail network in the Green Mountain National
Forest, and participants can use the trail system for add-on days
after the classes. Bikers can bring their own machines or rent from
the school.

   Outdoor summer fun for many is following the bouncing ball. But
this is no ordinary ball; it's a balloon in a sack.
   The balloon ball, called Balzac, is created by blowing up a
regular balloon inside a washable cotton sack. It can be folded up
and stuffed into a pocket, packed in a knapsack or thrown in a
saddle bag. After a day of play, the balloon can be popped and the
cotton sack thrown into the washing machine.

<HEAD>Heart Resuscitation in Nursing Homes Works Only Rarely, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nursing home residents whose hearts have stopped
are so rarely helped by cardiopulmonary resuscitation that perhaps
homes should not even offer to try it, researchers suggest.
   Failing that policy change, residents who want to avoid
resuscitation should get their doctors to record that wish in their
medical records and should legally appoint somebody to speak for
them, said researcher Dr. Thomas Finucane.
   Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, called CPR, involves forceful
thrusts to the chest and blowing air into the mouth.
   That amounts to a ``meaningless assault'' when performed on
nursing home residents who have only a tiny chance of benefit,
researchers said. And it imposes costs, such as the nursing time
taken from other areas of patient care, they said.
   Moreover, the community of residents may be disrupted by ``this
generally futile, violent event, often inflicted on a frail and
failing neighbor.''
   Finucane practices geriatric medicine at the Francis Scott Key
Medical Center in Baltimore and is on the faculty of the Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine. He and his colleagues discuss the issue
in the March issue of the Journal of the American Geriatrics
Society.
   They checked hospital and ambulance records for nursing home
residents older than 65 who underwent CPR and then were taken to a
hospital.
   Results showed that 102 of 117 were pronounced dead in the
emergency room and 13 others died later in the hospital. Only two
survived hospitalization, one of whom died two weeks after release,
and the other eight months after.
   ``We conclude that the benefits of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
initiated in nursing homes are extremely limited,'' the researchers
wrote.
   Even if a patient is resuscitated, he is likely to be in pain
from broken ribs and may suffer brain injury from the period his
brain lacked oxygen, Finucane said in a telephone interview.
   Currently, nursing homes generally require that CPR be attempted
on all residents unless a specific order to the contrary is
written, researchers said.
   In principle, Finucane said, a do-not-resuscitate order can be
written after the doctor discusses CPR with his patient, if the
resident can participate, and the family.
   ``What actually happens is, in many, many cases, no one ever
talks to the family about it. And when you do talk to the family
about it, many times the family is extremely conflicted,'' Finucane
said.
   ``The family feels terrible because they're putting their
relative in a nursing home,'' and now the doctor is essentially
asking about letting the relative die. ``They feel this intensifies
the abandonment in some way. So one common thing is that families
make very unrealistic requests to resuscitate patients.''
   As for a request for CPR by the nursing home resident himself,
Finucane compared it to a patient asking for repeated futile cancer
surgeries or for all the blood in a blood bank, even if the blood
type does not match.
   A better approach might be not to do CPR unless the patient or
family signs a form asking for it, he said. Yet, some family
members may do so unrealistically, ``and then there will be
unprotected older people who will undergo meaningless violence,''
he said.
   So he said he ``reluctantly'' favors simply not offering CPR,
even though that removes the option of informed consent to the
procedure, and the chance of reviving the few people who would
benefit.
   ``It's a tradeoff,'' he said. ``It is a flawed proposal, but I
believe it is the best on the menu right now.''
   Ethicist Bart Collopy of The Third Age Gerontology Center at
Fordham University in New York, said the new work raises ``a
crucial question. Just from a medical viewpoint, the notion of
routinely pursuing futile treatment is quite dubious.''
   Collopy said he would prefer that CPR be included as part of a
discussion of an overall care plan with the resident and family.
Failing that, he suggested that decisions on CPR be made
individually. Denying CPR to older people as a group might
encourage similar blanket denials of other treatments, he said.
   The key question he said, is whether CPR would give nursing home
residents a benefit ``by their definition, not our definition.''

   The loudest round of applause came when
an advocate complained that buses for homebound seniors arrived
hours early or late and sometimes dropped people at doctor's
offices and supermarkets but never returned for them.
   For people robbed of their mobility, Julie Shaw told the state's
Pepper Commission on Aging, the bus was a lifeline but an
unreliable one.
   Members of the state commission wanted to know who was
responsible for the bus service and promised to follow up on the
complaint. One of the commission's duties is to act as a watchdog
for seniors.
   The fledgling commission, which hired its staff at the first of
the year, is one of two bearing the name of the late U.S. Rep.
Claude Pepper, Mr. Senior Citizen.
   Since his death last May 30, the two commissions, the Mildred
and Claude Pepper Foundation, and his allies have guaranteed his
legacy will spread beyond his work over a 43-year political career.
   A congressional report in March by the Bipartisan Commission on
Comprehensive Health Care, commonly known as the Pepper Commission,
called for a $66 billion-a-year plan for mandatory health insurance
for all Americans and long-term medical care.
   The Pepper Foundation, created by the congressman three years
before his death, has received a $10 million grant from Congress to
fund philanthropic works.
   Beneficiaries include Florida State University, which will be
the home of the elder statesman's official papers and a Pepper
Institute on Aging at the Tallahassee campus.
   ``I'm not sure if anybody can replace Claude Pepper,'' said Cal
Broughton, a legislative representative with the American
Association for Retired Persons in Washington. ``They don't replace
somebody like that. There will be a number of people that will take
up a number of issues and a number of causes.''
   People across the country knew that a complaint to Pepper got
action, and the wily politician could be a gadfly or turn on his
Southern charm to get what he wanted.
   His Washington office became a central processing station for
complaints by senior citizens about federal services and by the
disadvantaged about just about anything.
   In Congress, Pepper's legendary oratory played a pivotal role in
the repeal of mandatory retirement and helped protect Social
Security from cuts.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, is still producing reports requested by Pepper, said
Kathy Gardner, a former aide to Pepper as a staff member on the
House Select Committee on Aging.
   His legislation to create the National Institute on Deafness,
the 13th unit in the National Institutes of Health, passed just
before his death, and regulations setting minimum training
standards for nurse's aides at nursing homes were published in
March under a Pepper bill.
   Although Pepper's name was widely associated with the ill-fated
catastrophic health care bill, he opposed its financing method. In
his final illness, he had a wry smile over the stirrings of public
dissent, which would lead to repeal, Gardner said.
   Other politicians have absorbed Pepper packages or platforms on
comprehensive national health insurance, nursing home care, home
health care and youth programs, she said.
   Across the nation, Pepper's name has been given to the National
Institutes of Health administration building, a Center on Aging at
the University of Michigan and an award from the Mount Sinai
Hospital geriatrics department in New York.
   ``Almost daily I hear of some new program, building, award et
cetera that has been named after him,'' said Frances Campbell, a
longtime legislative aide who chairs the Pepper Foundation.
   In Florida, where Pepper began his political career as a
28-year-old state legislator, elderly issues are a priority in a
state long viewed as the nation's retirement mecca.
   The state Pepper Commission set two priorities for the spring
legislative session: boost state aid for the poor living in group
homes who don't require nursing home care and reinstate senior
education programs cut three years ago.
   ``Nationwide, roughly 12 percent of the population is over 65,''
said Edward Annis, a state commissioner and retired chief of
surgery at Miami's Mercy Hospital. ``In Florida, we're approaching
19 percent. Among those are many affluent citizens who come down
here and merely change their residence from other states. But among
those are great numbers of people who have a rough time getting
along.''
   At a recent hearing in Lauderhill, commissioners were told of
state legislation to require doctors to accept Medicare patients,
the hidden rate of elderly suicides, the need for adult day-care
for Alzheimer's patients, the danger of hypothermia, and cuts in
services to the blind elderly.
   With the Pepper name in the commission title as a daily reminder
of his political passions, commission Executive Director June Noel
said, ``I think we have to remember what he stood for while we go
about our business.''
   ``He will have a lasting legacy,'' said John Rother, legislative
director of AARP. ``As long as people refer to him and appeal to
his memory in attempting to build support, that's an indication
that there's a real legacy.''

<HEAD>No New Slots Available for Elderly in Federal Nutrition Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly participants in a federal nutrition
program for the needy won't be shoved out, but others hoping to
join may have to find food elsewhere, a federal official says.
   Cost overruns and food shortages prompted the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in January to ask that states drop some elderly people
from the program to make room for poor women, infants and children.
   But that drew some opposition, particularly from Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., whose office argued that the agency was
creating competition between groups of poor people.
   The federal bureaucracy ``caused a problem where these two
groups were pitted against each other,'' said Tim Gearan, a
DeConcini aide who specializes in nutrition appropriations.
   The 11-year-old program, called FOOD Plus, operates in 18 states
and the District of Columbia. The 278,000 participants, more than a
third of them elderly, are provided food from federal surplus
commodities.
   USDA had said in a January directive that programs would have to
be trimmed to September 1989 levels and that elderly participants
might have to be replaced with needy infants, children and women
who were either pregnant or had small children.
   ``We're not bumping any people off the program right now, but
we're not accepting any new ones,'' said Phil Shanholtzer, a
spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   Gearan and Shanholtzer agreed that the problem lies, at least in
part, with the way USDA acquires food.
   Another problem, Shanholtzer said, was that most states had
exceeded their authorized case loads, which ``hadn't been a real
big deal'' as long as there was plenty of money.
   However, he added, shortages of dairy products, which must be
included in the food packages, forced the USDA to buy non-fat dry
milk and canned milk on the open market.
   ``Surpluses were not as readily available as in past years,''
Shanholtzer said, adding that milk purchases ``sucked up quite a
bit of money.''
   Gearan said the USDA shouldn't have anticipated a dairy surplus.
   Shanholtzer said the USDA has enough money to continue the
program for the remainder of the year. But Gearan said FOOD Plus
generally needs to be better funded and better operated.
   ``We really think we can do a better job,'' he added. ``These
people are really destitute. They're selling their furniture. They
can't skimp on their utility bills, but they will skimp on their
food bills.''

<HEAD>Study Says Single Elderly Prefer Living Alone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Single elderly people prefer living alone to
sharing homes with family members, a study shows.
   ``Most elderly persons have chosen to live in their own
households, with a spouse while he or she is alive, and alone when
they become widowed,'' two researchers reported in the May issue of
the Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences. The journal is
published by the Washington-based Gerontological Society of
America, an association of researchers in aging.
   Jacqueline Lowe Worobey of Rutgers University in New Jersy and
Ronald Angel of the University of Texas at Austin studied 2,498
unmarried elderly people. The study group consisted primarily of
non-Hispanic white female widows. More than half of those studied
were at least 80 years old, and 40 percent had annual incomes less
than $7,000.
   Worobey and Angel asked participants whether they preferred
living alone, moving into another person's home or having someone
move into theirs, or entering a nursing home.
   ``Although the formation of an extended household is an obvious
mechanism by which people might pool their resources in order to
increase their aggregate well-being, this option is not readily
adopted,'' the researchers said. ``The strains associated with
living (with family members) appear to outweigh any advantage that
may result from pooled resources.''
   The study did not provide exact figures as to the percentage of
respondents in each group.

<HEAD>Getting the Fat Out and Keeping the Flavor In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE WESTON WILSON</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``I've got to find a better way of getting John
to cut back on fat and cholesterol than shrinking the size of his
hamburger. He was furious.''
   My friend Letitia's lament is due to the fact that many of us
are faced with changing a lifelong habit. Meat was not only eaten
every day, but often in two or three meals a day: bacon at
breakfast; lunch meat or leftovers from the roast for sandwiches;
and the focal point of dinner. And although many of us are willing
to cut back, not everyone wants to give up meat completely.
   The fat is where the flavor is, no doubt about that, whether
it's the skin of chicken or turkey, or the layer of fat around a
chop or steak. So if we're going to give up that fat, what have we
got to replace it?
   To the rescue come cooking techniques that have become very
popular. Year-round grilling (which can be done in a fireplace in
winter), rotisseries, oven broiling, quick sauteeing. With these go
marinades that impart wonderful exotic flavors to meat. This is not
a new way of cooking. It's embracing many cultures.
   We have the great and favorite peasant dishes, couscous,
cassoulet, curry feijoada, picadillo. All these are served with or
without meat. So couscous can be made with lamb or chicken or
vegetables. So can curry and cassoulet.
   Let's look at Chinese food. The balance is often one-third meat
to two-thirds vegetables, yet the food is beautiful and delicious.
   We also don't have to give up our favorite foods. I'm happy to
fry chicken for a picnic, but I find when I remove the skin and dip
the chicken in a beaten egg and equal amounts of shredded parmesan
cheese and breadcrumbs, and bake it at high temperatures, it's
crunchy. Or rub skinned turkey legs with a little oil and oregano
and crushed red peppers, bake at high heat and it's crispy.
   You can also skewer beef, lamb, chicken or fish shish
kebab-style with vegetables and broil only four to eight minutes
for a delicious entree. You marinate first with herbs and oil and
sometimes wine or vermouth for a rich flavor.
   And old-fashioned meat loaf? Why not? Bake one up, cut into
portions, ziplock and freeze extra servings. Or buy a pound of
ground meat, season with mustard and egg and milk and fresh dill,
and roll into 24 meatballs. Four or five make a serving that is
bountiful and fun to eat.
   Breaking the habit doesn't have to be so hard after all.

<HEAD>Once Settled, Rhubarb Can Take Care of Itself</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In slang, a rhubarb is a noisy
argument, but in the garden rhubarb behaves like a model citizen.
With scarcely any help from me, this attractive vegetable thrives
quietly in a corner, its rosy stalks coming up year after year for
my favorite pies.
   How did such an easygoing plant lend its name to quarrels and
fights? Well, it seems theater people discovered that muttering
``rhubarb'' over and over creates the sound effect of anger in
crowd scenes. Red Barber, a famed baseball broadcaster, widely used
the term for hassles on the diamond. And a comic author of the
1940s, H. Allen Smith, wrote a novel ``Rhubarb,'' featuring a
pugnacious cat with that name.
   Actually, the taste of rhubarb has an extra-tartness that
inspired poets long ago to use the word to convey emotional
bitterness. In pies and sauces, you need plenty of sweetener to
bring out the vegetable's best qualities. Moreover, the plant has a
dangerously split personality: Only the stalks are edible; the big
green leaves are poisonous and must be trimmed off after harvest.
   Rhubarb and asparagus generally are the only perennials grown in
the vegetable garden and usually occupy end spaces, leaving middle
areas for annuals like tomatoes, corn and beans. As a perennial,
rhubarb is ideal for an elderly gardener seeking lighter chores.
You plant it once; after that, it just about takes care of itself.
   Cold-hardy, rhubarb needs winter dormancy and is not usually
grown in areas where winters are too mild. You can raise rhubarb
from seed, but most people save a year by putting in roots
obtainable from seed houses and nurseries or from a neighbor happy
to give away root divisions. I've found that one well-established
plant _ cut back from three I planted 20 years ago _ easily takes
care of pies for me and my wife nowadays, with some stalks left
over to give away.
   Prepare the soil well before planting, mixing in rotted manure
or compost. For three plants, you'll need a bed about 3 feet wide
by 10 feet long. The plants eventually get large, so space them
about 3 feet apart. You put in the roots, known as ``corms,'' 3 or
4 inches deep, leaving the tops about 2 inches below the surface.
Don't touch first-year growth _ the plant needs time to establish
itself _ but start harvesting the second year. To avoid rot, don't
cut the stalks with a knife, but grasp them at the bottom and
twist, breaking them off beneath ground level.
   I keep out weeds by mulching with leaves, which also enrich the
soil as they decompose. If you don't have leaves, salt hay,
obtainable from nurseries, will do as well. In all these years,
I've never had to use chemical fertilizer for the rhubarb, nor have
I had any problems with diseases or insects.
   While it needs sun, rhubarb will tolerate some shade. One
recommended practice I've followed is to remove flower stalks,
which tend to weaken production, as soon as they appear. The pale
green pompon size flowers are easily recognizable.
   In my garden, 50 miles north of Manhattan, rhubarb comes up in
March and its stalks are long enough for pulling by mid-May. My
plant produces stalks a foot or more long, reddish at the lower end
and greener at the top. Five or six of these are plenty for a pie.
Some varieties may produce much longer and larger stalks. I've read
of stalks weighing 2 pounds, 11{ ounces being exhibited at the
Massachusetts Horticultural Society a century ago.
   Rhubarb was known from antiquity as a medicinal plant, the root
being used as a laxative. Now, as a vegetable, it's ranked high in
fiber and contains vitamins A and C and some B vitamins and
minerals. Native to southeastern Russia, it was reputedly first
brought to America from England by Benjamin Franklin in 1770 and
was being offered in seed catalogs by the early 19th century. Aside
from its popularity in pies, which gave it the name ``pie plant,''
rhubarb has found its way onto gourmet menus in a sauce, say for
duck or fish.
   Botanically a vegetable, rhubarb was classified as a fruit by
the U.S. Customs Service in 1947, import duty being lower on fruits
than on vegetables. The plant's name just seems to inpspire
imaginative use. World War II aviators, for example, called
low-altitude strafing runs ``rhubarbs'' because they could see the
big-leaf plants in the gardens.

<HEAD>Bush Criticized for Failure to Call Aging Conference</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of one of the nation's leading
advocacy groups for older people has denounced the Bush
administration's failure to call a White House Conference on Aging
for 1991.
   Daniel Thursz, president of the National Council on the Aging,
said Bush should ``request money, set a date, and start a planning
process in the immediate future'' for a conference next year.
   The conferences have been held every 10 years since 1961 and
draw thousands of delegates from around the nation. Bush has yet to
announce whether he'll call a 1991 conference, which Congress
authorized _ but didn't require _ in 1987 legislation.
   Conferences in 1961 and 1971 helped launch programs from
Medicare to Meals-on-Wheels. Though marred by politics, the 1981
gathering help fend off Social Security cuts.

<HEAD>Study Finds Satisfaction in Second Careers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Older professionals who move on to second jobs
that pay less money and offer fewer benefits may find more
satisfaction than they did in previous positions, a study shows.
   A survey of 24 workers who joined a self-help group for
unemployed professionals found that the 16 who found jobs within a
year were more satisfied with supervisors, nature of work and
likelihood for advancement than they were in previous careers, even
though they were less satisfied with salaries.
   Results of the study were published in the April issue of the
Journal of Counseling, published by the American Psychological
Association.
   The author, University of Oregon psychologist Brent
Mallinckrodt, examined how professionals over 40 rated new jobs for
pay, benefits, satisfaction with co-workers and supervisors, the
nature of the work and prospects for advancement.
   ``It was believed that increased age would predict decreased job
satisfaction and instead the reverse happened,'' Mallinckrodt said.

<HEAD>Women's Sexual Interest Doesn't Necessarily Decline with Age</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Older women can maintain continued interest
in sex if they have a sexually active partner and are free of
disease and mental illness, researchers report.
   ``Although sexual activity in general declines with age, the
proportion of elderly women who retain sexual desire and are
sexually active is remarkable,'' Drs. Arshang D. Mooradian and
Vicki Greiff wrote in the May issue of Archives of Internal
Medicine.
   Anxiety and depression are more common in the elderly than in
younger people, and such mental disturbances can spur a loss of
sexual desire, the University of Arizona researchers said.
   They said older women with estrogen deficiency also experience
changes related to sexual function, such as reduced vaginal blood
flow. But the deficiency can be easily treated, they added.
   For women who are healthy, sexual activity and interest in sex
doesn't necessarily decline with age, Mooradian and Greiff said.

   The American Association of Retired Persons
named the late Philadelphia activist Max Weiner the winner of its
first Consumer Action Award.
   Weiner spearheaded many consumer victories since establishing
the Consumer Education and Protective Association in 1966. He
developed a three-step grievance procedure (investigate, negotiate,
demonstrate) that has become a model for advocacy groups across the
country, AARP said.
   His successes included defeating hikes in utility and telephone
rates, public transportation fares and city taxes, AARP said.
Weiner was campaigning to be Philadelphia city controller when he
died in October 1989.
   ``Max Weiner was the consummate consumer advocate,'' Horace B.
Deets, AARP executive director, said. ``His innovative strategies
and boundless energy set a standard for the nation and countless
others have benefited from his work.''
   The award was presented April 27 to Weiner's widow, Bessie, at a
ceremony in Washington. It was established to recognize an older
person who has generated significant change in a company or
government agency to benefit consumers.

   Share prices surged on the Tokyo stock market
today, while the dollar fell against the Japanese yen for the
fourth consecutive trading day.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 530.51 points, or 1.68
percent, closing at 32,042.65 points. The Tokyo market's main
barometer rose 531.88 points Friday.
   After jumping 459.13 points in the morning session, the Nikkei
added only 71.38 more points in the afternoon. A total of 800
million shares traded hands during the day.
   Satoru Nagayoshi, a trader with New Japan Securities Co., said
the market failed to react to the only major movement in the
afternoon: a large-scale purchase by U.S. securities trader Salomon
Brothers.
   An analyst with Nomura Securities attributed the recent rise in
stock prices to the decline in interest rates abroad, the rise in
domestic bond prices and the rapid fall of the dollar.
   On the exchange market, the dollar closed at 153.35 yen, down
0.80 yen from its finish Friday of 154.15 yen. After opening at
152.45, it fluctuated between 152.45 yen and 153.90 yen. The dollar
now has fallen a total of 4.70 yen in the last four trading days.
   Dealers said the dollar's low opening followed its slump in New
York Friday, due partly to U.S. government reports indicating
inflationary pressures had been curbed. Inflation tends to push up
interest rates, making the dollar more attractive to investors.
   A U.S. Labor Department report released Friday showed an
unexpected 0.3 percent decline in April U.S. wholesale prices,
coupled with a 0.6 percent decline in retail sales during the month.
   Buy orders for the dollar appeared in today's trading, but the
upswing did not affect the dollar's overall downward trend, said
Masato Nakamura, a currency dealer for Sumitomo Bank.
   Other dealers interpreted the dollar's recent decline as part of
a long-term adjustment to its rise since the beginning of this year.
   The price of the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds
rose to 87.69 points by 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EDT) today, up from its
Friday close of 87.40 percent. Their yield dropped to 7.020 percent
from 7.080 percent.

   Even with President Bush's assurance that
``everything is on the table,'' it's hard to imagine a major
deficit-reduction agreement emerging from the politically jumpy
group he and the Democrats have assembled.
   But that's why this year's budget summit could be a surprise
success.
   In past times with an atmosphere more conducive to agreement,
budget compromises have proven tough.
   President Reagan convened an emergency summit in 1987 when the
crisis on Wall Street scared Republicans and Democrats alike,
making conditions excellent for a Big Deal to put the nation's
fiscal policy on track toward a balanced budget.
   The negotiators were a serious and mostly agreeable group.
Reagan sent his chief of staff, former Sen. Howard Baker, to lead
his representatives. House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., anchored the Democratic group from Congress.
   But almost a month of closed-door sessions yielded a plan that
only kept things from getting worse. Today, it looks like the
federal deficit will run about as high this year as it did then,
and the atmosphere for agreement appears worse.
   Going into this year's talks, there is no clear crisis to spur
action, though the administration warns that next year's deficit
could run up to $100 billion over the $64 billion deficit limit.
   No one will use the adjective ``congenial'' for this year's
negotiation group. The fact that it's an election year only makes
matters worse.
   Baker, Foley and other key players in the 1987 talks are gone.
Baker returned to the private sector, while Foley is now speaker of
the House. He, like Bush, will watch the negotiations from a
distance.
   The president's top man this time will be Chief of Staff John
Sununu, a strong-willed conservative who already has flirted with
sinking the whole effort.
   At the same time the president was reassuring Democrats he would
go into the talks open-minded, Sununu was saying the opposite was
really true _ that Bush would kill any tax increase the Democrats
proposed.
   One top Democratic aide said Sununu was making Bush's call for a
summit look like ``an invitation to a beheading.''
   Besides those attending because of committee or executive branch
positions, the other Republicans in the talks specialize in
attacking Democrats on the tax issue. House Minority Whip Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., is outspoken on almost anything that could defeat
Democrats, and Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is about as anti-tax as
anyone in the Senate.
   On the Democratic side, Foley appointed Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., as chairman of the talks.
   Gephardt, who sought his party's presidential nomination in
1988, is one of Bush's most persistent critics and the leading
opponent of the president's plan to cut capital gains tax rates.
Bush has complained that Gephardt's attacks are too personal, and
Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, compared Gephardt to
television's Maxwell Smart.
   House Majority Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., and Sen. Wyche
Fowler, D-Ga., also joining the Democratic squad, are seasoned
political sharpshooters. Fowler once compared Gingrich to an organ
grinder's monkey.
   But there may be a silver lining in this storm cloud.
   In 1987, negotiators on both sides seemed hampered by doubt.
They were always breaking up to check back with their principals _
Reagan, Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd or House Speaker Jim
Wright. Inevitably, delicate discussions would screech to a halt
when details of pending proposals were leaked.
   This time, checking back with the big guys will be a formality.
If this bunch can agree on something, they'll know that the people
outside can buy into it.
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., a veteran of previous budget talks
and a participant in this year's sessions, says that in 1987 it
took 10 or 12 days before the group got over its mutual suspicions
and down to business. He expects the same thing will happen this
time.
   When a deal is struck the best thing to do is seal it quickly,
he said. Perhaps armored cars could take the negotiators to the
White House for a signing ceremony before people begin to pick away
at it, he joked.
   Once the agreement is in place, he predicted, ``you'll hustle up
a majority vote.''

   Prices surged higher on London's Stock Exchange
Monday, riding a bullish wave that started in New York on Friday.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was up 32.3 points or 1.5 percent, at 2,208.2, its highest point of
the day. The index last closed above 2,200 on April 18, finishing
that day at 2,205.9.
   Slightly disappointing economic indicators for April failed to
dampen the market's spirit as a squeeze on available stock helping
buoy share prices, dealers said.
   The British government reported a 1.0 percent rise in April
retail sales from March, and a 2.4 percent gain from April 1989,
surpassing market expectations of a 0.3 percent rise in April from
March.
   The April provisional producer price index showed output prices
rising 1.0 percent in April from March and input prices falling 0.3
percent in April from March against expectations of output up 0.6
percent and input down 0.1 percent.
   One dealer said the figures should have caused the market to
ease but were ignored because the market was doing so well.
   The U.K. market's surge followed a strong rise on Wall Street,
where the Dow Jones industrial average soared 63.07 points Friday
to 2,801.58, and an overnight gain in Tokyo, where the Nikkei
225-stock index jumped 530.51 to 32,042.65.
   Among individual stocks, the food and clothing retailer Marks &amp;
Spencer rose 5 pence, or 8.4 cents, a share to 203 pence after
reporting its yearend pretax profit was up 14 percent.
   Enterprise and Lasmo, the oil companies, rose after Kuwait
officially announced it is to cut back on operating spot contracts,
leaving more room for the British concerns. Enterprise rose 16
pence to 616 pence a share, while Lasmo rose 18 pence to 401 pence.
   Bass, the brewery, pub and leisure group rose 24 pence to 10
pounds a share on rumors it had sold its Crest Hotel chain to
Trusthouse Forte, the hotels and catering group. The rumors were
not confirmed by the company.

   In these days of growing environmental concern
and overflowing landfills, the comeback of a packing material
called excelsior _ long, thin strands of wood nearly forgotten in
the age of plastic _ is only natural.
   ``After the Earth Day celebration, it was phenomenal the
interest,'' said Jim LeFevre, assistant branch manager for American
Excelsior Co. of Arlington, Texas. ``Our customers are telling us
their customers are asking for environmentally safe packaging.''
   Despite the pervasive spread in recent decades of plastic foam
peanuts and plastic bubble pack, companies like LeFevre's never
stopped making excelsior. For the last four decades it was used
mainly to cover budding foliage and prevent erosion.
   Now, it has received a facelift of sorts to make it more
palatable to companies packaging everything from cosmetics to
delicate dishes.
   In red, green, blue, orange, purple and every shade between,
excelsior made one of the more colorful displays at last week's
Eastern Packaging Exposition at New York's Javits Convention Center.
   It wasn't the only packing product on view that sought to play
on the burgeoning sensitivity to environmental concerns.
   ``There's no question about it. I think most major corporations
are going to have a real thrust into using more environmentally
safe materials,'' said Philip Thorn, a purchasing manager of
Johnson &amp; Johnson Orthopedics in Braintree, Mass.
   ``Our selling point now is biodegradable and non-toxic. Even our
glue is non-toxic,'' Kevin Arnold told customers as he described
cardboard-like packaging materials made by Honeycomb Corp. of North
Haven, Conn.
   New laws are forcing some companies to buy biodegradable
packaging, said Robert Sadlik, supervisor of Miles Pharmaceutical.
   Besides, he says, ``Peanuts are getting to be a problem. You
open a box and they blow all over the place. Somebody's got to come
up with something to replace peanuts.''
   Brian Stewartson, sales manager for Ranpak Corp. of Willoughby,
Ohio, claims his company already has. The product, ``Padpack,''
consists of thick paper that has been crumbled.
   ``It's back to the basics. There's no pizzazz,'' Stewartson said.
   Padpack sales in the Northeast for the first three months of
this year were 300 percent above the same period last year.
   ``There's definitely something going on,'' he said.
   One product on display was ``Lock 'n' Pop,'' a Key Tech Corp.
item that salespeople said could be used instead of plastic wrap to
seal boxes and attach them to one another.
   ``Lock 'n' Pop'' is a clear, non-toxic, and often invisible
adhesive, the Ocean, N.J. company boasts in its literature. And it
claims to have signed up Coca-Cola, Nabisco, Du Pont, Honeywell,
Revlon, Cargill and Ralston Purina.
   Fred Biesecker, president and chairman of the board of Drug
Plastics and Glass Co. Inc. of Boyertown, Pa., conceded that his
own company's invention _ a plastic container that uses one-third
recycled plastic _ is not the least expensive way to make a bottle.
   But, he says, ``a better life is not a cheaper life.''
   He said he had not thought about recycling plastic before
attending a waste seminar in New York two years ago. He smiled as
he noted, ``Today I'm introducing a bottle that's got garbage in
it.''

   Stock prices kept climbing today, extending the
rally that carried the market to near-record levels at the end of
last week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.13 to 2,806.71 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers took a 2-1 lead over losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 715 up, 354 down and 530

   Volume on the Big Board came to 32.09 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Last week's upsurge moved the market into position to challenge
the Dow's record closing high of 2,810.15 reached on Jan. 2.
   The rally has been attributed to a sudden favorable swing in
economic statistics of late, which has reduced worries over
inflation and the interest-rate outlook.
   Open-market interest rates were steady to slightly lower today
after dropping sharply on Friday. Yields on long-term government
bonds, which topped 9 percent a couple of weeks ago, stood in the
8.63 percent-8.67 percent range.

   The number of working U.S. oil and natural gas
rigs rose for the second straight week, increasing by 11 to total
941, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The rig count the previous week climbed a modest three after
posting declines for several weeks. A year ago, the rig count was
771, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count is the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity. It reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Wyoming posted the largest
gain with five, followed by New Mexico, four; and Texas, three.
Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania each increased by two, while
Colorado added one.
   Louisiana had the largest decline with five followed by
Oklahoma, four; Kansas, three; and California, one. North Dakota
was unchanged from last week.

   N.V. Philips announced today the
resignation of its president in a ``crisis of confidence'' after
the multinational electronics company barely broke even in the
first quarter.
   Cor van der Klugt, 65, will retire on July 1 and be succeeded by
his deputy, Jan Timmer, former Philips president Wisse Dekker said
at a news conference today.
   Dekker's announcement followed days of speculation over Van der
Klugt's future, set off by Philips' May 3 announcement that it had
earned a mere 6 million guilders, or $3.1 million, in manufacturing
profits during the first three months of this year.
   Dekker said the results had caused a ``crisis of confidence'' in
the financial world because Van der Klugt had claimed the company
was performing far better.
   ``The problem is that expectations were raised ... and that
there is such a huge difference between the expectations and the
real results,'' Dekker said.
   ``That is about the worst thing that can happen to a company,''
he added.
   After the May 3 announcement, Philips stock plummeted 16.7
percent from 37.70 guilders, or $19.84, a share to 31.40 guilders,
or $16.52, last Friday.
   But Philips stock rose 2 guilders, or $1.05, today as investors
were encouraged by the announcement.
   Van der Klugt's replacement followed a highly unusual
intervention by Dekker, Philips' president from 1982-86 and the
current chairman of its board of supervisors.
   The supervisory board maintains an oversight function at
Philips, although it is not involved in day-to-day management
operations.
   Dekker said the disappointing figures were primarily the result
of poor performance by the company's Integrated Circuits and
Information Systems Division.
   ``It was a great leak from which money simply flowed,'' said
Dekker, who refused to disclose specific figures.
   Gert Lorentz, the division's chief, is also resigning, Dekker
said.
   Philips first-quarter results contrasted with a 222 million
guilder, or $116 million, profit in the same period last year.
   The first-quarter figure for this year did not include a
one-time gain of 330 million guilders, or $173 million, from a
sell-off of Philips' defense activities, including the Hollandse
Signaal radar company.
   The episode has even prompted public comment from 85-year-old
Frits Philips, the last member of the Philips dynasty to have led
the firm. He criticized Van der Klugt for not providing earlier
warning of the poor earnings levels, according to Dutch press
reports.
   Dekker claimed it was unclear why the poor results were not
disclosed earlier.
   ``Van der Klugt has no proper explanation ... and it's a mystery
to me too,'' Dekker said.
   Ata Kahrel, an analyst with the Amsterdam-based brokerage H.
Wesselius and Co., said the flow of information to Philips'
management appeared to have failed, but said the reason why
remained unclear.
   Philips' computer division is ``probably just facing a malaise
... With just the slightest drop in demand they're stuck with these
huge stocks,'' Kahrel said.
   Philips itself has blamed its poor performance on currency
exchange problems and ballooning interest rates of recent months.
   The dramatic drop in Philips' stock price has spawned
speculation the firm might become a target for a hostile takeover
bid by one of its Japanese competitors.
   Based in this southern Dutch city, NV Philips Gloeilampen
Fabrieken has grown from a light bulb factory to one of the world's
largest producers of electric appliances and electronic equipment.
Its U.S. subsidiary is North American Philips.
   Van der Klugt, described by the authoritative Dutch newspaper De
Volkskrant as a remote, ivory-tower figure, took over from Dekker
in April 1986. He had been vice president since 1982.
   Timmer, who heads Philips' Consumer Electronics Division, has
brought the division into the black through cost-cutting measures
involving widespread staff reductions, earning him the Dutch
business page nickname of ``Hurricane Gilbert.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Higher In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
boosted by rain-related planting delays and new sales of U.S. wheat
to the Soviet Union.
   Rainy weekend weather in the Midwest has slowed corn planting
and pushed back the beginning of soybean planting, analysts said.
Forecasts for showers around the region this week prompted buying
on speculation of further delays.
   In the wheat market, buying interest was fueled by the
Agriculture Department's announcement this morning that the Soviet
Union bought nearly 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   Today's early strength contrasts strongly with a sharp drop
Friday in the soybean and wheat markets.
   Friday's losses followed a USDA crop report that contained
larger-than-expected projections for this year's U.S. wheat and
soybean production.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were { cent to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.82 a bushel;
corn was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $2.87{ a
bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with May at $1.59{ a
bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents higher with May at $6.33
a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were
mostly lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
June at 73.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with May at 84.72 cents a pound; hog futures were
.15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 63.47 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .05 cent to .70 cent lower with May at
63.30 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 951 up, 491
down and 459 unchanged.
   Last week's upsurge moved the market into position to challenge
the Dow's record closing high of 2,810.15 reached on Jan. 2.
   The rally has been attributed to a sudden favorable swing in
economic statistics of late, which has reduced worries over
inflation and the interest-rate outlook.
   Open-market interest rates were steady to slightly lower today
after dropping sharply on Friday. Yields on long-term government
bonds, which topped 9 percent a couple of weeks ago, stood in the
8.63 percent-8.67 percent range.
   Brokers say the drop in rates touched off a rush to buy stocks
among money managers at investing institutions who had been sitting
on large cash reserves.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express gained ~ to
29|; Philip Morris | to 44~; DuPont 1\ to 39~; General Electric \

1.59 to 193.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.61 at 354.11.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 104.83 million shares at

   Shares on London's stock exchange made their
largest daily gain since July to finish Monday well above the
psychologically important 2,200-level despite sluggish afternoon
trading.
   The Financial-Times Stock Exchange 100-share index closed at
2,214,5, up 38.6 points, or 1.78 percent, from Friday. The intraday
low of 2,202 was reached just after the market opened.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 24.7 points to close at
1,733.5.
   Volume was a relatively thin 375.1 million shares, compared with
the moderate 510.1 million shares that changed hands Friday.
   The Financial Times 500 index finished up 17.56 at 1,193.93.
   Dealers said strength on Wall Street added fuel to an early
rally that was sustained throughout the session and exaggerated by
a shortage of stock.
   Meanwhile, the market largely ignored some gloomy economic news
released around midday that showed gains in April in British retail
sales and producer prices, pointing to continued high inflation.
   The government reported a 1 percent rise in April retail sales
from March, surpassing market expectations of a 0.3 percent monthly
rise, and a 2.4 percent annual increase in sales.
   The April provisional producer price index showed output prices
rising 1.. Some houses have
had ``For Sale'' signs for a year, meaning their sellers are eager
for action and possibly willing to help with financing.
   Add at least one more reason: Opportunity exists in a time
frame. Youth comes once in a lifetime, and real estate bargains
appear only a few times more often. Few segments of the marketplace
are more cyclical.
   There is little question that younger homebuyers have had
difficulties in recent years.
   While the ownership rate fell generally in the 1980s, from more
than 65 percent at the beginning to less than 64 percent near the
end, the decline was a consequence solely of bad times in the
younger age groups.
   In the age group 25 through 29 years, for example, the 1979
ownership rate was 44 percent, but just over 35 percent in
mid-1989. In that time the rate for ages 30-34 fell from 62 percent
to less than 54 percent.
   Meanwhile, in every five-year age grouping from 60 years or more
the ownership rate rose. Since 1980, the rate for ages 60-64 has
been more than 80 percent.
   Real estate people point out that in those statistics lies
opportunity. They call attention to the likelihood that many older
homeowners are not just eager to sell but may be in a position to
help with financing.
   Why should a seller want to help with financing? First, of
course, to sell the house, but then to obtain a double-digit rate
of return backed by solid collateral.
   The financing picture is ever-changing, usually for the better.
While it is true that many banks have been burned, and therefore
are increasingly strict in appraising properties and potential
buyers, most still want to lend.
   Finding the best lender isn't nearly as difficult as it once
was, either.
   With the multiplication of mortgage products, mortgage
specialists have become institutions in many communities, and are
thoroughly knowledgeable about what individual banks offer. They
can choose the right one, and for no fee.
   At the same time, many real estate agents have developed
arrangements with lenders in their areas, enabling them to
originate mortgages right from their sales offices. In most
instances, the real estate agent will charge a fee.
   This practice has developed into open warfare between the
Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which seeks to have the
practice banned, and the National Association of Realtors, which
views it as an effective sales tool.
   For the time being, would-be buyers can afford to let the two
groups fight it out, either through legislation or the courts, and
accept the best of what either has to offer.
   They should be aware, however, that a fee may be charged, and
they should understand that they, themselves, bear responsibility
for making certain that the loan conditions are indeed the best
obtainable.

   The U.S. dollar closed mixed Monday against other
major foreign currencies in European trading.
   Gold prices, meanwhile, were little changed.
   Currency dealers said news of a major loss by West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative Christian Democractic Union
party in two state elections Sunday boosted the dollar against the
mark.
   ``The election outcome wasn't really favorable for the D-mark,''
said a trader at a large European bank in Frankfurt. ``It looks
like the dollar has recovered a bit from last week's weakness.''
   European markets, however, didn't react to news that U.S.
business inventories were unchanged in March, dealers said. The
economic indicator was fully in line with expectations, they added.
   Traders predicted quiet trading before the release, later in the
week, of several other U.S. economic indicators.
   The Japanese yen continued to recoup major losses suffered
earlier this year, dealers said. One trader said the more stable
Japanese stock exchange justifies a stronger yen.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 153.35 Japanese yen from
154.15 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 152.75
yen.
   In London, the British pound was unchanged from Friday's close
at $1.6817. By midday in New York it traded at $1.68025.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.6442 West German marks, up from 1.6300; 1.3952 Swiss francs, down
from 1.3955; 5.5430 French francs, up from 5.5096; 1.8472 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8330; 1,209.75 Italian lire, up from 1,200.40;
and 1.1767 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1783.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York, included: 152.845
Japanese yen, 1.6470 West German marks, 1.39475 Swiss francs,
1,209.60 Italian lire, and 1.17575 Canadian dollars.
   Gold bullion dealers said gold was locked in a narrow range and
they predicted trading volume would remain thin.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $369.75 a troy ounce,
up from $369.05 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $368.75 an
ounce, down from $368.80 Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 0.97 cents to close at a bid
$369.10 an ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.09 a
troy ounce, up from $5.06 Friday.

   Shares of electronics giant NV
Philips bounced back Monday after a dramatic shakeup that saw its
president and the head of its computer business resign due to a
``crisis of confidence'' among shareholders.
   News that President Cor van der Klugt would resign on July 1, a
year before his scheduled retirement, pushed NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken up the equivalent of $1.05 to close at $17.57
a share in Amsterdam.
   The company's stock had plummeted 16.7 percent since the May 3
disclosure that Philips, a flagship of Dutch industry, had barely
broken even during the first quarter of the year.
   Philips, the world's second-largest electronics concern after
Japan's Matsushita, is a leading maker of lighting equipment,
consumer electronics, home appliances and semiconductors.
   Product brand names include Philips and Magnavox televisions,
Polygram records, Norelco appliances and Philips light bulbs. The
company also holds a 47 percent stake in the Whirlpool
International BV appliance-making joint venture.
   Wisse Dekker, the former Philips president who heads the
company's board of supervisors, told reporters that Van der Klugt
had maintained until just before the profit figures were released
that the company was doing much better.
   ``The problem is that expectations were raised ... and that
there is such a huge difference between the expectations and the
real results,'' said Dekker, who was Philips president from 1982-86.
   ``That is about the worst thing that can happen to a company,''
he said.
   Dekker told reporters that Van der Klugt apparently was unaware
in advance of the poor first-quarter results, which did not include
a one-time $173 million gain from sale of Philips' defense
businesses.
   ``Van der Klugt has no proper explanation ... and it's a mystery
to me, too,'' said Dekker, who flew home from a vacation in the
United States to deal with the crisis.
   The board of supervisors maintains an oversight role at Philips
although it is not involved in day-to-day management.
   Dekker said he held several days of intensive talks with Van der
Klugt and Gert Lorentz, head of the computer division. Van der
Klugt decided to quit after consulting with the board and Lorentz
also tendered his resignation.
   Replacing Van der Klugt will be his deputy, Jan Timmer, whose
38-year track record with Philips includes bringing profitability
to its Polygram records subsidiary and the Consumer Electronics
Division he now heads.
   Timmer _ whose reputation for widespread staff reductions has
earned him the Dutch business page nickname of ``Hurricane
Gilbert'' _ already had been slated to replace Van der Klugt on
July 1, 1991.
   Neither Van der Klugt nor Timmer attended Monday's news
conference.
   Shareholders are expected to approve the personnel changes at an
extraordinary meeting expected to be convened about July 1, Dekker
said.
   Jan Stoop, an Amsterdam-based executive of the Barclays de Zoete
Wedd investment bank, said Monday's rallying of Philips stock
reflected ``pure sentiment that Timmer could be the man to turn
'round the company.
   ``That is sentiment for the short term, for in the longer term
the mood has to be one of wait and see,'' Stoop said.
   Philips reported a profit of only $3.15 million in the first
three months of this year, not including the gain from the defense
unit sale. That compared with a profit of $116 million for the
corresponding 1989 period.
   Philips has blamed its poor results on unfavorable currency
conversion rates and the soaring interest rates of recent months,
although analysts have indicated Van der Klugt's optimistic
forecasts indicated problems with the company's control over its
far-flung businesses.
   Dekker said the worst losses were suffered by Philips'
Integrated Circuits and Information Systems Division, which faces
fierce Japanese and South Korean competition.
   Dekker would not disclose specific losses at the computer
division.
   Ata Kahrel, an analyst at the Amsterdam brokerage H. Wesselius
and Co., said the division was ``probably just facing a malaise ...
With just the lightest drop in demand, they're stuck with these
huge stocks.''

   The Supreme Court today squelched a lawsuit
charging the United Steelworkers union with negligence in a 1972
Idaho silver mine disaster that killed 91 miners.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said the state court suit was
pre-empted by federal labor law.
   The disaster occurred May 2, 1972, at the Sunshine Mine in
Kellogg. The U.S. Bureau of Mines said an underground fire
apparently started when timbers and debris ignited spontaneously.
The miners died of asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning.
   Families of dead miners sued the union on grounds it appointed a
member to the mine's safety committee. The union member had
accompanied the company safety engineer in monthly inspections.
   The union was accused of negligence for the alleged failure of
its member to point out or correct such problems as corroded
oxygen-breathing equipment and padlocked rescue equipment.
   The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that the union could be
sued in state court.
   But the nation's highest court ordered the Idaho court to
restudy its ruling in light of a 1987 decision in which the
justices gave unions nationwide more protection against being sued
in state courts.
   That 1987 ruling said such lawsuits generally are pre-empted by
federal labor law.
   The Idaho Supreme Court, after restudying the silver mine
disaster case, said the negligence claims in it were different
because a union member was on the mine inspection team.
   Writing for the high court today, Justice Byron R. White said
the Idaho court was wrong.
   White said the negligence claim ``cannot be described as
independent of the collective-bargaining agreement.''
   ``The union's representatives were participating in the
inspection process pursuant to the provisions of
collective-bargaining agreement,'' he said.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony M.
Kennedy and Antonin Scalia dissented.
   Writing for the three, Kennedy said none of the union's
arguments ``for displacing Idaho law without any trial on the
merits has validity.''
   George Cohen, the union's Washington, D.C., counsel, who argued
the case March 26, called the ruling ``a complete vindication of
our position.''
   ``The Supreme Court has held that, insofar as a union is
enforcing a safety and health article of collective bargaining ...
it is governed exclusively by federal labor law principles,'' Cohen
said.
   Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, attorney Ken Howard said he would reserve
comment until after reading the court's opinion.
   The case is United Steelworkers vs. Rawson, 89-322.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Securities Fraud Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection in the securities fraud trial of
Ivan Boesky associate John A. Mulheren Jr. began Monday with
questions about key players in Wall Street's insider trading
scandal.
   About 100 citizens on the panel of potential jurors were asked
in a questionnaire whether they had ever heard of Michael Milken,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Boesky, the convicted stock
speculator who was Mulheren's one-time friend and business
associate.
   Mulheren, 40, is on trial in U.S. District Court on 41 counts of
conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and record-keeping
violations involving his relationship with Boesky.
   The indictment claims that Mulheren and Boesky, then among the
nation's most powerful speculators in stocks of takeover targets,
schemed to inflate the price of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. shares and
conceal ownership of large blocks of stock.
   Boesky, released recently after serving two years of a
three-year prison term, is expected to deliver his first public
testimony at the trial. He paid $100 million in penalties and
pleaded guilty to one felony to settle the biggest insider trading
case ever.
   Boesky's cooperation with prosecutors aided in many other
insider trading cases, including the guilty pleas of Drexel last
year and Milken, who ran the firm's junk bond department, last
month.
   Mulheren, whose firm Jamie Securities is now defunct, was known
as a daring trader who wore jeans and boat shoes to the office. He
carried over his casual style of dressing to the courtroom on
Monday, wearing a yellow open-neck shirt and khaki pants.
   In February 1988, police arrested Mulheren leaving his Rumson,
N.J., mansion with a loaded Israeli-made assault rifle and a pair
of army fatigues stuffed in a gym bag in the back seat of his
Mercedes.
   According to court documents, Mulheren intended to shoot Boesky
and Boesky's chief trader, Michael Davidoff, because ``without them
the head hunt would be over.''
   Doctors for Mulheren later said the episode happened because
Mulheren had stopped taking the prescribed drug lithium to treat
manic depression.
   New Jersey authorities dropped weapons possession charges in
exchange for three years of pretrial probation. Mulheren also
surrendered his gun collection.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European food concern TLC Beatrice International
Inc. reported Monday that it narrowed its first-quarter loss over a
year ago due to strength in its food distribution and grocery
products.
   For the first three months of 1990, the company lost $2.19
million, or 23 cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.50
million, or 25 cents a share, a year ago.
   Sales rose 25 percent to $310 million from $248 milion.
   Although TLC Beatrice remained in the red, first-quarter
operating income nearly doubled to $3.8 million from $1.9 million,
the company said.
   Before preferred stock dividends the company earned $133,000 in
the first quarter, it said.
   ``Our first-quarter results are encouraging because virtually
all of our operating units are performing well,'' Reginald F.
Lewis, company chairman and principal stockholder, said in a
statement.
   ``While we expect excellent results for the remainder of the
year, our second- and third-quarter figures will determin our
full-year results because our ice cream and dessert products are
being sold during the warm weather period.''
   A group of investors led by Lewis bought Beatrice's
international food operations for $985 million in December 1987.
The entire company was taken private the previous year by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the leader in debt- financed takeovers known
as leveraged buyouts.
   All of the high-yield ``junk'' bonds used to finance the TLC
Beatrice acquisition have been retired, according to the company.

   The president and chief executive officer of

to become dean of the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth
University.
   Fox will leave the company, known as Sallie Mae, around Labor
Day to assume his new position at the nation's oldest graduate

board, said Monday.
   Fox was Sallie Mae's first employee 17 years ago when he was
hired as its president and chief executive officer.
   King said the board of directors will meet this week to discuss
a successor.
   Sallie Mae is a federally chartered, stockholder-owned

bondlike investments to the public. It also provides other
financial services to financial and education institutions. The
corporation owns about 30 percent of all guaranteed student loans
outstanding today.

   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, extending the previous session's steep
losses amid concerns that rainy weather could force an expansion of
soybean acreage.
   Oat futures also closed lower while wheat and corn futures ended
mixed.
   Rainy weekend weather in the Midwest is believed to have slowed
the pace of corn planting in the region, which is also the nation's
premier soybean belt.
   With more rain expected this week, analysts said speculation is
brewing that some farmers may be unable to plant as much corn as
they had planned and will instead sow those acres with soybeans,
which can be planted later than corn.
   Corn planting has been under way for more than two weeks while
soybean planting has barely begun.
   Soybean futures plunged Friday after the Agriculture Department
released a crop report containing a higher-than-expected 1990
soybean production estimate.
   Wheat futures also fell sharply Friday but staged a modest
recovery Monday after the USDA announced the Soviet Union had
bought nearly 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 2} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.84\ a bushel; corn

<HEAD>Chief Financial Officer Retires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief financial officer of Bank of New England
Corp., one of the few senior executives who remained with the bank
after it reported huge losses this winter, says he plans to take
early retirement at age 54.
   David B. Payne will step down in July after 32 years with the
bank. Named to the top financial post last year, Payne came from
the bank's Connecticut subsidiary. He was named president at
Connecticut Bank and Trust Co. in 1988.
   ``I'm going home,'' Payne said. ``I always considered this a
short assignment and I let everybody know early on that I wanted to
go back to Hartford.''
   Late last year, the bank began to show huge losses primarily due
to bad loans in the plunging New England real estate market. The
$25 billion bank had more than $1 billion in losses last year.
   Federal regulators apparently sought the ouster of several top
bank executives. But Payne distanced himself from the problems and
escaped the purge.
   Lawrence K. Fish, the bank's new chairman, said Payne was
helpful as the bank struggled to set itself aright.
   ``His steadiness was especially valuable during the most
troubled times,'' Fish wrote in a letter to employees.
   Payne said he will stay on with the institution as outside
director of Constitution Capital Management, the bank's subsidiary
that oversees about $500 million in pensions and institutional
funds.
   First, however, ``I'm going to put my feet up for a couple of
months,'' Payne said Monday. ``The last year was 12 months but it
seemed like it was many more than that.''
   The bank had not named a successor to Payne, a spokesman said
Monday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Closing the United States to competition from
foreign banks would be ineffective and prompt retaliation against
U.S. banks, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a
congressional panel Monday.
   U.S. banks need less regulation, not protection from overseas
financial institutions, to compete in a rapidly changing
international marketplace, Greenspan and other witnesses told a
subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs
Committee.
   ``It would clearly be counterproductive to close our markets to
foreign competition merely because foreign markets are less open
than we like,'' Greenspan testified. ``Such an action would invite
retaliation and would not be very effective in any case.''
   Greenspan said foreign companies simply would funnel their
transactions through offshore banks that continue to do business in
America. He also said removing the competition of foreign banks
would reduce the pressure to update banking regulations, delaying
needed changes and harming U.S. banks and consumers.
   The subcommittee was meeting in Chicago to assess the
competitiveness of U.S. banks against their Far East counterparts.
   But witnesses also said the nation's banks soon could face stiff
international competition from European banks.
   By Jan. 1, 1993, European countries plan to eliminate many
internal trade barriers, forming a market the subcommittee's
witnesses said would surpass the United States in size and wealth.
   Some witnesses criticized U.S. regulations that bar banks from
certain lines of business. They said these regulations make it more
expensive for banks to attract deposits. That, in turn, limits the
ability of U.S. banks to compete against foreign banks that are
faced with fewer restrictions, the witnesses said.
   ``We believe the system now hampers the ability of our financial
institutions to effectively compete in the marketplace,'' said L.
William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
``It's hard to think of what more we can do to handicap our banks.''
   But Greenspan said the nation's low saving rate also hampers the
competitiveness of U.S. banks in foreign markets by lowering the
amount of money available to banks to loan out.
   Committee members and speakers disagreed on what steps would
strengthen U.S. banks' ability to compete overseas. Committee
Chairman Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., hinted broadly for sanctions
against countries with policies that lock out U.S. banks.
   ``In America, we say `Buy American,''' he said. ``In Japan, they
say, `Buy Japanese or else.' To those who seek to keep our
institutions out, I say, keep away.''
   Annunzio said Japanese banking concerns now own 40 percent of
the world's banking assets and foreign-owned banks hold 23 percent
of U.S. bank assets.
   ``If this rate of Japanese expansion continues, you will not get
dollars from an automatic teller machine, you will get yen,'' he
said.
   But representatives of Asian-based banks said their countries'
restrictions against U.S. banks were temporary and necessary to
protect local banks, which were ``ill-prepared to cope with the
competitive challenge of foreign banks.''
   ``The long-term objective of the Korean government, in my
opinion, is to provide a level playing field for both domestic and
foreign banks as they face ... a more deregulated, competitive
banking environment in Korea,'' said Chang Woo Lee, regional
managing director for Korea Exchange Bank.
   Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, argued against further bank
deregulation. She called the savings and loan industry crisis
compelling evidence that the financial community could not handle
it.
   ``We gave new powers to financial institutions, and now the
American people have to pay up $500 billion,'' she said, referring
to the federal bailout of the thrift industry.

<HEAD>Court Rules Price-Cutting Schemes Do Not Necessarily Violate Laws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Price-cutting schemes do not necessarily
violate federal antitrust laws, even if they hurt a competitor's
business, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.
   The justices voted 7-2 to end a lawsuit against Atlantic
Richfield Co. brought by independent gas stations in California and
Washington state.
   The court said that only when a company's price-cutting can be
proved to be ``predatory'' and harmful does it violate the federal
Sherman Act, a major antitrust law.
   Predatory pricing is defined as setting prices below the level
necessary to sell a product at a profit or below an appropriate
measure of the cost of producing the product.
   In other rulings Monday involving businesses, the justices:
   _Squelched a lawsuit charging the United Steelworkers of America
with negligence in a 1972 Idaho silver mine disaster that killed 91
miners. The justices said the state court suit was pre-empted by
federal labor law.
   Families of dead miners had sued the union in state court on
grounds it appointed a member to the mine's safety committee. The
union was accused of negligence for the alleged failure of its
member to point out or correct such problems as corroded
oxygen-breathing equipment and padlocked rescue equipment.
   _Refused without comment to allow 30 states to sue 26
manufacturers in the Supreme Court over removal of asbestos from
public schools and other government buildings. The ruling action
does not preclude the states from suing asbestos manufacturers in
their respective state courts.
   In the antitrust case, USA Petroleum Co., an independent oil
dealer, had accused Atlantic Richfield, or ARCO, of conspiring with
ARCO gas station dealers to fix prices illegally to drive the
independents out of business.
   ARCO contended that its plan _ which included lowering gasoline
prices to attract more customers and discontinuing credit card
sales to save money _ is legitimate.
   ARCO lawyers said the major company's share of the retail gas
market in California and Washington was 10 to 12 percent in 1981
and increased to 14 to 16 percent in 1983 because of lower prices.
   A federal judge threw out the lawsuit but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated it in 1988. The appeals court said that
although there was no proof ARCO engaged in predatory pricing, it
still may have injured USA Petroleum in violation of federal
antitrust law.
   But Justice William J. Brennan, who wrote the court's opinion,
said USA Petroleum had not suffered any antitrust injury.
   ``When a firm, or even a group of firms ... lowers prices but
maintains them above predatory levels, the business lost by rivals
cannot be viewed as an anticompetitive consequence,'' Brennan said.

   Stock prices climbed to record highs today,
extending the rally that carried the market sharply higher last
week.
   Last week's upsurge moved the market into position to challenge
the Dow's record closing high of 2,810.15 reached on Jan. 2.
   The rally has been attributed to a sudden favorable swing in
economic statistics of late, which has reduced worries over
inflation and the interest-rate outlook.
   Open-market interest rates kept falling today after dropping
sharply on Friday. Yields on long-term government bonds, which
topped 9 percent a couple of weeks ago, stood in the 8.58
percent-8.62 percent range.
   Brokers say the drop in rates touched off a rush to buy stocks
among money managers at investing institutions who had been sitting
on large cash reserves.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Mixed, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed Monday against major
foreign currencies in quiet, trendless dealings.
   Gold prices fell after rising overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $368.40 a troy ounce, down 40 cents from late
Friday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $368.10 an ounce, also 40 cents lower.
   Currency dealers said the market ignored a drop in interest
rates in the U.S. bond market and continued strength in stock
prices Monday.
   They said traders were marking time in anticipation of upcoming
government data that could provide a clearer picture of the
direction of the economy and interest rates.
   ``There were just no new fundamental factors today to drive the
dollar in any serious direction,'' said James T. McGroarty, a
senior vice president at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in
Greenwich, Conn.
   The government is set to release its report on industrial
production for April on Tuesday, April consumer prices and housing
starts on Wednesday, and March trade figures on Thursday.
   McGroarty said market sentiment is that the data will point to a
further weakening in the economy, which could result in lower
interest rates, and, subsequently, depress the dollar.
   ``The dollar sentiment is still quite negative,'' he said. The
feeling is that there's more of a chance that rates will decline.''
   The dollar continued to lose ground against the Japanese yen
following Friday's trouncing. Dealers say the yen is gaining
support on renewed investor confidence in Japan's economy.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell
to a closing 153.35 Japanese yen from 154.15 yen Friday. It traded
at 152.75 yen in London, and 152.50 yen New York, down from 152.70
yen Friday.
   The dollar was unchanged to weaker against the British pound.
Sterling cost $1.6817 in London, unchanged from Friday, and $1.6825
in New York, up from $1.6790.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.64288 West German marks, up from 1.6380; 1.3915
Swiss francs, down from 1.3995; 5.5360 French francs, up from
5.5295; 1,208.00 Italian lire, up from 1,207.75; and 1.17715
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17575.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, vs. late Friday: 1.6442 West German
marks, up from 1.6300; 1.3952 Swiss francs, down from 1.3955;
5.5430 French francs, up from 5.5096; 1.8472 Dutch guilders, up
from 1.8330; 1,209.75 Italian lire, up from 1,200.40; and 1.1767
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1783.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $369.75 an ounce from
$369.05 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $368.75 an ounce
from $368.80 Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 97 cents to close at a bid
$369.10 an ounce.
   Silver prices gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $5.066 a troy ounce, up from $5.043
Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.09 an ounce from $5.06.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Surge To 13-Month Highs On Ivory Coast Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices roared to their highest levels in more than
year Monday in a rally ignited by reports of renewed unrest in the
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures rose sharply; soybeans
plunged while grains were mixed; livestock and meat futures were
mixed; and precious metals were mixed.
   Cocoa futures settled $88 to $105 higher on New York's Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange with the contract for delivery in May at
$1,389 per metric ton, the highest settlement of a near-month cocoa
contract since April 3, 1989.
   The rally followed reports that solidiers had temporarily
surrounded the presidential palace and some radio and television
stations in the Ivory Coast capital of Abidjian, protesting wages
and living conditions.
   Protests by various sectors of Ivory Coast society have occurred
occasionally since early March after President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny ordered austerity measures to combat economic
distress caused by last year's collapse of cocoa prices.
   Houphouet-Boigny has since rescinded some of the measures and
has said multiparty elections will be held later this year.
   Yet traders remain closely attuned to the Ivory Coast situation
and tend to buy futures on signs of unrest, fearing cocoa shipping
could be disrupted, analysts said.
   ``The market is convinced this is a boiling pot,'' said Arthur
Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   He said traders fear a new government may not honor longstanding
cocoa supply agreements forged during Houphouet-Boigny's 30-year
reign.
   Analyst Stephen W. Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said
buying interest also may have been piqued by bullish comments made
over the weekend by Derek Chambers, a trader with Philipp Brothers
Inc. who is believed to be holding a large cash position in cocoa.
   Energy futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid reports that Saudi Arabia had cut oil production and Western
oil companies had agreed to reduce their purchase requests.
   Further buying was prompted by reports that loadings of cargo
from Brent oil platforms in the North Sea would be reduced in June
for maintenance.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 27 cents to 76
cents higher with June at $19.71 a barrel; heating oil was 1 cent
to 1.57 cents higher with June at 52.43 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .80 cent to 1.23 cents higher with June at 62.97 cents
a gallon.
   Soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending the previous session's steep losses amid concerns that
rainy weather could force an expansion of soybean acreage. Grain
futures ended mixed.
   Rainy weekend weather in the Midwest is believed to have slowed
the pace of corn planting in the region, which also is the nation's
soybean belt.
   The National Weather Service has predicted above-average
rainfall in the Midwest through mid-June. Analysts said speculation
is brewing that some farmers may be unable to plant as much corn as
they had planned and will instead sow those acres with soybeans,
which can be planted later than corn.
   Corn planting was 69 percent complete as of Sunday, according to
an Agriculture Department report. Soybean planting was 12 percent
done.
   Wheat futures staged a modest recovery Monday after the USDA
announced the Soviet Union had bought nearly 300,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat at subsidized prices. The USDA also said the Soviets
bought 150,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 2} cents higher with May
at $3.84\ a bushel; corn futures were { cent lower to 2\ cents
higher with May at $2.89} a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 4\ cents
lower with May at $1.56{ a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 13
cents lower with May at $6.23{ a bushel.
   Pork bellies for May delivery plunged the permitted daily limit
of 2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on signs of
slack demand and lower wholesale pork prices. Hog futures also
retreated while cattle futures were mixed.
   Live cattle settled .12 cent lower to .32 cent higher with June
at 73.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .05
cent higher with May at 84.75 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .18 cent lower with June at 63.50 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to 2 cents lower with May at 62
cents a pound.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 60 cents
lower across the board with June at $369.90 a troy ounce; silver
was 1.9 cents to 2.3 cents higher with May at $5.066 a troy ounce.

   The chairman of Sony Corp. told some 700
graduates at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School on
Monday that helping people is more important than making money.
   ``Though monetary compensation is important for all of us to
survive, it cannot be the reason for working,'' Akio Morita said in
a commencement address at the graduate school of business.
   ``What we must achieve in work, and in life, is something which

us to our heart. It must be somns deeper than oething more. More than an
all-consuming drive to look out for number one,'' said Morita, who
earlier was given an honorary doctor of law degree at graduation
exercises for Penn's 4,900 undergraduates.
   Morita said the role today's graduates and future business
people choose must be more than ``merely an unending, personal
quest for the dollar, or yen, or D-mark.''
   ``You should strive to create an atmosphere where management and
employees can come together to develop and reach common goals.
Mutual recognition and mutual respect must be instilled,'' he said.
   ``You must recognize the worth of the individual and respect his

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp., the parent of the 7-Eleven
convenience store chain, said Monday that tax benefits from past
red ink helped reduce its first quarter loss by nearly 60 percent.
   The company _ which has turned to Japanese investors for help in
avoiding junk-bond-induced bankruptcy _ said it lost $69.44
million, or 35 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31,
compared with $169.43 million, or 86 cents, in the same period last
year.
   Revenue rose 2 percent to $1.94 billion from $1.90 billion.
   This year's quarter was helped by a $52 million tax benefit from
past losses carried forward. Pre-tax losses from continuing
operations increased to $161.98 million from $137.95 million.
   Southland was taken private in December 1987 by the founding
Thompson family in a $4.9 billion leveraged buyout financed with
high-yield ``junk'' bonds.
   The company has struggled under the debt load, and has sold off
its gasoline refinery and other operations to help pay down the
notes. The company said Monday it had paid $1.59 billion on senior
bank term loan since the buyout, including $399.5 million this
year, and still owes $900.4 million.
   In March, Southland announced a complicated restructuring
involving the sale of $400 million of Southland stock to Ito-Yokado
Ltd., which operates 7-Eleven stores in Japan. The sale would give
Ito-Yokado 75 percent of the company's common stock, leaving 15
percent in Thompson hands.
   The deal is contingent on bondholders approving the
restructuring of $1.8 billion in debt and preferred stock. Some
analysts have expressed doubts the bondholders, who would forego
about $1.4 billion, would go along with the plan.
   Southland operates the world's largest convenience store chain,
with 6,900 company-owned stores and 5,900 run by licensees and
affiliates.

   Businesses held inventories steady while
increasing sales in March, the government said Monday.
   Analysts said the report indicated little threat of production
cutbacks or loss of jobs.
   The Commerce Department reported that shelf and backlot
inventories were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted $794 billion.
Backlogs had fallen 0.4 percent in February and risen 0.3 percent
in January.
   Sales rose 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted $539.1 billion
following gains of 1.4 percent in February and 0.4 percent in
January. The February increase was first reported at 1.3 percent.
   ``What it (the report) means is that producers are looking very
realistically at domestic demand and the possibility of a slowing
overseas demand for U.S.-made goods and are bringing production in
line with those expectations,'' said Gilbert Benz, an economist
with the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York.
   ``Unlike a period of slow growth where businesses often get
caught short with an excess buildup of stocks, in the current
environment, we see they are anticipating a slowdown and adjusting
production so they don't have to slash inventories and cut
production radically,'' he added.
   March business activity produced a 1.47 ratio of inventories to
sales, matching a January 1989 ratio that was the lowest since the
current economic expansion began after the 1981-82 recession. The
ratio means that it would take 1.47 months to exhaust inventories
at the March pace. It peaked at 1.70 in October 1982.
   The decline in inventories was greatest in the manufacturing
sector, dropping 0.3 percent for the second straight month.
However, backlogs edged up 0.2 percent at the wholesale level after
declining 0.3 percent in February. Retail inventories gained 0.3
percent after posting a 0.7 percent loss the previous month.
   Sales, on the other hand, dropped 0.2 percent at the retail
level and the Commerce Department reported last week that retail
sales fell another 0.6 percent in April, the biggest plunge in six
months.
   But manufacturing sales rose 1.1 percent. Wholesale sales
advanced 0.8 percent.

<TEXT>
   Playboy Enterprises Inc. is hoping no nudes will
be good news for its bottom line, at least as far as its stock
certificates are concerned.
   Ever since Playboy went public in 1971, its stock certificates
have been graced with the nude image of February 1971 Playmate
Willy Rey.
   But Playboy said Monday it will replace the nude figure with a
clothed one in conjunction with a recapitalization plan unveiled
last week.
   The change is expected to save the Chicago-based company money.
   The unusual design gave the stock a certain measure of novelty
appeal. Spokeswoman Terri Tomcisin said Playboy has about 14,000
single-share stockholders _ about six times as many as most other
companies its size _ many of whom bought one share just to get the
racy stock certificate.
   The problem, she said, is that it costs Playboy about $100,000
annually to service the accounts of those shareholders.
   Playboy hopes to reduce that expense through its
recapitalization.
   The plan includes a reverse stock split _ one new share of Class
A voting stock for two old shares, plus a dividend of three new
shares of Class B non-voting stock for each new share of Class A
stock.
   Stockholders with just one share of Playboy would get only a
check _ $12.62{ at Monday's closing price _ and a facsimile of the
old stock certificate.
   Ms. Tomcisin said the design of the new stock certificates will
include someone's image. And although she said she didn't know who
it will be, they will be clothed to discourage novelty purchases.
   Ms. Tomcisin laughed at a suggestion that Playboy founder Hugh
Hefner may be pictured on the certificate.
   All she knows, she said, is that the new design ``will somehow
reflect the fact that the company is a global company.''

<HEAD>Report: Chrysler OKs Production of 2-Seat Sports Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. has approved limited production of
the Dodge Viper, a two-seat sports car billed as a performance and
price rival to the Chevrolet Corvette, AutoWeek magazine reported
Monday.
   Two versions of the Viper will be built, probably as 1992 models
and delivered in mid- to late 1991, AutoWeek said in a report in
its May 21 issue.
   The rear-wheel-drive car will cost between $30,000 and $40,000.
One version will be powered by a 318-cubic-inch V-8 engine,
AutoWeek said. The other will offer a V-10 engine developed in part
by Chrysler subsidiary Lamborghini and capable of reaching 100 mph
in less than 10 seconds, the magazine said.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca was expected to formally announce
production of the Viper on Friday in Los Angeles, the magazine said.
   A concept version of the Viper was seen as long ago as January
1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz and Thomas Gale, vice
president of product design, have supported production of the Viper
while awaiting Iacocca's decision.
   Iacocca said in July 1989 that he was leaning toward approving
the Viper.
   Such an exotic product might not be expected to emerge from a
slumping auto market and Chrysler's $1-billion cost-cutting
program. But the Viper was the first project to result from
Chrysler's conceptual design and rendering system. The
computer-driven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time
needed to bring a totally new car to market, Gale said last year.

<TEXT>
   The state of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit
Monday against seven of the state's largest car insurers in an
effort to force them to cut rates under the state's revamped auto
insurance law.
   The complaint, filed in Commonwealth Court, also claims the
companies have been acting in concert to undermine the new law,
which calls for rate rollbacks of at least 10 percent beginning in
July.
   Last week Gov. Robert P. Casey vowed to wage ``war'' against
insurance companies that attempt to pull out of the Pennsylvania
market to avoid rate cuts. The suit appeared to be an early shot
aimed at those companies and others that failed to meet a May 1
deadline to file new rates with the state Insurance Department.
   Named in the suit were State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance
Co., State Farm Fire and Casualty Insurance Co., Allstate Insurance
Co., Erie Insurance Exchange, Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.,
Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. and Erie Insurance Co.
   The suit also names the state's assigned risk plan, an insurance
pool run by companies for motorists with bad driving records.
Together, the defendants write nearly half the car insurance in the
state.
   ``These companies are not above the law,'' Casey said at a news
conference, promising that the suit would be a first step toward
ensuring the law takes effect and motorists realize savings.
   A spokesman for Aetna said the accusations were ``outrageous and
simply untrue.''
   ``This company never has and never will conspire in any of its
business dealings,'' said spokesman John Hawkins. ``Today's action
by the governor further deflects attention from the real issue,
which is making auto insurance more affordable in Pennsylvania.''
   Since its enactment in February, the law has been attacked by at
least 29 separate lawsuits.
   The law requires companies to cut rates 10 percent for all
drivers and 22 percent for motorists who give up their right to sue
in most cases. The law also includes a one-year rate freeze, a cap
on medical costs and provisions to fight fraud.

   Environmental activists took aim Monday at
producers of single-use, throwaway packages for such products as
juice and laundry detergent and cameras.
   Several private groups and Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., said
they had designated ``Wastemaker Awards'' for Coca-Cola Corp. for
packaging Minute Maid juice in nonrecyclable boxes wrapped in
plastic, Eastman Kodak for its single-use Fling camera and
Colgate-Palmolive for Fab One Shot laundry detergent.
   Pallone, Clean Water Action, Environmental Action Foundation and
the U.S. Public Interest Group said the products were wasteful and
cost more. They asked corporations to take the products off the
market.
   Bob Murray, a spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive in New York City,
said the company agreed the packaging for the Fab One Shot
detergent was excessive and he said it was being redesigned.
   The new package will eliminate the plastic tray and plastic
overwrap, incorporate recycled board and take up less shelf space,
said Murray.
   Officials at Coca-Cola headquarters in Atlanta and Kodak in
Rochester, N.Y. did not return phone calls Monday.
   The groups' ``awards'' also cited Worthington Industries Inc. of
Columbus, Ohio, for the Celebrate Birthday Balloon Kit with a
disposable helium tank; Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. of Madison, Wis.,
for Lunchables single-use portions of lunch meat, cheese and
crackers, and SOS Juniors steel wool soap pads, sold by Miles Inc.
of Chicago.
   Joe Stegmayer, vice president of Worthington, said the firm's
helium tank is recyclable.
   ``It's made all of steel. If people do throw it away, there are
systems in most communities that pull metal out. There's no way
this should go into any landfill anywhere.''
   Dionn Tron, a spokeswoman for Miles at its Elkhart, Ind.,
headquarters, said the half-size soap pad was designed ``for
consumers who only use a soap pad once in a while,'' and don't want
to throw out a full-size pad that rusts between uses.
   ``If they use a junior, they only throw away half as much,'' Ms.
Tron said.
   Bang &amp; Olufsen of America Inc. was criticized for its Moving
Micro Cross Stylus. The record player stylus, which is less than an
inch long, was wrapped in ``a blatant, almost comical example of
excessive, wasteful packaging,'' the groups said. It consists of a
5{-inch plastic cylinder protected by two pieces of nonrecyclable
plastic foam, inside a nearly foot-long cardboard box.
   ``The Madison Avenue ad agencies have taught us to that when we
see these products, we should think `convenience,''' Pallone said.
``Our mission is to teach consumers that when they see these
products, they should think `waste and destruction of the
environment.'''
   ``We of course are not too happy to get such an award,'' said
Bang &amp; Olufsen president Leif Lundin from Mount Prospect, Ill. ``We
will seriously look into how we can change the package.''
   A telphone call to Oscar Mayer was not returned.

   Stock prices climbed to a record high Monday,
building on their rally of the last two weeks as interest rates
continued to ease.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 19.95 to 2,821.53,
extending its gain since April 27 to 176.48 points.
   In so doing the average surpassed its previous closing peak of
2,810.15, reached last Jan. 2. Most other, broader market measures
remained below their former highs, however.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,062 up, 555 down and 440 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 225.41 million
shares, against 234.04 million in the previous session.
   The rally has been attributed to a sudden favorable swing in
economic statistics of late, which has reduced worries about
inflation and the interest-rate outlook.
   ``You can almost hear the opinion change,'' said John Connolly,
head of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Open-market interest rates kept falling Monday after dropping
sharply on Friday. Yields on long-term government bonds, which
topped 9 percent a couple of weeks ago, stood in the 8.58
percent-8.62 percent range.
   Brokers say the drop in rates touched off a rush to buy stocks
among money managers at investing institutions who had been sitting
on large cash reserves.
   ``Nobody's in the market. Everybody's underinvested,'' said
Michael Metz, managing director and investment strategist at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Even so, prices pulled back in afternoon trading from their best
levels of the day, when the Dow Jones industrials sported a gain of
about 50 points. Brokers said prices reached levels where a good
many traders seized the chance to cash in their recent gains.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express gained { to
29\; Philip Morris { to 44}; DuPont 1} to 40&rsqb;; General Electric &rsqb;
to 68{, and International Business Machines \ to 114\.
   Two exceptions to the general uptrend were Federal Home Loan
Mortgage, down 1 at 69&lsqb;, and Federal National Mortgage, down ~ at
37~ as the most active NYSE issue.
   The stocks, up strongly in early trading, reversed course after
the Treasury recommended that they and other government-sponsored
enterprises be required to get top credit ratings from at least two
rating agencies independent of their implicit backing from the
government.
   Atlantic Richfield rose 2~ to 118}. The Supreme Court ruled in
the company's favor in a dispute with independent gasoline stations
in California and Washington.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 270.80 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $23.42 billion, or
0.70 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.41 to 193.65.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.17 to 412.62, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.75 at 354.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
3.51 to 441.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 354.34, up 1.84.

<HEAD>SEC Files Civil Suit Against President of Pager Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil lawsuit Monday accusing the president of a radio paging
services company of manipulating the price of his company's stock.
   The SEC early last month suspended trading in the stock of the
company, Southland Communications Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif.
   Southland president Ahmad Bayaa was accused of engaging in the
stock manipulation scheme with Shaw Terhrani, a broker with BC
Financial Corp. of Atlanta.
   The SEC complaint said that beginning in January 1989, Bayaa and
Terhrani began accumulating Southland securities in various broker
accounts opened in the names of friends and family members.
   As of April 11, they controlled more than 1 million shares, in
addition to the 898,800 owned by Bayaa and his wife, the SEC said
in the lawsuit filed in Manhattan's federal court.
   When Bayaa and Terhrani became worried that Southland's
financial condition would cause other investors to sell their
stock, they allegedly attempted to keep Southland stock off the
open market, the lawsuit said.
   The SEC said the men did this by arranging matched trades and by
negotiating an agreement with at least one brokerage firm not to
loan out Southland stock held in customer margin accounts.
   These practices caused the price of Southland stock to nearly
double, from $8.75 to $16.75, between March 13 and April 3,
according to the lawsuit.
   The SEC is seeking a court order compelling Bayaa and Tehrani to
give up their alleged illegal profits, which were not specified,
and freezing their assets.

<HEAD>Preliminary Count Shows Armstrong Wins 3 Seats, Company Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armstrong World Industries Inc. said a
preliminary count shows its candidates won three of four board
seats contested by the Belzberg family of Canada in a proxy fight.
   Armstrong also said Monday that shareholders had rejected five
amendments to the company's bylaws proposed by the Belzbergs.
   The Belzberg's own 10.7 percent of Armstrong through their
investment vehicle, First City Diversified Inc. Their efforts to
exercise greater control over the company prompted Pennsylvania
lawmakers to pass the nation's toughest anti-takeover law earlier
this year.
   Armstrong said an independent group of judges, Corporation Trust
Co., had found Armstrong nominees received about two-thirds of the
votes cast while the Belzberg slate received about one-third.
   A spokesman for First City said Armstrong has yet to give the
Belzbergs any meaningful breakdown of the vote.
   Shareholders voted at their annual meeting April 30 to elect
four directors to the company's 13-member board. An Armstrong
spokesman said the company has 47,150,000 shares outstanding, and
83 percent of them were voted in the election.
   Official results should be available within the next few days,
Armstrong said.
   ``We're delighted that our shareholders have backed us so
solidly,'' said William W. Adams, Armstrong chairman and president.
   ``The fact that such a large portion of shares was voted in
support of our board's nominees and not voted in favor of the
Belzbergs' proposals is highly gratifying,'' he said.
   The Belzbergs contend that the company improperly voted 5
million shares of stock in its employees stock ownership plan on
its behalf in the proxy fight.
   Edward E. Scharff, spokesman for First City, said those shares
technically aren't owned by anybody because they have not yet been
distributed to the employees. ``They shouldn't have been voted for
anybody,'' he said.
   Scharff also disputed the company's claim that the Belzbergs'
proposed amendments had been defeated. He said that if the shares
in the employee stock ownership plan were excluded, the Belzberg's
position would have carried.
   ``It's possible, if not likely, that the five shareholders'
rights proposals would have carried overwhelmingly,'' Scharff said.
   The proposed changes are being argued in federal court in
Reading, Pa.
   One proposal would allow a shareholder or group owning 20
percent or more of the stock to call special shareholder meetings.
The company's position is that shareholders have the right to ask
the board, at its discretion, to call meetings.
   Adams said he could not yet confirm First City's claim to have
elected one of its candidates, Harvard business professor Michael
E. Jansen, to the board.
   ``But if so, we would hope that as he learns more about our
company, he will make a substantial contribution to Armstrong and
its continuing success,'' Adams said.
   Armstrong management has declined to meet with the Belzbergs.
The family has publicly criticized the company for supporting
Pennsylvania's new anti-takeover law and accused management of
working against shareholder interests.
   Conversely, Armstrong has characterized the Belzbergs as inept
managers who have driven companies virtually into the ground,
compromising shareholder earnings.

   Varian Associates Inc., an electronics
company, said it will cut 600 jobs, consolidate facilities and
re-evaluate assets by the end of September.
   The company will take a one-time charge of $74 million during
the fiscal third quarter ending June 29, resulting in a loss for
the period. In the same period last year, Varian earned $9.2
million on sales of $334 million.
   Primarily support staff will lose their jobs, a spokesman said
Monday.
   Varian plans to sell its divisions in Texas and England that
make radio and television transmitters. It also will abandon its
production of gallium arsenide computer chips, which are used
primarily by the military but have not generated much of a
commercial market.
   Varian also will sell its night-vision goggle division.
   ``A number of the activities we plan to exit should present
interesting opportunities for others,'' said J. Tracy O'Rourke, who
joined Varian as chairman and chief executive officer in March,
promising to ``reposition'' the company.
   ``But in our particular situation, they proved to be a diversion
that was no longer acceptable or affordable,'' he said.
   The divisions represent sales of $200 million and employ 1,600
people.

<HEAD>Workers Go on Strike at Hyundai Motor Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 27,000 union workers went on
strike Tuesday over pay and working conditions at Hyundai Motor
Co., halting production at South Korea's largest auto plant.
   Union and company officials said more than 22,000 day-shift
workers showed up at the plant in Ulsan, 200 miles southeast of
Seoul, for a solidarity rally Tuesday morning. They refused to work
following the union's decision the previous night to launch an
indefinite general strike.
   The walkout came only a week after the plant, which produces
2,650 vehicles a day, reopened following a weeklong strike. That
walkout was in sympathy with workers at the nearby Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. shipyard, where protests were crushed by a police
raid April 28.
   Officials of Hyundai Motor Co. threatened to seek punitive legal
action against union leaders charging that they launched the latest
strike without going through required legal procedures.
   Howwever, the union leadership denied the charge and said the
strike was called to press union demands after failing to reach
agreement with management on a contract despite 22 rounds of
negotiations since Feb. 13.
   Among other things, workers are demanding an 18.95 percent raise
in their average monhtly pay of the equivalent of about $621, and a
reduction in their work week to 42 hours from 44.
   The company says it can give only a 5.95 percent wage hike.
   Hyundai Motor Co. sold 589,000 vehicles, including cars and
trucks, in 1989. It exported 200,000 vehicles, mostly subcompact
cars.
   Hyudnai Motor's public relations section said a total of 29,000
workers are employed at the Ulsan plant, including 27,000 union
members.
