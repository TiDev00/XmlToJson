<HEAD>Canadian Officials Hold Talks With Indian Leaders to End Standoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers tightened their encirclement of
armed Mohawk warriors Wednesday but federal officials met with
Indian leaders to try to end the confrontation.
   About 400 soldiers have surrounded 20 Mohawk warriors and 30
women and children in a small wooded area bordered by a highway and
a lake on the Kahnesatake settlement near Oka, 18 miles west of
Montreal.
   On Wednesday, the soldiers ringed the Mohawk stronghold with
razor wire, and provincial police set up a floating barricade on
the lake to prevent boats from entering or leaving the compound.
   In Ottawa, native leaders met with federal Indian Affairs
Minister Tom Siddon and Solicitor General Pierre Cadieux.
   Georges Erasmus, head of the Assembly of First Nations, a major
Indian group, said both the federal and Quebec governments must get
involved in a new round of negotiations to resolve the dispute.
   Erasmus urged the army to pull back from positions surrounding a
detoxification center occupied by the Mohawks.
   ``What we're concerned about is that an accident will happen or
somebody will lose the control they have over themselves,'' Erasmus
said. ``Then there will be the exchange of gunfire that nobody in
this country wants.''
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa broke off negotiations last week
and ordered the army in to remove barricades set up by Mohawks near
Oka and on the Mercier Bridge over the St. Lawrence River linking
Montreal with its southern suburbs.
   On Wednesday night, the Quebec government announced that the
Mercier Bridge would be reopened on Thursday morning for the first
time since July 11 when Mohawks from the Kahnawake reserve put up
barricades in sympathy with the Mohawks in Oka.
   The bridge's closure caused angry and at times violent
demonstrations by local residents who were forced to make long
detours to travel to Montreal.
   The barricades came down last week after the army reached an
agreement with the Kahnawake Mohawks.
   But Mohawks at the Kahnesatake settlement refused to remove
their barricades. The army moved in over the weekend to dismantle
the barricades and the Indians retreated to the wooded area around
the detoxification center.
   Members of the militant Mohawk Warrior's Society say they won't
lay down their arms without a new policing arrangement that would
curb the authority of the Quebec provincial police in the
settlement.
   The Mohawks fear reprisals for the death of a police officer
killed July 11 in a failed police attempt to remove barricades put
up in a dispute over plans by Oka town officials to expand a golf
course onto what the Indians say is tribal land. The clash sparked
the 2-month-old armed standoff.
   The dispute over the golf course expansion was solved when the
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to
the Indians. But the Mohawks have raised a wider range of
grievances, including demands for sovereignty.
   Also Wednesday, the army decided it will no longer allow food or
supplies such as film to reach 15 journalists still inside the
Kahnesatake compound. Mohawks, however, are allowed to bring in
food.
   The army said if the journalists decide to leave they won't be
allowed back in.
   When asked why, army spokesman Capt. Yvon Desjardins said,
``It's for their own security. ... They would be more secure if
they left.''

<HEAD>Pianist Dies of Apparent Heart Attack During Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feliz Ganz, a pianist and educator in the United
States and abroad, suffered an apparent heart attack and died in
the middle of a performance, officials said Wednesday. He was 68.
   Ganz was playing the harpsicord in a two-person recital before
about 200 people at Roosevelt University's Chicago Musical College
when he was stricken, school officials said.
   ``He was right in the middle of the concert when he slumped over
the keyboard,'' said Earl Schub, dean of Chicago Musical College.
``It was, as you can imagine, a very unbelievable sight and very
shocking.''
   He was pronounced dead at Northwestern Memorial Hospital at 2:17
p.m., a hospital administrator said.
   Ganz was a part-time professor of keyboard and of music history.
   He was born in Basel, Switzerland, and emigrated to the United
States in 1947 after graduating from the University of Basel. He
received a masters degree from Chicago Musical College in 1948 and
a doctorate from Northwestern University in 1960.
   Ganz was dean of Chicago Musical College from 1970 to 1981 and
served as a part-time professor and professor emeritus after his
retirement in 1988.
   He judged musical competitions, served as a lecturer and
contributed articles to music journals.

   The famed Pebble Beach Golf course
and associated resorts were sold Wednesday to a Japanese-owned
company, the buyer announced.
   Ben Hogan Properties, which is owned by Japan's Cosmo World
Corp., announced it bought Pebble Beach Co., one of California's
most expensive real estate holdings, with top-class golf courses
and resorts on Monterey Bay. The price paid to the private
partnership that owns Pebble Beach wasn't disclosed.
   A $543 million loan was taken out to finance the deal, according
to papers filed in the county recorder's office.
   Pebble Beach Co. owns and operates two luxury resorts and
several prestigious golf courses _ the Pebble Beach Golf Links, The
Lodge at Pebble Beach and the Inn and Links at Spanish Bay. It also
owns Spyglass Hill and Del Monte Golf Courses, 17-Mile Drive and
substantial amounts of real estate on the Monterey Peninsula south
of San Francisco.
   ``We are committed to operating Pebble Beach at the same high
standards that everyone has come to expect of this world class
property,'' David B. Hueber, president of Ben Hogan Properties,
said in a news release. Company officials said they didn't expect
to change the resort area's ``the management personnel or
management style.''

<HEAD>Gene Cloned for Brain Protein, May Help Improve Schizophrenia
Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists said today they had cloned a gene
that helps brain cells communicate, a step that may someday help in
treating schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and other brain
disorders.
   The gene tells brain cells how to make a structure called a
dopamine receptor, which receives a chemical messenger called
dopamine that brain cells send one another.
   Hyperactivity in this communication system may cause at least
some schizophrenia symptoms, and evidence suggests the
hyperactivity may result from abnormalities in dopamine receptors,
commented Dr. Lewis Judd, director of the National Institute of
Mental Health.
   The discovery will aid research into identifying receptor
abnormalities and the effect they have on brain cells, Judd said.
   The gene is for the so-called D1 dopamine receptor. The gene for
the other major kind of dopamine receptor, called D2, was cloned in
1988.
   The new work is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by three teams of scientists.
   The finding may someday let doctors diagnose schizophrenia and
Parkinson's before symptoms appear by identifying receptor
abnormalities, said Allen Dearry, a member of one of the research
teams.
   That could allow earlier treatment with greater chance of
success, he said.
   Parkinson's is a potentially disabling condition that can
include tremors, rigidity and gradual loss of spontaneous movement.
   Further work may also pave the way for better drugs to treat
psychosis, the loss of touch with reality seen in schizophrenia,
said Dearry, of the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.
   Scientists may be able to distinguish variants of the receptor
and design drugs to act only on those variants that affect
psychosis while avoiding variants that produce side effects, he
said.
   Most current standard anti-psychosis drugs include a risk of
such side effects as tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome of involuntary
movements that can affect the mouth, tongue, arms, leg or trunk.
   Dearry's group included scientists at Duke and the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute Laboratories there.
   Another group reporting the gene cloning is from the Oregon
Health Sciences University in Portland, and the third group is from
the University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md., the Yale
University School of Medicine, the Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto and the Addiction Research Foundation in Toronto.

   NASA says Magellan's $744 million
mission to map the rugged surface of Venus will begin later this
month even if engineers can't figure out why they twice lost radio
contact with the spacecraft.
   ``We're not willing to wait to understand what happened,''
Magellan experiment representative Steve Wall at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory said Wednesday.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a
looping, 948-million-mile trip that began when the spacecraft was
launched from the shuttle Atlantis 16 months ago.
   Magellan made its first pictures of Venus during an Aug. 16 test
but lost touch with Earth that night for 14 hours and lost contact
again for 17{ hours starting Aug. 21.
   Engineers will continue trying to determine the cause of the
failures, but computer commands being sent to Magellan should
enable engineers to restore contact quickly if it is lost again,
Wall said.
   Magellan is designed to use radar to peer through Venus' thick
clouds and make the most detailed maps and pictures yet of the
planet's deformed surface. The communications trouble delayed the
start of mapping last week.
   Officials expect to start the mapping sometime late this month,
Wall said.
   Magellan and Venus are about 153 million miles from Earth.
   The spaceship's initial pictures showed long faults, other areas
crisscrossed by many faults in a pattern resembling broken
automobile safety glass, solidified lava flows, volcanic cinder
cones, meteorite impact craters and extensive valleys and ridges.

<HEAD>At Black Sea Resort, Sand Curtain Separates Elite From Soviet

<TEXT>
   A 10-foot-high concrete barrier separates
the elite from the masses on the beach of this Black Sea resort,
illustrating the Soviet Union's failure to achieve a classless
society.
   The wall starts in the water and runs over the sand to separate
the Riviera, a public beach, from a vast playground reserved for
those with position and influence.
   No one seems to know the name of the private beach or the names
of those who use it. Little is known of the services provided, but
the sheer size of the sanctum raises eyebrows.
   On an average day, 15,000 people must crowd onto a public beach
only 750 yards long, while about 500 of the upper crust loll on an
expanse that stretches more than half a mile.
   Arkady Melkonyan, a state television correspondent, cited the
figures in a recent broadcast.
   Like Melkonyan, some citizens are indignant. Others shrug it off.
   ``The Martians live differently than we; why shouldn't they?''
Valery Skripnik, a 40-year-old gardener, said on the Riviera beach.
He spoke between chin-ups on an exercise bar.
   There is increasing criticism of reserving beaches, quality
medical care, luxury apartments, special planes and stores for
Communist Party and government officials in a country where
ordinary people live in cramped housing and stand in line for food
and other necessities.
   Some politicians, most notably Boris Yeltsin, president of the
Russian republic, have won wide popular support by attacking
privilege.
   Dozens of country homes have been converted from private
residences for the elite to public rest homes. The newspaper
Rabochaya Tribuna reported Aug. 8 that the number of aircraft
reserved for the privileged had been drastically reduced.
   Those who are more equal than others have a strong grip on
Sochi, however, and few of its facilities have gone public.
Melkonyan told viewers that, of the resort area's 151 beaches, only
22 were open to ordinary people.
   In addition to the reserved beaches, Sochi has elaborate private
resort complexes, known in Russian as sanatoriums. They do not
appear on maps, are generally visible only from the sea and are
heavily guarded.
   Down the beach from the Actors' Sanatorium and Pravda
Sanatorium, spas for actors and journalists, is the Dzerzhinsky
Sanatorium, the summer hideaway of KGB agents named for Felix
Dzerzhinsky, who founded the Soviet secret police.
   It begins at the seaside with a covered patio adorned with tall,
ornate yellow arches and white columns. An elevator takes
vacationers up a hill to a main building tucked into a thickly
wooded area.
   Exclusive beachfront facilities nearby include a small yellow
villa with white arches that was favored by Lavrenti Beria,
dictator Josef Stalin's chief of secret police.
   Farther along the Black Sea coast are the dachas, as the villas
are called, of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov and Anatoly I. Lukyanov.
   At least two resorts have been partly opened to the public after
decades of catering to the elite.
   The 180-acre Green Grove resort, once reserved for Communist
Party officials, received automotive workers from Gorky and
steelworkers from Magnitogorsk last year, director Ludmilla
Voblikova reported.
   Staffs of Communist Party schools, from janitors to instructors,
spend vacations at the complex on a wooded hill overlooking the sea.
   Voblikova has run the place since 1958, when privilege was not
questioned. She proclaimed allegiance to the new policy, but said:
``I think we should all work well, and the better we work, the
better we should live.''
   At nearby Lenin Sanitorium, the splendor formerly saved for
Communist Party officials now is available to workers from
collective farms.
   They live in a gray marble dormitory, built in 1984, that has
clean, carpeted, well-furnished rooms.
   An older building erected in the 1950s has an ``Italian
courtyard'' with colored tile, white columns and an ornate
fountain. In the main dining room are glass chandeliers, white
marble columns and parquet floors.

   So you think it's been a hot summer
where you live? Pity the folks in Nebraska, where it's been so hot
farmers have had to feed their chickens cracked ice to keep them
from laying hard-boiled eggs.
   Talk about hot _ an Iowa farmer says the sun was so intense one
day his cornfield exploded into fluffy white clouds of popcorn. His
cattle thought it was snowing and froze solid on the spot.
   Sure, everyone complains about the weather, but one man has
finally done something about it.
   Fred Pfister, an English professor at College of the Ozarks in
Point Lookout, has compiled a list of tall weather tales _ he calls
them ``weather windies'' _ that he's heard on his travels around
the country.
   Pfister, a native of Missouri's Ozarks, began jotting down
outrageous weather sayings ``just for kicks'' about 20 years ago.
He spins the best of the 50 or 60 weather windies in his repertoire
at speaking engagements around the region.
   ``When you're from the hills and you're out in the flatlands,
the natives like to pull your leg a little bit,'' he said. ``People
always exaggerate about the weather.''
   Pfister's found that to be especially true in the Midwest.
   ``It seems as if everybody in the Midwest likes to think that
their weather is unique,'' he said. ``I suppose it is, in a way. I
don't think people on the East and West coasts need to worry as
much about tornadoes as they do in the Midwest.''
   Talking about the weather is ``always a good way to jump-start a
conversation,'' Pfister said.
   ``I'm not sure why people like to talk about the weather,'' he
said. ``Maybe it's a neutral subject. You're not going to offend
anyone if you talk about the weather. You're not going to seem nosy
or anything.''
   Pfister says he enjoys playing the straight man for old-timers,
gas station attendants, store clerks or anyone else who can add to
his collection of weather windies.
   An Arkansan transplanted in Texas once told Pfister that
comfortable summer days in Dallas are as rare as rocking-horse
manure.
   ``I love that one,'' he said.
   The same Nebraskan who told Pfister the story about feeding ice
to chickens complained that rivers had gotten so dry catfish were
coming up to homes to beg a drink of water.
   A North Dakota native claimed it gets so cold in his state in
winter that words freeze in people's mouths and they have to wait
until spring to find out what everyone's been talking about.
   An Oklahoman swears that the wind blows so hard in the Sooner
state that there was a calm day once and everyone fell down.
   And South Dakotans and Minnesotans alike gripe that their states
have nine months of winter and three months of bad sledding.
   ``All these sayings don't do you any good, but they're kind of
nice things to know at parties,'' Pfister quipped.

   Before she died in January, Dorothea Allen
destroyed family papers and letters and tore the date and place of
birth from her passport. She left more than $2.8 million in cash,
no traceable next of kin, no will, no birth certificate, no
marriage certificate, and a growing list of claimants to her
fortune.
   So far, 31 people have come forward, claiming to be heirs of the
woman known in British newspapers as ``the vanishing lady.''
   By law, claimants have 12 years to prove they are blood
relatives. If they fail, the fortune goes to the state treasury.
   Treasury lawyers ordered the sale of her effects, including mink
coats, a 1972 Rolls-Royce Corniche and a 1964 Daimler, jewelry,
paintings, furniture, silver and other trappings from a glamorous
past that by some accounts included a trip across the dance floor
with Fred Astaire.
   The sale, conducted Tuesday by Sotheby's at her 300-year-old
home, added $1.08 million cash to the estate. The home itself, in
the village of Sutton-under-Brailes 90 miles northwest of London,
is expected to fetch another $1.3 million when it is sold.
   According to Sotheby's, the latest claimant to come forward is
Wilfried Kluber from Baden-Baden, West Germany, who says his
grandmother was Mrs. Allen's sister.
   Kluber told Sotheby's that his grandmother's maiden name was
Farquharson, and that Mrs. Allen was born in 1901. His letter has
been passed along to the treasury, Sotheby's said.
   The Times of London said another claimant is Merilyn Horton of
Cleveland, Ohio. It reported that Mrs. Horton says her
great-grandfather was a Scottish immigrant named Farquharson.
   Chris Proudlove of Sotheby's said that after a crash in her
chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce in the early 1980s, Mrs. Allen became
a recluse in her home, Sutton Brailes Manor.
   Her husband, Eric Allen, died in 1965. News reports said the
fortune came from a corset factory they set up in 1927 in nearby
Banbury.
   ``She deliberately tried to obliterate her past... I think she
was of lowly birth, married into money but had a business head on
her shoulders. I think she wanted to be remembered as the rich lady
of the manor,'' Proudlove said.
   The Times said other reported theories were that she was a
half-Belgian ex-nun, an American cabaret dancer or even Allen's
sister. But The Independent said former employees and neighbors
scoffed at rumors of an incestuous marriage.
   The Times quoted John Lee of the treasury lawyers' office as
saying: ``So far we only have a passport indicating a maiden name
of Farquharson, but the details of date and place of birth have
been destroyed.''
   Hoping to solve the mystery, Sotheby's on Aug. 24 organized a
tea party on the lawn at Sutton Brailes Manor for former staff.
   ``She destroyed her past so successfully I don't think anybody
will ever discover the real truth,'' said Leslie Stratford, 82, who
was her accountant.
   Muriel Keyte, 73, who was also at the tea party, said Tuesday
that she was Allen's only child by his first marriage. She believed
his second marriage, to Dorothea, was bigamous.
   The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday quoted unidentified former
employees as saying Mrs. Allen was a factory worker who eloped with
Allen after he abandoned his wife and children.
   News reports said that in the 1930s, the couple enjoyed a
champagne lifestyle, with luxury apartments in London, a beachfront
estate in Barbados as well as Sutton Brailes Manor.
   Among the stories of their past _ none of them verified _ were
tales of her dancing with Astaire on one of the couple's frequent
visits to Paris.
   In her old age, servants recalled, she used to call for a cup of
tea by setting off the burglar alarm.

<HEAD>U.S. Corporate Chiefs to Help Soviets With Fundamentals</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 15 chiefs of U.S. corporations going to
the Soviet Union this weekend with Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher plan to offer American know-how on such fundamental items
as efficient housing and transporting goods.
   ``It's kind of back to the basics ... You walk up a stairway in
a Soviet building and none of the steps are the same. They can't
even finish a floor flat, things you and I take for granted,'' said
Mark Hungerford, chairman and chief executive officer of Tanscisco
Industries Inc. of San Francisco, a rail car company.
   ``They can get rockets to the moon, so it's not like they're
incapable, but they've never focused on these things before,''
Hungerford said.
   He is one of 15 chief executive officers of U.S. companies
scheduled to leave for Moscow on Saturday for a week-long visit to
discuss what kind of ``technical assistance'' the United States can
give the Soviet Union.
   Mosbacher and the business leaders are set to leave on the eve
of President Bush's summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. The administration said Wednesday that it would take a
fresh look at economic aid for the Soviet Union in light of
Moscow's ``real and very helpful support'' in the Persian Gulf.
   At the economic summit of industrial nations in Houston last
July, the administration balked at providing the Soviet Union with
cash grants or loans but agreed to provide the technical assistance.
   About 80 other nations receive American technical assistance,
which can range from developing a fly-resistant wheat in Morocco to
bringing down Bangladesh's fertility rate.
   The Soviets need help with improving their transportation
systems and housing, said business leaders who will make the trip.
Several officers of U.S. oil companies are also accompanying
Mosbacher.
   ``Big chunks of money are not what they want. They want to have
the exposure to the management techniques and construction
techniques and operating techniques that we take for granted,''
Hungerford said.
   Hungerford's company, for example, is engaged in a joint venture
with the Soviets to help them with a heating system for tank rail
cars that performs well in cold climates. His firm also is helping
the Soviets improve their transportation of petrochemical products.
   Another transportation company, Sea-Land Service Inc., of
Edison, N.J. _ will be represented by its chief executive, Alex J.
Mandl. Sea-Land specializes in ``global distribution networks.''
   Mandl said the trip gives him a chance to help both Bush and his
company.
   ``That part of the world is opening up. As long as the Iron
Curtain was up, our distribution network did not participate in
that part of the world. As that wall comes down, we have a chance
to be in there,'' Mandl said.
   Leonard Sylk, chairman and chief executive officer of Shelter
Systems Group of Hainesport, N.J., said the Soviets have been
interested in his firm's expertise because it makes manufactured
housing components. They are the roofs, floors and walls that
large-scale builders use in putting up houses.
   The Soviets have voiced interest in using wood for housing, as
in the United States, rather than the concrete and cinder blocks
now used, Sylk said.
   U.S. businesses stand to gain if the Soviet economy improves,
the executives said.
   ``It's in our interest as a nation to help them at least get
into the last part of the 20th century. They say to make peace is
to make prosperity, and vice versa,'' Hungerford said.
   Other companies to be represented on the trip are, according to
government sources, are:
   Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill.; Atlantic Richfield
Co. of Los Angeles; Chevron Corp., of San Francisco; Dresser
Industries of Dallas; Fortune Magazine of New York; Glenair
International of Del Mar, Calif.
   Also, the Louisiana Land and Exploration Co. of New Orleans;
PaineWebber of New York; Pepsico Inc. of Purchase, N.Y.; Pruet Oil
Co., of El Dorado, Ark.; Texaco Inc., of White Plains N.Y.; and
United Telecommunications of Westwood, Kan.

   Forthright, steely and calm, Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd is playing the central role in Britain's involvement
in the Persian Gulf crisis like an old hand.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who appointed Hurd less than a
year ago, has been content for the most part to let him speak for
the government _ a role she had usually reserved for herself.
   Appearing daily on British television newscasts, Hurd turns up
in capitals from London to Riyadh, stylishly berating Saddam
Hussein, talking of giving sanctions a chance while preparing for
war, and prodding Iraq to release Western hostages.
   ``This is a cat-and-mouse game _ now a little mercy, now some
more ruthlessness,'' Hurd said after the Iraqi president, tousling
the hair of a 5-year-old British hostage, said he would let women
and children go. ``And of course it's quite unacceptable.''
   Hurd, 60, began his working life as a diplomat, then turned to
politics and writing. He is probably the first British foreign
secretary whose qualifications include fluency in Mandarin Chinese.
   Hurd was appointed in October, just three months after the
humiliation of having his previous post as home secretary offered
to others in a Cabinet shuffle.
   Hurd appeared a safe choice for the Foreign Office post. For
him, it was the fulfillment of an ambition cherished through a long
political career.
   Some analysts predicted trouble between the patrician-sounding
Hurd and Mrs. Thatcher, who is traditionally suspicious of the
Foreign Office with its upper-crust style and its instincts for
compromise and conciliation.
   But for the first time since she led the Conservative Party back
to power in 1979, Mrs. Thatcher is letting someone else is do most
of the talking in a crisis.
   Commented the pro-conservative Daily Telegraph: ``Hurd simply
conveys a strong sense of unvarnished quality which avoids slipping
over into dullness.''
   Hurd is an old-fashioned Tory from the paternalistic, benign,
center-left wing of the party that Mrs. Thatcher overthrew in 1975.
   The son and grandson of Conservative members of Parliament, Hurd
was educated at Eton and Cambridge, where he took a first-class
honors degree in history. He joined the diplomatic service in 1952.
   While posted in Rome, he wrote the first of five published
thrillers.
   At the age of 36, Hurd quit a fast-moving diplomatic career for
politics. For six years he was political secretary to Edward Heath,
the man Mrs. Thatcher ousted as party leader in 1975.
   Mrs. Thatcher gave him his first Cabinet job, as Northern
Ireland Secretary, a decade later.
   As foreign secretary, Hurd appears to have succeeded in locking
Mrs. Thatcher into a commitment to link the pound to other European
currencies and to have generally oiled Britain's often prickly
relations with the rest of the European Community.
   Only five years younger than Mrs. Thatcher, Hurd seemed to have
reached his political zenith before the gulf crisis.
   He has talked of spending more time with his wife, Judith, his
former secretary whom he married after a 1982 divorce, and their
two small children. There are three adults sons by the first
marriage.
   His name is also mentioned as a serious contender to succeed
Mrs. Thatcher.
   The speculation does not hurt a politician who, unlike some of
Mrs. Thatcher's prominent aides, manages to be loyal without
appearing cowed.
   ``She likes an argument,'' Hurd said recently of Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``Some people find it difficult to argue with a woman prime
minister, so they rather tend to shrivel up and feel resentful. The
answer is actually to argue back. You'll find yourself being
contradicted and sometimes told you don't know what you are talking
about. But if you persevere .. you gain ground.''

<HEAD>Diplomats: Iraq Can Survive Sanctions for One Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.N. sanctions enforced by American
warships are chipping away at Iraq's war-hardened economy, but some
Western analysts fear it could take a year to force any real
concessions.
   Time could be an ally for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who is
constantly probing for weak links that will enable him to break the
embargo and the international solidarity behind it.
   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, are
beginning to bite in Baghdad, however. Iraq now rations some basic
foods. There are shortages and growing bread lines, some with
hundreds of people waiting more than four hours.
   Western diplomats say Iraq can survive for months and perhaps
indefinitely on its own food stockpiles and production from this
year's expected bumber crop yields.
   ``The embargo on food is wishful thinking on the part of the
West,'' said one diplomat, who like others spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Iraqis, he said, are resilient people, pragmatic and
accustomed to hardships after eight years of war with Iran.
   ``They could effectively feed themselves on a basic level
indefinitely,'' the senior diplomat said.
   Another Western diplomat agreed, saying Iraq has enough food to
``comfortably survive for three months, perhaps more.''
   The real bite of sanctions, they say, will be felt in the
high-tech industry and infrastructure of this nation, which has
relied on Western technology and expertise.
   ``It's hard to see how all these industrial items they are used
to can get in,'' the senior diplomat said. ``One can imagine the
whole 20th century economy of this place is collapsing or about to
collapse.''
   Iraq relies on imports, spare parts and components no longer
available because of the sanctions.
   One European diplomat noted some areas have experienced brief
power cuts, perhaps a sign of some technical problems in Iraqi
generating capacity.
   ``The state-controlled media has advised people to conserve
fuel. We take that as evidence of official worry about how the
refineries are holding out,'' he said.
   Still, diplomats predict the embargo will take months to cripple
the country.
   ``It may be a year before it hurts Saddam Hussein enough to make
concessions,'' said one.
   Some Western diplomats also fear that Saddam will persuade poor,
weaker countries to abandon the sanctions.
   ``He has been successful,'' a diplomat said. ``There are certain
countries that are weaker, that cannot resist the situation ... the
blackmail, the hostages, the promises of future deals.'' He refused
to identify the countries.
   The diplomats said the level of the sanctions-busting is
insignificant so far, and that the economic blockade will be
effective if maintained.
   ``Export sanctions are very effective. I can't imagine them
flying out planeloads of crude oil,'' the senior diplomat said.
``Iraq's creditworthiness is near zero. The money is running out.''
   Private contractors said they have shut down or mothballed
projects in Iraq and that many companies may be reluctant to come
back. Some of their workers have been detained by the Iraqis for
violating their contracts.
   Many foreign workers who perform menial tasks also have fled,
and piles of garbage now litter some neighborhoods. One Iraqi said
it was an unusual sight, caused by the exodus of Egyptian workers.
   Some Iraqis say they believe shortages caused by the sanctions,
especially food lines, could lead to street violence.
   But diplomats here discount any hope that Saddam will be toppled
by a popular revolt.
   ``Opposition is just wishful thinking,'' one said. ``There is no
opposition in Iraq.''
   Saddam's portrait smiles down from buildings and billboards all
over the city. His name is attached to everything from monuments to
the airport.
   Dissent is crushed ruthlessly, and the state-controlled media
hails the achievements of the president, portraying him as the
leader of the Arab masses who has defied the superpowers.
   ``The propaganda machine works perfectly in this country,'' said
one Western diplomat. ``It is like the Soviet Union under Stalin in
the 1930s, the people genuinely believe the propaganda.''
   ``They believe it in their hearts,'' said another.
   Saddam, they argue, is strong, firmly in control and enjoying
the genuine support of at least half the population.
   While desperately seeking for ways to break the sanctions,
government ministries are working overtime looking for ways to
increase production of essentials.
   The government is making loans to farmers and providing
fertilizer free of charge, one diplomat said.
   It has instituted rationing, one said, to play up the dramatic
effects of the embargo as well as to conserve food and to guarantee
a constant if reduced flow of some foods.
   ``Rationing appeals to the soft hearts of other countries,'' the
diplomat said.
   But the senior diplomat noted the U.N. sanctions permit the
delivery of food and medicine when necessary, and he doubted they
would become the biggest weapons of the embargo.
   ``When people start dying who will deny them food or medicine?
Will President Bush be able to deny it to a dying child?'' he asked.

   The private relief agency AmeriCares says
it's sending food, water and medicine to refugees stranded in
Jordan.
   In Washington, the American Red Cross reports it is stepping up
its relief efforts in Jordan, Egypt and other countries trying to
cope with exodus of people fleeing Iraq and Kuwait.
   Besides chartered flights carrying food and supplies, the
American Red Cross has donated $75,000 to the International Red
Cross to use in relief activities in Jordan and Egypt, officials
said Wednesday.
   The Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore said it has donated
$25,000 to buy tents for the thousand of evacuees stranded in
Jordan.
   The first AmeriCares airlift, scheduled for Saturday, will take
75,000 pounds of supplies to Jordan, where hundreds of thousands of
Asians fleeing Iraq and Kuwait have crowded desert camps with no
food, water or money, said Steve Norman, spokesman for AmeriCares.
Temperatures soar during daytime and plunge after dark.
   Airlifts will continue as long as necessary, Norman said. The
New Canaan-based agency also might help fly the refugees home.
   ``We are not normally people-ferriers,'' he said. ``But if we
can arrange for access to help people get out and if people think
it's appropriate, I think we might extend our relief effort in that
area as well.''
   Asian refugees were pouring into Jordan at a rate of 10,000 a
day, relief officials said Tuesday, adding the number could reach 1
million within a week or two. More than 420,000 refugees have
traveled to Jordan since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, causing
a massive strain on Jordan's social services.
   In Egypt, the Red Cross estimated 161,000 people had arrived by
Monday.
   On Tuesday, fights broke out in one Jordan camp as Jordanian
troops tried to distribute food rations of one piece of flat Arab
bread, one tomato and one cucumber per person, AmeriCares said.
   The organization would send non-perishable food such as wafers,
nutrition bars, and ``survival-type'' packaged food, Norman said.
   The Red Cross said over-crowding of refugees was a major concern.
   ``The International Red Cross has been working in Jordan for the
past two weeks, and according to relief workers, the conditions for
the new arrivals are deteriorating,'' said Steve Richards,
executive vice president of the American Red Cross. ``It is urgent
that the refugees be evacuated away from the border area as soon as
possible.''
   The organization said some refugees have had little water, food
and shelter for periods of up to three days. The Red Cross
chartered planes to fly into Amman, Jordan, carrying milk,
babyfood, food for adults, family-size tents and other survival
items.
   A flight later this week will bring the total of aid provided by
the International Red Cross to Jordanian Red Crescent refugee
relief programs to 350 tons, officials said.
   On Tuesday, Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan criticized the
international community for not doing enough.
   ``I don't think we had any idea of how we would do it without
the cooperation of the Jordanians, and I think until recently ...
they really weren't communicating with anyone,'' Norman said.
   The international aid group Operation USA appealed Wednesday for
money and bulk donations of food, medicine and shelters for the
refugees, citizens of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, the
Philippines and Thailand.
   The effort by Los Angeles-based Operation USA came as the United
Nations requested international help for the foreigners who have
fled to Jordan.
   InterAction, an independent coalition of private, voluntary
agencies which provide humanitarian assistance abroad, had several
member agencies that were accepting donations of cash for the
refugees.
   The agencies include: American Red Cross, AmeriCares Foundation,
Church World Service, Direct Relief International, Lutheran World
Relief, Operation USA, Save The Children, World Concern, World
Relief, and World Vision.

<HEAD>Pontiff Calls For Compassion for Africa's AIDS Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, visiting a region
ravaged by AIDS, has declared that the disease is a moral issue
that calls for changes in sexual behavior.
   The pope, who traveled to this tiny mountainous country on the
fifth day of a 10-day African trip, said AIDS is a pandemic which
must not be treated solely as a medical problem. He stressed its
``implications of a moral and anthropological character.''
   ``The epidemic differs from so many others that humanity has
known in that specific human behavior plays a role in its spread,''
John Paul said in the speech Wednesday to Burundi's bishops. ``It
is linked, directly or not, to the transmission of life and love.''
   The first big landmark on the pope's drive from the airport to
the city was a 90-foot-wide sign warning against the dangers of
AIDS spread by permissive sex in polygamous African societies.
   ``The Burundi society, like many others in the world, is exposed
to a grave danger,'' the pope said. ``I am talking about the
pandemic of AIDS which afflicts a number of your compatriots,
especially young adults, and it is painful to state it, little
children.''
   John Paul said AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
poses major challenges for the church, such as informing and
educating people about the disease while making sure the problem
``is not treated at the expense of the (moral) ethic.''
   He said the church has a duty to assist AIDS sufferers, not only
with health care but with ``psychological and spiritual
assistance'' for those with an acute form of the illness and those
who carry the virus.
   ``These people often tend to close themselves in an anguished
silence,'' he said. ``They need a fraternal presence to give them
the courage to accept their condition.''
   It was the second time the pope has spoken about the deadly
disease during his four-nation African tour. In Tanzania last week,
he called for a global effort to combat the disease and reaffirmed
the church's rejection of the use of condoms as a means to check
the spread of AIDS.
   The World Health Organization estimates that 5 million Africans
are infected with the virus that can cause AIDS.
   AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. The virus
attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a
wide variety of infections and cancers.
   John Paul began his three-day visit to Burundi by urging
forgiveness and reconciliation in this country with a long history
of tribal warfare. He flew to the country on Wednesday from
Tanzania.
   The pope, on his seventh visit to Africa, will also travel to to
Rwanda and the Ivory Coast, where he will end his tour Monday by
consecrating the massive basilica of Our Lady of Peace.

   White House and congressional budget
negotiators have agreed on almost nothing during three contentious
months of bargaining. And now that they are about to resume
discussions, Saddam Hussein has made the job even harder.
   Iraq's conquest of oil-rich Kuwait has meant higher fuel costs,
and that has threatened to further slow the already sputtering U.S.
economy. Dispatching American troops to Saudi Arabia has driven up
Pentagon spending.
   Those changed economic and political circumstances will
complicate efforts to shrink the federal deficit when
administration officials and congressional leaders resume budget
talks on Friday.
   In preparation, House Democrats and Republicans held separate
budget sessions Wednesday and planned additional sessions today.
   ``We're working on a Democratic plan,'' House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., tersely told reporters when he emerged
from a lengthy afternoon session.
   White House budget director Richard Darman met with Republican
lawmakers, meantime. Darman said little about that meeting but
expressed concern that the red-ink problem will be further
complicated by the costs of the Persian Gulf operation and the
slowing U.S. economy.
   The budget talks broke off five weeks ago for Congress' August
recess.
   ``The world we left Aug. 4 is not the same as the world we'll
see on Sept. 7,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., one of the
negotiators.
   Yet the bargainers have precious little time left to work out a
budget deal. The new fiscal year starts Oct. 1. Unless a pact is
enacted, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will trigger more
than $100 billion in spending cuts to most federal programs _ a
staggering amount _ that day.
   With that in mind, the negotiators' goal is to work out a
package of tax increases and spending cuts by Monday. Their
sessions _ at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland _ may be
so lengthy that bargainers say they may sleep overnight at the base
to give themselves more working time.
   ``Sometimes the will for a solution comes collectively when you
know you're down to the short strokes,'' said another participant,
Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.
   Before the talks recessed, bargainers had reached a consensus on
one thing: the need for a package that saves about $50 billion next
year and $500 billion over five years.
   Now, negotiators disagree over how much savings are desirable.
It is possible they will settle for a smaller plan, particularly
for next year.
   Some lawmakers say they want to stick to the initial $50
billion-$500 billion formula. They argue that with a limp economy,
there is more reason than ever to take a substantial whack at the
budget gap, which could be a record $230 billion or more next year
unless something is done.
   ``We have to make a decision about whether a deficit-reduction
package is important to this country,'' said House Budget Committee
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``I still think it is.''
   Others say reductions in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion
may be preferable for next year because the weak economy shouldn't
be shocked by even deeper cuts.
   ``You don't need a Ph.D. in economics to figure out if you have
slow economic growth and you cut $50 billion out of the economy at
that point, what you do is go right into the hole you've been
slipping into,'' said William Gray of Pennsylvania, the
third-ranking House Democrat.
   Administration officials said as recently as Tuesday that they
still think $50 billion in savings is the best goal for next year,
although they are willing to listen to proposals for smaller
targets.
   Lawmakers who have spoken to White House aides say that could
drop to perhaps $35 billion.
   The Iraqi invasion has also caused bargainers to look
differently at some likely components of a deficit-cutting package.
   Higher oil prices will make it harder for the negotiators to
agree to new energy taxes, which before August seemed a likely part
of any compromise.
   The showdown in the gulf has also provided new ammunition to
opponents of deep defense cuts. Some Republicans say the
confrontation with Iraq shows that the military must remain strong,
despite the waning of the Cold War.
   Democrats, who have been looking for Pentagon reductions in the
$9 billion to $16 billion range, counter that any additional
defense spending needed in the Middle East can be more than
compensated for by cuts in U.S. military expenditures in Europe.
   Despite their divisions, bargainers say they are guardedly
optimistic that they will make a deal.
   ``With the combination of the military and economic crisis and
the budget crisis and the sequester (Gramm-Rudman spending cuts),
the members of this summit are going to feel they can't just walk
out _ I hope,'' said Panetta.

   Here are the questions about sexual knowledge
asked in a new national survey designed by the Kinsey Institute.
   The questions were multiple choice or true-false. They are
followed by the correct answer.
   1. Nowadays, what do you think is the age at which the average
or typical American first has sexual intercourse? Answer: 16 or 17.
   2. Out of every 10 married American men, how many would you
estimate have had an extramarital afair _ that is, have been
sexually unfaithful to their wives? Answer: three or four.
   3. Out of every 10 American women, how many would you estimate
have had anal (rectal) intercourse? Answer: three or four.
   4. A person can get AIDS by having anal (rectal) intercourse
even if neither partner is infected with the AIDS virus. Answer:
False.
   5. There are over-the-counter spermicides people can buy at the
drugstore that will kill the AIDS virus. Answer: True.
   6. Petroleum jelly, Vaseline Intensive Care, baby oil and Nivea
are not good lubricants to use with a condom or diaphragm. Answer:
True.
   7. More than one out of four (25 percent) of American men have
had a sexual experience with another male during either their teens
or adult years. Answer: True.
   8. It is usually difficult to tell whether people are or are not
homosexual just by their appearance or gestures. Answer: True.
   9. A woman or teen-age girl can get pregnant during her
menstrual flow (her ``period''). Answer: True.
   10. A woman or teen-age girl can get pregnant even if the man
withdraws his penis before he ejaculates (before he ``comes.'')
Answer: True.
   11. Unless they are having sex, women do not need to have
regular gynecological examinations. Answer: False.
   12. Teen-age boys should examine their testicles (``balls'')
regularly just as women self-examine their breasts for lumps.
Answer: True.
   13. Problems with erections are most often started by a physical
problem. Answer: True.
   14. Almost all erection problems can be successfully treated.
Answer: True.
   15. Menopause, or change of life as it is often called, does not
cause most women to lose interest in having sex. Answer: True.
   16. Out of every 10 American women, how many would you estimate
have masturbated either as children or after they were grown up?
Answer: Six to eight.
   17. What do you think is the average length of a man's erect
penis? Answer: Five to seven inches.
   18. Most women prefer a sexual partner with a
larger-than-average penis. Answer: False.
   Note: Score one point for every correct answer. Any answer
earned a point on question 5 because some people may have
misinterpreted it, the poll report said.
   People scoring 16 or better get an ``A,'' 14 or 15 a ``B,'' 12
or 13 a ``C,'' 10 or 11 a ``D,'' and fewer points an ``F,''
according to the poll.

<HEAD>Little-Known Rescuer of Hungarian Jews is Honored 45 Years Later</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An elderly Italian man is being plucked from
45 years of obscurity to be toasted at a black-tie dinner as an
unsung World War II hero who rescued thousands of Hungarian Jews
from death in the Holocaust.
   Unlike Raoul Wallenberg, the celebrated Swedish diplomat who
saved tens of thousands of Jews in wartime Budapest, retired
businessman Giorgio Perlasca and his perilous exploits were
virtually unknown in the United States until very recently.
   Tonight, all that will change. Hundreds of Italian-Americans
will gather to watch Perlasca, 80, receive the Medal of Remembrance
from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council. The council, a federal
agency, is overseeing construction of a privately financed, $147
million Holocaust museum near the National Mall.
   Perlasca, who made his first trip to the United States from his
modest home in Padua, Italy, for the occasion, will receive the
medal from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
   He is the first recipient of the award, established to honor
individuals who displayed extraordinary heroism and acts of courage
during the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were slaughtered by
Nazi Germany.
   ``In this sea of darkness, there were flickers of light from a
few people,'' said Miles Lerman, the council's chairman for
international relations, who learned of Perlasca during a visit to
Budapest last year.
   ``There weren't many who cared to step forward while other good
people stood idly by and did nothing,'' Lerman said. ``But their
choices made the difference between life and death. In the total
darkness of cruelty and indifference, they found that goodness has
a power of its own, and they became beacons of light who redeemed
mankind.''
   Perlasca, who dislikes publicity and dismisses any mention of
his personal heroism, speaks modestly of his wartime mission of
mercy. Others would have done the same, he said.
   ``I always say, the opportunity makes a thief,'' Perlasca said,
speaking through an interpreter. ``My opportunity was there, and I
took it. Maybe those who remained silent didn't have the
opportunity.''
   During the three months from October 1944 until Soviet troops
liberated Budapest in January 1945, Perlasca masqueraded as a
Spanish diplomat and arranged safe haven for an estimated 5,200
Jews who had been given phony ``letters of protection'' by the
Spanish legation in the Hungarian capital.
   Some experts say Perlasca was responsible for saving more than
10,000 Jews, most of them women, children and the elderly, from
certain death by Hungarian Nazi thugs until Soviet liberators
arrived.
   Perlasca was the Budapest representative of an import-export
company in Rome that supplied meat to the Italian army. When
dictator Benito Mussolini was overthrown in 1943 and Italy
abandoned its alliance with Nazi Germany, Perlasca sought
protection from reprisals by obtaining a diplomatic passport from
the Spanish legation.
   The Spanish were friendly to Perlasca because he had fought with
Francisco Franco's forces in the Spanish civil war. Later, when the
Spanish minister fled to Switzerland, Perlasca convinced Hungarian
officials that he was the legal representative of Spain in Budapest.
   Perlasca, then 34, was appalled at the sight of Jews being shot,
beaten and herded aboard cattle cars at the Budapest train station
for deportation to German death camps.
   ``So much agony reinforced in me the will to do as much as
possible to help those unfortunate people,'' he later told a
Hungarian writer. ``The cattle loaded by my company ... were
treated better than the deportees.''
   Repeatedly, Perlasca harangued senior Hungarian officials to
assure the safety of Jews crowded into the sanctuary of apartment
houses flying the Spanish flag, and personally rescued Jews who had
been arrested in violation of agreements.
   He spent his dwindling funds to buy scraps of meat, powdered
eggs and other scarce foods, and delivered them to the starving
inhabitants of his ``safe houses'' in the Spanish diplomat's black
limousine.
   Perlasca vividly recalled snatching twin children from a throng
of Jewish deportees at the Budapest train station and hustling them
to safety in the Spanish limousine. ``I thought to myself, why do
these two have to go to die?'' he said.
   When a Gestapo major tried to pull the children from the car at
gunpoint, Perlasca physically barred him at the door, claiming
diplomatic immunity. The confrontation escalated, with Perlasca's
friend Wallenberg joining the argument along with representatives
of other neutral countries, the Vatican and the International Red
Cross.
   A German colonel intervened. The major explained the situation.
``Let them go. Their time will come, too,'' the colonel said. The
Germans walked away, and Perlasca kept the twins.
   Perlasca asked Wallenberg who the colonel was. Wallenberg,
surprised, replied that he was Adolf Eichmann.
   Eichmann, the Nazi engineer of the Holocaust, was captured by
Israeli agents in 1960 and convicted by a Jerusalem court of crimes
against humanity. He was hanged in 1962.
   ``His time came, too,'' Perlasca said.

<HEAD>Past Conscientious Objector Status Causes Problems For Lawmaker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STUCKEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than a year, Republicans looked
forward eagerly to taking on Rep. Roy Dyson in the November general
election.
   Now they are not so sure that the Maryland Democrat will make it
that far.
   A recent revelation that the hawkish congressman was a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam war has leaders of both
political parties speculating that he might not survive the primary
election next Tuesday.
   Dyson is still seen as the favorite. But for the first time,
there is talk among political leaders in the 1st District that
state legislator Barbara Kreamer, his chief Democratic opponent,
has an outside chance of winning.
   ``If she has any money to make a major blitz on television this
weekend, it's going to be a lot closer than anyone thought,'' said
Joyce Terhes, state Republican chairwoman.
   A top Democratic official who asked not to be named said the
furor over Dyson's draft status and Kreamer's pro-choice views on
abortion give her an outside chance of pulling off an upset.
   ``The problem for the Democratic Party is if Dyson wins now, he
loses in November,'' said the party leader, who considers Kreamer a
stronger candidate.
   Not all Democrats are that pessimistic. There is agreement,
however, that Republicans have a good chance of reclaiming the seat
they lost to Dyson in 1980.
   The incumbent's problems extend beyond his draft status.
   They began in 1988 with the disclosures that the Federal
Election Commission was investigating contributions made to him and
other members of Congress by defense lobbyists.
   Joseph E. Hill, a consultant for Unisys Corp., later pleaded
guilty to donating Unisys money to Dyson and other officials and
disguising the contributions as personal donations. Dyson said he
did not know the gifts came from corporate funds.
   Just before the May primary election in 1988, Dyson's campaign
was rocked again by the suicide of his top aide, Tom Pappas. Pappas
jumped to his death from a New York hotel the day The Washington
Post reported that he recruited single young men for the
congressman's staff and demanded that they spend off hours
socializing with him and other staff members.
   The National Republican Congressional Committee targeted Dyson
for defeat this year. The committee said its polls indicate he is
one of the most vulnerable members of Congress seeking re-election.
   That vulnerability enticed eight Republicans and three other
Democrats to enter the 1st District race this year.
   Just as it appeared Dyson had put his problems behind him, the
story broke about his draft status.
   He disclosed in a news release last week that he had been a
conscientious objector. The release was issued the day after The
Washington Post sought an interview to discuss his draft records.
   ``I opposed the war in Vietnam,'' Dyson said by way of
explanation.
   ``I was a conscientious objector because I believed it was wrong
to draft young men and send them to die in the jungles of Southeast
Asia.''
   As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Dyson is a
strong supporter of Pentagon budget requests.
   He backed the Panama invasion and thinks U.S. troops should be
used to fight drug wars in South America.
   After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Dyson said President Bush
should ``preposition troops right in the middle of downtown
Baghdad.''
   His hawkish stand on defense coupled with his conscientious
objector status brought charges of hypocrisy from his opponents.
   ``He obviously is a hypocrite in this matter, hiding from the
draft ... and at the same time urging that we position our boys in
the streets of Baghdad,'' said Mark Frazer, one of his Republican
opponents.
   The disclosure provided an instant boost to Kreamer's campaign.
   ``There's definitely been a sea change in the last week,'' said
Bob DeWeese, Kreamer's campaign manager.
   ``Checks are coming in that we didn't expect to get. That's
going to help us get the message out on television and the radio,''
he said.
   No single favorite has emerged from the crowded Republican field.
   Seven of the eight candidates are campaigning actively for the
15,000 to 20,000 votes likely to be cast in the Republican primary.
   One of them, state Delegate Richard Colburn, believes Kreamer
would be an easier target in the mostly conservative 1st District.
   ``With Roy, it would be conservative vs. conservative in
November. With Barbara, you would have a liberal Democrat running
against a conservative Republican,'' Colburn said.

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS TAYLOR IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The USS Taylor was
tracing its usual box-pattern patrol course in the central Persian
Gulf when the tanker, heavily laden and low in the water, appeared
on the horizon, outbound.
   ``This is an American warship. Please identify yourself, your
cargo and port of origin,'' came the radio challenge.
   A voice identified the tanker as the Greek-registered
Fortuneship L, carrying oil from Jubail, Saudi Arabia.
   ``Thank you,'' said the Taylor, wishing a good day to the
battered vessel that once survived three Iraqi rocket attacks _
Aug. 30, Nov. 11 and Nov. 12, 1987 _ while under charter to Iran
during its war with Iraq.
   After two sister frigates, USS Reid and USS Robert G. Bradley,
fired warning shots at a pair of Iraqi tankers on Aug. 18, the
Taylor was involved in shadowing one of the tankers out of the gulf.
   Otherwise, in a month of operating mainly in the central gulf,
the Charleston, S.C.-based missile frigate has yet to encounter its
first Iraqi tanker or cargo vessel.
   ``We have been talking with every ship that comes through our
section. Every single one has been cooperative and polite,'' said
the Taylor's skipper, Cmdr. Kevin P. Green of Summerville, S.C.
   The 3,900-ton Taylor is one of 11 U.S. warships operating in the
gulf, helping to enforce the U.N.-ordered economic blockade of
Baghdad.
   Having arrived in July for a three-month tour with the Middle
East Force, the Navy's gulf-based patrol unit, it was already on
station when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We were on a routine deployment. All the excitement developed
after we were here,'' said Green. Even so, he said, the Iraqi
invasion ``really changed very little'' for his crew.
   In training exercises, said Green, ``we go through just about
every conceivable contingency, practice with all the weapons
systems and are prepared for precisely this type of situation.''
   The Taylor's patrol assignment makes it one of the first U.S.
warships that would encounter Iraqi tankers or other vessels headed
south from Iraq or Kuwait, Green said.
   It also means ships coming up the gulf have usually already been
cleared by other ships before they reach the Taylor's area.
   ``Iraq is convinced that we mean what we say,'' Green said. ``I
am sure they're convinced we know what we're doing out here.''
   Although the Taylor is at ``Readiness Condition Three,'' one
notch below ``Battle Stations,'' the atmosphere is relaxed. Sailors
jog and work out with weights on the upper deck.
   Lt. Steve Davis, the Taylor's combat systems officer,
acknowledged the relative comfort the ship's crew members enjoy
when compared to the U.S. troops who have taken up positions in the
Saudi desert.
   ``I really feel sympathy for those guys out there in the sand.
At least we can duck inside, cool off and have a good meal,'' he
said.
   Like other U.S. warships, the Taylor now has a small contingent
of U.S. Coast Guardsmen, veterans of the U.S. government's
Caribbean drug interdiction program, to assist in enforcing the
U.N.-sanctioned Iraqi blockade.
   Each boarding party includes eight or more members, both sailors
and Coast Guardsmen.

<HEAD>Exhausted Airmen In `Uproar' Over Possibilty of Pay Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DRAGON BASE CAMP, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The talk from the
exhausted group huddled under the F-15 turned quickly from the
intricacies of jet engines to worries about financial support for
their wives and children back home.
   The U.S. government may cut the supplemental income soldiers
received back home for living off-base because they now get their
food and supplies free in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I just had a kid four weeks ago and that money is figured into
my finances,'' Chris Jessen tells a visitor to an F-15 maintenance
hanger on Wednesday, where the airmen work 12-hour shifts in
sweltering heat.
   ``If they take it away, then in essence the government is
saying, `Sergeant you're going to pay us this money so that you can
go to Saudi Arabia and support the mission,'' he said.
   Jessen's buddies huddled under the F-15 nod their heads in
agreement; all but one of the five is married, the four that are
all have children. One found out the other day his wife is pregnant
with their fourth child.
   ``As far as morale, that's the biggest problem,'' Kevin Wilde,
of Sioux City, Iowa, said of the possible loss of the pay known as
BAS _ Basic Allowance for Subsistence. For these men, it amounts to
an extra $180 a month _ about 20 percent of their total pay.
   Their commanding officer interjects, saying that for now the Air
Force's Tactical Air Command has kept up the payments, but that
Congress will have to act to keep the money flowing if the the BAS
payments are to continue throughout the U.S. deployment.
   The airmen complain a bit about the heat, and the long hours
spent hunched under the seemingly endless line of F-15s needing
maintenance.
   Airman Adam Bayes describes the days this way: ``You go to work
for 12 hours, go home, get clean, go to bed, wake up, get clean,
whatever, do your laundry if you can do that, come to work, work,
go home, sleep. It's getting to be a routine.''
   So much so that Wilde spent his day off this week sitting around
watching his buddies work.
   ``I didn't know what else to do,'' he said.
   During a visit to the troops last week, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn
was pulled aside by Col. John McBroom, commander of the First
Tactical Fighter Wing. McBroom's message: Do something to keep the
extra money flowing to the families back home.
   There are some indications Congress might heed the advice of
McBroom and other commanders in the Saudi desert.
   At a White House meeting Wednesday, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio,
suggested that Congress and the administration agree on a pay and
income tax incentive package for the troops deployed in Saudi
Arabia ``to forestall a morale problem.''
   The airmen interviewed Wednesday predict just such problems if
the money is cut off. As the law stands now, servicemen lose the
extra payments when they get free meals.
   ``Every serviceman here that has heard about it is in an
uproar,'' said Jessen.
   ``They're telling us that for the opportunity to go and sweat
over in Saudi Arabia you may pay me, Uncle Sam, $180 a month,''
Jessen said. ``We've got family at home depending on that money and
we can't afford to lose it.''

<HEAD>Judges Conclude Audition Tape Was Menuhin or Kreisler, Not Blumita
Singer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRAN RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The screening committee reviewing
applications to the $20,000 International Violin Competition had
doubts about a Brazilian candidate, but her audition tape was so
dazzling they invited her to play.
   But when Blumita Singer did, she was so bad that some in the
audience giggled and others walked out.
   The panel of judges then reviewed the audition tape and soon
concluded it hadn't been Singer's artistry but that of Yehudi
Menuhin or Fritz Kreisler, two of this century's greatest
violinists.
   The judges disqualified Singer from the competition, the richest
in the world.
   ``It took just five notes for those 10 people to say, `Who's
this playing? It must be Menuhin or Kreisler,' '' Thomas J.
Beckiewicz, executive director of the annual contest, said
Wednesday. ``When you have 10 of the most expert violinists in the
world, you cannot fake anything.''
   Singer, 26, was sent home to Sao Paolo, Brazil, on Tuesday. She
had performed in Sunday's preliminary competition.
   She was the first person accused of fraud in the contest's
eight-year history.
   Besides the $20,000 cash prize, the competition offers concert
opportunities and recording contracts for the gold, silver and
bronze medalists. The gold medalist also debuts at Carnegie Hall.
   The screening committee reviewed more than 200 candidates;
Singer was among 53 who made the cut.
   Singer said on her application she received professional
training at the Manhattan School of Music in 1983-84 and at
Juilliard in 1982, and that she was taught by the late violinist
Henryk Szeryng from 1984 to 1987. She also listed several
competitions and awards, including first prizes in the 1983 Fritz
Kreisler talent award and 1975 National Young Soloists Competition.
   It was not immediately known whether she had falsified any of
those credentials.
   ``The screening committee looked at this portfolio with special
care because there were doubts in their minds from the beginning,''
Beckiewicz said.
   He said the committee had doubts about documents accompanying
the application, including recommendation letters, copies of
certificates of musical education, and programs and reviews of
concerts she supposedly had given.
   When she was confronted with the fraud allegation, she offered
``no admission, no regrets, no penitence,'' Beckiewicz said. She
showed ``no indignation ... but some stress that she was unmasked.''
   No further action will be taken against Singer, contest
officials said.
   She did not return a message left on the answering machine at
her home Wednesday.
   Singer was accepted as part of ``a very honest effort to search
out those who are less known,'' Beczkiewicz said. ``I don't want to
discourage the screening committee from taking a few risks.''
   However, he said that to prevent cheating, future applicants may
be required to submit a statement documenting the authenticity of
their tapes.
   Wednesday was the last day of preliminaries for the competition.
Beginning Friday, 16 semifinalists will perform full recitals over
four days. Six finalists then will be selected, and each will
perform with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. Medalists will be
announced Sept. 16.

   Bush administration officials say they fear an
oil shortage from the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait may develop
just at the time Americans turn up their furnaces for winter.
   If so, private analysts said it could cause a repeat of the
heating oil crisis last winter when the coldest December in 60
years sent prices of the fuel up by an average 45 cents a gallon on
the East Coast and related propane prices up by more than a dollar.
   Despite commitments by other producers to make up much of the
Iraqi-Kuwaiti output and record high inventories, both government
and private analysts said they expect a world shortage to develop
by the end of November.
   ``The last half of the fourth quarter gives us concern,''
Assistant Energy Secretary John J. Easton Jr. told the House
Government Operations Committee on Wednesday. ``We see the
potential for greater uncertainty as winter develops.''
   The 21-nation International Energy Agency foresees a shortage of
500,000 barrels a day developing over the next three months.
Because the winter seasonal demand for oil is expected to increase
by several million barrels a day, private analysts said the
shortage could be much larger, particularly if it is unusually cold.
   Edward N. Krapels, president of Energy Security Analysis Inc. of
Washington, said the shortfall ``could easily'' reach 2 million
barrels a day, possibly sending oil prices above $40 a barrel.
   ``We are convinced that useable commercial crude oil stocks will
be depleted by the end of October,'' he said. ``Anticipation of the
shortage will result in a run-up of crude oil prices that will be
translated into higher heating oil prices as the winter develops.''
   Krapels, whose firm closely monitors world oil supplies, said
the government could pre-empt a spiraling of home heating oil
prices by immediately drafting a contingency plan to begin drawing
down the nation's 590-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve in
November.
   ``A reasonable, organized, modest drawdown will send a signal
not only to the oil industry and to consumers but also to the
financial markets that the winter will be a difficult one, but not
an economy-breaking one,'' he said.
   The administration has said it will dip into the reserve only
when a real shortage occurs and not as a ``price mechanism.''
   Compounding the threat of heating oil shortages is the worldwide
lack of refining capacity. Now boycotted refineries in Kuwait and
Iraq accounted for about 1.2 percent of world's gasoline, jet and
diesel fuel and heating oil production.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. petroleum industry, in the face of high
operating costs and environmental opposition, has shut down more
than 100 refineries without building a single one in the past
decade.
   Calvin Kent, director of the government's Energy Information
Administration, said refineries already were operating at more than
90 percent capacity _ an all-time high _ to meet the summer demand
for gasoline and to build heating oil stockpiles when Iraq invaded
Kuwait last month.
   The cold snap last winter and related fires and explosions from
trying to continue production during it forced some refineries to
close and others to cut their output, an event that officials fear
could happen again.
   ``There's no question that an accident would cause a severe
impact'' on supply and prices, Kent said.

   The Democratic congressman from Connecticut
told Secretary of State James A. Baker III that everyone was
``thrilled'' with the administration's handling of the Persian Gulf
crisis. ``You've done a terrific job,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson.
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said
America was solidly behind President Bush's policies. Not since the
Cuban missile crisis, said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., had he seen
``as much pulling together as there is now.''
   ``Superb,'' said the senator from New York. ``You have made an
impression on the world, and that doesn't happen to many people
many times,'' Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan told Baker.
   Baker's testimony Tuesday and Wednesday marked the first
administration appearance before congressional committees since
Bush committed U.S. force in response to after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But with all the praise, there was an undertone of misgiving.
   Lawmakers wanted to know where the exit was. They wanted to know
what the United States would do about Saddam Hussein and his
country's nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities even if he
withdraws Kuwait.
   The questions betraying uneasiness were sandwiched between the
barrages of praise for the way Bush and Baker had won worldwide
cooperation and support.
   ``A brilliant job so far,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., but
``I need more explanations of where it's going to go from here,
what your plans are.''
   Baker's replies were often vague. He spoke of a regional
security arrangement _ some sort of Mideast NATO _ to check Saddam.
He spoke of a long-term American sea or land presence. And he
called for American patience.
   ``That is what we ask most of the American people,'' he said.
``Stand firm, be patient and remain united so that together we can
show that aggression does not pay.''
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said that even if Bush's goals are
met, ``we are left with an Iraq to deal with afterwards.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., wanted to know if Baker could not
provide some sort of ``international United Way campaign'' donor
chart, listing which countries were providing troops, which were
sending money, and how much.
   Biden wanted to know why Bush insists on returning the Kuwaiti
emir to power rather than taking the opportunity to encourage the
democratic selection of the country's leaders.
   Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa, making the same point, said an emirate
``is a little bit difficult from a historical American perspective
to be too thrilled about protecting.''
   Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., said he hated to be ``the skunk at
the garden party,'' but had to wonder if, deep down, this wasn't a
fight for cheap oil.
   ``I don't think that young men and young women of this country
are prepared to spill their blood in the sands of Saudi Arabia to
keep the price of gasoline cheap,'' Kostmayer said.
   Baker said protecting the world's oil supplies was an objective
but ``not the overriding reason why America is there.''
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., just back from a visit with the troops
in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi forces and U.S. Marines were in
position to shed the first blood in a war, ``but I didn't notice
any of our other allies.''
   Baker said 26 nations ``have sent military assets of one form or
another'' and he was hopeful others would. He offered to list other
commitments, but only in closed session.
   The extrication question was raised by Kostmayer at the House
Foreign Affairs Committee hearing: ``What if Saddam Hussein simply
stays where he is ...? Could this go on for months or years? Where
does this end?''
   ``We have not put a time frame on it,'' Baker replied, ``because
I'm not sure we can put a time frame on it now. ... It is
important, yes, that we succeed, but also that we build a regional
security structure that is able to contain the aggressive
tendencies of a leader like this.''
   Kostmayer persisted. ``Could it be years?''
   Baker said he would not want to speculate because some
continuing U.S. presence, on land or sea, would be called for in
the new regional security structure he foresaw.
   ``These are questions that are going to have to be addressed
down the line,'' he said, ``and they're questions that are going to
have to be studied considerably.''

   The United States is deploying
missile batteries, multiple rocket launchers and mines in Saudi
Arabia's northern desert to blunt any possible Iraqi thrust,
military officials say.
   In the last two days, Patriot missile batteries designed to
shoot down incoming missiles and multiple rocket launchers used to
smash troop buildups have been brought in to reinforce U.S.
positions closest to the Kuwaiti border.
   The weapons have been transported north over the past week in
huge convoys that also carried hundreds of troops to forward camps.
   U.S. Marines at a base camp close to the Kuwaiti border said
they were preparing to mine strategic north-south roads, but were
taking special precautions to protect refugees fleeing Kuwait.
   Mines will be placed along a side road running south from
Kuwait, with warnings posted for refugees, said the Marines, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The main highway from Kuwait to Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's
oil-rich eastern province is to be be drilled and wired so mines
can be placed at short notice to hinder any Iraqi advance.
   A Marine gunnery sergeant taking part in the mining operation
pointed out a small bridge connecting a highway that runs through
rough terrain.
   If the United States gets wind of a possible Iraqi attack,
``that'll be gone,'' he said.
   The deployments will help the United States improve its
ground-based fighting capabilities after relying on air power for
defense in the weeks following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Commanders say that in about a month the buildup will offer
enough firepower to make them comfortable about offensive
operations if they are ordered to attack.
   At the Marines' forward base camp, the commanding officer, Lt.
Col. Jim Mattis said his troops were in a defensive posture.
   ``We didn't come here to fight,'' Mattis said in an interview at
the base command post. ``My concern is to defend the area to which
I've been assigned. If someone wants to fight, we'll finish them
off.''
   Mattis said his troops can rely on air cover from Marine and
Royal Saudi Air Force attack helicopters and fighter jets,
including F-18s and vertical takeoff Harriers.
   On the ground, the Marines have tanks and other armored vehicles.
   The forwardmost U.S. forces are taking up positions in the
desert behind Saudi and Arab troops manning the frontline just
south of Kuwait.
   Scout patrols from the forward Marines _ the 7th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade is within 40 miles of Kuwait _ have advanced
beyond those forces on reconnaissance missions, said sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They're just getting the lay of the land. It's nothing
devious,'' one source said.
   The American forces appear to be growing more confident every
day as slow-moving ships carrying heavy ground force armor arrive
in the region.
   A cluster of ships carrying Marine amphibious forces are now a
few days from the Persian Gulf.
   The convoys moving north include double-decker buses carrying
hundreds of soldiers and dozens of transport trucks carrying tanks,
artillery and other heavy equipment. There also are scores of
refueling and other support vehicles for the tanks and infantry
carriers.
   An Army official said troop and equipment movements were being
made at night not to hide them, but because of the cooler
temperatures and to avoid raising fears among Saudis.
   ``Driving through towns in the middle of the day with a
half-mile-long row of tanks and rockets isn't a particularly good
idea,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Most of the gear transported north in the past few days belongs
to the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, a Georgia-based unit
armed with fast-moving M-1 tanks and Bradley Armored Fighting
Vehicles, or AFVs.
   Still being unloaded at a Saudi port is similar heavy equipment
for the 197th Infantry, which will join the 24th in the forwardmost
U.S. positions in Saudi Arabia.
   The Air Force brought F-111 bombers into the region earlier this
week and is adding to its fighter arsenal. Many of the new
squadrons are being based in other Persian Gulf nations.

<HEAD>Navy OKs Firing of Battleship Guns; Iowa Study Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has lifted its ban on firing the
battleship Wisconsin's 16-inch guns but an investigation continues
into the explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors aboard its
sister ship, the Iowa.
   The Wisconsin is in the Persian Gulf and is the only battleship
deployed in the conflict there.
   Should U.S. forces take action, the ship's huge guns could blast
shore points to protect a possible Marine land assault. The massive
weapons can heave 2,700-pound shells more than 20 miles.
   A Navy statement issued Wednesday at the Pentagon said the
battleship ``has been granted authority to begin live firing
training and operations.''
   Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III made the decision after
consulting the service's top admiral, Adm. Frank Kelso.
   The decision came after ``extensive testing'' of the gunpowder
bags used in the guns, said Navy spokesman Cmdr. Jim Mitchell.
   The Navy unit in charge of testing, the Naval Sea Systems
Command, ``has now determined that the guns may safely fire certain
lots of propellant,'' a Navy statement said.
   Mitchell said the Navy's investigation into the April 19, 1989
explosion aboard the Iowa is expected to be concluded later this
year.
   Mitchell said investigators have found that there was a greater
chance for an explosion in a gunpowder bag if a limited number of
propellant grains were in the top layer _ known as the tare layer _
of the bag.
   The gunpowder bags are filled with several layers of pellets, or
gun powder grains.
   Mitchell said investigators concluded during the past four
months of new tests ``that 20 or more grains of powder in the tare
layer provides a substantial safety margin, even if a bag of powder
should be compressed by a high-speed overram during the loading of
a 16-inch gun.''
   He said the Navy had removed from service all powder bags
containing less than 20 grains of powder in that layer. Still, he
said, ``this does not imply that these powder bags were unsafe.''
   Last year, the Navy said the Iowa explosion ``most probably''
was an intentional act by gunner's mate 2nd class Clayton Hartwig
of Cleveland.
   The service accused Hartwig of placing ``some type of detonation
device'' between the gunpowder bags while loading the 16-inch guns
during gunnery practice on board the Iowa. However, the Navy
admitted it only had circumstantial evidence.
   The Navy reopened its investigation of the explosion in May
after an ``unexplained ignition'' of some gunpowder bags occurred
during additional testing ordered by Congress.
   Some members of Congress, during their own investigation into
the Iowa explosion, suggested that ramming the gunpowder bags too
vigorously _ or instability in the gunpowder bags _ could have
caused the Iowa explosion.
   The suspension of firing the huge guns aboard the battleships
was ordered by Garrett on May 24.
   The Navy said the battleship Missouri will be authorized to
conduct live firing upon completion of a series of certifications
and inspections.
   The other two battleships _ the Iowa and the New Jersey _ are in
port and are scheduled to be decommissioned in 1991 because of
budget constraints.

   Three radical leftists have agreed to plead
guilty to a 1983 bombing at the U.S. Capitol and to setting off
bombs at seven other sites in New York and Washington.
   As part of their deal with prosecutors, charges against three
co-defendants are to be dropped.
   Laura J. Whitehorn, Linda S. Evans and Marilyn J. Buck are
scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court on Friday to plead
guilty to participating in a two-year campaign of ``armed
propaganda'' to set off bombs at government buildings and private
offices, according to court documents.
   The bombs caused property damage but did not injure any people.
   The Nov. 7, 1983 blast at the Capitol blew a hole in a wall
outside the U.S. Senate chamber, damaged five paintings and knocked
the door to Democratic leader Robert Byrd's office off its hinges.
   Bombing charges against three other members of the group, which
called itself the Armed Resistance Unit, the Revolutionary Fighting
Group or the Red Guerrilla Resistance, would be dropped as part of
the deal.
   Law enforcement officials have linked the group of radicals to
series of crimes dating back to the $1.6 million armed holdup of a
Brinks armored car near Nyack, N.Y. in 1981. Buck is serving a
50-year sentence for participating in a string of armed robberies,
including the Brinks holdup in which two policemen and a guard were
killed.
   The plea agreement was revealed in court papers filed last week
in federal court in Washington. The filing by U.S. Attorney Jay
Stephens gave no reason for the government's decision to settle the
case, saying only it was ``in the interest of justice.''
   Attorneys familiar with the case said a Supreme Court ruling
about double jeopardy in May influenced the government's decision
to drop charges gainst Susan L. Rosenberg, Timothy A. Blunk and
Alan Berkman.
   Both Rosenberg and Blunk are serving 58-year sentences for
possession of an arsenal of explosives. They were arrested in 1984
while loading more than 600 pounds of explosive material into a
rented storage bin in Cherry Hill, N.J.
   Berkman, a physician who is serving a 10-year sentence for
possession of explosives, firearms and fake identity cards, suffers
from Hodgkins disease.
   A seventh defendant in the case, Elizabeth Duke, is a fugitive.
   Rosenberg, Blunk and Berkman won dismissal of the charges
against them in 1989 when U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene held
that evidence used to convict them of the earlier charges was the
basis for the bombing indictment.
   But the charges were reinstated last fall when the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals here found that the double-jeopardy rule did not
apply to their case.
   The defense renewed its double jeopardy claim in June after the
high court ruled in a New York case that evidence used to convict a
person of one crime could not be submitted to charge the same
defendant with a different offense.
   Greene has not ruled on that motion.
   According to the deal outlined in court papers, Whitehorn, 45,
Buck, 43, and Evans, 43, agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and
malicious damage to the U.S. Capitol. The offenses carry a maximum
15-year prison term.
   Whitehorn also agreed to plead guilty to a fraud charge in
connection with the possession of false documents found in the
Baltimore apartment she shared with Buck and Evans. The charge
carries a maximum five-year sentence.
   In addition to the explosion at the Capitol, bombs were
detonated outside the National War College at Fort McNair here
April 26, 1983; the Washington Navy Yard Computer Center on Aug.
18, 1983; and the Washington Navy Yard Officers Club on April 20,
1984.
   Bombs were also placed at the FBI's office on Staten Island,
N.Y., on Jan. 28, 1983; the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building in
New York on April 5, 1984; the South African consulate in New York
on Sept. 26, 1984; and the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association on Feb. 23, 1985.

   It's only rock 'n' roll, but she plays it on a
harp.
   ``I hate to play classical,'' says Amy Lee, who entertains lunch
crowds at The Art Institute of Chicago with hits by the likes of
Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. ``But when people
request it, I get out my bag of Bach and my music stand and sit
there, pluck, pluck, plucking.''
   Lee, 34, got tired of black-tie formals, Bach and lounge-lizard
pop tunes like ``Feelings'' when she got hooked on rock as a
teen-ager.
   She has worked as a disc jockey and symphony musician, but her
solo career took off after she performed rock 'n' roll during a
1981 jazz festival in Chicago. She was dubbed ``The Angel of Rock.''
   ``I remember I got a standing ovation for playing `Stairway to
Heaven,' '' she said.
   Lee looks the part of a rock angel. Decked out in bright colors,
a short skirt, bold earrings and dark sunglasses, she taps her feet
and sways as her fingers speed across the 6-foot, 47-string antique
harp her father gave her when she was 7.
   ``The kind of music she makes should be paid attention to,''
said Alek Jakich, an inspector for the city of Chicago and a
regular at the Art Institute's outdoor restaurant, where Lee has
worked the last eight summers.
   ``When was the last time your heard Pink Floyd on the harp?''
Jakich asked. ``And it's great.''
   Playing rock is a switch from when Lee performed with the
Northwest Indiana Symphony and the Twin City Symphony of St.
Joseph, Mich. Being alone on stage is also a switch.
   ``I'm usually background music,'' the 5-foot-5 blonde said at a
performance Tuesday. ``So I decided, `Why not play something I
like?' ''
   That day, her songs by the Eurythmics, the Kinks and The Police
got her a complimentary glass of wine from two women having lunch,
praise from a mother visiting the gallery with her toddler, and
applause after nearly every song.
   Waiters came up to whisper several requests during her
performance in the outdoor atrium scattered with white tables and
matching parasols.
   ``Once they hear the rock songs, then they want to request
them,'' said Lee, who also performs in lounges and has her own jazz
group. ``I've gotten requests for Tom Petty and the Grateful Dead.
But I also get requests for `Lady of Spain.' ''

<HEAD>Tax Hike Said Needed for Education; Poll Says People Will Pay</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increased taxes are inevitable in improving
America's schools, state and local educators say as a national poll
suggests Americans may be willing to pay.
   Kentucky Education Secretary Jack Foster, California State
Superintendent Bill Honig and Pat Tornillo Jr. of the United
Teachers of Dade, Miami, Fla. said Wednesday that tax increases are
essential to finance the numerous education reform proposals by
local, state and federal officials. But, they stressed that
property taxes should not be the only funding source.
   ``The taxpayer issue is bugging everyone interested in school
reform,'' said Foster.
   Their comments during an all-day education conference hosted by
CBS News at Georgetown University underscored the results of a CBS
News poll that showed Americans would support a tax hike if the
money went to their own neighborhood schools.
   According to the poll, 71 percent of the 1,107 adults
interviewed by telephone between May 30 and June 2 would be willing
to pay $100 a year more in taxes if all the money were used for
schools in their community. Of those with children in school, 77
percent said they would be willing to pay more in taxes.
   Forty-nine percent of those involved in the nationwide random
sample would be willing to pay $100 more in taxes even if all the
money were to be used to help pay for schools in other communities,
the poll showed.
   ``We in Kentucky, and I think in every other state in the union,
still continues to use property tax as the index against which to
measure how much money can be raised,'' said Foster. ``Kentucky now
raises less than half of its local school taxes from direct
property tax.''
   Foster said other funding now comes from income and utility
taxes.
   Local school revenues, mostly from property taxes, account for
50 percent or more of school revenues in 20 states, the National
Education Association said. A breakdown by percentage includes 89.6
in New Hampshire, 70.8 in Nebraska, 66.9 in Oregon, 63.4 in South
Dakota, 60.6 in Virginia, 59.3 in Nevada, 59 in Michigan, 58.2 in
Vermont, 57 in Colorado and 56.8 in Wisconsin.
   Also, 56.4 in Missouri, 56.3 in Maryland, 54.7 in New Jersey,
54.4 in Illinois, 53.2 in Massachusetts, 51.8 in Rhode Island, 51.7
in New York, 51.6 in Connecticut, 51.5 in Kansas and 50.2 in
Arizona.
   New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio said that policy makers must not only
focus on educational expenses but what it will cost not to
implement the improvements, such as increased welfare rolls and
larger prisons. He succeeded in pushing through a complex $2.8
billion tax package along with a controversial school financing
formula designed to shift existing aid from rich suburban districts
to poor, mostly urban systems.

   Dirty Harry is hanging up his Magnum.
   Clint Eastwood said Wednesday he plans no more sequels to the
shoot-'em-up movies featuring a San Francisco detective known for
his .44 and his taunting line to bad guys, ``Make my day.''
   ``I don't know where you'd take him,'' said Eastwood, who has
starred in five ``Dirty Harry'' films.
   ``The very dangerous thing about doing sequels is you can fall
into a pattern of self-imitation. You'd have to have an awfully
good script to take you away from that.''
   Eastwood's latest venture as actor and director, ``White Hunter,
Black Heart,'' explores the obsession of a movie director bent on
bagging an elephant in Africa. Eastwood plays the director, modeled
on the late John Huston.
   He spoke to reporters during a three-week retrospective of his

   Todd Bridges, the former child actor
acquitted in the shooting of an alleged drug dealer, has returned
to his craft in a deputy sheriff's uniform for a part in ``The New
Lassie.''
   Bridges, who appeared in the series ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' began
work Wednesday on the syndicated show about the world's most famous
collie and was greeted by a dozen photographers and TV news crews.
   Bridges, who has admitted to past drug problems, has a role in
one episode that will air later this season.
   ``Todd looked good. He looked clear-eyed,'' spokesman Cliff
Dektar said. ``Todd is clean.''

   Barbara Mandrell's family feared she
might attempt suicide after a near-fatal car crash in 1984, the
country music star says in her autobiography.
   Mandrell said in the book, ``Get to the Heart,'' that her
husband, Ken Dudney, emptied pistols he kept in their home and
locked them away in a closet.
   She said she never considered using the guns. ``But I can see
Ken's point in hiding them. I was a girl who did not have a great
will to live,'' Mandrell said.
   Mandrell, 41, suffered a concussion, broken leg and other
injuries in a collision near Nashville. The driver of the other car
was killed.
   She said in the book due out next week that the accident changed
her forever. ``Gone is the precocious little girl, so optimistic,
so energetic, like a teen-ager out on her first date,'' she said.
   Mandrell once had a TV variety show with her sisters. Her hit
songs include ``I Was Country (When Country Wasn't Cool)'' and
``Sleeping Single in a Double Bed.''

   The Yale Review, the oldest literary
quarterly in the country, has some powerful friends, but George
Plimpton, Joyce Carol Oates and others may not be able to save it.
   The prestigious quarterly, which introduced Eudora Welty, Robert
Frost, Robert Penn Warren, Virginia Woolf and Eugene O'Neill, is to
be shelved after issuing its 79th volume in November.
   More than 50 novelists, critics, professors and poets have
signed a petition opposing the decision to halt publication. The
petition was delivered Tuesday to Yale President Benno C. Schmidt
Jr.
   Schmidt announced in June that Yale would close the quarterly,
citing financial problems, limited readership and the absence of
any direct tie to Yale's academic programs.
   Annie Dillard, author of ``Pilgrim at Tinker Creek''; Plimpton,
editor of The Paris Review, and Charles McGrath, deputy editor of
The New Yorker magazine, were among those to sign the petition.
   Schmidt said he wasn't confident of raising the $1 million or so
needed for an endowment to cover the magazine's annual cost of
$60,000 to $80,000.

<HEAD>HHS Sets Goals for Healthier 1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials today unveiled goals
for improving Americans' health over the next decade, to be
achieved by encouraging healthy living and preventing disease.
   ``We can no longer afford not to invest in prevention,'' Dr.
James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the Department of
Health and Human Services, said in a 671-page report.
   ``From the perspective of avoiding human suffering as well as
saving wasteful costs for treating diseases and injuries that could
have been prevented, the 1990s should be the decade of prevention
in the United States,'' he said.
   The report identifies 298 specific health objectives covering a
range of areas, including fitness, nutrition, tobacco, alcohol,
drugs, family planning, mental health, occupational and
environmental health, food safety, cancer, heart disease, AIDS,
infant health and sexually transmitted diseases.
   The key to good health, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said in his
foreword to the report, is ``personal responsibility, which is to
say responsible and enlightened behavior by each and every
individual.''
   Among the objectives to be obtained by the year 2000 were:
   _Increasing 30 percent the proportion of people who engage in
regular, moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day.
In 1985, an estimated 22 percent of people were doing this.
   _Reduce the prevalence of overweight adults to no more than 20
percent, down from the current 26 percent.
   _Cut to 15 percent the proportion of adults who smoke. In 1987,
an estimated 29 percent of the population smoked.
   _Reduce pregnancies to 50 per 1,000 girls under 18. In this age
group, 71 per 1,000 girls became pregnant in 1985.
   _Increase use of automobile safety restraints to 85 percent of
occupants, up from the current 42 percent who report using them.
   _Eliminate elevated blood lead levels in children under 5.
Currently, 10 percent of these children have levels above 25
micrograms per deciliter.
   _Reduce infant mortality to 7 deaths per 1,000 births.
Provisional data for 1989 shows a rate of 9.7 per 1,000.
   _Cut coronary heart disease deaths to 100 per 100,000. In 1987,
135 per 100,000 died from this disease.
   _Reverse the rise in cancer deaths, from 133 per 100,000 in 1987
down to at least the 1970 rate of 130 per 100,000 by the turn of
the century.
   _Limit annual incidence of diagnosed AIDS cases to 98,000. An
estimated 44,000-50,000 cases were diagnosed in 1989.
   The objectives in ``Healthy People 2000'' were developed in a
three-year effort led by the Public Health Service and involved
more than 300 voluntary and professional organizations and state
health departments.
   They build on a similar effort begun in 1979 in which national
goals were set for 1990. Data for the previous 10 years has not
been compiled yet and an assessment of the first set of goals was
not expected until next year.
   A mid-course review in 1986 found that about half the 226
objectives had been achieved or likely would be by the end of the
decade. These included reductions in high blood pressure, smoking
and motor vehicle accidents and increases in immunizations.
   But about a quarter of the objectives were not likely to be met
and a similar proportion could not be measured. Targets of concern
included infant mortality among minority and low-income women, drug
abuse and the proportion of Americans who are overweight.

<TEXT>
   Presidential chief of staff John Sununu, back
from a managerial mission to Moscow, says the Soviet Union is going
through a debate similar to what the United States faced in framing
its own Constitution two centuries ago.
   Sununu and a team of top White House aides spent five days last
week in Moscow and Leningrad. It was a return visit with Soviet
efficiency experts who toured the White House and several Cabinet
departments in June looking for tips on how to run the Soviet
Union's rapidly changing government.
   Sununu said the Americans gave the Soviets plenty of
nuts-and-bolts advice then. This time, he said, the Soviets were
more interested in discussing broader issues of government,
including how to balance the role of the central government in
Moscow with demands for independence from the 15 Soviet republics.
   In an interview with news agency reporters Wednesday, Sununu
said the Soviets are experiencing something like what ``our country
went through about 210 years ago as we worked from the Articles of
Confederation to our own Constitution.''
   The framers of the U.S. Constitution had to go back then and
``convince the states that they ought to give up all the powers
they had to the new central government,'' he said.
   In the Soviet Union, on the other hand, ``they're trying to
convince the federal government to give back all the powers to the
republics,'' Sununu said. ``But the same issues are being debated:
the issue of currency, the issue of the banks, the issue of who
owns the resources within the lands.''
   Sununu said he is convinced that there is no turning back from
the Soviet Union's march away from communism and towards a market
economy.
   ``Not once in any of our discussions did the word `communism'
come up. Not once,'' he said. ``We didn't find anybody who wanted
to turn back'' from economic reforms.
   ``There was an undertone to all the discussions .. that a lot of
the pulling and tugging of breaking it up is so that they can come
back and renegotiate putting it back together again,'' said Sununu.
   ``Nobody seemed to be doing it just for the sake of stirring the
pot. ... They all seemed to be very sincere in trying to work this
thing out.''
   Among other things, Sununu said he was asked what special
perquisites went with working for the U.S. government.
   ``It was a big surprise for them'' to hear that top federal
officials made less working for the government than they could
command in business, he said.
   Sununu and his group met with Boris Yeltsin, the ex-communist
party maverick and president of the Russian Republic, as well as
Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and other top Soviet officials.
   A meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was on the
schedule, but it was scrapped when Gorbachev wound up in a marathon
meeting instead with Yeltsin that produced an agreement for radical
economic reforms.
   Sununu praised the Kremlin's computerized personnel system,
which he said tracks both job openings and top candidates.
   ``In some sense, we wish we kind of had one as detailed and as
efficient as that,'' he said.
   The Soviets select people from a more narrow group and ``have
almost everybody's background and capacity available at their
fingertips,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bad Books, Poor Teachers Cripple Biology Education, Panel Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Books written to not offend adults, teachers
who are poorly trained and a curriculum that ``seems designed to
snuff out interest'' are all crippling biology education in
America, a National Academy of Sciences panel said in a study
released today.
   The study said correcting the flaws in the way American school
children are taught biology will require changes on virtually every
level of education _ from the preparing of teachers, to the
attitudes of parents, school boards and local governments.
   Among the points made:
   _ Biology teaching starts too late in school and ``is generally
of such poor quality that students learn to dislike science.''
   _ Textbooks are often too long, abysmally crafted and written
``with the implicit aim of avoiding offense to a scientifically
illiterate segment of the adult population.''
   _ Schools of education, where teachers are taught to teach,
``present pedagogical information so unrelated to the specifics of
teaching science as to be of little or no help.''
   _ Middle and high school students are taught science as courses
in memorizing terms which they soon forget. ``Most students leave
the experience with the conviction that further exposure to science
is something to be avoided if at all possible,'' the report said.
   _ It noted that a test given 12,000 American high school
students showed that half who had not taken biology did as well or
better than 40 percent of those who had taken such courses.
   ``Clearly,'' the report said, ``a great many children are
learning almost nothing in their biology courses.''
   _ ``Too many of our teachers,'' the report said, ``are recruited
from the lowest academic quartile of the college population.''
Further, teachers are given little opportunity update their
scientific knowledge or to interact with research scientists in
industry or academia.
   ``The preparation of teachers needs drastic reform,'' the report
said.
   To improve the system, the National Academy of Sciences panel
these and other changes need to be made:
   _ Start teaching courses in science during the elementary school
years and devote more class time to the subject. Orient
middle-school courses toward human biology to help overcome
misinformation about health, hygiene and disease. And, in high
school, teach central concepts in an easy language instead of
involving detailed, complex terms that must be memorized. The
courses should laboratory work.
   _ Textbooks should be reviewed by the scientific community to
assure accuracy and currency, and working scientists should assist
school boards and teachers in evaluating proposed texts.
   _ Testing should be revised so that it does not drive the
curriculum. The nation, the report said, should be more interested
in teaching and materials than in ranking student performance.
   _ ``Research is need on what makes education programs for
teachers effective,'' the study said. It recommended that science
teachers should be given opportunities to train in actual
laboratories of research scientists. Colleges should develop
undergraduate training for teachers that includes advice from
scientists on how best to teach science.
   _ Universities should offer summertime training programs for
elementary, middle and high school science teachers. Continuing
education of teachers should include not just what to teach, but
how to teach.
   Though the panel declined to make a cost estimate, the report
said that ``a major commitment of funds will be needed'' to
accomplish the goals of improving biology education.
   The report was prepared by three committees that included more
than 50 educators and scientists from many parts of the country and
selected by the National Research Council. The council is an
affiliate of the National Academy of Sciences.

<HEAD>New York GOP Candidate Would Work For $1 A Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican candidate for governor Pierre
Rinfret pledged that, if elected, he would work for $1 a year ``as
long as the state remains in fiscal trouble.''
   Rinfret, claiming Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo had created ``a
credit-card state'' that was on its way to bankruptcy, unveiled a
plan to freeze state spending and cut taxes as a means of restoring
New York's fiscal health.
   With New York facing a potential budget deficit he estimated at
$2.4 billion for next year, Rinfret told a news conference
Wednesday that he would ask state workers to accept a one-year
salary freeze. He said that would save $300 million.
   Rinfret also said he would freeze most state spending next year
to save an additional $800 million. In all, Rinfret said his
proposals could cut state spending by $1.5 billion. He said an
anticipated 3 percent growth in state revenues would provide the
remaining $900 million to close the deficit.
   Cuomo campaign spokesman William Cunningham dismissed Rinfret's
proposals as ``just a political document for press conference
purposes. ... He's made a lot of assumptions.''
   Cuomo press secretary Gary Fryer joked about Rinfret's pledge to
work for $1 a year.
   ``I'm sure he'll be worth every penny of it,'' said the Cuomo
aide.
   Fryer said Cuomo, who accepts $100,000 of the governor's
$130,000-a-year salary, had no plans to make a similar pledge.

<HEAD>Mecham: Government Workers Shouldn't Live In Sin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State workers who engage in sex outside of
marriage should not be allowed to keep their jobs, Republican
gubernatorial hopeful Evan Mecham says.
   ``From my viewpoint, they shouldn't be in government service
because they're lawbreakers,'' Mecham said in a campaign appearance.
   Arizona has laws against a variety of sexual acts, as well as
against ``open and notorious cohabitation,'' but the laws are
seldom enforced.
   Mecham was elected governor in 1986. He offended homosexuals,
women, blacks, Hispanics, Jews and Orientals with a series of
remarks and was impeached and ousted on unrelated charges in 1988.
   ``I never went out looking or declaring war on homosexuals,''
Mecham said in an appearance on Phoenix radio station KTAR.
   He said there are ``other lawbreakers too that shouldn't be
allowed there. I'm not just picking homosexuals out.
   ``I don't know that we will ever launch a program to try to get
everybody who's living a lifestyle that isn't totally within the
cover of the law out because there are a lot of those people,''
said Mecham.
   Asked to elaborate after the program, Mecham said he believed
any lawbreakers, including heterosexuals who engage in sexual acts
without being married, should not be in government either. He made
the comments Tuesday.

<HEAD>Dukakis Criticizes His Lieutenant Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An angry Gov. Michael S. Dukakis criticized his
own lieutenant governor after she talked of taking over the ailing
state government while he was gone on a European trade mission.
   Dukakis, who decided to postpone his trip, accused Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy of playing politics in her bid to win the Democratic
nomination for governor.
   Dukakis spoke with Murphy on Wednesday, and afterwards said
``what I heard was a candidate who was trying to use this state's
fiscal situation for personal political gain.''
   Murphy had said she was waiting for Dukakis to leave the state
so, as acting governor, she could push her own plan for curing the
state's fiscal troubles.
   ``I'll put my proposals on the table if he continues on his
trip,'' Murphy said. ``When I'm in charge, I'll show you how I make
some decisions.''
   She did not make any details of the plan public. And a Dukakis
administration source said she even refused to provide the governor
with details in a telephone conversation when he asked her for them.
   ``This is Alexandra Haig with Nixon's secret plan,'' said
Dukakis spokesman Stephen Crawford. He referred to then-Secretary
of State Alexander Haig's comments that he was in charge at the
White House when President Reagan was shot. Richard Nixon said
during the 1968 elections that he had a plan to end the Vietnam
war, but did not make it public.
   Murphy has been trailing her two Democratic opponents, Francis
X. Bellotti and John Silber, who have tried to link her with the
state's fiscal disaster under the Dukakis administration.

<TEXT>
   Charles Keating Jr., a key figure in the
savings and loan crisis, is agreeing to give notice of any large
transactions and not to transfer assets out of the country.
   Under an agreement announced Wednesday by the Justice
Department, Keating must file financial statements with the Office
of Thrift Supervision and must tell that agency 48 hours in advance
of any transactions exceeding $5,000.
   Those terms had previously been imposed on Keating by a
preliminary injunction issued by the U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles. Wednesday's announcement indicated he had agreed to them.
   Keating already has provided financial statements, which have
not been disclosed.
   Regulators wanted to determine if Keating transferred money out
of the country _ and out of their reach _ because he had traveled
extensively in Switzerland and the Bahamas in the last few years.
Keating has denied transferring any funds overseas.
   The Justice Department reached the agreement, which was filed in
the Los Angeles court, on behalf of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, an agency of the Treasury Department.
   The OTS had previously ordered Keating to prove his assertion
that he is broke. The agency partially froze his assets in
connection with its efforts to recover $41 million from Keating and
five associates.
   The government's enforcement efforts stem from the collapse of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which
Keating controlled and has been accused of looting. Regulators
estimate the failure may cost taxpayers $2 billion, ranking with
Miami's CenTrust Bank as the costliest S&amp;L failures.
   Keating earned huge salaries, lived lavishly and contributed
heavily to politicians while he headed American Continental Corp.,
a development company based in Phoenix that owned Lincoln.
   His case has attracted particular attention because of his $1.3
million in contributions to the campaigns of five senators:
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Alan Cranston of
California, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona and John Glenn of Ohio.
   Keating has contended he never broke any laws and that
government officials are making him a scapegoat to conceal their
own inability to prevent the S&amp;L disaster.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin in Washington recently
dismissed Keating's lawsuit to recover control of Lincoln, saying
actions by Keating and his cohorts ``amounted to a looting of
Lincoln.''
   After the ruling, Keating resigned as chairman and chief
executive of American Continental, which is in bankruptcy
proceedings.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, says he has a plan
to reduce the federal deficit by cutting $27 billion from the
government's administrative expenses.
   Smith wrote congressional colleagues Wednesday proposing to trim
10 percent of $270 billion spent on travel, phone calls, printing,
lights and other costs.
   He said the idea is better than having across-the-board cuts,
due to take effect automatically under the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law unless targets are met for reducing the
deficit.
   ``What this says to federal office managers is `You need to
determine within your office how to cut indirect costs 10 percent.
You can do it by having one fewer training sessions. You can do it
by taking less travel. You can do it by having fewer supplies,'''
Smith said.
   Budget negotiators are scheduled to resume meeting this weekend
seeking ways to reduce the deficit by $50 billion.
   Using data from the Office of Management and Budget, Smith said
his staff determined the government will spend about $340 billion
in overhead, or indirect costs, next year. Smith exempted about $70
billion in research and development appropriations to get the $270
billion figure. He said it does not include salaries.

<HEAD>FDA Considers Regulating Dietary Supplements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is rethinking
whether to regulate dietary supplements such as L-tryptophan, which
has been linked to the deaths of 27 Americans.
   Although the agency started requiring a federal safety review
before a nutritional supplement could be marketed in 1973, the FDA
stopped trying to enforce its rule after two unsuccessful court
cases.
   Since the mid-1970s, ``the FDA has largely maintained a
hands-off posture towards dietary supplements in general,''
spokesman Jeff Nesbit said Wednesday.
   Since the health threat that resulted in all L-tryptophan-based
products being taken off the market in March, however, the FDA has
begun to review that policy. Acting FDA Commissioner James Benson
recently asked agency officials ``to examine our regulation of this
whole area,'' Nesbit said.
   L-tryptophan, an amino acid used to treat insomnia, depression
and obesity, was ordered off the market after it was linked to an
outbreak of a rare blood disorder called eosinophilia-myalgia
syndrome. The syndrome has struck 1,500 people and killed 27,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   The outbreak has been traced to one Japanese manufacturer of
L-tryptophan. A study by Minnesota scientists linked the deaths to
a change in the how the supplement was made.
   The main regulatory obstacle in the FDA's mind is a 1976 law,
sponsored by then-Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., prohibiting the
FDA from acting against makers of vitamins and minerals unless
there is a clear public health risk.
   The Proxmire amendment does not address dietary supplements
specifically, but FDA officials believe the law and the two court
cases leave the agency with little power to act.
   Other dietary supplement makers say the FDA has the authority it
needs.

<HEAD>Government Changes Tune, Says No Extradition For Drug Lords Who
Surrender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major turnaround in Colombia's
anti-drug strategy, President Cesar Gaviria has announced that
cocaine traffickers who surrender will not be extradited to the
United States.
   The new president said his decree Wednesday is part of a plan to
end drug-related terrorism. A year-old war between the government
and traffickers fighting extradition has left hundreds of people
dead.
   ``Those who have been in crime and who have repented, and who
voluntarily turn themselves in to judges in order to freely confess
their crimes may be tried by our judges based on our judicial
order,'' Gaviria said in a nationally televised speech Wednesday
night.
   In July, the Medellin cocaine cartel declared a unilateral
cease-fire in its terrorist attacks, apparently hoping that the new
administration would end extraditions.
   Gaviria, who was inaugurated Aug. 7, said in his speech that
criminals who turn themselves in will also face lighter sentences.
   ``Judges will be given the capacity to reduce sentences ... of
those who turn themselves in, confess their crimes, lay down
weapons and other goods linked to their crimes and cooperate with
investigations.''
   In repeated communiques, drug traffickers using the pseudonym
``The Extraditables'' have offered to turn themselves in to
Colombian judges if the government promises to end extraditions.
   Their communiques bore the letterhead, ``We prefer a tomb in
Colombia to a jail cell in the United States.''
   Extradition is a sensitive issue in Colombia because many people
believe sending people to be tried in a foreign country is an
insult to national pride. Still, Colombia's justice system has so
far failed to keep any major drug trafficker in jail. Traffickers
often bribe or threaten officials into letting them go free. Many
judges who refused to be intimidated have been murdered.
   Gaviria has said fortifying the judicial system is a major
priority in his administration. The government plans to build
special ``fortress cities'' where judges and their families can
live and work free of intimidation.
   Gaviria's predecessor, Virgilio Barco, resumed extradited
accused drug traffickers to the United States a year ago after drug
bosses declared ``total war'' on the state.
   In his speech Wednesday, Gaviria said three Colombians currently
awaiting extradition would be sent to the United States. But he
said three other extradition requests by the United States have
been rejected.
   Currently, 14 people are in Colombian jails awaiting
extradition. The Barco administration extradited 22 Colombians.
   The government blames the Medellin cartel for killing more than
500 people, including at least two presidential candidates, in a
long series of bombings and assassinations.
   The war began in August 1989 with the assassination of Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan, a presidential hopeful of the governing Liberal Party
who took a tough stand against the drug lords.
   Gaviria, Galan's campaign manager, became the party's winning
candidate.
   In addition to the victims of the drug war with the government,
thousands of people have died in fighting between rival drug gangs
and violence blamed on right wing death squads financed by cocaine
smugglers.
   Gaviria said the new judicial measures apply to members of
paramilitary groups as well as drug traffickers.
   Members of paramilitary groups say they are merely farmers and
ranchers seeking to defend themselves from leftist guerrillas. But
human rights activists say the groups are drug-financed death
squads that kill peasants suspected of sympathizing with guerrillas.
   In his speech, Gaviria reiterated his call for international
cooperation in fighting drugs. He said Colombia has been successful
in reducing cocaine supplies on U.S. streets.
   ``Once again we ask of the international community an effective
solidarity which transends the realm of words and pep talks,'' the
president said.
   He asked developed countries to limit drug consumption, money
laundering, arms trafficking and the sale of chemicals used to
process cocaine.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels supply most of the cocaine
consumed in the United States and Europe.

<HEAD>Judge Turns Down Wrongful Death Claim in Senator's Suicide</HEAD>

   Navy doctors were not responsible for the
suicide of Sen. John East, a federal judge ruled in rejecting his
widow's $3.5 million wrongful-death claim.
   Priscilla East had contended that government doctors who provide
care for members of Congress did not promptly diagnose a thyroid
disorder and that the delay led to her husband's suicide in 1986.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Black on Wednesday ruled the care the
North Carolina Republican received at Bethesda Naval Medical Center
was ``not perfect'' but did not constitute negligence.
   Terri Steinhaus, one of Mrs. East's lawyers, called the ruling
unfortunate but said no decision had been made on whether to
appeal. The lawyer said Mrs. East had no comment.
   A government lawyer said the decision vindicates the doctors.
``The physicians have had to live with a cloud over their careers
for some period of time,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Ira Oring.
   Black's ruling came four months after an eight-week trial he
presided over without a jury.
   East, 55, a first-term senator, killed himself by running his
car in the closed garage of his Greenville, N.C., home. He left a
note accusing his doctors of having ``ruined my health.''
   East's hyperthyroidism was discovered after a resident doctor at
Bethesda ordered a test on East in April 1985. Hypothyroidism
occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce a hormone necessary
to regulate the body's metabolism.
   Mrs. East claimed Navy doctors could have diagnosed her
husband's hypothyroidism much earlier. The delay triggered a severe
depression that led to his suicide, she contended.
   East had been brought to the center in 1985 after lapsing into a
near fatal coma. Shortly after regaining consciousness, East tried
to kill himself by ramming a chair leg down his throat.

<HEAD>Study: Household Cigarette Smoke Endangers Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study published today says parents who smoke may
raise the risk their children will get lung cancer when they grow
up.
   The study in the New England Journal of Medicine is the first to
suggest that passive smoking is especially hazardous for youngsters.
   It found that non-smoking adults who lived at least 13 years
with two cigarette smokers during their childhood and adolescence
face double the usual risk of getting lung cancer.
   ``The findings from this and other studies have made me feel it
is a very prudent thing to discourage people from smoking in your
house,'' said Dr. Dwight T. Janerich, who directed the study.
   His research, conducted at Yale medical school, suggests that
exposure to smoke in the home early in life is to blame for 17
percent of all lung cancer among people who never smoked.
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that about 25,000
of the more than 150,000 new cases of lung cancer annually occur
among non-smokers, and 40 percent of them, or 10,000 people, never
smoked. If the latest estimate is correct, this means that about
1,700 cases each year are caused by childhood exposure to other
people's cigarette smoke.
   ``Children are really a captive audience,'' said Dr. Alfred
Munzer, a spokesman for the American Lung Association and a
pulmonary specialist at Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma
Park, Md. ``They're the ideal guinea pig, because they have no way
of escaping their parents' smoke. It's not surprising that they
should show the effects of passive smoking.''
   Lung cancer may occur long after people stop smoking. Janerich
said secondhand smoke may be especially hazardous to children
because they have so many years ahead of them in which to develop
lung cancer.
   ``It makes a strong case that exposure to secondhand smoke as a
child increases your risk as an adult. This is quite convincing,''
commented Dr. Stanton Glantz of the University of California at San
Francisco.
   The study turned up no evidence that smoking by spouses or
co-workers causes cancer, although the researchers cautioned that
their work could not rule out this possibility.
   The study was based on a survey of 191 non-smokers in New York
state who were diagnosed with lung cancer in the early 1980s.
Researchers calculated their lifetime exposure to cigarette smoke
and compared it with that of healthy non-smokers.
   The researchers calculated each person's ``smoker-years'' _ the
number of years they lived in a house multiplied by the number of
smokers there. For instance, someone who lived at home for 18 years
with two smoking parents had an exposure of 36 smoker-years.
   The study found that exposure of 25 or more smoker-years during
childhood and adolescence doubles the risk of lung cancer.
Twenty-seven percent of the cancer victims had this level of
exposure, compared with 15 percent of the healthy comparison group.
   Household exposure of less than 25 exposure-years while growing
up did not appear to increase the risk of lung cancer.
   Exposure to a husband or wife's smoke made up less than a third
of total household exposure on average, and it was not linked with
an increased risk. Munzer said this might be explained by the fact
that spouses who work spend relatively few waking hours together at
home, so their exposure to smoke is short.
   While the study did not examine the effects of passive smoking
on the heart, some believe this may be an even more important
hazard. In other work, Glantz has calculated that secondhand smoke
may cause 10 times as much heart disease as lung disease.
   This would make passive smoking the third leading cause of
preventable death behind active smoking and alcohol abuse.

   ``Cheers'' bumped ``60 Minutes'' from the No.
1 spot in the ratings after two weeks in which the Persian Gulf
crisis helped put the CBS news magazine on top.
   In the overall ratings last week, NBC claimed first place for
the 16th week in a row, with seven of the top 10 shows, the A.C.
Nielsen Co. said Wednesday.
   Sunday's repeat of ``60 Minutes'' contained no updates on the
Persian Gulf.
   ``I think the biggest reason was that it was a holiday
weekend,'' program spokesman Roy Brunett said. ``People just
weren't watching television.''
   In the latest standings, ``60 Minutes'' plummeted to a two-way
tie for 15th with NBC's comedy ``Grand.''
   Overall, NBC had a 10.6 average, well ahead of CBS with an 8.8.
ABC was last with an 8.7. Each ratings point represents 931,000
households.
   NBC's spinoff of the Oscar-winning film ``In the Heat of the
Night'' grabbed its highest ranking ever. The story of a white
Southern police chief (Carroll O'Connor) and his black detective
(Howard Rollins) was No. 2.
   Fox Broadcasting's young Bart Simpson suffered another
staggering loss to Bill Cosby on NBC.
   A special repeat Monday made ``The Cosby Show'' No. 5 in the
rankings. In its regular Thursday time slot against ``The
Simpsons,'' Cosby was No. 11. The animated Simpsons finished in a
four-way tie for 53rd place.
   Fox's preview of the fall sitcom ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose'' won
its Sunday time slot with an 8.1. ``True Colors,'' another Fox
comedy, fared less well in its Sunday debut, capturing a 7.8.
   ABC and Peter Jennings won the network evening news battle again
with a 10 average. CBS and Dan Rather were second with 9.3 and NBC
and Tom Brokaw had an 8.7.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Cheers,''
NBC, 16.6; ``In the Heat of the Night,'' NBC, 15.7; ``Empty Nest,''
NBC, and ``Designing Women,'' CBS, (tie) 14.6; ``The Cosby Show''
(special), NBC, and ``Murphy Brown,'' CBS, (tie) 14; ``The Golden
Girls,'' NBC, 13.8; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 13.6; NBC Sunday Night Movie
``I Know My First Name is Steven,'' NBC, 13.4, ``A Different
World,'' NBC, 13.3.

   The dollar lost further ground against the Japanese
yen Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost
moderately.
   The dollar closed at 141.65 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's
close. After opening at 141.48 yen, the currency ranged between
141.35 yen and 142.45 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Exchange of 225 selected issues shed 266.43
points, or 1.11 percent, closing at 23,811.91. The index lost
829.30 points Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond edged higher at 8.240 percent as of 3 p.m.
(2 a.m. EDT), up from Wednesday's close of 8.180 percent. The price
stood at 82.50 points, down from 82.76 points.
   Currency dealers said the dollar started lower following its
overnight decline in New York, but the currency was bought back
over reports that a U.S. citizen was shot by Iraqi soldiers in
Kuwait.
   Masakazu Kimura, a dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, said the
dollar moved lower over dollar-selling by life insurance firms in
early trading but was later bought back after the unconfirmed
shooting reports.
   A State Department official said the government believed the
report of the shooting was well founded.
   In stock trading, the highly watched Nikkei index posted a
moderate gain during early trading, but retreated after rounds of
buying, securities dealers said.
   ``The index lost as much as 292 points at one point with many
market players taking a wait-and-see position because of lowering
of futures,'' said a Nomura Securities dealer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, North Sea Brent crude oil for November delivery was
valued at $29.20 a barrel in Tokyo, up from its close of $28.60 in
London Wednesday.

<HEAD>Town Hoping to Cash in on Famous Ambush</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ARCADIA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arcadia is finally cashing in on Bonnie and
Clyde, 56 years after the outlaws were blown away in a police
ambush outside town.
   Visitors will stroll Barrow Boulevard, Trigger Trail and Ambush
Alley during a monthly flea market that begins here Sept. 14. The
three-day Bonnie &amp; Clyde Trade Days will include booths set up by
more than 500 dealers.
   ``We're not famous for anything else around here and the names
of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow are known nationwide,'' said
Lamar Ozley, a lawyer and investor in the project. ``We just hope
we can draw as many people as Bonnie and Clyde the day their bodies
were hauled into town.''
   About 20,000 people crowded Arcadia that day in 1934 after Clyde
Barrow and Bonnie Parker, low-life killers made into tragic heroes
by the Warren Beatty-Faye Dunaway movie, died in their tan 1934
Ford Deluxe in a hail of gunfire eight miles outside town.
   ``The mortuary was in the back end of a furniture store,'' said
William Dees, 83, whose father ran a nearby bank. ``I went in
there. The people actually tore up the furniture, standing on it,
walking on it to get a look at the bodies.''
   Arcadia has a population of about 3,000, but it had only 700
when Bonnie and Clyde died.
   Situated in north-central Louisiana, Arcadia was a good hideout
area for bandits in the 1930s. U.S. 80 was their interstate and
Bienville Parish was near the Arkansas line and about an hour's
drive from Texas for criminals who didn't care about speed limits.
   Four Texas lawmen had trailed Parker and Barrow through a
half-dozen states, finally getting a break when a Bienville Parish
farmer, Ivey Methvin, offered to set up an arrest in exchange for
dropping charges against his son, Henry. Henry ran with Bonnie and
Clyde.
   The Texans, joined by Bienville Parish Sheriff Henderson Jordan
and his deputy, Prentiss Oakley, hid by the side of Highway 154
near the Methvin farm on May 23, 1934. When the outlaws' auto came
by, the officer fired more than 100 rounds.
   ``Prentiss told me the ambush bothered him,'' recalled Homer
Oakley, brother of the late deputy. ``The fact is, if he ever drank
much before then, I didn't know about it. But after the ambush,
everybody knows he started drinking.''
   ``I think Prentiss and the sheriff aged overnight,'' said Hugh
Watson, retired chairman of Premier Bank in Shreveport. ``They were
never the same after that.''
   Watson, 17 at the time, said he worked in an Arcadia sandwich
shop and served Bonnie and Clyde the night before they were killed.
   ``We weren't busy so I sat on the curb while they sat in the car
and ate. We chatted. She asked if I had a comb. I got her one and
she combed her hair,'' he said. ``Both of them were polite,
ordinary looking, though she had kind of a coarse look.''
   Watson said he discovered their identities the next day when
their pictures appeared in The Shreveport Journal.
   ``People must have read the paper and heard it on the radio
because Arcadia filled up,'' he said. ``The car was hauled into
town with the bodies still inside. People were taking pieces off
the car for souvenirs.
   ``One girl I went to school with wound up with one of Bonnie's
shoes.''

   A woman who studied botany in college was
reported near death and in need of an emergency liver transplant
today after eating what doctors think were poisonous mushrooms.
   Roberta Rogala, 55, was in extremely critical condition at the
University of Chicago Hospitals, said spokesman John Easton.
   Doctors believe Mrs. Rogala and her husband, William, ate
poisonous mushrooms last week at their cottage in Dewey Lake, Mich.
   Mrs. Rogala, who studied botany in college, picked mushrooms and
cooked them to put on hamburgers, said her husband, who also got
sick but recovered.
   ``They were the purest white, pristine-looking mushrooms,''
Rogala said. ``I remember because she said to me, `Anything this
pure can't be bad.' ''
   Mrs. Rogala went into a coma Friday and doctors said had gone
into complete liver failure.
   ``She's a person who came name you 55 different plants by their
names, so I really just went along with her,'' Rogala said. ``It
doesn't matter at this point what it was _ the damage is done.
Right now, we need either a miracle or a liver transplant.''

   A red carpet is rolled up just inside
the main entrance of the hotel housing Kuwait's
government-in-exile, primed to be slapped across the glossy marble
for any passing head of state.
   The hotel near this mountain resort in southwestern Saudi Arabia
is home and headquarters for the deposed emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah, and the entire Cabinet.
   Nearly all senior government officials escaped when Iraq invaded
on Aug. 2.
   Visitors to the hotel about 50 miles east of Mecca have instant
access to a whole battery of ministers they probably could not have
reached by telephone in Kuwait before the invasion.
   ``You want three ministers in an exclusive interview?'' a
diplomat acting as a press liaison officer asks before presenting
the ministers of health, housing and municipal affairs for a
15-minute chat in the lobby.
   Most activity centers around an upstairs conference room on the
same floor as the emir's suite.
   Arabic wire service stories about Cabinet ministers on the road
and expressions of support for Kuwait are pasted across a bulletin
board outside the room.
   The one constant on the board is a photocopied newspaper picture
of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq hugging a detained child next
to one of Hitler in virtually the same pose. ``History Repeats
Itself!'' is scrawled under it with red felt marker.
   The television in the outer reception room is tuned to CNN.
   Press visits are easily arranged through an American public
relations firm that was hired after Saddam's frequent television
appearances convinced the Cabinet that their seclusion was losing
them the sound bite battle.
   Traffic into the Cabinet room can be fierce. Aides scurrying
between a battalion of facsimile machines jostle for space with
white-jacketed waiters pushing carts laden with crystal goblets and
plates of nuts.
   Everyone rises when a senior member of the royal al-Sabah family
passes, but otherwise there is little formality.
   A reporter conducting an interview in the Cabinet room is
interrupted when someone sticks his head in the door and tells him
he has a phone call.
   ``Go take it,'' says Planning Minister Suleiman Al-Muttawa.
``I'll be here.''
   But no one wants to be there for too long and they hope soon to
return to Kuwait, about 700 miles to the northeast.
   The ministers echo Al-Muttawa in saying, ``We're hoping it won't
extend even a period of months.''
   The spirit infects the whole building. Conversations that end at
lunch with ``Until next time in Kuwait'' are picked up again at
dinner.
   The Cabinet eats with everybody else, and both meals are
sumptuous affairs usually involving two whole sheep.
   Special food carts are wheeled into the suite of the emir, who
has appeared twice on television since the invasion but refuses all
interview requests and rarely emerges.
   A diplomat who met with him as part of his president's
delegation said, ``The emir was very much in despair, tired and
despondent. He kept saying, `You lost money but I have lost my
country.'''
   Cabinet ministers' days center around dealing with refugee
problems, trying to monitor events inside Kuwait and planning for
reconstruction.
   Derogatory nicknames for Saddam and the Iraqis creep into all
conversations, ranging from madman to ``the new Tatars,'' a
reference to the hordes that swept out of Asia in the 13th century
and pillaged culturally advanced Islamic cities.
   Cabinet members bristle at any reference to support for Saddam
from other Arab countries.
   ``We haven't come to power over the dead bodies of our
compatriots,'' stormed Al-Muttawa.
   The word Palestinian brings a grimace due to the Palestine
Liberation Organization's support for Baghdad.
   Al-Muttawa says there is a sense of ``shame and frustration''
among the ministers for having lost Kuwait's independence. Even
when they heard about the invasion they thought Iraq would stop
just inside the border and try to negotiate its land and oil
demands.
   But the ministers can also joke about their plight.
   When someone mentions a chronic lack of hotel rooms, one pipes
up: ``Delegate that to the housing minister.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American journalist Terry Anderson has
marked his 2,000th day in captivity with no new word on whether he
may be released soon.
   Anderson, 42-year-old chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, reached the grim milestone on Wednesday.
   He is among six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans and
one Italian held captive in Lebanon. Most are held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem militants.
   Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio, was kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut
on March 16, 1985, by Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
   The latest report on him came from former Irish hostage Brian
Keenan, who said after his release Aug. 24 that he had seen
Anderson during his four years in captivity.
   ``I saw Terry Anderson some time ago. He's in good form,''
Keenan said after he was freed by a group calling itself the
Organization of Islamic Dawn.
   The Irishman said he spent part of his time in captivity with
Anderson, noting they were in chains and blindfolded much of the
time.
   Keenan said Anderson ``appreciates the letters that he received
from his family. He has a picture of his daughter, Sulome, which is
some great companionship for him.''
   Sulome, Anderson's younger daughter, has never met her father.
She was born nearly three months after he was kidnapped.
   Lebanese newspapers have published several pictures and letters
from Sulome, her Lebanese mother, Madeleine, and the hostage's
sister, Peggy Say.
   In Dublin, the papal nuncio to Ireland pleaded with Iran's
outgoing ambassador on Wednesday to undertake all possible efforts
to obtain the release of the remaining Western hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I am certain that you will do all in your power to see that
innocent human beings, of no matter what nationality ... held
captive against their will, shall be enabled to regain the freedom,
the dignity to which they have a right,'' Archbishop Emmanuel
Gerada said during a farewell reception for Iranian Ambassador
Bahram Ghassemi.
   Ghassemi, who is taking up a post in the Iranian Foreign
Ministry, was widely credited with assisting in obtaining the
release of Keenan.
   Islamic Jihad and other Shiite kidnappers are linked to
Hezbollah, or Party of God. The fundamentalist movement is Iran's
main ally in Lebanon and is closely linked with radical figures in
Tehran.
   Apart from Keenan, two Swiss Red Cross workers held hostage in
south Lebanon were freed in early August.
   Islamic Dawn freed U.S. hostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed
10 days apart in April as a ``goodwill gesture.''
   But one of the kidnappers' reputed mentors said this week the
situation has changed and that no more Americans will be freed
because of the U.S. military intervention in the Persian Gulf in
response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``If there's going to be a hostage release, it will be Europeans
and not Americans,''' said Hussein Musawi, who heads a pro-Syrian
wing of Hezbollah. He had announced before Polhill and Reed were
freed that they would be released.
   ``The United States has spearheaded the West's occupation of
Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and that has
eliminated the chance of releasing American hostages in Lebanon
this year,'' he said.
   Musawi condemned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait but added: ``We don't believe that Saddam's aggression
should be confronted by an American occupation of our lands.''
   However, unconfirmed reports have indicated the Iraqi invasion
could indirectly speed up the release of all Western hostages.
   Witnesses who were in Kuwait during the invasion said 15
pro-Iranian terrorists convicted there in the 1983 bombing of the
U.S. and French embassies were seen fleeing the central prison.
   Islamic Jihad had demanded the release of the 15.
   A Shiite source who has close links with Hezbollah said two
Lebanese among the 15, believed to be the main focus of Islamic
Jihad's demands, have returned to Lebanon since the prison escape.
   The story has not been confirmed by the kidnappers or Hezbollah.
   Musawi said European hostages held in Lebanon ``would be in a
more favorable position than others.''
   Another Shiite source, who is familiar with Iran's situation,
said the U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf region would hinder
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's efforts to pressure the
kidnappers into releasing the six American captives. Rafsanjani
wants to improve Iran's relations with the West and faces
opposition by Iranian radicals.
   But Rafsanjani's internal power was consolidated last month when
Saddam, fearing for his vulnerable eastern flank with Iran, agreed
to withdraw his troops from areas occupied during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war, exchange prisoners-of-war and share sovereignty of
the Shatt-Al-arab waterway with Iran.
   This, and the apparent escape of the Kuwait 15, has raised
speculation that Iran will be better placed to arrange hostage
releases and that Anderson's kidnappers have got what they want.
   However, the Shiite source noted that ``with American soldiers
deployed in the gulf, Rafsanjani would have to think twice before
making any friendly gestures toward Washington.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will come to Japan
in April for the first visit by a Soviet leader, Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu said today.
   The timing of the long-awaited visit was set today during talks
between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Kaifu,
Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   ``I'd like to make it a good start of discussion on a peace
treaty and territorial issues,'' Kaifu was quoted by an aide as
saying.
   A visit by Gorbachev is further evidence of warming relations
between the two countries after a decades-long chill caused by a
dispute over islands off northern Japan seized by the Soviets near
the end of World War II.
   Moscow has rebuffed efforts by Japan to regain the islands.
   After a third and final round of talks today, Shevardnadze and
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama signed documents to lay the
groundwork for the visit.
   Their agreements also would facilitate Japanese technical
assistance for the ailing Soviet economy and aid for victims of the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
   For years, Japan has insisted that the small group of sparsely
populated islands must be returned before there could be any real
progress in economic or political ties. For its part, Moscow has
emphasized increased Japanese economic cooperation, particularly in
remote Siberia.
   But both sides now show a willingness to discuss a broad range
of cooperation while continuing their negotiations on the
territorial dispute.
   It was not immediately clear if any progress had been made on
the islands' issue during Shevardnadze's talks with Japanese
officials.
   After their first day of talks Wednesday, the foreign ministers
issued a joint statement calling for Iraq to withdraw immediately
from Kuwait and to release all foreigners being held in the two
Gulf nations.
   Nakayama urged the Soviets to begin a unilateral reduction of
troops in the Far East, as they have done in Eastern Europe, a
Japanese Foreign Ministry official said.
   But Shevardnadze ruled this out, saying troop reductions in the
Far East can be discussed only in the context of the overall
military balance in the region, said the official, who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Instead, Shevardnadze proposed a series of confidence-building
measures to improve ties, including exchanges of military personnel
and prior notification of large military exercises, the official
said.
   Nakayama said the two countries should instead focus on their
fundamental differences in order to reduce their ``wide gap,'' the
official added.

<HEAD>Lottery Winner Crushed to Death in Dumpster With Less Than $10</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who may have blown $188,000 in
lottery winnings on drink, limousine rides and real estate was
found crushed to death at a dump after apparently falling asleep in
a trash bin, police say.
   A pauper's burial was planned for Roy Clark, who detectives said
had less than $10 in his pockets when his body was discovered
Friday.
   ``Poof!'' sheriff's Detective Tom McCann said of the lottery
money. ``I guess he just blew it.''
   Clark's body was compacted by a garbage truck and found at the
Orange County dump after he earned $40 the day before as a day
laborer. Police could not locate any relatives.
   Clark, 39, won $188,000 in the Florida lottery last September.
Detectives said they have not been able to trace all his winnings
but know he spent some riding around in limousines and buying
rounds of drinks for friends.
   They said they also heard he invested in several businesses and
bought a condominium in Hawaii and land in California.
   Friends said Clark carried a picture of a girl he claimed was
his daughter, Brandy, a student at the University of New Mexico in
Albuquerque. But detectives found that no one named Brandy Clark
was registered as a student.
   Clark had worked for a sod company and lived at a Winter Park
apartment complex in 1989, when he befriended neighbors Chuck and
Sandy Herbert.
   He moved from the complex after he won the lottery and saw the
couple only occasionally until April, when he told them he was
having legal problems getting his lottery winnings and needed a
place to stay, the couple said.
   Clark lived with the Herberts and their three children. He
disappeared after telling the Herberts he would be gone for a few
days on a business trip with his lawyer to try to get his lottery
winnings, the couple said.
   The medical examiner determined that Clark suffocated. He had
alcohol in his system, but detectives don't know whether he was
drunk.

   Thieves used nylon string and fish hooks to
reel in at least $20,000 in cash, checks and food stamps from night
deposit boxes at three banks over the Labor Day weekend, police say.
   ``I still don't see how they could do it,'' Police Chief
Washington Long said. `I don't think they were amateurs.''
   The thefts, noticed when the banks reopened Tuesday, took an
even odder turn when authorities discovered some of the stolen
checks and food stamps dumped in night deposit boxes at two other
banks, Long said.
   The stolen goods were sealed in plastic bags filled with what
looked like vegetable oil. The oil made it difficult to lift
fingerprints, Long said.
   The police chief said more than one person probably carried out
the thefts, done with three-pronged hooks.
   ``I don't think one person would be out there fishing by himself
_ somebody else had to be watching,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Asked to Consider Moral Questions in Military Use of Dolphins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SILVERDALE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics are questioning the morality of
the Navy's plan to train naturally playful dolphins to guard
nuclear submarines.
   ``We are militarizing space ... and now we have the audacity to
think we can militarize animals. It is insane,'' Jeanne Clark of
Hempstead, N.Y., said at a hearing Wednesday night on the Navy's
plan to use as many as 16 dolphins to guard its Trident subs at
Bangor.
   Animal-rights activists protested military use of dolphins after
news reports in 1988, citing Navy records, said 13 dolphins in Navy
training had died from 1986 to 1988. Nearly half suffered from lack
of appetite or stomach ulcers. Other ailments included hepatitis
and pneumonia.
   The Navy recently reported that none of its 142 marine mammals
had died since June 1989.
   Animal-rights groups sued the Navy in April 1989, arguing that
bringing dolphins to Bangor required an environmental impact
statement under federal law. No dolphins are now at Bangor. Eight
Trident subs are stationed there.
   The groups dropped the lawsuit in May when the Navy agreed to
conduct the environmental review. The assessment is due next
summer; Wednesday night's hearing was on its scope.
   Laurie Raymond of the Progressive Animal Welfare Society in
Seattle said the assessment should consider scientific questions
such as the effects of stress and cold water on the warm-water
dolphins.
   Most speakers made more emotional arguments.
   ``We are polluting the moral environment,'' said the Rev.
Gretchen Woods of Kitsap Unitarian Universalist Association.
   Les Bivens, associate head of the biosciences division at the
Naval Ocean Systems Center in San Diego, said it would be difficult
to address moral questions in the impact statement.
   But he said, ``I do not think the people here have anything to
worry about whatsoever.'' A federal Marine Mammal Commission
investigation in 1989 found no major problems in the Navy's
dolphin-training program.
   In Boston, meanwhile, protests from animal-rights activists have
led an aquarium director to rethink plans to trade an aggressive,
unsociable show dolphin to the Navy.
   The New England Aquarium would have sent Rainbow, an 11-year-old
male, to the secret underwater mammal program at the San Diego
center.
   Aquarium director John H. Prescott said Wednesday he believed
the trade would be good for Rainbow. But he added, ``If it's
causing public concern, I must pay attention. It's not a closed
issue.''

   Visits to the morgue can be part of the
punishment for young drunken drivers under a law signed by Gov.

   Thompson approved legislation Wednesday that allows judges to
decide whether drunken drivers under age 21 should be forced to
visit morgues and hospitals to see the bodies of people killed in
alcohol-related accidents.
   ``It will leave a lasting impression on young offenders and

   Thompson also lowered the boom on owners of noisy car stereos.
He signed a law against playing stereos so loud that they can be
heard 75 feet from the car. Violators face a $50 fine.

<HEAD>Airline Industry Concerned About Rash of FAA Retirements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The airline industry says it is concerned
about a rash of retirements among key Federal Aviation
Administration personnel, including air traffic controllers.
   The Air Transport Association, which represents major carriers,
said Wednesday that the agency's loss of 341 people last month
jeopardizes the FAA's air traffic control and airways operations.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar confirmed the figure and said it was
twice the normal number of retirees for a month. He said the
increase was primarily because of concern over possible changes in
federal retirement rules.
   There are approximately 50,000 FAA employees.
   The Bush administration, in congressional budget negotiations,
has proposed eliminating a provision that allows employees to get
back their individual retirement contributions in two annual lump
sums.
   If the rules do change, only those who retired 30 days before
the program expires Sept. 30 would be eligible to get the lump-sum
payments.
   Farrar said it was too early to tell what impact stepped-up
retirements might have on the air control system.

<HEAD>Korean, Taiwanese, Hong Kong Imports Face U.S. Duty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will begin collecting
anti-dumping duties on synthetic sweaters imported from South
Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong as a result of a decision by the U.S.
International Trade Commission.
   The commission ruled in a 2-1 vote Wednesday that the imports
are sold at less than fair value, causing material damage to the
U.S. domestic industry.
   The decision means U.S. Customs will be ordered to charge duties
on the imported sweaters, the commission said. The announcement did
not give the rates of duty, which could bring a combination of
higher prices for the imports and reduced shipments.
   The finding was requested in a petition filed earlier this year
by the National Knitwear and Sportswear Association, a U.S.
industry group.
   The commission said imports accounted for 75 percent of the 14.9
million dozen manmade fiber sweaters purchased by U.S. consumers in
1989 and for 77.7 percent of total sweater purchases that year of
33.9 million dozen.
   South Korean synthetic sweaters led the 1989 imports with 37
percent of value and 3.75 million dozen sweaters, followed by
Taiwan with 31 percent and 3.1 million dozen and Hong Kong with 12
percent and 1.3 million dozen, it added.

<TEXT>
   Iraq will send Foreign Minister Tariz
Aziz and other officials to Iran on Sunday, the first such
high-level visit since war broke out between the two nations 10
years ago, the Iraqi News Agency reported today.
   The news agency did not provide any other details in the
one-sentence announcement.
   The visit was agreed to before Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait a
month ago. But thanks to concessions Iraq has since made, it will
aim to create the conditions for a direct meeting between Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and his Iranian counterpart, Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   Saddam has wanted such direct talks for years but Iran refused.
   But last month an increasingly isolated Saddam accepted Tehran's
demands for an Iraqi withdrawl from territory occupied in the
closing stages of the Iran-Iraq war, which ended in a cease-fire in
August 1988.
   The Iraq president also agreed to exchange all prisoners of war
and share the Shatt-al-Arab, the border waterway that provides Iraq
with its only access to the Persian Gulf. Iran had said direct
talks could begin only after Iraq accepted a 1975 treaty
establishing the Shatt-al-Arab as the boundary between the two
countries.
   No Iraqi foreign minister has visited Tehran since the Islamic
Revolution which ousted Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979.
   Iran has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but also has
criticized the deployment of the U.S.-led multinational force in
the Persian Gulf. It has also called for the removal of foreigners
from Saudi Arabia, the site of three of Islam's holiest sites, and
for an Arab solution to the conflict.
   Iran has said it would honor the U.N.-imposed embargo on trade
with Iraq along the countries' sommon 730-mile border.
   The Iraqi concessions also have strengthened Rafsanjani's hand
against radical opponents, diplomats in Tehran said in telephone
interviews. Rafsanjani has been locked in a power struggle with
hard-liners opposed to contact with the West.

<HEAD>Famous Ballroom Bans Disco After Utah Tourist Slain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At 71, Roseland still calls itself ``the home of
refined dancing.'' But since disco and hip-hop cut in on the
foxtrot and the cha-cha, trouble has also resided at the nation's
most famous ballroom.
   The mirrored lobby, which displays the shoes of the greats who
danced there and the names of spouses who met there, also has a
metal detector. And instead of taxi dancers, the ballroom now
employs a battalion of bouncers and guards.
   There have been two murders at Roseland in the past six years,
16 felonies in or around it this year and increasingly angry
complaints from neighborhood residents about late-night noise and
drug use outside the club.
   This week, opponents found a focus.
   A tourist from Utah was stabbed to death when a gang of youths
allegedly robbed his father and used the money for admission to the
ballroom. Later in the evening, in an unrelated incident, a man was
shot and wounded on the dance floor.
   On Wednesday, the club announced it would end disco programs by
the end of the month.
   ``Ballroom dancing is Roseland's heart and soul,'' said manager
Hilary Feshbach, who promised to find alternatives to disco to keep
the ballroom solvent.
   In the early evenings, Roseland is much the same as ever. Crowds
of mostly elderly men and women dance the foxtrot, the cha-cha and
other ballroom favorites. Their numbers have steadily declined and
about 10 years ago Roseland started a disco that opened at midnight
on Fridays and Saturdays after ballroom dancing ended.
   The late show has drawn roughly twice as many dancers as the
ballroom music, but it also attracted a younger, more intoxicated
and more violent crowd.
   Police Inspector Lowell Stahl calls the change after midnight
``like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.''
   The scene outside is even more troublesome.
   ``It's a nightmare,'' says Allan Abramowitz, who lives with his
wife and young son in an apartment building nearby. ``I invite you
to stay in my apartment any Friday or Saturday night between 2 a.m.
and 6 a.m. You'd hear the car boom boxes. I live on the 10th floor
and my windows shake from the bass.''
   It's a different kind of shaking than the kind for which
Roseland is famous.
   The ballroom's ``Hall of Fame'' displays shoes worn by Betty
Grable, George Raft, Gregory Hines and Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson.
A plaque bears the names of more than 725 couples who met and
married there.
   Roseland opened in a former carriage factory in 1919 and later
moved into a skating rink. Legend has it the owner, Louis Brecker,
needed a place to take his fiancee dancing that stayed open longer
than his native Philadelphia permitted.
   Brecker's Roseland was lively but orderly. House taxi dancers
partnered patrons for 10 cents a dance, but they couldn't accept
gifts from them. Jitterbuggers were discouraged from jittering too
frenetically. The twist was banned altogether.
   But styles of music and dance continued to change. Eventually,
Roseland gave in to disco in an attempt to cover vast overhead.
   ``We just couldn't fight it,'' said Nancy Brecker Leeds, the
founder's daughter who sold the place in 1981. ``It was all
around.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell for the
fourth consecutive day today, and the dollar sank further against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Exchange of 225 selected issues, which plunged
829.30 points Wednesday, fell 266.43 points, or 1.11 percent,
today, closing at 23,811.91. So far this week, it has shed 2,166.46
points, or 8.3 percent.
   Securities dealers said the market started in a buying mood
today following an overnight gain on Wall Street, but weakened
after reports that a U.S. citizen had been shot by Iraqi soldiers
in Kuwait while trying to avoid capture.
   ``The shooting report was a negative factor, but the market now
has become less sensitive to unfavorable factors'' related to the
Middle East crisis, said Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan
Securities Co. He said the day's loss in the index was moderate.
   The dollar closed at 141.65 yen, down 0.65 yen from its close
Wednesday, when it fell 1.75 yen.
   Today's close was the dollar's lowest since 141.55 yen on Oct.
25, 1989.
   After opening at 141.48 yen, it ranged between 141.35 yen and
142.45 yen.
   ``The dollar was bought back to the middle of the 142-yen level
when the shooting report circulated in the market, but the dollar
was under selling pressure by life insurance firms,'' said a dealer
with Sanwa Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The dealer said the dollar's retreat also resulted partly from
cross trading in which traders bought the yen for European
currencies such as Swiss francs and West German marks.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond closed at 8.245 percent, up from
Wednesday's close of 8.180 percent. The price slid to 82.48 points
from 82.76.

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnam-backed government
has welcomed a U.S. offer to meet and discuss ending nearly 20
years of civil war, but it is unlikely to yield easily on
relinquishing power to a U.N. administration.
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, talks scheduled for today involving the
Cambodian government of Premier Hun Sen and representatives of its
guerrilla foes failed to get off the ground as the parties bickered
over who should sit at the table. Secretary of State James Baker
III told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that
U.S.-Cambodian talks would be held in the Laotian capital of
Vientiane.
   He called it ``the next logical step'' in U.S. support for peace
efforts.
   U.S. diplomats in Bangkok say no date has been set for the
meeting.
   A Cambodian official today called it ``another step forward in
the solution of the Cambodian problem.'' Hor Nam Hong, minister
responsible for external affairs on Phnom Penh's council of
ministers, spoke to reporters in Jakarta.
   Washington backs the non-communist resistance forces of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk and of Son Sann, who are allied with the
Chyinese-backed communist Khmer Rouge.
   The three forcea are battling the government Vietnam installed
in Phnom Penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled the Khmer
Rouge, which had during a nearly four-year rule tried to transform
Cambodia into a radical agrarian commune, sending nearly 1 million
people to their deaths.
   Plans for the talks in Jakarta were on the verge of total
collapse earlier in the week after key figures threatened not to
come, and the meeting did not begin as scheduled today.
   But Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, today said his
father would come to Jakarta on Sunday. In reponse, Hor Nam Hong
said the premier now plans to arrive Friday.
   The feared Khmer Rouge, the strongest rebel group on the
battlefield, had threatened to boycott the talks if Hun Sen and
Sihanouk did not attend.
   The talks were expected to focus on formation of a transitional
government to govern while elections are organized. Each of the
four Cambodian factions is supposed to be represented on the
council.
   On Aug. 28, the United States and the other permanent members of
the U.N. Security Council _ Britain, China, France and the Soviet
Union _ adopted a Cambodian peace plan under which the world body
would hold interim authority and disarm and regroup the four armies.
   But while Phnom Penh welcomed a major U.N. role, President Heng
Samrin said again last week that his intention was ``to maintain
the status quo _ both politically and militarily.''
   Richard Solomon, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Asian
affairs, expressed disappointment last week when asked if U.S.
officials had succeeded in getting the Vietnamese to persuade Phnom
Penh to back the U.N. plan.
   U.S. and Vietnamese officials met at the United Nations on
Friday in their second round of talks on the Cambodian conflict.
   Solomon said the Vietnamese still want the armies to remain in
place and Phnom Penh to hold interim authority.

   A man told police he helped his
cancer-stricken wife commit suicide by tying a plastic bag over her
head to asphyxiate her, fearing painkillers she had taken wouldn't
kill her.
   Bertram Harper's taped statement to a detective was played in a
courtroom Wednesday during a hearing to determine whether he should
be charged in the Aug. 19 death of his wife, Virginia.
   ``I helped my wife carry out her wishes. That's all I've done,''
the 72-year-old California man later told reporters.
   Harper said once his wife lost consciousness in their motel room
after taking about a dozen painkillers, he pulled the bag over her
head and tied it around her neck with rubber bands knotted
together. He said he waited about an hour to make sure she was
dead, then called Romulus police.
   The 30-minute audio tape of Harper's police statement was played
during a preliminary hearing on whether sufficient evidence exists
to try Harper on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder.
   Harper described to police his wife's cancer and their earlier
commitment to end each other's suffering if necessary. The couple
chose to do that in Michigan because they understood the state has
no law against helping someone commit suicide, Harper said.
   Harper told police his wife washed down the pills with coffee
liqueur and lay on the bed while she pulled a clear plastic bag
over her head. He said they removed the bag when she complained it
was too hot.
   Harper said they tried to put the bag over her head twice more,
but she kept moving her hands and head. Harper said he secured the
bag over his wife's head only after she lost consciousness.
   ``If I hadn't placed the bag, I don't know what would have
happened,'' Harper said on the tape. ``Eventually she probably
would _ perhaps come out ... of the sleeping pills, but then she'd
have been back to square one _ she'd have been back in pain.''
   A deputy Wayne County coroner, Sawait Kanluen, testified that
Mrs. Harper died of asphyxiation.
   Kanluen said she had liver cancer but neither that nor drugs she
had taken in the suicide attempt killed her.
   Harper's lawyer, Hugh Davis, denied to reporters that the couple
came to Michigan to carry out their death pact because of the case
of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who helped an Oregon woman commit suicide in
a Detroit suburb on June 4.
   Kevorkian has not been charged. Prosecutors continue to
investigate.
   Harper said he and his wife learned from a book by Derek
Humphry, executive director of the Hemlock Society, that Michigan
has no law against helping someone commit suicide.
   The Hemlock Society is an organization advocating the right of
terminally ill people to end their lives when and as they choose.
The society is financing Harper's defense.
   Harper was jailed for a week before a bail bondsman he never met
posted his $25,000 bond. District Judge Henry Zaborowski adjourned
the preliminary hearing until Friday.

   Mostly dry weather prevailed across the nation early today and
no relief was in sight from heat in the Plains and the South.
   Scattered thunderstorms were forecast for today in those areas,
but oppressive heat was expected to persist. Temperatures were
likely to soar into the 100s.
   Scattered rain was forecast for the Rockies, parts of the
Midwest and New England.
   Dry, hot weather was expected in the Pacific Northwest. Inland
temperatures were expected to soar into the 90s.
   A cold front pushing across Montana, the Dakotas, Minnesota and
Wisconsin was likely to hit the Great Lakes today.
   The high Wednesday in the Lower 48 states was 106 degrees in

<HEAD>10-Year Study Concludes Acid Rain a Problem, Not Crisis</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 2nd graf to CORRECT Thursday to Wednesday</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   After a decade of study, a scientific review
concludes that acid rain is ``a long term problem'' requiring
tougher pollution controls but is not an environmental crisis.
   Nevertheless, the report released Wednesday by the National Acid
Precipitation Assessment Program said steep cuts in sulfur dioxide
emissions, especially from Midwest electric utilities, will be
needed to reverse the environmental damage of acid rain.
   The report made no recommendation on how steep or how soon the
reductions should be made. It said a cut of 10 million tons of
annual sulfur dioxide emissions would result in the recovery of
highly acidic lakes and reverse other environmentally damaging
conditions.
   Legislation nearing approval in Congress calls for utilities to
cut annual sulfur dioxide releases by 10 million tons, or roughly
in half, by the end of the decade,
   The National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program was
established by Congress in 1980 to improve understanding of acid
rain. It spent $537 million to conduct its decade of study.
   The scientific group's report was embraced by both those who are
supporting steep cuts in sulfur dioxide emissions as well as
critics of such cuts.
   The critics contend that severe pollution controls costing as
much as $5 billion a year is an overreaction to the extent of the
acid rain problem.
   ``The report provides strong evidence that there is time to
implement more cost effective ways in which to mitigate the limited
environmental impacts of acid rain,'' said Richard Lawson,
president of the National Coal Association.
   He maintained the findings show that acid rain ``does not pose
an environmental emergency.''
   Thomas Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, said
the findings ``point out that the damage from acid rain is much
less than was feared in the late 1970s and early 1980s.''
   But Eileen Claussen, a senior director involved with air
pollution issues at the Environmental Protection Agency, said the
report ``clearly establishes the link between (sulfur) emissions
and environmental damage'' and supports the Bush administration's
call for tough pollution controls by coal-burning electric
utilities.
   The report acknowledged that acid rain is affecting visibility
across much of the East, causes damage to some forests, reduces
soil nutrients, kills some aquatic life, erodes buildings and
statutes, and can pose health problems to some humans.
   It said that acid rain has shown to be most damaging to aquatic
systems in the Adirondacks of New York State where 14 percent of
large lakes and nearly a third of the smaller ones were highly
acidic. Less of a problem was found elsewhere along the
mid-Atlantic region and New England.
   James Mahoney, director of the group that conducted the study,
outlined the draft report to a final meeting of the group and said
its findings have ``reduced the scientific uncertainties'' about
acid rain.
   ``Acid rain is correctly viewed as a long-term problem which
should be resolved by permanent measures,'' he said.
   Mahoney said that while the study supports many of the
scientific views expressed over the years on acid rain it also
rejected other ``more extreme views'' such as those who consider it
``a flat-out crisis'' or those ``who would say there's no problem
at all.''

<HEAD>Rights Group Says Death Squads Killing A Child A Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said today that death squads
formed to fight lawlessness in Brazilian streets are killing
children at a rate of about one a day.
   The worldwide human rights group said an increasing number of
homeless children are turning to crime to survive, leading to an
increase in murders by death squads partly manned by off-duty
policemen.
   In a report released today, the group spoke of hundreds of such
killings and said there were also many cases of children being
beaten, tortured and mutilated by policemen on duty.
   It cited Brazilian rights groups for the estimate of a death a
day.
   The organization reminded president Fernando Collor de Mello of
his pledge June 22 to stamp out the abuses. He said: ``We cannot be
and will not again be a country cited as violent in reports by
Amnesty International.''
   It said an Amnesty delegation met Collor last month and asked
for ``immediate, concrete action'' to stop the killings.
   The report cited the case of three boys picked up in Rio de
Janeiro by military police last month on suspicion of trying to
break into a store. It said they were made to play Russian
roulette, and a 13-year-old, Leandro Cardoso da Silva, was shot
``in the head and dumped outside a hotel by police. He later died
in hospital.''
   ``Poor children in Brazil are treated with contempt by the
authorities, risking their lives simply by being on the street,''
the report said. ``Their most basic rights are trampled on by the
very people who should safeguard them.''
   It said the death squads kill children to clean up the streets,
remove witnesses or keep an area safe. ``On-duty police officers
have shot youths dead simply for failing to stop their motorcycle
when signaled to do so or for allegedly insulting a police
officer.''
   It said that while some officers and judges deplore the abuses,
``the authorities have generally failed to take action.'' The few
cases that are properly investigated ``often take years to go to
trial and result in negligible sentences.
   ``Police are sometimes slow to intervene to stop death squad
abductions as they are taking place. When two boys were taken from
their home by armed men claiming to be police, other officers in a
patrol car refused the mother's request to search for the boys.
They were later found dead.''
   The report said young people on the streets or in detention are
routinely tortured and ill-treated by police. It said the police
use electric shocks, burn children with cigarettes, throw hot water
on them and beat them with truncheons.

   He died at Newport Hospital in Rhode Island.
   After more than 25 years in the federal government, Green
resigned in 1970 to run for Congress from Rhode Island as a
Republican.
   After losing, he returned to Washington, working for the
Environmental Protection Agency from 1971 to 1977, and again from

<HEAD>Fed Says Citibank Can't Sell Insurance Despite Delaware Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board has ordered Citicorp
to close its insurance operations in Delaware in a decision
analysts say casts serious doubt on the ability of banks to expand
into the insurance business.
   The decision, announced by the Fed on Wednesday, involves Family
Guardian Life Insurance Co., a company controlled by Citicorp's
wholly-owned Citibank of Delaware.
   The Fed announcement noted that Family Guardian was acting under
a new Delaware law that permits state chartered banks in Delaware
to ``conduct broad insurance agency and underwriting activities
through a separate department or division of the bank or through a
subsidiary of the bank.''
   However, the Fed said it determined that ``these activities were
not consistent with the board's regulation'' governing bank holding
companies such as Citicorp.
   The Delaware law that took effect in May capped years of debate
and lobbying by the banking and insurance industries and quickly
led to the establishment of insurance operations by a number of
leading banks in Delaware.
   The Fed decision, similar to one involving South Dakota several
years ago, is in line with the insurance industry arguments that
state laws are pre-empted by the Federal Bank Holding Company Act
that does not allow a subsidiary of a bank holding company to
engage in a business that the parent company is not allowed to
engage in.

   Nineteen paintings worth more than $2
million, including works by Picasso and Renoir, were stolen by
thieves who lowered themselves into a 5th-floor apartment by rope,
police said today.
   Police said there was no burglar alarm system in the studio
apartment in Cannes, owned by a former government official and used
by his 30-year-old son, who works as a night watchman.
   The son, Armand Schwarz-Fuchs, discovered the theft when he
returned from work early Wednesday, police said.
   Among the works reported stolen were paintings by 19th and 20th
century masters Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas,
Amedeo Modigliani and Edouard Manet.
   Officials initially estimated the value of the stolen paintings
at nearly $2 million, but police said today that the value was
likely to be much higher.
   French press reports suggested there was uncertainty as to the
origin of the paintings, and police said they wanted to talk with
the apartment's owner, Jacques Schwarz-Fuchs, 62.
   A retired member of the Council of State, Schwarz-Fuchs
reportedly is ill and receiving medical care in the eastern city of
Strasbourg.
   According to police, the thieves broke through a balcony window
of the apartment in Cannes after lowering themselves by rope from
the roof, two floors above.
   There have been several major thefts of privately owned art
works in the past two years in Cannes and nearby Nice.
   In December, eight oil paintings by Henri Matisse, valued at
more than $12 million, were stolen from a Nice apartment. The works
were recovered in January, and a suspect was sentenced to three
years in prison.

<TEXT>
   NASA engineers, embarrassed again by
a space shuttle that can't fly, set off anew today on a hunt
through a tangle of pipes for an elusive fuel leak that grounded
Columbia for a third time.
   ``It is a real booger to try to find and isolate,'' shuttle boss
Robert Crippen said after the mission was scrubbed Wednesday, 7{
hours before Columbia was to have lifted off at 1:20 a.m. today
with the $150 million Astro observatory.
   Engineers worked on a troubleshooting plan through the night,
but Crippen said that even if the hole is found immediately,
Columbia could not leave on its long astronomy mission for at least
three or four days and probably longer.
   ``We've got pretty good test data from what we did during the
tanking and detanking of the fuel tank,'' NASA spokesman George
Diller said this morning, referring to Wednesday's pouring of
hydrogen into the half-million-gallon fuel tank.
   ``We've been looking at it all night and we will have some
educated guesses later in the afternoon,'' he said.
   Because there are some propellants still on board, repair crews
will not be able to enter the tail section of the orbiter until
late afternoon, he said. At that time, NASA has scheduled a
briefing for reporters by administrator Richard Truly and the top
man in the agency's space flight program, William Lenoir.
   The launch would have been the 36th shuttle flight and the first
in four months after a summer of similar leaks for NASA. That is
the longest gap between missions since flights resumed following
the Challenger disaster.
   NASA thought it had cured Columbia of leaks by installing new
plumbing between the orbiter and its huge tank. Crippen said the
leak that forced the first launch postponement, in May, was gone,
but another leak appeared Wednesday inside the rear compartment.
   ``I think this leak has been there all along,'' he said.
``Trying to isolate it out from the other leak ... confused the
data.''
   ``My first reaction was frustration,'' said program scientist Ed
Weiler. ``But my next thought was, `My God, I'm glad they stopped,
some of my friends are aboard.' '' Hydrogen is highly combustiblle.
   The seven Columbia crewmen left for their training base in
Houston at dawn.
   ``We will be ready when Columbia is fixed,'' said commander
Vance Brand.
   The shuttle's rear compartment is a maze of pipes, pumps and
valves that feed three huge engines, which push the shuttle into
orbit once its booster rockets are spent.
   ``We do not consider that the vehicle is safe to fly,'' Crippen
said.
   It was the second scrub in less than a week. Last Thursday, a
day before the scheduled launch, launch control found that it could
not communicate with one of the four telescopes in Columbia's cargo
bay. That problem was fixed over the weekend.
   The telescopes, designed to study stars, galaxies and other hot
objects, was supposed to have gone up in a shuttle in March 1986,
but all flights were postponed because of the Challenger disaster
two months earlier.
   Columbia must be on its way by Sept. 14 or face yet another
delay. The shuttle Discovery, on a neighboring launch pad, has
priority for a flight that must take place between Oct. 5 and Oct.
23 to send a probe winging toward orbit around the sun. The
alignment of planets for that mission won't be right again for 13
months.
   Wednesday's countdown was stopped as technicians noticed an
alarming buildup of hydrogen while the fuel was pouring into the
shuttle tank at the rate of 8,400 gallons a minute.
   The concentration of hydrogen was 10 times over the limit when
officials called a halt. They continued filling the tank, trying
without success to isolate the leak.
   The problem is another in a series that began with the launch of
the Hubble Space Telescope in April. The $1.5 billion telescope was
supposed to see to the beginning of the universe; instead, it needs
corrective lenses that can't be put on by astronauts until 1993.
   In May, the Columbia leak was discovered during fueling and the
shuttle was trundled back to its hangar for tests and a new
connecting pipe. The old one was found to be contaminated with tiny
glass beads that made a path for leaking gas.
   In June, a fueling test on sister ship Atlantis showed it, too,
had holes and the entire three-shuttle fleet was grounded.
   Last month, the Magellan space probe went into orbit around
Venus after a 158-million-mile trip that began in May 1989. The
euphoria was dampened when engineers twice lost touch with the
probe. They said Wednesday that Magellan will start mapping the
surface of Venus later this month _ even if they don't figure out
the communications blackouts.
   Vice President Dan Quayle alluded to NASA's problems a few hours
before the scrub in a televised speech to NASA employees from the
Johnson Space Center in Texas. He said the space agency is up to
doing the job it was assigned to do.
   ``Take it from a guy who knows a lot about unwarranted
criticism,'' he said. ``Once they pile it on, they just don't know
when to stop.''

<HEAD>Israel Says United States Will Supply Patriot Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister David Levy said today the
United States will supply Israel with Patriot anti-ballistic
missiles and other advanced weapons it requested in light of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Israel has asked Washington to bolster the Israeli military,
maintaining that it faces dangers from Iraq and from new American
arms being supplied to other Arab nations still technically at war
with the Jewish state.
   Levy, who is in Washington, was interviewed on Israel radio
today, a day after meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   He said the United States agreed to meet Israel's request that
it be supplied with additional weapons to maintain army superiority
over its neighbors in the Middle East.
   ``Israel's qualitative edge is not only a basic American
principle, but will be ensured by supplying Israel with all it
needs to assure this superiority,'' Levy told Israel.
   He added that as part of the agreement, Israel would receive the
Patriot anti-ballistic missile.
   In the gulf crisis, the United States has deployed Patriot
missiles in Saudi Arabia to reinforce U.S. positions near the
Kuwaiti border. The United States began its buildup of forces in
Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Levy did not mention other specific weapons Israel had
requested. The Israeli daily Maariv reported earlier this week that
the government also asked for more F-16 jet fighters and Apache
anti-tank helicopters than the United States earlier pledged to
supply.
   The Defense Ministry said Thursday it had no information on the
Patriot agreement. It has refused to discuss specific requests for
U.S. arms, saying Israel does not disclose weapons transactions.
   U.S. officials made no announcement on the reported arms
agreement.
   Israel receives $1.8 billion in U.S. military aid annually, more
than any other country. Israel also gets $1.2 billion in other
assistance, making it the largest recipient of U.S. aid overall.

   President Saddam Hussein today offered to
televise comments by President Bush to the Iraqi public.
   He made the proposal in response to U.S. officials' complaints
about the extensive air time given the Iraqi president in the West.
   Naji al-Hadithi, the director general of the Information
Ministry, said he had received the instructions from Saddam and
that an Iraqi television crew was ready to go to Washington to
conduct an interview with Bush.
   He said the order was given so that Bush ``will have access to
Iraqi public opinion.''
   Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jasim told the Iraqi News
Agency: ``The U.S. president has said that President Saddam Hussein
has been fortunate to have the opportunity to address the American
people and that he also would like to present his viewpoint to the
Iraqis.''
   The Bush administration reportedly has grown to hate what it
calls the ``Saddamathons'' on CNN. The Atlanta-based network,
carried by satellite around the world, has devoted hours of air
time to Saddam's speeches, informal news conferences and a meeting
with Western detainees.
   The other American networks also have given extensive coverage
to Saddam since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 prompted the
United States to send forces to Saudi Arabia.
   The interview with Bush would be unprecedented on Iraqi TV, a
state-owned network that broadcasts a total of 14 hours each day on
two channels.
   Baghdad television broadcasts interviews with Iraqi officials
and, infrequently, with foreign dignitaries visiting Baghdad. It
has never carried an interview with a foreign leader conducted
abroad.
   Since the crisis started, Iraq's official media has carried
extensive articles, commentaries, editorials and broadcast reports
critical of the United States, the deployment of the U.S.
multinational force and of Bush personally.
   Cartoons depicting Bush in a variety of guises and situations
have become extremely popular in Iraq.
   Iraq's government daily Al-Jumhuriya today carried a cartoon
showing Bush in an Arabic robe and headdress under the caption,
``Emir Bush.''

   Rep. Tommy Robinson criticized the
legal system after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a stay of
execution for a convicted murderer who contends Robinson beat a
confession out of him while sheriff.
   ``These legal maneuvers could go on for years,'' Robinson said
in a statement issued through a spokesman, Rex Nelson.
   ``The time has come for Congress to limit the number of appeals
that can be filed by those on death rows across the country,'' he
said.
   Barry Lee Fairchild, 36, was spared execution by injection
Wednesday when the high court declined to lift a stay granted the
day before by a federal appeals court.
   Fairchild was convicted in the 1983 slaying of Air Force nurse
Marjorie Mason.
   Also Wednesday, the FBI confirmed it was investigating reports
of civil rights abuse by the Pulaski County sheriff's office, which
Robinson headed when Fairchild was arrested.
   The FBI wouldn't say if the investigation covered the period
when Robinson was sheriff.
   Fairchild's attorneys have contended in appeals that he was
beaten into confessing by Robinson and his deputies. Robinson, a
Republican, denies the allegations.
   ``I am tired of attorneys who waste a court's time and waste our
tax money,'' Robinson said in the statement. ``I also am tired of
groups that try to make heroes of convicted murderers and rapists.
The rights of Barry Lee Fairchild were never violated.''
   Robinson said he would work in the closing days of the
congressional session for passage of a bill limiting federal court
appeals. His tenure in Congress ends in January because he chose to
run for governor instead of for re-election.
   Robinson lost the GOP gubernatorial primary in May.
   A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ordered U.S. District Judge G. Thomas Eisele to look at new
evidence presented by Fairchild's attorneys.
   Among the evidence are affidavits from four black men who claim
they were accused of Ms. Mason's slaying and were beaten by
Robinson or his deputies.
   Eisele said he will consider the new evidence Nov. 13.
   Assistant Attorney General Jack Gillean said three of the four
men who submitted affidavits were suspects in the 1983 murder. He
said police questioned the men days before Fairchild was arrested
and questioned.
   Hall said the existence of the other suspects wasn't revealed to
the lawyer for Fairchild at his trial, Joe O'Bryan. Such
information could have helped convince the jury that ``police
rounded up blacks and beat on them until they elected which one was
the best one to be charged,'' Hall said.
   Gillean said he was told by the Pulaski County sheriff's office
that the information about the three suspects was in the department
case file and has no reason to believe it was withheld.
   O'Bryan said he hadn't known at the time of any other witnesses
who might testify about coercion.

   Hot firefighters have a cool respite from
battle against major summer blazes thanks to the ``good neighbor
policy'' of a bus agency.
   The Port Authority of Allegheny County has provided firefighters
with air conditioned buses at the scenes of large summer fires for
five years.
   The authority provides the buses six to 10 times each summer as
part of a ``good neighbor policy'' with police and fire
departments, Fincke said.
   ``We rely on the police heavily for help in traffic control, for
security measures,'' he said. ``We try to help them when we can.''
   Firefighters are grateful.
   ``When you come out of a building that's maybe a couple hundred
degrees on the inside, if it's hot outside, you don't get much
relief,'' firefighter Robert Walker said. ``If you go in the bus,
you can cool down quite a bit.''

   The usually raucous ride to the mess
hall was quieter this noon as Sgt. Williams' words sank in.
   ``We don't have time for any attitudes,'' he told his men, all
neighbors from around Allendale, S.C. ``An attitude is going to get
people hurt when we're over there. We're on the same team and it's
time to act like a team.''
   The short lecture before lunch was just another sign that things
are getting serious for the 14 members of the 265th Quartermaster
Detachment.
   The water purification unit from the South Carolina National
Guard trained hard this past week for deployment to the Mideast.
But now the pace is even harder.
   The men go about the day's activities wearing gas mask packs and
web gear to get used to the weight. Their forest-patterned battle
dress fatigues have been exchanged for desert camouflage.
   Every early morning session of PT _ physical training _ sees
more miles run, a subject of mild grumbling among the unit, where
the average age is 35.
   ``If Saddam Hussein was chasing your ass across the desert you'd
all do another five miles,'' chided Capt. Robert Appiah, the
regular Army officer preparing the men for overseas.
   Every night goes a little later as the 265th commander, Sgt.
Ronnie Jackson, pushes his men to practice radio communications,
chemical protection and field operations.
   For Williams, the second in command, it is a question of
survival.
   Called John by his men and his superiors, the usually smiling
non-commissioned officer has been less cheerful these last few days.
   ``You realize what could happen and it makes you more serious,''
said the 42-year-old father of three.
   Williams, a computer programmer, is the only member of the unit
who experienced combat. He has shrapnel scars in his back to remind
him of the ambushes and firefights in Vietnam. They give him an
appreciation of training and teamwork.
   ``I could get knocked off or Ronnie could get knocked off, so
it's important that everybody learn to do every job,'' he said in
his soft voice. ``You've got to look at every man as the one who
might have to take over.''
   The push to get ready has had its casualties. For Spc. Henry
Harris, the 51-year-old retired teacher, it was sore knees. Sgt.
Bill Bostick, 42, has a bad back. Sgt. Earnest Deloach reinjured a
hamstring. All three were given light duty after being forced to
report to sick call.
   The three went reluctantly, fearing they might be sent home.
   ``There was no way I was going to go if that was the case,''
said the 38-year-old Deloach.
   After giving blood for an AIDS test, a requirement of all troops
facing deployment, Spc. Ulysses Calhoun stretched out on a couch
and suggested he might need a long rest. Someone asked if he would
like cookies and juice.
   ``No,'' said Calhoun, ``I believe a big T-bone and a 12-pack
will fix up my blood just right.''
   Still, for every light moment there is a reminder of the future.
After lunch the 265th joined hundreds of reservists for a general
briefing at the post's movie theater. When it ended the unit was
asked to stay for a briefing on Saudi Arabia.
   The reservists filed out, some stopping to wish the unit luck.
The 265th quickly found itself a lonely island of olive drab in a
sea of red chairs.
   ``Damn,'' said Spc. Willie Badger, looking around the empty
theater. ``All these people and we're the only ones going?''

   About 5,000 gallons of heavy heating
oil spilled early this morning into a creek that feeds the
spill-plagued waterway known as Arthur Kill, the Coast Guard said
today.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer David Cook said a 6 million-gallon
storage tank collapsed around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Hess Oil
terminal on the shores of the waterway in Perth Amboy. Nearly all
of the No. 6 heating oil was contained in dikes, but about 5,000
gallons overflowed at 1 a.m. into Woodbridge Creek, Cook said.
   The creek, which Cook said is not navigable, has been
double-boomed to keep the oil from reaching the Arthur Kill.
   Cook said the Coast Guard is investigating why the storage tank
collapsed. The overflow has been stopped, but oil still remains on
the ground and is being pumped into other tanks, he said.
   More than 1 million gallons of oil have spilled into the Arthur
Kill and the nearby Kill Van Kull this year, including a
570,000-gallon spill from an Exxon refinery in Linden, N.J., into
the Arthur Kill on Jan. 2.
   The Arthur Kill, a widely used shipping channel, separates
Staten Island, N.Y., and New Jersey. Kill is an old Dutch word for
stream.

   President Roh Tae-woo told North
Korea's Prime Minister today during a historic meeting that he
hoped for a summit soon that could set the stage for Korean
unification before the end of the century.
   ``Korea cannot remain the last divided nation on earth,
separated by Cold War,'' Roh said.
   The two countries' prime ministers wound up two days of formal
talks today without any major agreements, but Seoul officials said
privately they were not displeased. South Korea's goal had been to
open up dialogue with the communist North.
   Another round of discussions between the two nations is
scheduled for Oct. 16-19 in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
   Roh's meeting with Prime Minister Yon Hyong Muk marked the first
time a leader of South Korea has received an official
representative of the rival North Korean government.
   ``To effectively solve pending issues between the South and the
North, the top leaders of both sides should meet as soon as
possible and set the framework for mutual cooperation,'' Roh said,
according to an aide.
   The meeting was the climax of talks between the two Korea's
prime ministers on easing political and military tensions _
discussions at the highest level between the rival states since the
division of the peninsula in 1945.
   ``The first prime ministers meeting in 45 years should be a
starting point for unification,'' Roh said. ``To achieve
unification in this century, authorities of South and North Korea
should continue dialogue and open the way for unification.''
   With South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon also attending,
Roh met the North Korean prime minister for about 20 minutes, said
Lee Soo-jung, spokesman for the president. Afterwards, Roh spoke
with six other North Korean delegates and three of their aides.
   Meanwhile, sporatic protests were staged to coincide with the
meetings. Some of the protests demanded the withdrawal of 43,000
U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, saying their presence hinders
dialogue on unification.
   About two dozen radical students unfurled a unification banner
and tossed anti-American leaflets outside a hotel where South
Korean political leaders held a dinner. Eight people were arrested.
   About 500 radical students yelling anti-U.S. and anti-government
slogans clashed with police outside Seoul's Kunkuk University. At
Cheju University in southern Korea, about 300 students fought
police with firebombs for an hour protesting anti-communist
security laws, news reports said.
   In southern Kwangju city, students burned an American flag in
front of a U.S. Air Force facility, according to news reports.
   Earlier in the day, five dissidents were arrested when they
tried to enter the hotel where the meetings were held. They wanted
to deliver a letter to the premiers.
   One of the five was the wife of Suh Kyung-won, a former
opposition legislator sentenced to prison for 10 years illegally
visiting North Korea.
   In the final meeting, North Korea reiterated its demands that
South Korea release jailed dissidents, halt a joint U.S. military
exercise and stop efforts to seek its own seat in the United
Nations, said an official speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Joongang Daily News said South Korea had offered to discuss
the three issues if certain conditions were met, but that North
Korea did not immediately accept.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified officials as saying South
Korea offered to consider a suspension of the Team Spirit military
exercise with U.S. forces if North Korea was willing to remove
offensive forces along the heavily armed Korean border.
   The newspaper also said South Korea agreed to consider releasing
dissidents jailed for traveling illegally to the north if the north
agreed to sign accords permitting travel, mail and transportation
between the two nations.
   The paper said South Korea had offered to delay applying for
U.N. membership, a major point of contention.
   Both nations, each claiming to represent the entire peninsula,
have permanent observer status at the United Nations.

   Most Americans would flunk a test of basic
knowledge about sex, says a new survey that's old news to sex
experts.
   Fifty-five percent of people surveyed could not get at least 10
of the 18 questions right in the test, designed by the Kinsey
Institute.
   Half didn't know that a woman can become pregnant while having
her period, the report said. Half also did not know that oil-based
lubricants, like petroleum jelly, shouldn't be used with condoms or
diaphragms. Such substances can erode microscopic holes in condoms
or diaphragms, the Kinsey report said.
   Half the respondents incorrectly believed anal intercourse
itself can cause AIDS, even if neither partner is infected by the
virus; nearly 30 percent incorrectly said that menopause causes
most women to lose interest in sex; and only 35 percent knew that
problems with achieving erections usually begin with physical
causes.
   ``I'm not surprised at all'' by the poor showing, Virginia
Johnson Masters, director of the Masters &amp; Johnson Institute in St.
Louis, said in a telephone interview.
   She said people just do not seem to absorb factual information
they hear about sex, unless a sex-related problem affects them or a
family member or friend, or they are health professionals who deal
with sexual problems, or they have a good understanding of sexual
function and behavior.
   The results also made sense to Debra Haffner, executive director
of the Sex Information and Education Council of the U.S., a
nonprofit organization that promotes sex education.
   The group ``believes that until there is comprehensive sexuality
education for all people from childhood through adulthood, that we
will continue to see this alarming degree of sexual ignorance that
causes both personal pain as well as significant disease and
dysfunction,'' she said.
   Kinsey institute director June Reinisch said Wednesday the
questions were drawn from those most often asked of the institute.
They represent facts that ``people need to know for both their
physical health and their mental health,'' she said.
   Nearly every question ``affects people's feelings about
themselves, their self-esteem,'' she said. A recurring theme in
questions asked of her, she said, is ``Am I normal? ... The reason
we don't know what's normal is that we're not taught what's going
on.''
   Among the poll's other findings: Only about 25 percent knew that
the typical American has first intercourse at age 16 to 17, or that
an estimated 30 percent to 40 percent of married men have had an
extramarital affair.
   And only 21 percent knew that more than a quarter of American
men have had a sexual experience with another male as a teen-ager
or adult.
   Poll results emphasize a need for sex education of pre-teen
children and of medical school students, because the poll found
people turn to doctors for sex information, Reinisch said.
   Less than 20 percent of poll participants got at least 12
questions right, and only five people out of the 1,974 polled
answered at least 16 questions correctly, Reinisch said.
   Participants from the Midwest generally scored best, with 55
percent passing, followed by 47 percent in the West and 40 percent
in the South and Northeast, she said.
   Overall there were no differences in accuracy by sex, but men
did better in questions about rates of sexual behavior and women in
questions about sexual health care and contraception, Reinisch said.
   The poll is described in a new book, ``The Kinsey Institute New
Report on Sex.'' At a news conference, Reinisch said the poll was
financed by book publisher St. Martin's Press and the Kinsey
Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction.
   In addition, The Roper Organization, which conducted the poll,
was ``very generous,'' she said.
   The poll involved face-to-face interviews with a nationally
representative sample of Americans, done last October as part of a
larger Roper survey. Twelve questions were answered on a
questionnaire that a person slipped into an envelope before
returning to the interviewer.
   The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. The
overall percentages exclude 263 participants who answered 10 or
fewer of the 18 items. The remaining participants were still a
representative sample, Reinisch said.

   There were yellow ribbons everywhere as
10-year-old Jennifer Anderton reported to her fifth grade class in
Larkspur Elementary School, fresh from one month as a hostage in
Kuwait.
   ``Let's start school,'' she said without hesitation Wednesday,
giggling with joy as 180 schoolmates and teachers greeted her at
the school in the foothills of Douglas County.
   Classmates crowded around her on the front sidewalk, around the
flagpole and beside the golden-iced cake, scripted in amber-colored
icing: ``Welcome Home, Jenny.''
   Then principal Cheryl Dunkle led the whole student body in the
pledge of allegiance to the American flag.
   Jerrifer's pals Delisha Donnelly and Justin Sinn wouldn't have
imagined such a reunion several months ago, when Jennifer left for
a two- to five- year stay in Kuwait with her parents, Bonnie and
Richard Anderton.
   The Iraqi invasion shattered those plans, trapping Jennifer and
her parents, Bonnie and Richard Anderton, in the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait City since early August.
   Jennifer and her mother were allowed to return to Colorado on
Monday. Her father, an engineer, is still in Kuwait.

   Investigators in the slayings of five
Gainesville students today searched the apartment of an 18-year-old
part-time student charged with beating his grandmother.
   Alachua Sheriff's Lt. Spencer Mann also said that 180 miles
away, in Indialantic, task force investigators also were searching
the home of Edward Lewis Humphrey's grandmother, as well as his
black Cadillac parked there.
   ``The searches were begun simultaneously'' at about 9:30 a.m.,
Mann said. Mann said search warrants were obtained late Wednesday,
and would remain sealed temporarily.
   Today was the first time investigators have acknowledged
obtaining search warrants in the case. They have said Humphrey is
one of eight suspects.
   The Gainesville Sun reported in today's editions that
investigators on Wednesday searched a Gainesville Best Western
motel room where Humphrey's mother had stayed in August.
Investigators released no details on that search.
   Humphrey's attorneys were in court this morning asking a Brevard
County judge to reduce Humphrey's $1 million bond. He was arrested
Aug. 30 on a charge of aggravated assault after he allegedly
battered his 79-year-old grandmother.
   An initial bond of $10,000 was increased after task force
investigators said he was a possible suspect in Gainesville.
   Investigators have refused to confirm a Miami Herald report
Wednesday that the five college students' bodies were posed for
maximum shock value.
   Police have previously said, without elaboration, that the
killer appeared to have left taunting ``messages'' for them in the
way he arranged evidence at the scene.
   Meanwhile, an expert who examined the off-campus apartments for
fingerprints with a high-tech light-intensifying device said the
killer was methodical and cautious and had left practically no
evidence behind.
   Four women and a man, all students at the University of Florida
or Santa Fe Community College, were slain last month in three
attacks that terrorized the town. Three victims were mutilated; one
of the three was decapitated, police said.
   The killer placed the severed head in the direct line of vision
of anyone entering the apartment and positioned a mirror in an
apartment to show another victim's body to anyone who happened to
look in the window, the Herald said.
   The killer also poured bleach onto the genitals of the four
women victims in an apparent attempt to confuse investigators about
whether they were sexually assaulted, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified sources.
   Police would not confirm the report and have refused to say
whether the victims were sexually assaulted.
   On Monday, however, police Capt. R.B. Ward said: ``In the scene,
the set-up, there was a message _ to law enforcement, to whoever.
... He was very calculated, very methodical in the way the person
did things, as well as left things.''
   After examining the apartments for fingerprints, Dr. Michael
West, a deputy medical examiner and forensic dentist from
Hattiesburg, Miss., said Wednesday, ``I've never been associated
with a crime scene that had so many violent attacks and so little
evidence left behind.''
   ``This individual that perpetrated these crimes is not your
average criminal,'' West said. ``He's very methodical, and very
neat. He doesn't leave any traces of his presence in the crime
scenes.''
   He said he turned up prints but that they probably belonged to
residents of the apartments. He said he was certain the killer left
no prints.
   Only Humphrey and Stephen Michael Bates, a 30-year-old Lakeland
short-order cook, have been mentioned publicly as suspects. Bates
has been held in the Polk County Jail on $100,500 bail since his
Aug. 29 arrest in an unrelated assault case.
   About 600 people attended a memorial service for the victims
Wednesday.
   Michael Browne, student body president, said, ``This hurt so
badly because the people taken from us were just like us.''
   The victims were Christa Hoyt, 19; Sonja Larson, 18; Christina
Powell, 17; Tracy Paules, 23; and Manuel Taboada, 23.

   A Japanese company is the new owner
of the Pebble Beach Co., which owns and operates luxury resorts and
golf courses on Monterey Bay.
   Ben Hogan Properties bought the 5,300-acre property 110 miles
south of San Francisco from a real estate partnership, company
officials announced Wednesday. Its Japanese parent company is Cosmo
World Corp.
   The purchase price was not disclosed, but local sources said it
was more than $1 billion.
   Pebble Beach Co.'s properties include the Pebble Beach Golf
Links, The Lodge at Pebble Beach and the Inn and Links at Spanish
Bay. The property also includes famed Spyglass Hill and Del Monte
golf courses, 17-Mile Drive and substantial real estate parcels on
the Monterey Peninsula.
   The sale also includes the famous lone cypress tree, a popular
tourist attraction on a windswept finger of rock along the 17-Mile
Drive near Carmel.
   The tree has been photographed by such famous photographers as
Ansel Adams and Edward Weston; recently, the Pebble Beach Co. was
embroiled in a dispute with professional photographers when the
company barred commercial use of photos of the tree, which is the
company's trademark.
   Company officials said they expect no changes in the management
of the resort area.
   Cosmo World Corp., headed by Minoru Isutani of Tokyo, is a
privately held company that has built more than 15 golf courses in
Japan as well as other projects in Europe and the United States.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today upheld a
judge's dismissal of charges against an Iran-Contra scandal
defendant because the government refused to allow the defense to
use classified materials.
   Joseph Fernandez, the CIA station chief in Costa Rica from
1984-86, was entitled to the material to defend himself against
charges that he lied to investigators about a scheme to send
military aid to Contra rebels in Nicaragua, said a three-judge
panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Fernandez planned to use the classified evidence to argue that
he did not lie about his knowledge of former National Security
Council official Oliver North's involvement in the scheme and the
type of supplies being sent to the Contras.
   ``Whether a jury would believe Fernandez's defense is
speculation. But to preclude the jury from considering evidence
relevant to this defense would be to deprive him of fundamental
constitutional protections,'' said the opinion by Judge J. Harvie
Wilkinson III. He was joined by Judges William W. Wilkins Jr. and
Robert F. Chapman.
   The 40-page opinion deletes numerous mentions of sensitive
national security information.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton of Alexandria dismissed the
case last November after the government refused to submit the
classified material sought by Fernandez.
   The former CIA station chief had been indicted on two counts of
lying to investigators and two counts of obstructing justice. He
was accused of telling investigators that a Costa Rican airstrip
was for training that country's military in case of an invasion by
Nicaragua when in fact the airstrip was used to illegally resupply
the Contras.
   He also was accused of falsely saying he did not know of North's
involvement and did not know that supplies he helped deliver to the
Contras in 1986 contained military aid.
   Fernandez asked to disclose nearly 5,000 classified documents at
his trial.

   Sexual straying sometimes hits in high ecclesiastical circles,
jarring officialdom and the rank and file.
   When an ordinary priest or minister gets involved in a sexual
tangle, a frequent occurrence according to studies, it's scarcely
noticed, and often not publicly at all.
   But reactions are intense when it happens to high magisterial
prelates, as shown by several recent cases. Careers are toppled and
questions swarm about why the respected churchmen let it happen.
   ``It's individually complicated, but it's related to the
collapse of the clerical culture, a collapsing of all hierarchical
structures,'' said Eugene Kennedy, a noted Roman Catholic
psychologist.
   ``Supports to a celibate life of authority, prestige and
privilege were given when the hierarchical structure functioned,
but these do not exist anymore. The rules become more difficult to
see and the role is blurred.''
   Under the circumstances, he added in a telephone interview,
``these kinds of failures wouldn't surprise me.''
   While deviation from the celibacy rule marked recent cases of
notable Roman Catholics and that of a Greek Orthodox bishop, it was
an extra-marital affair that tripped up an eminent Protestant
leader.
   The Rev. Allen Boesak, 44, a renowned anti-apartheid leader in
South Africa, resigned Aug. 10 as president of the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches after admitting a sexual liaison with a
television producer.
   ``A prophet is human and gets scared,'' the repeatedly jailed
and threatened Boesak once told American Presbyterians. ``A prophet
fails often. He can give in to temptation. And if that happens, who
will confront the world?''
   Other prominent cases include:
   _ Roman Catholic Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, 56, of Atlanta,
the first black archbishop in the American hierarchy, resigned July
10 after revelations of a two-year ``intimate relationship'' with a
young woman singer and lay minister.
   _ The Rev. Bruce Ritter, 63, founder of New York City's Covenant
House and a multimillion-dollar string of shelters for young
runaways, resigned last February after accusations of sexual
affairs by male youths. An investigative report released in August
found he had a consistent pattern of sexual misconduct.
   _ Greek Orthodox Bishop Anthimos, 57, resigned as head of the
church's Denver diocese in 1987 at the behest of Patriarch
Dimitrios I of Istanbul, Turkey, after the bishop was accused of
seducing a priest's daughter and keeping her in ``sexual
servitude.''
   In Greek Orthodoxy, priests are allowed to marry, but bishops
are vowed to celibacy, as are Roman Catholic priests and bishops.
   These four cases involved ecclesiastical heavyweights with
honored positions and powerful influence in their churches, a
different level than the promotional TV preachers snared in sex
scandals.
   Jim Bakker, 49, who left his PTL network in 1987 after
revelations of extra-marital sex with former church secretary
Jessica Hahn and hush money paid to her, was sentenced last fall to
45 years in prison for defrauding contributors.
   Jimmy Swaggart, on his TV show in 1988, tearfully confessed
``moral failure'' and a New Orleans prostitute recounted paid
sessions with him.
   Both Swaggart and Bakker were defrocked by the Assemblies of
God, Swaggart after refusing a year-long disciplinary suspension.
   The TV preachers, focused on their own individual followings of
mostly impersonal and remote audiences, contrast distinctly with
high-ranking church dignitaries, but none is immune to sex scandal.
   The U.S. Protestant and Eastern Orthodox establishment of the
National Council of Churches was rocked in 1983 when former United
Bishop James Armstrong resigned both as bishop and as council
president, saying he had failed his family and the gospel, later
indicating female involvement.
   A brilliant, leading member of the French Roman Catholic
hierarchy, Cardinal Jean Danielou, 69, died of a brain hemorrhage
in 1974 in the Paris apartment of a young go-go dancer and
prostitute.
   Police and church authorities tried to hush it up but abandoned
the attempt after a French weekly published details. Danielou was
carrying much cash and some theorized he hoped to buy her freedom
from racketeers using her for prostitution.
   Kennedy, a much-published professor at Loyola University in
Chicago, said that clergymen, as trusted counselors of distressed
people seeking solace, are susceptible to sexual involvement if
they aren't careful.
   ``This is common in all the helping professions,'' he said.
``Whenever someone has an emotional need, they quickly transfer
that need to the person helping. But counselors are trained to
understand what's happening.
   ``That's what it means to be professional, to accept someone's
problem without being entangled in it. If they are, then they are
no longer able to help.''

<HEAD>Suspected Collaborator Killed, Palestinian Shot by Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Masked Palestinian youths Thursday beat to
death a 70-year-old Arab man who was suspected of selling land to
Israelis in the occupied West Bank, Arab reports said.
   The victim, identified as Sami Khurshi of the village of Jaius,
allegedly sold lad that eventually was incorporated into a Jewish
settlement, villagers said.
   The slaying was claimed in slogans painted on walls and signed
by the Black Panthers enforcement squad, the villagers said.
   The army said it had no information about the killing.
   Khurshi's death raised to 256 the number of Palestinians killed
by fellow Arabs since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation began in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in December 1987.
Most were suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities or
dealing in drugs or prostitution.
   At least 728 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the revolt. Forty-seven Israelis have died.
   In Gaza City on Thursday, a Palestinian man was shot in the head
by Israeli troops who were pursuing masked stone-throwers, the army
said. The man, Tasir Rahman, 23, was reported in serious condition
at Saroka Hospital in Beersheva.
   Meanwhile, Palestinian shops and offices were shuttered in the
territories in a general strike called by the Moslem fundamentalist
movement Hamas, or Zeal.
   The strike was called to show solidarity with Iraqis and
Kuwaitis. In leaflets distributed in the territories, Hamas has
opposed the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait but has also expressed
opposition to U.S. troops in the region.
   A major Hamas leader who had been jailed for most of the past 30
months was freed this week, residents in the Gaza Strip said
Thursday. He is Dr. Abdel Aziz Rantisi, a physician who was a
founder of Hamas and is said to have written the first leaflet
distributed during the uprising.
   Rantisi, a resident of the Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, was
convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison for his role in
founding Hamas. Israeli authorities describe Hamas as a
paramilitary fundamentalist Moslem group.

<HEAD>Government Disperses Opposition Rally; Second Time in Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces used tear gas and
truncheons Thursday to disperse government opponents who tried to
hold a protest march in the city center.
   It was the second time in a week opposition parties have been
prevented from marching. President Felix Houphouet-Boigny legalized
opposition parties in May after unprecedented unrest in this West
African nation, but authorities have often refused the parties
permission to hold rallies.
   Soldiers carrying automatic rifles took up positions Wednesday
night in downtown Abidjan after the government warned it would
block demonstrations.
   Authorities alleged that the government opponents hope to
disrupt the visit of Pope John Paul II, who arrives Sunday to
consecrate the huge basilica that Houphouet-Boigny had built in his
hometown of Yamoussoukro.
   The scheduled reopening of high schools and universities, closed
in April after violent protests, was delayed until after the pope's
visit.
   Opposition parties have accused Houphouet-Boigny's government of
corruption and blame it for the collapse of the country's economy.
   Houphouet-Boigny has ruled Ivory Coast since it gained
independence from France in 1960.
   The government has been unable to pay its foreign debt for two
years, and many foreign firms have left the country. Tax rates are
among the highest in the world.

   The military government closed Khartoum
University on Thursday and ordered students off the campus after
repeated strikes against new regulations.
   Thousands of students have been protesting a new system that
requires payment for housing and food, which formerly were provided
without charge. The first strikes were staged last month and lasted
three days each.
   Opponents say the rules will make education affordable only to
the relatively well-to-do. Sudan is among the poorest countries in
the world.
   On Wednesday, striking students occupied lecture halls and
prevented non-strikers from entering.
   Police have not intervened, but the government apparently was
concerned that violence could erupt. In previous years, students in
conflict over various issues have attacked one another with sticks
and knives.
   Abdeen Mohamed Ali Saleh, the university's acting vice
president, announced the indefinite closure of the university,
which has 9,000 students. He said the move was taken to prevent
``escalation of a situation that may result in human and material
loss.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Gallery, Director Must Stand Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled today that an art gallery and
its director must stand trial later this month on obscenity charges
for displaying five sexually graphic photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe.
   Dennis Barrie and the Contemporary Arts Center already were
scheduled to go on trial Sept. 24 each on one misdemeanor charge of
using children in material involving nudity. The obscenity case
will be heard the same day.
   In his ruling today, Hamilton County Municipal Judge David
Albanese rejected a defense request to dismiss the obscenity
charge. Defense lawyers had contended that the pictures were a
legitimate art exhibition and immune from Ohio's obscenity law.
   ``That is contrary to the ... law,''' Albanese said. ``The
affirmative defenses and issues of credibility are for the trier of
the case to decide.''
   Albanese today also granted a prosecution request to limit the
obscenity case to the five photographs described in the indictment
against Barrie and the center.
   He rejected defense claims that the jury had to consider all of
the photos in the exhibition _ including shots of flowers and
sculpture _ because the show was a survey of Mapplethorpe's life.
   ``A photograph makes an immediate impression,'' Albanese said.
``The court finds that each photograph has a separate identity.''
   He said prosecutors only have to prove that one of the
photographs is obscene to win a conviction.
   Among photographs at issue in the case are separate shots of a
boy and a girl with their genitals exposed.
   The maximum penalty for each charge is a $1,000 fine and six
months in jail for Barrie and $5,000 fine for the Contemporary Arts
Center.
   The charges were filed April 7, the day the six-week exhibition
opened to the public. The exhibition closed May 26, after 81,000
people had visited the gallery.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibition opened Aug. 1 at the Institute for
Contemporary Art in Boston. A court clerk in that city on Wednesday
refused a request to file obscenity charges.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. agreed today with the
Bush administration that advances have been made in the war against
drugs, but said the situation still remains far worse than it was a
few years ago.
   ``It's been a year (since the administration announced its
national drug control strategy) and I think you've made some great
progress,'' Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
told national drug control policy director William J. Bennett.
   However, Biden said, ``We have a way to go to get even to the
'84 level, much less dealing with this problem.''
   ``We're not saying the war is over.... We're certainly not
saying it will be over soon,'' Bennett responded.
   President Bush had said Wednesday, ``I think America is making
progress against drugs and will continue to do so.''
   Bush and Bennett released a document showing declines in
emergency room admissions for cocaine and heroin, surveys showing
Americans' increasing hostility toward illegal drugs, and increases
in prices for cocaine and reductions in its purity, indicating a
reduction in supply.
   The statistics indicate the wholesale price of a kilo of cocaine
now ranges from $17,500 to $35,000, up from a range of $11,000 to
$25,000 last year.
   But Biden noted that the wholesale price in 1984 was $40,000 to
$50,000.
   In addition, he said, while the number of cocaine-related
emergency room cases declined slightly last year to 42,145 at
hospitals checked by the federal government, those emergency rooms
had only 10,248 cocaine-related cases in 1985.
   Bennett asked Biden if he could persuade his colleagues on
Capitol Hill to continue their pattern of giving the drug war even
more money than the administration requested. ``It'll be a hell of
a lot harder to do it this year than it was last year or the year
before,'' Biden said.
   On Wednesday, Bush told staff aides and reporters that after a
year there ``is still too much violence, too much destruction, too
many innocent victims.''
   He said drugs remain ``an international menace'' but declared
that his administration would ``remain on the front lines until
this scourge is licked for good.''
   The Judiciary Committee issued a report on Wednesday hailing as
a major success an increase in spending on Justice Department
efforts to combat drugs to more than $3.8 billion this year, $1.5
billion over the 1989 level.
   The report also pointed to increases in drug agents, cocaine
prices and criminal convictions.
   Among major failures, though, it listed cuts in the ranks of the
Border Patrol and other agencies as well as relaxed controls on
some military assault-style weapons tied to the drug trade.
   The mixed review ranged from praise for expanded treatment
facilities to concern that the administration may have undercounted
by as much as two thirds the number of hard-core cocaine addicts,
which it put at 2.4 million.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., told a news conference that Bush and
Bennett ``cannot deny that we are losing the drug war in our inner
cities.''
   ``Prevention and education efforts directed at the educated
middle-class appear to be having a dramatic effect,'' said Conyers,
who chairs the House Government Operations Committee. ``Treatment
programs have room for clients who can afford to pay.''
   ``However, the chronically addicted cannot pay when they are
poor and unemployed, as is often the case,'' the lawmaker from
Detroit added.
   New York City police Commissioner Lee Brown told the Judiciary
Committee that initial enthusiasm over the war on drugs was
dampened by a lack of federal aid to local police.
   He said New York was designated a ``high-intensity drug area''
under the program and thus made eligible for increased funding. But
he said none of the $4 million in additional aid went directly to
local police.
   Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates said the drug strategy
``may not be perfect, but I think it is a good one.'' He said the
price of cocaine is up while the quality may be deteriorating as a
result of the war against drugs.
   But both officials said heroin, overshadowed in recent years by
the cocaine plague, is now making a comeback on the streets of
their cities.
   Brown said heroin seizures skyrocketed 80 percent in New York
last year and are up 20 percent this year. Gates said the figures
were similar in Los Angeles and described the phenomenon as an
unintended consequence of the war against cocaine.

Activists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former union president whose gun was used to
kill two anti-Marcos activists in 1981 has been arrested in the
slayings, police said today.
   Constantine ``Tony'' Baruso was president of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union when Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo were gunned down
in the union offices in Seattle on June 1, 1981.
   Baruso was arrested at his home in Tacoma late Wednesday on a
warrant charging him with two counts of aggravated first-degree
murder, Seattle Police spokesman Mark Amundson said.
   Dan Donahoe, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said he
would not give details of the charges but said a news conference
would be held later in the day.
   Baruso was being held in the King County Jail on $500,000 bail.
   Baruso's attorney, Anthony Savage, said that he was surprised at
the arrest but that the criminal charges would give Baruso an
opportunity to clear his name.
   Baruso, who told authorities the gun used in the case had been
stolen from him, was never previously charged criminally in the
case, but was found liable for millions of dollars in damages in a
federal lawsuit brought by the victims' families.
   Three men, members of a Filipino gang called Tulisan, were found
guilty of murder at the original criminal trial. Prosecutors in
that case argued the killings stemmed from an internal union
dispute in which Domingo and Viernes were working to end
gang-dominated gambling in Alaska fish canneries.
   In the civil lawsuit, however, family members contended the
slayings were ordered from Manila because of Domingo's and Viernes'
activism against the martial-law regime of then-Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   A U.S. District Court jury last December awarded the families
$15.1 million from Marcos' estate and from his widow, Imelda. U.S.
District Judge Barbara Rothstein later found Baruso and Marcos
friend Dr. Leonilo Malabed of San Francisco liable for an
additional $8.4 million.
   Baruso, a prominent member of the Seattle Philippine-American
community, testified in both the criminal and civil trials, but
repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   Evidence in the civil trial indicated Baruso flew to San
Francisco two weeks before the murders and picked up $15,000 from
Malabed, who was accused of maintaining a Philippines intelligence
``slush fund.''
   The plaintiffs alleged Baruso kept $10,000 for himself and gave
$5,000 to the triggermen.
   Authorities identified Baruso's gun as the murder weapon, but
said Baruso told them the weapon had been stolen from him.
   Baruso was later convicted of embezzling money from the union.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today U.S.-Soviet
cooperation in the Persian Gulf crisis is an example of the
benefits of the warming relationship between the two nations, a
partnership he hopes to strengthen in a weekend meeting with
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Bush said the United States remains resolute in its goals in the
gulf region, where U.S. troops have been dispatched to defend Saudi
Arabia from threatened aggression by Iraq's Saddam Hussein after
his invasion of Kuwait.
   Bush also said he saw ``a real opportunity'' in an Iraqi
proposal for him to speak on their state-run television.
   ``The president has a very distinct message that he wants to
give to the people of Iraq,'' White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said as the president flew here to address a rally for
Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden's re-election drive.
   Before departing the White House, Bush took a flurry of calls
from world leaders about the gulf crisis and his upcoming summit
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. He placed a call himself
to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, an ally with the West in the
stand against Saddam Hussein's seizure of Kuwait.
   Bush complained last week that he was not getting equal time to
get his message across to the people of Iraq. Saddam Hussein has
been interviewed by CBS-TV anchorman Dan Rather and his speeches,
delivered through a spokesman in Baghdad, have been aired at length
on CNN and other American networks.
   ``Iraq's information minister has offered to broadcast a message
from President Bush to the people of Iraq on their state-run
television,'' Fitzwater said. ``We have not heard from Iraq
directly we accept their offer of a broadcast to the Iraqi people.
The president will tape a message to the Iraqi people in the next
few days will be provided to the Iraqi information minister.''
   Naji al-Hadithi, director general of Iraq' information ministry,
said earlier today in Baghdad he was making the offer on Saddam's
instructions. He said an Iraqi television crew was ready to go to
Washington to interview Bush.
   That won't be necessary, the White House said.
   ``We'll produce it ourselves,'' said Fitzwater, who said the
White House envisions a 10 to 15 minute broadcast that will also be
made available to the rest of the world. He said Bush is not
worried about the possibility of censorship.
   ``We assume that their offer means they will broadcast it in its
entirety,'' his spokesman said.
   ``The president has a very distinct message that he wants to
give the people of Iraq (about) our purpose for being in the gulf.
He thinks this is a good opportunity,'' Fitzwater said. ``We take
them at their word.''
   In his remarks in Topeka, Bush said the past year has seen ``new
levels of cooperation between our two nations.''
   ``The Persian Gulf shows what this cooperation can achieve. ...
This meeting can further expand cooperation between the U.S. and
Soviet Union,'' Bush said.
   Bush also said the United States is resolute in the goals of its
military presence in the gulf region.
   ``We will not stand by while one country devours another
unthreatening country whole,'' he said of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. ``Our cause may not be easy but it will always be right.''
   On a separate matter, the White House said there is no new U.S.
economic aid package for the Soviet Union in the offing.
   Bush heads to Helsinki, Finland, Friday night and will meet with
Gorbachev there on Sunday. ``We will be talking to the Soviets
about technical assistance,'' said Fitzwater, but ``there's no new
economic aid package.''
   Bush called U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
Wednesday night to thank for his efforts to solve the gulf crisis.
   Perez de Cuellar went to Jordan last week for talks with Iraq's
foreign minister that failed to produce a breakthrough.
   Bush received phone calls this morning from Turkish President
Turget Ozal, French President Francois de Mitterrand and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss the Gorbachev summit and
the gulf situation.
   Bush also called Syria's Assad to discuss the gulf crisis.
   Today was Bush's first trip on a Boeing 747 commissioned as the
new Air Force One. ``It's so much roomier. My heavens,'' Bush said.
   He gave reporters a rare peek at his personal office and
quarters in the nose of the plane. ``It's great. I'm sitting here
with the briefing book for the Helsinki summit,'' Bush said as he
sat with a seatbelt on at his large wooden desk.
   The plane has a range of 7,140 miles and an airborne refueling
capacity.
   After his appearance at the Hayden fund-raiser, Bush was off to
Florida to attend a rally in Tallahassee for Rep. Bill Grant of
Florida.
   Hayden, seeking his second four-year term, faces a surprise
Democratic challenger in state Treasurer Joan Finney, who defeated
former Gov. John Carlin for the Democratic nomination.
   In Tallahassee, Bush will attend a rally for Grant, who faces
Democrat Douglas ``Pete'' Peterson. Grant had no Republican primary
opponent. He is a former Democrat who switched parties last year,
and is seeking re-election in a heavily Democratic congressional
district.

<HEAD>Businesses Trimming Plans for New Plants, Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses plan to increase spending
for new plants and equipment just 5.1 percent over 1989, the
smallest growth in three years, the government said Thursday.
   Analysts said the Commerce Department survey shows that
businesses remain leery of a softening economy and worried about
falling profits.
   The department said the survey found businesses planning to
spend $526.9 billion for expansion and modernization this year, the
fourth consecutive year of increased business investment.
   But while the projected investment would top last year's record
$501.6 billion, the 5.1 percent increase would be less than half of
the 10.4 percent spending gain in 1989 and the lowest since a 3.1
percent advance in 1987.
   Capital spending rose 9.5 percent in 1988.
   The new estimate also is down from the 5.5 percent spending
increase that businesses said they planned in the previous survey
completed in May.
   ``It confirms the economy is sluggish and expectations for the
future are that it will continue to be sluggish,'' said economist
Thomas Runiewicz of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   After-tax corporate profits, which rose just 1.5 percent from
January through March, fell 0.2 percent in the second quarter and
many analysts expect them to fall farther in the last half of the
year.
   Businesses often are reluctant to make capital investments as
their profit margins weaken.
   Runiewicz said the bulk of the survey was completed before the
Persian Gulf crisis and added that higher prices and uncertainty
after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait could cut investment
spending even further. The survey was begun in July and completed
in mid-August.
   However, economists at Mitsubishi Bank in New York suggested in
their current newsletter the crisis would have little effect on
1990 investments, ``given that most of this spending is already set
in motion.''
   Runiewicz said business investment contributed to the growth in
the nation's economy in 1988 and 1989 and said the slower increase
in capital spending this year would further reduce growth.
   Many analysts have been looking for continued business
investment to help keep alive an economy that has been weakening
for more than a year as the Federal Reserve kept a tight rein on
credit to curb inflation.
   Some economists said even before the oil-price shock associated
with the Persian Gulf crisis that the economy is headed for a
slight recession later this year.
   Spending on replacements for aging plants and equipment and
expanded facilities also helps boost U.S. productivity, an
increasingly important factor in view of the stiff competition the
nation faces from overseas.
   Before adjusting for inflation, the department projected a 5.4
percent increase for all businesses this year to $534.8 billion
after gains of 11.4 percent last year and 11 percent in 1988.
   It said the investment increase for all industries includes a
4.7 percent gain for manufacturing companies and a 5.8 percent
advance for companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing businesses.
   Manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of
$192.4 billion.
   The gain includes a 2.6 percent increase by industries making
durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last at least three
years _ and a 6.4 percent increase by those engaged in non-durables
such as food and clothing.

   The area code for the Pentagon will change
from 202 to 703 effective Oct. 1, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The change is in line with new telephone dialing procedures
being implemented by C&amp;P Telephone in the Washington, D.C., area.
   As of Oct. 1, Pentagon callers will be required to dial 10
digits when making a local call outside their particular area code.
   For example, a caller in the Pentagon, which is in Virginia,
will have to dial the area code and the seven digit local number to
reach a number in the District of Columbia.
   Long distance dialing will remain unchanged.
   In addition, all telephone numbers with the 694 prefix in the
Pentagon will be changed to 614 as of Oct. 1, the announcement said.
   The 694 prefix is used in Stuart, Va., in the 703 area code
region.

   Comedian Jay Leno will perform two shows for
U.S. troops stationed in the Persian Gulf during the Thanksgiving
holiday, the United Service Organization announced Thursday.
   Leno's appearances will be the first USO shows in the area since
Iraq invaded Kuwait, but others will follow.
   ``We're all seeing that the enemy the troops are fighting right
now is boredom and loneliness,'' said Kevin McCarthy, executive
producer for the USO. ``Jay Leno will fix that. If the troops are
still there at Thanksgiving, this will be a welcome break.''
   Troops will be admitted to the Leno shows without charge, and
Leno is performing for free, the USO said.

   The Novi Police Department has a claim to
fame it can't get rid of.
   Locked in a file cabinet, along with stolen license plates and a
few bad checks, is a light blue scarf worn by Madonna during the
filming of her video ``True Blue.''
   ``If it wasn't for the notoriety of this scarf, it would be in
the Dumpster,'' said Detective Max Roder.
   He and Detective Ralph Fluhart recovered the scarf after it and
a Madonna dress were stolen from an MTV-sponsored display at the
Twelve Oaks mall in 1988. Each has written to the music video
network asking it to claim the swath.
   Their letters have gone unanswered.
   ``This is the first I'm hearing about any of this,'' David Cohn,
director of national promotion for MTV, said Wednesday in Los
Angeles.
   He said he would look into the matter after tonight's MTV video
music awards program.
   A 20-year-old Dearborn woman pleaded guilty in 1989 to stealing
the dress. She was placed on two years' probation and ordered to
receive psychological counseling.
   Fluhart said the department would like to auction it this fall,
with proceeds going to its drug awareness program.

   Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is
planning to visit China, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
   Embassy spokesman Edward Loo said Kissinger was scheduled to
arrive Friday, but added the embassy was not involved with the
visit and could provide no other information.
   The Foreign Ministry, Kissinger's host, said no information was
available.
   China considers Kissinger an ``old friend'' since he made a
secret visit in 1971 that set the stage for the resumption of
relations between China and the United States after a 23-year rift.
   Since then, Kissinger has visited China at least 15 times, most
recently last November.
   He was among the first prominent Americans to come to China in
the months following the June 1989 military attack on pro-democracy
protesters that left hundreds, perhaps thousands dead.
   Kissinger has defended the Chinese leadership's handling of the
pro-democracy movement, claiming that no other government in the
world would have tolerated the occupation of Tiananmen Square by
protesters as China did.

   Everybody else wore Buddy Holly glasses; Paul
McCartney stuck to John Lennon-style wire rims. Other than that,
McCartney was entirely in the spirit of things at his annual
birthday tribute to Holly, one of the founding fathers of rock 'n'
roll.
   ``I think from an early age all of us were wildly influenced by
the man,'' McCartney said at Tuesday's bash at the Lone Star
Roadhouse. Then he launched into a rocking rendition of Holly's
``Oh, Boy!''
   Holly, who was killed in a plane crash in 1959, would have
turned 54 Friday. This was the 15th annual tribute to him by Paul
and Linda McCartney, and the first not held in London.
   McCartney owns the copyrights to Holly's songs, which are about
to hit Broadway in the form of ``Buddy: The Buddy Holly Story,''
the London musical.
   There were plenty of Holly songs Tuesday night.
   The cast of the musical cranked out a few of the master's hits.
Then, it turned things over to the celebrities, including
McCartney, E-Street Band members Garry Tallent and Max Weinberg,
Pat Denizio of the Smithereens, Ricky Van Shelton, Steve Forbert,
Joe Ely and two of Holly's original Crickets _ drummer Jerry
Allison and bassist Joe B. Mauldin.
   Among the songs: ``Well . . . Alright,'' ``Rock Around with
Ollie Vee,'' ``True Love Ways,'' ``Wild Child,'' ``Heartbeat,''
``Love's Made a Fool of You'' and, most appropriate of all, ``Not
Fade Away.''

   Talk about fearless. Don Rickles says he once
mercilessly insulted mob boss Joey Gallo and lived to tell about
it. Gallo, as it turned out, didn't.
   Rickles, who's appearing with Frank Sinatra and Pia Zadora this
week, recalled the incident in an interview. He said he was
performing at the Copacabana nightclub in New York in 1972 when
Gallo came to see the show. Bodyguards appeared backstage before
the show to tell Rickles their boss didn't want to be teased.
   ``That's like painting a bull's eye on yourself,'' Rickles said.
``A guy sits in the front row smoking a big cigar and surrounded by
five bodyguards and I'm supposed to ignore him?''
   Rickles said he hit on Gallo repeatedly and Gallo couldn't stop
laughing. Afterward, Gallo invited Rickles to his 43rd birthday
celebration at Umberto's Clam House.
   Rickles declined. A few hours later, four men walked into
Umberto's and gunned down Gallo.
   ``Frankly, I didn't go because I was a little nervous. And
besides, I didn't like clams,'' Rickles said.

   The Internal Revenue Service has
canceled the public sale of comedian Pat Paulsen's troubled winery
operation and property in northern Sonoma County.
   The forced sale of Paulsen's home, winery, and the village of
Asti, which he owns, had been set for Sept. 13. The IRS seized the
property and put it up for sale to recover $277,000 in unpaid taxes
owed by Paulsen and his first wife, Jane Paulsen.
   But on Wednesday IRS officials said the sale won't proceed
because of legal challenges by the Paulsens' bankruptcy attorney,
David Replogle.
   Replogle said the Paulsens' property is protected from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Act. The Paulsens' total
debt is $2 million.
   ``The IRS is not above the law _ they have to follow the same
rules as everyone else,'' Replogle said.

   Talks between the African
National Congress and government officials on a no-violence pact
Thursday failed to quell unrest in black townships.
   Police in the Soweto township fired tear gas and shotguns to
disperse rival black factions in street clashes. Police said at
least one person was stabbed to death and 16 were injured, but
Soweto residents said three people died.
   Police also fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that burned a
shop in the Sebokeng township south of Johannesburg, the
government-run South African Broadcasting Co. reported.
   ANC and government delegations met for 2{ hours in Pretoria for
talks that were expected to focus on the status of ANC guerrillas
and the township fighting, which has claimed more than 550 lives
since Aug. 12. No statements were issued after meeting.
   A radio station reported the groups would meet again Tuesday.
   The ANC formally suspended its 29-year guerrilla campaign Aug.
6. The cease-fire has improved prospects for negotiations on a new
constitution to give blacks a voice in national affairs.
   But ANC leader Nelson Mandela and other groups have pressed for
an independent probe into army involvement in the deaths of 11
people this week in Sebokeng.
   Black leaders, including the South African Council of Churches
and an Anglican group led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have accused
soldiers of opening fire unneccesarily.
   Black townships around Johannesburg have been wracked by more
than three weeks of fighting between Zulu backers of the
conservative Inkatha movement and Xhosas and other blacks loyal to
the ANC.
   Some black leaders have accused police of fueling the violence
by siding with Inkatha. Police and the government deny the
accusation.
   The Star newspaper reported Thursday that masked white men
joined a group of blacks in attacking a Sebokeng migrant workers'
hostel before dawn Tuesday. It said the attack killed 19 people and
caused a crowd of township residents to gather at the hostel.
Soldiers later opened fire.
   In March, police fired on protesters in Sebokeng, killing five
and wounding 150. A special judicial review panel concluded the
gunfire was unjustified.
   President F.W. de Klerk said Thursday the continuing unrest
could hinder negotiations on black-white power sharing but that
talks would continue.
   ``There can be no real reform before stability,'' the president
said.
   The white-led government and the ANC, the main black opposition
group, have been holding periodic talks since May.
   In Pretoria on Thursday, Law and Order Minister Minister Adriaan
Vlok led the government delegation. The ANC group was headed by
Jacob Zuma, a member of its policy-making National Executive
Committee. Only three of the seven ANC members appointed to meet
with the government showed up.
   The man named to lead the ANC group, Chris Hani, was not present.
   He has been in the nominally independent Transkei homeland since
the government dropped him from a list of ANC leaders granted
temporary amnesty to participate in peace talks. Hani, leader of
the ANC's armed wing, has said the ANC would seize power if talks
with the government break down.
   De Klerk says he wants to end the apartheid system of racial
segregation and negotiate a constitution with opposition groups.
But he opposes black majority rule and a one-man, one-vote system.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, meanwhile, the fourth International
Conference Against Apartheid in Sport ended Thursday with delegates
urging a tightening of boycotts against South African athletes.
   Despite recent political changes in South Africa, the conference
said relaxing the boycotts ``would seriously prejudice'' progress
toward ending apartheid.
   Sports officials from South Africa and black African nations are
scheduled to hold formal talks for the first time in Harare,
Zimbabwe, Nov. 3-4. Officials from the International Olympic
Committee will attend.

   A high school sophomore held a half-dozen or
more schoolmates at gunpoint for several hours today, demanding
such things as soft drinks, candy and a school bus before finally
surrendering to police, authorities said.
   Forsyth County Sheriff Wesley Walraven said the youth
surrendered shortly before 2 p.m., about 5{ hours after the
incident began, and was being taken to the county jail. There were
no injuries.
   The boy and the hostages attended the combined South Forsyth
middle school-high school, said Joyce Shadburn, a spokeswoman for
the county's school superintendent.
   Sgt. J. Frix of the sheriff's department said the boy held 40-50
hostages at first, but most were released during the morning. He
estimated that fewer than 10 remained hostage by the time the boy
surrendered.
   The boy's name was not released.
   Stan Harrison, the school's football coach, said the boy was
armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun. Two other coaches
struggled with the boy when he first produced the weapons, and one
gun went off during the struggle, he said.
   ``He's a good kid and a smart kid,'' Harrison said. ``I think he
has a little trouble at home.''
   Ms. Shadburn said some of the hostages were freed in exchange
for candy and soda. The only other demand was for a school bus, she
said, adding that a bus had been taken to the scene.
   One of the freed girls, Shelly Dixon, said the boy told ``us to
stand up and put our hands on our heads. He started cussing at us.
He said if we said anything, he'd shoot us.''
   Capt. Jerry Padgett of the Forsyth County Sheriff's Department
said the situation generally stayed calm as authorities negotiated
with the student.
   The sheriff's department was called in by the school around 8:30
a.m.
   Other students were evacuated from the school, and streets in
the area were blocked, authorities said. ``They have the area
barricaded off. It's not in a residential area.''
   The school is located about five miles south of Cumming, a town
of 2,100 north of Atlanta.
   Buses were arranged to take the evacuated students home, Ms.
Shadburn said.

<TEXT>
   Federal health officials Thursday mapped a
national strategy to improve the health of all Americans by the end
of the century, putting the spotlight on preventing rather than
curing illness.
   The blueprint outlines 298 health objectives _ everything from
cutting the rate of infant deaths to increasing use of seat belts
to reducing the number of smokers.
   ``We can no longer ignore the fact that, individually and as a
nation, prevention is the single most important factor in
maintaining good health,'' said Dr. Louis Sullivan, health and
human services secretary.
   He called for ``a national priority for personal responsibility
and for choices that maintain or improve the health status of our
citizens.
   ``Such a climate would enhance the independence of our citizens
by preventing illness or disability, and this would, in turn, free
up resources for those who do encounter disease or disability,'' he
said.
   He noted that the United States spent $600 billion on health
care in 1989, and he said that if the same course is followed, the
bill would be $1.5 trillion by the turn of the century.
   The 671-page report identifies specific health objectives
covering a range of areas, including fitness, nutrition, tobacco,
alcohol, drugs, family planning, mental health, occupational and
environmental health, food safety, cancer, heart disease, AIDS,
infant health and sexually transmitted diseases.
   Sullivan said he was especially concerned about the disparity in
health status among Americans, particularly for the low-income
minority population.
   ``In almost every category of mortality listed, minority deaths
are greater than that of the white population,'' he said. For
example, black infants die at twice the rate of white infants.
   Although he stressed the importance of personal behavior,
Sullivan said the nation must find ways to make health care more
accessible to ``the most vulnerable among us.'' He made no new
proposals.
   Among the goals for 2000 are:
   _To increase to 30 percent the proportion of people who engage
in regular, moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes a
day, up from an estimated 22 percent in 1985.
   _To cut from 26 percent to 20 percent the proportion of
overweight adults.
   _To reduce from 29 percent to 15 percent the proportion of adult
smokers.
   _To reduce pregnancies to 50 per 1,000 girls under 18, from 71
per 1,000 in 1985.
   _To increase use of safety restraints to 85 percent of
automobile occupants from the current 42 percent.
   _To cut infant mortality to 7 deaths per 1,000 births.
Provisional data for 1989 show a rate of 9.7 per 1,000.
   _To reduce coronary heart disease deaths to 100 per 100,000,
from 135 per 100,000 who died from this disease in 1987.
   The objectives in ``Healthy People 2000'' were developed in a
three-year effort led by the Public Health Service and involved
more than 300 voluntary and professional organizations and state
health departments.
   The blueprint builds on a similar set of goals that were set
more than a decade ago to be achieved by this year. In assessing
progress made by the mid-1980s, health officials said nearly half
of the 226 objectives had already been or would likely be reached
on time. A final evaluation won't be made until 1992 after all the
data for the decade is compiled, officials said.
   However, it is already apparent that a high proportion of the 25
percent of 1990 objectives that won't be met involve poor health of
minority populations, said Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary of
health.
   ``We really as a nation are going to have to target those
(medical and preventive services) to those people'' who have not
had access to good health care, Mason said.

   On the street, his name is Rocstar. He runs with
his posse, FTS, a loosely knit crew known for graffiti and a love
of loud dance music. To police, he is simply Yull Gary Morales, 19,
of Queens, accused murderer.
   Morales and seven other young men were arrested Monday and
charged with the Sunday night stabbing of a Utah tourist on a
subway platform. The suspects allegedly wanted cash for a night of
drinks and dancing in Manhattan; instead, they wound up charged
with murder.
   Residents of the well-maintained, middle-class Queens
neighborhood where several members of the gang lived described the
suspects as guys who hung out at the schoolyard, drinking beer,
smoking dope and spray painting their names on the wall.
   On Thursday, one member was spray-painting something else: a
memorial to stabbing victim Brian Watkins. Watkins, 22, of Provo,
tried to intervene as the gang robbed his father and punched his
mother in the face.
   The gang often meets in the Flushing section; coincidentally,
Watkins had traveled to the same area to watch the U.S. Open tennis
tournament.
   On the night that Watkins was slain, several members of the gang
met in the two-story, stucco home of 18-year-old Ricardo Lopez. The
entire group hooked up at a subway station to head into Manhattan
and the Roseland Ballroom, with a brief stop for a mugging to
finance the evening.
   ``They used to come here,'' said Lopez's mom, Louisa Rodriguez.
``I used to throw them out because I knew they were up to no
good.'' It was not clear if she was home at that night's meeting.
   Morales was one of the founders of FTS, which some locals said
was an obscene acronym. Others says it stands for ``Flushing Top
Society''; either way, it's one of about a half-dozen gangs in the
area.
   Initiation into the gangs involves different rituals. Some FTS
members said it requires its members to mug somebody _ ``getting
paid,'' they call it _ before they join. Other gangs require
aspiring members to run a gantlet of gang members who beat and kick
him; a variation is putting the youth inside a circle and letting
him fight his way out.
   FTS has been around for about three years. At its peak in 1988,
it had about 250 members. Morales had been its leader, although he
lost face two years ago for backing down in a gang fight,
associates said. Police say he didn't back down when Watkins
defended his mother from the attackers. Instead, Morales fatally
stabbed the tourist, police said.
   Morales was not the only one armed that night, police said.
Emiliano Fernandez, 18, allegedly used a box cutter to slice the
pants pocket of Watkins' father and steal his wallet, which
contained $200.
   Fernandez, whose street moniker is ``Trauma,'' was the only
convicted criminal in the group, authorities said.
   Several of the others had pending charges: Lopez had an upcoming
trial for auto theft. Pascual Carpenter, 18, was arrested Aug. 27
for carrying a gun on the subway. Ricardo Nova, 18, was twice
arrested for fare beating; Luis Fernando Montero was busted once
for the same thing. Anthony Anderson, 18, was arrested after a
schoolyard fistfight last year.
   Only Johnny Hincapie, 18, had no arrest record. All eight are
now charged with murder, two counts of robbery and assault in
Watkins' slaying.
   On Thursday, FTS member Papo Love and about two dozens other
people were back in the schoolyard at JHS 189. Love, 19, had spent
the whole night creating a spray-painted memorial to Watkins.
   Watkins' first name was in bright red, orange and purple, with
his last name a blue outline with a grey interior. Written
alongside the name was ``Rest in peace'' and a peace symbol.
   ``I gave that tribute to him,'' said Love. ``I feel sorry for
him because he lost his life for defending his mom.''

   The U.S. military has built a sophisticated
network of medical facilities in the Saudi desert, including 15
hospitals that officials say are equipped to treat virtually any
type of combat wound.
   The hospitals include two medical ships being deployed in the
Persian Gulf, along with 13 facilities spread out across the
eastern province of the desert kingdom. Hundreds of doctors and
nurses, who can perform anything from neurosurgery to heart surgery
to orthopedic surgery, have been flown in to care for the estimated
60,000 U.S. troops so far deployed in Operation Desert Shield.
   Washington says the American troops are here to defend Saudi
Arabia in case of an attack by Iraq. The scope of the medical
system clearly shows that officials want to be prepared should war
break out.
   ``Our hospitals are just as capable, if not more capable, of
doing anything we do in the states,'' Col. Jerome Faust, commander
of the 44th Medical Brigade, said Thursday. His brigade runs the
Army's hospitals in Saudi Arabia.
   The U.S. Navy is building a 500-bed hospital in the desert.
Defense Department guidelines prohibit describing specific
locations and places.
   The state-of-the-art facility is housed in 24 air-conditioned
caramel tents, which include intensive care units, an operating
ward, and a laboratory and X-ray unit.
   ``We have it all. We're a little city,'' said Capt. Richard
Mayo, the hospital's commander. ``This is larger than any ground
facility we had in Vietnam.''
   When fully staffed, the hospital will have a staff of 900, 800
of them medical personnel.
   At another location, the Army is building a ``bubble'' hospital,
a 200-bed facility with a pharmacy attached. It is housed in a
series of caterpiller-shaped inflatable rubber structures that
resemble giant inner tubes. A tubine engine heats and cools the
interior.
   About 1.5 million tons of equipment, from narcotics to hospital
beds, were shipped from the United States for this hospital.
   Soldiers have worked mostly at night to set up the facility
because of the searing daytime temperatures. Twenty doctors will
eventually be assigned to it.
   Like the others, the hospital will be almost exclusively for
Americans. Saudis may be treated occasionally at U.S. facilities,
but the kingdom has its own modern system of medical care.
   Besides the hospitals, each military unit, such as a Marine
brigade in the desert, has doctors and paramedics assigned to it.
In combat, their role is to keep wounded soldiers alive until they
can be taken to a hospital.

   Humorist Minnie Pearl poked fun at her
health Thursday in urging federal government employees to support
the United Way.
   Miss Pearl, honorary co-chairwoman for an eight-county United
Way fund drive, said she wears a pacemaker but joked that ``the
doctor must have put it in wrong. Every time my husband kisses me,
the garage door goes up.''
   She also managed to joke about her 1985 breast cancer surgery.
   ``They gave me the breast of an 18-year-old, so I'm 18 years old
from the waist up,'' the 77-year-old Grand Ole Opry star told more
than 80 people at the breakfast meeting.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Criticize Reduced Overnight Deliveries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Postal Service decision to slow delivery of
some first-class mail in the face of a new rate increase ``is going
over like a lead balloon,'' Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank was
told Thursday.
   Telling Americans that longer delivery times for some mail
results in improved service is ``doublespeak _ it doesn't compute,
it doesn't jibe,'' Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., said at a hearing
by the House Government Operations subcommittee on government
information.
   Frank said the payoff will be more consistent delivery time.
``We asked the American people (in surveys) what good service is
and they said it is getting it there every time so they can count
on it,'' Frank said. The Postal Service concluded that mail users
want speed but want consistency more.
   Delaying some overnight deliveries will affect less than 5
percent of first-class mail, he said. ``The result will be a
win-win situation _ improved mail service for our customers and
improved efficiency for the Postal Service.''
   Frank said the change in overnight deliveries was not begun as a
cost-saving measure and has nothing to do with the pending 5-cent
increase in the price of a first-class stamp.
   Critics said many mail users feel they will be getting less
service but paying more for it. ``It's going over like a lead
balloon,'' said Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y.
   On July 28, the Postal Service reduced the number of non-local
overnight deliveries; starting later this month, about 5 percent of
letters that now require two days for delivery will require three.
   Even with the changes, Frank said, ``We are committed to deliver
more than half of all the first-class mail in this vast country
overnight.''
   The changes are taking effect over objections of the consumer
advocate for the Postal Rate Commission. Stephen A. Gold, director
of that office, told the subcommittee the Postal Service should
have done a cost-benefit analysis and tried to determine how much
speed mail users were willing to forgo in the interest of
consistent delivery times.
   Cary H. Baer, vice president of the Readers Digest Association
Inc., which spends $100 million a year for U.S. postage,
tentatively endorsed the changes because of their potential ``to
significantly improve consistency of delivery while having only
modest impact on speed.''

   When the city finished rebuilding a main
thoroughfare last week, the final brick was engraved with Mayor
Sophie Masloff's name and placed in the downtown street.
   But who is Fred Fischer and why did he have his own engraved
brick on Grant Street near the mayor's?
   That question stumped city officials, including Mrs. Masloff.
   ``I never heard of him,'' the mayor said Wednesday.
   ``Fred Flintstone?'' asked Albert J. Neri, the mayor's press
secretary. ``Yeah, I think he was around when we started the
project.''
   The mystery was solved by Deborah Liotus, the city's assistant
director of engineering and administration. She said Fred is a
project engineer for the city.
   ``The contractor had made up several bricks at his own cost for
people who worked on the project,'' she said. ``Fred didn't want
his. So they put it in the street.''
   Ms. Liotus said the brick, which was removed Wednesday
afternoon, was supposed to be placed with the engraved side down.

   Fife Symington leads Evan Mecham by 11
percentage points in the race for the Republican gubernatorial
nomination in Arizona, a statewide poll says.
   Twenty-nine percent of the Republicans who were questioned said
they favored Symington and 18 percent favored Mecham, according to
the poll conducted by Political-Media Research Inc. of Washington.
   Amongthe other candidates, Sam Steiger led with 16 percent,
followed by Fred Koory with 12 percent and Bob Barnes with 2
percent. The poll was sponsored by Tribune Newspapers and KPNX-TV
in Phoenix.
   Some 819 people were questioned between Saturday and Tuesday for
the poll, which has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
   Former Phoenix mayor Terry Goddard was shown to be well ahead of
Dave Moss, his opponent in next week's Democratic primary. Goddard
got the nod from 59 percent to Moss' 13 percent.
   The poll also showed that Goddard would defeat Symington and
Mecham if the general election were held today.

<HEAD>Nuke Plant Shutdown Ballot Measure Key Issue In Governor's Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ballot proposal to shut Oregon's only
nuclear power plant appears to have strong support among voters and
is a key issue in the governor's race.
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Barbara Roberts surprised
observers in July when she endorsed a shutdown of the Trojan plant
near Rainier, but she is heartened by the results of two polls
taken last month.
   The Nov. 6 ballot measure to force closing the plant is
supported by 73 percent of 600 registered voters surveyed in a poll
for The Oregonian newspaper. The measure was supported by 63
percent of those surveyed in a poll for Portland station KPTV.
   Republican gubernatorial candidate Dave Frohnmayer says closing
the plant is a bad idea that could leave the state vulnerable to
future energy shortages. Political tensions in the Persian Gulf
make this the wrong time to consider shutting Trojan, says
Frohnmayer, the state attorney general.
   Roberts has cited concerns about storage of radioactive waste.
   ``Dave has painted me as an extremist because of my position on
the nuclear safety issue,'' Roberts said.
   The results of polling on the issue ``may represent that Dave
Frohnmayer is out of touch with Oregonians,'' Roberts said
Wednesday.
   Frohnmayer noted that a similar measure on the 1986 ballot was
favored in early polling but eventually was defeated.

<HEAD>Celebrezze Apologizes For Staff `Reporter'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The campaign of Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. apologized Thursday for a staff
member who posed as a reporter at a news conference held by
Republican opponent George Voinovich.
   The Celebrezze campaign released a statement saying it had
learned that a staff member posed as a reporter for the Ohio State
University Lantern during a briefing Wednesday in which reporters
questioned Voinovich by telephone.
   ``This action was not authorized by the ... campaign, nor does
it comport to the philosophy or character of our candidates,''
Melinda Swan, Celebrezze campaign press secretary, said in a news
release.
   She said four persons involved had been reprimanded, and that a
letter of apology from campaign manager Thomas Winters would be
delivered to the Ohio State Lantern. The Celebrezze staff member
posed as a Lantern reporter.
   The staff involved have had their pay docked, including two
managers who did not authorize or condone the act, but accept
managerial responsibility, Swan said. The funds, some $500, will be
given to the Ohio State University School of Journalism, Ms. Swan
said.
   Curt Steiner, spokesman for the Voinovich campaign, dismissed
the incident as a staged event to make the Celebrezze campaign look
good.
   He noted previous allegations by Celebrezze that a television
company hired by Voinovich posed as a TV station news crew in
December to gain access to a Celebrezze news conference. Videotape
of the session subsequently was used in a Voinovich commercial
critical of Celebrezze.

<HEAD>Cake is Clue: Sweet Talk For Drug Chief Bennett</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cake was the tipoff that drug control
chief William Bennett was not going to face many tough questions
from a key Democratic senator on the first anniversary of the war
on drugs.
   ``It's been a year and I think you've made some great
progress,'' Senate Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden told Bennett
after giving him the chocolate-iced cake outside the hearing room.
   Bennett had no problem with that assessment. The two also agreed
that much remains to be done and that Congress must be pushed to
provide the money for that war even as it faces other problems such
as the Persian Gulf, the deficit, and the savings and loan crisis.
   In fact, the most severe critic of the Republican
administration's drug war was Sen. Arlen Specter, a Republican from
Pennsylvania.
   Like some House Democrats, Specter called for dividing federal
drug war money equally between law enforcement and treatment and
education. The breakdown is now almost 70 percent for law
enforcement, the rest for treatment and education.
   President Bush and Bennett marked the first anniversary of the
national drug control strategy Wednesday with a white paper showing
improvements in the drug war.
   The statistics cited declines in emergency room admissions for
cocaine and heroin, surveys showing Americans' increasing hostility
toward illegal drugs and increases in prices for cocaine and
decreases in its purity, indicating a reduction in supply.
   The wholesale price of a kilo of cocaine now ranges from $17,500
to $35,000, up from a range of $11,000 to $25,000 last year.
   But in 1984, Biden noted, the wholesale price was $40,000 to
$50,000.
   The number of cocaine-related emergency room cases declined
slightly last year to 42,145 at hospitals checked by the federal
government. Biden pointed out that those same emergency rooms had
only 10,248 cocaine-related cases in 1985.
   But Biden, D-Del., took pains not to blame Bennett.
   ``The fact that the problem is still extremely bad is not a
comment on what I consider the extremely good job you have been
doing,'' Biden told him.
   Bennett assured Biden that the drug issues remain a top priority
for Bush, who said Wednesday that the issue ``remains No. 1'' for
him despite the other crises that seem to preoccupy the White House
these days.
   ``We're not saying the (drug) war is over,'' Bennett said.
``We're certainly not saying it will be over soon.''
   Bennett said some communities were making more progress than
others largely because of local efforts, but he said the federal
government should take the lead to demonstrate the importance of
the matter to state and local governments.
   The Judiciary Committee issued a report Wednesday hailing as a
major success an increase in spending on Justice Department efforts
to combat drugs to more than $3.8 billion this year, $1.5 billion
over the 1989 level.
   The report also pointed to increases in drug agents, cocaine
prices and criminal convictions.
   Among major failures, though, it listed cuts in the ranks of the
Border Patrol and other agencies as well as relaxed controls on
some military assault-style weapons tied to the drug trade.
   The mixed review also contained praise for expanded treatment
facilities as well as concern that the administration may have
undercounted by as much as two-thirds the number of hardcore
cocaine addicts, which it put at 2.4 million.
   Bennett and Biden agreed Thursday to have their staffs work out
some common figures.
   Bruce Carnes of Bennett's office told Biden he believes the
Judiciary Committee's number is too high because it overcounts some
groups of the population such as those arrested, and the
government's figure is too low because it misses some groups such
as those who are incarcerated.

<HEAD>Oilmen to Give Soviets Production Tips; Look for Possible
Investments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American oilmen heading to the Soviet Union at
the behest of President Bush are prepared to share new technology
that might immediately boost Soviet oil production, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher said Thursday.
   The trip also will give U.S. businesses a chance to ``be in the
vanguard'' of potentially profitable ventures with the Soviets,
Mosbacher said.
   Fifteen chiefs of U.S. corporations and Mosbacher leave Saturday
for a six-day round of meetings with Soviet officials about what
kind of technical assistance the United States can give the Soviets
on oil production, housing, transportation, food processing and
telecommunications.
   The group will stop in Helsinki, Finland, on Sunday to meet with
President Bush after his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. The business leaders will meet with Gorbachev in Moscow
later in the week.
   ``It's a chance for (Bush) to sort of exchange ideas, give them
an update (and tell them) from a political and international
standpoint how important their mission is,'' Mosbacher said of the
Helsinki stop.
   Mosbacher told reporters that the U.S. oilmen had a decade's
worth of technological advances they could share that might help
the Soviet Union boost its production beyond the current 12 million
barrel-a-day output.
   For instance, he said, the Soviets are unfamiliar with the U.S.
practice of ``fracking,'' or pumping fluid and sand into a
formation to increase the drain of oil, Mosbacher said. Giving them
that expertise might have almost an immediate impact, he said.
   The Soviet Union, the world's largest oil producer, receives 70
percent of its hard currency from its oil. Improving production
would have a dramatic impact on the Soviet economy, Mosbacher said.
   American oil companies, as well, stand to gain because of the
potential joint profit ventures with the Soviets, he said.
   H. Leighton Steward, chairman of the Louisiana Land and
Exploration Co. of New Orleans, said the mission will allow him to
help Bush and could open investment possibilities for his oil
company.
   ``In our estimation, there is a tremendous amount of oil and gas
reserves still to be found'' in the Soviet Union, Steward said.
   He expects next week's trip to involve preliminary discussions
about new techniques rather than any specific proposals for new
drilling possibilities. Mosbacher said the oilmen might actually
visit Soviet oil fields.
   Steward and other oilmen making the trip, such as Chesley Pruet,
who owns an oil company based in El Dorado, Ark., said the effort
to boost Soviet oil production was crucial in light of the Middle
East situation.
   ``Their potential reserves are greater than all the reserves in
the Persian Gulf,'' Pruet said.
   American companies could help the Soviet Union's lagging oil
production by providing them with new technology, Steward said.
   ``One reason the Russians are not further along is they simply
have been short of funds. They simply haven't had the capital to
bring themselves up to date technologically,'' Steward said.
   At the Houston economic summit of industrial nations in July,
the Bush administration balked at providing the Soviet Union with
cash grants or loans but agreed to provide the technical assistance.
   About 80 other nations receive American technical assistance,
which can range from teaching Tunisia about banking to developing a
fly-resistant wheat in Morocco.
   The U.S. business leaders also will discuss ways the Soviets
could improve their transportation system, housing situation and
food processing abilities _ all areas where the Soviets have asked
for help.
   Other companies that will be represented include:
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill.; Atlantic Richfield Co.
of Los Angeles; Chevron Corp., of San Francisco; Dresser Industries
of Dallas; Fortune magazine of New York; Glenair International of
Del Mar, Calif.
   Also, PaineWebber of New York; Pepsico Inc. of Purchase, N.Y.;
Sea-Land Service, Inc. of Edison, N.J.; Shelter Systems Group of
Hainesport, N.J.; Texaco Inc. of White Plains N.Y.; Transisco
Industries of San Francisco; and United Telecommunications of
Westwood, Kan.
   James B. Hayes, publisher of Fortune, said he thought he could
``contribute to the Soviets' understanding of free-market business
management techniques.''

<TEXT>
   Former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock,
forced from office after being convicted of hiding campaign
contributions, won a new trial today from the state Supreme Court
on his 12 perjury convictions.
   The court also set aside Hedgecock's remaining conviction, for
conspiracy to violate campaign disclosure laws, to let a San Diego
judge consider allegations that a bailiff improperly influenced
jurors by talking about the case and getting them liquor.
   In 1985, Hedgecock was convicted of failing to disclose more
than $350,000 in contributions to his successful 1983 campaign for
mayor. The money allegedly came from principals in J. David &amp; Co.,
an investment firm that later collapsed. Prosecutors said some of
the contributions violated local election laws.
   Hedgecock's one-year jail sentence and $1,000 fine have been
stayed during his appeal. He now works as a San Diego radio talk
show host.
   Hedgecock, 44, said today that he was confident the ruling ``is
going to be the beginning of setting the record straight on this
pretty unfortunate episode in my life and the life of San Diego.''
   The former mayor had contended he was guilty of no more than bad
bookkeeping, and claimed he was the target of a vendetta by
District Attorney Edwin Miller.
   Hedgecock said a retrial would be ``a horrifying waste of
resources (and) time.'' Miller's office had no immediate comment on
the ruling or on whether a retrial would be sought; a news
conference was scheduled for later in the day.
   The court voted 5-2 to overturn the perjury convictions on the
grounds that then-Superior Court Judge William Todd told the jury
that the alleged deliberate errors and omissions in Hedgecock's
campaign finance reports were ``material,'' or substantial enough
to support perjury charges.
   The issue of whether the inaccuracies were material was a
factual question to be decided by the jury, said the Supreme Court
opinion by Justice Joyce Kennard.
   The court ruled unanimously that a hearing could be held to
consider allegations that the conspiracy conviction was also
improper because the court bailiff purportedly made remarks that
pressured the jurors into convicting Hedgecock and supplied liquor
for a party the night before the verdict.
   Todd had dismissed those allegations on the basis of written
statements from jurors and the bailiff, saying he was not
authorized to call witnesses at a hearing.

   Two gunmen opened fire on a
crowded train platform, killing five people and wounding nine,
police said Thursday. Violence also continued in black townships.
   Col. Frans Malherbe said the attackers began shooting ``for no
rhyme or reason'' at the Jeppe station in Johannesburg. ``They
didn't say anything,'' Malherbe said. ``They just walked up and
opened fire.''
   All the victims were black, and so were the assailants, police
said. The gunmen fled the scene before authorities arrived.
   Earlier, police in the township of Soweto fired tear gas and
shotguns to disperse rival black factions in street clashes. Police
said at least one person was stabbed to death and 16 were injured.
Soweto residents said three people died.
   It was not known if the Johannesburg attack was linked to
township fighting between Zulu followers of the conservative
Inkatha movement and Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the African
National Congress.
   The clashes have claimed more than 550 lives since Aug. 12.
   Also Thursday, the ANC and government officials met in Pretoria
to discuss a no-violence pact, the status of ANC guerrillas, and
other issues. A radio station reported the groups would meet again
Tuesday. No statements were issued after meeting.
   The ANC formally suspended its 29-year guerrilla campaign Aug.
6. That improved prospects for negotiations on a new constitution
to give blacks a voice in national affairs.
   But ANC leader Nelson Mandela and other groups have pressed for
an independent probe into army involvement in the deaths of 11
people this week in Sebokeng.
   Black leaders, including the South African Council of Churches
and an Anglican group led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have accused
soldiers of opening fire unneccesarily.
   Some black leaders have accused police of fueling the violence
by siding with Inkatha. Police and the government deny the
accusation.
   The Star newspaper reported Thursday that masked white men
joined a group of blacks in attacking a Sebokeng migrant workers'
hostel before dawn Tuesday. It said the attack killed 19 people and
caused a crowd of township residents to gather at the hostel.
Soldiers later opened fire.
   In March, police fired on protesters in Sebokeng, killing five
and wounding 150. A special judicial review panel concluded the
gunfire was unjustified.
   President F.W. de Klerk said Thursday the continuing unrest
could hinder negotiations on black-white power sharing but that
talks would continue.
   ``There can be no real reform before stability,'' the president
said.
   The white-led government and the ANC, the main black opposition
group, have been holding periodic talks since May.
   In Pretoria on Thursday, Law and Order Minister Minister Adriaan
Vlok led the government delegation. The ANC group was headed by
Jacob Zuma, a member of its policy-making National Executive
Committee. Only three of the seven ANC members appointed to meet
with the government showed up.
   The man named to lead the ANC group, Chris Hani, was not present.
   He has been in the nominally independent Transkei homeland since
the government dropped him from a list of ANC leaders granted
temporary amnesty to participate in peace talks. Hani, leader of
the ANC's armed wing, has said the ANC would seize power if talks
with the government break down.
   De Klerk says he wants to end the apartheid system of racial
segregation and negotiate a constitution with opposition groups.
But he opposes black majority rule and a one-man, one-vote system.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, meanwhile, the fourth International
Conference Against Apartheid in Sport ended Thursday with delegates
urging a tightening of boycotts against South African athletes.
   Despite recent political changes in South Africa, the conference
said relaxing the boycotts ``would seriously prejudice'' progress
toward ending apartheid.
   Sports officials from South Africa and black African nations are
scheduled to hold formal talks for the first time in Harare,
Zimbabwe, Nov. 3-4. Officials from the International Olympic
Committee will attend.

<HEAD>Textile Workers' Booster Has Bought Suits in South Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South Carolina Democrat Ernest F. Hollings,
the Senate's biggest booster of protecting the jobs of U.S. textile
and apparel workers from import competition, has had suits
custom-made in South Korea.
   At the request of U.S. Embassy officials, Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., two weeks ago brought back a custom-made suit from South
Korea that Hollings had a Seoul tailor sew from U.S.-made fabric.
   Lugar was one of 32 senators who in July voted against a
Senate-passed bill by Hollings that would restrict imports of
clothing and fabrics in order to ``keep up the standard of living''
of U.S. textile and apparel workers.
   The House is expected to act later this month on the bill, which
was twice vetoed by former President Reagan. President Bush has
opposed the bill and administration officials have said they will
urge him to veto it also.
   A spokesman for Lugar described his boss' action as ``a simple
personal favor'' for a colleague, saying the embassy had asked
Lugar if he would deliver the suit to Hollings.
   Hollings, whose state is one of the largest manufacturers of
textiles and clothing, is not willing to talk about the suit, his
spokesman, John Patterson, said Thursday.
   The Washington Post quoted the owner of the Seoul shop as saying
he charged Hollings $100 to sew the suit together from wool fabric
the senator had sent him. The tailor also said Hollings had bought
suits in his shop during visits to South Korea in 1988 and 1989.

   The National Research Council on Thursday
called for major reforms in biology education including classroom
study of ``creepy crawly critters'' and games of ``What if...?''
   Biology education in America is hampered by teachers who are
poorly trained, books written to not offend adults and a curriculum
that ``seems designed to snuff out interest,'' according to a study
released by the council, an affiliate of the National Academy of
Sciences.
   ``By a variety of criteria, the nation is doing a poor job in
teaching science,'' said Timothy Goldsmith, a Yale biology
professor.
   Goldsmith, one of the biologists and educators who wrote the
study, pointed to unflattering comparisons of American students'
test results with their foreign counterparts and steadily declining
interest in science among U.S. students.
   Goldsmith said biology and all other sciences should be taught
in ways that are more interesting and personal to the children.
   ``The entire curriculum... needs to emphasize science as a
process of understanding _ an open-ended game of `What if ...?' and
`What else could that possibly mean?' _ rather than a stupefying
exercise in memorizing terminology,'' he said.
   Jane Butler Kahle, a science professor at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio, said science teaching should be a ``hands-on
process'' where elementary children can study mice, hamsters,
mealworms _ ``those creepy crawly critters'' _ and examine their
environment.
   Middle school programs should emphasize human biology, she said,
while high schools focus on laboratory investigative activities and
more core concepts.
   The experts said children aren't spending enough time on
science. They should start learning it young, preferably age 5,
they said, and should spend at least an hour a day on it _
preferably in the morning when they are more open to learning.
   Kahle said science education now takes a mere 18 minutes a day
in most kindergarten through third grade classes and up to 26
minutes for children in fourth through sixth grades.
   Textbooks, teachers and testing also could use improvement, the
report said.
   Textbooks are often too long, abysmally crafted and written
``with the implicit aim of avoiding offense to a scientifically
illiterate segment of the adult population,'' it said.
   The panel also said schools of education, where teachers are
taught to teach, ``present pedagogical information so unrelated to
the specifics of teaching science as to be of little or no help.''
   ``Too many of our teachers are recruited from the lowest
academic quartile of the college population,'' said the study,
adding that teachers are given little opportunity to update their
scientific knowledge or to interact with research scientists in
industry or academia.
   The study also recommended that testing be revised so it does
not drive the curriculum.
   The report was prepared by three committees that included more
than 50 educators and scientists from many parts of the country and
selected by the National Research Council.

<HEAD>Administration Cautiously Endorses Colombian Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Thursday cautiously
endorsed the Colombian government's offer to spare cocaine
traffickers extradition to the United States if they surrender and
confess their crimes.
   ``If the government and people of Colombia are now able to
enforce their own laws against drug trafficking _ prosecuting,
convicting, and incarcerating these thugs _ so much the better,''
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
   But Thornburgh warned that ``if the so-called extraditables fail
to take advantage of this opportunity to surrender, confess their
crimes, and serve jail sentences, we will continue to support
Colombia's effort to arrest and extradite them to the United States
for trial.''
   Under the decree issued Wednesday by recently inaugurated
President Cesar Gaviria, drug lords wanted by U.S. authorities
would not be extradited if they surrender and cooperate with
Colombian efforts to root out the cocaine cartels.
   Thornburgh and William Bennett, national drug policy director,
both praised the announcement.
   Thornburgh said the prosecution of drug traffickers in Colombia
would satisfy the Bush administration's goal ``to seize these drug
kingpins and bring them to justice.''
   ``There can be no substitute for the removal of these
traffickers from society and the dismantling of the drug
organizations they operate,'' Thornburgh said.
   Under the decree announced by Gaviria, Colombian judges would be
empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess and
cooperate with local investigations.
   Gaviria also announced plans to build ``fortress cities'' where
Colombian judges will live and work free of intimidation from the
drug lords.
   Bennett's chief spokesman, Benjamin F. Banta IV, said the drug
policy director ``thinks this is a good and positive step by the
new Colombian government to help in the war on drugs.''
   The offer of leniency and a promise that drug traffickers wanted
in the United States won't be extradited provide an incentive for
many suspects to surrender, Banta said.
   A senior law enforcement official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, called the decree a ``gutsy political move'' in a
country where extradition is a touchy political issue.
   Gaviria's offer appeared to be, at least in part, a response to
repeated offers from the drug traffickers to surrender to Colombian
judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had
been resumed last year by then-President Virgilio Barco.
   Barco's decree touched off a declaration of ``total war'' by the
Medellin cartel. Since then, 22 Colombians have been extradited to
face federal drug charges in the United States.
   Twelve have either been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty;
one was acquitted. An additional nine are awaiting trial.
   Two others were killed in shootouts with Colombian authorities.
   The Justice Department has asked for extradition of 16 suspects
in Colombian custody and the Bogota government has so far agreed to
turn over three of the accused drug traffickers, said spokesman Dan
Eramian.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starving people broke into a warehouse
Thursday, accidentally setting it ablaze, and the West African
military force sent to try to end Liberia's civil war said at least
20 people were killed.
   The city has been cut off from the outside world for more than
two months because of the war, and its last food stocks were
exhausted this week. Doctors said some children had begun dying of
starvation.
   Further details of the fire deaths were not available.
   Except for a few fishing boats that dared enter the city with
their catches, no new food was arriving in Monrovia.
   Thousands of people seeking food mobbed the five-nation
intervention force. But the soldiers had little to offer and were
waiting themselves for rations.
   Rebels loyal to Charles Taylor ended the several-day lull in
fighting in the capital by shelling the city's small airfield.
   Commanders of the West African force had hoped to open the field
to flights soon, but the attack made it clear they would have to
drive Taylor's rebels out of range of the strip before operations
can resume.
   Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara urged West African states and
the international community to send food to Liberia. Jawara heads
the West African regional group that sent 3,000 soldiers to Liberia
in an effort to end the 8-month-old tribal war, which has claimed
at least 5,000 lives.
   Ghana, Gambia, Nigeria, Guinea and Sierra Leone have contributed
troops to the force, created by the Economic Community of West
African States.
   The Ghanian commander of the intervention force, Lt. Gen. Arnold
Quainoo, met Jawara this week to press for emergency food aid.
   Jawara also met this week with Burkina Faso leader Capt. Blaise
Compaore, who has criticized deployment of the intervention force.
Compaore has been accused of supporting Taylor's efforts to force
the West African soldiers to leave Liberia.
   Jawara said Compaore promised to try to use his influence with
Taylor to accept a cease-fire.
   Liberia's president, Samuel Doe, and Taylor's rival rebel
leader, Prince Johnson, welcomed the arrival of the intervention
force and have observed an informal cease-fire.
   Taylor has refused any compromise but has been unable to capture
Monrovia.
   The fighting began began Dec. 24 when the rebels invaded from
neighboring Ivory Coast, accusing Doe of corruption.
   The war has driven more than 500,000 refugees into Ivory Coast,
Sierra Leone and Guinea, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
reported.
   Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Guinea have not been able to
provide much help to the refugees in their countries because their
governments are deeply in debt and face serious budget problems.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Thursday
that Britain plans to step up its deployment to the Persian Gulf,
saying the United Nations has already taken sufficient steps to
allow military force against Iraq.
   ``To use no military force without the further authority of the
Security Council would be to deprive ourselves of a right in
international law,'' Mrs. Thatcher told an emergency session of
Parliament.
   ``It would hand an advantage to Saddam Hussein and could put our
own forces in greater peril. For these reasons, I am not prepared
to limit our freedom of action,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher's remarks were jeered by the opposition, although
all of Britain's political parties are united in supporting
sanctions and backing participation in the U.S.-led military
buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   The governing Conservative Party and the opposition Labor Party
are divided over whether legal authority already exisits to use
force if sanctions fail to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock argued that military action without
new U.N. authority would enhance Iraq President Saddam Hussein's
stature among traditionally anti-Western Arab nations.
   ``The potential consequences of taking action that doesn't have
complete and unarguable U.N. authority include further turmoil,
terrorism, an increase in nationalism and fundamentalism the
destabilizing, possibly of strategic allies,'' he said.
   It was the first time that Parliament _ not due to return from
its summer break until Oct. 15 _ has been recalled for an emergency
sitting since the outbreak of the British-Argentine war over the
Falkland Islands in 1982.
   Saying the U.S. military deployment in the gulf deserved strong
support, Mrs. Thatcher noted that Britain had already contributed
three squadrons of warplanes and small numbers of ground forces to
guard airfields.
   ``We believe some additional forces will be needed and their
composition is under consideration,'' she said. She gave no further
details.
   Some U.S. congressmen argue that European nations should also
deploy large numbers of ground troops to underline joint
involvement.
   Mrs. Thatcher says sanctions should be given months to work, but
has insisted repeatedly that the military option cannot be ruled
out.
   ``History has many examples of perfidy and deceit,'' said Mrs.
Thatcher. ``This ranks high among them and shows that nothing that
Saddam Hussein says can be trusted. ... Iraq's actions go back to
the laws of the jungle.''
   She added, ``The person who takes such (action) against one
state will take it against another if he is not stopped and his
invasion reversed. ... We will persevere until he is.''

<HEAD>Parents, Students Don't Mind Juice Box Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOUTH PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elementary school pupils got a
lesson in civic responsibilty and environmental ethics Thursday and
were a little more thirsty because of it.
   Students streaming into Dora L. Small Elementary School couldn't
bring juice boxes for snack or lunchtime as part of Maine's ban on
the popular 8{-ounce containers. Maine is the first state in the
country to outlaw the boxes.
   Environmentalists contend the aseptic containers, made from
bonded layers of plastic, paper and aluminum, can't be recycled and
went against the state's goal of recycling half its solid waste by
1994.
   The ban took effect Saturday, just before the school year began.
The boxes weigh less than glass or metal, they're unbreakable and
are easy to stash in a lunchbox or backpack.
   Many parents said they didn't mind the ban.
   But they admitted that packing something for their children to
drink is a little harder without being able to use the handy,
single-serving containers of juice and fruit drink that come with
straws.
   ``It's a pain,'' said Sheri Allen, whose daughter Amy is a first
grader at Small School. ``I used them and I've stopped using them.
Now, my daughter doesn't have anything to drink at snack time,
that's what it amounts to because I can't fit two thermoses in her
lunchbox.''
   Kathy Duca, whose two children attend nursery school, said she
liked using the juice boxes and isn't sure the ban is fair.
   ``I agree the juice box containers aren't good for the
environment,'' she said. ``But I don't think they can just get rid
of one thing when there are so many other materials that pollute
the environment, like plastic containers.''
   Several said keeping Maine's environment clean is worth the
sacrifice.
   ``If it's not recyclable, we shouldn't use it,'' said Wendy
Athearn as she walked to school with her son, a kindergarten pupil.
``We've got to do something with all this trash building up.''
   ``I agree with the ban completely,'' added Kathie Barton,
another parent with her children in tow. ``I also think milk
cartons should be banned.''
   Other parents, like Ted O'Meara, said the ban hasn't been a
problem. ``My son's been bringing extra juice in a thermos.''
   His son, Ben, a first grader at Small, shrugged his shoulders
and wrinkled his nose when asked if he minded not being able to
drink juice boxes anymore.
   Other pupils also seemed oblivious to the ban, shrugging their
shoulders or giving blank stares when asked about the new law.
   Sharon Langella, the school's secretary, said she hadn't heard
any complaints from parents.

   Two potentially deadly kinds of viral
encephalitis have reached high levels among virus-carrying
mosquitoes in at least five states, federal health officials said
Thursday.
   Only seven cases of St. Louis encephalitis and two cases of
Eastern equine encephalitis have been confirmed in humans in the
United States this year, the Centers for Disease Control said. But
testing of mosquitoes this summer has detected ``unusually early
and high levels'' of the viruses, the CDC said.
   CDC researchers warned that encephalitis is a potentially deadly
illness, with fatality rates as high as 30 percent. Symptoms
include fever, headache, stiff neck and, in serious cases,
nervous-system disturbances.
   The last major outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, the most
common type, struck nearly 3,000 people 15 years ago.
   ``In different locations, the risk is going to be different,''
said Dr. Ted Tsai, a Colorado-based encephalitis specialist with
the CDC. ``Only certain mosquitoes carry these viruses. Only vector
mosquitoes are capable of transmitting infections.''
   The CDC reported high levels of encephalitis viruses in
Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, New York and New Jersey,
``indicating a potential risk for epidemic transmission.''
   In Massachusetts, which has had heavy rainfall _ good for
mosquitoes _ for two years, the risk was anticipated, the CDC said.
One 7-year-old boy has been diagnosed with Eastern equine
encephalitis, and four more human cases are suspected.
   Officials ordered the spraying of 700,000 acres in swampy
southeastern Massachusetts with the pesticide malathion, but the $1
million program was harshly criticized when thousands of tiny fish
died, apparently from fallout.
   ``But if you don't do anything and there's a human case, the
public outcry is going to be, `You didn't do enough,' '' Tsai said.
   In Texas, tests in central Houston showed as many as 25 per
1,000 mosquitoes carrying St. Louis encephalitis virus. As many of
60 percent of wild birds showed signs of infection.
   Two human cases were confirmed; both patients died.
   In Florida, high St. Louis encephalitis infection rates were
noticed in flocks of chickens. Five human cases were confirmed, and
a sixth was suspected, in three central Florida counties.
   In New York and New Jersey, tests have shown high Eastern equine
encephalitis infection rates in groups of mosquitoes.
   Elsewhere, a fatal case of Eastern equine encephalitis has been
reported in South Carolina, a presumed case has been found in North
Carolina, and cases in horses have been reported in Georgia and
Maryland.
   Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. St. Louis
encephalitis, about 5 percent fatal in humans, and Eastern equine
encephalitis, about 30 percent fatal, are part of a family of
viruses known as arboviruses.
   Federal health officials reported 108 cases of various arboviral
encephalitis types last year.

   After a month of worrying and waiting, Donnita Cole got good
news Thursday: Her husband is alive and well in Baghdad.
   ``I had a good crying spell this morning and now I am
fantastic,'' said Mrs. Cole, of Odessa, Texas. ``My adrenalin surge
is so powerful right now that I can't even sit down.''
   While some other American families celebrated the return of a
loved one from Iraq and Kuwait, Mrs. Cole was momentarily happy
with the knowledge that her husband, John Cole, was alive and
apparently in good health at a Baghdad hotel.
   She said her husband sent her a message through the State
Department, saying, ``I am all right and in Iraq.''
   Still, Mrs. Cole said she won't rest easy until her husband is
home. He had been working in Kuwait as a supervisor for OGE
Drilling of Houston.
   ``The message calms my fears right now,'' she said, ``but that
does not tell me what tomorrow's going to bring. I am living hour
to hour, minute to minute. Anything could change that quickly.''
   For the Subh family of Davenport, Iowa, the waiting ended
Wednesday when 15-year-old Taleb Subh returned from Kuwait.
   ``I don't know how to describe it,'' said his father, Nabil
Subh. ``I'm very, very moved. I can't believe I'm holding him right
now.''
   Taleb had been visiting relatives in Kuwait City when Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``It was great. Kuwait City was beautiful,'' he said, ``but then
I woke up and it was just changed. It was like going to a different
country. You see soldiers, you don't see people anymore.''
   His father said a Palestinian identification card that officials
of the Palestine Liberation Organization gave to Taleb helped get
him through some checkpoints in Iraq. He left Baghdad on Tuesday
along with 23 other Americans who had been held hostage in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   Taleb sounded anxious to get home when he was approached by
reporters during a stop at Newark International Airport in New
Jersey. ``I'd like to talk to you all, but I have a lot to do,'' he
said.
   After an emotional reunion at O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago with his parents, his two brothers and his sister, he was a
little more expansive, despite having gone more than 60 hours
without sleep.
   ``I want to get back to school and do what I was doing before,''
he said. ``I plan to kick back and relax.''
   Another American freshly back from the Persian Gulf conceded
Thursday that he may have been a bit hasty when he sharply
criticized the State Department for failing to do enough to get
Americans out of Kuwait and Iraq.
   ``My remarks regarding the State Department may have been a
little wild, because my wife tells me as far as she knows they have
been making every effort to get us out of Kuwait,'' Lloyd
Culbertson said in an interview in El Paso, Texas.
   ``If that's true, I'm sorry I told the reporters what I did,''
he said.
   But later in the same interview, Culbertson said: ``I am not
sorry for what I said about the State Department.''
   Culbertson, 76, was trapped in Kuwait for about a month after
Iraq invaded the country. He was among 47 Americans allowed to
leave Kuwait after the Rev. Jesse Jackson's meeting with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. He returned to Texas on Sunday.
   ``If it were not for the grace of God and Jesse Jackson, we
would not be here,'' Culbertson said Sunday when he arrived at
Washington-Dulles International Airport. ``The State Department has
not lifted a finger for us.''
   ``I don't agree with Jesse Jackson's political beliefs,'' he
said Thursday. ``But he got me out. Shouldn't I say thank you? I
was worried for my life at times and he got me out.''

<TEXT>
   The jailed daughter of 1960s LSD guru Timothy
Leary died of an apparent suicide two days after she was found
hanging by a shoelace from the bars in her cell, authorities said
Thursday.
   Susan F. Martino, 42, was found Monday hanging in her cell at
the Sybil Brand Institute, where she was in custody after being
judged mentally unfit to stand trial on a charge of shooting her
sleeping boyfriend.
   Martino, who was taken unconscious from the jail to Santa Marta
Hospital, died Wednesday evening, said Mary Landreth, a Sheriff's
Department spokeswoman.
   Pending an autopsy, the death was classified a possible suicide
hanging, said coroner's office spokesman Bob Dambacher.
   ``I can't talk right now. I'm upset,'' the 70-year-old Leary
said from his Beverly Hills home.
   ``She was found by deputies Monday morning ... during a routine
20-minute cell block check,'' Landreth said. ``Martino was hanging
by a shoelace attached to her cell bars. Martino was alone in her
cell.''
   In May 1989, Martino was committed to the jail's mental health
unit until doctors could find her psychologically fit to stand
trial for attempted murder.
   Martino was accused of shooting boyfriend Joel Chavira, 38, as
he took a nap Dec. 19, 1988. He survived the attack and told
officers he found Martino holding a gun in the kitchen of her
Glendale home.
   Chavira, who was hospitalized briefly, told police Martino
denied shooting him. The woman's daughter also said she had not
fired the shot.
   Martino pleaded innocent in January 1989 to a charge of
attempted murder.
   At the time, her father said, ``I am extremely distressed about
this tragic event. I am praying for the young man's continued
recovery.''

   Swiss-born American photographer Robert Frank
is donating works representing his entire 45-year career to the
National Gallery of Art for its photography collection, gallery
officials announced Thursday.
   The Frank archive includes 61 vintage photographs, negatives
from about 2,000 rolls of film, 2,296 contact sheets, nearly 1,000
work prints and 34 pictures bound in a volume titled ``Black, White
and Things.''
   Gallery director J. Carter Brown said the gifts by Frank,
regarded as one of the leading photographers of the post-World War
II period, will be ``unrivaled by any other private or public
holding of his work.''
   The gifts will be included in a National Gallery exhibition of
Frank's works in 1992. The archive ranges from Frank's earliest
works as a student in Switzerland in the 1940s to recent images
from the late 1980s.
   They will join a photography collection that includes the first
such gift to the National Gallery, a set of 1,600 Alfred Stieglitz
pictures donated by artist Georgia O'Keeffe in 1949. The gallery's
collection has expanded in recent years with gifts of more than 260
pictures by Ansel Adams, Walker Evans and Paul Strand.

<TEXT>
   President Bush was upgraded to first
class Thursday when a Boeing 747 jumbo jet made its first official
flight as the new Air Force One.
   ``It's marvelous in every way _ the latest in technology and
certainly very, very comfortable,'' Bush said as he stepped aboard
the plane for a quick hop across the country for political rallies
in Topeka, Kan., and Tallahassee, Fla.
   The president planned to be back at the White House Thursday
evening.
   ``It's so much roomier. My heavens,'' Bush said. ``It is
magnificent.''
   Some of the stewards chided reporters not to scuff up the new
airplane.
   ``Be careful those cameras don't scratch the walls,'' one said.
   Congress and the Reagan administration decided in 1986 to spend
a quarter billion dollars on a pair of jumbo jets to replace two
well-preserved but aging Boeing 707s that had flown a total of 5.5
million miles. The delivery was almost two years late.
   For a president who already has logged a record 200,000 miles in
the air in less than 20 months in office, the new jet will allow
Bush to whet his appetite for travel and comfort.
   The comforts range from a shower-equipped presidential lavatory
to an airborne office with a large wooden desk to a fully decked
conference room that could accommodate more than half the Cabinet.
   The seats throughout the jet are first-class size; Bush and his
top staff have large leather reclining chairs.
   There are televisions galore, 85 telephones, the latest in
computers, memory typewriters, a paper shredder, two galleys with
ovens and microwaves and, for the president and first lady, a
spacious private cabin with two couches that convert to twin-size
beds. There's enough freezer space on the plane to store 2,000
meals.
   The White House physician could perform emergency surgery in a
separate medical room.
   The plane has a range of 7,140 miles without refueling _ about
1,400 miles further than the old Air Force One _ and an airborne
refueling capacity that will be used only in emergencies.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it's more
fuel-efficient and quieter than the old Air Force Ones, which
exceeded Federal Aviation Administration noise standards.
   Bush invited reporters _ but not camera crews or photographers _
to glimpse his private suite in the nose of the plane. His private
quarters are decorated in brown and rust tones, with an upholstered
wall mural depicting a rustic sunset.
   Asked if he planned any one-day trips to the Persian Gulf, Bush
quipped: ``Stay tuned. Have plane, will travel.''
   Bush said he checked out the cockpit, but the onetime Navy
fighter pilot said he had no plans to take the controls.
   ``A little sitting there maybe, but I wouldn't understand how to
start this thing,'' Bush said.
   Col. Danny Barr, the Air Force One pilot since 1989, was at the
controls of the new jet.
   The president's first landing in Topeka was bumpier than the
usual smooth setdowns for which Air Force One is famous but the
plane had a smoother landing in Tallahassee.
   Bonnie Newman, the president's assistant for management and
administration, flew several trial runs on the jet, including a
trip last week to Hawaii when she became the first passenger to try
the presidential shower.
   ``It was refreshing,'' she said with a laugh.
   While the contract called for the government to pay $266 million
for the two jumbo jets, the actual cost reportedly ran closer to
$400 million. White House officials say Boeing absorbed much of the
overrun. The second plane is to be delivered next year.
   The new plane has separate cabins for guests, Bush's senior
staff and other aides as well as for his Secret Service contingent
and the press corps that travels with him.
   It seats 70 passengers and 23 crew members, half again as many
as the old plane. It provides room for two additional members of
the media _ a total of 13 reporters, photographers and television
crews.
   The passengers on the maiden flight had nine movies to choose
from, viewed on overhead televisions in each cabin with the sound
provided by individual headsets. Thursday's offerings included
``The Abyss,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' ``Young
Einstein'' and ``Steel Magnolias.''
   The walls of the plane were bare, but officials said photos
would be hung.
   The outside of the jet is decorated in the same colors President
John F. Kennedy chose for the Air Force One put into service in
1962: white and royal blue over a thin gold stripe, with the bottom
and the big cowlings for the engines in robin's egg blue.
   The old Air Force One featured a single narrow center aisle,
where VIPs had to weave their way past flight attendants, Secret
Service agents and the media on their way to the lavatories.
   Flight attendant Becky Schulz said it will be more work running
around the longer two-story plane, but will mean ``a lot less
stress.''
   ``You won't be stepping over people's feet all the time,'' she
said.

   The family of a Utah man fatally stabbed in a
Manhattan subway station demanded justice Thursday, urging people
to get involved and challenging New York City to safeguard its
public transit users.
   ``Please don't let Brian die in vain,'' the family of Brian
Watkins pleaded in a statement after his parents canceled a news
conference.
   Watkins, 22, was stabbed Sunday night when he tried to intervene
as a group of youths robbed his father and punched his mother in
the face.
   The parents, Sherwin and Karen Watkins, returned from New York
Wednesday night after testifying before a grand jury. They had
scheduled a news conference at a hotel in their hometown, but
decided on the advice of prosecutors not to go through with it.
   ``We advised them it would not be in the interest of the case,''
said Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for the Manhattan district
attorney's office.
   Instead, the Watkins' 26-year-old son, Todd, read a 10-minute
statement to reporters on behalf of the family as his parents,
looking haggard, were seated nearby.
   ``We challenge the public transportation system of New York City
to hire competent people and train them to react in emergencies and
reward and discipline them for their services,'' has ``a quiet guy. He
has
problems and has seizures and takes pills for them.''
   The youth had a seizure last week, Abercrombie said, and another
student made fun of him. But police would not speculate on the
reasons for the hostage-taking.

<HEAD>Environmental Group Denounces Helms; Lists 12 `Dirtiest' in
Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with criticism from Right-to-Life
Committee</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   An environmental lobby group named its
congressional ``dirty dozen'' Thursday and presented Sen. Jesse
Helms with what it called a ``lifetime achievement award'' for
opposing environmental legislation.
   ``While many other lawmakers have been acquiring the knowledge
that pollution imperils our communities and our planet, Helms has
been acquiring the seniority to help thwart efforts to protect our
air and water,'' said Ruth Caplan, executive director of
Environmental Action.
   ``It's his cumulative record that's so bad,'' Caplan said at a
news conference, contending Helms has voted consistently against
environmental issues the lobby group supports.
   Helms' office did not immediately return telephone calls seeking
comment.
   Helms, R-N.C., was first named to the list in 1978 but wasn't
one of 1990's ``dirty dozen.''
   The group's latest list includes three senators and nine members
of the House. The only Democrat among them is Sen. Howell Heflin of
Alabama.
   The other senators are Minority Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming and
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
   The House members are: Bob Michel, R-Ill.; Larry Craig, R-Idaho;
Bill Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; Bill Emerson, R-Mo.; Clyde Holloway,
R-La.; James Inhofe, R-Okla.; Stan Parris, R-Va.; Denny Smith,
R-Ore.; and Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn.
   Debbie Locker, a spokeswoman for Heflin, said the rating was
based on a limited number of votes and did not take into account
Heflin's overall environmental record during his 12 years in the
Senate.
   ``Sen. Heflin is for doing anything to protect the environment
as long as it does not mean people in Alabama will lose their
jobs,'' she said.
   Stangeland spokesman Tom Hanson said Environmental Action was
highlighting a few test votes and ignoring Stangeland's role as a
leader in reaching compromises on environmental issues.
   ``He looks for solutions that are environmentally safe and
economically sound,'' Hanson said.
   McConnell's re-election campaign manager, Steven Law, said the
senator's top priority was protecting jobs in Kentucky's
energy-dependent economy.
   ``The problem is that Kentucky relies heavily on its coal,
uranium and oil exploration industries,'' Law said in Louisville.
``You cannot possibly satisfy these left-wing Washington groups and
also protect Kentucky jobs.''
   Environmental Action charted 12 votes in the Senate and House
that it considered this year's most important on such issues as
clean air, oil spills, water pollution and world population
control. Each member's record in key committee votes and on
home-district environmental issues was also taken into account,
Caplan said.
   Environmental Action has issued a dirty dozen list in every
congressional election year since 1970, except for 1980 and 1982.
In 1984 the list was made up of Reagan administration officials
instead of members of the House and Senate.
   Environmental Action, a research, education and lobby group,
says it has about 20,000 members nationwide.
   The National Right to Life Committee criticized the inclusion of
the population-control vote, which would have earmarked $15 million
for the United Nations Population Fund.
   Under current law, U.S. tax dollars cannot go to the fund
because it operates programs in China, which uses forced abortions
and sterilizations to carry out its one-child-per-family policy.
   ``It is an outrageous distortion to claim that a congressman is
anti-environment because he opposes compulsory abortion,'' said
Douglas Johnson, the committee's legislative director.
   Caplan said the vote was included because ``the pressure of
population growth on the environment can undo all the progress we
have made.''

   Historic talks this week between the
prime ministers of North and South Korea were hard to capsulize,
even for the participants themselves. They frequently resorted to
proverbs.
   ``Where there is a will, there is a way,'' said the North Korean
arrival statement by An Byong Su, director of the Committee for
Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland.
   ``There is a saying that too many captains make the boat climb
the mountain (instead of sail on the water),'' North Korean Premier
Yon Hyong Muk told his South Korean counterpart on the first day of
talks.
   ``If we make haste, the boat will capsize,'' replied South
Korean Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon.
   ``Nothing ventured, nothing gained,'' Kang said later in a
dinner speech.

   Clothes may not make the person, but they do have impact.
   One noticeable difference between the 90 North Koreans visiting
this week and their countrymen who visited on a small exchange
program five years ago was clothes.
   In 1985, all the men wore the same suits, the same shoes, the
same ties and the same shirts.
   This week there was variety in color and style. Some reports
described the visitors as having a new cosmopolitan look, and one
newspaper claimed to have placed a spy in the hotel laundry who
found foreign labels, mostly from Eastern Europe or Japan.
   Two things were the same, however: the North Korean men all wore
their hair brushed straight back in a style favored by Communist
ruler Kim Il Sung. And all wore a lapel pin bearing Kim's picture.

   Gen. Kim Kwang Jin, 72, vice minister of the armed forces, told

drove as far south as the central town of Taegu during the 1950-53
Korean War.
   ``Years have elapsed since the bloody war,'' he said. ``I come
now to reunify the nation, not by rifle or tanks but through
dialogue.''
   North Korea invaded the South to start the war, which ended in
an armistice. A peace treaty has never been signed.

   Seoul Mayor Koh Kun bemoaned a dilemma common to big cities

   He didn't need to elaborate for the visiting North Koreans. The
official motorcade taking the delegation to its hotel was involved
in a five-car accident.
   Two North Korean delegates were injured. The North Korean
premier's car was damaged, and two of the official vehicles had to
be left for tow trucks.

<TEXT>
   Talks between officials from Estonia and the
Soviet parliament were suspended Thursday after the Soviet side
announced it had no authority to engage in negotiations, Estonian
media reported.
   The Estonian side accused the Soviets of ``unprofessional''
conduct, because both sides signed a protocol three weeks ago
agreeing to negotiations on the political and economic relations
between the independence-minded republic and the Soviet Union,
according to the Estonian News Service.
   On Tuesday, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis accused
the Soviets of delaying the start of independence negotiations with
that republic, refusing to reply to its suggestions on the start of
negotiations.
   Representatives of the Baltic republics say the Soviets may be
stalling on negotiations because Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have
said they will seek full independence and won't sign a union
treaty. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been promoting
the treaty to try to keep the nation of 15 republics from
splintering.
   ``It is clear that those were right who said that (the Soviets
agreed to the) talks not to reach an outcome but just for the sake
of talks,'' Andrei Birov, the Estonian delegation's spokesman, said
in an interview with the Estonian Telegraph Agency.
   Thursday's session at the Kremlin between the Soviet and the
Estonian parliamentary delegations was the third round of talks.
During the second round, on Aug. 30, Soviet delegation chief
Nikolai Gritsenko started to use the word ``consultations'' instead
of ``negotiations,'' the Estonian News Service quoted Ulo Nugis,
the head of the Estonian delegation, as saying.
   On Thursday, Gritsenko said the Soviet delegation was authorized
``only to hold consultations,'' and later added: ``We can hold
negotiations only between independent states, but Estonia is only a
Soviet republic, according to the Soviet Constitution,'' the news
service reported.
   It was then decided that the meetings between the Estonian and
Soviet delegations would be halted temporarily and only groups of
experts from both sides will continue contacts, it added.
   ``In my mind, the reason for such behavior is an understanding
that Estonia will not join the new union treaty,'' said Endel
Lippman, an Estonian government minister who is in charge of
negotiations with the Soviets.
   The official news agency Tass, in its account of Thursday's
events, said the delegations met ``as part of continuing
consultations between the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet and the Estonian
leadership'' and did not report the suspension of the talks.
   Last month, Estonia's parliament declared that the constitution
of the Estonia Soviet Socialist Republic was no longer effective
and that Estonia was not a part of the Soviet Union.
   The declaration was part of a package defining the basis for
Estonia's independence negotiations with Kremlin representatives.
   On March 30, Estonia declared a transition period toward
independence. Gorbachev rejected that move, as well as a similar
step by Latvia and an outright declaration of independence by
Lithuania.

<HEAD>Democrats Still Seeking $50 Billion in Deficit Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders of both parties said
Thursday they still want $50 billion in deficit cuts for next year,
despite the Persian Gulf crisis and the weak economy.
   Their comments came on the eve of the resumption of budget
bargaining between Congress and the Bush administration. White
House officials said President Bush will participate for about 90
minutes Friday when negotiators meet at Andrews Air Force Base in
suburban Maryland.
   Since the negotiations broke off in August for Congress' summer
recess, some participants for both sides have suggested working for
a somewhat smaller deficit-reduction package, perhaps in the $30
billion to $40 billion range. They say such a plan would be less of
a shock to the U.S. economy, which has shown signs of slowing.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, House
Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., told reporters that negotiators should stick to
the goals they were working toward when the talks recessed: $50
billion next year, and $500 billion over the next five years.
   Gephardt said Democrats also want the package to protect the
poor and middle class, encourage U.S. energy security and prod
economic growth.
   ``The health of our economy and the living standards of our
people demand no less,'' he said.
   Separately, House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said they also believed
the $50 billion-$500 billion formula should be negotiators' goal.
   ``Hopefully it is time to make the tough choices,'' Dole told
reporters.
   Bush has been saying publicly for weeks that he wants to work
toward a $50 billion package for next year.
   Democrats and Republicans met separately on Capitol Hill
Thursday, making last-minute preparations for their bargaining.
Their aim is to work out a deal by Monday.
   Congressional leaders and White House officials hope that, with
the negotiators secluded on the air force base, chances will
improve for a bipartisan compromise.
   They also suggest that the setting _ and the fact that the base
generally is closed to reporters _ might cut down on partisan
posturing on both sides.
   Administration officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said Bush would fly by helicopter to the air base to
open the bargaining session on Friday morning and remain for about
90 minutes.
   He will return to Andrews later in the day to fly to Helsinki
for his one-day meeting on Sunday with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   Administration officials said Bush does not plan to participate
directly in the budget-summit talks after Friday's appearance
   Speaking at a Republican fund-raiser on Thursday in Topeka,
Kan., Bush said ``time is running out'' for finding a budget
agreement since the new fiscal year begins in just a few weeks.
   ``I've kept the faith _ and, yes, took some heat _ through five
long months of budget talks,'' Bush said.
   ``We've got to draw the line on spending, break free once and
for all from the tired old mindset that says for every new problem
we must create a new bureaucracy.''
   ``So I say, Congress get with it. ... The time for avoiding
tough decisions is gone. The time for action is now. Let's fix this
budget mess once and for all.''

   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
has canceled a planned October trip to the United States because of
the Persian Gulf crisis, a top official said Thursday.
   ``This trip definitely doesn't serve the interests of Nicaragua,
given the intense attention on the Persian Gulf conflict in the
minds of all the North American people,'' Minister of the
Presidency Antonio Lacayo said on his return from Washington. He
spoke in a radio interview.
   Mrs. Chamorro had planned to go to Washington to thank the
Organization of American States for assistance in the electoral
process that led to her Feb. 25 election victory over the
Sandinistas. Backed by a coalition, she defeated President Daniel
Ortega and took office April 25.
   She also was to meet with President Bush.
   Lacayo said the decision to cancel the trip was made by
Nicaragua.

   A Soviet spokesman on Thursday raised the
possibility of Kremlin support for a U.N. military force in the
Persian Gulf and said Mikhail S. Gorbachev may discuss the idea
with President Bush at their summit.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov did not make clear
whether the Kremlin envisioned U.N. troops acting independently or
replacing U.S.-led forces in the region.
   The Soviet Union has not sent troops to join the U.S.-led
multinational force deployed in the gulf since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2. It previously left open the possibility of
joining a U.N. force, but Gerasimov appeared to take this a step
further by raising the issue himself at a news conference.
   ``We have to go back to the U.N. charter and revive certain
clauses of this charter, in particular the clause about the
military staff committee, which may have armed forces _
international armed forces _ at its disposal so as to keep
international peace and security,'' he said.
   The committee consists of senior officers from the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: the United States,
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France. It has been inactive since
1946, but last month the United Nations Security Council said it
should play a role in enforcing sanctions against Iraq.
   Gerasimov said Gorbachev may raise the idea with Bush at
Sunday's meeting in Helsinki, Finland. Garasimov, however, said it
was unlikely the two nations would issue a joint ultimatum to Iraq
since the Kremlin prefers multilateral action.
   Although Iraq is a longtime ally of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev
has condemned its invasion of Kuwait and repeatedly called for
Iraqi troops to withdraw.
   In talks Wednesday with Gorbachev and other top officials in
Moscow, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz gave no indication his
country was willing to leave the oil-rich sheikdom, Gerasimov said.
   ``I see indications to the contrary, because ... Iraq is sending
its citizens and Palestinians into Kuwait and giving them documents
to live there permanently, which may change the demographic balance
in Kuwait,'' Gerasimov said. ``It's a small country ... so they can
change the demography, and then they can hold a referendum and vote
for Kuwait joining Iraq.''
   A senior Western diplomat commenting on Aziz's visit said, ``The
Soviets agreed to see him, but they said rather pointedly they
wanted to hear something new.'' The diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said he did not see evidence that Aziz
brought anything new to Moscow.
   The Soviet Union has voted for U.N. resolutions imposing an
economic embargo on Iraq and allowing the use of military force to
halt ships carrying goods to or from Iraqi ports.
   In recent years, U.N. troops have been deployed to troubled
areas to monitor cease-fire lines and try to keep the peace. Not
since the Korean War of 1950-53 and Congo rebellion of 1960-64 have
U.N. soldiers undertaken a ``police action.''
   The Korean and Congo forces were directed by the full Security
Council, not the military staff committee.
   Gerasimov dismissed a proposal by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
to link the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait to Israel's
pullback from its occupied territories.
   ``It is this aggression by Iraq that is on top of the agenda,
and I don't think we should link this aggression with any other
issue, otherwise the resolution of this conflict will be
indefinitely postponed,'' he said.
   Earlier Thursday, Aziz endorsed a call for an Islamic holy war
against Western forces on the Arabian peninsula and accused Bush of
being a bad Christian because he condemned the Iraqi invasion but
did not heed the plight of Palestinians living under Israeli
occupation.
   The Tass news agency reported Thursday that French President
Francois Mitterrand telephoned Gorbachev to discuss the gulf crisis
and other Mideast issues.
   Soviet media, meanwhile, have put the U.S. military involvement
in the gulf in a favorable light.
   The evening television news program ``Vremya,'' in a report from
Saudi Arabia, showed American soldiers mingling with their Saudi
counterparts.
   A Soviet correspondent said the United States ``did not leave
its longtime ally and oil donor Saudi Arabia alone to face their
opponent ... The Americans were the first to respond to their
distress signal.''

   An American trying to evade capture was shot
and wounded by an Iraqi soldier in Kuwait, the State Department
said Thursday.
   Iraqi officials say the unidentified man ``will be discharged
from the hospital within 24 hours, but will remain in their
custody. They promise us consular access at that time,'' said
agency spokesman Mark Dillen.
   Dillen, accusing the Iraqis of ``outrageous behavior,'' said the
man was wounded in the forearm while trying to escape out of a
window at his Kuwait apartment.
   The incident occurred as Iraq mandated a law imposing a sentence
of life imprisonment on people who try to leave the country without
permission.
   Meanwhile, an undisclosed number of American citizens are
expected to leave Kuwait and Iraq on Friday on what the State
Department hopes will be regular evacuation flights arranged by the
U.S. embassy.
   In addition to American women and children whom the Iraqis have
been allowing to leave since late last month, U.S. officials said
they hoped adult men with medical problems also would be allowed to
depart.
   Asked whether the Friday charter will be part of a daily exodus,
Dillen said, ``I don't want to speculate about the future beyond
this first flight.''
   VOA broadcasts to Kuwait are encouraging Americans there to stay
in touch with the American Embassy.
   ``We are hoping to start air evacuation within the next few days
from Kuwait through Baghdad to Amman,'' a text of the broadcast
says.
   There are an estimated 2,200 Americans in Kuwait and 300 in Iraq.
   Twelve Americans were aboard a Canadian-chartered flight
Thursday.
   Dillen's account of the incident involving the wounded American
was partially provided by an American eyewitness who later was
taken by Iraqi authorities from Kuwait to Baghdad.
   Iraqi officials in Baghdad confirmed the American was injured,
but said the injury was not serious, Dillen said.
   ``We hold the Iraqi government responsible for the health and
welfare of all American citizens held against their will in Kuwait
and Iraq,'' Dillen said.
   ``Reports that Iraqi soldiers are using live fire in their
efforts to round up foreigners are extremely disturbing, and yet
another indication of the lengths to which the Iraqis are willing
to go to carry out their inhumane policy of using innocent
foreigners as shields while denying them the right to leave.''
   The State Department lodged a protest with Iraqi Ambassador
Mohamed al-Mashat, who told reporters the American was violating
curfew.
   ``Soldiers are under orders to enforce the curfew,'' he said.
``To enforce the law, you (Americans) use firepower in the streets.
Now we are in an emergency situation.''

   Companies that say the United States should
adopt cheaper, interim technology before moving to a full
high-definition TV system got some bad news Thursday from the head
of the Federal Communications Commission.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, in his strongest statement yet on how
quickly the nation should shift to HDTV, told a broadcasters'
seminar that he saw little possibility the commission would decide
to allow so-called enhanced-definition TV to be used before full
HDTV.
   While not slamming the door completely on the interim EDTV,
which is being promoted by a consortium that includes NBC-TV, Sikes
said the commission's preliminary decision to try to adopt a
``simulcast'' HDTV system for the nation in early 1993 probably
would not be changed.
   ``I do think any objective review of the record will show that
the simulcast HDTV option we have pointed toward has greater public
interest'' than EDTV, Sikes said in prepared remarks for a meeting
of the Association of Maximum Service Television.
   He said HDTV ``affords broadcasters the ability to be fully
competitive in the future video services marketplace.''
   Sikes is among those concerned that Japanese or European
manufacturers not dominate the HDTV market, which most observers
believe will be a huge business in the next century.
   At Thursday's meeting, he rejected assertions that the FCC was
moving too quickly to adopt an HDTV standard, while citing Japan's
long lead in bringing HDTV to the public.
   NBC and the David Sarnoff Research Center, along with
electronics giants Thomson Consumer Electronics and Philips
Consumer Electronics, have proposed EDTV as a less-expensive means
of improving today's TV images.
   EDTV, while less sharp than HDTV, could be sent out by stations
on a single channel. But viewers would need a new set to receive
the improved EDTV image.
   Simulcast systems would send programs normally on one channel
and the same programs in HDTV on a separate channel. A new set also
would be required to receive the HDTV signal.
   The NBC consortium says EDTV would require relatively
inexpensive equipment changes at TV stations.
   Sikes said that adopting EDTV first would create unnecessary
costs for stations and viewers and could cause viewers to resist
buying EDTV sets if they knew that HDTV would soon make those sets
obsolete.
   The NBC consortium, hedging its bets, also is among a half-dozen
companies that will offer simulcast HDTV systems for testing by an
industry-sponsored laboratory that will recommend an HDTV standard
to the FCC. Testing is to begin this year or early next year.
   HDTV promises crystal-clear pictures and compact disc-quality
sound. Proponents see numerous medical, military and educational
uses for sharper TV images.

<HEAD>Bridge Barricaded in Mohawk Dispute Reopened After Two Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mercier Bridge linking Montreal to its
south-shore suburbs opened Thursday for the first time following an
eight-week standoff between armed Mohawks and police.
   As army pipers played, hundreds of cars and trucks drove onto
the bridge from suburban Chateauguay, through the Kahnawake Mohawk
reserve and past armored personnel carriers in the early morning
mist.
   Commuters had started lining up their cars an hour earlier,
horns honking impatiently as they waited for the army to wave them
through.
   ``It's about time,'' one man on his way to work at a Montreal
refrigerated warehouse told a radio station. ``The government
should never have let this happen in the first place.''
   The bridge normally handles about 70,000 vehicles during the
daily rush hour. It was barricaded by natives from the Kahnawake
reserve after provincial police staged an abortive attack on a
Mohawk barricade at Kahnesatake near Oka, Quebec, on July 11 in
which an officer died.
   The bridge closure led to violent demonstrations by south-shore
commuters, including an incident last week in which a white mob
hurled stones at a convoy of Mohawk women, children and invalids
escaping the reserve.
   The stage was set for the reopening when barricades at Kahnawake
came down last week after an agreement was reached between the army
and Mohawks.
   But in Kahnesatake _ where the Mohawk deadlock began over a land
dispute _ soldiers spent Wednesday firming up their positions
around the last Warrior stronghold.
   Federal Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon met with a delegation
of native leaders in Ottawa on Wednesday. But he stopped short of
committing the government to either of the two requests made by the
Indian delegation _ that the army retreat at least 100 yards away
from Mohawk lines, and that Ottawa assume an active role in the
negotiations.
   Among the native leaders who met with Siddon were George Erasmus
of the Assembly of First Nations, Canada's largest native group.
   Erasmus said the federal and Quebec governments must get
involved in a new round of negotiations to resolve the stalemate at
Kahnesatake, 18 miles west of Montreal.
   About 400 soldiers have backed some 20 warriors and 30 Mohawk
women and children into a piece of land about the size of two
football fields, bordered by a highway and a lake. On Wednesday the
soldiers surrounded the site with razor wire and set up a floating
barricade on the lake.
   The Mohawks say they won't lay down their arms until a policing
arrangement is worked out that would preclude the Quebec provincial
police from taking control once the crisis comes to an end. Natives
say they fear reprisals from the police for the death of one of
their officers in the botched raid in July.
   The deadlock at Oka began when provincial police stormed a
barricade the Mohawks erected to stop the town's plans to expand
the local golf course, saying the property in question was part of
their ancestral land.
   Elsewhere in Quebec, about 100 Micmac Indians blocked a stretch
of highway, just across the border from Cambellton, New Brunswick.
   The Indians felled trees and used rocks and abandoned cars to
set up two roadblocks. They said the barricades would remain until
the Oka crisis is resolved.

<HEAD>Post Says Foundation Ignored Discount in Purchasing Neuharth Book</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gannett Foundation purchased 2,000 copies
of the autobiography of its chairman, Allen H. Neuharth, raising
questions about whether it was trying to boost the book's standing
on national bestseller lists, The Washington Post said Thursday.
   Neuharth, in response, was quoted as saying he was on The Post's
``enemy list.''
   Neuharth said that Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee was out to
``get him'' and that ``playing a non-news story like this on page
one when the world is full of real news is typical of the personal
journalism The Post uses to try to get its enemies and help its
friends.''
   He was quoted in a statement by Foundation President and Chief
Executive Officer Charles L. Overby.
   The foundation said that it spent $40,000 to buy the copies of
``Confessions of an S.O.B.,'' that the books were donated to
college libraries and journalism schools, and that there was no
attempt to manipulate sales.
   Overby said in his statement that purchase of the books ``was
consistent with our mission of teaching young journalists and other
young people how to succeed in life.''
   Neuharth was chairman of Gannett Co., the nation's largest
newspaper group, until he retired 17 months ago to head the
foundation. He told The Post his autobiography sold 164,000 copies
in hardback between September 1989 and the end of last year. It was
on The New York Times bestseller list for several weeks.
   The Post, quoting Gannett editors and people connected to the
foundation, said the foundation's motives were suspect because it
bought the books at full retail prices in stores around the country.
   The foundation could have obtained the books at a sizable
discount from Neuharth's publisher, Doubleday Inc., but only retail
purchases count on bestseller lists compiled by The New York Times
and Publishers Weekly.
   The Post said Overby asked some of Gannett Co.'s 81 daily
newspapers to buy books at stores in their cities. The foundation
then reimbursed the editors for the cost of the books.
   Michael Kagay, editor of news surveys for The New York Times
Book Review, said the purchase of 2,000 copies normally would not
have much effect on how a book fares on the bestseller list.
   The Times does not reveal the names of the approximately 3,000
bookstores it surveys in compiling its list and ``if someone tried
to influence the list, most of their purchases would be wasted.
They wouldn't know which stores to go to,'' Kagay said.
   Overby, in his statement, said Neuharth, now traveling outside
Washington, ``laughed heartily when I read him'' The Post story.

<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo on
Thursday told North Korea's prime minister their nations must hold
a summit to set the stage for eventual unification of the divided
peninsula.
   ``Korea can't remain the last divided nation on Earth separated
by Cold War,'' Roh said at the first meeting between a South Korean
head of state and a North Korean leader.
   It came after two days of historic talks between the prime
ministers of the hostile nations.
   Roh's meeting at his office with the communist premier, Yon
Hyong Muk, was seen as indicating North Korea's tacit recognition
of rival South Korea.
   The nations, divided since 1945, have never officially
recognized each other. The North has ignored past summit proposals
and officials did not react publicly to the latest one.
   Although talks between Yon and his South Korean counterpart,
Kang Young-hoon, failed to produce any tangible agreements,
officials of both sides were upbeat and agreed to meet next month
in North Korea's capital.
   ``Unlike in the past, there was a realistic discussion,'' said
South Korean Unification Minister Hong Sung-chul. ``I think the
talks were successful and a step forward.''
   ``I'm optimistic there could be progress,'' said An Byong Su,
spokesman for North Korea.
   s.
   At Thursday's meeting of the prime ministers, North Korea
reiterated its demands that South Korea release jailed dissidents,
halt a joint U.S. military exercise and stop efforts to seek its
own seat in the United Nations, Seoul officials said.
   North Korea also demanded the withdrawal of the American troops
stationed in the South under a mutual defense treaty, they said.
   Lengthy proposals presented for easing military and political
tensions and setting up various exchanges will be discussed at
future talks, spokesmen for the two sides said.
   Red Cross authorities may soon open talks aimed at helping
reunite 10 million members of families separated by the division of
the peninsula and the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The premiers' meeting was the highest-level contact ever between
the Koreas. The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist
North and the capitalist South in 1945. The border is sealed and
there is no mail or other form of communication between the nations.
   The North Korean premier and his 89-member entourage were
scheduled to return home by way of the border village of Panmunjom
on Friday.

<TEXT>
   Minnesota and Wisconsin were drenched Thursday, leaving some
spots under 18 inches of water, and areas in the Midwest and South
baked in oppressive triple-digit heat and high humidity.
   Thunderstorms were active during the morning, and thunderstorm
winds caused damage near Constantine, Mich. Heavy rain from strong
thunderstorms flooded roads and basements across northeast
Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin.
   In Minnesota, 18 inches of water covered roads in Morgan Park
and several roads in southern St. Louis County were washed out.
Water was waist deep on streets in Carlton County and some highways
to Clouquet were closed.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon in
northern Ohio, southern Lower Michigan, northern Wisconsin and
southern Upper Michigan, as well as along the Texas Gulf Coast, the
Louisiana coast, and the Florida peninsula.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered in West Virginia,
western Virginia, west central Alabama, south central Kansas and
northwest Oklahoma, northeast Colorado and western Nebraska,
southeastern South Dakota, western Minnesota, northeast California
and Oregon.
   In Kansas, the heat index, combining the temperature with
humidity levels, was forecast at up to 105 degrees in central and
eastern parts of the state.
   Advisories for excessive heat were posted through Friday for
northeast and north-central Texas. The heat index was forecast from
105 to 112 degrees. Northwestern Louisiana had heat indexes ranging
from 105 to 112 degrees, too.
   The heat index was forecast in the range of 105 to 110 degrees
in central Indiana and 110 to 115 degrees in the southern part of
the state.
   High temperature records for Thursday were broken in Kansas
City, Mo., with 99 degrees, surpassing the previous 97-degree mark;
Meridian, Miss., with 102, besting the record 100; Pensacola, Fla.,
with 94, beating 93; and Tupelo, Miss., with 103, beating 101.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 was 38 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   In the eastern Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Isidore became
stronger with sustained winds near 70 mph and higher gusts. At
noon, the center of Isidore was 800 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands and moving northwest 15 mph.
   Isidore threatens no major area of land.

<HEAD>Kuwait Says Iraq is Plundering Hospitals, Blood Banks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq has plundered Kuwait's blood banks
and its hospitals, stripping the facilities of intensive care
equipment and incubators and causing the deaths of patients,
Kuwait's ambassador said Thursday.
   ``We do have some reports of the inhuman practices,'' Kuwaiti
Ambassador Mohammad Abulhasan told reporters. He said health
authorities in occupied Kuwait had provided him with reports of the
looting of medical equipment.
   In a letter to the Security Council, he said, ``The delicate
medical equipment used in the intensive care units of many Kuwaiti
hospitals has been seized and taken to Baghdad. This has led to the
death of many patients who were receiving intensive care.
   ``The incubators in maternity hospitals used for ... premature
children have been removed, causing the death of all the children
who were under treatment,'' his letter said.
   ``Plasma deposits at the blood bank have been removed and
transferred to Baghdad,'' he continued.
   ``The inmates of mental hospitals and centers for the disabled
have been released and allowed to roam in the streets without any
care or attention,'' the ambassador added.
   Last week, the ambassador said all five of Kuwait's regular
hospitals had been emptied of patients to be used by Iraqi troops
and citizens, causing the deaths of several elderly patients who
depended on life-support equipment.
   In remarks to reporters Thursday, Abulhasan said ``We have
reports also of looting of reservoirs of food for Kuwait and moving
it to Iraq. It has taken place since the first week of the
occupation'' that began Aug. 2.
   When asked if any deaths by starvation had occurred in Kuwait,
he replied, ``Not yet.''

   President Bush will accept Saddam Hussein's
offer to broadcast a message to Iraq, but only on his own terms,
Bush's spokesman said Thursday. The president will make a tape in
lieu of an interview with an Iraqi TV crew.
   ``It's a real opportunity,'' Bush said of Saddam's offer to
televise the U.S. leader's comments. Bush's spokesman said the
president had ``a very distinct message'' to give the Iraqi people
about American reasons for the massive military buildup in the
Persian Gulf.
   Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat said in Washington that ``of
course'' Iraqi TV would air Bush's message ``in its entirety
without editing. Here you edit, in Iraq we do not edit.''
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's address would be eight to
10 minutes long.
   ``We will have a whole package for broadcast on Iraqi
television, and then we'll have a State Department interpreter who
will provide the interpretation some way'' into Arabic, Fitzwater
said, adding that the tape will be released generally.
   On another topic, looking ahead to this weekend's superpower
summit, Bush said he will use the meeting not only to discuss the
Persian Gulf with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev but to
press for a quick resolution to strategic arms talks.
   Before embarking on a one-day political trip to Kansas and
Florida on Thursday, Bush spoke by telephone with a number of world
leaders on the gulf situation and his upcoming meeting with
Gorbachev. They included Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, Turkish
President Turgut Ozal, French President Francois Mitterrand and
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the White House said.
   He also called United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to thank him for his unsuccessful try at resolving the gulf
crisis in talks last week in Iraq.
   Bush also met Thursday with Israel's visiting foreign minister,
David Levy in Washington.
   Naji al-Hadithi, director general of Iraq's Information
Ministry, said in Baghdad that an Iraqi television crew was ready
to go to Washington to interview Bush for a broadcast on state-run
television.
   Fitzwater said that wouldn't be necessary _ ``we'll produce it
ourselves.''
   ``Although we have not heard from Iraq directly, we accept their
offer of a broadcast to the Iraqi people. The president will tape a
message to the Iraqi people in the next few days which will be
provided to the Iraqi information minister,'' Fitzwater told
reporters accompanying Bush on Air Force One.
   Bush has said he wished he could have the media access in Iraq
that Saddam has had on U.S. television. The Iraqi president's
statements and appearances have been broadcast widely, many of them
on live and unedited CNN reports.
   ``The president has a very distinct message that he wants to
give to the people of Iraq about our purpose for being in the gulf.
He thinks this is a good opportunity,'' Fitzwater said.
   On a separate matter, Fitzwater said that there is no new
economic package for the Soviet Union in the offing, although the
Sunday summit meeting in Helsinki will offer a chance to talk about
``technical assistance.''
   He had said on Wednesday that because of Soviet cooperation in
the United Nations-led sanctions against Iraq, Bush was willing to
look anew at potential financial aid for the ailing Soviet economy.
   Fitzwater noted Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher was leading
a team of American business executives to Moscow to discuss
investment opportunities. They will stop in Helsinki during the
summit.
   Fitzwater said Bush has not yet decided whether to attend the
Oct. 3 Berlin ceremony celebrating Germany's reunification.
   Speaking at a Kansas fund-raiser for Gov. Mike Hayden's
re-election bid, Bush said that while the Persian Gulf is expected
to consume much of the conversation at the summit, he also wants to
focus on arms control.
   ``I will continue to press for a prompt resolution of the START
treaty,'' he said of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks that
officials hope will produce agreement by the end of the year on
reducing nuclear weapons.
   Noting the international condemnation of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait and sanctions against Saddam, Bush said:
   ``We will remain united. In that spirit, I look forward to
Sunday's meeting with President Gorbachev in Helsinki.''
   He pointed to ``new levels of cooperation'' between the
superpowers, and said the Persian Gulf situation ``shows what this
cooperation can achieve.''
   ``This meeting can further expand cooperation between the U.S.
and Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Bush also reiterated the U.S. determination to ``do whatever it
takes to help our men and women restore peace'' in the Middle East.
   ``We will not stand by while one country devours another
unthreatening country,'' he said.
   Later, at a fund-raiser for Rep. Bill Grant, R-Fla., Bush
condemned Saddam Hussein anew.
   ``Our argument is not with the people of Iraq,'' Bush said.
``Rather, it is with Iraq's dictator who uses innocent travelers as
shields, who now ... holds hostages from many countries. But he
must know that our policy ... will not be altered by this brazen
blackmail.''
   Bush's trip Thursday marked his first flight on the new Air
Force One, a specially equipped Boeing 747 that replaced his aging
707.
   ``It's marvelous in every way _ the latest in technology and
certainly very, very comfortable,'' Bush said as he stepped aboard.
``It's so much roomier. My heavens. ... It is magnificent.''

<HEAD>Protesters Denounce `Red Terror' at Lenin Statue in Ukraine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30 nationalists gathered Thursday night at
the foot of a statue of Vladimir Lenin in a Ukrainian city for a
candlelight vigil to denounce 72 years of ``red terror,'' the Tass
news agency reported.
   The demonstrators in Donetsk placed a garland of barbed wire
around the base of the statue to the founder of the Soviet state,
Tass reported.
   A ribbon attached to the wire said ``To V.I. Lenin _ on the 72nd
Anniversary of Red Terror,'' the news agency said. Another streamer
reportedly bore the words: ``100 million victims.''
   Tass said the demonstrators, all members of a Ukrainian
nationalist movement, held lighted candles in the vigil, which
lasted about an hour.
   The Tass account was headlined ``Insulting Vigil at Lenin
Monument in Donetsk,'' and said passers-by expressed anger and
bewilderment at the protest.
   Police asked the demonstrators to disperse, and one of the
participants tried to slash his veins to protest what he called
illegal police actions, Tass reported. He received medical
assistance, and the demonstrators dispersed, the news agency added.
   Donetsk, the center of the eastern Ukraine's Don River coal
basin, was the site this summer of a one-day strike by miners
demanding less interference from the Communist Party. Miners in
Donetsk also joined a long, bitter coal strike in the summer of
1989 over low wages and consumer goods shortages.
   Statues of Lenin have been vandalized with increasing frequency
across the Soviet Union in recent months, and some have been
dismantled on the orders of local authorities, to the dismay of the
Soviet leadership.

<HEAD>Teacher, Students Walk to School in Display of Energy Conservation</HEAD>

   A high school teacher felt the Persian Gulf
crisis down to the soles of his feet Thursday when he dramatized
energy conservation by walking 11 miles to his classroom.
   Scores of students joined Don Chenoweth, voting with their feet
in favor of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
   ``The prices are going up,'' says Coleman Davis, a 14-year-old
freshman at Concord High School who walked several miles. ``So if
lots of people from our school walked, we'd save gas.''
   The idea grew from Chenoweth's senior government class, where
students began discussing methods of energy conservation in the
face of rising fuel prices.
   ``In the course of the conversation, I threw out the challenge:
If I walk to school one of these days, how many students would be
willing to do the same,'' he said while walking the final yards.
   ``If nothing else, they'll get a little firsthand involvement
with current events.''
   Chenoweth left his Mishawaka home at 3:45 a.m., walking with
school counselor Don Mann, and arrived shortly after 7 a.m., nearly
30 minutes ahead of schedule.
   Chenoweth, 57, doesn't offer himself as model of fitness or
restraint in driving. He says his exercising is usually limited to
an occasional evening stroll, and he's put 146,000 miles on his
1982 Pontiac.
   Many people have forgotten the conservation lessons enforced by
oil crises of the 1970s, he said, and for his students, those years
are dim history.
   ``I did tell them about the 1970s, how we were mandated by the
government to turn back the heat in public buildings, and
encouraged to do other things,'' he said.
   ``They were not aware that the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit
really came about in an attempt to save fuel, not an attempt to
slow us down to save lives.''
   About 300 students agreed to give up cars and school buses for
the day and walk, said Principal Robert Sutton, who walked the two
miles from his home.
   No one kept count of how many participated, but scores of
students appeared on foot in groups of three and four, already
looking tired and sweaty shortly after 7 a.m.
   ``Four miles _ we did it,'' said Lee Anne Grice. ``We are having
an energy crisis right now, so I thought it would be a good way to
show my support.''
   Sophomore Chris Carrel, 15, left his motor scooter, which gets
about 75 miles to the gallon, at home to prove his point.
   ``The Iraq thing kind of makes it worthwhile,'' he said. ``Saves
me some gasoline.''
   Chenoweth and Mann arrived sweaty but smiling, then showered and
changed for class.
   ``I may move closer if we try this again,'' said Mann.

   After being held a political hostage by a mutinous
lieutenant governor, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis departed on a European
trade mission Thursday as his allies moved to quash the rebellion.
   Dukakis had delayed his travel plans Tuesday after Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy threatened to seize control of Massachusetts' feeble
finances once he left.
   ``I think the episode of the past 24 hours is really kind of
pathetic,'' Dukakis said at a brief airport news conference before
boarding his plane to Germany.
   While Dukakis allies moved to quash the rebellion Thursday, with
references to a new form of ``Murphy's Law'' and an ``attempted
bloodless coup,'' Murphy said her boss was acting ``weird'' by not
letting her assert herself.
   ``There's no good will here and certainly no mutual respect,''
Murphy said.
   Dukakis said he did not speak to Murphy on Thursday, but he said
he believed her assurances that she would act responsibily in his
absence. But he said he could cut his trip short if anything occurs
that affected the government's stability.
   Murphy spokeswoman Jody D'Urso said the lieutenant governor, who
is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, would not take
any action Thursday night. D'Urso did not rule out Murphy acting
later.
   Murphy, who is lagging in her Democratic primary race to succeed
Dukakis, had been a strong supporter of the governor in his 1988
bid for the presidency. But with the state in a fiscal disaster and
Dukakis not seeking re-election, politicians have treated him as a
liability.
   Murphy took the anti-Dukakis revolt to a new level Wednesday
when she disclosed she was waiting for the governor to leave the
state so, as acting governor, she could push a secret plan for
solving the state's financial woes.
   Dukakis decided to postpone his travel plans, prompting some
observers to say he was being held hostage by his own lieutenant
governor.
   Dukakis bitterly denounced the tactic as a maneuver designed to
gain favor with voters in the gubernatorial race. On Thursday,
aides to Dukakis echoed that charge.
   ``Here's a lady who isn't going to get elected governor no
matter what she does, and she is dangerously flirting with the
economic health of the commonwealth of Massachusetts. That's
irresponsible,'' said L. Edward Lashman, state secretary of
Administration and Finance. Lashman said he isn't publicly
supporting any candidate in the Sept. 18 primary.
   According to recent public opinion polls, Murphy is well behind
her two Democratic opponents _ former state Attorney General
Francis X. Bellotti and John Silber, who is on leave as Boston
University's president. Before this week, she tried gently to
disassociate herself from Dukakis, claiming she warned him in the
spring of 1988 that the state was headed for trouble.
   Murphy insisted Thursday that she was simply looking out for the
well-being of the state, which discovered this week its tax
collections had fallen short for the second month in a row. That
prompted Dukakis to order cabinet members to find $150 million
worth of cuts.
   Murphy said quicker action was needed, but she refused to reveal
her strategy, even to Dukakis during a phone conversation.
   ``She's elevated Murphy's Law to an art form,'' said Stephen
Crawford, a Dukakis spokesman. ``Whatever can go wrong, she'll make
sure goes wrong.''
   In her defense, Murphy told a radio station Thursday: ``I can't
understand why he's so concerned and what this strange behavior is
about. ... Frankly, I find the governor's response yesterday
weird.''
   Murphy's actions, however, caused some defections within her
ranks. William Currier, a campaign coordinator, resigned because of
her moves against Dukakis.
   ``It's almost an attempted bloodless coup,'' he said. If Murphy
tries to make changes as acting governor, he said, cabinet
secretaries might either disregard her, or Dukakis could reverse
the action once he returned.
   Currier also questioned how Murphy could ``solve problems in 10
days that hundreds of people couldn't solve in two years.''
   The state's fiscal mess has given Massachusetts the lowest bond
ratings of any state.
   Lashman said Thursday that Wall Street had started to send
positive signals since the state adopted a tax and budget package
and Dukakis ordered new cuts once it became apparent they were
necessary. He said Murphy's actions could undo efforts to rebuild
the state's image.

<HEAD>The Brezhnev Suite: Available for $525 a Night</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hotel suite used by former Soviet leader Leonid
I. Brezhnev will be rented out to foreign tourists for $525 a night
by an American entrepreneur, Tass reported Thursday.
   The businessman, Kristianu Tomesku, plans to turn vacation
cottages and hotel suites once used by the Communist Party elite
into luxury accommodations for foreign tourists in the southern
Soviet republic of Moldavia, Tass said.
   Tomesku will open a network of casinos, restaurants, bars,
swimming pools and tennis courts in the Kholerkan and Kodru hotel
and cottage complex in the Moldavian capital of Kishinev and its
suburbs, the Soviet news agency reported.
   The digs, which Tass described as ``comfortable,'' previously
were used as recreation sites by members of the republic's
government and high-ranking Communist Party officials.
   A room at one of the hotels will cost $80 a night, the report
said, while the ``Blue Suite,'' which was used by high-ranking
officials, will go for about $350 nightly.
   ``Those foreigners who like exotics and wish to stay in the
luxurious suite in which Leonid Brezhnev was accommodated some time
ago will pay $525 a day for it,'' the Tass report said.
   Tass gave no further details on the luxury suites, the
background of Tomesku, or how he obtained the property _ except to
say he is leasing it.
   Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 until his death in
November 1982.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Brezhnev has been blamed for
fostering complacency and cronyism during his years in power, which
Soviet officials call the ``period of stagnation.''
   The press has published other details of his lavish lifestyle,
including a white marble mansion in Azerbaijan built for Brezhnev
so he could stay there during a 1982 visit. He stayed there two
days.

<HEAD>Legislators Demand Control Over EGerman Secret Police Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers criticized a treaty laying the
foundation for German unity Thursday because it fails to give East
Germans control over the secret files of the former Communist
regime.
   The treaty that reconciles many of the differences between the
two German states came up for a first reading in Parliament.
   Several legislators were irate over the vagueness of the
provision dealing with the files kept by the former secret police.
   A group of activists who helped lead the revolution that toppled
the Communists have been occupying the former state police
headquarters where the files are kept.
   They began a sit-down protest on Tuesday and are demanding that
East Germans have access to the files and that secret police still
working in the government be fired.
   Even Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said the provision in the
treaty, which he personally approved, should be modified to deal
more specifically with the fate of the files.
   Later, his top unity negotiator, Guenter Krause, said on West
German radio that East Germans should be allowed to know what is in
their files.
   The files are an emotional issue in a nation that was largely
kept in check by the smothering and frequently sinister activities
of the giant secret police network.
   The activists and many lawmakers are demanding that East Germans
have the right to read the files that were kept on them. Records
were kept on an estimated 6 million of the 16 million Germans.
   The treaty between the German states says the files will
temporarily remain on East German land but will be administered by
a West German official until a united German parliament, to be
elected on Dec. 2, makes a final decision on their future.
   However, activists and many lawmakers said the agreement was
tantamount to giving the files to West Germany because the united
parliament will be dominated by lawmakers from the larger country.
   Some lawmakers demanded the rejection of the 900-page state
treaty that aims to reconcile many of the social and political
differences between the two nations, which are to merge on Oct. 3.
   Lawmakers are expected to hold a final vote on the treaty next
week.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An editor at the Washington Afro-American
resigned Thursday after saying the minority-owned weekly newspaper
refused to profile a mayoral candidate because he is white.
   Robyn Denise Yourse, who is black, said Thursday she submitted
her resignation to publisher Frances Murphy after Murphy refused to
include a story on City Council Chairman David Clarke in a 36-page
issue of the paper.
   ``I felt that the reasons given for yanking the profile were
racially biased,'' said Yourse. ``It was a decision in all good
conscience I could not agree with.''
   Yourse declined to elaborate on her discussion with the
publisher, who also is black.
   ``Her reasoning was clear to me, and I will say it had nothing
to do with the candidate's views,'' Yourse said. ``Beyond that, I
do not wish to embellish.''
   Murphy denied that Clarke was excluded because of his race,
claiming that other candidates who did not receive the paper's
endorsement were not given full-length feature articles.
   ``We're just a weekly, and we don't have the space,'' Murphy
said. ``There were lots of people who didn't (get articles), so you
can't say it is black and white.''
   She added that she was uncertain whether the paper had prepared
an article on the council chairman.
   ``There are some we did, and some we did not do,'' Murphy said.
``I just don't know.''
   But an Afro-American staffer, who asked not to be identified by
name, said Clarke had been the subject of a feature story.
   ``They had it ready,'' the staffer told The Associated Press.
``He came up there, he was interviewed, and a story was prepared.''
   Clarke is the only white vying for the city's Democratic mayoral
nomination. His four opponents are black.
   Clarke, a Washington native and veteran of the civil rights
movement, has been ranked third or fourth in recent public opinion
polls.
   The Afro, which endorsed Ray for mayor in Thursday's edition,
has long been a source of news and influence in Washington's black
community. The newspaper lists its circulation at 10,000, which
would make it the most widely-read of six minority-published
weeklies in the nation's capital.
   In recent weeks, the paper has published profiles of candidates
John Ray, Charlene Drew-Jarvis, Sharon Pratt-Dixon and Walter
Fauntroy.

   As hundreds of foreigners trapped in Iraq
and Kuwait struggled to get out, Iraq on Thursday imposed a law
mandating possible life imprisonment for those caught trying to
leave without permission.
   A plane with 136 Canadians, 12 Americans and 10 Irish who had
been in Kuwait and Iraq arrived in London late Thursday on a
Nationair flight chartered by Canada's government, airport
authorities reported. All but 24 of the passengers were flying on
to Toronto after a brief refueling stop, they said.
   A British Airways charter with 250 women and children on board
departed early Friday from Amman for London. They arrived Thursday
in Jordan on two Iraqi Airways jets, one carrying 150 passengers
and the second 100, said British Ambassador to Jordan, Anthony Reed.
   Iraq's justice minister, Akram Abdul-Kader, ordered public
prosecutors and police to revive a 1987 law that ``a foreigner
violating the entry and exit procedures ... will be sentenced to
life or temporary imprisonment, and all cash in his possession will
be confiscated.''
   In an interview with the official Iraqi News Agency, monitored
in Nicosia, he said: ``Courts and prosecutors are called upon to
make no exception in implementing this law in light of the present
circumstances.''
   The minister added that foreigners must report any change in
address within 48 hours or face prison terms of one to three years,
plus fines of $300 to $1,500.
   Hundreds of Westerners in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait are in hiding to
avoid being captured by Iraqi troops. Some foreigners keep
constantly on the move, often avoiding Iraqi soldiers with the help
of Kuwaiti friends.
   Abdul-Kader repeated an order given Aug. 24 that anyone caught
harboring a foreigner would face charges of espionage, punishable
by death.
   Earlier, a British convoy carrying 182 women and children
arrived in the Iraqi capital from Kuwait. The Iraqi president,
Saddam Hussein, has said women and children may leave but men must
stay.
   The latest arrivals were put in a hotel, where presumably they
will await official permission to leave the country. Some men were
believed to be among the group.
   The convoy left Kuwait on Thursday at 9:15 a.m. for the 14-hour
drive across the desert to Baghdad, British diplomats in Iraq said.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about 60
women and children were in the group, including 50 Britons, nine
Americans and one West German. U.S. Embassy officials were trying
to arrange travel for the group to the Jordanian capital of Amman
aboard an Iraqi Airways flight.
   Another 306 foreigners arrived in Baghdad on Tuesday in a convoy
from Kuwait.
   Four Irish women and children made it to Amman on Thursday on an
Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad.
   An Air France jet landed in Paris about dawn Thursday carrying
153 Westerners, including three pregnant women, who had traveled
from Baghdad overnight. There were at least nine Americans on board.
   A Western source in Baghdad said the United States was trying to
persuade Iraq to allow an Iraqi Airways jet to airlift some
Americans directly out of Kuwait without the overland trip to
Baghdad. An estimated 1,300 Americans remain in Kuwait, which has
been occupied by Iraqi soldiers since Aug. 2.
   There are believed to be a total of 11,000 Westerners trapped in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Joanna Restall of Brighton, England, is one of the Westerners
who have managed to get out of the region in relatively small
batches the past week. She arrived in London early Thursday from
Baghdad. Ms. Restall was part of a convoy Saturday that made a
hair-raising drive across the desert from Kuwait City.
   Ms. Restall, 29, who had been teaching English in Kuwait, said
the people left behind in Kuwait are frightened, particularly the
men.
   ``They can't go out, the shops are closed, there are lots of
wrecked cars everywhere _ it's like a ghost town,'' she said.
   The Iraqis have moved some Westerners to strategic facilities,
such as military bases, to deter possible attacks by Western forces.

   The Bush administration will enter
negotiations with the European Space Agency to set guidelines for
multinational commercial space ventures, the White House said
Thursday.
   The guidelines would cover undertakings with countries without
market economies like the Soviet Union and China.
   The negotiations are intended to develop ``principles of free
and fair trade,'' the White House said, so that U.S.
space-launching firms can compete in an international market free
of what they contend is unfair foreign government support.
   The White House said Bush has approved a new National Space
Policy Directive designed to ``encourage the growth of U.S. private
sector space activities'' and calling for the talks.
   The new policy was influenced by the end of Cold War tensions
with the Soviet Union and the administration's view that some
restrictions, formerly imposed under national security guidelines,
can be eased, said an administration official.
   Another source close to Bush's National Space Council, which
developed the policy, said the easing of restrictions is another
sign the Cold War is over.
   The sources spoke on condition that their names not be used.
   The new policy requires that national security restrictions on
technology transfers still must be taken into account with any
commercial launching venture with foreign countries.
   The guidelines are meant to replace the ad hoc approval
practices that governed past decisions on space launch firms, such
as Bush's recent authorization for a U.S. firm to participate in a
launching project in Cape York, Australia.
   That firm, USBI Co. of Hunstville, Ala., eventually hopes to
launch American-made satellites on Soviet rockets from the Cape
York.
   USBI would provide program management, engineering and
development for the launching facility and the Soviet Union would
provide the boosters. The United States government is not involved
in the project.
   The new policy's major contribution to such future ventures is
predictability, said Courtney Stadd, senior director of commercial
space for the National Space Council, which is headed with Vice
President Dan Quayle..
   ``We're trying to work out the principles of free market play,''
he said comparing it to the early days of aviation when there were
no rules governing international flights.
   It requires that U.S. government satellites be launched only on
U.S.-manufactured rockets.
   It also opens the possibility of government incentives ``to
encourage technical improvements to reduce the cost and increase
the reliability of U.S. space launch vehicles,'' according to a
White House fact sheet.
   The administration will begin negotiations with the European
Space agency sometime later this month on an agreement that
``defines principles of free and fair trade,'' it said.
   U.S. rocket launching firms have complained that European space
firms have unfair advantages due to government asistance.

   NASA said Thursday it will replace
the fuel pump that likely caused its latest failure to get
astronauts back in space and try again in mid-September to launch
Columbia.
   NASA Administrator Richard Truly said a new pump will be
installed this weekend. If that seems to correct the problem, a
fourth launch attempt will be made to launch the shuttle with an
astronomical observatory early the week of Sept. 17.
   ``It's not a 100 percent guarantee. But it's the one shot we
have to get the Astro mission airborne'' before Discovery's
scheduled flight with the Ulysses satellite in October, Truly said.
   The unit is bolted in and can be replaced easily, said launch
director Bob Sieck. Crews cannot enter the compartment until Friday
because propellants remain aboard, preventing a new pump from being
installed until Saturday.
   On Wednesday, NASA called off its third attempt to send Columbia
on a mission to study some of the hottest objects in the universe
with the $150 million Astro observatory. Thursday's early morning
launch was scrubbed after hydrogen flooded into the rear
compartment.
   Officials continued filling Columbia's massive external tank to
pinpoint the source and narrowed their search to the shuttle's
three recirculation pumps.
   Each of the shuttle's three main engines has a pump. Officials
were uncertain which one might be leaking or whether there were
other holes.
   The pumps are part of the plumbing in the rear of the shuttle,
where pipes range in diameter up to 17 inches. They are directly in
front of the huge engines and are accessible through side doors.
   ``We're not talking about a large leak. We're talking about an
extremely small leak,'' said Forrest S. McCartney, director of
Kennedy Space Center. ``It's very elusive and very frustrating.''
   ``It is a real booger to try to find and isolate,'' shuttle boss
Robert Crippen said.
   If a new pump does not correct Columbia's leaks or the launch is
delayed too long, the mission will wait until after Discovery's
flight with Ulysses, a satellite being sent on a five-year journey
to explore the sun's polar regions. Discovery must lift off between
Oct. 5 to Oct. 23 to take advantage of the proper planet alignment.
   ``Ulysses is our first priority and we will not compromise
that,'' said William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program.
   Columbia's seven astronauts left for their training base in
Houston at dawn.
   The mood at the space center was one of disappointment mixed
with relief.
   ``My first reaction was frustration,'' said program scientist Ed
Weiler. ``But my next thought was, `My God, I'm glad they stopped,
some of my friends are aboard.' '' Hydrogen is highly combustible.
   NASA had to replace a pump once before _ on Atlantis last year.
It delayed the launch with the Magellan space probe for six days.
   In May, NASA's first attempt to launch Columbia for the Astro
mission ground to a halt at almost the same moment during fueling
as more than a half-million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen were flowing into the tank Wednesday. The earlier attempt,
too, was delayed by leaks _ in two places.
   The space agency returned Columbia to the hangar, replaced a bad
valve and plugged leaks. The lines were tested with helium at room
temperature rather than with liquid hydrogen, a highly combustible
fuel that contracts metal because of its extreme cold.
   The repairs gave NASA the confidence to proceed with another
launch attempt, said David Winterhalter, director of systems
engineering and analysis for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. The second try, last week, was called off because
of communications problems with one of Astro's four telescopes.
   Columbia's long flight with Astro and its astronauts, four of
them astronomers, was to have revitalized NASA's stalled shuttle
program. The last shuttle flight was in April, when Discovery
carried the defective Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
   A month after first discovering Columbia was leaking, the
shuttle Atlantis was found to have a similar problem and the entire
fleet was grounded.
   John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George
Washington University, said he is confident NASA will fix the leak
and that shuttles soon will be flying again.
   ``We've launched 35 of these things. It's not like the system
can't work. We know it can work,'' Logsdon said. ``This is the kind
of vexing problem that will pop up along the way.''

<TEXT>
   Hard-line Communists from across the Soviet Union
headed back home Thursday after spending three days lamenting
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and arguing that socialism
has a bright future.
   Traditionalists far outnumbered reformers among the 2,585
delegates to the Communist Party Congress of the Russian Republic,
the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
   They applauded fiercely Thursday when a little-known Leningrad
delegate, Mikhail Popov, said Gorbachev's perestroika reform
program was ``not a revolution but a counterrevolution.'' They
clapped even louder when Popov warned that efforts to create a
market-based economy would help black marketeers.
   Gorbachev sat silently on the podium during Popov's speech and
most of the three-day session in the Kremlin's cavernous marble
Palace of Congresses. He finally addressed the congress Thursday
afternoon, just before it ended, but his speech was closed to both
Soviet and foreign reporters.
   Reformers who dared to speak in the open sessions were jeered
and heard deliberately disruptive applause, which the official
Soviet press agency Tass described as ``bad-tempered clashes.''
   One young delegate, Vladimir C. Zaitsev of Murmansk, incurred
the wrath of the hard-liners by suggesting their leader, Russian
Communist Party First Secretary Ivan K. Polozkov, did not have the
confidence of the people.
   Zaitsev's 10-minute speech was interrupted so many times he grew
red-faced and was barely able to continue.
   On Tuesday, a traditionalist from the Siberian city of Tyumen,
Ivan Vtorushin, suggested the country would be better off if it
returned to the way things were in 1985, the year Gorbachev came to
power.
   The purpose of the congress was primarily organizational: to
complete the creation of a separate Russian branch of the Communist
Party. Until this year, Russian Communists were simply members of
the Soviet Party and did not have their own organization.
   The Russian Party was founded at a first congress in the Kremlin
in June, when Polozkov was elected its leader. That congress was
widely seen in the Soviet Union as an attempt by traditionalists to
reassert themselves after being eclipsed for several years.
   Since June, several reformers have quit the Russian Party.
Others, such as economist Pavel Bunich, have publicly condemned the
Russian Party as ``rightist'' and called for Polozkov to resign.
   Polozkov, 55, has accused the pro-reform Soviet media of
conducting a campaign against him and discrediting traditional
socialist values. He said Thursday he would not step down.
   Despite their high profile during the congress, the influence of
the hard-liners appears limited. They do not have the authority to
make laws, and the party has lost both its official leading role in
society and much of its unofficial grip on Soviet life.

   An undisclosed number of American citizens are expected to leave

be regular evacuation flights arranged by the U.S. embassy. In
addition to women and children, U.S. officials said they hoped
adult men with medical problems would be allowed to depart.

   An American trying to evade capture was shot and wounded by an
Iraqi soldier in Kuwait, the State Department said.
   Iraqi officials say the unidentified man, who was wounded in the
forearm while trying to escape out a window of his Kuwait
apartment, ``will be discharged from the hospital within 24 hours,
but will remain in their custody,'' said agency spokesman Mark
Dillen.

   Meanwhile some 45,000 desperate Bangladeshis, Indians, Sri

   Three congressional employees were arrested on
Thursday and charged with narcotics distribution out of a House of
Representatives parking garage, U.S. Capitol Police said.
   Six people have been arrested since June for selling drugs in
the Capitol complex, which includes the Capitol Building and the
House and Senate office buildings, police said.
   John Robine Mickens, 27, of Landover, Md., and Charles Anthony
Vinson, 24, of Fort Washington, Md., were arrested Thursday and
charged with distribution of crack cocaine. William Robert
Woodburn, 33, of Leonardtown, Md., was arrested later and charged
with distribution of cocaine.
   Woodburn is employed by the Architect of the Capitol as a labor
leader, and Mickens and Vinson are employed by the Architect of the
Capitol as garage attendants.
   ``I think its shocking and indeed hypocritical to allow the
American people to believe that we have a handle on this very
serious national security problem,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
Chairman of the Select Committee of Narcotics.
   A three-month undercover investigation gave officials their
first arrest earlier this summer when a man sold drugs to an
undercover agent on June 13, officials said.

<HEAD>International Center Set Up to Help Polluted Eastern Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian President Arpad Goencz
planted a tree Thursday to mark the opening of an international
environmental center to help Eastern Europe cope with its
widespread pollution problems.
   Proposed by President Bush when he visited Hungary in July, the
Regional Environmental Center is an independent organization for
training and information on energy efficency, public health and
regional cooperation on pressing environmental problems.
   It is designed to provide data on environmental issues, but not
to get involved in political decisions in Eastern European
countries, said Lee Pasarew, director of its project development
team. Peter Hardi is the executive director.
   ``The opening of this center today is only the latest in a
remarkable series of events that history will record as the
revolution of 1989,'' William K. Reilly, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said in an opening speech.
   Eastern European countries are struggling with the results of a
chronic disregard for the environment that characterized the
Communist regimes overthrown last year.
   Antiquated factories central to their economies still spew tons
of waste into the air and water. Many forests are damaged, if not
decimated, by acid rain.
   Reilly said Wednesday that the center was a ``way of providing
legitimacy, involvement'' for Eastern European environmentalists
who had been previously suppressed.
   Half of the $10 million needed to start the center was donated
by the United States. The European Community gave $2.5 million;
Hungary $800,000; and the Netherlands, Austria and Canada $1.5
million total. Finland and Norway made smaller contributions.
   Any country may join the center by contributing money, but only
Eastern European countries may join free of charge.

   comment by Mandela on police investigations, details of talks loyal
to the African
National Congress.
   The clashes have claimed more than 550 lives since Aug. 12.
   Also Thursday, the ANC and government officials met in Pretoria
to discuss a no-violence pact, the status of ANC guerrillas and
other issues. A radio station reported the groups would meet again
Tuesday. No statements were issued after the meeting.
   The ANC formally suspended its 29-year guerrilla campaign Aug.
6. That improved prospects for negotiations on a new constitution
to give blacks a voice in national affairs.
   But ANC leader Nelson Mandela and other groups have pressed for
an independent probe into army involvement in the deaths of 11
people this week in Sebokeng. Mandela said Thursday investigations
begun by the government would be a ``whitewash.''
   Black leaders, including the South African Council of Churches
and an Anglican group led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have accused
soldiers of opening fire unneccesarily.
   Some black leaders have accused police of fueling the violence
by siding with Inkatha. Police and the government deny the
accusation.
   The Star newspaper reported Thursday that masked white men
joined a group of blacks in attacking a Sebokeng migrant workers'
hostel before dawn Tuesday. It said the attack killed 19 people and
caused a crowd of township residents to gather at the hostel.
Soldiers later opened fire.
   In March, police fired on protesters in Sebokeng, killing five
and wounding 150. A special judicial review panel concluded the
gunfire was unjustified.
   President F.W. de Klerk said Thursday the continuing unrest
could hinder negotiations on black-white power sharing but that
talks would continue.
   ``There can be no real reform before stability,'' the president
said.
   The white-led government and the ANC, the main black opposition
group, have been holding periodic talks since May.
   They met for 2{ hours on Thursday at police headquarters in
Pretoria for talks that were expected to focus partly on the
township fighting. No statements were issued after the meeting.
News reports said the groups would meet again next week.
   Law and Order Minister Minister Adriaan Vlok led the government
delegation. The ANC group was headed by Jacob Zuma, a member of its
policy-making National Executive Committee. Only three of the seven
ANC members appointed to meet with the government showed up.
   The man named to lead the ANC group, Chris Hani, was not present.
   He has been in the nominally independent Transkei homeland since
the government dropped him from a list of ANC leaders granted
temporary amnesty to participate in peace talks. Hani, leader of
the ANC's armed wing, has said the ANC would seize power if talks
with the government break down.
   De Klerk says he wants to end the apartheid system of racial
segregation and negotiate a constitution with opposition groups.
But he opposes black majority rule and a one-man, one-vote system.
   In Stockholm, Sweden, meanwhile, the fourth International
Conference Against Apartheid in Sport ended Thursday with delegates
urging a tightening of boycotts against South African athletes.
   Despite recent political changes in South Africa, the conference
said relaxing the boycotts ``would seriously prejudice'' progress
toward ending apartheid.
   Sports officials from South Africa and black African nations are
scheduled to hold formal talks for the first time in Harare,
Zimbabwe, Nov. 3-4. Officials from the International Olympic
Committee will attend.

<TEXT>
   An admitted murderer wouldn't watch a
courtroom showing of a videotape that shows her firing four shots
into her victim. Her ex-boyfriend testified Thursday she later
bragged about the killing.
   The videotape was shown during a sentencing hearing for Deidre
Hunt, 21. She has admitted shooting 19-year-old Mark Kevin Ramsey
last Oct. 20 in woods west of Daytona Beach as part of a tangled
murder-for-hire plot.
   Her former boyfriend, Newman Taylor, said she told friends she
was trying to become a paid assassin and part of Kosta Fotopoulos'
``Hunter-Killer Club.''
   ``She said `Do you know what it feels like to grab someone by
the hair and blow their brains out? It feels good,' '' Taylor, 21,
testified.
   Assistant State Attorney David Damore said Fotopoulos, 31, was
trying to arrange the death of his wife, Lisa, in hopes of
inheriting her money. He made the tape to ensure Miss Hunt's
cooperation in finding a killer and to eliminate the youth as a
possible witness in other illegal activities the men were involved
in, Damore said.
   Prosecutors say she and Fotopoulos tied Ramsey to a tree and
shot him. Miss Hunt said Ramsey's murder was videotaped by
Fotopoulos.
   The state also says other witnesses told them Hunt bragged about
the killing and showed off sneakers stained with Ramsey's blood.
   The videotape was viewed by a courtroom of spectators Wednesday.
Miss Hunt turned away and plugged her ears with her fingers as the
tape was shown.
   The videotape shows her pulling a silencer-equipped .22-caliber
pistol from her waistband and checking it. She raises her arm and
fires three times rapidly.
   Ramsey grunts as the first bullet hits him, then grunts again
and raises his left leg in agony. He slumps forward, groans ``God.''
   Miss Hunt then lifts Ramsey's head by the hair, places the gun
against his temple and fires again. Ramsey collapses to the ground.
   The state was seeking the death penalty in the hearing before
Circuit Judge S. James Foxman. The defense argued for the only
alternative, a life sentence with no possible parole for 25 years.
   Miss Hunt also has pleaded guilty to the Nov. 4 killing of Brian
Chase, 18. As part of the murder plot, he was to break into the
Fotopoulos home and shoot Mrs. Fotopoulos as she slept.
   He did, but was then shot to death by Fotopoulos, who called
police to report that he had killed an intruder who shot his wife,
authorities said.
   Mrs. Fotopoulos survived and later filed for divorce.
   Fotopoulos faces trial on two murder counts for the deaths of
Ramsey and Chase.
   During opening statements at the sentencing hearing, the defense
said Miss Hunt was abused as a child, is an emotional cripple and
can't appreciate the enormity of her actions.

   Farmers angered by falling meat prices seized a
truck Thursday carrying 386 British sheep, slaughtered the animals
and left their carcasses outside a government building, officials
said.
   It was one of the worst in a series of attacks in recent months
by French cattle and sheep farmers who complain they cannot earn
enough income because of foreign competition.
   The truck, which originated in Scotland, was intercepted early
Thursday near Limoges, central France. The farmers killed the sheep
at a slaughterhouse before dumping the carcasses in the streets and
garden outside a local government office in Bellac.
   Security forces confronted some farmers, reportedly firing tear
gas after being pelted with stones and eggs. No injuries or arrests
were reported.
   During the night, about 100 farmers staged a protest in
Chateau-Chinon, a central town where President Francois Mitterrand
once served as mayor. They set bales of hay on fire and sprayed
liquid manure at riot officers, police said.
   Farmers from southwestern France set loose 200 sheep Thursday in
the streets of Nyons to protest falling prices, police said. The
sheep had been stolen during the night from a truck.
   On Wednesday, farmers burned a truckload of meat near the
Belgian border and forced two trucks in Normandy to stop until a
veterinary inspection was conducted,
   British agriculture officials have complained about the lack of
arrests of farmers involved in attacks on British meat trucks.
   France's agriculture minister, Henri Nallet, issued a communique
Wednesday warning that offenders faced prosecutions.

<HEAD>Union Says 10 NBC Layoffs Due to New Contract, Plans Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union at NBC said 10 of its members were laid
off because of a new contract NBC put into effect last month, so
now it plans a boycott against NBC and sponsors of the network's
shows.
   NBC denied the accusations of the National Association of
Broadcast Employees and Technicians and characterized the
threatened boycott as an effort to harass the network.
   The skirmish was the latest since NBC's Aug. 15 implementation
of a new four-year contract that the union's members rejected
twice. They struck NBC in 1987 in a bitter walkout lasting 17 weeks.
   No strike is imminent this time because the union says it has
decided to employ what it calls ``the inside game'' _ keep its
members on the job as its lawyers fight NBC's action in various
ways.
   The 10 union members being laid off work at NBC-owned WMAQ-TV in
Chicago include Mike Cunningham, a member of the union's
negotiating committee and secretary of the union's local there,
NABET spokesman John Krieger said.
   Kreiger, whose union says it represents more than 2,300 people
in NBC's 5,800-member work force, attributed the layoffs to NBC's
new contract.
   NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge said the 10 layoffs had been planned
for late last year and early this year, but were delayed ``to
assist with vacation relief needs during the summer.''
   The layoffs ``have absolutely nothing to do with the new
contract,'' he said. Asked if more layoffs are planned, he replied:
``Not to my knowledge.''
   Krieger made public an Aug. 28 letter from NABET to Lane
Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO. The letter said a boycott
against NBC is part of the union's strategy to fight the contract
that the network put into effect.
   In addition to NBC, the boycott will be against the company's
owner, General Electric, and sponsors who advertise on NBC-owned
television stations and NBC's more than 200 affiliated stations,
Krieger said.
   No date has been set, but the boycott ``will happen very
shortly,'' he said.
   Rutledge responded that a boycott ``would certainly qualify as
harassment. It's regrettable. . . . A boycott serves no one's
interest and will gain NABET members absolutely nothing.''
   Until the union ratifies the contract that NBC has put into
effect, he added, members won't be eligible for the pay raises it
provides.

<HEAD>Oil Industry Forms $800 Million Corporation To Respond To Spills</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT spelling of Port Hueneme.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new corporation backed by the oil industry
will spend $800 million over the next five years on a nationwide
system designed to clean up the worst oil spills, its president
announced Thursday.
   The cost is three times the original estimate of a petroleum
industry task force which set up the Marine Spill Response Corp.
   Corporation President John D. Costello said the increases were
necessary to do the job.
   The company plans to construct five regional centers in areas
where major oil spills are most likely to occur: the New York-New
Jersey area; Port Everglades, Fla., north of Miami; Lake Charles,
La., near the Texas border; Port Hueneme, Calif., north of Los
Angeles, and Seattle, Wash.
   The worst spill in U.S. history occurred in Alaska on March 24,
1989. But Costello told a news conference the vastly improved spill
response capability in Alaska is now greater than it will be at any
of the corporation's regional centers. However, he said Marine
Spill Response is negotiating to work out what role it might play
in Alaska.
   The corporation is funded by dues from companies in the oil
industry, including owners, shippers and purchasers of crude oil
and petroleum products who have formed the Marine Preservation
Association. Each pays according to the number of barrels handled.
   But if a company spills oil, it will have to pay for the
cleanup, even if it is a dues-paying member of the association,
Costello said.
   In addition to the regional centers, Marine Spill Response will
have vessels at about nine other sites, ready for any spill along
coastal areas of the Atlantic, Pacific or Gulf of Mexico or around
Hawaii, the Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico, said Costello, a retired
Coast Guard vice admiral.
   ``We're excited by the prospect of creating the world's largest,
best-equipped and best-trained oil spill cleanup organization,'' he
said.
   Each regional center will have the ability to handle a spill
roughly as large as the record 11-million-gallon spill of crude oil
from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound, he said.
Regional centers can combine forces to handle even larger spills.
   The corporation expects to spend $315 million on initial
equipment, including ships, trucks, booms, skimmers, dispersants
and tools for dealing with wildlife and damaged shorelines.
   The company, with about 400 employees, will administer spill
response but will contract most of the work out to scores of other
companies, Costello said.
   He said it would supplement existing private and government
cleanup operations.
   ``We don't want to replace anybody who's there, absolutely not.
They're doing a fine job,'' he said.
   The company was set up to fulfill the terms of federal oil spill
legislation signed by President Bush last month. The bill gives oil
companies until February 1993 to show they can contain and clean up
a worst-case oil spill.
   Costello said the new company would be fully operational by then
and could provide some limited response even earlier.
   The oil spill law also increased the liability of shippers from
a ceiling of $150 per gross ton of the tanker to $1,200 per gross
ton.
   Costello said liability laws in some states should be changed to
allow for a quick response to oil spills. He said that although his
company would have no problem, because it is a non-profit
corporation, its subcontractors might be inhibited.
   The company grew out of an American Petroleum Institute task
force on oil spills which determined in June 1989 that neither the
government nor the oil industry had the equipment or personnel
ready to deal with a catastrophic spill.
   The new corporation will have its headquarters in Washington,
but will be independent from the petroleum institute, with a board
of directors made up of people outside the industry.

<HEAD>Plan To Deny Federal Benefits to Drug Convicts Draws Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSS SNEYD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government intends to test a
new weapong in the fight against crime _ denying student loans,
federally backed mortgages and other federal benefits to convicted
drug users in Rhode Island.
   Gov. Edward D. DePrete hailed the plan Thursday as a sensible
approach to the drug problem, but civil libertarians complained
that it would be unfair. The head of a national prosecutors' group
said violators would be losing only ``yuppie-type benefits.''
   DiPrete announced that Rhode Island had been awarded a $150,000
Justice Department grant to set up a system for tracking drug
convicts.
   A never-used, two-year-old federal law allows state and federal
judges to bar drug convicts from receiving federal contracts and
benefits that include farm subsidies and pilots' licenses.
   ``It's breaking new ground,'' DiPrete said at a Statehouse news
conference. ``We feel the federal law makes sense. It's one tool in
the arsenal and it's worth a try.''
   But the American Civil Liberties Union, which fought the
proposal when it was debated in Congress, denounced it as
unnecessarily punitive.
   ``I can't see any beneficial purpose being served by denying
individuals certain benefits simply because of the nature of the
offense that happens to be the big political issue of the time,''
said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU's Rhode Island
affiliate.
   Law-enforcement officials said they knew of no cases where the
law had been used since it was passed in November 1988.
   People convicted for a first offense of felony drug trafficking
could be ineligible for federal programs for five years. Benefits
would be denied for 10 years on a second offense and for life on a
subsequent conviction.
   Felony drug possession convictions could make someone ineligible
for one year on a first offense and five years on subsequent
convictions.
   The ACLU tried to have programs such as student loans and grants
exempted, said Janlori Goldman, the ACLU's legislative counsel in
Washington.
   ``Many student loans and grants are needs-based,'' she said.
   But the law specifically exempts only retirement, Social
Security, health, disability, veterans' or public housing benefits.
   Richard Wintory, director of the National Drug Prosecution
Center in Virginia, said the law still punishes people who might
not get prison, but exempts those who would be harmed by losing
federal benefits.
   ``The benefits that we're talking about ... are yuppie-type
benefits, they are middle-class benefits, they are government
freebies,'' Wintory said. ``Those are the people now that in the
criminal justice system get off the lightest. These are the
stockbrokers, lawyers, wealthy white kids.''
   The law also bars judges from denying benefits if someone was
addicted to drugs but had no treatment available or who had
undergone treatment and overcome a drug dependency.
   ``It's a pretty milquetoast provision as it is,'' Wintory said.

<TEXT>
   A former union boss, whose gun was used to kill
two anti-Marcos activists nine years ago, was charged with
aggravated first-degree murder in the slayings, prosecutors said
Thursday.
   Constantine ``Tony'' Baruso was president of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union when Gene Viernes and Silme Domingo were gunned down
in the union offices on June 1, 1981.
   Baruso, 62, was arrested at his home in Tacoma late Wednesday on
a warrant charging him with two murder counts, said King County
Prosecutor Norm Maleng. Baruso was being held Thursday in the King
County Jail on $500,000 bail. An arraignment hearing was scheduled
Friday.
   Baruso's attorney, Anthony Savage, said his client would plead
innocent. The charges arose out of new information that came to
light during a recent civil lawsuit filed by the victims'
relatives, Maleng said.
   Criminal charges initially were not filed against Baruso because
of insufficient evidence, he said.
   ``I've always said that this was an open case and that we would
be willing to look at any new evidence which might cast light on
Baruso's involvement with these murders,'' Maleng said.
   Authorities identified Baruso's handgun as the murder weapon but
said Baruso told them the weapon was stolen from him. Baruso was
later convicted of embezzling money from the union.
   Prosecutors would attempt to establish that Baruso's involvement
in the killings stemmed both from his interest in controlling the
union and in halting Viernes' and Domingo's work to end
gang-dominated gambling in Alaska fish canneries, Maleng said.
   Maleng also said prosecutors would try to show that Baruso
conspired with then-Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and Dr.
Leonilo Malabed of San Francisco, a Marcos friend, to kill the two
activists.
   Savage said Thursday he was surprised to hear of his client's
arrest.
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Savage said. ``We'll do our best to fight
it.''
   Three men, members of a Filipino gang called Tulisan, were found
guilty of murder at the original criminal trial. Prosecutors in
that case argued the killings stemmed from an internal union
dispute in which Domingo and Viernes worked to end the gambling in
Alaska fish canneries.
   But in the civil lawsuit, family members contended the slayings
were ordered from Manila because of Domingo's and Viernes' activism
against Marcos' regime.
   A U.S. District Court jury last December awarded the families
$15.1 million from the estate of Marcos, who died in Hawaii after
he was ousted in a coup, and from his widow, Imelda. U.S. District
Judge Barbara Rothstein later found Baruso and Malabed liable for
an additional $8.4 million.
   Family members expressed joy Thursday at Maleng's decision to
file murder charges.
   ``I knew that whether it took 10 to 20 years, someday he
(Baruso) would pay for these murders,'' said Cindy Domingo,
Domingo's sister.
   Joining her at a press conference was Domingo's widow, Terri
Mast, and their attorney, Michael Withey.
   ``We're convinced that the evidence against Baruso is
overwhelming,'' Withey said.
   Aggravated first-degree murder is the only crime in Washington
that carries the possibility of the death penalty. If prosecutors
decide not to seek death, the only alternative upon conviction
would be life in prison without parole.

   Iraq tightened the screws on trapped Westerners on Thursday,
warning that anyone trying to leave without permission could face
life in prison. The Soviet Union raised the possibility of Kremlin
support for sending a U.N. military force to the Persian Gulf.
   Saudi Arabia committed several billion dollars toward defraying
the enormous cost of the U.S. forces protecting the kingdom's oil
fields from possible Iraqi aggression, U.S. and Saudi officials
announced.
   U.S. officials said the Saudis would, at a minimum, pick up all
fuel, water and transportation costs for the 60,000 American troops
now in Saudi Arabia. Earlier this week, Secretary of State James
Baker III told Congress the U.S. presence would cost about $6
billion by year's end.
   Both U.S. and Saudi officials declined to provide a specific
price tag for the commitment.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pledged more forces to
bolster the U.S. contingent in the gulf. She did not elaborate on
the deployment plans.
   Egypt, too, said it was beefing up its small gulf contingent.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar planned to send an envoy to occupied Kuwait
to meet with diplomats whose embassies are surrounded by Iraqi
troops, and with trapped foreigners. Baghdad would have to give its
consent for the visit.
   The State Department again blasted Iraq for its treatment of
foreign nationals, including the shooting of an American in Kuwait
who was trying to avoid capture.
   Department spokesman Mark Dillen called Iraq's behavior
``outrageous'' and the deparment summoned the Iraqi ambassador to
the United States, Mohamed al-Mashat, to lodge a formal protest.
   Al-Mashat later called the incident ``unfortunate.'' He told
reporters the man had been ``slightly injured'' because ``he
violated the curfew and not because he was picked up as an
American.''
   Washington and Moscow, meanwhile, scrambled to prepare for the
weekend superpower summit they hope will bring a break in the
nearly 5-week-old crisis.
   President Bush said the United States was determined to force
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait, which Iraqi
troops overran Aug. 2 in a dispute over land, money and oil.
   ``We will not stand by while one country devours another
unthreatening country whole,'' Bush said at a Kansas fund-raiser.
``Our cause may not be easy, but it will always be right.''
   In a surprise move, Bush said he would make a statement for
broadcast to the Iraqi people, saying he saw ``a real opportunity''
to explain the U.S. view. Baghdad had offered to broadcast an
interview with Bush, but the White House said the president would
tape a statement instead.
   Statements by the Iraqi president _ which White House wags call
``Saddamathons'' _ have received ample air time in the United
States, and the Bush administration was reportedly irritated about
this.
   Word that Moscow might support a U.N. military force in the gulf
came from Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov. He
indicated Mikhail S. Gorbachev may discuss the idea with Bush at
their summit Sunday in Helsinki, Finland.
   Previously, the Soviets had said only that they might
participate if the United Nations decided to deploy a military
force.
   ``We have to go back to the U.N. charter and revive certain
clauses of this charter ... which may have armed forces _
international armed forces _ at its disposal so as to keep
international peace and security,'' Gerasimov told reporters.
   Gerasimov spoke a day after Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
met with Gorbachev and displayed no softening in Iraq's refusal to
leave Kuwait. Moscow and Baghdad were longtime allies, but
Gorbachev has condemned the Kuwait invasion as ``treachery.''
   Expenses escalate daily for the U.S. military deployment, and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady arrived Thursday in Seoul, South
Korea, the latest stop on a tour to press allies for funds.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III was making the same pitch in
Saudi Arabia, where much of the U.S. force is deployed.
   In Iraq, the outlook grew grimmer for trapped foreigners.
Baghdad said those caught trying to leave without permission could
face life in prison.
   Justice Minister Akram Abdul-Kader said authorities were
reviving a 1987 law that ``a foreigner violating the entry and exit
procedures ... will be sentenced to life or temporary imprisonment,
and all cash in his possession will be confiscated.''
   The State Department said Iraqi authorities had informed U.S.
officials that an American shot by Iraqi police in Kuwait was
expected to be discharged from a hospital shortly but will remain
in Iraqi custody. The department spokesman, Dillen, said the
American was wounded while attempting to evade capture at his
apartment in Kuwait City.
   ``We hold the Iraqi government responsible for the health and
welfare of all American citizens held against their will in Kuwait
and Iraq,'' Dillen said.
   Westerners were continuing to make their way out of Iraq and
Kuwait, under Saddam's promise to free foreign women and children.
Western men are being held as human shields to protect Iraqi
installations.
   An Air France jet flew into Paris from Jordan on Thursday
carrying 153 Westerners allowed to leave Iraq, including at least
nine Americans.
   A Canadian-chartered Iraqi plane carrying 157 people, most of
them Canadians, was headed for Toronto after leaving Iraq and
Kuwait and letting off five people during a stopover in Turkey. A
dozen Americans were among the passengers.
   The State Department also said it expected a U.S.-chartered
Iraqi Airways flight would leave Baghdad on Friday.
   A British Airways charter took off from Amman for London early
Friday carrying 250 British women and children refugees from
Kuwait, happy to be free but expressing fears for husbands left
behind. They arrived Thursday in Jordan on two Iraqi Airways
charter flights from Baghdad.
   A British convoy arrived in Baghdad from Kuwait on Thursday with
182 women and children. British diplomats in Baghdad said a second
convoy, including nine Americans, had also left Kuwait.
   Asians and Arabs were having an easier time than Westerners at
getting Iraqi permission to leave, but a much more difficult time
getting home. More than 100,000 Asian refugees are stuck in Jordan,
lacking transportation to get them back home.
   Meanwhile, there were signs the international unity against
Baghdad might be cracking. China and Iran suggested that food and
medicine should be sent to Iraq despite the U.N. economic sanctions.
   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said Thursday the
U.N. embargo ``does not include supplies intended strictly for
medical purposes and foodstuffs for humanitarian purposes.''
   Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani said last month that Iran
would abide by the embargo, but the English-language Tehran Times,
which is close to Rafsanjani, said in an editorial Thursday that
providing food and medicine was a ``humanitarian question.''
   In other developments:
   _Arab diplomats in Baghdad said King Hussein of Jordan might fly
to Moscow for talks with Gorbachev in advance of the Helsinki
summit. The Jordanian monarch returned home Thursday after two days
of talks with Saddam.
   _Oil prices soared over $31 a barrel Thursday, reaching that
plateau for the second time since the Persian Gulf crisis as
traders bet that supply shortages will develop.
   _The stock market took a sharp dive in the face of rising oil
prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 31.93 points
to 2,596.29.

   Ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang was seen
in public for the first time in about 16 months, playing golf with
his wife, Japanese diplomats said Thursday.
   The sighting was the first since May 1989, when Zhao made a
tearful visit to students demonstrating for democracy in Tiananmen
Square.
   A month later, after the violent June 3-4 military crackdown,
Zhao was stripped of all his posts. He was accused of ``splitting
the party'' by supporting the popular pro-democracy movement, which
officially is referred to as a ``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
   The diplomats said Zhao and his wife played golf for about two
hours Tuesday at a course near the Ming Tombs, a popular tourist
stop about an hour's drive north of Beijing.
   They said Zhao, whose hair had thinned and turned gray, was
guarded by about 10 security personnel.
   The diplomats were entertaining Japanese visitors when they saw
Zhao's entourage, the Japanese Embassy said.

   The 15 chiefs of U.S. corporations going to

   NASA engineers, embarrassed again by
a space shuttle that can't fly, set off anew today on a hunt
through a tangle of pipes for an elusive fuel leak that grounded
Columbia for a third time.
   ``It is a real booger to try to find and isolate,'' shuttle boss
Robert Crippen said after the mission was scrubbed Wednesday, 7{
hours before Columbia was to have lifted off at 1:20 a.m. today
with the $150 million Astro observatory.
   Engineers worked on a troubleshooting plan through the night,
but Crippen said that even if the hole were found immediately,
Columbia could not leave on its long astronomy mission for at least
three or four days and probably longer.
   The launch would have been the 36th shuttle flight and the first
in four months after a summer of similar leaks for NASA. That is
the longest gap between missions since flights resumed following
the Challenger disaster.

   Most Americans would flunk a test of basic
knowledge about sex, says a new survey that's old news to sex
experts.
   Fifty-five percent of people surveyed could not get at least 10
of the 18 questions right in the test, designed by the Kinsey
Institute.
   Half didn't know that a woman can become pregnant while having
her period, the report said. Half also did not know that some
lubricants, like petroleum jelly, shouldn't be used with condoms or
diaphragms. Petroleum jelly weakens rubber.
   Half the respondents incorrectly believed anal intercourse
itself can cause AIDS, even if neither partner is infected by the
virus; only 30 percent knew that menopause doesn't cause most women
to lose interest in sex; and only 35 percent knew that problems
with achieving erections usually are physical and can be treated.

   White House and congressional budget
negotiators have agreed on almost nothing during three contentious
months of bargaining. And now that they are about to resume
discussions, Saddam Hussein has made the job even harder.
   Iraq's conquest of oil-rich Kuwait has meant higher fuel costs,
and that has threatened to further slow the already sputtering U.S.
economy. Dispatching American troops to Saudi Arabia has driven up
Pentagon spending.
   Those changed economic and political circumstances will
complicate efforts to shrink the federal deficit when
administration officials and congressional leaders resume budget
talks on Friday.
   In preparation, House Democrats and Republicans held separate
budget sessions Wednesday and planned additional sessions today.

   In a major turnaround in Colombia's
anti-drug strategy, President Cesar Gaviria has announced that
cocaine traffickers who surrender will not be extradited to the
United States.
   The new president said his decree Wednesday is part of a plan to
end drug-related terrorism. A year-old war between the government
and traffickers fighting extradition has left hundreds of people
dead.
   ``Those who have been in crime and who have repented, and who
voluntarily turn themselves in to judges in order to freely confess
their crimes may be tried by our judges based on our judicial
order,'' Gaviria said in a nationally televised speech Wednesday
night.
   In July, the Medellin cocaine cartel declared a unilateral
cease-fire in its terrorist attacks, apparently hoping that the new
administration would end extraditions.

<HEAD>Physician Incomes On the Rise, Survey Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The median net income of office-based physicians
rose 12.8 percent last year to $132,500, and the credit may go to
the doctors themselves. They are becoming better businessmen.
   A survey by the magazine Medical Economics found the 1989 median
income rose $14,770, the biggest dollar increase in the 61 years
the survey has been conducted by the financial publication for
physicians.
   The article describing the study suggested higher incomes
resulted more from better business practices, especially more
efficient bill collection, than from a larger number of patient
visits or higher fees.
   It points out, in fact, that while median gross receipts rose
sharply, much of the revenue ``was gobbled up by a 19.8 percent
rise in professional expenses _ the steepest such increase of the
decade.''
   Nevertheless, the higher incomes could provoke controversy
because they come at a time when business, insurers, patients,
federal officials and the medical profession itself are seeking to
hold down steadily rising costs.
   The article points out that while the typical doctor ``had lost
six of his nine most recent yearly skirmishes with inflation, 1989
put him comfortably ahead for the decade.''
   While the Consumer Price Index rose 64.4 percent from December
1979 to December 1989, the article states that ``doctors cumulative
annual earnings growth for the period topped that figure by 8.4
percentage points.''
   However, doctors in family or general practice earned
considerably less than the median, with the former grossing
$211,540 and netting $97,340, and the latter grossing $170,423 and
netting $86,860.
   The study was based on questionnaires mailed in January to
31,976 medical doctors in private, office-based practice. By the
mid-May cutoff date, 9,762 responses had been trimmed to a working
sample of 6,484 questionnaires.
   The magazine stated that the survey was representative in terms
of physicians' field of practice, region and age, and therefore
``likely to be representative in other ways as well.''
   The responses showed cardiovascular surgeons as the highest paid
of all medical doctors, with a gross income of $493,750 and a net
of $296,300, followed by neurosurgeons at $455,560 and $256,600,
respectively.
   Orthopedic surgeons, plastic surgeons and ophthalmologists
followed, all with net incomes exceeding $200,000. Obstetric and
gynecological specialists, thoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists and
ear-nose-throat specialists followed at just under $200,000.
   Among other specialties, general surgeons were said to have
netted a median of $143,130, internists $110,500, psychiatrists
$103,570 and pediatricians $101,800.
   The highest median net for medical doctors in general was found
in the South Atlantic states, at $143,500, in the Mid-South at
$143,300 and in the Far West, including Alaska and Hawaii, at
$135,420.
   In order below them were the Southwest states at $132,500; the
Mideast states of New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey at
$131,790; the Great Lakes region at $125,830; New England at
$125,000; and the Great Plains at $123,750.
   The survey found the highest gross and net incomes in Florida,
at $282,500 and $157,950 respectively, representing a one-year
increase of $34,820, or 28.3 percent.
   In his commentary, Medical Economics editor Don Berg stated that
``this year could well be the last one of really big increases''
before Medicare caps and other restrictions begin.

<HEAD>Plugging in on Stage: The Other World Of Trip Shakespeare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trip Shakespeare has been living on the road for
three years. The van rides are long, the hotels look the same but
business hassles are left to others.
   It doesn't feel bad compared to what the Minnesota-based band
was doing before, holding onto part-time jobs and making the rounds
at the local clubs. No one's longing for that way of life.
   Trip Shakespeare is happiest on stage, when they can open up to
each other, learn a few things about themselves and create a world
a little prettier than the one they come down to once the
instruments are unplugged.
   ``That is almost the ultimate goal for us making music,''
explained bassist John Munson. ``That's something we want to do in
performance, create a different world, a place where everyone can
be, where the audience can be, forget the drudging pains of life
and bill collection and so on.''
   Fitting for a band that numbers Dr. Seuss and Rocky and
Bullwinkle among its influences, Trip Shakespeare includes plenty
of fractured fairy tales on ``Across the Universe,'' their first
album on a major label, A&amp;M Records.
   ``The Slacks'' is a naughty dance song about a one-eyed lady
from France with a fatal weakness for magic trousers. There's also
``Snow Days,'' a call from indoors to poor Mrs. Braintree, a
Minnesota schoolteacher and chilly northern woman stranded in a
winter blizzard, and ``Pearle,'' whose lovely heroine meets her
fate along the gullies by Deegan Curve.
   The love songs are open and painful, with no trace of bitterness
or hardened acceptance of loss, only a childlike grief over
something so natural being taken away. Just listen to the ballad
``Drummer Like Me,'' when the singer slips into a gentle falsetto
on ``Oh listen, some drummers have shaky time,'' his voice full of
doubt and fear.
   ``A lot of people that come to see us are pretty wide-eyed,
there's not a lot of cynicism,'' Munson insisted.
   ``Because we jam a lot, do it differently every time, there has
to be a level of trust between the band and audience. And the
audience is of all different sizes, shapes and colors. They're open
to what we're saying.''
   ``One thing that the songs have in common is they are works of
the imagination,'' added guitarist-pianist Dan Wilson, who spoke of
``Honey Tree,'' another ballad.
   ``The honey tree is someplace beyond this world. The garden
where that romance takes place is other-earthly. It's real, in the
same way that a dream is real.''
   Trip Shakespeare formed in Minneapolis in late 1986 as a trio,
the members including Matt Wilson, Dan's brother and who also
writes all the lyrics, Munson, and drummer Elaine Harris. Dan
Wilson joined a year later.
   There are no rap songs or exotic drugs or summer arts festivals
called Trip Shakespeare. The band members simply made up the name
one night and liked the sound of it, literary and humorous at the
same time.
   They released a pair of albums, ``Applehead Man'' and ``Are You
Shakespearienced?,'' on independent labels before signing with A&amp;M.
The sound is, appropriately, not quite of this world, a combination
of garage bands, folk harmonies and oldies albums sold on
late-night television.
   ``Somebody came up to us and said, `I know, the Left Banke and
Jeff Beck,' '' Munson recalled. ``And then someone will come up and
say the Zombies and Mott the Hoople, or, `You guys sound like a
cross between Peter, Paul and Mary and Led Zeppelin.'
   ``A lot of things about the band just sort of developed
organically. We never sat down and said, `Let's cop a folk sound,'
or `Let's get on that alternative music jag.' ''
   Records are made with live shows in mind and it works in the
other direction. The same way movie studios preview films to test
audience reaction, Trip Shakespeare experiments with its material
on stage, bending notes to the roar of the crowd.
   ``The road I travel is not divine,'' they sing on
``Turtledove.'' The routine these days is pretty simple: hit town,
set up the equipment and play, try to give the audience and
themselves and a world of honey trees in the sky and blessings on
the ground.
   ``About a year after Dan joined the band, we were in Iowa City
playing to about 250 people in a small room,'' Dan Wilson said.
``We took one song and wrestled with it on stage.
   ``We stretched it, pulled it at its edges, and ran off on
tangents for 25 minutes, just exploring the contours of the song
with each member taking off in different directions. That was a
moment when we realized something special was happening.''

   You want action? Send for the Norris
brothers, Chuck and Aaron.
   Chuck we know about. He's the nimble-footed, stolid-faced
destroyer of evil. Aaron is his younger brother, a former stuntman,
now director of Chuck's films, including the current ``Delta Force
2.''
   They recently got together at MGM for a discussion on how they
work together.
   ``Aaron's first film as director was `Braddock: Missing in
Action 3.' But Aaron had worked with me for 12 years as stunt
coordinator on my films,'' Chuck said. ``I'd seen him as a
second-unit director. As I watched him, I said, `This guy has a
tremendous amount of creative talent; he's very focused. If he ever
gets the opportunity to direct, I think he'll do exceptionally
well.' ''
   The opportunity came when the director of ``Braddock'' quit. The
producer rejected Chuck's suggestion of his brother as director.
Because of lack of preparation, the substitute director ``got
lost'' during the Philippines locations. Aaron to the rescue.
   ``One thing about Chuck is: He has focus. He knows where his
character is and where he should be at that given scene. It's a
great quality,'' Aaron said.
   ``We collaborate as a team, because one man never runs an entire
movie. The director has the focus of the entire film, but he
listens to everyone around him. That's why you hire all these
talented people.''
   What happens when they disagree?
   Chuck recalled a scene in ``Delta Force 2'' for which Aaron's
instructions ran counter to Chuck's instincts. The director
suggested shooting the scene two ways, deciding later which one was
right.
   ``We looked at the dailies the next day, and he was right,''
Chuck laughed. ``I never questioned him after that.''
   Any chance of sibling rivalry affecting their work together?
Chuck commented: ``Aaron's a lot younger than me. When we were
growing up, our mother had to work so I baby-sat Aaron. I must have
spanked him a few times, because now he's paying me back.''
   ``That's the beauty of this whole thing,'' added Aaron with a
laugh. ``For anyone who has had an older brother, this is a chance
to get back at him for all that stuff he gave me when I was young.
I put him through his paces on `Delta Force 2.' ''
   Indeed, Chuck Norris does some of his most perilous stunts,
including the scaling of a 12,000-foot peak and leaping out of an
airplane.
   ``But there's a limit,'' Aaron said. ``I came up through the
stunt community. I understand where that limit is. But he's real
game. I get him in tight places, but you go first and foremost for
safety. The last thing I ever want to do is hurt anybody.''
   For ``Delta Force 2,'' the Norris brothers returned to the
Philippines, which doubles for Colombia, where Chuck is warring
against the biggest drug lord of all. Will they become a permanent
team?
   ``I would like for it to be, whether Aaron directs or
produces,'' answered Chuck. ``If it works out that way, we'll be a
team in whatever the capacities may be. We work well together.''

   There's something reassuring about watching a
televised treasure hunt on the bottom of the sea.
   In this type of reality TV, there are no killings or threats of
gasoline shortages, no naval blockades or smiling dictators
stroking a captive child. There are just lovely dreams of gold.
   That's not to say it's easy finding, let alone digging up,
sunken treasure a mile and a half below the waves.
   The two-hour ``Treasures of a Lost Voyage,'' airing Sunday night
on cable's Discovery Channel, demonstrates why.
   The long-lost ship, S.S. Central America, had to be pinpointed
under thousands of square miles of ocean off the South Carolina
coast.
   The recovery crew then had to endure unpredictable weather,
temperamental, space-age retrieval equipment, and costly legal
fights with other searchers and a host of insurance companies over
who actually owns the estimated 3 tons of gold nuggets, assay bars
and coins that sank with the ship in 1857.
   ``It's a battle of man against nature. It's also a battle of man
against machines,'' said Barry Schatz, one of three project
directors for the Ohio group of investors and scientists that
located the wreck site in June 1986.
   Schatz also could have said lawyer against lawyer.
   It took four years and precedent-setting court rulings in a
Norfolk, Va., federal court for his Columbus America Discovery
Group to establish the legal right to a treasure that could be
worth $1 billion at auction.
   While the court battle dragged on, Columbus America's innovative
6-ton robot retriever-camera vehicle, Nemo, quietly plied the
wreckage, bringing up more than 2,000 pieces of gold bars and coins
through last summer.
   Experts believe that represents about a third of the gold that
weighed down the steam sidewheeler Central America when it
foundered in a hurricane in September 1857 while en route from
Panama to New York.
   It will take this and another summer-fall salvage season, at
least, for Nemo to collect the most-accessible artifacts from an
area the size of a football field, Schatz said.
   The ship, which carried 500 passengers and freight from the
California gold fields, took three days to sink as passengers and
crew bailed in vain. Four hundred twenty-five people died, with
some of the survivors telling of desperate passengers jumping
overboard fatally weighted down with gold.
   The Discovery program combines documentary footage of the gold
rush era with footage from the exciting 1986 discovery, along with
satellite-delivered views from the recovery vessel Arctic
Discoverer to update the progress of current salvage efforts.
   Nemo's cameras reveal startling images of piles and
``waterfalls'' of gold coins, bars and other artifacts. The views
are carried by wire up to a computer-crammed control room on the
recovery vessel.
   There, far from the crushing pressures and dark cold of the
wreck site, scientists under the direction of geologist-historian
Bob Evans control retrieval and research.
   It is increasingly common for TV cameras to accompany
adventurers or journalists _ even diplomats _ into the heat of the
action, but in this case, television actually helped make the event
happen.
   The Columbus America group, in what Schatz said was a first,
established its right to bring up the gold by ``possessing'' the
site through TV images, rather than actually laying hands on the
booty through manned diving.
   ``We were able to exert a presence and take possession as if we
were actually physically there,'' Schatz said, calling the new
legal doctrine ``telepresence'' or ``telepossession.''
   ``This will have very important applications for outerspace
law,'' he said.
   The search for the S.S. Central America, begun by Columbus
America founder Thomas Thompson, was motivated by gold, but
scientists realized the search would afford a unique opportunity to
study the ocean-bottom environment.
   ``The shipwreck is a biological oasis,'' Schatz said. ``It has
attracted an incredible diversity of deep sea life.''
   Three as yet unidentified species of life have been retrieved,
as well as a type of sponge that may prove useful in fighting
arthritis, he said.
   These unexpected spinoffs are icing on the cake for an already
spectacularly successful salvage effort.
   ``The investors said `Hey, let's find gold,' '' Schatz said.
``But they're really proud to be part of this other activity as
well.''

<HEAD>London Fall Theater: Politics, Joan Collins and the Redgrave
Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Current affairs dominate the new plays, and Joan
Collins and the Redgrave family are lending stardust to the
revivals as the London stage prepares a typically busy fall season.
   Collins returns to the stage Sept. 19 to play the barbed
divorcee Amanda in Noel Coward's ``Private Lives.'' Co-starring
Keith Baxter, the play will run at the Aldwych Theater through Jan.
12, 1991.
   The stylish 1930 comedy marks the actress's first West End
appearance since ``The Last of Mrs. Cheyney'' in 1980. Collins is
more widely known as the elegantly bitchy Alexis on TV's
``Dynasty,'' but her theatrical roots date back to the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), which she attended in the 1950s.
   In 1958, Vanessa Redgrave graduated from RADA's rival, the
Central School of Speech and Drama, and is among the world's most
acclaimed actresses.
   In December, at a theater to be announced, she joins sister Lynn
and Jemma Redgrave, daughter of her actor brother, Corin, in Anton
Chekhov's ``Three Sisters.'' Jemma replaces Vanessa's daughter,
Joely Richardson in the role of the youngest sister, Irina.
   The production, which runs Dec. 5-March 2 at the Queen's
Theater, follows this summer's production of ``Three Sisters,''
starring three Irish thespian sisters: Sorcha, Sinead and Niamh
Cusack. That production, which ends Sept. 29, has been a sellout in
both Dublin and London.
   ``Three Sisters'' is Redgrave's first stage role since her
controversial Broadway performance last fall in a revival of
Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus Descending.''
   ``Love Letters,'' A.R. Gurney's two-character American play
about a lifelong epistolary relationship, has its West End debut at
Wyndham's Theater on Oct. 1. Robert Wagner and Stephanie Powers,
co-stars of the TV series ``Hart To Hart,'' will play the leads for
one month, with other stars expected to follow if it is a hit.
   But mostly, the season's new plays are heavy on politics and
reflect recent headlines.
   The Royal Shakespeare Company's London season is focused on
``Moscow Gold,'' Tariq Ali and Howard Brenton's play about the era
of glasnost and perestroika under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   David Calder portrays Gorbachev and Sara Kestelman is his wife,
Raisa. They head a cast of 33 playing 102 parts. Mrs. Gorbachev has
not yet replied to an invitation to attend the premiere Sept. 26 at
the Barbican Theater.
   On Oct. 10, the Royal Court Theater opens Caryl Churchill's
``Mad Forest,'' an impressionistic look at Romania after Nicolae
Ceausescu's execution last December. First performed in June with
student actors at the Central School, the play was inspired by
Churchill's visit to the country last spring.
   Before opening here, ``Mad Forest'' will be performed in
Bucharest at the invitation of Andrei Serban, the new artistic
director of the city's National Theater.
   England's Royal National Theater comes to life with David
Edgar's ``The Shape of the Table,'' scheduled to open Nov. 8, the
day before the first anniversary of the crumbling of the Berlin
Wall. The play, about recent events in the Eastern bloc, uses the
tables at which new governments were negotiated as a metaphor for
the governments themselves.
   Edgar was the adaptor of ``The Life and Adventures of Nicholas
Nickleby,'' the Charles Dickens extravaganza that won the 1980 Tony
award for best play.
   Sir Michael Hordern, 78, plays a retired schoolmaster in Keith
Waterhouse's ``Bookends,'' opening the week of Oct. 22 at a theater
to be announced. The show, directed by Ned Sherrin, co-stars
Dinsdale Landen as Hordern's former star pupil. It comes from the
author, director and producer whose hit, ``Jeffrey Bernard Is
Unwell,'' is in its 11th month on the West End.
   American drama will be represented by Jerry Sterner's
off-Broadway hit ``Other People's Money,'' opening Oct. 17 at the
Lyric. Martin Shaw plays the Wall Street shark originated in New
York by Kevin Conway. Maria Aitken, who was John Cleese's wife in
``A Fish Called Wanda,'' co-stars.
   Virtually the only big new musical is ``Into the Woods,'' the
London premiere of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's 1987
Broadway show about fairy tales.
   The production, opening Sept. 25 at the Phoenix, promises to be
more stylized and less lighthearted than its Broadway predecessor.
Under Richard Jones' direction, Julia McKenzie stars as the Witch,
and Imelda Staunton is the Baker's Wife.
   Otherwise, London continues to host such hardy musical
perennials as ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables,'' ``Aspects of Love,''
``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Me and My Girl'' and ``Miss
Saigon.''

   ``Into the Woods,'' Stephen Sondheim's Broadway
musical fairy tale, takes on a grimmer look in London, with
blood-streaked walls and a moon that crashes down in the second act.
   ``It's a steady descent into bleakness and blackness,'' said
Julia McKenzie, who plays the witch in the 1987 Sondheim-James
Lapine musical opening Sept. 25 at London's Phoenix Theater.
   The show, budgeted at 1.2 million pounds ($2.23 million), is
directed by Richard Jones and designed by Richard Hudson, a team
who have been working jointly in opera and the subsidized theater
for the past decade.
   ``Into the Woods'' is the second Sondheim musical to receive a
major British production this year. His 1984 ``Sunday in the Park
With George'' finished a 15-week run June 16 at the Royal National
Theater.
   ``Into the Woods'' won three Tony awards including one for
Sondheim's score, but some critics saw it as a schizophrenic work
whose halves never quite meshed.
   The first act sends such fairy tale characters as Little Red
Riding Hood and Cinderella ``into the woods,'' where all end up
living happily ever after, their wishes fulfilled. In Act 2, their
happiness proves short-lived. A marauding giant emerges in the
woods, bringing death and devastation and belatedly teaching the
characters the importance of responsibility and companionship.
   McKenzie, inheriting Bernadette Peters' Broadway role, said this
new production would differ greatly from its predecessor. For a
start, the British cast can use its own accents, because the show
is set in no particular country.
   ``It's going to be very much one piece here,'' she said. ``It
won't look as pretty (as in New York); therefore, you'll be more
prepared for the ending.''
   This is McKenzie's fourth Sondheim musical in London following
``Company,'' ``Side by Side by Sondheim,'' and ``Follies.''
Sondheim is writing a song for her ``Into the Woods'' role that
wasn't in the long-running New York version.
   Designer Richard Hudson said he based his sets on extravagant
drawings from Victorian children's books, German fairy tales culled
from London's Goethe Institute and the 19th-century French
illustrator, Gustave Dore.
   ``It's a question of finding the right balance,'' he said. ``I'm
quite keen to make the show nastier. It's entertaining and
delightful, but there are moments where you go, `Oh my God.' ''
   Accordingly, the wallpaper of Act 1 will be seen peeling in Act
2; the benign moon hovering over the set will crash to the ground;
and when the wolf kills the grandmother, the walls will be streaked
with blood.
   ``It's been very, very meticulously worked out,'' said Hudson,
explaining that the tone should be ``kind of pessimistic.''
   Director Richard Jones wanted it to rain on stage at the end,
but they decided against that,'' Hudson said. ``The irony is that
these characters all talk about `happy ever after' but their lives
are not that brilliant.''
   The show walks ``a very, very fine line between shock horror and
laughter that is near hysteria,'' said McKenzie.

<HEAD>Pontiac Firebird Formula: Muscle Is Back</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto,Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Climb inside the 1991 Pontiac Firebird Formula and you'd swear
it was 1967 all over again.
   Just like during the muscle car era, there's no slinking quietly
around the streets. The throaty rumble of the 1991 Firbird's V-8
engine just emanates from below _ even at idle.
   Inside are all the trappings of a traditional American sports
car: low, body-hugging cloth seats, rear legroom that's miniscule,
and that big hump in the middle of the floor that indicates the car
is rear-drive, as always.
   Sure, the front and rear fascias have been restyled for the new
model. But all they succeed in doing is giving even more sporty
flair to the car than the previous model had, and a new rear
spoiler adds to the ``look-at-me'' Firebird package.
   Some things never change. Horsepower, image and flair were
hallmarks of the earliest Firebird. They remain today.
   The test car, a bright, speeding-ticket-red Firebird Formula,
had me fighting butterflies in my stomach when I punched the
accelerator and felt the car surge forward. There was no waiting as
the optional, tuned-port fuel-injected, 5-liter engine mated to
five-speed manual transmission responded, capable of delivering 225
horsepower.
   Suspension was stiff, offering good handling but a rough ride
over harsh bumps. But I wasn't on the bumps for long. This car just
flew over them.
   Fuel economy was as expected, a bit low at just 16 miles per
gallon in city driving. I had to get used to looking over the air
dam on the front hood. It is positioned right in front of the
driver, and with my 5-foot-4 stature, I had to sit up straight and
peer over the dam.
   I also had to get used to the long, heavy doors. They took a big
heave to shove open.
   And there wasn't a lot of space in the rear hatch area.
   Still, no one can really expect great storage space in a sports
car. Besides power and handling, the sound system and ambience are
important.
   In the Firebird, the premium sound system with graphic
equalizer, a $150 option, was superb; and the smallish, thick
steering wheel seemed a perfect fit. The dashboard design harkened
back to the 1960s, when the top shelf of the dashboard jutted way
in toward passengers. In the 1991 Firebird, there was about a
3-inch overhang where the top of the dash came over and stuck out
above the wide array of large, traditional, analog gauges.
   Typical buyers of the Firebird Formula are men (70 percent) who
are single, said company spokesman Reg Harris. Two-thirds are under
age 35, and between 30 percent and 40 percent have college degrees,
he said. The Firebird in all its models, the standard Firebird,
Firebird Formula, Firebird Trans Am and Firebird Trans Am GTA,
sells particularly well on the West Coast and in the Carolinas and
the Southeast, he added.
   It is interesting to note that more than two-thirds of Firebird
purchasers are first-time new-car buyers. Harris said they tend to
fall into one of two categories. The first group is people who put
great emphasis on the ``look'' of their car, they want the ``car of
their dreams.'' They are not necessarily car enthusiasts, but they
do want their car to give them a certain, powerful image, he said.
   The second group is people who like domestic cars, who are
``traditional car'' fans. Harris said these people can be
conservative in accepting new automotive technology and want a
vehicle that's tried and true.
   They certainly get it with the Firebird. Introduced in February
1967, the Firebird has racked up sales of more than 2.2 million
over the last 23 years.
   The best model year was 1978, when 175,607 were sold, according
to Pontiac. In recent years, sales have hovered around
50,000-60,000. For 1991, the company looks for sales between 50,000
and 55,000. Prices range from $11,985 for the standard Firebird to
more than $23,400 for the top-of-the-line GTA.
   Competitors include the Ford Mustang, which has a 5-liter engine
model that starts around $12,100, the Eagle Talon, which starts
around $13,000, and the Toyota Supra, which starts at more than
$22,800.
   Consumer Reports says 1983-87 Firebird V-8s were much worse than
average in owner complaints of trouble, and the 1988 model was
worse than average. Harris said the company has made many
improvements to bolster quality.

<HEAD>Harkin Battles History and Republicans in Senate Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WINTERSET, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freshman U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin is battling
history in his bid to defeat Republican challenger and congressman
Tom Tauke.
   Iowa voters never have given a Democratic U.S. senator another
term in office and Tauke is doing his best to ensure that Harkin
doesn't become the first.
   The two men are waging the most expensive political fight in
Iowa history. Harkin plans to spend $6 million, and Tauke, a
six-term congressman from northeast Iowa, hopes to answer with $5
million.
   Nowhere in the country, Harkin warned supporters recently, will
voters have a clearer choice this year and nowhere will Democrats
be pushed harder.
   ``They're coming after me with everything they've got,'' said
Harkin.
   The candidates began airing television commercials last spring.
   They have disagreed on abortion rights, the Persian Gulf crisis
and how they're paying for their well-financed campaigns.
   Through it all, Harkin, 50, has clung to a stubborn lead of 10
to 12 percentage points in most polls, though he's dropped
perilously close to 50 percent in those surveys.
   Republicans argue that Tauke, 39, has positioned himself to
overtake Harkin in the stretch, while Democrats say Tauke hasn't
made a dent in that lead and is running out of time.
   ``We're surprised that the race is not closer,'' said Harkin
spokesman Phil Roeder. ``A year ago heading into this campaign, we
anticipated it would be a dead heat going into the final couple of
months and it's not.''
   ``We couldn't be happier with where we are,'' said Tauke
spokesman Allen Finch. ``It's Labor Day and Harkin hasn't moved in
over a year and we've stayed within 10 points.''
   Harkin has emerged as a pesky critic of Republican presidents,
and GOP officials concede he's a tough campaigner.
   ``Absolutely, this is a tough one,'' said Iowa Republican
Chairman Richard Schwarm. ``This Senate race was going to be tough
any time, but Tom Harkin has proven relatively slippery.''
   Democrats have built a voter registration edge of roughly
100,000, ``but a Republican can certainly win statewide in Iowa
with those numbers,'' said Schwarm.
   The candidates are conducting an unprecedented series of four
prime-time debates broadcast on live commercial television
throughout the state.
   Tauke dug himself into a hole in the most recent campaign debate
focusing on abortion rights, some analysts say. In a state where
nearly two-thirds of voters consider themselves pro-choice, Tauke
staked out the hardest of anti-abortion positions, ruling out
abortions even for rape and incest victims.
   Harkin took a more moderate approach, outlining a generally
pro-choice position but saying he would be willing to consider
measures such as limited requirements that a parent be notified
before a minor gets an abortion.
   Tauke's staffers argue that he has long held anti-abortion
views, and couldn't afford to waffle on the issue. Critics said he
missed a chance to reach out to more moderate voters.
   Democrats saw it as one more thing going their way.
   ``I don't think we've seen a challenging candidate run such a
poor campaign,'' said Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Joe Shannahan.
   But Finch argued that issues like abortion are fading from
voters' minds in the face of world events.
   ``I think what can be said is the Persian Gulf has overshadowed
virtually all other issues,'' he said.
   ``We've got our base solidified and we're in single digits and
we'll seek to take the message to the voters as they increasingly
pay attention to the race,'' said Finch.
   Tauke is completely supportive of President Bush's efforts in
the Persian Gulf. Harkin has argued that more pressure should be
exerted on other nations for greater support, and he has criticized
Bush's decision to activate reserve units.
   Tauke criticizes Harkin for raising 90 percent of his larger
contributions from outside the state. Harkin responds that he has
backed campaign finance legislation thwarted by Republicans in
Congress.
   Both candidates are veteran campaigners. Harkin represented
southwest Iowa's 5th District for 10 years before ousting incumbent
Republican Sen. Roger Jepsen in 1984. Tauke has represented the
heavily Democratic 2nd District for 12 years.

<HEAD>Arnold Shapiro Makes Movie of Charles Stuart Story</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Tuesday in 7th graf is Sept. 25.</NOTE>

   Producer Arnold Shapiro had a head start in
shooting the CBS movie on Boston's Stuart murder case _ or so it
would seem.
   He just happened to have a camera crew in the area the night of
the incident, arriving at the scene minutes after Charles Stuart
was shot and his pregnant wife, Carol, was mortally wounded.
   The crew _ working for Shapiro's CBS series ``Rescue 911'' _ was
chasing the ambulance that pulled up to the bleeding couple on the
evening of Oct. 23, 1989. The dramatic footage of the Stuarts being
removed from their car and given emergency treatment was broadcast
last February to a wide audience.
   But the ``Rescue 911'' crew shot on videotape, and the Stuart
movie became a 35mm film project. The two mediums don't cut
together effectively, so everything was re-enacted.
   Shapiro's location in Boston that night gave him a head start of
a different kind, however. In the industry rush to film the Stuart
story, the producer had a leg up on the competition.
   ``We had all this research and all the contacts,'' Shapiro said.
``Everyone in Hollywood wanted to do the movie. But we'd already
been on it.''
   ``Good Night, Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston,'' scheduled for
Tuesday night, stars Ken Olin as Stuart and Margaret Colin as
Michelle Caruso, a reporter who doubted Stuart's story of the
shootings.
   Boston police had vigorously searched for the killer in the
city's black community after Stuart said the couple had been
attacked by a black man. A black suspect even was jailed for a
time, sparking allegations of police racism and raising ethnic
tensions.
   Charles Stuart, who was white, eventually became the prime
suspect in the slaying of his wife. As a web of evidence engulfed
him, he committed suicide in January of this year.
   ``The racial issues this story raises are not unique to Boston.
We need to explore why Stuart was able to fool virtually
everyone,'' Shapiro said. ``A large part of this movie is trying to
understand Stuart's behavior. If one police department is more
skeptical the next time a similar crime occurs, I will be
fulfilled.''
   Michelle Caruso, a crime reporter for the Boston Herald, was one
of the few people who doubted Stuart's story from the start, he
said.
   ``This shows you should not act in haste,'' Shapiro said. ``The
media and the police bought Chuck Stuart's story hook, line and
sinker. He said a black man did it, and that set off a near racial
war. The husband or the boyfriend is always a suspect in a murder
like this. Why wasn't Chuck? Because his self-inflicted wound was
so bad he nearly died.''
   Shapiro moved the Stuart movie's production site to Chicago to
avoid any incidents in Boston, where passions still run high over
the case.
   The movie also stars B.D. Wong, James Handy, Bruce McGill,
Michael C. Gwynne and Annabella Price as Carol Stuart. Jerrold
Freedman directed from a screenplay by Dan Freudenberger.
   ``All the actors looked at the `911' show and all the raw
footage to make it as accurate as possible,'' Shapiro said. ``It's
been a challenging movie to make. As of this date, the grand jury
hasn't come back with its findings about whether any living person
should be charged. There are some things we may never know that
Chuck Stuart may have taken to the grave.''
   The Stuart film was to have been broadcast opposite the season
premiere of ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' which also stars Olin. But
MGM Television, producers of ``thirtysomething,'' objected, and the
Stuart movie was postponed a week.
   This is not the first time Shapiro has turned a documentary
situation into a television movie. His 1978 Academy Award-winning
documentary ``Scared Straight'' became the 1980 CBS movie ``Scared
Straight! Another Story.''
   The walls in Shapiro's office are covered with pictures and
mementos that attest to his documentaries on aviation, the battle
of Iwo Jima, American prisoners of war, the Unknown Soldier and the
Korean War.
   As his ``911'' goes into its third season, he's preparing a new
reality series for CBS called ``True Detectives,'' which will tell
stories of professional and amateur sleuths who solved baffling
mysteries.
   The biggest challenge in filming the Stuart story, Shapiro said,
was not the uncertain ending, but cutting the wealth of material to
fit a two-hour format.
   ``I think this is a story that could have happened in any
American city,'' he said. ``It offers some broad national lessons.
You can't say enough about the horror of violence against women and
children. That one reason alone would be enough for me to make this
movie.''

   Here are some facts and figures about
Gypsies:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NUMBERS _ An estimated 6 million Gypsies live in Eastern Europe,
including 3 million in Romania, 1 million in Hungary, 1 million in
Bulgaria, 600,000 in Czechoslovakia and about 40,000 in Poland. No
official statistics exist.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LANGUAGE _ Romany is spoken by most unassimilated Gypsies. It is
an ancient language rooted in Sanskrit or early Hindi, and has
evolved differently in each East European country. Some versions of
Romany are so divergent that Hungarian Gypsies, for instance, have
trouble communicating with those from Romania or Bulgaria.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The first Gypsies arrived in Europe about 900 years
ago from northern India, but mass migrations to the continent did
not begin until the 14th century. Their nomadic lifestyle and
refusal to adapt led to increasing persecution in western Europe
and migration to the eastern regions, where they were allowed to
work as itinerant craftsmen and musicians and in other nomadic
occupations.
   Pressure to conform was applied systematically in the late 18th
century, when Austria's Queen Maria Theresa, who controlled much of
eastern Europe, issued decrees designed to assimilate Gypsies
forcibly into the serf class. Persecution continued, culminating in
the Nazi extermination of an estimated 500,000 Gypsies.

<TEXT>
   For weeks, the denizens of midtown Manhattan had
puzzled about the strange, pervasive grinding noises audible in the
streets and in the the corridors of the towering skyscapers.
   It turned out, of course, that the sounds were network
television executives wearing out the enamel on their molars.
   What has gone wrong with the Republic? they wondered. From 90
percent of the potential TV audience in 1980, the Big Three had
sunk to splitting 65 percent between them. Where had all the people
gone?
   The fall television season of 1990 was approaching. They were
out of ideas. There was nothing left to do but make something up.
Or head for the sidewalk, either by the elevator or a long,
whistling free fall out the window.
   So they came up with 35 new shows, the greatest number of
original programs in TV history. Nineteen of them _ 54.3 percent _
are situation comedies. And, as usual, there are precious few
programs worth celebrating.
   The biggest disappointment is Fox Broadcasting Co., which got a
reputation for innovative programming. Fox scared the Big Three
spitless by stealing 10 percent of the viewership without even
reaching the entire country.
   Judging by its fall offerings, the weblet has gone from limber
youth to doddering old age.
   Five of its 10 shows are sitcoms. One, ``True Colors'' is the
mildest statement about biracial marriage since ``Good luck, you
crazy kids. You're going to need it.'' It does not remotely
resemble innovative programming.
   Even though Corin Nemec plays a greedy little hustler, the
network's ``Parker Lewis Can't Lose'' is a fun, fine high-school
fantasy bound to appeal to younger viewers. It's just too bad that
the show, Fox's best new comedy, stops at satirizing high school.
   ``American Chronicles,'' a slick, sleek documentary, is visually
classy, but its popular appeal is uncertain. ``DEA'' is visually
distinctive but turns out to be just another cop show that's
underwritten somewhat more than most.
   Both Fox and ABC have done their bit to hasten the demise of
home video programming.
   ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' has tacked on the
wretched ``America's Funniest People,'' and Fox has added
``Haywire'' to its ``Totally Hidden Video.'' Both shows feature
Americans making fools of themselves.
   ABC offers only six new shows, which reflects the strength of
their established programs. Half of the new crop are sitcoms, and
only two of the six are worth watching.
   ``Gabriel's Fire'' brings James Earl Jones back to television,
where his strength and dignity are sorely needed. He plays an
ex-con ex-cop who brings the skills of both to his job as a
lawyer's investigator.
   ``Cop Rock'' is Steven Bochco's engaging knockoff of Dennis
Potter's stylish ``Pennies from Heaven'' and ``The Singing
Detective.'' But even those two PBS miniseries never tried to blend
rock music and police action.
   The show works, but it's an open question whether music
supervisor Mike Post can find composers capable of keeping up the
standard set by Randy Newman in the series premiere.
   Third-ranked CBS, whose 11 new shoes were the most offered by
any network, had the fewest shows ready for reviewers. Some of them
won't see the airwaves until October.
   ``Evening Shade'' will have to fall through the earth's crust to
fail. Is it even possible that a sitcom could fail with a cast of
Burt Reynolds, Marilu Henner, Elizabeth Ashley, Ossie Davis,
Charles Durning and Hal Holbrook?
   ``WIOU'' _ also not available for previews _ has a cast that
includes John Shea, Helen Shaver, Mariette Hartley, Dick Van
Patten, Harris Yulin and Phil Morris. It's about TV journalism and
has all kinds of chances to fail.
   The little screen has not been kind to comic book superheroes,
so unless ``The Flash'' has great special effects and even better
writing, the Scarlet Speedster's prospects for renewal are dimmer
than the Six Million Dollar Man's.
   They're not dimmer than ``E.A.R.T.H. Force,'' which is by turns
pompous, improbable, ungrammatical and unintentionally funny.
   Five of NBC's nine new shows are worth making time for.
   The long pilot episode for ``Parenthood'' was one of the best
shows in the preview crop, with Ed Begley Jr. and William Windom in
peak form. It's a half-hour that cries out for another 30 minutes
just to let the characters breathe.
   Despite the grim-sounding premise of a high school musical
comedy, ``Hull High'' makes a joyful noise. It's clever, funny,
full of subtle touches, and it genuinely likes teen-agers and the
people who teach them.
   Another winner is ``American Dreamer,'' which brings the
wonderful Carol Kane back to TV and proves that Robert Urich can
indeed do comedy. The script is funny and the chemistry between
Kane and Urich is unmistakable.
   ``The Fanelli Boys'' is the best sitcom NBC has to offer. Mama
(Ann Guilbert) and her four sons are a funny bunch.
   ``Law &amp; Order'' stars George Dzundza as a police detective who
arrests criminals, and Michael Moriarty plays the prosecutor who
tries them. The hour goes quickly.
   There may be other worthwhile shows, but they're still not
available to reviewers.
   The start of the network season still is Sept. 17, but the
network executives have thoroughly confused things by trying to
stir up interest in the shows they've already got in the can.
   NBC ran a ``double pump'' and previewed several shows ahead of
that date. Fox put out early episodes of its shows, too. CBS and
ABC scheduled a few early shows the week before the official season.
   At the end of August, A.C. Nielsen Co. expanded its known
``universe'' of U.S. television households from 92.1 million to
93.1 million, even though the audience is dwindling and becoming as
independent-minded as a hog on ice.
   What would happen if the executives gave a fall TV season and
nobody came?

<HEAD>AGATHA CHRISTIE: The Queen of Crime Reigns 100 Years After Her
Birth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUDREY WOODS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tidy gray hair, impeccable tweeds and
respectable air immediately identified Dame Agatha Christie: an
upper-middle-class Englishwoman of a time and place when class
defined a person's life.
   Child of prosperous and loving parents, loyal wife and devoted
mother, she was a woman who spent more than 50 years writing about
murder, hatred, jealousy and guilt with a cool skill that made her
one of the best-selling novelists ever.
   Dame Agatha, born Sept. 15, 100 years ago, wrote 147 short
stories, 15 plays and 90 novels, most of which are still readily
available at neighborhood bookstores. They have sold more than 2
billion copies in 45 languages, and 14 years after her death they
sell about 25 million copies a year, her publisher says.
   Some of them sell better now than when first published _ and
this without sex, obscene words, overt violence or naked passion.
   ``She was the patron saint of insomniacs,'' Anthony Curtis said
in the Financial Times after her death in 1976. ``Her readers were
not merely legion, they included most literate persons above the
age of 10.''
   Despite her fame, Agatha Christie spent most of her life well
out of the public eye, a shy and intensely private woman who
probably would have been dismayed to discover what a fuss is being
made over her centenary.
   Her birthplace, the south coast town of Torquay, is holding an
international crime writers convention, a series of lectures on the
author and the world championships of the mystery board game Cluedo
(Clue in the United States).
   The local theater is reviving Christie plays, new editions of
her books are appearing and hotels are holding ``murder weekends''
for guests to play detective.
   ``The Mousetrap,'' her most famous play, is still going strong
in London after 38 years and has been seen by more than 8.5 million
people.
   Lavish films of Christie stories have been huge TV and film
successes. Actors as diverse as Peter Ustinov, Albert Finney and
David Suchet have portrayed detective Hercule Poirot, while Angela
Lansbury and Joan Hickson pick up Miss Marple where Margaret
Rutherford left off.
   An Agatha Christie murder seems cozy and polite, committed for
the most part out of sight by the most ordinary people. Her books
are filled with comfortable stereotypes of benign clerics,
gossiping spinsters, foolish servants and retired military men.
Less comfortable racial and religious stereotypes also crop up.
   Some critics say Agatha Christie was not a particularly good
writer, and she was always modest about her gifts.
   ``I'm very lowbrow,'' she said in 1971 while expressing surprise
at being made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II. ``A lot of people have
written books.''
   But others, such as H.R.F. Keating, admire her: ``She was very
skillful, her timing was marvelous ... and she was a very good
storyteller.
   ``She was a reasonably ordinary person in herself and didn't
attempt to be more in her writing. So she appeals to the ordinary
in all of us,'' said Keating, author of the Inspector Ghote
mysteries and president of the venerable Detection Club of crime
writers, which Christie headed for many years.
   She had a powerful imagination and an inventiveness that
blossomed, so she said, in the bath. There she ate apples as she
soaked, plotting her next story.
   Her most famous character is Poirot, the tidy Belgian detective
with the waxed mustache who solved 34 of her mysteries in books and
dozens more in short stories. Christie introduced him in her first
novel, ``The Mysterious Affair at Styles,'' published in 1920.
   The endearingly egotistical Poirot, with his patent leather
shoes and exquisite tailoring, solves puzzles with his ``little
gray cells,'' imposing order on tangled clues in the same
meticulous way he arranges his perfectly symmetrical life.
   Christie brought Poirot back in 1926 for ``The Murder of Roger
Ackroyd,'' the book that made her famous with a shocking ending
that nobody, but nobody, could guess. Readers who had watched every
one of the suspects eliminated cried foul when they found out
whodunit _ but they didn't stop reading Agatha Christie.
   Seven months after ``Roger Ackroyd'' made her a celebrity, this
reserved woman with a horror of publicity created a sensation.
   Agatha Christie disappeared Dec. 3, 1926, the day her husband,
Col. Archibald Christie, told her had fallen for a young woman
named Nancy Neele and wanted a divorce. Agatha's car was found
abandoned and a nationwide search began. She was found 11 days
later in a northern England hotel, reportedly suffering from
amnesia and registered as Teresa Neele. She never explained, not
even in her posthumously published autobiography.
   The Christies divorced in 1928. Their only child, Rosalind, grew
up with her mother. In 1930, Agatha Christie married Max Mallowan,
a distinguished archaeologist 13 years younger than she, whom she
met on a trip to Iraq.
   Eight years after ``Roger Ackroyd,'' Christie wrote one of her
most famous books, ``Murder on the Orient Express,'' in which
Poirot questions suspect after suspect on a snowbound train and
can't seem to eliminate them.
   Almost as famous as Poirot is Jane Marple, the English spinster
whose lifelong study of her village neighbors has taught her about
motive. ``Human nature is much the same everywhere,'' Miss Marple
points out, homing in on the murderer without dropping a stitch of
her knitting.
   Christie's skills were self-taught. Her mother believed
education would be hard on her eyes, so she kept her at home, a
substantial house where she was born Agatha Miller, the youngest of
three children.
   Her wealthy American father was fond of his club. Her doting
mother presided over a household run by servants, and young Agatha
absorbed the details of upper-middle-class life that would set so
many scenes in her mysteries.
   These settings, enhanced in nostalgic detail in films and
television, today seem as much a part of the Christie appeal as do
the stories. Here, perhaps more perfect than they ever really were,
are the 1930s chic of London's bright young things and the
sun-dappled, country-house leisure of a class that thought it would
rule for eternity.
   Preserved forever are the rural hamlet with a constable on his
bicycle, and the seaside hotel with its potted palms and string
quartet.
   Christie was not like the sheltered women who populate her
fictional villages. She traveled widely, knew personal scandal and
despair, and met and observed people from many cultures. But her
modest manner is the image that lasts.
   ``I'm not very good at talking,'' she once said. ``Writing is a
great consolation to people like me who cannot express themselves
well any other way.''
   She said it wasn't easy.
   ``The real hell ... is having to tie up all the loose ends in
the last chapter. By the time you've done it you're sick of
everybody in the book.''
   She wrote Poirot's and Miss Marple's last cases in the 1940s for
posthumous publication, but allowed Poirot's ``Curtain'' to be
published before her death.
   One secret she kept for nearly 20 years, until 1949, was Mary
Westmacott, the name under which she wrote six straight novels.
``Absent in the Spring,'' published in 1944, was ``the one book
that satisfied me completely ... the book I had always wanted to
write, that had been clear in my mind.''
   But these novels never captured the public as her mysteries did.

<TEXT>
   Far from Agatha Christie's rural village, two of
today's best crime writers have staked out their territory on the
grimy streets of the inner city and the secret anxieties of
suburbia.
   Ruth Rendell and P.D. James hold their own at the top of
best-seller lists and, in the eyes of some critics, have moved the
crime novel toward mainstream fiction.
   Their concern for the ``why'' of crime and their talent for
making killer and victim as real as your next-door neighbor
separate them from most of the writers of the Golden Age of crime
writing.
   From the 1920s through the 1940s, the upper-class sleuths of
Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh and Margery Allingham, with their
servants and exciting escapades, offered millions of readers an
escape from the Depression and World War II.
   In those classic tales, distinguished crime writer Julian Symons
says, ``The General Strike of 1926 never took place, trade unions
did not exist and when sympathy was expressed for the poor it was
not for the unemployed but for those struggling along on a fixed
inherited income. ... Murder was committed over and over again
without anybody getting hurt.''
   Ruth Rendell told a literary gathering, ``Long before I was
first published, the crime writer had ceased to be expected to
assemble 12 people in a country house, murder one of them and have
a snowstorm maroon the rest indoors.''
   Rendell's 34 novels may provide escape from the reader's own
worries, but they offer no refuge from the dark side of human
nature. The perverse and sexually maladjusted turn up in the world
of her ruggedly honest provincial detective, Inspector Reginald
Wexford, and his up-tight sidekick, Burden.
   But in her non-Wexford stories and the books she writes under
the name Barbara Vine, they get the upper hand.
   ``A Judgment in Stone'' is about a family slain by their
housekeeper because they discovered the secret that shamed her all
her life. She could not read or write. In a ``A Demon in My View,''
judged the best crime novel of 1976, the killer takes to strangling
real women when he is deprived of the store dummy he liked to
throttle every now and then in the cellar.
   Rendell's writing reflects her time, with its urban
frustrations, mental stress and sense of the individual losing
control of his own life.
   Like Rendell, Phyllis Dorothy James does not back away from
violent death. And the reader is not excused from the room. Murder,
she says, is ``the ultimate crime, the one for which you can't ever
make reparation.''
   Murder and its discovery are central to the book and ``we should
see it, experience it,'' she said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
radio series on mystery writers.
   ``The character of the victim is just as important as the
character of anyone else in the book,'' James said. ``Unless we
understand him and care something about him, we're not going to
care whether he dies or not.''
   Her widowed police Inspector Adam Dalgliesh, a poet, finds his
criminals by following clues in the traditional murder mystery
style.
   But the author uses her strong Anglican faith and interest in
moral dilemmas to enrich her 11 mysteries and stretch the limits of
crime fiction. She has no interest in crime novels in which the
murderer is a psychopath or has ``no sense of sin.''
   ``She is more interested in using the detective story to write a
novel of character,'' says critic H.R.F. Keating, author of the
Inspector Ghote mysteries.
   ``She has, always, a whodunit interest which keeps your head
down in the book. But as you read on, wanting to know whodunit, you
get these pictures of very real and interesting people, seen in a
moral climate.''
   There's a constant presentiment of imminent disaster in
Rendell's work, something she attributes to her childhood _ a
loving father who nonetheless ``looked for sorrow rather than
happiness in life'' and a mother, ``a vague, strange woman,'' whose
multiple sclerosis was little understood in those days.
   ``So I think I was imbued from a very early age with a sense of
doom,'' the 60-year-old writer said.
   P.D. James, 70, says she has been fascinated with death since
childhood. ``I had a feeling always when people made plans: `Yes,
but we might not be here.' ''
   Her view of humanity is stern.
   The doctrine of original sin, she said, ``seems to me pretty
well to conform to the facts. ... We are fallen in the sense that
basically we are selfish and violent creatures disposed, really
always, to put our interests first.''
   The great sadness of her own life _ a young husband who returned
from the war a schizophrenic and spent the rest of his life in and
out of hospitals _ does not appear to have altered her perspective.
   ``I never felt `why me?' probably because it doesn't need very
much imagination to look at the world and see greater suffering.
And `why not me?' ''

<HEAD>Minnesota Governor's Race Tops 11-Election Primary Lineup Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Rudy Perpich is a non-stop booster of Minnesota and, not
coincidentally, his own political fortunes in a tight gubernatorial
primary that is one of 11 elections Tuesday to fill out the 1990
campaign lineup.
   ``We are without doubt the No. 1 state in the nation,'' Perpich
tells voters as he campaigns to stave off a tough primary challenge
from Mike Hatch, a former state commerce commissioner.
   In other Tuesday primaries, Arizona Republicans will decide
whether to endorse Evan Mecham's bid to regain the office from
which he was ousted two years ago, while veteran politicians in New
Hampshire and Vermont also are making comeback bids.
   Jesse Jackson is on the District of Columbia ballot for the
symbolic office of ``shadow senator,'' his first bid for an office
other than president. Voters in the nation's capital also will
choose candidates in the race to succeed Marion Barry as the city's
mayor.
   Also going to the polls on the busiest day of the primary season
are voters in Connecticut, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, Utah
and Wisconsin.
   Only four states _ Massachusetts, Washington, Hawaii and
Louisiana _ have yet to hold primaries. Runoffs are scheduled to
settle contests in Oklahoma and Florida.
   While the parties choose their nominees, independent candidates
are playing an unusually significant role.
   Former Republican Sen. Lowell Weicker is running as an
independent and leading in the polls in the race for governor of
Connecticut. Rep. John Rowland already has the Republican
nomination for governor, while Rep. Bruce Morrison and state
legislator Bill Cibes are competing for the Democratic nomination.
Gov. William O'Neill, a Democrat, is retiring.
   In the District of Columbia, Barry is running as an independent
for a seat on the city council where he served before being elected
mayor in 1978. Barry was convicted last month on a misdemeanor
charge of possession of cocaine.
   City council members John Ray, Charlene Drew-Jarvis and David
Clarke, congressional delegate Walter Fauntroy and lawyer Sharon
Pratt Dixon are the Democratic contenders to succeed Barry. Former
police chief Maurice Turner is unopposed for the Republican
nomination for mayor.
   Jackson, who moved to Washington from Chicago a year ago and
mulled entering the race for mayor, is one of four Democrats
seeking nomination to become one of two shadow senators, whose job
would be to lobby Congress to make the city the 51st state. Shadow
senators lobbied Congress to win support for statehood for
Tennessee, Michigan, California, Minnesota, Oregon and Alaska.
   Perpich has served as governor of Minnesota for 10 years. He was
appointed to finish the last two years of former Gov. Wendell
Anderson's term in 1978 and then won election to the office in 1982.
   Hatch has mounted a strong challenge this year, focusing on
scandals involving two close Perpich associates and a perception
that Minnesotans are looking for a change.
   ``After eight years, past mistakes and personal vanities become
the focus of an administration,'' said Hatch.
   Perpich countered by telling Minnesotans they were living in the
best state in the nation.
   ``There isn't a state that's better than we are,'' he said
during a televised debate with Hatch. ``In 1983, we couldn't
compete with South Dakota. Today, we're beating the world.''
   The governor also scored a late spring coup when Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev paid a one-day visit to the state
after his June summit with President Bush.
   A mid-August poll showed Perpich and Hatch were in a dead heat
among members of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, the state's
equivalent of the Democratic Party.
   But a survey published Wednesday said Perpich had opened a
17-point lead over Hatch.
   An unusual race also is taking place for the GOP nomination for
governor of Minnesota. State auditor Arne Carlson had an 18-point
lead in the latest poll over Jon Grunseth, a St. Paul businessman
who was endorsed by the state party.
   Party leaders attacked Carlson as out of step with their
positions on crime, gun control and abortion. The attacks abated
only after a backlash from contributors who threatened to withhold
funds.
   In the Democratic Senate primary, college professor Paul
Wellstone and state Agriculture Commissioner Jim Nichols are
competing for the nomination to oppose GOP Sen. Rudy Boschwitz.
   Millionaire developer Fife Symington is the front-runner for the
Republican nomination for governor of Arizona, but no one is
prepared to write off Mecham's chances to capture the nomination in
the five-candidate field, particularly if there is a low turnout.
   The 66-year-old former car dealer was elected governor in 1986
and impeached and removed from office two years later on the basis
of allegations he misused funds from supporters and interfered with
the police investigation of an alleged death threat by one of his
aides.
   But the impeachment charges generated less controversy than many
of Mecham's positions as governor, particularly his opposition to a
state holiday commemorating the birth of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
   In the Democratic primary for governor, former Mayor Terry
Goddard of Phoenix has only token opposition.
   Three Democrats are battling in Rhode Island to challenge
Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete, whose approval rating in a Brown
University poll dipped below 20 percent.
   Mayors Joseph R. Paolino Jr. of Providence and Francis X.
Flaherty of Warwick and businessman Bruce G. Sundlun are in a close
Democratic race.
   DiPrete, first elected governor in 1984, is heavily favored over
talk show host Steve White in the GOP primary.
   In Vermont, Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a Democrat, is retiring after
three two-year terms. Kunin was elected governor after Republican
Richard Snelling decided not to seek re-election in 1984 to a fifth
term.
   Now it's Snelling's turn and he is running to succeed Kunin.
Both Snelling and Democrat Peter Welch face only token opposition
in their party primaries.
   In neighboring New Hampshire, voters in both parties have plenty
of choices.
   Former Sen. John Durkin, a Democrat who lost his seat to Warren
Rudman in 1980, is attempting a comeback in a crowded primary. Also
competing for the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring GOP
Sen. Gordon Humphrey are Nashua Mayor James Donchess and
businessman John Rauh.
   In the GOP primary, Rep. Bob Smith is favored over Thomas
Christo, who has complained that White House chief of staff John
Sununu, a former New Hampshire governor, has intervened on behalf
of Smith.
   In the New Hampshire governor's race, former state Democratic
Party chairman Joseph Grandmaison is favored to win his party's
nomination to challenge Republican Gov. Judd Gregg.
   The biggest issue in the campaign for the Republican nomination
for governor of Maryland has been whether front-runner William
Shepard acted properly when he designated his wife, Lois, as his
candidate for lieutenant governor. That move prompted Ross Z.
Pierpont to launch his fourth campaign for governor.
   Whoever wins will have a formidable task challenging incumbent
Democratic Gov. William Donald Schaefer, heavily favored for
renomination.
   Two Republican congressional primaries hold the interest in
Utah. In the Second District, former Rep. Dan Marriott and
geologist Genevieve Atwood are competing for the nomination to
challenge Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens.
   In the heavily Republican Third District, Rep. Howard Nielson is
retiring and former state Sen. Karl Snow and think-tank chairman
and businessman John Harmer are seeking the GOP nomination to
succeed him. Bill Orton, a Provo lawyer, is the Democratic nominee.
   In Wisconsin, Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson has only token
primary opposition. His Democratic opponent, Assembly Speaker
Thomas Loftus, has no primary opposition.
   In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo and his GOP opponent, Pierre
Rinfret, already have their party nominations and will not even be
listed on Tuesday's primary ballot.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Is Media Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops, tanks and planes remain poised at the ``line in the
sand'' drawn by President Bush in the Gulf crisis. Both sides have
held their fire, but another struggle has been taking place in the
form of a public relations war, complete with communiques,
satellite TV and news conferences.
   How good a job has the U.S. news media done in sorting it all
out? The Associated Press checked with six specialists for their
opinions on that element of the conflict. Here are their responses:
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   There is a tendency for the story of this crisis to follow two
tracks _ one a story of global political intrigue, another a moral
tale of right and wrong, of hero and villain. Either course
obscures the fact that the presence of American troops in Saudi
Arabia (and, of course, Iraqi troops in Kuwait) is essentially an
economic story: At issue is the world's oil supply, and not least
the United States'. . . .
   The media try to map out the issues, to explain who the parties
are and what they are saying, to assay interests and motivations. .
. . (But) the press soon goes beyond the story of global politics
to the people on the ground, the naval and military personnel who
ultimately fight a war if there is to be one. While
well-intentioned, this coverage sometimes serves only to trivialize
the larger issues.
   At the same time, however, some of that coverage leads us to
question precisely what and who we are fighting for and whether the
price of American lives is worth paying. Recently some journalists
have begun to probe at these points, but if previous conflicts are
any guide, the larger prospect for the press is not encouraging.

   Good journalism is supposed to show at least two sides of an
issue, but coverage of the Gulf crisis has been very one-sided.
U.S. news media have allowed Bush supporters to virtually drown out
articulate critics of his Persian Gulf policy.
   Instead of asking tough questions, we've seen too much media
cheerleading and saber-rattling on behalf of the president.
Supposedly neutral reporting has often given way to worshipful
prose about the ``masterful leadership'' of the commander-in-chief.
   Reporters ought to be raising the real issues. Doesn't Bush's
rhetoric about ``Saddam controlling the oilfields'' ring hollow
when OPEC, in cahoots with Western oil companies, would continue to
fix prices? Is it worth risking 10,000 American lives for the emir
of Kuwait, who owns nearly as many wives as Imelda Marcos has
shoes? Should U.S. soldiers be deployed in support of the
anti-democratic Saudi regime which tortures its own people?
   Amid all the talk about Saddam Hussein's ``naked aggression''
and ``trampling of international law,'' media pundits have rarely
uttered the ``p'' word: ``Panama.'' Bush's invasion violated
international law just as much as Saddam's invasion, but one would
never know that from the U.S. media.

   I think we've been having a difficult time in reaching the
public with the longevity of this commitment. We haven't been too
careful about explaining what seems to be a long period of
continued Western presence in a fairly hostile environment. If
there is anything remiss, it may be that.
   I don't think (criticism of excess coverage of Saddam) is
founded. It is imperative to know thine enemy, if you want to put
it on a strictly partisan basis. It's a matter of degree _ there
comes a time when the seventh interview of Saddam Hussein becomes
suspect.
   We are now trying to figure out `how did we get there?' There
has been some exposition of the roots of this thing, the historical
problems that beset Kuwait and its relations to Iraq. We haven't
looked into this as much as we should. ...
   The hostages invariably take over the news and they become what
I imagine what Saddam Hussein wants them to become, one of the
primary issues. The administration has been forced to do its utmost
to downplay the hostages.

<HEAD>Woods Hole Celebrates 60 Years of Ocean Exploration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WOODS HOLE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning in 1930, with $3 million from
the Rockefeller Foundation and a small ship called Atlantis,
scientists began exploring the ocean from this tiny seaport at one
corner of Cape Cod.
   Since then, oceanographers from Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution have discovered vast underwater mountain ranges,
strange life forms in the Galapagos Islands, hot water springs
miles beneath the ocean surface and even the RMS Titanic.
   Even the movie ``Jaws'' featured Richard Dreyfuss as a scientist
from Woods Hole called in for his expertise on the great white
shark.
   Indeed, after 60 years of exhaustive research, experimentation
and technology, scientists at Woods Hole can say this with pride:
Men have now seen 1 percent of the ocean floor.
   One percent? This from a nation that sent men to the moon two
decades ago? Scientists at Woods Hole will tell you that time and
money would be better spent here.
   ``It's much more important that we use the tremendous technology
we have to understand ourselves,'' said John Steele, a senior
scientist at Woods Hole and former director of the institution.
``We have major scientific problems as well as social concerns here
on Earth.''
   The success of the scientists at Woods Hole is remarkable given
the lack of glamour attached to oceanography and the scarcity of
funds available for research.
   The government spends about $390 million in oceanographic
research annually. In contrast, President Bush proposed this year a
$15.2 billion space agency budget.
   ``Perhaps we aren't as good at selling ourselves as NASA,'' said
Steele. ``But we also all had, even scientists, the mistaken belief
that the bottom of the ocean was flat and uninteresting.
   ``Without the capabilities of Woods Hole and other institutions,
we wouldn't understand the Gulf Stream and why it's important to
problems of climate. We wouldn't have made wonderful discoveries
under the sea bed and we wouldn't have appreciated the marine life
in the deep ocean.''
   It can be as tricky to send scientists down to the ocean's
average depth of 12,000 feet as it is to send astronauts into
space. The incredible pressure and the absence of light make the
construction of underwater vehicles and other technology laborious
and expensive.
   But the marine biologists, geologists, engineers, divers,
technicians, chemists, physicists and many others who comprise the
900 employees at Woods Hole believe many of the solutions to the
world's environmental crisis may lie beneath the ocean surface.
   Woods Hole is the largest private oceanographic institute in the
world and relies mostly on grants, about 80 percent of them from
the federal government. Unlike its West Coast counterpart, the
state university-affiliated Scripps Institute in La Jolla, Calif.,
Woods Hole does not receive state money. It has an operating budget
of $67 million a year.
   As a result, Woods Hole scientists have been likened to
entrepreneurs, each in charge of their own destiny and relying on
their creativity and vision to come up with successful grant
proposals.
   Among the 350 projects at Woods Hole, one of the most eagerly
anticipated is the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, a global
study of sea patterns. The 10-year, $100 million project will track
how the ocean influences climate over periods longer than weather
forecasts of a few weeks.
   Scientists from the Soviet Union, China, Brazil, Britain,
France, Spain and Australia, among others, are part of the project.
They began gathering at Woods Hole more than three years ago to map
the project.
   ``The ocean plays a significant role in determining the impact
of the greenhouse effect,'' said Terrence Joyce, a senior scientist
at Woods Hole who is directing the hydrographic program for the
World Ocean Circulation Experiment. ``WOCE will give us an idea of
how the ocean affects climate change and allow us to better predict
the future.''
   Woods Hole, or WHOI (pronounced ``Hooey'' by local residents and
employees), has been on the cutting edge of oceanography and marine
science since its inception. It was founded following a
recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences that an American
oceanographic lab was needed on the East Coast.
   The sprawling ``campus'' of Woods Hole dominates the small town,
which extends like a little finger off the southwestern corner of
Cape Cod. The large brick buildings of Woods Hole line the
village's main street, with water on both sides.
   The campus consists of four large laboratories and a variety of
smaller buildings in the village of Woods Hole and on the nearby
200-acre Quissett campus. The institution offers a graduate degree
program for future oceanographers with the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
   Work at sea is conducted aboard three large research vessels, a
smaller coastal vessel and the Alvin, a three-person, deep-water
submersible.
   During World War II, Woods Hole researchers developed
anti-fouling paint, which prevented barnacles from forming on the
hulls of boats, and the bathythermograph, an instrument that gives
a record of temperature layers in the ocean.
   Since 1964, scientists at Woods Hole have been able to penetrate
the ocean frontier with the aid of Alvin, which has made more than
2,000 dives all over the world and can go as deep as 13,000 feet.
   Alvin's most dramatic early mission was reminiscent of the film
``Dr. Strangelove.'' In 1966, two military planes collided over
Spain and a hydrogen bomb fell into the Mediterranean. Alvin pilots
found the device and then relocated it after it slipped down a
steep slope during a recovery attempt.
   In 1974, Alvin joined Project FAMOUS, a French-American undersea
study and collected the first-ever photographs and samples of the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
   Woods Hole has a celebrity scientist, Robert Ballard, who
discovered the wreck of the Titanic in 1985. Ballard discovered the
German battleship Bismarck last year. He also is host of the PBS's
National Geographic ``Explorer'' TV series.
   ``Woods Hole tends to support high-risk people more than a
public institution would,'' said Ballard. ``It's very comparable to
private industry versus the government. There's a greater risk if
you fail, but it lets you try.''

<HEAD>Salmonella Outbreak in Raw Tomatoes Hard to Trace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of salmonella in raw tomatoes in the
Midwest points up the need to take precautions to clean all food
properly.
   In the last two months, more than 100 people have been reported
stricken with salmonella javiana in Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin
and Michigan.
   It was the numbers that got officials' attention. Normally in
Illinois, for example, officials would expect 20 cases of this
strain of salmonella among 2,000 to 3,000 cases of salmonella a
year.
   The exact source of the tomato contamination has yet to be
solved, but it appears the problem stemmed from one distributor,
said Minnesota state epidemiologist Mike Osterholm. The
contamination, he said, could have occurred anywhere from the
fields to the trucking operation.
   ``We have no evidence of anything intentional happening or of
any breaks in good harvesting practices,'' he said. ``And it
occurred at a time when millions of tomatoes were coming into the
Midwest. We really are looking at a needle in a haystack.''
   Osterholm estimated that thousands of people were made ill by
the contaminated tomatoes. Only a small percentage of cases of such
outbreaks generally get reported to state authorities, he said.
   Though people commonly think of salmonella in relation to animal
products, strains of it have turned up and caused large outbreaks
traced to lettuce and parsley, cantalopes and other plant foods.
   The symptoms _ vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps _ are the
same for salmonella javiana and the better-known salmonella
enteritidis, said Dr. David Swerdlow, a medical epidemiologist with
the Centers for Disease Control.
   ``There are hundreds of salmonella strains. Some are more common
than others, but most cause similar disease,'' he said. ``Javiana
is fairly rare, so when there was increase in these states,
everybody took notice.''
   Recent outbreaks of food poisoning, Osterholm said, are a result
of changes in food distribution _ large quantities of food moving
over a widespread area.
   ``I have great concern about the safety of the food suyppy
today,'' he said. ``It is a lot less safe today than 10 to 15 years
ago.''
   Some precautions that can be taken at home:
   _ Wash fruit and vegetables. ``I think it was impressive to us
how few people knew'' they should wash produce, Osterholm said.
   _ For tomatoes and other fruit, cut off the stem area and then
cut out any bruises or bad spots. Wash the knife between each cut
to prevent any bacteria from spreading into the tomato flesh. The
salmonella outbreak traced to cantalopes occurred because the
bacteria on the rind was carried by knives to the fruit.
   _ After the fruit has been cut, don't leave it for long at room
temperature.
   _ Thoroughly wash any cutting boards used for meat before
putting produce on them. Better yet, use separate boards.

   Sales of North American-made cars and light

   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
Wednesday they sold an average of 32,046 cars and trucks a day

   It began in a renovated elevator factory where
customers were drawn by dishes and utensils stacked devil-may-care
in the crates and barrels they came in.
   That rustic presentation gave the first Crate&amp;Barrel store a
formula for success: Showing off mundane household products with
the flair and imagination many stores reserve for designer garments.
   The notion has brought the company from that single store in
1962 to more than 30 in six states, with a new flagship showroom to
open Thursday on Chicago's glitzy Magnificent Mile.
   ``Crate&amp;Barrel does for its housewares what most apparel stores
do for their clothing lines. They dress up their products so that a
customer can look at a set of tableware and envision what their
table at home could look like _ just like they would with an outfit
of clothing,'' said George Rosenbaum, president of the retail
research firm Leo J. Shapiro &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   The flagship store is another expression of Crate&amp;Barrel's
trademark showmanship, offering display cases with dressers and
chairs along Chicago's ritziest retail strip.
   It all began when Gordon and Carole Segal, then both 23, were
washing the dishes one day in 1962.
   Mr. Segal wondered why he couldn't get the couple's favorite
dishware in Chicago, and they decided there was a gap in the local
market.
   They quit their jobs _ his in real estate, hers in teaching _
raised $17,000 and set out to fill the gap with the first
Crate&amp;Barrel.
   ``It was all created out of a desire to be different,'' said Mr.
Segal, president and owner of the store chain.
   It operates under the corporate name Euromarket Designs Inc.,
based in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook. Mrs. Segal pulled away
to start her own catering business and has since retired.
   When they started, the usual places to stock one's kitchen and
dining room were department stores, where the goods often were
warehoused in unobtrusive places, Mr. Segal said.
   ``It was really a dreadful part of the store,'' he said. ``It
was always hidden away on the top floor.''
   Retail analysts and experts say Crate&amp;Barrel brought a new
strategy to the housewares business by giving as much attention to
the overall look of the store as to the types of goods it sells.
   ``Crate&amp;Barrel has always been considered innovative in terms of
color and style of their housewares, and especially in the way they
display them,'' said Kimberly Rawn, spokeswoman for the
Chicago-based National Housewares Manufacturers Association.
   Mr. Segal describes his company as a ``blend of artists and
businessmen.''
   ``It's a fine line,'' he said. ``We don't want to be an art
gallery, but at the same time we don't want to just look at the
bottom line.''
   The privately owned company declines to release details of its
finances or operations, except to say its staff has grown from
three to about 1,000 employees.
   It has reported sales of about $15 million from its catalog
business alone, and Mr. Segal said it taps the lucrative wedding
market with a bridal registry listing an average 18,000 brides at
any given time.
   Crate&amp;Barrel stores are found in Illinois, California, Texas,
Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington, D.C.
   About 75 percent of the housewares sold in the stores are
imported, and the stores' purchasers aren't bound by the consumer
preference studies many department stores rely on, Mr. Segal said.
   ``If we don't like it, if we think it's ugly, we're not going to
buy it,'' he said. ``Just because Bloomingdale's sold 2,000 of
these lamps doesn't mean we're going to rush to sell them, too.''
   He acknowledges not having stockholders allows him more freedom
to veer from the norm and take risks instead of relying on market
tests.
   ``He's not under pressure to increase business or cut corners in
order to keep earnings up,'' Rosenbaum said. ``So he has the luxury
of moving slowly and trying new things.''

<HEAD>T. Boone Pickens Heats Up Rhetoric Against Koito, Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens turns up the
rhetoric in his personal trade war with Japan's Koito Manufacturing
Co. today with full-page advertisements in New York and Washington.
   Pickens lambastes trade policies in Japan, which he said ``is
even refusing to fully support America's military efforts in the
Middle East. . . .''
   Pickens, known for his often hostile raids on U.S. companies,
has been battling with the management of Koito for 18 months to
gain representation on its board of directors.
   Pickens claims his battle with Koito, an automobile parts
manufacturer, is an example of Japan's closed corporate system,
which the ads claim is unfair to competition.
   The ads, slated to appear in The New York Times and the
Washington Post, said: ``The Japanese refuse to play on a level
playing field, causing the loss of American jobs and a growing U.S.
trade imbalance. Now Japan is even refusing to fully support
America's military efforts in the Middle East where Japan gets all
of its oil to fuel its economic machine.''
   Koito issued a statement that branded Pickens' tactics
``outrageous and irresponsible.''
   Pickens has maintained that Koito is really a subsidiary in an
alleged cartel headed by Toyota Motor Corp., the Japanese carmaker,
which is Koito's largest customer. Pickens, whose Boone Co. owns 26
percent of Koito's stock, claims Toyota has three seats on the
Koito board while controlling only 19 percent of the car parts
maker's stock.
   But Ruth Pachman, a Koito spokeswoman in New York, said Toyota
has no representatives on the board, although three former Toyota
employees are board members.
   Koito, in turn, has maintained Pickens is really fronting for a
Japanese investor, Kitaro Wantanabe, who is allegedly seeking to
mount a ``greenmail'' campaign, in which a corporate raider buys a
company's stock, forcing it to buy the shares back at above-market
prices.
   Pickens has denied the allegation but also refuses to disclose
the source of his financing to obtain his stake in Koito.
   The Texan was again denied a seat on Koito's board at a raucous
company's shareholders' March meeting in Tokyo.
   Koito said Pickens was ``trying to manipulate public opinion for
his own personal gain. He continues to wrap his greenmailing
schemes in the mantle of U.S.-Japan trade relations. These tactics
are outrageous and irresponsible.''
   Japan, which consumes 4.9 millions barrels of oil per day _ 3.4
million barrels of it from the Persian Gulf _ has pledged $1
billion in aid for the multi-national force opposing Iraqi troops
that invaded Kuwait last month.
   But Kuwait and the United States have urged Japan to do more.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has ruled out any direct role for
Japan's military, citing the constitutional ban against using force
in settling international disputes.
   A Japanese foreign ministry spokesman said Wednesday that
corporations there will be asked to divert exisiting stock to the
aid package and sell their products to the government at cost.
   Mark Helmke, a Pickens spokesman in Washington said the ads,
which urge readers to complain to the White House, Congress and the
Japanese embassy about Japanese trade policies, will run in other
newspapers around the country at a later date.

<HEAD>Late-August Sales Skid Against Strong Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of North American-made cars and trucks
skidded 21 percent in late August compared with a strong period
last year when customers were lured by attractive incentives.
   Automakers said they saw no signs that spiraling gasoline prices
had sent consumers to more fuel-efficient cars.
   The 10 major car and truck makers in the United States said
Wednesday they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 38,943
during the Aug. 21-31 period this year. That compared with a 49,276
vehicle-a-day rate during the same time last year, when incentives
lured buyers to showrooms.
   Car sales during the Aug. 21-31 period dropped 18.8 percent and
truck sales were off 24.9 percent.
   Sales of cars made by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler Corp. were down 27 percent during the period while sales
of cars made by Japanese companies in North America rose 26.5
percent.
   ``Thus far, consumers seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude
and the automobile market has been much more stable than might have
been expected under the circumstances,'' Ford's North American
sales executive Robert Rewey said of effects of Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``With few exceptions, these numbers are terrible,'' said Tom
Webb, a senior economist with the National Automobile Dealers
Association in McLean, Va. ``Sales typically spurt ahead in the
final 10-day period. There was no oomph at the end of August.''
   For the entire month, with import sales included, combined car
and truck sales in the United States fell 17 percent from last
August. Car sales were down 17.6 percent and truck sales fell 15.7
percent.
   Webb, Rewey, Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakowboski and GM marketing
Vice President J.B. Fitzpatrick agreed that a general softening of
the economy was more of a reason for the declining vehicle sales
rate.
   ``While present business conditions have created some
uncertainty in the marketplace, we are optimistic that the
environment will continue to stabilize in the weeks ahead,''
Fitzpatrick said.
   Through the first eight months of this year, car and truck sales
from domestic and overseas automakers were 6 percent behind last
year's pace. Car sales were down 6.4 percent and truck sales were
off 5 percent.
   Sales of domestic cars for the year were down 5.9 percent and
import car sales were off 7.8 percent. Sales of trucks made in
North America were down 2.7 percent and import truck sales were
down 18.5 percent.
   Ford's car and truck sales rate dropped 28.7 percent in late
August compared with a year ago. For the year, Ford's combined car
and truck sales were 9.3 percent behind last year's pace.
   Chrysler said its combined car and truck sales for late August
were 31 percent lower than last year, and down 14.9 percent for the
first eight months of the year.
   GM said its late-August vehicle sales rate fell 22.5 percent.
Through August of this year, the automaker's combined car and truck
sales were running 4.7 percent behind last year.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for third period of August 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were 10 selling days in the period this year and 10 selling
days last year.
   For the month, there were 27 selling days this year and 27
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 206 selling days
this year and 205 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant cars.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, on
a globe-trotting search for billions of dollars to support the
campaign against Iraq's Saddam Hussein, arrived in Asia today for
what promises to be the toughest selling job of the whole trip.
   Brady is scheduled to meet Friday with South Korean President
Roh Tae-woo. Later the same day, he flies to Tokyo for talks with
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   The Bush administration also dispatched Secretary of State James
A. Baker III to oil-rich nations of the Middle East to look for
economic support.
   Officials in the delegation traveling with Brady said the stops
in South Korea and Japan were likely to be the most difficult, in
part because Americans were looking for substantial contributions
from both countries to defray the cost of the U.S. military buildup
and to help ease the economic hardships on Jordan and other nations
resulting from the trade embargo on Iraq.
   Critics in the United States have complained that both Japan and
South Korea should be doing more, given the fact that their
economies are heavily dependent on oil from the Middle East.
   A working dinner at the U.S. ambassador's residence was the only
event on Brady's schedule before his meeting Friday morning with
the South Korean president.
   These discussions were to follow on the heels of Brady's talks
Tuesday and Wednesday with French officials and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   But in those cases, the meetings involved countries which
already have a sizable military presence in the Persian Gulf and
have indicated a willingness to provide at least some aid to
alleviate the economic suffering on Egypt, Jordan and Turkey from
enforcement of the trade embargo against Iraq.
   Japan and South Korea have been less forthcoming in the eyes of
the administration, and for that reason Brady's delegation was
braced for tougher negotiations.
   During Brady's 17-hour flight from Europe to the Far East,
senior administration officials said a $1 billion military support
package offered by Japan represented a good first step. But they
left the clear impression that Tokyo would be called on to do more.
   The officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said there was no thought of asking South Korea to supply military
troops in the Middle East. But they suggested Seoul would be asked
to make in-kind contributions to support the American buildup.
   The administration officials also supplied some of the first
specific figures on what President Bush had in mind when he called
on America's allies to pay their fair share of the economic and
military campaign being waged to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   The officials said the United States is looking for its allies
to pick up the entire cost of the American military buildup in the
Persian Gulf, which they estimated would cost $1 billion a month
over the next year.
   ``I think it is not unreasonable to ask the allies to pick up
all of it,'' one official said. ``After all, they couldn't buy this
(military) capability anywhere else in the world.''
   Japan's $1 billion has been earmarked to support the military
exercise in such ways as sending medical personnel to the gulf.
   The officials indicated that this type of in-kind contributions
of such things as oil, transportation and housing would be the
preferred donation rather than direct cash, which raises questions
among critics over whether the U.S. military is fielding a
mercenary force in the Mideast.
   Secretary of State Baker, meanwhile, flew to the Middle East
overnight in his search for economic support. The administration is
hoping to get significant amounts from Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and the exiled government of Kuwait, which still has
significant financial resources at its disposal.
   In addition to looking for support for the U.S. military effort,
Brady and Baker were searching for a $10.5 billion pool of
resources to assist Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, three countries
severely hurt by the trade embargo against Iraq.
   Senior officials traveling on Brady's plane put the relief need
for the three countries at $3.5 billion for the last three months
of this year and $7 billion more next year.
   In his meetings in Europe, Brady has stressed how critical it is
for the allies to put together an economic assistance package to
insure that the embargo against Iraq doesn't begin to unravel.
   The conversations with Mrs. Thatcher and the French centered
primarily on this issue of support for so-called frontline states
in the Mideast.
   In addition to this aid, the administration wants to raise an
unspecified amount to be used to alleviate adverse economic effects
from rising oil prices on countries such as the Philippines, Brazil
and the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
   The officials would not discuss an overall price tag, but the
various elements could well add up to more than $25 billion.

<HEAD>Soybean Trader Pleads Guilty to Fraud Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another soybean trader at the Chicago Board of
Trade has pleaded guilty to charges stemming from an FBI probe of
alleged corruption at the world's two largest commodities exchanges.
   The guilty plea Wednesday by Bruce Mittelstadt of Elmhurst was
the eighth from a soybean trader charged in the FBI sting operation.
   Mittelstadt pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge George
Marovich to one count of mail fraud and one count of violating the
Commodities Exchange Act, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Gillogly.
   Federal prosecutors will drop the remainder of the 57 charges
filed against Mittelstadt in exchange for his cooperation, Gillogly
said.
   In all, 48 people have been indicted in the probe. FBI agents
posed as traders and secretly tape recorded conversations that
prosecutors said revealed fraud among traders at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A sentencing date was not set for Mittelstadt, but Gillogly said
the trader could face a maximum sentence of six years in prison and
a $350,000 fine. Mittelstadt's attorneys did not return telephone
calls to their offices late Wednesday.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, jury selection for the trial of 14 Japanese
yen futures traders charged in the probe began Wednesday in U.S.
District Court in Chicago. Those defendants face 393 counts of
illegal trading practices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>Report Says Milken Prosecutors Hope to Press Full Case at
Sentencing Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors will attempt to bring their full
case against Michael Milken before a federal judge next month when
the former junk bond pioneer is sentenced for his guilty pleas on
unlawful trading charges, a newspaper report said today.
   The Wall Street Journal said the government plans to urge U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood to consider additional allegations
against Milken when she sentences him. Sentencing is set for Oct. 1.
   Milken, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk
bond department, and the government reached a plea bargain in April
under which Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to
unlawful trading.
   But the government didn't agree to recommend any specific
sentence.
   The newspaper story said the government hopes that evidence of
additional crimes _ presented in a sentencing memo and in live
testimony _ will induce Judge Wood to give Milken a stiff sentence
for the crimes to which he has pleaded guilty. Milken faces a
maximum sentence on those charges of 28 years.
   The report said the witnesses could include Ivan Boesky, the
convicted former stock trader.
   The story said the judge isn't obligated to take the
government's additional allegations into consideration when
deciding an appropriate sentence. But if she does, the story said
Milken will be entitled to defend himself at a hearing.
   The story said prosecutors have held lengthy discussions with
attorneys for Milken in recent months detailing what they plan to
say in their sentencing memo to the judge, who is scheduled to
receive it on Monday.
   In addition, the story said witnesses who aided the government
in its case against Milken have confirmed that they were told by
prosecutors that the government will seek to present the full force
of its case against Milken at any such hearing.
   Prosecutors have told these attorneys that such a hearing could
last for more than three months, the story said.

<TEXT>
   Bertelsmann AG, the West German media
conglomerate, has ended an eight-month search for a new boss of
Bantam Doubleday Dell on by naming Paul D. Neuthaler as chairman
and chief executive.
   The publishing group had been without a permanent leader since
Alberto Vitale left to take over Random House at the start of the
year.
   Officials of the parent company said Wednesday that the search
was prolonged by the difficulty of finding an executive with
credentials in both books and finance, the New York Times reported
Thursday.
   The choice of Neuthaler, a relative unknown, appeared to be
connected with Bertelsmann's desire to push into scientific,
technical and professional publishing in the United States.
   Neuthaler, 47, had directed a fruitless effort by the company in
the middle 1980s to develop a technical publishing arm in this
country.
   He then left to become a partner of JPT Publishing Group,
financial, scientific and market research publishers.
   Bantam Doubleday Dell is a general-interest, or trade,
publishing group for which Bertelsmann paid $475 million three
years ago.
   Bernhard von Minckwitz, a Bertelsmann board member who had been
acting chief executive during the search for a new chairman, will
remain with the group with the new title of executive chairman and
Neuthaler will report to him, Bertelsmann said.

   Mail bombs exploded at the Madrid Stock
Exchange, the Economy Ministry and the Constitutional Court today,
slightly injuring six people, police said. A shadowy leftist group
claimed responsibility.
   In France, the Paris Stock Exchange was evacuated in mid-session
today after a bomb threat, officials at the exchange said. Police
conducted a 20-minute search of the building, then lifted the bomb
alert and allowed employees to return.
   No details were released about the Paris threat, which came
shortly after the Madrid blasts.
   The first two explosions in Madrid came at about 11:30 a.m.
local time off the exchange's trading floor and on the 11th floor
of the Economy Ministry, a police spokesman said.
   Minutes later, the third bomb exploded at the Constitutional
Court on Madrid's western edge, Spanish National Radio reported.
   The six injured, all at the stock exchange, were treated for
cuts and bruises at a hospital and later released. No one was
injured at the Economy Ministry or the court, police and the
national radio said.
   Callers claiming to represent the far-left group GRAPO warned
Madrid municipal police and Economy Ministry officials minutes
before the blasts, the police said. Earlier, police had said the
attacks bore the hallmark of the Basque separatist group ETA.
   Witnesses told police they saw women carrying suspicious-looking
packages entering the Madrid buildings just before the explosions,
police said. Women have taken part in several GRAPO-claimed
killings and bombings.
   All three buildings were evacuated and police bomb squads
searched for other bombs. The stock market and ministry are located
blocks apart on Castellana Boulevard, Madrid's main north-south
thoroughfare.
   The national radio's stock market reporter Juan Antonio Polo
said the explosion at the exchange caused part of the ground floor
ceiling to collapse and sent people rushing from the building.
   The blast occurred near an elevator off the trading floor and
shattered many windows, Polo said.
   GRAPO, a shadowy Maoist organization, has claimed responsibility
for 30 killings since it surfaced in 1975. The last attack for
which GRAPO claimed responsibility was June 15, when two gunmen
shot to death an Army colonel outside his house in the northern
city of Valladolid.
   GRAPO takes its name from the Spanish initials for the First of
October Anti-Fascist Revolutionary Group, an organization that
began its violent attacks on that date in 1975 with the murder of
four Madrid policemen.

   A federal judge today denied the
government's request for a stay of his order requiring the Office
of Thrift Supervision to return control of Franklin Savings
Association to its former officers.
   The denial by Judge Dale E. Saffels sent government attorneys to
the 10th U.S. Circuit Court in Denver seeking to override Saffels
and get an order that would keep Franklin under federal management.
   The government was fighting a deadline Saffels set Wednesday for
turning Franklin over to its former managers.
   Franklin's chief counsel, Roger Stanton, said the savings
association had its attorneys ready in Denver to file a response
opposing a similar motion there. He said 10th Circuit rules do not
provide for a hearing on such a motion.
   OTS seized control of Franklin, based in Ottawa, Kan., and the
state's largest thrift, last February in a dispute over whether it
was being managed prudently. It placed Franklin under management of
the Resolution Trust Corp. as conservator.
   Franklin's officers sued to regain control of the thrift, and
Saffels held in a 93-page opinion made public Wednesday that the
government seizure was arbitrary and capricious.
   He ordered the government to remove the RTC as conservator of
Franklin and to turn over management reins today to the thrift's
chairman, Ernest W. Fleischer.
   However, OTS attorneys filed a motion Wednesday night for a stay
of judgment, seeking to keep Franklin in the hands of the RTC while
the government appeals Saffels' decision.
   Saffels said the OTS ``has not demonstrated either a strong
likelihood of success on the merits on appeal, or that it would
suffer irreparable harm if a stay were not issued.''
   The judge, ruling on the stay motion without a hearing, said a
stay would be ``contrary to the public interest.''
   Harris Weinstein, chief OTS counsel in Washington, said late
Wednesday the federal agency would appeal to the 10th Circuit
seeking a stay if Saffels denied its motion.
   In his order, Saffels found that the OTS decision to take
control of Franklin ``lacked any basis in fact.''
   Weinstein disagreed strongly.
   ``We firmly believe the government acted in a timely and proper
manner in taking over Franklin, an institution that was being
operated with insufficient capital and in an unsafe and unsound
manner,'' Weinstein said in a statement issued in Washington.
   ``OTS continues to believe that prior to the conservatorship
order, Franklin was placing excessive reliance on high-risk assets
financed by high-cost and mobile brokered deposits, and that at the
same time Franklin used improper accounting methods under which it
recognized gains and deferred losses while distributing more than
$45 million of the institution's funds in dividends to the
shareholders.''
   Saffels also retained jurisdiction in the case for the next 90
days, meaning that the OTS cannot appoint another conservator or
attempt to place Franklin in receivership during that time without
his approval.
   Saffels told reporters that after 90 days, the OTS could move
against Franklin again. That could mean more court hearings, he
said, ``and we'd probably start over again.''
   The ruling was not expected to have any direct impact on other
savings and loan litigation.
   At issue in this case was whether OTS was justified in seizing
control of the $11 billion thrift on Feb. 16 for allegedly losing
millions in the futures market but deferring those losses for
bookkeeping purposes by using a controversial hedging accounting
system.
   Franklin officials, headed by Fleischer, sued the government on
March 12, contending the government had insufficient evidence of
losses, management problems or improper accounting procedures to
take over the thrift.
   Saffels declared in his lengthy opinion that ``no statutory
ground for the imposition of a conservatorship existed.''
   ``This was not a case of improper or retroactive rule-making,
but one of erroneous application of existing regulatory rules,'' he
wrote. ``The facts of this case clearly show that the regulator
acted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship. This court must
correct that wrongful action.''
   The judge went out of his way to distinguish the Franklin case
from others being prosecuted around the country by OTS.
   ``This is not a case involving an infamous or notorious savings
and loan association, the likes of which the public has recently
become more than familiar,'' Saffels wrote.
   ``This is not a case involving fraud, corruption or self-dealing
by the management or directors of Franklin. There has been no
allegation or even hint of illegal or unethical conduct by
Franklin's management or directors.
   ``Essentially, this case boils down to a dispute over accounting
practices,'' he wrote.
   Fleischer, who was in Saffels' courtroom when the ruling was
released, said he was ``very pleased with the decision and the care
with which the decision was written.''

   Crude oil futures prices soared above $30 a
barrel in early trading today on continued fears of supply
disruptions because of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The price of the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil was up $1.17
at $30.94 per 42-gallon a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Light, sweet crude for October delivery rose 65 cents to
$29.77 per barrel on Wednesday.
   Traders said today's sharp rise extended Wednesday's gains,
which came on harsh talk by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
fears of shortages and signs of hoarding by U.S. consumers and
distributors.
   Also, news overnight that an American had been shot by an Iraqi
soldier trying to avoid capture increased fears of war in the
region. The American later was reported in a hospital after he was
shot in the hand.
   Oil prices have shot up since Iraq occupied Kuwait Aug. 2 on
fears that the world's supply could be sharply reduced by fighting
in the Middle East.
   Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst for E. D. &amp; F. Man
International Futures Inc., said traders are anticipating
disruptions in oil supplies in the next couple weeks, as well as
shortages as demand increases in the winter.
   Refined products traded on the Merc also shot up this morning.
   Home heating oil for October delivery was up 3.83 cents to 87.20
cents per gallon, after rising 0.98 cent on Wednesday. Unleaded
gasoline was 2.98 cents higher to 95.25 cents per gallon, erasing
Wednesday's drop of 2.25 cents.

   The stock market headed lower today in another

   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 415 up, 811

   Volume on the Big Board came to 42.21 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said buyers were holding back awaiting the Labor
Department's report Friday morning on the employment situation for

economy.
   Speculation has begun to spread on Wall Street that the data
might encourage the Federal Reserve to adopt a more stimulative
credit policy in an effort to ease strains on the economy and the
banking system.
   But Wall Streeters are not entirely convinced that long-term
interest rates would automatically fall in response to such a move.
   In fact, some say, rates could rise in that setting if fears
increased that the Fed was softening its stand against inflation.
That, in turn, would stand to leave the central bank in an even
worse policy bind than it faces now.

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Exxon Corp. has
made a new oil and gas discovery in a Malaysian offshore field, its
exploration manager said Thursday.
   In production tests, oil flowed at more than 3,000 barrels a
day, Dennis Francis, exploration manager of Esso Production
Malaysia Ltd., said.
   Francis said the discovery was made from a well begun on July 5
in the Larut Field, in the South China Sea about 150 miles from the
Malaysian town of Kuala Trengganu.
   The well is in a production-sharing contract block in which Esso
is the operator and 50 percent equity holder, together with
Petronas Carigali, a subsidiary of Petronas, the government-owned
National Petroleum Corp.
   Francis said the results were encouraging, but plans to develop
the Larut Field would depend on results from follow-up wells.
   Esso now produces 335,000 barrels of oil a day in Malaysia, up
5,000 since Malaysia increased its overall production to help meet
oil requests from other countries amid the crisis resulting from
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Malaysia now produces 605,000 barrels a day, consumes 75,000
barrels a day, and exports the rest to Japan, South Korea,
Thailand, the Philippines, India and other countries.

<HEAD>Mexico Maintains Increased Crude Oil Exports For Three More Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico announced it will continue exporting
100,000 barrels of crude oil more than normal every day until the
end of this year to take advantage of rising world market prices
caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   A news release by the state petroleum monopoly Petroleos
Mexicanos S.A. _ popularly known by its Spanish acronym of Pemex _
said Wednesday the increased exports will not diminish liquid fuel
supplies for domestic consumption.
   When the gulf crisis began with with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
Aug. 2, Pemex raised the volume of its exports by 100,000 barrels a
day for August and September to help stabilize the market. It said
at the time it could not go beyond that because it was behind in
the development of its oilfields.
   But in Wednesday's news release, Pemex said it ``was able to
increase its operating margins ... without sacrificing any domestic
supplies, permitting it to take advantage of rising prices in the
international market.''
   Pemex exported an average of 1.2 million barrels a day in July,
and an average of 1.3 million barrels daily in August.
   About half of Mexico's crude exports go to the United States.

<TEXT>
   Brazil paid its creditors $3.7 billion
in the first quarter but the country's foreign debt rose by $2.2
billion, the Central Bank said Thursday.
   The Brazilian debt rose to $116.9 billion in March from $114.7
in December 1989, according to a quarterly report from the bank.
   The report said Brazil's short-term debt rose to $19.5 billion,
or 23.4 percent of the total. The medium- and long-term debt
dropped slightly to $97.4 billion.
   Preliminary figures showed Brazil paid its creditors $3.7
billion between January and March.
   Brazil has the largest foreign debt in the developing world.
   The government stopped interest payments to private creditors in
mid-1989 but has continued to pay the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank and the Interamerican Development Bank.
   Arrears are estimated at $6 billion to commercial banks and $2
billion to government lenders of the so-called Paris Club.

<TEXT>
   An investment arm of the Rockefeller family
is joining Banco Hispano Americano of Spain and Britain's Dillon
Read Ltd. to form a $60 million company to invest in Spanish
stocks, spokesmen for Dillon Read and the bank said Thursday.
   Rockefeller and Co. Inc. plans to take a 30 percent stake in the
new company with another undisclosed non-Spanish investor, said the
spokesmen, who asked not to be identified.
   Hispano Americano will take a 50 percent share along with two
Spanish companies, while Dillon Read is to share a 20 percent stake
with an undisclosed non-Spanish partner.
   The Dillon Read spokesman said the as-yet unnamed investment
company plans to make three-to-five-year investments in Spanish
companies seen as undervalued.
   He said the company is to begin operations in the next few weeks
and eventually would be listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange.
   The bank spokesman confirmed a report published Thursday in the
business daily Expansion that said Hispano Americano will share its
stake with construction company Ferrovial SA and Seville-based
Abengoa SA, an engineering and electrical equipment maker.
   Ferrovial owns a large stake in Banco Hispano Americano, one of
Spain's six major private banks and an experienced manager of
foreign funds invested in Spain.
   Stock prices have dropped about 20 percent on the Madrid Stock
Exchange since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait roiled world
stock markets.
   But the Dillon Read spokesman said the drop ihas created ``an
opportune moment to start making investments'' because there was no
longer concern about dealing with ``an overheated market.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly

<HEAD>Airline Survey Reveals Travelers' Chief Gripe: Delays</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frequent fliers want to get where they're going
cheaply and on time. Nothing bugs them like delays. And in general
they're pretty unhappy with airline service.
   So says the 1990 Zagat Airline Survey, which reflects the
opinions of 4,462 upscale business travelers who spend nearly one
night a week on the road. Results were released at a New York news
conference Thursday.
   ``Many view the airlines and airports as akin to the buses and
bus terminals of 20 years ago: deteriorating, overcrowded,
disappearing and depressing,'' said survey analyst Nicholas
Tortorello.
   The survey was a first for Tim and Nina Zagat, the husband and
wife team known for their annual assessment of hotels and
restaurants. They said they took on the airline industry ``to
explore the public's feelings'' about air travel.
   Questionnaires were sent to 25,000 people this spring asking
them to rate 1,400 U.S. hotels, restaurants, spas, car rental
companies and airlines.
   Respondents were asked to rate 27 top international and domestic
carriers in terms of comfort, service, timeliness, food and ``bang
for buck,'' which rated cost and value. Scores were then averaged
together for an overall rating.
   The top 10 spots went to international carriers, with Singapore
Airlines heading the list with an overall rating of 25.14, followed
by Swissair, Japan Air lines, Scandinavian Airlines System and
Qantas.
   American Airlines ranked 11th with an 18.62 rating. Delta Air
Lines, the next domestic airline on the list, was 14th at 18.12.
   Aeroflot Soviet Airline came in last, scoring a dismal 7.31.
   According to the 30-point scale, 26 to 30 signifies a rating of
extraordinary to perfection; 20 to 25, very good to excellent; 10
to 19, good to very good; and zero to nine, poor to fair.
   Tortorello, whose firm Research &amp; Forecasts analyzed the survey
results, said foreign carriers scored better overall than domestics
because airlines use bigger, more comfortable planes on longer
flights and the crew has more time to pamper passengers.
   Domestic airlines fared better when respondents listed their
favorite airlines, capturing six of the top 10 spots. American
topped that list with 22.9 percent choosing it as their favorite.
The other top domestics were United, Delta, Trans World,
Continental and Pan American World Airways.
   The survey also separated the airlines into domestic and
international categories. American, Delta and United Airlines
respectively captured the top three domestic spots while troubled
Eastern Airlines ranked last in 11th.
   Karen Cerensak, a spokeswoman for Eastern, defended the
carrier's recent performance, saying: ``Some of these people
obviously have not flown Eastern recently. In the last 18 months,
we've been on top in the industry for on time performance. We've
received food awards for our in-flight meals and our fares are
among the lowest in the industry. So the perception that's out
there does not match reality.''
   Internationally, Singapore, Swissair and Japan Air Lines headed
the list while El Al Israel Airlines, Olympic Airways and Aeroflot
were listed at the bottom in 14th, 15th and 16th places.
   In a section that included comments, travelers generally had
good and bad things to say about each carrier _ with the exception
of Aeroflot. That airline was called ``a flying slum'' by one flyer
and included this warning from another: ``Don't do it.''
   The survey also found that of eight features travelers consider
in choosing an airline, the most important were routes offered (46
percent), price (42 percent) and timeliness and reliability (41
percent).
   Quality of food, 12 percent, was least important.
   Tortorello says he believes the low figure reflects passengers'
resignation that ``nothing can be done about the taste or selection
of the food.''
   Travelers' biggest gripe were delays (49.6 percent) followed by
comfort (16.5 percent) and service (9.5 percent).
   Surprisingly, safety was at the bottom of the list (1.6 percent)
and oft-heard complaints about baggage were cited by only 3.3
percent of the respondents.
   Tortorello said safety ranked so low because a majority of the
travelers apparently believe ``every airline is trying to do its
best.''
   He said women rated safety as a concern more often than men, and
women were also more concerned about price. ``Men basically seemed
more concerned about the plane being on time and comfort,''
Tortorello said.
   The collective profile of those who responded to the
questionnaire showed they were mostly upscale professionals between
the ages of 30 and 59 who spend an average of nearly one night a
week on the road.
   Fifty-nine percent of the respondents were men and 37 percent
women. Four percent did not identify themselves by sex.
   The margin of error could not be scientifically calculated
because the survey was not a random sampling.
   Cornish Hitchcock, of the non-profit watchdog group Aviation
Consumer Action Project, said the Zagat survey will be a useful
tool in helping consumers choose airlines and hopefully will
``serve as another goad to those (airlines) who are not doing such
a good job to improve their performance.''

<HEAD>Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait Puts Sale of Resort in Limbo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCOTTSDALE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last month has
put on hold efforts by the Resolution Trust Corp. to sell the
Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale to a branch of the Kuwait
government.
   For months the RTC, the federal agency established to oversee
the sale of failed savings and loan associations, had been
negotiating with the Kuwait Investment Office in London on the sale
of the $260 million-dollar Phoenician resort.
   ``That's all on hold until the Middle East situation clears
up,'' said Kevin Shields, RTC spokesman in Denver.
   The Kuwaiti office has the right of first refusal for purchasing
the Phoenician because it owns 45 percent of it and the Crescent,
another hotel in Phoenix.
   The RTC obtained the remaining 55 percent interest in the hotels
in 1989 when federal regulators seized the failing Lincoln Savings
&amp; Loan Association, which operated the hotels as subsidiaries.
   Lincoln was a unit of American Continental Corp. of Phoenix of
which financier Charles H. Keating Jr. was chairman. He resigned
Aug. 24.
   Selling the hotels already had been delayed because of the
litigation surrounding Keating, as well as an $18.5 million lawsuit
filed by McCarthy Western Constructors, prime contractor for the
Phoenician. McCarthy says it is owed that much for work it did at
the hotel but was not paid.
   That lawsuit was close to being settled, but Mark Nadeau, a
Phoenix attorney representing the hotels for the RTC, said the
Persian Gulf crisis complicates the situation because some Kuwaiti
money would be needed to pay for the settlement.
   After Iraq seized Kuwait, several governments, including those
of the United States, England and France, froze Kuwaiti investments
and assets in their countries to protect them from the Iraqis.
   The Kuwaiti office is one of several Kuwaiti institutions set up
to invest the massive oil profits Kuwait had earned since 1973,
when the first Arab oil embargo sent prices soaring.
   The country now is believed to have about $100 billion in
foreign assets and investments around the world, including the
Phoenix-area hotels.

   Assets of the nation's 520 money market mutual
funds fell $770 million in the latest week, the Investment Company
Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $406.55 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $679.3 million drop in the funds' assets the
previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade
group.
   Fund assets hit an all time high of $408.0 billion in the week
ended Aug. 22.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 255 general purpose funds rose $422.6 million to $143.69
billion, assets of 105 broker-dealer funds dropped $410.9 million
to $164.96 billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds fell
$781.7 million to $97.90 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.47 percent from 7.48 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.49 percent from 7.50 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
46 days, up from 45 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts was
unchanged from the previous week at 6.06 percent as of Wednesday.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.03 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.71
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.73 the
previous week. Yields were 7.85 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.87 percent; 7.92 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.94 percent;
and 8.05 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.06 percent.

   Atlantic Richfield Co. introduced its second
less-polluting gasoline Thursday, a premium unleaded it said would
burn cleaner and cost less than any competitor's.
   Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook said the fuel also will help
prove his contention that cleaner gasolines, not fuels such as
methanol or natural gas, are the best way to meet increasingly
tough smog-control laws in Southern California and other areas of
heavy air pollution.
   He said Arco would absorb the extra costs of making the new gas,
known as EC (for emission control) Premium, rather than passing
them along to dealers in higher wholesale prices. Making the gas
will cost a few cents more per gallon. ``What we'd like to think is
we'll sell more of it, making up the lower margin in increased
market share,'' Cook said.
   Arco currently has about 15 percent of the market for high-test
gas in the five Western states in which it sells gas, he said.
   The new gasoline, with an octane rating 92, will be sold only in
Southern California for the time being. It replaces Arco's old
high-test gasoline, the 91 octane Super Unleaded.
   Arco became the first oil company with a low-emission gasoline
in August 1989, when it introduced EC-1, a substitute for the
leaded regular used in old cars and trucks.
   Since then, several other companies have begun selling fuels
reformulated to evaporate less easily and burn cleaner. Many of
those gasolines, like Arco's EC-Premium, are intended for newer
cars that run on unleaded fuel. Examples include Shell SU 2000E,
Chevron Supreme Unleaded and Exxon Plus.
   Arco said tests it conducted with state and regional air-quality
officials showed the new fuel would reduce emissions by 86,000
pounds per day. Its EC-1 already has reduced vehicle air pollution
by 73 million pounds, Arco said.
   Cook said it would cost Arco about four cents a gallon more to
make the new premium. Arco had raised wholesale prices for the old
premium by ``a couple of cents a gallon'' before the Persian Gulf
crisis, and believes it can absorb the additional cost without
undue damage to profits, he said.
   The key ingredient in the gas, as in EC-1, is the octane-booster
methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. The oxygen-rich MTBE is used
to replace higher polluting octane-enhancers such as lead, benzene
or toluene.
   It's produced at Arco's Carson, Calif., refinery and by Arco's
chemical affiliate, assuring Arco a regular supply. A shortage of
MTBE, coupled with instability in energy markets, caused Chevron
recently to postpone the introduction of its reformulated gas in
Houston, Baltimore and Washington. Chevron already had begun
selling the fuel in Southern California.
   Cook said Arco's new gas contains 1.5 percent MTBE, compared to
competitors' 1 percent, while polluting components have been
reduced. For example, it contains just 1 percent benzene, compared
to 2.7 percent benzene in competitors' fuels, he said.
   Arco, the nation's eighth-largest oil company, sells gas in
California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona and Nevada. Its strategy
has been to offer the lowest pump prices, something it's
accomplished by doing away with credit cards and nearly all
full-service pumps.
   Huge reserves of Alaska crude have also helped that strategy,
and came in handy in assuring crude supply when President Bush
appealed to oil companies to restrain price increases after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Arco froze its wholesale gas prices for two weeks, longer than
any other company. The move reaped goodwill from the public and
politicians, a bonanza the company clearly hopes to augment with
its new fuels.
   That response was clear at the news conference Thursday, as Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and regional smog-control officials
praised Cook as a farsighted smog-fighter.
   No oil company has yet introduced a less-polluting substitute
for regular unleaded gasoline, by far the most commonly used grade
and also the grade in which consumers are most cost-conscious.
   In an interview Thursday, Cook acknowledged that such a gas
would inevitably mean higher pump prices.
   He said Arco won't market such a fuel until Congress finalizes
clean-air standards nationwide and all oil companies will have to
market the gasolines.
   ``It will be four or five years and a $2 billion investment
before we can get close,'' Cook said.
   That investment will have to be borne by the whole industry, he
said. While Arco was willing to shoulder ``several millions of
dollars'' in development costs on a fuel like EC-Premium, ``we
can't take a $2 billion hit all by ourselves.''

   The stock market staged a broad retreat Thursday
under renewed pressure from rising oil prices and intensified
recession worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 31.93 to
2,596.29.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
511 up, 960 down and 490 unchanged.
   The price of oil climbed as pessimism spread about chances for
any early resolution of the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   Crude oil futures for October delivery jumped $1.66 a barrel, to
$31.43 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   In addition, analysts said buyers were holding back awaiting the
Labor Department's report Friday morning on the employment
situation for August. The figures are expected to show continued
weakness in the economy.
   Speculation has begun to spread on Wall Street that the data
might encourage the Federal Reserve to adopt a more stimulative
credit policy in an effort to ease strains on the economy and the
banking system.
   But Wall Streeters are not entirely convinced that long-term
interest rates would automatically fall in response to such a move.
   In fact, some say, rates could rise in that setting if fears
increased that the Fed was softening its stand against inflation.
That, in turn, would stand to leave the central bank in an even
worse policy bind than it has to contend with now.
   Sluggish August sales figures from leading retailing companies,
meanwhile, helped to fan recession fears and induced selling of
several retail stocks.
   The Limited fell 1&lsqb; to 15|; Wal-Mart Stores ~ to 27{; Toys R Us
} to 23}; Petrie Stores | to 19&rsqb;, and J.C. Penney 1 to 45~.
   Losers among the blue chips included Boeing, down 1{ at 47\;
General Electric, down \ at 60; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,
down | at 31{, and Pepsico, down } at 24{.
   Fedders Corp. posted the day's biggest percentage decline among
NYSE issues, down 1} at 7&rsqb;. The company said it expects to report
losses for the third and fourth quarters, citing excess inventories
in the distribution system for room air conditioners.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 125.62 million
shares, against 120.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 152.68 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $30.83 billion, or 1.00
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.87 to 176.06.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.87 to 379.48, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.93 at 320.46.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 3.66 to 378.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 324.50, down .91.

   Westcott Communications, an operator of
specialized satellite television networks, announced plans Thursday
to start up a satellite programming service for security guards.
   The Professional Security Television Network would be the third
offering from the Westcott, which also operates the Automotive
Satellite Television Network and the Law Enforcement Television
Network.
   PSTN will broadcast on Tuesdays and Thursdays and will offer
about 400 hours of programming per year, chairman Carl Westcott
said.
   Programming will include news briefs and informational and
training programs and is expected to begin in the first quarter of
1991, Westcott said.
   The service would cost $688 a month.
   ``Our target market is the 2,000 largest companies in America
that have a security department, that are interested in their
employees' security in internal security and external security,''
Westcott said.
   Westcott said no satellite has been picked to transmit the the
programming and there are no subscribers as yet to the service,
which will be introduced to the industry at a security officers'
convention in San Francisco Sept. 10.
   ASTN serves 5,000 subscribers in the automotive industry. LETN,
begun in 1989, has 1,800 subscribers in law enforcement agencies
across the country.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed in Thin Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar finished mostly lower in thin trading
on the world's currency markets Thursday as speculation mounted
over whether the Federal Reserve is poised to nudge interest rates
lower.
   The U.S. currency took its biggest hit against the Japanese yen,
falling to an 11-month low, and gave up significant ground against
the British pound.
   Analysts said the market's attention is tuned to the Labor
Department's release Friday of unemployment statistics for August
on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will respond by pushing
interest rates lower to give the economy a boost.
   The market consensus contends the report will show a gain of
between 50,000 to 65,000 jobs on non-farm payrolls. But it is
unclear whether a figure within that range would prompt the Fed to
take action.
   The nation's central bank is under considerable pressure to
notch rates lower to avert a recession. At the same time, though,
lower interest rates could fan inflation as oil price continue to
rise.
   Some speculate the Fed will opt against easing, because of the
sagging dollar.
   ``The dollar is too weak to ease now,'' said Earl Johnson, a
vice president at Chicago-based Harris Trust and Savings Bank. The
weaker the dollar, the less incentive for foreigners to invest in
dollar-denominated securities.
   Foreign capital is critical to the financing of the nation's
budget deficit. The United States has attracted foreign capital in
the past by offering higher yields on government securities than
those available elsewhere in the industrialized world. But the
interest-rate advantage has been narrowed as yields in Europe and
Japan have advanced recently.
   Analysts note that returns on short-term instruments, like
three-month Treasury bills, are simply not as alluring as they once
were.
   The pound, meanwhile, was bolstered by anticipation that Britain
will join the European exchange rate mechanism at a meeting of
European finance ministers in Rome this weekend. The mechanism
establishes currency rates for a basket of European Community
countries.
   Despite week-long weakness in the Japanese stock market, the yen
has continued to gain ground _ at the expense of the dollar and a
number of continental currencies.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 141.65 Japanese yen from
142.30 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it fell further
to 141.05 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 140.65 yen, down
from 141.65 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9075 from $1.8990 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.9125 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.9055.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5560 German marks, down from 1.5580;
1.2975 Swiss francs, up from 1.2940; 5.2135 French francs, down
from 5.2180; 1,161.50 Italian lire, down from 1,162.00, and 1.1563
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1525.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5590 German marks, down from 1.5630;
1.2985 Swiss francs, up from 1.2963; 5.2168 French francs, down
from 5.2375; 1.7545 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7607; 1,162.50
Italian lire, down from 1,166.00, and 1.1575 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1532.
   Gold prices rose worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, a troy ounce of gold for September delivery added $3.60 a to
settle at $389.70. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of
$389.85 for a ounce of gold, up $2.65 from Wednesday's 4 p.m. EDT
bid.
   In London, gold traded at a late bid price of $389.50 a troy
ounce, up from $387.75 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal
rose to a closing bid of $388.80 from $385.75. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold rose $3.57 to close at a bid $387.59 an ounce.
   Silver prices also advanced. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.770 a troy ounce, up from $4.735
on Wednesday. In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $4.80
a troy ounce from $4.78.

<HEAD>Franklin Managers Return to Offices after Judge's Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Managers of Franklin Savings
Association returned to their offices for the first time in six
months Thursday, one day after a federal judge said regulators
improperly seized the state's largest thrift.
   Franklin Chairman Ernest Fleischer and other board members met
with officials from the Resolution Trust Corp. at 11 a.m. EDT, the
deadline U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels had given regulators
to return the thrift.
   ``We waited for a couple minutes and then the order came in from
(Office of Thrift Supervision director) Timothy Ryan to return the
thrift to us, and that's what they did,'' said John Scowcroft,
president of Franklin's holding company.
   But court action continued.
   Government attorneys filed a motion shortly after 11 a.m. with
the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, asking for a stay
in the judge's order while the government appeals the ruling.
Earlier Thursday morning, Saffels had denied a similar request for
a stay.
   The appeals court had taken no action by afternoon.
   Roger Stanton, the lead attorney for Franklin, said he would be
surprised if the appeals court granted a stay. Franklin considered
the government's request moot because it was filed after 11 a.m.,
he said.
   Scowcroft and Fleische when he was
befriended by Perlasca.
   Ronai says he feels guilty that he never searched for Perlasca
after the war to thank him for the phony ``letters of protection''
he issued to Jewish families, or the scraps of food Perlasca
delivered to the starving inhabitants of Jewish safe houses that
flew the Spanish flag.
   ``At least he is alive and at last, we are able to talk to each
other,'' Ronai said.
   From October 1944 until January 1945, when Budapest was
liberated by Soviet troops, Perlasca masqueraded as a Spanish
diplomat and provided sanctuary for an estimated 5,200 Jews facing
wholesale slaughter by Hungarian Nazi thugs.
   He saw a Jewish boy's skull crushed by Nazi rifle butts. He
rescued a naked girl from a massacre of hundreds of screaming Jews
who were marched out of the Budapest ghetto, shot to death and
dumped into the Danube River. He confronted Adolf Eichmann during a
train station tug-of-war over young Jewish twins _ and won their
release.
   Stared down by an indignant and unyielding Perlasca, Eichmann
told his underlings: ``Let them go. Their time will come, too.''
   Eichmann, who engineered Nazi Germany's wartime extermination of
6 million European Jews, was seized by Israeli agents in 1960,
convicted by a Jerusalem court of crimes against humanity, and
hanged in 1962.
   ``His time came, too,'' Perlasca said.
   Incredibly, two former Gestapo officers knocked on Perlasca's
door in Padua before Eichmann went on trial, beseeching him to
testify as a character witness for the defendant. Perlasca
brusquely refused.
   Unlike Wallenberg, the celebrated Swedish diplomat who saved
tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest before he disappeared,
Perlasca's exploits were virtually unknown in the United States
until very recently.
   His name appeared occasionally in the Italian and Israeli press.
Two years ago, the Yad V'Shem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem
hailed him as ``Righteous Among the Nations of the World.''
   His story was discovered by Miles Lerman, an executive of the
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council, during a visit to Budapest last
fall.
   The council is a federal agency overseeing construction of a
privately financed, $147 million Holocaust museum near the National
Mall. When it opens in April 1993, Lerman said, its exhibits will
include the story of Perlasca's extraordinary acts of courage.
   ``In this sea of darkness, there were flickers of light from a
few people,'' Lerman said. ``There weren't many who cared to step
forward while other good people stood idly by and did nothing. But
their choices made the difference between life and death.
   ``In the total darkness of cruelty and indifference, they found
that goodness has a power of its own, and they became beacons of
light who redeemed mankind,'' he said.
   Perlasca speaks more modestly of his perilous feats 45 years
ago, when he was the Hungarian representative of a Rome-based
company that supplied meat to the Italian army.
   ``I always say, the opportunity makes a thief,'' Perlasca said,
speaking through an interpreter. ``My opportunity was there, and I
took it. Maybe those who remained silent didn't have the
opportunity.''

<HEAD>Oil Prices Back Above $30 Per Barrel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices soared over $30 a barrel Thursday,
reaching that plateau for the second time since the Persian Gulf
crisis as traders bet that supply shortages will develop.
   Light sweet crude rose throughout a hectic day of trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, closing up $1.66 at $31.43 per barrel
for October contracts. At its peak Thursday, oil traded at $31.58.
   ``The U.S. Energy Department testified yesterday to Congress
that they thought there'd be a shortage of oil this winter,'' said
Philip L. Dodge, an analyst with Nomura Securities International
Inc. ``That was enough to move the markets. Also, there's no sign
of peace breaking out in the gulf.''
   Oil futures had last traded above $30 per barrel on Aug. 22-24,
at one point matching the all-time Merc high of $32.35. Before that
surge, the Merc had not seen $30 crude since November 1985.
   The stock market took a sharp dive Thursday in the face of
rising oil prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling
31.93 points to 2,596.29.
   Unleaded gasoline futures also traded higher, up 2.8 cents to
95.07 cents per gallon for October delivery. Analysts partially
attributed the increase to a realization that increased crude
output by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela will not accommodate most U.S.
refineries because it is a more difficult oil to refine.
   Even though those nations are exceeding temporarily their OPEC
production limits to make up for the shortfall caused by the
boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, petroleum experts fear that
refinery capacity in Kuwait cannot be replaced quickly.
   ``Gasoline is the item to worry about,'' Dodge said. ``It was in
relatively short supply going into the crisis. Also, the oil that
replaces the Iraqi crude has a lower yield of gasoline. The excess
oil that's being made up by the Saudis and the Venezuelans is sour,
heavy crude, which is not something the U.S. refineries like to run
through their systems.''
   Domestic refinery operators prefer light sweet crude, which has
less sulfur and costs less to refine.
   The petroleum markets opened strong on news that an American
citizen had been shot in the hand by an Iraqi police officer in
Kuwait. The continued tensions in the Middle East kept oil high all
day.
   Prices were also bolstered by bullish markets in Europe, where
tight supplies might cut U.S. imports of heating oil, said Brendan
Dolan, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``That's helping (to) fuel the buying for crude right now,''
Dolan said.
   Home heating oil was up 4.87 cents to 88.24 cents for October
delivery. Natural gas for October closed at $1.530 per 1,000 cubic
feet, up from $1.514 a day earlier.
   Later contract months for the petroleum futures were all higher,
with oil above $30 per barrel for November and December delivery.
   Although oil's initial rise above $30 per barrel last month
caught futures traders by surprise, one expert said Thursday there
was no particular significance to the number.
   ``Thirty dollars is just a magical number, as $25 was,'' said
Thomas C. Lewis, a vice president with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in
Chicago. ``The next one will be $35.''

   Paramount Communications Inc. is in the market
for a merger or acquisition, but has already passed on specific
chances to invest in the theme park, recorded music and publishing
fields, its chairman said Thursday.
   Martin S. Davis, who is also chief executive, made the comments
as Paramount reported that earnings for its third quarter rose 10.3
percent from a year ago. Improvement in Paramount's publishing
operations more than offset a decline in operating income from its
entertainment business.
   Davis has indicated on several occasions that Paramount is
interested in making a purchase or arranging a merger in
entertainment or publishing.
   The company made a failed bid for Time Inc. last year but
subsequently raised a considerable amount of cash by selling its
financial services arm, Associates Corp. of North America, for
$3.35 billion last year.
   Nonetheless, most analysts say they expect Paramount is probably
exploring relatively small strategic deals rather than large ones,
especially given the depressed condition of the stock market
recently.
   Davis was quoted in a report Thursday by Dow Jones News Service
as saying Paramount continues to hold talks with a number of
companies he declined to identify regarding a possible merger or
acquisition.
   ``We have looked at specific opportunities to invest in the
theme park and recorded music businesses, but we ultimately
concluded that the opportunities presented could not achieve an
acceptable return on our investment given the acquisition process
and growth potential of the companies,'' he was quoted.
   But he said the company would explore other opportunities in
these areas.
   He also said acquisition candidates in publishing and
information services were abandoned because the prices were too
high.
   Jerry Sherman, a spokesman for Paramount, said Davis was in
meetings and unavailable for comment, but said the account of
Davis' remarks was accurate. For the three months ended July 31,
Paramount earned $106.2 million, or 88 cents a share, compared with
$96.3 million, or 80 cents a share, a year ago.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 8.8 percent to $1.04 billion from
$951 million a year earlier.
   The latest results include net interest income of $10.6 million,
mainly due to investment of proceeds from the Associates sale. The
1989 results included net interest expense of $32.1 million, a
charge of $48.3 million related to Paramount's unsuccessful bid for
Time Inc. and $77.8 million in earnings from The Associates.
   Operating income from publishing rose 11 percent in the quarter
to $115.2 million as gains in educational and international
publishing sales more than offset lower results from consumer
publishing and a flat performance in professional information.
   But the company said operating income from entertainment dropped
4 percent in the quarter to $55.1 million as gains in television
operations were more than offset by declines in motion picture and
theater operations and costs associated with the renovation of
Madison Square Garden.
   It noted that the bulk of the profits from domestic distribution
of its summer blockbuster ``Ghosts'' will be recorded in the fourth
quarter.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Paramount said it
earned $148.6 million, or $1.23 a share, down 36 percent from
$231.1 million, or $1.93 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the nine months rose 11.2 percent to $2.69 billion
from $2.42 billion a year earlier.
   Davis was also quoted as saying the company now expected to be
``at the lower end'' of its earlier forecast of full year earnings
of $2.10 to $2.60 a share. Paramount earned $12.21 a share in
fiscal 1989 including a onetime gain of $10.05 on the sale of The
Associates.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One measure of the nation's money supply rose
and another fell in the week ended Aug. 27, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 declined to to a seasonally
adjusted $3,304.7 billion from $3,305.4 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,091.3 billion from $4,087.4 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $815.4 billion from $817.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.2 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.9 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,286.7 billion, a 1.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,075.5 billion, up 0.6 percent, while M1
rose 2.7 percent to an average of $811.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _ The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $709 million.
   _ The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $762 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$500 million the previous week.
   _ The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $217
million in the two weeks ended Wednesday, up from a revised net
borrowed reserves of $182 million in the previous two-week period.
   _ The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $313.3 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $313.7 billion two weeks earlier.

   The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. said Thursday
it will eliminate 1,180 jobs in Europe by mid-1992 in an ongoing
restructuring effort that has cut jobs in the United States and
Canada.
   The company also announced it expects to incur an estimated $51
million in after-tax charges in the third quarter to cover
restructuring and environmental cleanup costs linked to production
sites closed in 1986.
   In a statement, Goodyear Chairman Tom H. Barrett predicted that
competitive forces within the tire industry and higher costs tied
to instability in the Middle East create an atmosphere for a
general economic downturn the rest of this year and in 1991.
   Barrett said Goodyear will focus on containing costs while
improving the efficiency of North American and European operations.
   ``These measures are designed to strengthen our core businesses
as we continue our focus on improving production efficiencies and
the development of high quality products which meet the needs of
our customers,'' Barrett said.
   Company spokesman Walt McClenny said the company has a European
workforce of about 20,000.
   In July, Goodyear reported a loss of $9.4 million in the second
quarter due to charges resulting from the restructuring of tire
operations and the closing of a roofing systems plant.
   The loss amounted to 16 cents per share for the quarter ended
June 30 compared with a profit of $27.1 million, or 47 cents per
share, a year ago. Sales in the quarter rose slightly to $2.87
billion from $2.81 billion.
   Those results included a charge of $21.4 million, or 37 cents a
share, due to restructuring.
   In the first half, Goodyear earned $11.5 million, or 20 cents
per share, on sales of $5.56 billion. That compared with $121.6
million, or $2.11 per share, on sales of $5.45 billion in the first
half of 1989.
   Citing sluggishness in the auto industry and concerns about
inventory, Goodyear announced last week its plans to lay off 800
employees at manufacturing plants in Tennessee and Quebec. Goodyear
said Aug. 30 that the duration of the layoffs would depend on ``the
economy and market demand.''
   Valleyfield, Quebec, has Goodyear's largest Canadian plant. The
temporary layoffs of 530 workers follow Goodyear's recent
announcement of plans to lay off 360 workers there by year's end
because the plant is discontinuing production of medium- and
heavy-duty truck tires.
   In June, Goodyear revealed a plan to eliminate 1,100 jobs and
take a $35 million charge in the second quarter as part of a
restructuring of its U.S. tire sales and support staff. Those job
cuts were to be phased in through layoffs and early retirements.

<HEAD>Gold Nears $390 As Rebound Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gold neared $390 an ounce Thursday, the third straight day of
rising prices as the market continued its recovery from last week's
collapse.
   But unlike last month's explosive rally, analysts said gold's
current strength appeared to reflect investor concerns about the
economy rather than knee-jerk reactions to Persian Gulf
developments.
   On other markets, oil prices soared following reports that Iraqi
police shot an American civilian in the hand in occupied Kuwait;
grains and soybeans advanced; and livestock and meat futures were
mostly higher.
   Gold futures settled $3.20 to $3.60 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for spot delivery up $3.60 at
$389.70 a troy ounce. The heavily traded December contract settled
at $396.20.
   Silver futures settled 3.3 cents to 3.7 cents higher with
September at $4.77 a troy ounce.
   Spot gold has climbed $7.40 an ounce this week after plunging
$32.70 last week amid perceptions that the U.S.-Iraq confrontation
was cooling down.
   Heightened tensions in the Gulf this week have provided support
for gold but investors seem to be responding more to economic news,
especially inflation signals, said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst who
follows the precious metal and oil markets for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   Gold is often considered an investment hedge against inflation.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate
banking committee Wednesday it could take several years to reduce
the U.S. inflation rate. Platt said that remark apparently sparked
some of the demand for gold.
   ``It appears that in this point in time, the monetary
authorities have given up on trying to contain inflationary
pressures in the U.S. economy and appear to be focusing on how to
limit any kind of recessionary tendency that might be popping up,''
he said.
   Oil prices rose sharply for the fifth straight day on the New
York Mercantile Exchange as traders responded to the Middle East
developments and to Wednesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute
inventory report, which showed a larger-than-expected drop last
week in U.S. supplies of crude oil.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 64 cents to $1.66 higher
with October at $31.43 a barrel; heating oil was 1.85 cents to 4.87
cents higher with October at 88.24 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 2.75 cents to 3.38 cents higher with October at 95.07
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid expectations of more sales of U.S. grain to the
Soviet Union.
   The soybean market drew further support from reports that hot,
dry weather has begun to stress soybeans in Nebraska as well as in
the Mississippi Delta region, which has been unusually dry all
summer, analysts said.
   Speculation continued to mount that the United States will grant
credit to the Soviet Union for purchases of agricultural
commodities, said William Biedermann, director of research with
Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents to 2} cents higher with September
at $2.65} a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1} cents higher with
September at $2.43 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher
with September at $1.11\ a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 5{
cents higher with September at $6.17\ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures were boosted
by higher cash steer prices and active retail beef movement.
Near-term hog futures also advanced but the deferred contracts
settled lower amid expectations that hog marketings will increase
next week when cooler weather is expected in the Midwest.
   Live cattle futures settled .03 cent to .55 cent higher with
October at 77.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with September at 87 cents a pound; live hogs
were .22 cent lower to .08 cent higher with October at 49.35 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .82 cent to 1 cent higher with
February at 52.05 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Judge Extends Asbestos Trust Payment Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday extended a freeze on
payments to asbestos victims by the Manville trust for one month to
complete a restructuring plan for the fund.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein said more time was needed
to ``work out the details'' of a court order to rehabilitate the
finances of the trust, which has run out of money to pay tens of
thousands of new asbestos health claims.
   It was the second month-long extension by Weinstein. The freeze
applies to paying all claims or court judgments made since the
first order in August or until the new Oct. 6 expiration date.
   The trust was created in 1988 as part of Manville Corp.'s
bankruptcy court reorganization, which was forced by mounting
liability for lung cancer and other serious and fatal diseases
caused by asbestos.
   Leon Silverman, a New York attorney appointed by Weinstein as a
special adviser to restructure the trust, said negotiations were
continuing on completing a reorganization plan.
   Under the freeze, the trust is permitted to make payments for
hardship claims and emergency health needs, as well as operating
expenses, legal fees of trust attorneys and Silverman's fees.
   The trust to date has settled close to 24,000 claims for more
than $1 billion from people made sick inhaling asbestos fibers,
mostly during shipbuilding and other construction. About a third of
that money has gone toward lawyers' fees.
   The trust faces 130,000 more claims it can't meet. The
reorganization order came after the trust said it was out of money
to pay new claims it said would not be met until well into the 21st
century.
   The reorganization is designed to speed payments and alter the
compensation scheme to process claims based on victims' health and
financial need rather than when they file a claim.
   The trust effectively owns 80 percent of Denver-based Manville,
which must make annual payments to the trust beginning next year
and is shielded from further legal liability for asbestos claims.
   The cash shortage at the trust had been anticipated, but made
worse by more cases, larger payouts and quicker settlements than
expected. Victims had received an average of $43,000 per claim,
compared with estimates of $25,000.

<TEXT>
   While Saddam Hussein has given new
urgency to an old debate over whether America's friends should bear
more of the burden for defending democracy, the response from most
allies in the current crisis has been far from overwhelming.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is on an 18,500-mile odyssey
that has taken him from Europe to Asia in search of economic
assistance, while Secretary of State James A. Baker III launched
his own Middle East fund-raising mission Thursday in the Saudi
Arabian capital of Jiddah.
   The two Cabinet members are seeking aid to defray the high cost
of keeping a protective U.S. military shield on the Saudi-Kuwaiti
border.
   Back at home, a third Cabinet officer, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney, was keeping the verbal pressure on, declaring in a speech,
``We need to have some of our friends step up to the counter and
contribute more than some of them have indicated that they are
prepared to contribute.''
   Shortly after Baker arrived, Saudi Arabia said it would commit
several billion dollars toward the cost of defending the kingdom's
oil fields.
   And, following meetings earlier this week in Paris and London,
Brady insisted he was getting strong words of encouragement,
especially from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   But while the words have been effusive, the flow of money from
most countries has not.
   Neither the French nor the British committed to specific dollar
amounts and officials of the 12-nation European Community were
scheduled to take up the question of increased assistance at a
meeting Friday.
   While one official traveling with Brady on the flight from
London to Seoul said it would not be unreasonable for the allies to
pick up the entire $1 billion monthly cost of the U.S. troop
buildup, that statement was viewed more as a negotiating ploy than
a reasonable expectation of the outcome.
   For one thing, the Brady delegation faced an even harder sell in
meetings Friday with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   The administration is turning to the two economic powerhouses in
Asia for support since both nations depend heavily on Middle
Eastern oil.
   Japan has pledged $1 billion to support the troop buildup, but
did so only after Bush made a personal call to Kaifu.
   The administration says privately what critics in Congress are
saying openly _ that Japan should do much more, given the size of
its economy.
   The current debate has echoes that reach back to the height of
the Cold War, when critics contended that America's huge military
burden was diverting resources from critical areas such as making
the investments needed to boost productivity.
   Japan and other countries without large military obligations
were getting a free ride, the argument went, allowing them to make
the enormous investments needed to complete effectively in the
world marketplace.
   In dispatching Brady and Bush on their money missions, President
Bush declared that the ``shape of the post-Cold War world'' was at
stake in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   What he left unsaid was that America, hobbled by a sluggish
economy and a huge mountain of debt, can no longer afford to go it
alone.
   But officials traveling with Brady insist that the fund-raising
effort would make sense even if the administration weren't
bedeviled by the mammoth budget deficit.
   They note that when the European Community dismantles its
economic barriers in 1992, the combined economies of its dozen
members will equal America's $5 trillion annual gross national
product. Meanwhile, Japan's exploding GNP could well surpass that
of the United States by the end of this decade.
   ``We live in a changing world, whether there is a budget deficit
or not,'' said one senior official traveling with Brady who spoke
on condition that he not be named. ``In that changed world, we
Americans have a right to expect that the burdens will be shared
more appropriately.''
   Despite the lukewarm public response from countries being
targeted for aid, other forces could prod the allies to do more.
   For one thing, Japan risks triggering an avalanche of resentment
in its biggest foreign market unless it pays a bigger share.
   In addition, there is a belief that the allies cannot afford to
waver in this effort, given the threat posed by Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   Both the Brady and Baker missions were designed as highly
visible campaigns to demonstrate that the allies are a united
force, thus raising the stakes considerably if there is a perceived
failure.
   ``One of the most important audiences for this whole thing is
Saddam Hussein,'' said another official on Brady's plane who spoke
on background. ``We need to let him see that this is not one
country or a couple of countries, but it really is the whole
world.''

<TEXT>
   Top Michigan officials expressed
satisfaction Thursday with the credit ratings given a new program
designed to help young couples save for the down payments for their
first homes.
   Gov. James Blanchard said Michigan got the highest credit rating
possible for short-term bonds to be sold under the Home Ownership
Savings Trust.
   The ratings for long-term bonds in the HOST program parallel
Michigan's overall bond rating and are just one notch below the
highest, said state Treasurer Robert Bowman.
   Both said the interest rates reflect the evaluation of
Michigan's financial strength, especially when compared to other
areas of the nation, which are slumping.
   The HOST program guarantees money invested in it will grow at
least as fast as housing inflation in Michigan.
   Moody's Investors Service rated the short-term bonds MIG-1 and
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. gave them a SP-1 rating, officials said.
   Long-term features of the HOST program _ for investments lasting
more than about a year _ will carry an AA rating from Standard &amp;
Poor's, A-1 from Moody's and AA from Fitch Investors Service.
   Acquiring a credit rating was needed to market the HOST bonds,
which will go on sale shortly, officials said.
   Under the program, investors can buy the general obligation
bonds with monthly payments, a lump sum, or a combination of both
for up to five years. The investors estimate how much they'll need
for a down payment and a payment schedule is set based on that.
   The minimum savings plan would require payments of $50 a month,
Bowman said.
   About 6,000 people have expressed interest in the tax-free HOST
investments so far, officials said.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. said Thursday it would
form a joint venture to produce instant cameras, package film and
market imaging products in the People's Republic of China.
   A Polaroid division, Polaroid of Shanghai Ltd., will initially
employ 130 people in the joint venture with SMPIC, formerly the
Shanghai Motion Picture Co., Polaroid said. SMPIC is a corporation
of the Shanghai Light Industry bureau, a branch of the Chinese
Ministry of Light Industry.
   The venture is part of Polaroid's long-term growth strategy to
expand the market for instant photography, said I. MacAllister
Booth, Polaroid's president and chief executive officer.
   During this past year, Polaroid opened manufacturing facilities
and a retail store in Moscow, founded Polaroid India Inc. and
activated Polaroid Oy in Finland, Booth said.
   ``Now, with the establishment of Polaroid in Shanghai, Polaroid
is continuing to develop new market potential,'' he said in a
statement.
   The venture comes slightly more than a year after the Tiananmen
Square massacre and the subsequent pullout of some U.S. business
interests from the country.
   Harry Johnson, a Polaroid spokesman, said the project's
implementation was slowed in the wake of the crackdown on the
student democracy movement in 1989. It was continued after
discussions with the U.S. government ``to determine whether the
action was appropriate,'' he said. ``A good many questions have
been asked.''
   Initially, Polaroid of Shanghai will assemble Polaroid
Supercolor 635CL instant cameras, the company said. Used
extensively in business applications, the camera will retail for
about $100.
   Cameras and film will be marketed to business and industrial
markets as well as to China's more than 2,500 street photographers,
Polaroid said.
   Cameras will be assembled beginning later this year at the
Shanghai Xian Feng Factory. For the past two years, the factory has
been assembling the camera's printed circuit boards for export to
Polaroid plants overseas.
   As part of its effort to introduce instant photography to China,
Polaroid will be a sponsor of the 1990 Asian Games beginning in
Beijing Sept. 22.

<HEAD>Mack Signs Merger Plan with Renault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Mack Trucks Inc.
announced Thursday it has approved an $81 million buyout by Renault
Vehicules Industriels SA.
   Mack said the agreement, which calls for the Paris-based Renault
to pay $6.25 a share, was reached earlier in the week.
   Renault started the week with 44.5 percent of Mack's 29 million
shares. On Wednesday, the French firm purchased 4.5 percent more.
   The French firm hopes to buy the rest of the stock by Sept. 20,
said Renault spokesman Bill Catacosinos.
   The car company has been trying to buy out the Allentown-based
firm for several months, saying it was making the offer ``because
of the continuing deterioration of the financial condition of
Mack'' and the need to restructure the company's debt.
   Mack lost a record $185.4 million last year and lost $97.2
million in the six months ending June 30.
   Net sales for the first half of 1990 were $793.9 million, a 22
percent decrease from the $1 billion in sales in the 1989 period.
   The company's five-year financial plan in July projected a net
loss of about $130 million for this year. At the time, Mack
officials said they did not expect the company to show a profit
before 1992.
   In the past year, Mack has tried to reduce business costs and
conserve cash amid a slowing market for heavy trucks.
   Mack's financial advisor, BT Securities Corp., called the $6.25
per share offer fair.
   Mack spokesman James A. Santanasto said Thursday the merger
would have no immediate effect on the truck company's employees.
   ``This just reflects a corporate change,'' he said.
   Catacosinos said it was too early to predict any changes.
   ``This is still in the preliminary stages,'' he said.
   Mack is one of North America's largest producers of heavy-duty
diesel trucks. Mack also markets a line of medium-duty diesel
trucks throughout North America and parts of Central America,
Australia and New Zealand.

<HEAD>Made in America Ad Campaign Gets Tougher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American textile and fiber makers are talking
tougher.
   They have dumped the celebrities who grinned as they flashed the
``Made in U.S.A.'' labels for the cameras in those old buy-American
commercials.
   In a new round of ads that debut this weekend on NBC's telecast
of the Miss America Pageant, they show shoppers making excuses for
buying imports while workers cart their belongings outside a plant
closing for good.
   In another commercial, a mother explains to her bewildered young
son that they are moving because his father's plant shut down.
   Why did the plant close, the boy asks. ``Because a lot of people
are buying clothes made in other countries, not ours,'' Mom replies.
   Welcome to the sober new world as seen by the Crafted With Pride
in U.S.A. Council, a non-profit organization set up in 1984 to
encourage sales of U.S.-made clothes and home furnishings, and its
ad agency, Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore.
   Robert E. Swift, executive director of the council, said the
group decided on the new approach in reponse to surveys that
indicate consumers are growing more concerned about their reduced
standard of living.
   Imported clothing, for instance, accounts for nearly 60 percent
of all clothing sales in the United States, he said.
   But when Americans are asked about imports, he said they usually
cite the car market, where foreigners have captured only a
one-third share.
   Swift said he hopes the ads get American consumers to think
about what impact imports are having in apparel and furnishings as
well.
   The council estimates that nearly 500,000 jobs have been lost in
the U.S. apparel and textile industries since 1980. Swift said the
new ads should make consumers aware that job losses and plant
shutdowns not only hurt American workers, but hurt the community
tax base and their own standard of living.
   Swift declined to say how much the council would spend over the
next year to run the ads on television. But he said the new
campaign will start off with more support than the council has
spent in launching any earlier campaign.
   The celebrity campaign that kicked off the council's ``Made in
U.S.A.'' campaign in 1985 was useful in calling attention to the
quality and value of American-made products, Swift said.
   While imports' share of the clothes market rose to 59 percent
last year from 47 percent in 1985, he said the pace at which the
imports' share was rising has slowed considerably.

   Worldwide economic growth continues to be
sluggish, according to a report released Thursday by a business
research group.
   The Conference Board said its composite leading index for 11 of
the major industrialized nations is growing at an annual rate of 2
percent, the same rate as three months ago.
   The latest figure, which projects future economic conditions,
predates the Persian Gulf crisis, it noted.
   ``The recent curtailment of oil supplies and rise in the cost of
oil will likely add a depressing influence to the slow growth
prospects already shown by the leading indexes for most
countries,'' said Geoffrey Moore, director of Columbia University's
Center for Business Cycle Research, which compiles the Conference
Board's monthly index.
   The Conference Board, a business-funded research organization,
studied the economies of the United States, Canada, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea and
New Zealand.
   The West German economy grew at the fastest annual pace, 4
percent, while Australia had the worst performance, with a 3
percent annual rate of decline.

<HEAD>Oldsmobile to Offer Warranty on Used Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAKE ORION, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oldsmobile dealers will offer a
warranty and roadside assistance program on used cars by the end of
the year, General Motors Corp. officials said Thursday.
   The program is expected to help Oldsmobile dealers resell cars
originally purchased by large fleet buyers, such as rental-car
companies.
   Mercedes-Benz is the only other automaker to offer a special
used-car warranty.
   The Oldsmobile program is an extension of the ``Oldsmobile
Edge'' program offered on all new cars sold by the GM division.
That program included provisions for return of a new Oldsmobile for
credit toward a new one and a roadside assistance program.
   Oldsmobile General Manager Michael Losh said that during the
last year, about 1.2 percent of new Oldsmobiles bought were
returned under the ``Oldsmobile Edge'' program. He estimated a 1
percent rate when he announced the program last year.
   About half of the cars were returned because customers changed
their minds about a feature of the vehicle and the other half were
returned because of problems with the vehicle, he said.
   The used-car program _ called ``value rated'' _ covers
qualifying 1984-89 cars on Oldsmobile dealer lots, no matter what
make, with less than 50,000 miles.
   Cars qualifying for the warranty must pass a check list similar
to one used for every used car on an Oldsmobile dealer's used-car
lot. The program should help dealers by offering shoppers
lower-priced cars at Oldsmobile dealerships, Losh said.
   ``It's a way for our dealers to extend our product line,'' he
said.
   The company also will offer a ``value rated plus'' program for
Oldsmobiles from the 1990 or 1991 model years. That program is
aimed at directly helping dealers sell cars that were owned by
fleet purchasers, said Roy Pikus, Oldsmobile's direct marketing
manager.
   A cost hasn't been fixed, but Pikus estimated it would be
between $200 and $300 and probably would be passed on to the
customer through the price of the used car.
   The Mercedes-Benz program covers only cars made since 1980 by
the West German company which have less than 100,000 miles on them.
The Mercedes program is also geared toward dealers.
   Mercedes spokesman A.B. Schuman said Thursday that company
research shows that about 62 percent of the 4,000 people who bought
used cars under warranty last year were first-time Mercedes buyers,
72 percent said they would buy another Mercedes and 25 percent said
they would buy a new Mercedes.

   The Argentina Supreme Court
decided Thursday evening to review the latest legal challenge to
the controversial sale of the state-owned carrier Aerolineas
Argentinas.
   Hours earlier, administrative law judge Oscar Garzon Funes
ordered the sale suspended because the proposed buyers made the
down payment by letter of credit instead of cash.
   Garzon Funes gave the Public Works Ministry eight days to
explain why it accepted the letter of credit, after which he said
he would decide whether to annul the sale.
   The Supreme Court took the case out of Judge Garzon Funes' hands
on the grounds that it would be speedier to issue a single, final
ruling rather than have the case drag out in appeals courts.
   Six of the nine justices voted in favor, including all five
nominated by President Carlos Menem.
   A consortium led by Spain's state airline Iberia agreed last
July to buy 85 percent of Aerolineas for $260 million and the
retirement of $2 billion of Argentina's foreign debt.
   The down payment of $130 million, due Aug. 21, was paid by
letter of credit to the Banco Hispanamericano in New York.
   Iberia spokesman Margarita Blanco said from Madrid last week
that the consortium did not feel obliged to tie up $130 million in
cash because the Argentine government had not fulfilled its
obligation to obtain a waiver, or approval, from creditor banks.
   The underlying issue for Argentina, however, is the consortium's
financial stability and its intentions for the second largest
commercial fleet in Latin America.
   Opponents of the sale _ including Aerolineas labor unions and
nationalist elements of the ruling Peronist Party _ claim the
consortium is trying to sell or lease planes to come up with the
down payment, and may not intend to invest in the airline as
pledged.
   The vice president of the privatization committee of the lower
house of congress, Alberto Natale, last week urged the government
of President Carlos Menem to set aside the sale because the
consortium did not comply with its agreement.
   Menem wants to sell Aerolineas and virtually every other company
operated by the state as a way to reduce the fiscal deficit and
reorient Argentina toward a free market economy.
   However, even the president indicated he is irritated with how
the sale now appears to be stalled.
   Asked to comment on a Thursday report in the newspaper Clarin
that the consortium has requested the government's permission to
sell some Aerolineas planes to come up with the down payment, Menem
said, ``A maneuver of that kind ... would not be acceptable to the
government.''

<HEAD>Greenspan Believes Treasury Proposal Would Have Small Effect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board told
a Senate committee Thursday he believed mortgage interest rates
would rise only slightly if the government-backed mortgage-buying
corporations were forced to maintain the highest private credit
ratings.
   However, in his letter to Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., chairman
of the Banking Committee, Chairman Alan Greenspan did not give a
numerical estimate of the likely increase, saying only that studies
suggested it would be ``relatively small.''
   In follow-up questions to recent Greenspan testimony, Riegle had
noted the Treasury's proposal that the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. and the Federal National Mortgage Association be required to
win and maintain the best private credit ratings, triple-A ratings,
from the private credit rating agencies.
   Riegle asked for Greenspan's estimate of how much mortgage
interest rates would rise if the proposal were adopted.
   Rates would be expected to rise because the corporations would
be required to raise more shareholder capital to win the highest
rating. They can operate with less capital now because the credit
and capital markets assume the government would not let the
corporations fail.
   In his response, Greenspan said it was unclear how much of the
subsidy represented by the implicit government guarantee gets
passed along to people who take out mortgages and how much is
retained by shareholders of the corporations.
   But Greenspan noted that prices of shares in the corporations
had declined following the Treasury proposal, ``suggesting a
sizeable proportion of the subsidy has gone to shareholders.''
   Studies suggest the subsidy going to mortgage holders _ which
would be lost under the Treasury proposal _ is ``relatively
small,'' Greenspan wrote.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Board Voids Delaware's Bank-Insurance Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board's order voiding a
Delaware law that allows banks to sell insurance nationwide was the
result of a turf battle between the central bank and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., banking officials said Thursday.
   The insurance industry, however, which sought the order by
filing a complaint against Citicorp's insurance operation, scored
the decision as a major victory.
   The Delaware law, enacted in May, allows banks incorporated in
the state to write insurance policies nationwide through a
subsidiary.
   The Fed on Wednesday said Delaware's law violated federal
regulations and ordered Citicorp to close its insurance business in
Dover.
   ``What they're really trying to do is take the authority away
from the states and the FDIC in hopes Congress will put them (the
Fed) in charge of the banking system. It's all about turf,'' said
Philip S. Corwin, director of retail banking for the American
Bankers Association in Washington.
   The Fed's order targeted Family Guardian Life Insurance Co., a
company controlled by Citicorp's wholly-owned Citibank of Delaware.
   The company opened June 1 with plans to hire 500 people.
   Richard T. Collins, Citibank Delaware vice president, said bank
officials were reviewing the order, but the Dover operation had not
been closed.
   When the law was being drafted, the FDIC asked that it include
safeguards to protect the banks' capital and deposits.
   The reserve board said those safeguards were so restrictive
they, in effect, barred the banks from the insurance business.
   Therefore the board ruled the Delaware law violated a federal
law that bars a subsidiary or division from engaging in a business
which the parent company is barred from engaging in.
   James B. Watt, president of the Conference of State Bank
Supervisors in Washington, said the reserve board was using ``a
technical interpretation to prevent something they don't want to
happen.''
   Corwin and Ellis both said they believed the state was caught in
a turf war between the reserve board and the FDIC.
   ``They put us in a Catch-22 to do all the FDIC wants and
basically the federal reserve said because you did such a good job,
we're not going to let you do it. That's untenable. Everyone is in
amazement,'' Ellis said.
   He said state officials will meet to determine what Delaware
will do next. Gov. Michael N. Castle had no comment.
   The Fed's order was the result of a petition from a coalition of
insurance trade groups to bar Citicorp's insurance business,
claiming the law would create unfair competition in the industry.
   Since 1981, Delaware has enacted several laws aimed at financial
services.
   For instance, in 1981, the state enacted a law offering tax
breaks for credit card operations and eliminating interest rate
ceilings on credit cards. The purpose was to convince out-of-state
banks to move their credit card operations to Delaware.
   The banking-insurance law was aimed at banks that relocated or
opened subsidiaries under the 1981 law.

   Fox Broadcasting Co. announced Thursday it
will begin distributing its shows via cable television in markets
where it has not been able to sign affiliates.
   Fox reached an agreement with Denver, Colo.-based
TeleCommunications Inc. that could allow it to reach up to 6
million new households, said Jamie Kellner, Fox Broadcasting Co.
president.
   ``It's the beginning of a relationship that will become our
delivery system in areas where there are no Fox affiliates,'' he
said.
   Fox is about to expand its three-night prime time programming to
five nights in prime time and has scheduled its popular cartoon
``The Simpsons'' against NBC-TV's highly-rated ``The Cosby Show.''
   Kellner said Fox had received letters from officials in cities
including Dubuque, Iowa requesting Fox programming.
   ``By . . . extending our programs on a direct cable feed to
areas that cannot support another broadcast station we can best
satisfy the growing viewer demand for Fox,'' Kellner said.
