<HEAD>BBC to Make First Domestic Broadcasts in Eastern Europe</HEAD>

   The British Broadcasting Corp. plans to launch a
24-hour service in Czechoslovakia this weekend, the first of its
kind in Eastern Europe, a BBC official says.
   BBC World Service programs are rebroadcast by radio stations in
several East European nations, but Czechoslovakia is the first to
allocate the BBC a domestic frequency.
   Andrew Taussig, European controller at the BBC World Service,
says Prague and Bratislava will receive the first service.
Broadcasts to the city of Brno will start in the next few days, he
says.
   ``Coming after more than 50 years, this is an historic moment
for the BBC and for our listeners as we deploy for the first time
on local soil a 24-hour service in English and local languages,''
said Taussig.
   The programs will be a mixture of BBC World Service items in
Czech, Slovak and English.
   The World Service, financed by the government, is broadcast
around the world in many languages and reaches about 120 million
listeners.

   The European Community environment
ministers have decided to ban the production and use of
ozone-harming chlorofluorocarbons by mid-1997, officials say.
   By Jan. 1, 1992, the 12-nation trade bloc will cut in half
production and importation of the manmade chemical often used as an
aerosol propellant. It will be outlawed by July 7, 1997, officials
said Friday.
   Chlorofluorocarbons are believed to deplete the ozone layer,
which protects the earth from ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
   The EC Commission is studying the possibility including a tax on
chlorofluorocarbons to speed up the ban.
   International agreements seek to ban chlorofluorocarbons by the
year 2000.

   The World Health Organization said about $6.4
million has been pledged to help ease worsening health conditions
among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   A WHO statement Friday said the funds were aimed at providing
emergency assistance to private hospitals hard hit by a drop in
revenues because of the Persian Gulf Crisis. Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia were traditional sources of funding for Palestinian health
care.
   The statement said Canada pledged $575,000, Germany offered
$465,000 and the European Community promised $5.4 million. The
offers came in response to an appeal by WHO Director-General Dr.
Hiroshi Nakajima.
   The Geneva-based health agency said about $9.1 million is needed
by hospitals in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Some hospitals in the occupied territories have stopped buying
new supplies and equipment and cut staff numbers and wages, the WHO
statement said.

   U.S. and British government officials have
suspended negotiations on efforts by United Airlines and American
Airlines for landing rights at London's Heathrow airport.
   There was no date for resumption of the talks, which were held
Thursday and Friday.
   Cyril Murphy, director of international operations for
Chiago-based United, no progress was made in the negotiations.
   British law has barred new entrants from congested Heathrow
since 1977 and diverted them to London's Gatwick and other British
airports.
   Many airlines have been clamoring for access to Heathrow, which
is served by the London subway system and offers more air
connections to Europe and elsewhere.
   Fort Worth, Texas-based American seeks to buy TWA's London and
other overseas routes for $445 million. United agreed in October to
buy most of Pan Am's London routes for $400 million.
   Both airlines have said the deals won't proceed unless they gain
access to Heathrow.
   An air services agreement allows successors to existing U.S.
airlines to assume their Heathrow rights. United and American say
they qualify.
   A spokesman for the British Department of Transport, who spoke
on anonymity, said British officials offered to resume meetings
next month.

   The floods of Japanese tourists
have ebbed. Sales are off by a third at some of the priciest stores
in the universe.
   Longtime merchants lament that only Cartier can afford the rent.
Indeed, some storefronts sit empty at the height of the shopping
season.
   But can the word recession ever apply on Rodeo Drive?
   After all, this is where they just opened a $200 million
mini-mall with 100,000 hand-set cobblestones. This is where $8,000
bustiers still sll at Giorgio Armani, hostesses drop $3,000 on
pillboxes for party favors and some sales clerks have six-figure
incomes.
   ``Retail's slow right now, so you just have to work harder,''
said Amen Wardy of the store of the same name, who began markdowns
at Thanksgiving to move merchandise.
   Sweaters originally priced at $2,050 could be had for a mere
$525 on one recent day. The price of leather jackets had shrunk
from $3,360 to $800.
   Still, Wardy continues to do a bustling business in non-sale
must-haves like sparkling Judith Leiber handbags costing up to
$5,000.
   Some of the gleaming clutches are designed like slices of
watermelon or orange. Bags custom-made to resemble your dog are
tagged at $2,400.
   ``The other evening, we sold 12 to one person,'' said saleswoman
Bette Donnell. ``Or someone will come in and take 12 of the
pillboxes as favors for a dinner party.''
   The pillboxes, rhinestone-encrusted baubles shaped like little
partridges and turbans, cost $180 to $305 each.
   Signals are similarly mixed up and down Rodeo this
recession-struck holiday season.
   ``Rodeo is slower than I've ever seen it,'' said Avi Amiel,
associate director at the Hanson Art Galleries, who has worked on
the street for six years. He said sales are off up to 30 percent.
   ``This time of year the street is usually so crowded you can
hardly walk out there. Now you can roller skate without hitting
anyone,'' Amiel said.
   Next door at Giorgio, though, salesman Johnny Zavala said
``signature items'' such as the perfume, $1,000 cashmere sweat
suits and $300 sweat shirts beaded with Austrian lead crystal
continue to sell to tourists from around the world.
   And at Chanel, where a standard woman's suit runs $3,000 and
some cost $18,000, regular customers continue to buy five or six a
year, said Trini Abellan, who has sold clothing at the boutique for
nearly six years.
   She says she has heard that some shops on Rodeo are hurting. But
Chanel remains a classic. ``For instance, last year I sold a
certain amount of millions. This year, I sold more.''
   Rodeo Drive has always been expensive. But over the past decade,
it's become less of a village center for locals and more a
playground for the wealthiest jet-setters on every continent, and a
huge attraction for tourists of every social strata.
   Alan Austin has run his women's clothing store just off Rodeo
for 26 years. He complains that foreign tourists care only about
labels, and only the top retail names in the world can afford to
rent space in places like Two Rodeo Drive.
   That's the brand-new $200 million development. Designed to look
like shops on a street in Europe, it increases the retail space on
Rodeo by 60 percent. Christian Dior, Valentino and Cartier have
moved in. The platinum, gold and diamond earrings in Tiffany &amp;
Co.'s window cost $123,000.
   Like Wardy, Austin began putting items on sale at Thanksgiving
because his inventory was so high. With the dollar weak, prices
have gone through the roof on his Italian and French clothing. That
has caused even wealthy locals to cut back on spending, unlike
during the last recession, he said.

   The deceptively alert-looking ``eyes-open
unconciousness'' that envelops Nancy Cruzan and perhaps 10,000
other Americans is difficult for families of the patients to
accept.
   In the condition, called persistent vegetative state, the eyes
move about and sometimes react to sound. Patients may grimace,
smack their lips and seem to smile. They sleep and wake up.
   But these are simply reflexes. The patients have permanent brain
damage that prevents consciousness.
   ``They're just as unconscious as patients in a coma,'' in which
eyes are closed and the patient cannot be aroused, said Dr. Ron
Cranford, an expert on persistent vegetative states.
   ``It looks like they're perfectly normal ... So it's very hard
on the family and health care providers to accept the fact that
they're not there.''
   It takes months or years for a family to come to terms with that
and the lack of hope for recovery, said Cranford, a neurologist at
the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.
   A vegetative state is called persistent if there is no hope of
recovery. A person may still recover fully after six months to a
year in a vegetative state if it was caused by a head injury,
especially in children, Cranford said.
   But if the patient suffered loss of blood or oxygen to the
brain, as Cruzan did, recovery can be ruled out after one to three
months, he said.
   Cruzan's condition has persisted since a 1983 auto accident.
Last Friday, her feeding tube was removed after a lengthy court
battle. Doctors said she would die from dehydration within a week
or two of the tube's removal.
   ``She's not in pain, she's not suffering in any way,'' because
the brain centers that would let her perceive pain and suffering
are destroyed, said Cranford, who has examined her.
   In her last two to three days, she will go into a coma, and then
``she'll die a quiet, peaceful death,'' he said.
   If death is inevitable in such cases, why not give a lethal
injection and get it over with, sparing the family a long death
watch?
   That is homicide, notes Robert Veatch, director of the Kennedy
Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University. The question of
legalization will draw ``much more serious debate'' in the coming
decade, he said.
   One argument against legalization suggests that if it is allowed
for a clear-cut case, it will then be allowed later for more shaky
cases so that ``all sorts of people are getting killed that
shouldn't be,'' he said.
   That fear is ``at least worth worrying about,'' Veatch said.
   Another argument is the idea that it's simply wrong to kill in
these situations, even if it is ethically acceptable to let
somebody die, he said.
   Many people may have a gut feeling that there is a difference,
he said, but it is not clear whether that reaction occurs because
there really is a difference, or because people have been taught
all their lives that there is one, he said.
   That question will be debated in upcoming years, but for now,
``I think the difference is worthy of very serious consideration,''
Veatch said.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, said he sees no ethical reason to
hasten Cruzan's death for the sake of others.
   ``No one said that death is supposed to be easy on other
people,'' he said.

   Bud Stanley's front yard is decorated like
a desert this holiday season - the Saudi Arabian desert, to be
exact.
   While neighbors put Santa Claus on the roof and a nativity scene
or menorah in the front yard, Stanley created a Desert Shield
Christmas to honor the men and women stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   Stanley's yard is in Tulare, about 50 miles south of Fresno in
central California. It has holiday lights, reindeer and other
traditional decorations. But they're scattered among sand dunes,
palm trees, a camouflaged Jeep and military pup tents - even
fatigues hanging on a line.
   And, of course, a jet.
   An actual A-4 jet loaned by nearby Lemoore Naval Air Station is
the finishing touch on Stanley's holiday tribute to the soldiers
involved in Desert Shield. Stanley has even created a
realistic-looking runway, complete with blinking blue running
lights.
   ``It turned out pretty good,'' said the 20-year-old, who has
created extravagant displays every Christmas since 1986. ``But I
didn't expect it to go this far, frankly.''
   Stanley, who lives with his parents, helps run the family's
chain of convenience stores. He said he did the display to honor
soldiers taking part in Desert Shield, especially his friend, Corey
Kuykendall, on active duty with a tank division in Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's to show the men and women out there that we love them,''
he said. ``We want them to have a good Christmas.''
   Stanley began working on the display the day after Thanksgiving
and put in over 150 hours before it was complete.
   ``Once the idea of a display in honor of the troops in Saudi
Arabia was decided upon, the display took off,'' Stanley said in a
telephone interview. The chief of police told him about a sergeant
who wanted to loan him pup tents and other military regalia.
   ``He asked me if I wanted an A-4 fighter and I said `No way!',''
Stanley recalled. ``It really blew my mind.''
   Navy officials loaned a stripped-down fighter jet frequently
used for parade floats.
   ``I think it was a good thing to do,'' said Lemoore spokesman
Dennis McGrath. ``We thought about Desert Shield and it being
Christmas season, we decided: What the heck, let's do it.''
   McGrath said the jet's engine and hydraulic system were pulled,
and the only real concern was security. Police officers in this San
Joaquin Valley community 150 miles north of Los Angeles agreed to
keep a constant watch over the jet.
   By the end of the season, the display will cost Stanley between
$1,000 and $1,500 in electricity bills alone. However, all the
equipment and displays are on loan. Even the full team of reindeer
was donated by an archery club.
   Out of the roughly 1,000 people who visit the display ever
night, several stop to thank him.
   ``We have had some ladies and men drop by to tell us that they
have a husband or wife over there, and they thank us,'' he said.
``But this is all to thank them.''

   Could something as simple as books and pamphlets
about the lifestyles of ordinary Japanese help solve Japan's image
problem in the United States?
   Japanese officials say they sure hope so, and they're putting
money on it.
   The government, at the urging of former Foreign Minister
Shintaro Abe, is setting up a $370 million fund for public
relations and joint U.S.-Japanese research on common problems.
   Foreign Ministry officials say the effort is necessary, given
polls showing that Americans view Japan as a serious economic
threat.
   Abe, a senior legislator of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party, proposed the Japan-U.S. Global Partnership Fund in June
during a visit to Washington. The idea was later endorsed by Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   ``American people feel the Japanese are always very efficient,
that they band together among themselves and their only goal is to
make profits,'' said a Foreign Ministry official on condition of
anonymity.
   ``But we share many problems in common, such as educating our
kids and the aging of our societies. If there are many
opportunities for Americans to get acquainted, Japanese will look
more human,'' he said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said the fund was set
up in response to ``apprehension about deterioration of trust
because of a lack of communication efforts.''
   It's a slightly more pragmatic approach to an old problem first
dealt with in 1972, when the government set up the Japan
Foundation.
   That semi-governmental institution has supported worldwide
teaching and student exchanges as well as research on Japan, but
has done little to educate the non-academic community in the United
States, the Foreign Ministry official said.
   ``The relations between our two countries have outgrown the
realm of scholarship. These days, even Americans who don't study
Japan have to know about it because of the size of our economy,''
he said.
   In a supplementary national budget approved Monday, The Global
Partnership Fund received $300 million directly from the government
and another $74.6 million from the Japan Foundation. Its
expenditures will be limited to interest earned on the capital, or
about $25 million to $30 million a year.
   That money will be used to provide U.S. universities and public
libraries with publications aimed at explaining the Japanese
people. It also will fund think tanks for joint research on common
problems, including environmental issues and aging in both
societies, the official said.
   The fund is the latest in a series of moves indicating growing
dissatisfaction among Japanese officials with their image overseas.
   Last week, two other influential Liberal Democrats flew to the
United States seeking to calm anger among black leaders over a
comment by Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama comparing American
blacks to prostitutes in Japan who ``ruin the atmosphere of
neighborhoods they move into.''
   In recent years, the Foreign Ministry also has tried to improve
Japan's relations with other Asian and Third World countries
through more cultural exchanges and educational programs.
   But Japanese propaganda efforts overseas frequently are met with
skepticism.
   ``Americans are tired of hearing that the real problem is they
don't have a deep understanding of Japan,'' says Robert M. Orr Jr.,
director of the Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto, western Japan.
   ``The Japanese idea is that if you disagree with them, then you
don't understand them.''

   Hippie icon Wavy Gravy was right when he
predicted recently that the 1990s will be like the 1960s ``turned
upside down and inside out,'' a survey of Stanford University
students suggests.
   Two Stanford anthropologists who have surveyed student attitudes
for 38 years predict that the 1990s may resemble the Vietnam War
era, with a rise in extremism on both ends of the political
spectrum.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if there was a fairly substantial form
of radicalism,'' said George Spindler, who, along with his wife,
Louise, has queried Stanford students each year since Harry Truman
was president.
   An upsurge in extreme right-wing views will occur because the
middle-class feels increasingly threatened by societal
uncertainties and minorities, the Spindlers say.
   Leftist extremism could rise from the threat of war in the
Middle East and the specter of recession, they said.
   The survey indicated increased tension among young adults and
middle-aged people. The survey, with 24 open-ended statements, was
given to students aged 17 to 45.
   From several hundred to 4,000 people have responded each year
since 1952.
   Different eras show marked changes in attitudes. In the 1950s, a
majority of respondents completed the statement ``the future
is...'' with ``rosy,'' or a similar positive word, the Spindlers
said.
   Today, most said the future is ``dismal'' or ``something to
worry about,'' they said.
   But black, Chicano and Asian respondents didn't seem as insecure
about the future as their white counterparts.
   George Spindler conceded the survey of of elite college students
may not fully reflect the views of average Americans.
   ``But university populations set the trend,'' he said. ``Then it
filters down and causes changes in other populations.''

   In this country where only one percent of the
population is Christian, Christmas is celebrated lavishly with
fancy dinners, hotel floor shows and, most importantly, the
exchanging of extravagant gifts.
   Christmas is a full-fledged festival here, largely because the
Japanese delight in exchanging gifts and are drawn to things
Western.
   As the holiday approaches, Christmas trees, poinsettias and
holly brighten shop windows, kids eagerly await presents and the
strains of familiar carols mingle with the chorus of Salvation Army
volunteers outside department stores.
   But for those of courting age, Noel means romance. Spending
Christmas Eve alone is the ultimate embarrassment, and efforts to
make the right impression can top $1,000.
   ``Do you know who you're spending Christmas Eve with?'' the
popular magazine ``Hot Dog'' asks its young male readers, before
providing detailed pointers on the right clothes, restaurant, hotel
and seduction techniques for the holiday.
   ``Although Dec. 24 is no different from any other of the 365
days of the year, it's even more important than your birthday,''
the magazine says. ``You've got to do very careful research into
what she's hoping for on Christmas...There's a mountain of things
to do.''
   Japanese begin making restaurant and hotel reservations for the
big night as early as April. Dinner shows with tabs starting at
$225 a person, popular hotels and tours to such places as Hawaii,
Guam and Southeast Asia fill up as soon as reservations open.
   Then there are the gifts.
   Department stores ring up 25 percent of their total annual sales
in December because of Christmas and the tradition of offering
year-end presents to express appreciation for favors.
   Annual sales of Christmas gifts total about $1.15 billion, about
half for toys.
   Another substantial chunk of Christmas sales are to denim-clad
college men, many of whom crowd beside ladies swathed in mink at
Tiffany's and other posh stores, looking for a coveted pendant or
ring for their sweethearts.
   A fashionable Christmas Eve - a gift worth at least $200, a day
at Tokyo's Disneyland, and dinner and a room at a nearby luxury
hotel - can cost about $1,000.
   Young bachelors typically moonlight, scrimp and sometimes go
into debt to pay for one evening's extravagance.
   ``Christmas Eve costs at the very least about ($530) and the man
has to pay for all of it. It's really hard,'' said one 23-year-old
photographer.
   The celebration mystifies some Japanese.
   ``The Obsession of a Christmas for Two,'' the weekly magazine
Asahi Journal called the phenomenon in a headline.
   ``Since when did Christmas become such a festival?'' radio
announcer Shoko Yoshida said in a commentary in the newspaper
Sankei Shimbun. ``Recently, `It's not the money that counts' has
changed to, `Money is everything.'''
   An accompanying cartoon shows three Santa Clauses around a sales
chart. ``I don't want to go to Japan,'' says one Santa. ``Japan's
disgusting,'' says another.
   The ostentatious Christmas Eve is a relatively new phenomenon in
Japan, where the holiday has long been a family affair.
   Since the end of World War II, Japanese families have celebrated
the holiday with a gift or two for each child, and a dinner of
roast chicken and an ornately decorated Christmas cake.
   ``When I was a kid, Christmas usually meant dad would come home
drunk, because it was bonus season,'' says one young father. ``Now
we celebrate it as a family, even though we aren't at all
Christian.''
   The government estimates this nation of 122 million people has
slightly more than a million Christians. Most other Japanese, 99
percent, practice both Buddhism and the indigenous Shinto religion.
   Japan's first Noel was about 400 years ago, when Christianity
arrived with Western missionaries and merchants. The religion was
unwelcome for almost three centuries, forcing believers to worship
in secret.
   Today, Japanese worship freely and growing numbers of young
non-Christians are attending Christmas Eve services, drawn by the
universal theme of peace and goodwill.

   About 200 American soldiers have
sought advice on how to avoid service in the Persian Gulf, and at
least 30 are applying for conscientious objector status, an
American counseling network says.
   But the U.S. military says the problem of soldiers not wanting
to face possible combat is ``minuscule'' considering the number of
those who are willing to go.
   The American group, which calls itself the Military Counseling
Network, has begun operating throughout Germany to advise U.S.
soldiers on their rights.
   They make contact with the GIs by handing out leaflets at the
U.S. bases in Germany that the soldiers are being deployed from,
said Andre Stoner, a member of the group.
   Stoner, 28, of Harrisonburg, Va., and his wife Cathy, 23, of
Lancaster, Pa., advise the soldiers and their families from their
home in Krastel, in the Hunsrueck region of Germany, about 90 miles
west of Frankfurt.
   Janice Hill, 32, of Philadelphia, does the same from her home in
Rottenburg, about 36 miles south of Stuttgart. And a Roman Catholic
priest, the Rev. Mike Baxter, counsels soldiers in the northern
port city of Bremen.
   ``We are a counseling group and advise the soldiers on how they
can legally apply for conscientious objector status,'' Stoner said.
``We don't tell them to desert or to do anything illegal.''
   He said the network, which is supported by church and peace
groups in the United States, had received about 200 telephone calls
from interested soldiers so far ``and at least 30 of them are in
the process of applying for conscientious objector status.''
   While some of the soldiers fit the traditional description of a
conscientious objector who has an abhorrence for war of any kind,
others do not, Stoner said.
   He said some of the soldiers were ``selective conscientious
objectors,'' meaning they would ordinarily be willing to fight to
protect freedom in the United States.
   ``But they say `I don't think this is a just war and I'm not
willing to fight to protect some oil sheik and George Bush's
political career,''' Stoner said.
   He said response had been so great that additional network
members were called in from the United States to help advise
soldiers. Baxter was among them.
   Baxter, 35, a priest with the Holy Cross order in Albany. N.Y.,
said he has been in Bremen just one week.
   ``I've been in contact over the phone with about 15 or 20 GIs.
I've ... really advised concretely seven or eight, and they are in
the process of applying for conscientious objector status,'' Baxter
said.
   Baxter, who describes himself as a Christian pacifist, said the
military was now requiring most soldiers being sent to Saudi Arabia
to wait until they reach the gulf before applying for conscientious
objector status.
   ``We're trying to submit the application here (in Germany) and
fix an agreement with the military that these people do not have to
handle weapons,'' Baxter said.
   Ms. Hill said she was also getting dozens of calls from soldiers
and their wives. She said some of the soldiers had already gone
AWOL, ``which is something we never advise anyone to do, because
it's a lousy life.''
   An Army spokesman in Heidelberg, Capt. Dee Jepson, said the Army
does not consider conscientious objection to be a big problem.
   ``The problem...is minuscule,'' he said.

   A set of rules for bell ringers issued in 1694
warned: ``All you that do intend to ring, you undertake a dangerous
thing.''
   Three centuries later, the British Medical Journal has
documented the truth of these words in an article that is a litany
of bell ringers' bruises and broken bones.
   Dr. A.C. Lamont, a pediatric radiologist, and Dr. N.J.M. London
of the Leicester Royal Infirmary surveyed injuries among church
bell ringers. There are about 40,000 in England, and they ring
bells from 3,000 towers each Sunday, at Easter and on Christmas.
   For the article, appearing Saturday, the doctors reviewed the
last six years of ``Ringing World'' magazine, looking for articles
on injuries and accidents. They advertised in the trade magazine
for ringers who had suffered mishaps, and sent questionnaires to 20
active bell towers, bringing a response from 221 ringers.
   The injuries identified included torn fingernails, fractures,
bruises, corneal abrasions, rope burns, extracted teeth,
lacerations, accidental near hangings, pulled muscles, ruptured
ligaments and heads caught in rope loops.
   Five deaths were counted.
   The doctors' survey indicated that about 724 injuries befall
ringers in the British Isles each year, half of which require first
aid or other medical attention.
   ``Many ringers who returned the questionnaires insisted that
ringing is very safe, but our results show that this view is rather
optimistic,'' the doctors wrote in the journal's Christmas issue.
   They added that pride may have prevented some bell ringers from
reporting injuries.
   Learning to control a bell takes time and practice, the article
notes. Pupils of pealing must develop coordination to strike the
bell in its proper place at varying speeds and intervals while
avoiding bodily damage, it said.
   Novices commonly fall prey to the most notorious hazard of bell
ringing: the ``high speed lift.'' This occurs, the doctors wrote,
when the bell's stay breaks, the bell goes out of balance and the
ringer who forgets to release the rope is whisked towards the
ceiling at a speed approaching 55 mph.
   One letter to the doctors described the harrowing moments after
a bell weighing about 1,000 pounds went over balance and the bell
ringer went with it.
   ``I could hear voices telling me to `Let Go, Let Go,' and all I
could think was I am not going to drop that far onto the cement
floor, so I kept going right to the top until my right hand hit the
hole and my head hit the ceiling,'' the ringer wrote.
   ``I had no choice but to let go,'' ending up with a bruised
elbow, black and blue hip and a `little finger that blew up like a
balloon.''
   Two children surveyed by the doctors had teeth knocked out by
wayward ropes. An 80-year-old ringer had a rope fall over his head,
tighten over his eyebrows and, on the upward swing, lacerated his
forehead and scalp. Only a quick twist of the head prevented a
full-scale scalping.

<HEAD>UPI, FNN Owner Says It Can't Repay $20.7 Million Loan</HEAD>

   Infotechnology Inc., owner of United Press
International and Financial News Network, says it could not repay a
$20.7 million loan that was called in early.
   The lenders, Security Pacific National Bank and MidLantic
National Bank, now have the right to foreclose on Infotechnology's
46 percent stock interest in FNN, a cable television network.
   The FNN stock was placed as collateral for the loan, which
originally was due next July. The banks did not say whether they
would exercise their foreclosure option. Security Pacific said in a
statement: ``The credit is in default and the banks have moved to
protect their interests.''
   An Infotechnology spokeswoman said Friday the company's lack of
cash made it impossible to pay the principal and interest on the
loan, which was called in by Los Angeles-based Security Pacific.
MidLantic is based in Laurel, N.J.
   The banks did not say why they called in the loan early.
   The Infotechnology spokeswoman, who asked not to be named, said
the company believes the banks will not foreclose on the loan. She
said Infotechnology would continue seeking buyers for its media
subsidiaries to raise cash.
   The development was the latest blow to Infotechnology, whose FNN
subsidiary reported a $72.5 million loss for its 1990 fiscal year.
UPI, a news wire service, reportedly has been losing as much as
$2.5 million a month.
   Last month, UPI union and management employees agreed to a 35
percent pay cut for 90 days to give the news service time to find a
buyer.
   UPI, founded in 1907 as United Press, has changed ownership
three times in eight years. FNN provides stock quotes, business and
financial news, and sports information on a cable TV network to
more than 35 million homes served by 3,500 in the United States and
Canada.
   Separately, Infotechnology said its stock would be removed from
the National Market System listing but will remain on the National
Association of Secrities Dealers listing.
   Infotechnology said NASD had approved an exception to filing
requirements. The exception relates to FNN's failure to meet
Securities and Exchange Commission net worth requirements, and to
late filing of its quarterly financial report for the period ending
Sept. 30.
   The NASD granted Infotechnology a filing extension until Jan.
15, a deadline the company said it expects to meet.

<HEAD>Ailing Pan Am Says It Wants to Accept TWA Buyout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pan Am and TWA, two of the oldest - and weakest
- airlines, neared agreement on a business marriage that would end
their longtime rivalry and change the cast of characters in a
deeply troubled industry.
   But Pan Am may have to seek bankruptcy protection anyway.
   Carl C. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airways, had proposed a
buyout of Pan Am Corp. last weekend in a deal worth about $375
million. Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett responded with a letter
Friday saying the deal could be ``advantageous to our shareholders,
employees and other constituencies.''
   But in a frank admission of Pan Am's critical money shortage,
Plaskett said Pan Am would need an infusion of cash before the
purchase could be completed.
   ``Under the circumstances, it would be futile to enter into a
transaction without any provision for bridge financing, especially
if TWA were not to commit to close the transaction regardless of
our financial situation,'' Plaskett said.
   Icahn sent a letter to TWA's employees saying he had been
considering ``the possibility of providing Pan Am with
debtor-in-possession financing. This is a type of financing which
might be possible if Pan Am decides to file a petition for
reorganization in bankruptcy.''
   In an interview published in today's New York Times, Icahn said
of a bridge loan: ``Even though it's going to be tough, I'm going
to make every effort I can.''
   Combining TWA and Pan Am would mark the end of independence for
Pan Am, which pioneered overseas air travel but has lost staggering
amounts of money over the past decade. It has survived by selling
itself in pieces.
   Earlier this year it agreed to sell London routes and some other
assets to United Airlines for $400 million.
   Icahn had written to Plaskett a letter dated Sunday that offered
to buy Pan Am's 150 million outstanding shares for $1.50 a share in
cash and $1 a share in either preferred stock or notes.
   ``In these extremely complicated and troubled times for the
airline industry, a combination of TWA and Pan Am might offer both
of us the opportunity to compete with the three major U.S.
airlines,'' Icahn wrote.
   The industry's three dominant players are American, United
Airlines and Delta Air Lines.
   Friday was the deadline for Pan Am to accept.
   In his responding letter, Plaskett asked Icahn to ``send us
promptly a detailed term sheet indicating among other things the
basis on which you would be willing to provide bridge financing,
precisely what you envision as conditions of closing, and the
specific terms of the securities you are proposing to offer.''
   Pan Am's letter, which didn't say how much cash was needed, was
released shortly after Standard &amp; Poor's issued a statement raising
the possibility that Pan Am would have to seek bankruptcy court
refuge if it couldn't raise cash.
   The airline industry is approaching record losses because of
fuel inflation incited by the Persian Gulf crisis and slackening
demand for air travel. Weak airlines such as Pan Am and TWA are
under the biggest strain.
   Icahn's offer for Pan Am came at the same time he announced
plans to sell all of TWA's London routes and some other assets to a
healthier rival, American Airlines, in a package worth $625
million.

   Ishak Mousa Husseini, a noted Palestinian
writer and teacher who sought to explain Arab history to the West,
has died, family members say. He was 86.
   Arab leaders including PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi have cabled condolences to the family of
Husseini, who died Tuesday at his home in Arab east Jerusalem and
was buried Wednesday, family members said.
   The cause of death was not dislosed.
   Husseini was the author of 22 books and numerous academic essays
during a teaching career that spanned more than four decades. He
taught at Jerusalem's Arabic College, the American University of
Beirut and the American University of Cairo.
   In 1982, he founded the Women's Art College, which is part of
Jerusalem University, and was its president until his death. His
fellow Palestinian writers in 1986 gave him the honorary title of
``dean of Palestinian literature.''
   An expert in Semitic languages, Husseini was a leading figure in
the Arabic linguistic academies in Egypt and Iraq. He often
lectured in Canada and the United States and sought to explain
Islam and Arab history to the West.
   Among his books is ``Moslem Brothers,'' a study on how
fundamentalism began to work its way into Islam.
   His best-known fiction work is ``Memoirs of Chicken,'' written
in 1943. It was considered controversial in the Arab world because
it criticized the low status given to Arab women.
   Husseini's eldest son, Hatam Husseini, a political science
lecturer at Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C., said Arafat wrote a
personal letter saying, ``I have a special love for him. ... His
death is a big loss.''
   Hrawi's message of condolence recalled his time as a student of
Husseini. Many of the elder Husseini's students went on to become
professors, ministers and diplomats, said Husseini's son.
   At least 3,000 people attended Husseini's funeral on Wednesday,
and many literary figures put special wreaths on his grave near
Jerusalem's Temple Mount, or Harem es-Sharif.
   Hatam Husseini said that as a memorial to his father, the family
will publish his complete body of work in English.
   He is survived by his wife, Alawieh, and three children.

   For more than 25 years, Ed Duncan has been
hearing bells. From tiny silver melody bells to the biggest, a
thunderous 22-pounder, he loves them all.
   Even the answering machine at Duncan's home has a message
telling callers they've reached the Wesley Bell Ringers, the
nation's largest handbell choir.
   It all began in 1963, when Duncan's pastor at the Christ United
Methodist Church asked him to establish a group to give the
congregation's teen-agers something to do.
   ``One day I was idly thumbing through a catalog of church
supplies and my eyes lit on this set of 25 bells you could buy,''
said Duncan, who plays organ and piano and teaches high school
physics.
   ``I thought it seemed like something the kids could do right off
the bat,'' he said.
   Over the years, the group has had as few as nine players to its
current 30, the numbers changing because Duncan never turns away a
potential player.
   ``That may be the thing I'm the most proud of, anybody can play
that wants to. They don't have to be musicians,'' he said.
   Duncan arranges nearly all of the music for the group and said
it's like scoring for three keyboard instruments and a percussion
ensemble. There are several octaves of bells, and at least three
sets are playing all the time.
   ``Each kid in the section has the same music, then we assign
them a certain number of bells and teach them where the notes are
located on the staff,'' he said.
   White-gloved, the bell-ringers perform in a complicated
choreography that produces a rich sound sometimes reminiscent of a
pipe organ.
   ``Spectacular!'' one listener was heard to say at a recent
performance.
   The group has played in every state of the union, including
performances at the U.S. Capitol, Disneyland and Disney World.
   Christmas programs are devoted mostly to carols, but the choir's
repertoire includes popular, sacred and classical music.
   Last year, the bell ringers were guests of the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir for a Christmas performance and recently were chosen to
perform at a convention of bell choir directors.
   ``I really can't say with certainty, but as nearly as I know
it's the biggest choir in sheer volume of bells and largest number
of people. So I keep saying it's the biggest,'' Duncan said. ``And
the bell manufacturers say its true.''
   For the players, the group has come to represent an important
bond with other members of their faith.
   Because of the Mormon Church's predominance in Utah, the group's
teen-agers someties are the only Methodists in their school, and
the choir offers a comforting sense of community.
   ``It's nice knowing you're not the only Methodist in town,''
said May Thomas, 19, who has played with the group for two years.
   Every summer, the group tours for five weeks. Fund-raisers and
proceeds from sales of their recordings help finance the trip.
Linda Gross, a parent volunteer who handles publicity, said the
church has a fund set aside to pay Duncan and help with the summer
tours, but he never takes the money.
   ``He pays his assistant a little and uses the rest is used for
scholarships to get everyone on tour,'' she said.
   Jerry Moore, 18, a four-year veteran, said the ties run so deep
between the players that he likens them to a big family.
   ``This definitely brings friends closer,'' he said. ``You become
lifelong friends.''

   People in the neighborhood where five children
were wounded by rivals in a drive-by shooting shrugged off the new
level of mayhem in the nation's capital with shakes of the head and
a what-can-you-do look in their eyes.
   ``That's the atmosphere around here,'' said a 28-year-old man
who moved to suburban Maryland five years ago but returned Friday
to visit his parents in the Shaw neighborhood.
   Even the classmates of four of the victims - the fifth was a
6-year-old girl - seemed to take the Thursday afternoon shootings
in stride, said a teacher at the imposing cinder-block Shaw Junior
High School.
   ``They look at it like, `It's just the neighborhood,''' said the
teacher, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's another day at
the office. No big deal.''
   There was no rush of counselors into classrooms to calm the
fears of students who must walk the same tough streets, said the
teacher, who seemed surprised when asked how the school was
reacting.
   In fact, he said, the students generally did not even mention
the shootings, and no special effort was made to draw them out.
   On Friday, three youths - one age 16 and two age 14 - were
charged in the shootings and police said they were looking for two
more 14-year-old suspects. Meanwhile, two of the victims, including
the 6-year-old girl, were released from Children's Hospital. The
three others remained hospitalized.
   Some of those contacted in the neighborhood Friday seemed as if
they were beyond shock over violence in this city of 625,000.
Police say the city has had a record 471 homicides this year, 30 of
them juveniles. In addition, 1,163 people have been wounded by
gunfire, 204 of them juveniles.
   A 30-year-old man who lives near the neighborhood said, ``I'm
very paranoid. I think that's what keeps me alive.''
   Yet he wouldn't think of moving to safer environs.
   ``I love it too much,'' he said. ``It's intriguing, a constant
mystery. To be here and survive here - it's a challenge.''
   Shaw, less than two miles from the White House, is one of the
city's poorest neighborhoods, but an economic upturn is expected
next year when a subway station opens in the area.
   Today, the area where the shootings occurred is a mixture of
single-family row houses - some with small but carefully manicured
yards and Christmas decorations - houses subdivided into apartments
and boarded-up buildings. A baseball field and a playground are
nearby.
   Thursday's shootings resulted not from a random act of violence
but from an altercation a week or so ago between two loosely
organized groups of young people, Police Chief Isaac Fulwood said.
   ``I don't know whether it was drug-related or not, but I doubt
it,'' Fulwood said angrily. ``Don't make everything drug-related;
it cheapens the violence.''
   In the old days, he said, the dispute could have been settled
with a simple fist fight. He blamed the escalation on easy access
to guns, pervasive violence on television and a breakdown in
parental inculcation of values in children.
   The chief said he has spoken to young people about shootings and
has found they show ``no remorse, not the first tear. There's no
sense that there's anything wrong.''
   The attack about 3 p.m. Thursday involved multiple gunshots by
assailants in a car passing by the victims. None of the weapons was
immediately recovered, Fulwood said.
   The names of those arrested were not released because of their
ages, and Fulwood said no decision had been made on whether to try
any as adults. Three were arraigned Friday in juvenile court.
   Xaziver Paul, 6, and Troy Gray, 15, were discharged from
Children's Hospital on Friday, spokeswoman Barbara Cire said. Brian
Lewis, 12, was listed in good condition. John Olden, 13, and
Clarence Richmond, 14, were upgraded from serious to fair
condition.

<HEAD>U.S. Suspends Military Aid to Guatemala</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angered by slow progress in an investigation
of the death of an American innkeeper, the State Department is
suspending its $2.8 million military aid program to Guatemala.
   The action announced Friday stemmed from the death June 8 of
Michael DeVine, 49, originally of Belleville, Ill., who lived in
Guatemala for almost 20 years. At the time of his death, he was
operating a hotel-restaurant in the northern part of the country.
   DeVine's body was found at the side of a road, his head partly
severed and his hands tied behind his back. A private investigator
reportedly has uncovered evidence pointing to involvement by a
local Guatemalan Army unit.
   ``We have concluded that it would not be appropriate to continue
a normal military assistance relationship with Guatemala at this
time,'' a State Department statement said.
   It noted that the Guatemalan government ``rarely takes action to
thoroughly investigate'' violators of human rights.
   It also expressed ``deep disappointment with the lack of
commitment of the government of Guatemala to protect human
rights.''
   As an example, it cited the killing on Dec. 2 of 14 civilians in
Atitlan province and the wounding of 19 others. Two servicemen were
arrested and are still in custody.
   Officials in Guatemala City had little immediate comment on the
announcement.
   President Vinicio Cerezo told reporters only that ``the
government will make known its position at the appropriate time.''
   Guatemala refused U.S. military aid in 1977 rather than accept
the human rights conditions that were attached. The assistance
gradually resumed in the mid-1980s.
   As for the DeVine case, State Department officials said U.S.
diplomats pressed the Guatemalan government over a period of months
to complete the investigation before Cerezo turns power over to an
elected successor next month. But they said the investigation is at
a standstill.
   The officials, who requested anonymity, said Guatemalan
authorities have not acted on two outstanding arrest warrants.
   The authorities also have refused, despite U.S. requests, to
question the former zone commander at the military base near the
area where DeVine was killed as well as the former head of
intelligence at the base.
   The U.S. officials said they are not certain as to the motives
for DeVine's killing. Cerezo has acknowledged that the security
forces could have been responsible for DeVine's death.

<TEXT>
   An extensive Western review of the Soviet
economy maps a bold strategy for a break with 70 years of
government control, but whether Mikhail Gorbachev can carry out the
reforms is very much an open question.
   The study, commissioned by the leaders of the United States and
six other Western powers, called for Soviet citizens, already
suffering from shortages of food and other basic goods, to accept
even more economic pain in the short term.
   It prescribed such bitter economic medicine as the removal of
price controls on basic commodities while at the same time imposing
wage controls on workers.
   The study, prepared by the International Monetary Fund and three
other Western economic organizations, conceded that unemployment
would rise in the short term and economic output, which is already
plummeting, would fall further as inefficient industries are phased
out.
   However, it said only a cold-turkey approach to reform, similar
to the methods being used in Poland, would work in the Soviet
Union.
   ``The imperative is to make sufficient progress at the beginning
so that reform is seen as an irreversible break with the past and
the process gains an unstoppable momentum,'' the study said.
   But Western experts noted that even the Warsaw government has
had trouble selling its austerity program, with Poles expressing
their unhappiness in recent national elections. And Gorbachev does
not start with the same base of popular support that the Solidarity
movement had in Poland.
   Indeed, the Soviet president is having to battle with 15 restive
republics who are tired of the central government botching the
country's economy and want more freedom to try their own formulas.
   Still, U.S. analysts were optimistic the Soviets eventually will
be able to embark on the radical reform proposed by the study,
which was begun last July at the direction of President Bush and
the leaders of Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   Ed Hewett, a Soviet specialist at the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based research organization, said that while the odds
were low that the proposed reforms could be implemented
immediately, he would not rule out the chances that such changes
could take hold within the next year.
   Hewett suggested it may take a true coalition government
spanning the political spectrum with strong representation from the
republics to push such a measure through.
   ``While it may seem difficult to see how such a program could be
implemented now, politics in the Soviet Union is moving very fast
and six months is a long time in Soviet politics,'' he said.
   The 50-page report supported Bush's contention that large
amounts of direct Western aid should not be provided to the Soviets
until they begin implementing more fundamental reforms of their
economy.
   In the short term, the report said, Western countries should
emphasize providing technical assistance to the Soviets in such
areas as banking, law and transportation.
   It also said that targeted aid to help the Soviets with
environmental problems and the modernization of their energy
production system would be useful.
   ``The general recommendations of the report are recommendations
that the United States will support and subscribe to,'' Secretary
of State James A. Baker said. His comment indicated that the
document is likely to form the blueprint for Western assistance to
the Soviets in the next year.
   The study was ordered at the Houston summit in an effort to
break a deadlock between French and German leaders who were pushing
for an immediate $15 billion aid package and the reluctance of Bush
and others to go along with that proposal.
   The study said that without the implementation of a major and
far-reaching reform program, direct Western aid would be ``of
little or no lasting value.'' But it held out the promise that once
the reforms were implemented, such aid would be forthcoming.
   The report was prepared by the 154-nation International Monetary
Fund and its sister organization, the World Bank; the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.

   Here in brief are the principal economic
recommendations made Friday by the International Monetary Fund and
three other organizations in a report on reforming the Soviet
economy.
   PRICES: Controls on prices must be removed quickly on many
products in an effort to end shortages. For certain key
commodities, the movement to market prices may need to be phased in
over three years.
   WAGES: In order to insure that the initial spurt of prices does
not trigger inflationary wage demands, wages should be controlled
``in the early stages'' of price decontrol. However, the wage
policy should provide a floor as well as a ceiling on employee
wages.
   MONEY: Interest rates should be raised, controls on bank credits
to enterprises must be enforced and banks should have to hold a
fraction of deposits as reserves on deposit with the central bank.
   PRIVATE OWNERSHIP: Small firms should be privatized quickly
``through outright sales to infividuals, cooperatives and others.''
Larger state-owned companies should have commercially oriented
management with slower privatization, perhaps through conversion of
enterprises into joint stock companies, owned by one of several
state holding companies, or owned through mutual funds.
   SOCIAL SAFETY NET: Policies are needed to deal with the rising
unemployment that will occur as inefficient businesses are phased
out and also provide protection for low-income earners to
compensate for the rising inflation once prices are decontrolled.

   An unannounced test-firing of an Israeli
missile sent American forces in the Persian Gulf area briefly
scrambling into a heightened state of alert, Pentagon sources say.
   The U.S. action Friday was a precaution against the possibility
that Israel might have been launching a preemptive strike against
Iraq, said one source, who like others spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Israel has been known to do preemptive strikes before,'' the
source said, referring to Israel's 1981 bombing of an Iraqi nuclear
plant.
   The 280,000 U.S. troops in the gulf area were put on heightened
alert after U.S. intelligence sources detected the Israeli missile
being fired and before it was clear the weapon was heading into the
Mediterranean, the sources said. The alert lasted only a short
time, they said.
   Israel feels threatened by Iraq's increasingly sophisticated
ballistic missile capability, hich raises the possibility of a
chemical weapons attack on Israel, especially if the U.S.-led
multinational force in the gulf attacks Iraq.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Safety experts are projecting between 380 and 480
traffic deaths during the four-day Christmas holiday.
   The National Safety Council each year estimates the number of
holiday traffic fatalities for the heavily traveled holiday period,
which began at 6 p.m. Friday and ends 11:59 p.m. Tuesday.
   Last year, 372 people died during the three-day Christmas
holiday.
   This year's projection is higher because Christmas falls on a
Tuesday, extending the holiday period another day, council
statistician Terry Miller said.
   Safety officials say the death toll could be lower than in
previous four-day Christmas periods because high gasoline prices
may deter people from making long car trips or hopping from social
event to event.
   ``People may just decide to limit their driving to necessary
errands, going to the store and other things of that nature,''
Miller said. ``But it's hard to predict people's behavior in such
situations.''
   The council makes its projections by comparing the average
number of traffic deaths each day this year with historical figures
on traffic fatalities during past holiday seasons.
   The council also projects that between 350 and 450 people will
die during the four-day New Year holiday period.

   Jerry Winters built a candy empire, door by
door. In the mid-1980s, teens were selling his chocolate in 33
states. He was making over $30 million a year. A business magazine
named him ``Entrepreneur of the Year.''
   But reality was a long way from sugar and spice for the
``Candyman,'' convicted Friday on five counts of racketeering,
extortion and interstate fraud. Two associates were also convicted
of racketeering and extortion. Six others were acquitted.
   Prosecutors portrayed Winters as a hot-tempered tyrant whose
secrets to success included baseball bat beatings and torched
delivery vans. U.S. District Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry,
noting his penchant for violence and use of aliases, denied a
request for house arrest.
   The millionaire will spend the holidays in jail.
   ``This was, in a nutshell, a case of violence and threatened
violence for the sake of a buck,'' said Barry, pointing at Winters'
history of ordering beatings for some employees and competitors.
   After eight days of deliberations, the jury convicted Winters of
two counts of federal racketeering, two counts of extortion and one
count of interstate fraud. He faces up to 80 years in prison when
he is sentenced in February.
   Winters, who did not testify, agreed to forfeit to the
government $650,000 he obtained by racketeering.
   Before the jury filed in the courtroom with the verdicts, the
heavyset Winters stood in an aisle, locked embracing his wife,
Maureen. He sat impassively as the guilty verdicts were read.
   About 50 witnesses took the stand in the seven-week trial. Many
testified that Winters' business skills included violence, threats
and arson to stay atop the door-to-door candy sales industry.
   Winters' organization pulled in an estimated $32 million a year,
with agents in 33 states, from Washington to New York.
   He and his agents made their money by recruiting teens to sell
candy under such names as ``Student Aid Program,'' ``Inner City
Youth Corps,'' ``Midwestern Youth Opportunities,'' and ``Fund
Raiser Products Inc.'' All the groups operated strictly for profit.
   Winters, of Norwood, was named Entrepreneur of the Year by
Venture Magazine, and New Jersey Monthly Magazine cited his
organization as one of the 10 best places to work in the state.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Victory Ashrafi presented a bleaker
story. Jurors were told of several cases in which Winters beat
employees and competitors into submission for selling rival candy
or infringing on his territory.
   Defense attorney Bruce Cutler told jurors that Winters was a
churchgoing pillar of the community, who rose from poverty by
selling his grandmother's fudge door to door.
   Cutler did not return calls Friday from New York, where he was
representing reputed mob boss John Gotti in a hearing in federal
court.
   Also convicted were Paul Ray, 35, of Texas, and Darrin Casper,
24, of Virginia.
   Ray was convicted of one count of racketeering and faces up to
20 years in prison. Casper was convicted of one count each of
extortion and interstate racketeering and faces a prison term of up
to 25 years.
   There was enthusiastic backthumping among the acquitted
defendants: Anthony Allen, 24, of Passaic; Ralph Vilchez, 37, of
North Bergen; Kevin Miller, 38, of Tappan, N.Y.; James Martin, 41,
and Ronald Barks, 38, both of California; and Andrew Hanna, 37, of
Las Vegas.

   John Gotti, accused of ordering the murder of
another reputed mobster to seize control of the country's largest
crime syndicate, will spend Christmas in jail after being denied
bail.
   U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser of Brooklyn decided against
bail after a three-hour hearing Friday that was closed to the
public and the press.
   At the hearing, prosecutors played tapes that secretly recorded
conversations held in Gotti's Little Italy hangout, the Ravenite
social club.
   Prosecutors maintain the tapes prove Gotti is a threat to
potential witnesses and he and two co-defendants should be held
without bail.
   The three men - Gotti, 50, alleged underboss Frank Locascio, 58,
and reputed mob counselor Salvatore Gravano, 45 - have been jailed
without bail since Dec. 11, when federal agents arrested them on
racketeering charges including allegations Gotti engineered the
killings of mob rivals.
   Law enforcers described the trio as the top leadership of the
Gambino crime family. Prosecutors claim Gotti ordered the murder of
his predecessor, Paul Castellano, to take over the Gambino family.
   The next hearing in the case was set for Jan. 18.
   Gotti has two nicknames: the Dapper Don and the Teflon Don, the
first a reference to his natty wardrobe and the second to his three
acquittals in the past five years.
   On Friday he wore a charcoal suit with a bright red, green and
black floral-print tie.
   Speaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Gotti's lawyer,
Bruce Cutler, said his client was disappointed by the ruling, but
not surprised.
   ``It's the same menu in a different restaurant,'' Cutler said,
referring to the latest effort to prosecute Gotti.
   Glasser closed the bail hearing after ruling the defendants'
right to a free trial overrides the right of the press and the
public to observe the proceedings. He reopened the courtroom to
announce his decision to deny bail.

   Nancy Cruzan's father and
anti-euthanasia demonstrators exchanged sympathetic words on the
steps of a hospital where the brain-injured woman lies dying.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge Friday criticized activists who want
state health officials to restore a feeding tube removed from Nancy
Cruzan last week.
   The action was the latest in a series of petitions denied since
food and water were withdrawn Dec. 14 from Ms. Cruzan, who has been
in a persistent vegetative state for nearly eight years.
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan obtained court permission to have the tube
removed after providing testimony that their daughter would not
want to live in her present condition.
   ``I guess I'm very concerned about you people being out here,
particularly the young people,'' Cruzan told about a dozen people
bundled in parkas, caps and mittens in 15-degree weather. The
demonstrators have been holding a round-the-clock vigil.
   Cruzan came bearing a peace offering. He gave a coffee maker to
David Hall of Fort Worth, Texas, director of a right-to-life group.
   ``Our prayers are with you,'' Hall said Friday, fighting back
tears. ``It's a very tough time, but we don't begin to think we
could understand or go through what you have gone through. We're
standing out here praying and doing all that we can do in a way
that we feel God would have us do.''
   ``And we are doing the same,'' said Cruzan, a 55-year-old
construction worker. ``We are doing what we feel God has directed
us to do, and that is to carry out what we believe. We believe we
are in the best position to know what would be Nancy's wishes.''
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, has been in a vegetative state since a car crash
nearly eight years ago. Doctors are convinced she will not recover.
She was expected to die within two weeks of the tube removal and
was in deteriorating condition today.
   Demonstrators have pitched two tents on the lawn of the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center, drawing power from the building for their
heaters and coffee pots. They planned to sleep there and in nearby
cars, despite a prediction of up to 5 inches of snow and minus-30
wind chill overnight.
   Nineteen people were arrested Tuesday after they burst into the
hospital and tried to reach Ms. Cruzan's room to reconnect her
feeding tube. Five of the arrested demonstrators have been released
on bond. The others vow to remain in custody until she is fed or
dies.
   In the ruling issued Friday in Kansas City, U.S. District Judge
Dean Whipple criticized protesters for going from court to court,
seeking an order to restore the feeding tube.
   ``This court is mindful of the fact that this is the fifth
petition of its kind filed this week in various Missouri courts -
the previous four petitions having been dismissed,'' the ruling
said.
   ``In light of the history of this case, this court finds that
any further action would be frivolous at best, and an abuse of the
legal process,'' the ruling said.
   The judge had set a hearing Friday on the petition filed by
members of Operation Rescue, a nationwide anti-abortion group. But
Whipple canceled the hearing and issued the written ruling instead.
   Court employees said the judge had been besieged by more than
2,000 phone calls by people asking him to intervene.
   On Friday morning the Missouri Supreme Court denied a second
request that it order Ms. Cruzan's feeding tube restored. The high
court and a Missouri appeals court on Thursday turned down similar
requests.

<HEAD>Ohio Governor Grants Clemency to 25 Women Prisoners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prison doors will open soon for 25 women
convicted of crimes, including murder, that out-going Gov. Richard
Celeste says were committed while the women suffered physical or
emotional abuse.
   Celeste said Friday he granted clemency after studying 105 cases
in which ``battered woman syndrome'' was a suspected factor.
   The governor acted after the Ohio Supreme Court and the
Legislature established the syndrome as a defense against murder or
other crimes. That defense was not available at the time to the
women Celeste plans to free.
   Celeste, who leaves office Jan. 14, included a stipulation that
the released inmates must perform 200 hours of community service in
domestic violence programs. Paperwork and other red tape probably
will mean that the women will not be released until after
Christmas, he said.
   Most of the inmates were convicted of serious crimes including
murder, manslaughter and assault.
   In four of the 25 cases, the women have served less than two
years for the crimes they committed. Celeste stipulated that they
must serve at least two years before their release.
   Celeste told a news conference that of the cases he reviewed, 32
were sent back to the state Parole Board for further review and 48
were rejected.
   He said about 15 other cases remained under review, and that he
would announce his decisions in those cases in January.
   Celeste said Ohio became the last state to recognize the plight
of battered women when the Ohio Supreme Court in March ruled that
evidence of battered woman syndrome is permissible at trials.
   In those situations, he said women face physical or
psychological abuse, frequently repeated and intensified,
``resulting in feelings of guilt ... a sense of isolation, and
finally must submit to violence.''
   After the Ohio Supreme Court ruling, the state Legislature
enacted a law allowing evidence of battered woman syndrome to be
used as a defense.
   Some of Celeste's decisions ran counter to recommendations of
the parole board. But he said he read each case at least twice and
consulted with court and other officials before becoming convinced
that they were victims.
   Celeste said the parole board does not cite what criteria it
uses in its decisions.

   Germany's state governors have decided not to
limit immigration by Jewish refugees from the Soviet Union who have
been streaming into the old capital of the Third Reich in search of
a home.
   ``We are moved by the trust that the Soviet Jews are showing
toward Germany, where horrible things happened to Jews in the
past,'' Gerhard Schroeder, the governor of Lower Saxony, said after
the decision in Munich Friday.
   About 1,000 Soviet Jewish refugees have arrived this month in
Berlin, the first major German city along the rail lines from the
east. As many as 4,000 Soviet Jews are believed to have arrived in
Germany this year.
   Officials reported a surge in the emigration of Jews toward
Germany this week because of worries that th 16 governors meeting
in Munich might set a quota on the number of Jews who could settle
in Germany.
   Another factor in the Soviet emigration is fear that growing
political tensions and economic hardships will lead to pogroms, as
has occurred in Russia's past. Vocal anti-Semitism is on the rise
in the Soviet Union.
   The governors decided not to establish any limits on Jewish
immigration. Under the current rules, a Soviet visa is practically
all that Jews need to move to Germany.
   Bavaria spokesman Wolf-Dieter Remmele said the governors
``expressed their basic willingness to accept the Soviet Jews,
without any specific numbers being named.''
   ``By all means, we will care for them,'' Schroeder said at a
news conference in Munich.
   Jewish leaders in Germany have been urging a liberal acceptance
policy, citing the nation's historical responsibility because of
the Nazi murder of 6 million Jews.
   Under the current practice, Soviet Jews arriving in Berlin are
guided to a counseling center, where authorities, after making sure
they are Jewish, give them an orientation and house them at
emergency shelters.
   After temporary stays in Berlin, the Jews are resettled in other
parts of the country.

   For the first time in eight years, Arab
nations let the General Assembly recess its autumn session without
making their annual effort to kick Israel out of the U.N. body.
   The Arabs apparently decided that challenging Israeli membership
would have complicated the delicate diplomatic arrangements related
to the Persian Gulf crisis, U.N. officials said Friday, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   At Washington's urging, Israel has refrained from direct
involvement in the crisis, while the United States accommodated its
Arab allies in the anti-Iraq alliance by supporting three Security
Council resolutions critical of Israel.
   On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a
referendum urging Israel to halt deportation of Palestinians from
the occupied West Bank and Gaza. It also calls on the United
Nations to monitor the safety of Palestinians there.
   The vote was sharply denounced by Israeli officials and Jewish
organizations in the United States; Iraq and the Palestine
Liberation Organization said the resolution did not go far enough.
   But it won the approval of Egypt and Syria, two Arab states that
have troops in the U.S.-led multinational alliance pitted against
Iraq.
   Since 1982, Arab nations have made an annual attempt to oust
Israel by challenging its right to sit in the General Assembly
among other ``peace-loving states.''
   This year, the Arabs had planned to introduce a motion that
Israel's U.N. credentials be accepted so long as the Jewish state
does not represent ``Palestinian and other Arab territories
occupied by Israel since 1967.''
   Those areas, according to the amendment, include Jerusalem, the
West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights.
   But none of the Arab delegations introduced the measure before
the assembly recessed for the holiday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said.
   Israel captured Arab east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Arab-Israeli War, and has annexed it. Israel claims Jerusalem as
its capital, and says it will never give the city up. It has also
occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1967.
   Most countries reject Israel's claim on Jerusalem, pointing to a
1948 General Assembly plan that would have made Jerusalem an
international city and established two countries, Israel and
Palestine.

   Lint, hair and even part of a peanut
were found clogging an air filter designed to help cool two
computers that failed on the shuttle Columbia's last mission.
   The clogged debris caused the two monitors to overheat, forcing
the space agency to control the shuttle's $15 million Astro space
observatory primarily from the ground, NASA spokeswoman Patricia
Phillips said Friday.
   The debris appeared to be only partially responsible, however,
Phillips said. Engineers from Kennedy and Marshall Space Flight
centers determined that some components in an electrical circuit
had failed also.
   Within hours after the Dec. 2 launch, astronauts smelled
something hot and shut down the first computer and switched to a
backup. Days later, the telltale odor reappeared and the crew shut
down the second computer.
   The electronics are 7 to 9 years old and have a history of
trouble, Phillips said. Marshall scientists had begun to redesign
them even before their failure during the Columbia mission.
   New electronics will be ready by the time space shuttle Atlantis
flies next in April 1992, she said.

<HEAD>Buchwald Says `Coming to America' Ruling is Gift to Hollywood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a decision that may help unravel the
mystery of Hollywood studio financing, a judge has ruled Paramount
Pictures used an ``unconscionable'' formula to deny Art Buchwald
royalties for the blockbuster film ``Coming to America.''
   Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider said Friday that Buchwald,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist and author, and his
producing partner deserve a fair share of the net profits from the
Eddie Murphy film. The judge ruled that the studio used an
``unconscionable'' formula for computing the net.
   The judge had ruled earlier that Buchwald's 1982 script
treatment, ``King for a Day,'' submitted to Paramount, formed the
basis for ``Coming to America.''
   Paramount and Murphy had denied there was any similarity and the
studio refused to honor its agreement with Buchwald and producer
Alain Bernheim.
   Buchwald hailed the ruling against accounting practices by
Paramount as a Christmas gift to Hollywood's creative community
while the studio denounced it as a blow to the free market system.
   The studio also maintained the movie, which grossed some $360
million, never produced any net profits.
   ``The court concludes that the ... provisions of Paramount's net
profit formula are unconscionable,'' Schneider said in the 36-page
written decision.
   He ordered a third phase of the trial to be held next year to
determine the exact amount of damages due to Buchwald and Bernheim
from Paramount.
   Attorney Pierce O'Donnell, who represents Buchwald and Bernheim,
said he expects a multimillion dollar award. In court papers,
Buchwald and Bernheim said they were entitled to royalties of up to
$14.6 million.
   ``This may be the dawn of a new era of leveling the playing
field in Hollywood,'' O'Donnell said.
   An excited Buchwald said from his Washington, D.C. home that he
felt the judge's decision would spur change.
   ``They haven't been challenged for a long time on how they keep
their books,'' Buchwald said. ``Now they're going to get a lot of
lawsuits.''
   Paramount lawyer Charles Diamond suggested the decision would
have no impact on studio accounting and that the studio would
prevail on appeal, which has not yet been filed.
   Paramount issued a statement denouncing Schneider's decision
saying, ``The decision is a threat to the free market system.''
   Among Paramount's financial practices singled out as unfair were
excessive overhead and interest fees charged to film costs.
   ``Paramount's charge of a flat 15 percent for overhead yields
huge profits even though the overhead charges do not even remotely
correspond to the actual costs incurred by Paramount,'' the judge
said.
   Diamond said Schneider was trying to rewrite Paramount's widely
accepted policy. It calls for the studio to recoup its costs for a
movie plus another 75 percent of that figure before it begins
sharing net profits with participants such as Buchwald and
Bernheim.
   Under their contract, Buchwald and Bernheim were entitled to up
to 40 percent of the film's net profits. After a lengthy period of
developing Buchwald's idea into a script, Paramount abandoned the
project in 1985. ``Coming to America'' came out the following year.
   Buchwald's 1982 synopsis involved a young member of royalty from
a mythical African kingdom who comes to the United States and is
deposed in his absence. He winds up in a Washington ghetto working
in a fast food restaurant where he meets and marries a young black
woman.
   In the Murphy movie, a prince from a mythical African kingdom
comes to New York in search of a bride, winds up in a ghetto
working in a fast food restaurant, meets a young black woman and
marries her.

   The White House wants to cut an additional
$18.7 billion from Medicare over the next five fiscal years.
   According to documents obtained Friday, that included $2.7
billion from the program in the next fiscal year in addition to the
nearly $6 billion agreed to in the deficit reduction package in
October.
   The extra cuts would come from payments to physicians and
hospitals in fiscal years 1992 through 1996.
   The $500 billion deficit-reduction package covered five fiscal
years, including the current one that began Oct. 1, and called for
trimming $42 billion from Medicare over the period.
   Medicare is spending about $110 billion this year to provide
health insurance to 33 million elderly and disabled Americans.
   The proposal is outlined in documents drawn up by the White
House Office of Management and Budget in response to the Department
of Health and Human Services' fiscal 1992 budget request. The
Associated Press obtained a copy of the documents.
   In February, President Bush will present his budget proposals to
Congress for the year that begins Oct. 1, 1991.
   Teaching hospitals would take the largest hit in OMB's
``pass-back'' plan. In the next fiscal year, payments to these
hospitals would be cut $1.5 billion, and over five years the toll
would be $9.3 billion.
   Reimbursements to physicians would be trimmed by $250 million
next fiscal year, with Congress choosing from among a list of
options.
   OMB also said it wants $5 million to establish a ``clearing
house'' that would keep track of employment-based or other private
health insurance. This would help HHS enforce a law requiring that
for a worker over 65 who is covered by health insurance through his
or her employer, the private insurance must be asked first to pay
the claim.
   In these cases, Medicare is the secondary payer, but often
patients don't disclose their private insurance and then Medicare
pays when it shouldn't.
   Under OMB's proposal, a line would be added to W-2 forms
requiring disclosure of health insurance coverage. These forms are
provided for every worker by their employer to the Internal Revenue
Service.

<HEAD>Bush Threatens Veto Over Budget Provision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says House Democrats are trying
to renege on the budget agreement adopted last fall and he will
veto any bill passed under a new House rule proposed by theDemocrats.
   If provisions of the agreement are rescinded, ``How can we
expect the agreement to be taken seriously?'' Bush asked in a
letter Friday to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   The issue is: Who estimates the dollar amount of certain
spending and tax proposals, the Office of Management and Budget -
an arm of the White House - or the Congressional Budget Office, a
part of Congress?
   The budget agreement provided that OMB would make the estimates,
but earlier this month the House Democratic Caucus voted
overwhelmingly to back a House rule under which lawmakers would
rely on estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office.
   The estimates must be made for proposed changes in so-called
``entitlement'' spending such as Medicare, or for tax changes.
Entitlement spending amounts to roughly half the budget.
   Under the agreement, anyone proposing a change in one of those
areas must propose an offset - either reduced spending in some
other entitlement program or a tax increase.
   The rule is to be considered on the first day of the new
congressional session, Jan. 3.
   ``In order to preserve the integrity of the budget agreement, I
urge you to prevent the adoption of any rule that would violate our
agreement,'' Bush wrote Foley.
   ``And in order to preserve confidence in that agreement, I must
advise you that I will veto any bill that contains language such as
that specified in the rule approved by the Democratic Caucus,'' he
said.

   A man lowered himself by rope down the Statue of
Liberty and was finally arrested when officers set up ropes of
their own and grabbed him about 40 feet off the ground.
   Mark Randall, 23, of New York City used a mountain climbing rope
Friday to descended nearly 50 feet from the statue's observation
deck, said Manny Strumpf, a National Parks Service spokesman.
   Three officers from the police department's Emergency Services
Unit sped to the scene in government boat. They lowered themselves
from the 90-foot-high observation area, grabbed Randall, cut his
ropes, and held onto him as the eased their way to the ground.
   Randall was charged with disorderly conduct and demonstrating
without a permit, Strumpf said.He was released after being given
two summonses.
   Randall told authorities he was demonstrating on behalf of
Indian activist Leonard Peltier, convicted in 1977 of killing two
FBI agents on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.
   The agents were killed in 1975 when they went to the reservation
to pick up a fugitive. Peltier has been in federal prison for the
past 14 years, serving dual life sentences.
   Randall, reached by telephone in his parents' Manhattan home,
said: ``I had a vision that told me to do this. As long as he
(Peltier) is in jail, I feel like I'm not free.''
   Randall is not an American Indian and said he has never met
Peltier.

<HEAD>Winter in Hong Kong Means It's Time For Snake Soup</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some people's idea of Yuletide fun is to watch
the waiter bite the head off a live viper and pluck out the
still-squirming serpent's bladder. The slippery green organ is then
eaten raw.
   Sure, not everyone will cotton to that bitter flavor, but they
say snake enhances sexual prowess, so what's not to like?
   For one thing, snakes may be threatened with extinction, Hong
Kong's government has declared.
   On Friday, the government adopted a law that requires snake
dealers to apply for import and export licences for king cobras,
Asiatic cobras and Oriental rat snakes. Failure to comply could
bring fines of up to $3,200 and up to six months in jail.
   Chan Ping-kwong, spokesman for the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department, said the government would collect data on snake imports
to make sure the reptiles aren't in danger of extinction.
   More than 100,000 snakes are imported by Hong Kong each year,
mostly from China, Chan said.
   Serpent eating is a feature of social life in the British
colony, especially during winter when the vipers are reportedly
tastiest, having gorged themselves to prepare for hibernation.
   Snake soup is a staple of business banquets this time of year,
and trade unions are organizing year-end snake feasts to kick off
an election campaign for the legislature and other local offices
next year.
   The most common snake dish is a soup, cooked with mushrooms,
bamboo shoots and dried orange peels. The potion is reputed to
speed the metabolism and improve male sexual performance.
   Another favorite, snakes' skin soaked in malt wine, is believed
to have calming effects similar to that of tranquilizers.
   Perhaps the most spectacular way of eating snake is swallowing
raw bladders. The dark green organ is extremely slippery and has an
intensely bitter taste.
   To show how fresh their product is, Hong Kong vendors bite the
snake's head off in front of customers, who get to watch the body
of the reptile wriggle through the vendor's fingers as he searches
for the organ.
   The conservation organization World Wide Fund For Nature said it
supported the government's licensing decision.
   ``If unrestricted trade continues, snakes will one day become
endangered,'' said Amy Lau, the fund's conservation officer in Hong
Kong.
   Snake trader Tam Sun, who runs a small shop in downtown Hong
Kong that sells snake soup, said he has no choice but to pass on
the cost of the new import license to his customers, who now pay $2
for a bowl.
   ``Our profit margin is already pretty narrow,'' Tam said, after
biting off the head of a green snake. ``Prices of snake soup will
go up 30 percent.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Weapons-Smuggling Case Against 2 Europeans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge dismissed weapons-smuggling
charges against two Europeans accused of trying to ship thousands
of anti-tank missiles and other weapons to Iraq, Iran and Libya.
   U.S. District Judge Patricia Fawsett's ruling Friday, after
three weeks of government testimony, closed a high-profile case
that began in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in early
August.
   She agreed with defense attorneys that there was not enough
evidence to prove intent or a conspiracy to smuggle the weapons.
   ``Prosecutors connected with the case were involved in
grandstanding from the very beginning,'' said defense attorney Don
Lykkebak, noting the arrests and indictment were ballyhooed in a
Washington news conference featuring TOW missile props. ``The
problem was there was never any case.''
   Claus Fuhler, 33, a German-born ophthalmologist living in
Barcelona, Spain, and Juan Martin Peche-Koesters, 36, a Madrid
businessman, were arrested Aug. 15 nearly two weeks after the
Iraqi invasion.
   They were accused of trying to buy such items as 10,000 TOW
missiles, 20,000 artillery shells, artillery-equipped jeeps,
rifles, grenades and mortars, as well as nuclear waste and chemical
garbage.
   The two men were charged with violating the Arms Export Control
Act, which bans arms sales to the three countries.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Genzman issued a statement saying that
despite the dismissal of charges his office would not be deterred
from prosecuting arms smugglers.
   ``We accept the court's decision but we also want to stress the
importance of pursuing arms traffickers who jeopardize our national
security interests,'' he said.
   Customs agents said the arrests culminated a yearlong sting
code-named ``Operation Dragon,'' in which a U.S. manufacturer of
the TOW missiles tipped authorities that Fuhler and Peche-Koesters
allegedly were seeking 10,000 missiles for $160 million.
   At the time of the arrests, an undercover agent posing as an
arms dealer said the men were trying to buy 200 TOW missiles for
shipment through Spain to Libya. U.S. Customs Service Commissioner
Carol Hallett had said the case was ``clearly'' linked to Iraq's
action in Kuwait.

<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rented boat capsized in rough
Mediterranean waters early Saturday while ferrying about 100 U.S.
sailors back from shore leave to the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga.
Police said 19 bodies were recovered.
   Before the latest police report, an American official confirmed
11 deaths and said nine men were still missing.
   Haifa police spokesman Chaim Avinoam said a total of 19 bodies
were found after divers began searching the hull of the sunken
ferry boat for victims.
   Police and American officials said Saratoga commanders had begun
a head count of the entire Saratoga crew and that final fatality
figures would not be available for several hours.
   At least 33 sailors were taken to Israeli hospitals for
treatment, an Israeli doctor said. Police gunboats, helicopters and
rescue vessels, which plucked 42 other seamen from the water and
took them on to the Saratoga, continued scouring Haifa Bay before
dawn.
   The Saratoga, part of the U.S. Sixth Fleet based in Italy, is
stationed in the eastern Mediterranean as a battle group included
in the multinational force opposing Iraq. The carrier has a crew of
about 6,200.
   According to sailors at the scene and a U.S. official who spoke
on condition of anonymity, the boat was a privately rented Israeli
launch.
   ``It was overloaded at the rear and because of the high seas,
water started coming over the stern,'' said one young sailor, who
spoke on condition he not be identified. ``Once it started coming
over, it capsized very quickly.''
   Kip Burke, commander, Sixth Fleet Staff, based in Gaeta, Italy,
said about 100 sailors were aboard the boat. He said an
investigation had begun into the accident but he was uncertain how
far off shore the boat was when the 1:30 a.m. incident occurred.
   ``There is a lot of confusion,'' Burke said. ``The biggest
problem is counting heads.''
   An estimated 1,650 American servicemen from the Saratoga and at
least three escort ships disembarked at Haifa on Friday for
Christmas leave, a U.S. spokesman said. All the sailors aboard the
capsized boat were from the Saratoga, officials said.
   After the capsizing, the port of Haifa was declared a closed
military zone and flares were seen illuminating the entire bay
area. Israeli navy vessels and air force helicopters were helping
search and evacuate the sailors.
   Reporters said the accident happened in rough seas with 3- to
4-foot-high waves.
   Twenty-three survivors were taken to Rambam Hospital in Haifa,
said Dr. Zvi Ben-Yishai.
   They removed their soaked clothing - many of them wore Israeli
army uniforms to warm themselves - and all had their feet enclosed
in blue plastic bags. Some still were shivering hours after the
accident, drinking hot soup from plastic bowls.
   Ben-Yishai said he knew of at least 10 other sailors taken to
hospitals elsewhere in Haifa, a port frequented by U.S. vessels in
the region and about 75 miles northwest of Jerusalem.
   In Washington, Lt. Col. Quentin Banks, a Pentagon spokesman,
said identities of the dead sailors were not immediately released.
   The Saratoga is normally based at Mayport Naval Air Station in
Jacksonville, Fla., but since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
U.S. forces have been added to the region.
   The Saratoga is accompanied by the destroyer Sampson, cruiser
South Carolina and combat storage ship Sirius, said U.S. Embassy
spokesman Don Cofman in Tel Aviv. He said the sailors in the
accident were all apparently from the Saratoga.

   Aaaah, chestnuts roasting in volcanic fires, 48
million years ago.
   Christmas didn't start in this part of the world, but there is
geologic evidence that many of its trappings existed in the Pacific
Northwest during the Eocene Epoch.
   Chestnuts, and forerunners of the traditional fir Yule log, were
roasting in volcanic fires 48 million years ago in north-central
Washington, before there were noses for Jack Frost to nip.
   ``We have the oldest fossil records of Christmas trees - the fir
lineage - the oldest records of mistletoe, of holly and of Castanea
(edible) chestnut, and the oldest fossil records of gooseberry,
wild currant, apple, blackberry, and pear,'' said Wes Wehr,
paleobotany curator at the University of Washington's Burke Museum.
   ``And, oh yes, also the oldest fossil record of cranberry,'' he
said. ``I guess what I need to do is find the fossil turkey, and
then we're ready for dinner.''
   Evidence of the precursors to some of today's plants, including
those used to celebrate Christmas, were found the past several
years at fossil sites 100 miles apart, in Republic, Wash., and
Princeton, British Columbia.
   Besides plants, the Republic site has been rich in insect finds,
Wehr said Friday.
   ``Besides other things, we're getting the only records of the
North American Eocene earwigs, and we have the earliest fossil
record of the cutter bee,'' Wehr said.
   The plants and insects, along with early fishes, were preserved
when a heavy layer of volcanic ash suddenly fell on a shallow lake
that covered what is now Republic, a town of 1,000 people.
   The fossils have been gathered by Wehr and other scientists from
around the country at a shale cliff on the north side of Republic.
He started digging at the shale rocks in 1977, after there had been
occasional fossil finds. The site, with a small museum, has gained
status in paleontology circles.
   ``It's one of the great places in North America to see fish,
insects and plants, all associated,'' Wehr said. ``It's been
interesting to begin collecting a few specimens on what was a
corner lot, and have it become a place where scientists come from
around the country.''
   Some of the leading paleontologists from around the United
States, and from other nations, are expected to attend a workshop
at Republic in June.
   Visitors, including tourists, are also given a tour of the
Stonerose Interpretational Center, then encouraged to start
breaking rocks.
   Many important scientific finds have been made by people who
can't even spell paleontology, Wehr said.
   ``Often you will have a 9- or 10-year-old student break open a
rock and they have found a distinct new species,'' Wehr said. ``It
makes it all much more real.''

   The co-founder of Earth First! and four members
of the militant environmental group will stand trial on charges
stemming from an alleged plot to sabotage nuclear power plants.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Broomfield set an April 2 trial date
on Friday after accepting innocent pleas from four of the
defendants charged in an indictment returned last week.
   David Foreman, who helped found Earth First! 10 years ago and
resigned from the organization last summer, is charged with
conspiracy to sabotage a nuclear facility and destruction of an
energy facility. Broomfield set a Dec. 26 arraignment for Foreman.
   The other defendants are Mark Leslie Davis, Margaret Katherine
Millett, Marc Andre Baker and Ilse Washington Asplund, all of
Prescott. They face the same conspiracy charges as Foreman, plus
charges of malicious destruction of property, destruction of
property of an energy facility and depredation of government
property. All pleaded innocent and will remain free on bond pending
trial.
   Broomfield rejected a motion by Foreman's lawyer, Gerry Spence
of Jackson, Wyo., that his client be tried separately from the
other defendants.
   Davis, Baker and Millett were arrested in May 1989 as they
allegedly were attempting to cut down a power pole west of Phoenix
with a propane torch.
   The original indictment against the three and Foreman alleged
they planned to topple the power pole as a training exercise for a
broader attack on lines leading to three nuclear power plants,
including the Palo Verde Plant 50 miles west of Phoenix.
   Asplund was added as a defendant in an second indictment issued
last week, which alleges Davis and Millett sabotaged a ski lift in
1987.

   The accolades and self-congratulation over the
accomplishments of Italy's six-month presidency of the European
Community have faded to whispers.
   Now it's back to business as usual for the Italian government:
trying to avoid collapse. Many are predicting that Premier Guilio
Andreotti's five-party coalition may survive only a few more weeks.
   With the uneasy alliance between the dominant Christian
Democrats and Socialists nearing the breaking point, the parties
have scheduled a series of meetings for January to decide whether
Italy's 49th postwar government can be salvaged.
   The country is also embroiled in a furor over President
Francesco Cossiga, the head of state who is supposed to be above
the daily trench warfare between political parties. Some
politicians are demanding he resign for having defended a secret
Cold War guerrilla force.
   There had been a tacit accord among Italy's fractious political
parties to refrain from provoking a government crisis during the
country's high-profile term at the helm of the EC, from July
through December.
   Only two months ago Italy's leadership had been the target of
scorn and ridicule in some EC circles, especially in Britain. The
Economist magazine compared the Italian presidency to ``a bus trip
with the Marx Brothers in the driver's seat.''
   But the Italians claim to have gotten the last laugh.
   First, at an EC summit in Rome in October, they pushed through
plans for monetary union that isolated British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and led to her downfall.
   Last week, Italy steered the community through a landmark summit
that approved emergency aid for the Soviet Union and formally
launched the 12-nation trading bloc on an ambitious path toward
political and economic federation.
   ``Andreotti has sent the bus driven by the Marx Brothers back to
Westminster,'' Turin's La Stampa newspaper headlined Monday.
   With the EC leadership about to be passed to Luxembourg,
Andreotti may find it harder to keep his own government partners on
course. He has been in office since July 1989, a feat of longevity
in a country where governments often last only a few months.
   The 71-year-old Christian Democrat and six-time premier has
skillfully managed to avoid a complete rupture in the fragile
alliance with Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and
Liberals.
   But the strains have grown in recent days. As usual, the
squabbling is part of a power struggle in which the Christian
Democrats, Socialists and opposition Communists play the major
roles.
   The Socialists, led by former Premier Bettino Craxi, are Italy's
third largest party and represent the Christian Democrats' key ally
in keeping the Communists out of the government.
   The Socialists are demanding that referendums be held to revamp
the country's electoral system and allow direct election of the
president.
   The eventual aim of the Socialists, analysts say, is a strong
presidency on the lines of the U.S. or French models, with Craxi as
a candidate for the job. The presidency is now mainly a ceremonial
post.
   The Christian Democrats prefer to strengthen the role of
Parliament, where they can more easily maintain their dominance.
   Francesco D'Onofrio, a Christian Democrat parliamentarian, says
there is an ``80 percent'' chance the government will collapse in
January and a good likelihood of general elections in the spring, a
year ahead of schedule.
   But the government might feel compelled to stay together if war
breaks out in the Persian Gulf, D'Onofrio said. Italy has sent
warships and fighter planes to the multinational force opposing
Iraq.
   Another element of the political crisis is the controversy over
Operation Gladio, a clandestine force created in the 1950s to wage
guerrilla war in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion. Gladio's
existence was disclosed in October by Andreotti, with other NATO
countries later confirming they had similar networks.
   Cossiga, a Christian Democrat, has vigorously defended Gladio as
a legitimate force necessary to counter Communist threats to
Western Europe during the Cold War.
   His statements raised the ire of some politicians, mainly the
Communists, who say Gladio was linked with right-wing terrorism and
targeted Italian Communists.

<HEAD>Army, Navy Record Best-Ever Safety Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The past year was the safest on record for the
Army and Navy, military officials said.
   Private vehicle accidents remained the biggest killer of
soldiers and sailors.
   Accidents claimed the lives of 353 soldiers during the budget
year ended Sept. 30, the Army said. The figure includes mishaps
that occurred off-base and off-duty.
   The time period included the first rush of troops to the Persian
Gulf.
   More than two-thirds of the deaths were from private automobile
accidents. In the comparable period a year earlier, the Army had
369 accidental deaths.
   There were 732,000 Army personnel on active duty at the end of
accounting period.
   Total Army accidents were down by 1,348 from the previous year,
to 8,647, and deaths from aviation accidents fell from 35 to 33.
   Col. Steven Raho, deputy director of Army safety, attributed the
safety improvement to a variety of factors, including increased
effort by the Army to design safety features into new equipment
rather than adding the features after production.
   The Navy, which had 579,000 personnel on active duty at the end
of the budget year, said it recorded 255 total deaths from
accidents, including 206 not related to Navy operations. That was
down from 339 total Navy deaths the year before, of which 47
occurred in the April 19, 1989 explosion aboard the battleship USS
Iowa.
   Two-thirds of total Navy accidental deaths were from private
vehicle wrecks.
   The Navy had 39 deaths from aviation accidents, including those
involving Marine Corps aircraft. The Navy total of 30 deaths from
aviation was the lowest on record, as was the Marine Corps total of

<HEAD>Experiment To Bring Cameras Into Courtrooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans could get their first chance to see
television coverage of federal judges at work next year.
   The experiment will likely begin in appeals courts in New York
or San Francisco or a trial court in one of six states, court
officials said Friday.
   ``The courts have been selected. Now, it's a matter of the news
media requesting coverage in particular cases,'' said David
Sellers, a spokesman for the policymaking U.S. Judicial Conference.
   The conference, composed of 27 federal judges and headed by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, approved the three-year
experiment last September. Individual courts then were invited to
volunteer.
   Those selected are federal appellate courts based in San
Francisco and New York City, and U.S. District Courts in Indiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington.
   A final report submitted Friday to the Judicial Conference by a
special committee said, ``The selection of large courts would bring
more judges into the program, and their location in metropolitan
news markets would likely generate greater media activity.''
   Beginning in July, broadcast and photographic access will be
allowed in civil cases in the selected courts. Judges will have
broad discretion to reject requests for coverage.
   Cameras and radio equipment have been banned from federal courts
since 1937, but 45 states allow some form of broadcast or
photographic coverage of proceedings in their courts.

<HEAD>Democratic Leaders To Hold Off On Millionaire Surtax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic House leaders have abandoned a plan
to present a surtax on millionaires as the first order of business
when Congress convenes next month, but the proposal may resurface
later, aides say.
   Democrats are turning their attention instead to piecing
together a package aimed at promoting ``economic growth and tax
fairness,'' one aide to a top Democrat said Friday. They hope to
have the legislation ready by the time President Bush presents his
State of the Union address on Jan. 29, the aide said.
   ``Don't focus too much on whether it's H.R. 1 or not,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   H.R. 1 is the number assigned to the first bill introduced in
the House at the beginning of a session of Congress. The 102nd
Congress convenes Jan. 3, when lawmakers are likely to introduce
their first bills.
   The official said Democratic leaders still had not decided what
would be in the economic growth package, but would not rule out a
surtax on millionaires.
   Until now, Democratic leaders had spoken of making the session's
first bill a tax hike on the rich. The issue was a big political
winner for Democrats during this year's budget battle with the
White House. They used the proposal - and Republican opposition to
it - to characterize the GOP as the party of the wealthy.

   When Ken Gates does a little stumping,
he's not thinking about politics.
   Gates, the owner of a local electronics store, enjoys
``branching out'' during the holidays, donning a $1,000 custom-made
Christmas tree suit and entertaining at nursing homes and
hospitals.
   And this tree also has a few tricks up its ``sleeve.''
   ``Sometimes when I'm at a hospital, I stand completely still at
the nurses' station and someone will pass by to go see a patient,''
Gates says. ``On their way back by, I'll move. Usually, you'll find
someone will scream.''
   Gates has 1,200 bulbs, assorted ornaments and a blinking star on
his costume. It's made of hula hoops held together with nylon
thread. He carries a 32-pound battery pack to light the lights,
which are capable of flashing in different colors.
   ``With the adult patients, it's wild. They just can't believe
you have so many lights, and they've never seen anything like it
before,'' Gates says. ``The kids just go crazy. They can't fathom
seeing so many blinking lights and there's no cords, no wires to go
behind it.''
   A burn-unit patient at one hospital frantically rang for her
nurses after he roamed down a hallway and past her room.
   ``She said, `I still think I got too much medication,''' Gates
said, laughing.

   What started as a battle over dress and
hair length has turned into a full-scale student rebellion.
   In the past month, thousands of high school students have taken
to the streets in protest, occupied schools and won support from
university students, who have begun their own demonstrations.
   The uprising is hampering the 8-month-old conservative
administration's ability to govern Greece, and represents the New
Democracy party's first serious challenge. Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis and his Cabinet held more than four
emergency meetings in a week on the problem.
   Greece is not alone. In France this fall, thousands of high
school students also held demonstrations demanding improved schools
and safety.
   More than 50,000 high school and university students marched
through the capital Dec. 18 calling for the resignation of
Education Minister Vasillis Kontoyannopoulos.
   They also demand the scrapping of a newly proposed educational
reform package, which include provisions for punishment for sloppy
appearance or improper behavior.
   High school students say the legislation is vague about
discipline and does not explain the grading system. They also want
more government money for education.
   The demonstrators chanted ``our dreams will become your
nightmares'' and ``the law will never be passed'' as they waved
clenched fists at Parliament in central Constitution Square.
   ``The continuation of these mobilizations is not only harmful
but dangerous. The government has proven it is understanding, but
these actions just make things worse,'' Kontoyannopoulos said.
   High school students have taken over more than 2,000 schools
around Greece, or 67 percent of the total, since late November.
University students began sympathy strikes at their own campuses in
mid-December.
   The high school students were protesting a series of
presidential decrees this year that allow teachers to give penalty
points to rule breakers. The rules included a phrase that said
students must maintain a ``tidy and smart appearance.''
   Enough points could lead to lower grades or transfer to another
school. Students complained the decrees did not define proper dress
and behavior but left the decision to teachers.
   The decrees were introduced as a stopgap measure until the
government could introduce its reform package. In presenting the
package, the government withdrew the decrees and ``control system''
but retained other proposals that angered the students.
   The university protest is aimed at a proposal that would allow
the establishment of private universities, currently banned by the
constitution.
   ``It degrades our education and degrees. If students want to
attend private universities they should go abroad,'' said a
student, who requested anonymity.
   The government has already taken tough stands to quench protests
against economic austerity measures, a law labor restricting
strikes and an anti-terrorism law that exercises prior restraint on
press coverage of terrorist attacks.
   ``It is the philosophy of no concessions. They are trying to
preserve their image of being decisive and uncompromising,,'' said
former Socialist Education Minister George Papandreou, son of
former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.
   His father's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, ruled
Greece from 1981 until Andreas Papandreou was voted out of office
in June 1989. Coalition governments ran Greece until the
conservatives were elected last April.
   Students are also upset that the government allowed riot police
to use clubs and tear gas to disperse a previous demonstration.
   ``We began taking over our schools because we have various
problems with the laws they are trying to force on us,'' said
Michalis, a 17-year-old student who attends Athens public high
school No. 1, the oldest in Greece and the alma matter of many
politicians and academics.
   The neo-classical building, nestled near the base of the ancient
Acropolis, has been closed since Dec. 10. Nervous students talk to
visitors through a broken window. The front door is chained shut.
   Kontoyannopoulos' stated aim has to bring the school system in
line with the ethics and goals of Orthodox Christian Greek society.
More than 97 percent of Greece's population is baptized into the
church.
   He said the socialists allowed the educational system to become
undisciplined and politically biased.

<HEAD>Michael Oakeshott, Political Philosopher, Dead At 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political philosopher Michael Oakeshott, whose
stress on personal responsibility and freedom was said by some to
have laid the foundations for Margaret Thatcher's social policies,
died at age 89, his family said today.
   Oakeshott died Tuesday at his home at Acton in southwest
England. No cause of death was given.
   The son of a prominent socialist, Oakeshott was educated at
Cambridge University's Gonville and Caius College.
   In 1951, when he became University Professor of Political
Science at London University's London School of Economics, his
conservative ideas were a sharp contrast with socialist Harold
Laski, whom he replaced.
   Oakeshott held the post until 1969 when he was made Professor
Emeritus at the University of London.
   Oakeshott was credited with turning conservative opinion away
from social planning and back to personal responsibility and
freedom.
   The Times of London wrote in an obituary notice today: ``More
than anybody else Michael Oakeshott articulated the real
philosophical foundations of Mrs. Thatcher's policies. Yet he had
no direct influence on her and she was disposed to consider him
irrelevant for her purposes because unlike Hayek, he made no
practical recommendations.''
   Mrs. Thatcher claimed that her philosophy of individual
self-reliance was influenced by the Austrian economist Friedrich
Hayek and his 1944 book ``The Road to Serfdom,'' a critical study
of socialistic trends in Britain.
   Oakeshott once said in an interview: ``I am a member of no
political party. I vote, if I have to vote, for the party which is
likely to do the least harm. To that extent, I am a Tory.''
   He always insisted political theory offered no guidance in
political practice and that his work was intended only as a
contribution to scholarship.
   Oakeshott's books included ``Experience and its Modes,''
published in 1933; ``Social and Political Doctrines of Contemporary
Europe;'' ``Hobbes's Leviathan;'' ``Rationalism in Politics and
Other Essays;'' ``On Human Conduct;'' and ``The Voice of Liberal
Learning'' which came out just last year.
   ``A Guide to the Classics,'' which Oakeshott wrote with a
colleague in 1936, dealt not with famous books but with picking
winners at the racetracks, which he frequented.
   Oakeshott is survived by his wife and a son by a previous
marriage.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Help Get Cheyenne Brando Back for Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has refused to assist
prosecutors seeking to extradite Marlon Brando's daughter from
Tahiti to testify at her half-brother's murder trial.
   Superior Court Judge Joel Rudof said Friday he declined to get
involved because of the woman's precarious mental state.
   ``There is insufficient information to permit this court to
further endanger what appears to be a fragile mental condition and
attempt to have Miss Brando returned,'' Rudof wrote.
   The judge ruled after reviewing a psychiatrist's report.
   ``At this point it appears that unless her condition changes,
she will not be able to testify. We are not going to appeal ... we
will be re-evaluating the case without her testimony,'' said Sandi
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
   The international legal tangle over the prosecution's key
witness, 20-year-old Cheyenne, has helped slow proceedings. She
fled to Tahiti after her brother's arrested and attempted suicide
twice, leading to her confinement in a Tahitian mental hospital.
   Christian Brando, 32, is charged with the May 16 slaying of
Cheyenne's Tahitian lover, 26-year-old Dag Drollet. The alleged
crime took place in Marlon Brando's hilltop compound above
Hollywood and trial has been set for Jan. 14.
   Miss Brando fled to Tahiti a month after Drollet's death and
gave birth to his child. She has refused to return to California to
testify, and authorities in Tahiti refuse to allow her to leave,
charging her as an accomplice in Drollet's murder.

   One of New York's biggest ad agencies closed up
shop early for the holidays and employees celebrated by serving
food to the homeless, giving gifts to the needy, renovating homes
and playing Santa to children.
   ``We're going to continue to do this and, if we don't, I
encourage you to come back and write a nasty story about us,'' Jim
Patterson, chairman of the J. Walter Thompson company, said of
Friday's whirlwind of good deeds.
   Ken Adams, executive director of the volunteer group New York
Cares, helped organize the effort for about 300 employees. He said
he wouldn't have bothered if he thought it was just another ad
agency gimmick, adding he plans to return next month to work with
the company on more charitable causes.
   ``They always talked about the long term,'' he said.
   Employees fanned out to about 30 locations around New York City
to help others on Friday.
   They threw a party for needy mothers and children, organized
holiday festivities at a home for the elderly, served food to the
hungry at four sites, helped renovate homes and wrapped gifts for
children.
   Some, like Roger Groves, headed to Central Park to pick up
trash.
   ``Instead of the big-bucks Christmas party, they're donating
their time,'' Groves said of his fellow workers. ``Everybody feels
good about it.''
   Patterson said when he announced plans for the day of good deeds
about 40 to 50 employees wrote him notes saying such things as,
``It's about time'' and ``Best thing you ever did.''
   He said the boost in office morale was obvious.
   ``In a self-serving way, that helps this company,'' he said.

   Snow fell across the Midwest from Nebraska to Oklahoma and on
the cactus-covered terrain of Phoenix early today as a crushing
blast of arctic air continued to hold almost all the nation in
deep-freeze conditions.
   Snow was expected along most of the East Coast from Maine to the
Carolinas and in the Midwest from the Great Lakes to Texas. Rain
was forecast for parts of the South and Southwest.
   The storm that has claimed at least 14 lives since Tuesday
appeared to be breaking up across the Far West, but temperatures
were still expected to be cold, with highs in the 30s for
Washington and Oregon and the 40s and 50s for California.
   Highs in the East were expected to range from the 40s and 50s in
the north to the 60s in the Mid-Atlantic region and the 70s farther
South.
   Most of the Midwest was bracing for bone-chilling cold, with
highs not expected to get above -10 near the Canadian border and
reaching only the 30s and 40s farther South.
   Florida, however, was expecting temperatures in the 80s.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Sturges Photos Show Child Sex</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Note contents of grafs 7, 9</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors defended seizing
pictures from a prominent photographer, saying they were
``undoubtedly within the definition of child pornography'' and
included one of him having sex with a minor.
   The government filed papers Friday opposing Jock Sturges'
request for a court order requiring return of thousands of
photographs and other property that officers seized from his San
Francisco home last April.
   The papers said the seizures were justified by evidence from a
photo lab that child pornography would be found at the home.
Prosecutors also said officers acted properly in entering the home
without a warrant because of concern that Sturges might destroy
evidence or harm himself.
   Much of the material already has been returned, but some
photographs will not be returned because they ``plainly are
lascivious'' and are therefore ``contraband,'' said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Floy Dawson in the court papers.
   Dawson told a reporter, however, that his office is not yet
ready to file criminal charges against Sturges.
   Sturges, whose nude portraits, many of them of children, are
displayed in major galleries across the nation, said police seized
100,000 photo negatives along with personal files and equipment
during the raid. His lawyer said the search was illegal and the
property must be returned. A hearing is scheduled Jan. 4.
   The government's papers Friday included statements by a police
inspector and an FBI agent declaring the photos at a San Francisco
laboratory and Sturges' home included pictures that prominently
displayed the genitals of underage girls.
   Dawson appeared to acknowledge Sturges' claim that the FBI had
been calling families he had photographed around the world and
telling them he was accused of being a child pornographer and a
pedophile.
   ``This can hardly be surprising'' in light of the evidence,
Dawson wrote. ``Mr. Sturges had in his possession hundreds of
photographs of pre-pubescent girls that vividly (focus) on the
genitals, correspondence indicating his own sexual relationships
with minor girls, and photographs of himself engaged in sexual
contact with a 15-year-old girl.''

<TEXT>
   A former ballerina who lost the use of her legs
in a car crash seven years ago thanked jurors for their $14.3
million damage award but said no amount of money could make up for
what she has gone through.
   A state Supreme Court jury set the award Friday for Shenikwa
Dawn Nowlin, 31, who was paralyzed from the waist down when a car
she was riding in went out of control on New York City's West Side
Highway in August 1983, and crashed into a wall.
   Former New York Yankee infielder Andre Robertson, who was
driving, testified that a warning sign was placed too close to a
sharp curve and he didn't have time to slow down.
   ``Nobody can be compensated for the kinds of injuries I
received,'' Nowlin said outside the courtroom after thanking
jurors. ``If I had it to do over again, I'd be walking and not
sitting here. No money can pay for what has happened to me.''
   Nowlin, who is now a lawyer, was the Dance Theatre of Harlem's
youngest member when she was 14.
   Jurors ruled that New York City was 67 percent liable for
Nowlin's injuries because the sign didn't provide sufficient
warning. They ruled Robertson was 33 percent liable for exceeding
the highway's 40 mph speed limit.
   Nowlin and Robertson testified the car was traveling 60 to 65
mph when the crash occurred, but a witness said it appeared to be
going 80 mph.
   The jury did not find Nowlin negligent for not wearing a seat
belt.
   Robertson's attorney, Daniel McNamara, said his client's
insurance would cover about $25,000 of the award, but because
Robertson is not wealthy the city would have to pay most of the
award. He said city officials could try to recover some of the
money from Robertson later.
   It was not immediately known if Robertson or the city would
appeal.
   Robertson, 33, retired from baseball last year and now works at
a steam generating plant in Texas.

   A wide-bodied passenger jet landed on the wrong
runway at Logan Airport in July, but the Federal Aviation
Administration had no record of the mistake, a newspaper reported
today.
   FAA officials have records of only seven of 20 ``runway
incursions'' at Logan reported to the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration during the first eight months of the year,
according to The Boston Globe.
   Barry Bermingham, FAA special projects manager for the New
England region, said an ``exhaustive search'' is under way to
determine why the agency was not aware of the July incident.
   He said it was possible the controller who handled the flight
decided the landing error did not create a safety hazard so no
report was filed.
   The incident was reported by the flight crew of the unidentified
commercial airliner to NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System.
NASA gives those who file reports anonymity and immunity from
penalties for possible wrongdoing.
   The system is designed to create a large data base of potential
safety problems so aviation officials can correct problems.
   The report states the plane was cleared to land at Logan in
cloudy weather with visibility of 15 miles.
   The pilot was using computers and an automatic pilot to approach
the designated runway. But he landed the plane manually because the
computer did not capture the glide slope, which is needed for an
instrument landing.
   The pilot said he had no idea he had landed on the wrong runway
until afterward. No one was injured.

   Lech Walesa, the electrician who led a
workers' movement that deposed Communist rulers to begin sweeping
changes in Eastern Europe, was sworn in today as Poland's first
popularly elected president.
   The 47-year-old labor activist, elected earlier this month by a
landslide, assumed the country's highest office at an inauguration
ceremony before both houses of Parliament.
   He took power 10 years after he led the shipyard strike that
created Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent trade union.
   One year ago, he put together Poland's first non-Communist
government, and democratic revolutions against other
Soviet-influenced Communist regimes swept across Eastern Europe in
the weeks afterward.
   ``I solemnly swear to the Polish people that I will be faithful
to constitutional decisions. I will protect the dignity of the
nation, the sovereignty and security of the state. I swear. ... So
help me God,'' Walesa said in a firm, clear voice. His wife Danuta
stood at his side as the oath was administered by parliament
Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz.
   ``The evil era when the authorities of our country were
appointed under pressure of foreigners or as the result of forced
compromises is ending,'' Walesa told the parliament immediately
after his oath.
   He pledged Poland would become ``an element of the peaceful
order in Europe'' but said Poles would have to believe in
themselves to revitalize economic life.
   ``Passivity and apathy - these are the biggest obstacles on the
road toward the well-being of Poles,'' he said.
   Walesa, elected Dec. 9, had refused to accept the post from the
incumbent president, Communist Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who was
this nation's last Communist leader. Jaruzelski was not invited to
the ceremony.
   Jaruzelski jailed Walesa and other Solidarity leaders during the
martial law crackdown in 1981.
   Legitimacy was to be conferred later in the day by Ryszard
Kaczorowski, president of the anti-Communist government-in-exile in
London that descends directly from the Warsaw government forced to
flee from the Nazis in 1939. During the postwar decades of
Communist rule, the government-in-exile nourished hopes of
returning home.
   Kaczorowski, returning for the first time, was to give Walesa an
insignia of office and other prewar symbols of power in the
ceremony at the Royal Castle, where Poland's first democratic
constitution was written in 1791.
   Walesa was also to accept the blessing of the Roman Catholic
Church, with a Mass to be celebrated in honor of his presidency by
the Cardinal Jozef Glemp, Poland's Roman Catholic leader.
   In statements since his election, Walesa declared his presidency
would mark the culmination of the struggle to throw off foreign
domination.
   Honoring the dozens of Baltic Coast workers gunned down 20 years
ago during anti-government strikes over bread and meat prices,
Walesa said Sunday that as president he would strive ``to realize
the last will of those who died.''
   Free Poland has existed more in literature and song than in
reality for the past two centuries.
   Since 1795, Poland has enjoyed only 21 years of independence
from rule by foreign powers, principally Germany and Russia. Even
that interlude, between the world wars, was darkened by a coup and
strongman rule.
   Walesa's critics fear he will be another strongman in the
tradition of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, who after a 1926 military
takeover allowed the trappings of democracy but pulled the strings
as military commander.
   Walesa must assemble a government that maintains dramatic
market-oriented economic reform that won the confidence of the
West, while responding to discontent voters showed by
overwhelmingly rejecting Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's
presidential bid.
   Walesa has pledged to complete the radical free-market reform of
the economy, but the program has already boosted unemployment and
sent prices soaring.
   Walesa won his office with 75 percent of the vote after fending
off a dark horse challenge by unknown emigre businessman Stanislaw
Tyminski, branded by Walesa as a front-man for a
``counter-revolution'' by former Communists.
   The bitter election campaign also split the Solidarity movement,
leaving Walesa alienated from Mazowiecki and most of his other
former intellectual advisers.
   As president, Walesa's first task will be to nominate a prime
minister to run the government on a day-to-day basis, while
preparing for elections that would replace the Parliament elected
under a 1989 bargain that guaranteed 65 percent of seats for
Communists or their allies.
   Walesa announced Thursday that he was unable to name a prime
minister until after the Christmas and New Year holidays. He said
he is wavering between two options.
   One would be to keep a modified version of Mazowiecki's current
caretaker Cabinet for about three months until fully democratic
parliament elections in the spring. The other would create an all
new Cabinet that would be given a year to work before elections.

<HEAD>Police Say Florida Man's Slaying May Be Linked To Serial Murder
Suspects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The slaying of a middle-aged man whose body
was found dumped in a remote area may be connected to eight other
killings believed to be the work of two women, police said.
   The body of Daniel Mitchell Conger Jr. was found Friday in woods
at the end of a dirt road in this north-central Florida area.
Conger, 50, was apparently shot with a small-caliber handgun, but
police refused to say how many times.
   Authorities were hoping the results of an autopsy scheduled
today would indicate whether the killing was linked to eight other
slayings they believe are the work of two female serial killers.
   ``It might be related, we just don't know yet,'' said sheriff's
Sgt. Robert Douglas. ``There's just not enough evidence yet to link
it.''
   Authorities began searching for Conger after he did not show up
for work Friday morning.
   The bodies of the other victims, all middle-aged men, were found
in remote areas of Florida and Georgia. Each had been shot with a
.22-caliber handgun. In many cases, including Conger's, the
victim's car was recovered in another county.
   Hundreds of sightings of women resembling composite police
sketches of the suspects have been reported, but no arrests have
been made.

<TEXT>
   The state is seeking the suspension
of nine top officials of a casino workers union the federal
government alleges is under mob control.
   In a complaint filed Friday with the Casino Control Commission,
state law enforcement officials asked the commissioners to suspend
the officials from the union and revoke their registration. Unions
representing casino workers and their top officials have to be
registered with the commission, which regulates gambling in
Atlantic City.
   The complaint was filed by the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement, an investigative branch of the state Attorney
General's Office. The commission is scheduled to consider the
complaint at its next meeting Jan. 2.
   The action follows the civil racketeering lawsuit filed
Wednesday by the federal Justice Department against Local 54 of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. The local
represents 15,000 casino workers and about 7,000 waitresses and
bartenders outside the city.
   The federal lawsuit charges the local has been controlled
through violence and intimidation for the last 20 years by a crime
family reputedly headed by Angelo Bruno and Nicodemo ``Little
Nicky'' Scarfo, now serving a 70-year prison sentence for
racketeering.
   Union officials have denied the charges.
   The federal lawsuit and accompanying affidavits, according to
the complaint, ``clearly establish the lengthy history of Local
54's domination by members of organized crime.''

   Former Gov. Sigurd Anderson, whose career
in government also included stints as state attorney general and
member of the Federal Trade Commission, died Friday of prostate
cancer at age 86.
   Anderson, who immigrated to the United States from Norway at age
2, set up a law practice in Webster in 1937 and twice was elected
Day County state's attorney.
   He enlisted in the Navy in 1942 and served both in the United
States and in the western Pacific during World War II. Anderson
achieved the rank of lieutenant commander in the U.S. Naval
Reserve.
   In 1946, Anderson, a Republican, returned to South Dakota and
was elected attorney general. He won a second term two years later
and was elected governor in 1950 and 1952.
   After his second term as governor ended, he was appointed to the
FTC by President Eisenhower. He resigned from the commission in
1964 to make another run for governor, but he lost in the GOP
primary to Nils Boe. As governor, Boe later appointed Anderson to
fill a vacancy as a circuit judge.
   Anderson retired in 1975.

<HEAD>Cambodian Peace Talks Resume</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed government and three
guerrilla factions were under increased pressure to accept a U.N.
peace plan as talks resumed today.
   Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fell ill during the first
day of talks Friday, was expected to rejoin the meeting of the
12-member Supreme National Council. The talks were to conclude
later today.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, addressing Friday's
opening session, warned that time was running out to reach a
settlement and urged acceptance of the plan that would give the
United Nations a strong role in an interim government.
   ``The world has changed. Other priorities can and will require
our attention,'' Dumas said. ``The international community cannot
indefinitely work out the fate of Cambodia if Cambodians themselves
do not have the political will to do so.''
   He told a news conference that Friday's talks had been
``constructive,'' saying the factions asked questions but did not
reject the plan outright.
   Britain, one of the authors of the plan, also has pressed for
acceptance. It sent an envoy to Paris to discuss normalizing
relations with the Phnom Penh government on condition it accepts
the peace process.
   David Colvin, director of the British Foreign Office's Southeast
Asian Department, said he told Hun Sen's delegation that accepting
the plan could lead to normalizing relations with the West, but
rejecting it would mean further isolation.
   All factions agreed to a version of the plan in September, but
Phnom Penh has since balked, saying the proposal exceeds the
authority of the U.N. Charter.
   The plan calls for the United Nations to administer Cambodia
during an interim period leading to free elections. It also calls
for a cease-fire and disarming of all four parties.
   Phnom Penh is concerned about the extent to which its government
could be dismantled by the plan and about the extent of
disarmament, said a senior Western official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Hun Sen said on his arrival here that ``serious measures must be
taken to suppress the foundations'' of the Chinese-backed Khmer
Rouge, the strongest member of the three-party resistance
coalition.
   Their three-year reign of terror, which ended in 1979 with a
Vietnamese invasion, left hundreds of thousands of Cambodians dead.
   The council, meeting for the second time since its creation
three months ago, is made up of six representatives of Hun Sen's
Vietnamese-backed government and two from each of the three
resistance factions.
   Dumas said the peace plan, agreed to Nov. 26 by the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, was a compromise
text that could be improved but not ``put into question.'' The
permanent members are the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain,
France and China.
   The International Conference on Peace in Cambodia adjourned in
September 1989 after a monthlong effort failed to reach a
settlement.

   A military court today delayed for a week the
court-martial of a policeman accused of fatally shooting four
Israelis near Egypt's border with the Jewish state.
   The three-judge court opened proceedings today, but gave lawyers
an extra week to prepare a defense for Ayman Mohammed Hassan.
   Brig. Mohammed Wagdi el-Leithy, the court's president, ordered
Hassan held without bail until the proceedings resume Dec. 29.
   Hassan, 23, appeared relaxed and cheerful. He was flanked by two
military policemen.
   During a recess, military police kissed him on the cheeks and
gave him cigarettes and tea. One officer, armed with an automatic
rifle and standing behind the judges' table, shouted to colleagues
guarding Hassan to give the defendant his regards.
   He is being tried at 3rd Army headquarters, 10 miles west of
Suez. The city is at the southern end of the Suez Canal, 85 miles
east of Cairo.
   Hassan was charged with four counts of premeditated murder for
the shootings Nov. 25 that killed four Israelis and wounded 27.
   In arguing for a postponement, his attorneys said they needed
more time to study documents in the case.
   Cairo newspapers have reported that Hassan confessed to
investigators that he had shot up the Israeli vehicles. He said he
had acted alone, the reports said.

   The KGB chief warned today that the Soviet Union
must be ready to accept bloodshed in exchange for order and accused
the CIA and other foreign elements of stirring up trouble in the
Soviet Union.
   Later today, parliament ended debate on constitutional
amendments enhancing the powers of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
and the official news agency Tass reported that most lawmakers
would support the proposals.
   In his 25-minute speech to the Congress of People's Deputies,
KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov said outside forces ``are trying to
exert overt and covert pressure on the Soviet Union and to impose
doubtful ideas and plans to pull the country out of its difficult
situation.''
   The CIA is gathering information on workers' movements in the
Soviet Union ``for its purposeful masterminding'' and funding
``anti-Soviet formations'' like radio stations that attack the
Soviet Union, he said.
   Kryuchkov did not say what kind of ideas he thought foreigners
were trying to impose on the Soviets. He asked the 2,250-member
parliament to give his agency more power to fight corruption and
nationalist uprisings.
   ``We will not avoid more serious consequences if we don't start
immediately to fight destruction of our forces,'' Kryuchkov said.
``We should be ready to accept bloodshed if we want to speak about
bringing order to the country.''
   The speech, similar to one Kryuchkov gave earlier this month,
came as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev struggles to maintain
control over independence-minded republics, simmering ethnic
conflicts and a collapsing economy. Food shortages have hit Moscow,
Leningrad and other large cities, prompting Western countries to
send emergency food.
   Fears of political turmoil were heightened with the surprise
resignation Thursday of Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
Shevardnadze blamed ``reactionaries'' for moving the Soviet Union
toward dictatorship and urged reformers to unite to preserve
democratic changes.
   The proposed constitutional amendments debated by the lawmakers
would transform the Soviet system of executive power into a
presidential form of administration. Gorbachev wants more power to
hold the country together and fight corruption while he carries out
economic reform.
   ``Most legislators support the idea of strengthening
presidential powers,'' Tass said.
   Opposition legislators belonging to the Inter-Regional group,
however, said Gorbachev's powers should be dependent on the
approval of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Anatoly Lukyanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, told the
Congress in a 20-minute speech that the deputies should approve the
amendments without reservation. ``If parliament trusts the
president, it should untie his hands and not hold him on a rope of
parliamentary debate,'' Lukyanov said.
   He said preliminary voting on the amendments will begin Monday.
   Kryuchkov said the KGB needs more authority to combat economic
sabotage and nationalist militancy in the republics.
   Nationalists have assembled 26,000 armed fighters in the Soviet
republics of Estonia, Latvia, Armenia and Georgia, he said.
   All 15 Soviet republics have declared sovereignty in some form
from the Kremlin. Georgia, Lithuania, Estonia and Lativa have
declared outright independence.
   In saying the country should be prepared for bloodshed,
Kryuchkov referred to ethnic violence in some republics and asked,
``Isn't there bloodshed already?''
   Boris Yeltsin, the reformist president of the Russian
Federation, dismissed Kryuchkov's speech as old news.
   ``Yes, there is sabotage, yes there is corruption,'' he said.
``We have heard all this before.''
   A representative of the Lithuanian government, attending but not
participating in the congress, accused Kryuchkov of using scare
tactics that have failed before.
   ``If he is speaking about bloodshed, then it will be him who
causes it,'' said Algis Cekoulis.
   Hard-line Communists have urged Gorbachev to impose a state of
emergency in republics ridden by ethnic conflict and separatist
movements. Gorbachev has said he might do that if the Congress
allows him to strengthen his hand in dealing with trouble spots.
   Kryuchkov also said he opposed private property laws that would
let land fall into the hands of ``the black market and shady
enterprises.''
   Shevardnadze's unexpected resignation Thursday pleased
hard-liners, who opposed his role in negotiating the unification of
Germany and Soviet's role in the anti-Iraq coalition.
   Reformers have used his speech as a rallying cry. A parade of
speakers at the Congress on Friday echoed the 62-year-old
diplomat's warning that hard-liners were pushing the country toward
a dictatorship.
   Gorbachev met Friday for two hours with Shevardnadze, reportedly
to discuss some way of keeping his longtime ally in the government.
   It wasn't clear whether Gorbachev intended to ask Shevardnadze
to continue as foreign minister or to take another post. A
Shevardnadze aide said on Thursday that the resignation was
``irreversible.''

<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told
desert-weary Marines today he did not expect President Bush to wait
long past Jan. 15 to send them to war against Iraq if Saddam
Hussein leaves his army in Kuwait.
   Cheney did not say how long he meant by soon, but said he and
Bush were against forgetting the U.N. deadline and instead giving
economic sanctions more time to exact a toll on Baghdad.
   ``The president is deadly serious when he says the whole crisis
cannot be resolved until Saddam Hussein goes back to Baghdad and
withdraws his forces from Kuwait,'' Cheney told members of the 1st
Battalion, 7th Marines, most of whom have been in Saudi Arabia
since mid-August.
   ``I would think that soon after Jan. 15th if he has not
withdrawn his forces from Kuwait we'll be in a position to take
military action in conjunction with our allies,'' Cheney said while
standing atop an M60-A1 tank in the desert some 50 miles from the
Kuwaiti border the Marines might be asked to cross.
   Cheney, in response to a Marine's question, praised other Arab
nations for their support of the military effort, particularly
Egypt, where he is to stop Sunday to meet with President Hosni
Mubarak before returning to Washington.
   Cheney brought Christmas greetings to the troops from Bush and
the American people but added a somber note, telling them they
might soon find themselves at war, or treating its casualties.
   As the secretary visited Marines in the desert and then flew by
helicopter to a Navy hospital ship and Aegis cruiser in the Persian
Gulf, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was
making a separate round of troop visits as well.
   Just how soon American troops will be ready to fight is a
question that became controversial this week when the deputy
commander of Operation Desert Shield said ground forces might not
be combat ready until well into February.
   Those comments were widely interpreted as weakening the Bush
administration's effort to link the threat of attack to the U.N.
deadline.
   Cheney today refused to comment on the remarks, made Wednesday
by Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller. But his tough talk the past
two days appeared to be part of an effort to convince Saddam
ignoring the deadline carried a heavy risk.
   Bush, who was meeting with British Prime Minister John Major at
the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., rejected suggestions
that troops in the Persian Gulf are not battle ready.
   ``If there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now, the
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously,'' Bush said when
asked today about Waller's comments.
   Bush reiterated his determination to soon expel Iraq from Kuwait
in a magazine interview released Friday.
   ``It can't drag on with indecision and it can't stop short of
the U.N. mandate,'' Bush told U.S. News &amp; World Report. ``See, that
argues very forcefully against some of these scenarios that call
for somebody to compromise: we'll give him something for this, give
him something so he saves face. That is not in the books.''
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, meantime, told
reporters for The Associated Press and other news agencies that
Jan. 15 was purely an ``authorization date'' and ``not an attack
day at all.''
   The U.N. resolution ``doesn't say (Saddam) is going to be
attacked this date or that date or whatever,'' the national
security adviser said, adding: ``One of the important points we're
trying to get across to him is that we haven't blinked so far,
we're not blinking now and we will not blink.''
   Cheney and Powell during earlier visits on Friday drew applause
from the troops when they promised, if war erupts, to wage a
violent and destructive campaign.
   ``The only acceptable outcome, if hostilities begin, is
absolute, total victory,'' Cheney declared.
   Powell said he hoped no bloodshed would occur. But if war comes,
he said, ``When we launch it, we will launch it violently, we will
launch it in a way that will make it decisive so we can get it over
as quickly as possible and there's no question who won.''
   It was the second straight day of tough talk from Pentagon
leaders, who appeared to be trying mightily to offset speculation
that the U.S. troops will not be in position to fight on Jan. 15.
   Cheney, in his pep talk to the troops, appeared to be trying to
dispel the notion that Waller's comments removed any military
threat from the deadline.
   Asked by an airman how long the United States would wait to
attack if the deadline passed without an Iraqi withdrawal, Cheney
said:
   ``While I can't tell you a specific date, for obvious reasons,
when that would happen, I can say that we are eager to get this
wrapped up as quickly as possible. We do not think that waiting
indefinitely is going to solve the problem and I'm confident we'll
move as soon as we can to wrap it up.''
   He also promised that Washington would not interfere with
strategic decisions of field commanders.
   ``There will be the freedom and flexibility to run a first-class
military operation all the way,'' Cheney said to applause. ``They
won't have their hands tied behind their backs. There won't be
sanctuaries where the enemy can take cover.''

<TEXT>
   A ferry capsized and sank in rough
Mediterranean waters early today while taking about 100 American
sailors from Christmas shore leave back to the aircraft carrier USS
Saratoga. At least 19 drowned.
   American and Israeli rescue teams searched throughout the night
for others feared missing after the Israeli ferry Tuvia went under
shortly after midnight in windy, choppy seas about 200 yards from
the Saratoga. The U.S. ship was about a mile off the coast.
   Forty-seven sailors were hospitalized and 38 rescued unharmed
from the choppy seas, according to state-owned Israel radio. It
said four were in serious condition and most of the others had been
released later in the morning.
   It was the deadliest accident involving American servicemen
taking part in the U.S.-led multinational force arrayed against
Iraq and raised the number of Americans killed in Operation Desert
Shield to at least 73.
   The sailors were among hundreds who spent their holiday liberty
Friday in Haifa, some with wives and girlfriends who had flown from
home to meet them.
   The Saratoga has a crew of about 4,500.
   A Haifa police spokesman, Chaim Avinoam, said 19 bodies had been
recovered by midmorning. Army spokesman Ranaan Gissen said six of
the bodies were found trapped in the two-deck, 57-foot ferry about
80 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean.
   Officials said at midafternoon that two other sailors still
could be missing. Saratoga commanders recalled all 1,920 men from
shore leave.
   There was no official report on the cause of the sinking.
Witnesses said they believed there were too many people in the back
of the ferry.
   Shaul Raziel, director of the Israel Port authority, said a
combination of events probably caused the accident. ``The seating,
or movement in one direction, a sudden wave, and the disaster
happened,'' he said on army radio.
   Survivors said from beds at Haifa's Rambam Hospital that the
Navy-chartered ferry had taken on water in high seas, then suddenly
overturned as it was hit by two large waves.
   ``It felt like we were going against the waves, so we would go
up and come down ... and everytime we would come back down water
would come in,'' said Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, of San Antonio.
   ``We were going on the waves, and I just noticed one that was
bigger than normal and then we noticed another one that was bigger
than normal. The next thing I know, all I saw coming in was water.
I was tilted forward, I heard a lot of yelling, `She's going
down.'''
   Benjamin suffered a neck injury when he was hit in the water by
one of the rescue boats.
   In the next bed, Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery, 33, of
Mayport, Fla., said the Tuvia sank almost instantly.
   ``All of a sudden I saw water just come flying in. It was maybe
two seconds, and the boat rolled right over,'' said Vickery, who
suffered bleeding lungs from inhaling water.
   The port of Haifa was declared a closed military zone after the
accident and flares illuminated the bay, dotted with search ships,
helicopters, and U.S. and Israeli frogmen searching the sunken
ferry.
   There was confusion over the number of casualties because some
sailors aboard a nearby ferryboat, the Carmelite, jumped into the
water to help rescue their colleagues, said U.S. Embassy spokesman
Don Cofman.
   Some of the Carmelite passengers later were pulled from the
water by rescuers, leading to uncertainty as to how many of the
about 100 sailors aboard the ill-fated Tuvia were accounted for.
   The captain of the sunken boat, who gave his name only as Yossi,
told reporters he believed the ferry sank because too many people
were gathered in the stern.
   ``There were squalls all day and the waves were three to four
feet,'' Tom Abbott of the U.S. Embassy's naval attache's office
said at a news conference.
   Abbott said he talked to one person aboard the other ferry who
said the Tuvia went down almost instantly. ``He turned his back,
turned around again and the ferry was gone. It went down very
fast,'' said Abbott.
   Cofman said it was believed all those aboard the sunken ferry
were from the Saratoga but a few could have been from the escort
vessels.
   The Saratoga is part of a task force has been anchored outside
the breakwater off the northern port of Haifa since Thursday night.
   The Saratoga is accompanied by the destroyer Sampson, cruiser
South Carolina and combat stores ship Sirius, said Cofman.
Officials said the naval task force carries 6,200 men.
   The Saratoga is normally based at Mayport Naval Air Station in
Jacksonville, Fla., but has been in the Mideast since the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   One American sailor told Israel army radio he thought the ferry
Tuvia was swamped because it had ``too many people for too small a
boat. ... It couldn't hold the weight and it just sank.''
   But a crewman, reached by telephone at the Haogen boat company
offices, said the boat was licensed to carry 131 people and had 102
aboard.
   He said the Haogen company had worked with the Navy ferrying
sailors ashore since Haifa first began being used as a liberty port
about 20 years ago.

   Frigid weather held much of the nation in a vice grip today as
subzero cold refused to budge, conjuring more snow, ice, freezing
rain, an ice-jammed river and even a few twisters thrown into a
barrage unlikely to go away by Christmas.
   The far West got the beginnings of a break as the arctic deep
freeze that brought rare heavy snowfall to Seattle and a light snow
to California's seashore started to edge its way eastward.
   ``It will get colder as the days go on, especially toward
Christmas,'' National Weather Service meteorologist Thomas Helman
said in Wisconsin. ``For Monday and Tuesday, we're looking at lows
of 10 to 20 below.''
   The East, meanwhile, had uncommon warmth, with temperatures in
the 50s as far north as New York.
   The weather was blamed for at least 16 deaths since Tuesday, in
Washington, Iowa, Oregon, Montana, California, Wisconsin, Texas,
Oklahoma and Mississippi.
   Only the extreme Northeast and parts of the West Coast escaped
rain or snow Friday. A few flakes even fell on the cactus-covered
terrain of Phoenix, as the first snow in nearly four years hit the
southern Arizona city.
   More heavy snow was forecast for the Great Lakes. Flurries also
were seen for the East Coast from Maine to the Carolinas and across
the Midwest from the Canadian border to Texas.
   Rain was forecast for less frigid areas in the South and
Southwest. Only southern Florida escaped the cold, with
temperatures hovering around 80 degrees.
   In Montana, temperatures fell to 49 below zero in Wisdom, 45
below at Yellowstone and 30 below across much of the rest of the
state Friday.
   Elsewhere in Arizona, 6 inches of snow fell in Flagstaff, with
up to 3 feet piling up in the mountains as storms closed the
Flagstaff, Grand Canyon and Show Low airports.
   A rare snowfall also dusted Monterey in central California and
Malibu in the south Friday.
   ``It's a white Christmas but it's a white Christmas with
whitecaps,'' said windsurfer Mark Moody, who didn't let the snow
keep him out of the water at Leo Carrillo Beach, nrthwest of Los
Angeles.
   ``It reminds me of Lake Michigan,'' said Moody, who learned to
windsurf in Chicago.
   The icy weather paralyzed citrus growers in Arizona and
California, dreading the deadly effects of frost.
   ``We're frightened, and all we can do is sit and watch,'' said
Todd Burden, part-owner of B&amp;B Farms in Mesa, Ariz.
   In the Midwest, paralyzing cold weather stopped cars in their
tracks while ice- and snow-covered highways made travel
treacherous. Scores of people were injured in weather-related
accidents and thousands were stranded.
   The most recent storm-related death was reported Friday
afternoon, where a Mississippi twister knocked a tree into a house
and killed a man. One person was killed in Montana when two cars
collided in a cloud of snow thrown up by a snow plow.
   Up to 50 families in Pocatello, Idaho, were evacuated from their
homes Friday when overnight temperatures that dipped to 17-below
created ice jams that caused the frozen surface of Portneuf River
to rise more than 4 feet in two hours.
   Schools were closed in many states, giving children an extended
Christmas holiday. Sports events in New Mexico, South Dakota and
Wisconsin were canceled to keep students off the roads at night.
   In Cavalier, N.D., four men trapped in a stalled jeep resorted
to burning Christmas wrapping paper to keep warm as the
wind-chilled temperature fell to 80 below.
   ``Nobody knows why we weren't injured,'' said passenger Mark
Sagert. ``I was facing death and I knew it. I was thinking about my
wife and family.''
   In Belt, Mont., rancher Frank Urick had to hitch a team of
horses to a sleigh to haul feed to livestock when his pickup truck
froze up.
   ``All I have to do is give them a bucket of oats,'' he said.
``It's not as comfortable as it would be in the cab of a heated
pickup, but we manage to get by.''
   In central Mississippi, a tornado ripped through Vaiden,
destroying 10 houses, downing trees and injuring 15 people. About
3,000 homes in southern Oregon were left without power when a
natural gas supply system failed Friday.
   Utility officials said it would take as long as four days to
restore gas to all of the homes, and there was a run on electric
heaters in the interim.
   ``I tried to buy an electric heater and started calling all over
town and they said they were sold out hours ago,'' said Trudy Bache
of Grants Pass, Ore.

   Soviet troops goose-stepped away from a memorial
to victims of World War II for the last tme Saturday as they
handed over control of an enclave in western Berlin to civilians.
   Several hundred people watched a Soviet honor guard escort the
final two-man watch away from the large memorial in Tiergarten, the
sprawling park just west of the Brandenburg Gate, which used to
mark the division of East and West Berlin.
   Soviet officers and Berlin legislators laid wreaths before the
memorial and bands played the national anthems of the Soviet Union
and Germany.
   The mayor of the Tiergarten borough, Wolfgang Naujokat, said
civilian police would guard the monument and it would be kept as it
is - including the two old Soviet tanks and two artillery pieces
that were part of the Red Army's advance into Berlin in 1945 as
Nazi Germany fell to the Allies.
   After the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the monument became an
odd Soviet enclave 500 yards inside West Berlin where the guards
had to be relieved by convoy.
   The end of the Soviet guardpost at the memorial was a provision
of the Soviet-German treaty of friendship and cooperation signed
Nov. 9 - the first anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall -
by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.

<HEAD>Cheney: If Deadline Ignored War Likely Would Come Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney hopped
atop a tank Saturday to tell desert-weary but eager Marines war
likely would come soon after Jan. 15 if Saddam Hussein ignores an
ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Cheney did not say whether he meant days, a week or longer but
he said he and President Bush would not forget that United Nations
deadline in favor of giving sanctions against Iraq more time to
work.
   ``With the press here, I can't get too specific about dates but
obviously we want to get it over with as soon as possible,'' Cheney
said while standing on an M60-A1 tank in the Saudi desert about 50
miles south of Kuwait.
   Still, Cheney, on his second day of pre-Christmas visits with
some of the nearly 300,000 American troops in the region, did
escalate the pre-deadline rhetorical war by saying:
   ``The president is deadly serious when he says the whole crisis
cannot be resolved until Saddam Hussein goes back to Baghdad and
withdraws his forces from Kuwait. ... I would think that soon after
Jan. 15th if he has not withdrawn his forces from Kuwait then we
will be in a position to take military action in conjunction with
our allies.''
   As Cheney was visiting the Marines in the desert and then Navy
personnel aboard a hospital ship and Aegis missile crusier in the
Persian Gulf, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Colin
Powell was making separate visits to troops as well.
   Cheney and Powell have been in Saudi Arabia since Wednesday,
meeting with senior and field commanders to assess the readiness of
the American forces less than a month from the U.N. deadline.
   The trip was thrown into controversy the first day when the
deputy commander of Operation Desert Shield, Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H.
Waller, told reporters U.S. ground forces might not be combat ready
until mid-February. It was his opinion that Bush should put any
attack plans on the shelf until the entire deployment, still
awaiting the arrival of more than 100,000 Army ground forces, was
ready.
   Cheney and Powell refused throughout the week to comment on
Waller's remarks, but their hawkish pep talks to troops appeared
designed to convince Saddam, in case Waller made him think
otherwise, that the deadline still carried a military threat.
   ``We will be ready, whenever the president says go, to do
whatever has to be done,'' Cheney told sailors aboard the USS
Bunker Hill after seeing a demonstration of its guns and firing a
dozen rounds into the gulf himself. ``We're ready today if we have
to do something, obviously.''
   Bush, meanwhile, said that U.S. forces are battle ready.
   ``If there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now, the
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously,'' Bush said from
Camp David, Md.
   Cheney told the Marines who have been in the desert since
August, when the American deployment was just beginning, that they
now had plenty of help.
   ``We've got enormous forces deployed here in Saudi Arabia and
we're prepared to use them,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney appeared to have the remarks of the Army's Waller in mind
when a Marine asked him about the readiness dispute and said many
homesick Marines ``prefer to go to war and get it over with.''
   Said Cheney: ``We always knew the Marines were going to be ready
before the Army was.''
   And again later, when a Navy sailor asked about reports American
forces were not ready to fight, Cheney said, ``The Army may be a
little slow but we know the Navy's ready.''
   But one of the Marine unit's senior officers, Brig. Gen. Tom
Draude, said he concurred with Waller's assessment.
   ``I don't think you should initiate something as serious as
combat until you have got everything you possibly can,'' Draude
said.
   Cheney watched the Marines practice tank-killing by light
infantry, donning chemical protective suits and decontaminating
tanks and other armored vehicles.
   He promised them that if Saddam used chemical weapons, ``our
response will be absolutely overwhelming.''
   After a helicopter trip over the gulf - and past several vital
Saudi oil installations being defended by American forces - Cheney
toured the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships send to the
Mideast, before finishing his day with a stop on the Bunker Hill.

   Even in the Saudi desert, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney can't resist taking a swipe at his former
line of work.
   The former Wyoming congressman told troops Friday that there
won't be any interference from Washington if war erupts - not even
from a Congress the Bush administration at times criticizes for
meddling in its Persian Gulf policy.
   Would Congress be behind the president in event of war?, Cheney
was asked.
   ``Congress is always way behind the president,'' he answered,
throwing his arm over his shoulder and pointing backwards. Then
Cheney delivered his kicker:
   ``I used to be in Congress before I found honest work.''

   Army Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H. Waller plopped himself into the center
of a major controversy last week when he said American ground
troops in Saudi Arabia probably won't be combat ready until
mid-February.
   That's a month after the U.N. deadline for Saddam Hussein to
pull his army from Kuwait, and Waller's message ran counter to the
tough-talking approach the Bush administration was taking in trying
to convince Saddam he'd best meet the U.N. ultimatum.
   Waller's comments might make him appear a dove, trying to find
an excuse to avoid combat. He wanted to make sure reporters knew
otherwise, so he ended his candid interview session by passing
around a copy of a favorite passage.
   From John Stuart Mill, it reads:
   ``War is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things. The
decayed and degraded state ... which thinks nothing is worth war is
much worse. A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight,
nothing he cares more about than his personal safety, is a
miserable creature who has no chance of being free.''

   First came questions about whether the United States was ready
to attack Iraq. Then another about the depth of Arab support for
the anti-Iraq coalition.
   The next Marine to ask Defense Secretary Dick Cheney a question
had something else in mind.
   ``Who do you think is going to be in the Super Bowl this year,
sir?'' the lance corporal asked.
   Cheney quickly entered his home team, the Washington Redskins.
   His second choice was the San Francisco 49ers, but Cheney
quickly realized he couldn't stick with it - both the Redskins and
the 49ers are in the National Football Conference so only one could
make the Super Bowl.
   So he threw the question to the crowd.
   ``Buffalo'' was the first shout. Cheney nodded in approval.
   ``Houston,'' came from the back of crowd.
   Ever the politician, Cheney decided to stay out of the debate,
shrugging his shoulders and moving on to the next question.

   An Army GI was having trouble the other day telling a girlfriend
back home why she should send a care package not to him but to a
friend stationed in the northern Saudi desert.
   ``Mike's got it a lot tougher than me,'' was how the GI put it
at first during a phone conversation with his girlfriend.
   Indeed.
   The GI was calling from an official Saudi government guest
house, inside the walled confines of an ornate palace complex where
two Saudi kings have lived.
   Just outside the room from which the GI was calling hangs a
two-story high crystal chandelier. And everywhere you look is
opulence - marble, crystal, huge fountains, art works.
   Either reluctant to describe all this or finding it difficult to
find the right words, the soldier put it this way:
   ``I'm doing OK. I'm in a city better than Albuquerque.''

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq called off the second half of a civil
defense drill on Saturday, and local newspapers said officials
planned an exercise to evacuate the entire capital at a later date.
   Officials had planned to evacuate the city's western half, which
has 2 million residents, in a drill similar to one held on Friday.
   No explanation for the delay was given.
   However, Friday is the Moslem holiday, so government offices and
schools were closed anyway. A drill on Saturday would have meant a
shutdown.
   Interior Minister Samir Mouhamad Abdul-wahab said the results of
Friday's exercise were ``encouraging.''
   In that drill, hundreds of thousands of residents from east of
the Tigris River were transported by private automobiles and buses
to locations north, east and south of the city for several hours.
   ``We are proud of the results of the drill and we are confident
that more drills will be held,'' the army daily, Al-Qaddissiya
quoted Abdul-wahab as saying.
   The interior minister, who is also head of the main civil
defense committee, said blackout drills would be held in Baghdad
and other cities. No dates for those, or for the evacuation of the
entire capital, were given.
   The civil defense commitee was set up a few weeks ago to prepare
the poulation for a possible war.
   The U.N. Security Council has authorized the use of ``all
necessary means'' to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait if it does not
withdraw from the emirate by Jan. 15.

   President Bush, contradicting a top
military commander, said Saturday allied forces in the Persian Gulf
are prepared to deal ``vigorously'' with any Iraqi provocation on a
moment's notice.
   Bush sought to put to rest comments by Lt. Gen. Calvin A.H.
Waller, the deputy commander of allied forces in the gulf, that the
troops will not be battle ready by the Jan. 15 U.N. deadline for
the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait.
   ``If there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now, the
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously,'' Bush said.
   Bush spoke to reporters at his wind-whipped, fog-shrouded
mountaintop retreat where British Prime Minister John Major was his
overnight guest.
   Bush's statement was backed up in Saudi Arabia, where Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney told Marines they can expect to go to war
soon after Jan. 15 if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein refuses to
leave Kuwait.
   ``I would think that soon after Jan. 15th if he has not
withdrawn his forces from Kuwait we'll be in a position to take
military action in conjunction with our allies,'' Cheney said while
standing atop an M60-A1 tank in the desert some 50 miles from the
Kuwaiti border.
   Major, who accompanied Bush to the news conference, left the
clear impression that British policy is no less aligned with the
U.S. stand in the gulf than it was under former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   ``If there is going to be a conflict in Kuwait, that's really a
matter for Saddam Hussein,'' Major said. ``He knows what the
Security Council resolutions say. They couldn't be clearer ...
What's he's done is unforgivable.''
   Speaking later to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base before his
departure, Major said he and Bush were ``entirely of one mind'' on
the gulf crisis. If Saddam refuses to withdraw, ``we are ready to
use force to free Kuwait and restore the legitimate government.''
   As further evidence that all is well in the British-American
connection in the post-Thatcher era, Bush and Major began
addressing each other as ``John'' and ``George'' shortly after
their talks got under way on Friday.
   Bush said the American and British positions are ``totally
together.'' Under questioning, Bush also said the Soviet Union has
given ``every indication'' that its support for U.S. policies in
the gulf will continue notwithstanding the resignation of Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Major agreed, adding, ``our clear hope is that the expressed
direction of Soviet foreign policy and internal political and
economic reform will continue unchanged.''
   Shortly after Waller made his remarks about the lack of military
preparedness in the gulf, the administration began looking for ways
to soften their impact.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Waller really meant
that the forces were not as ready as they would like to be ``for
all contingencies.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested Waller's remarks
were aimed at keeping the Iraqis guessing.
   ``When I was in the Marine Corps, one of the important
principles of warfare that I learned was that it was critical to
preserve the element of surprise,'' Baker said.
   Bush seemed mystified that Saddam has yet to budge despite the
massive array of firepower deployed near his borders.
   ``I am convinced that Saddam Hussein hasn't gotten the message
yet for some odd reason ... a message that all of us are determined
to fulfill to the letter all of the United Nations resolutions,''
Bush said.
   He added that he expected to hear more about the preparedness
levels of the allied forces on Monday from Cheney and chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff Colin Powell upon their return from a
tour of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.
   Besides the gulf, Bush and Major discussed the impact of the
Shevardnadze's resignation, the NATO alliance in the post-Cold War
era and efforts to revive the global trade talks, which collapsed
two weeks ago.
   Major said they discussed the ``remarkable changes'' going on in
South Africa. ``I told the President and Secretary Baker about the
European Community's decision to lift its investment ban and
expressed the hope that the United States will soon feel able to
lift some of the restrictive measures that they have in place.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Education Department last week placed
new limits on minority college scholarships. Invoking civil rights
law, the department ruled that aid financed from a college's own
funds must be color-blind.
   Yet two months earlier, in a far more liberal reading of those
same statutes, a regional office of the Education Department could
find nothing wrong with Harvard University's giving admissions
preference to offspring of alumni.
   Both rulings by the same federal agency expose an old truth
about college admissions and scholarships: Laws and lofty
principles may be invoked one day to support a desired social end,
only to be abandoned to suit another occasion.
   Confusion reigned last week over guidelines on race-based
college scholarships. Colleges and civil rights groups generally
reacted angrily to the Bush administration's new rules forbidding
the spending of institutional scholarship money to redress racial
imbalances on campuses.
   The ruling, issued by the department's assistant secretary of
civil rights, Michael L. Williams, gave colleges and universities
four years to comply with the new guidelines on minority
scholarships.
   Nearly everyone, including Bush, predicted a long struggle ahead
in Congress and the courts.
   But over the years, colleges and civil rights advocates have
proven no more consistent in their principles than the government
when it comes to promoting campus diversity or creating a level
playing field in granting admissions and financial aid.
   Until the early 1960s, colleges commonly used racial and ethnic
quotas and perverted the financial aid process to limit the numbers
of blacks, Jews and other minorities.
   Yale University, Bush's alma mater, was among the most zealous
of the Ivy League institutions in using quotas and aid denials to
keep their campus white, Christian and wealthy, according to a 1985
study, ``Joining the Club,'' by Dan A. Oren.
   Last week, many of the very colleges that had long used quotas
and scholarships to exclude minority students were now invoking
their right to establish ``goals'' for increasing the campus
presence of blacks and others, and to use race-based scholarships
toward that end.
   According to the College Board, 696 colleges and universities
offered grants and scholarships based entirely on a student's
minority status in the 1990-91 school year.
   The long-simmering dispute over the fairness of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test to minority students displays similar ephemeral
patterns.
   The SAT was first used in 1926, when exclusionary quotas were
the rule. The idea was to create an objective measure to test the
academic mettle of the college-bound - to move, at last, toward an
admissions process that was blind to all but a student's merit.
   Yet, civil rights and women's groups call the exam biased. They
claim that this test, originally devised to open campus doors to
the underprivileged, is slamming them shut.
   And those same civil rights groups that once yearned for a level
playing field for minority applicants now can be heard demanding
special advantages.
   College admissions and scholarship policies have always been
full of inconsistencies, biases and illogic. Most admissions
officials agree that's unavoidable. After all, students are being
evaluated, not machines.
   And the admissions process aims to achieve many goals at once:
an academically capable student body, yes, but also a diverse one
that includes blacks, whites, Hispanics, some superbrains, some
athletes, perhaps a cellist or two.
   The goal of ethnic and racial diversity doesn't always mesh
perfectly with fairness in the awarding of scholarships - and
that's where disputes like last week's arise.
   The latest debate began because an assistant education secretary
ingenuously tried to lend an element of consistency to the awarding
of scholarships by applying a strict constructionist interpretation
of civil rights law.
   But history suggests that such efforts to tidy up this
inherently sloppy business of scholarships aren't necessarily
welcomed, or needed.

   Every child wants Christmas to come more than
once a year. In the Holy Land, it does.
   More than 40 denominations are represented in Israel and they
will mark Christmas on three dates - Dec. 25, Jan. 7 and Jan. 19 -
with rituals that include bonfires, processions and chanting in
Aramaic and Coptic.
   Such diversity also brings discord. Rival Christian groups
jealously guard their rights to the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem, built in the 4th century over the grotto where tradition
says Jesus was born.
   The rivalry led to pitched battles and injuries in past
centuries,and in past decades to fist fights between priests. The
latest argument among clerics concerns which sect has the right to
repair the church's leaky roof.
   Daniel Rossing, an Israeli expert on Christian affairs, said the
squabbling should be seen in the context of Christians fading to a
minority in the Holy Land over the centuries.
   ``When you've lost so much in terms of numbers and power, you
become very protective of what you have left,'' he said.
   ``What we have here is a microcosm of the Christian world. It
may look divided, but we must not forget the vast richness of the
many faces of Christian tradition here.''
   At no time is the richness more visible than during the
Christmas season, marked in the Holy Land more by religious fervor
than by the shopping fever of the West.
   Western rite churches will celebrate Christ's birth Dec. 25, and
most Eastern rite sects on Jan. 7. In Jerusalem, the Eastern, or
Orthodox, churches stick to the Julian calendar, accounting for the
13-day difference from the Western Christmas on the Gregorian
calendar.
   Armenian Orthodox also use Julian calendar, but will celebrate
Christ's birth on the Epiphany, or 12th day of Christmas, Jan. 19.
   The diversity of Christianity is revealed in the many
denominations represented in the Holy Land.
   There are Chaldeans, a Catholic sect with origins in the Persian
Gulf; the Copts from ancient Egypt, and the Maronites, an Eastern
sect based in Lebanon with a patriarch recognized by the pope.
   Others include Greek Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, Roman Catholic,
Armenian, Franciscan, Lutheran, Baptist, Anglican, Presbyterian,
Pentecostal, Mormon and Ethiopian Orthodox.
   Each sect has its own Christmas customs.
   Syrian Catholics pray and sing around a bonfire outside their
St. Joseph's Church in Bethlehem on Dec. 24.
   ``It reminds us of the shepherds who huddled around a fire on
this night, and it also symbolizes the light of Christ,'' said
Monsignor Buttros Abdel Ahad, the vicar-general.
   Anglicans sing carols in Shepherds' Field at Beit Sahour near
Bethlehem on Dec. 24 before midnight services. At Christmas dinner
of lamb and apple pie the next day, a family leaves an empty seat
at the table for a wandering stranger.
   At St. John's Church in Jerusalem, the Franciscan midnight Mass
on Dec. 24 centers on a reproduction of a manger built every year
by brother Claudio Barrato, complete with moving figures and
lights.
   ``Sometimes things go wrong and I have to crawl inside and
adjust it,'' the 70-year-old monk said with a smile. ``The real
thing is the Mass, the devotion. The manger is just something to
help the heart.''
   On Jan. 18, the Armenian Christmas Eve, the Armenian patriarch
enters Bethlehem in a black limousine led by four policemen on
horseback, an honor guard given all patriarchs since Ottoman
Turkish rule.
   Various sects used to hold elaborate candlelight processions
with bagpipes and boy scout troops, but the pomp was dropped after
the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987.
   Most Christians in Bethlehem are Palestinians and Bethlehem is
in the occupied West Bank. Many say they cannot celebrate
elaborately while fellow Palestinians are being killed or wounded
in confrontations with Israeli troops.
   They still hold Masses on Christmas Eve, however.
   The Roman Catholic ceremony is most widely known in the West
because its traditional choir concert often is shown on television
abroad.
   On Jan. 6, there is another kind of concert. The Greek Orthodox,
Syrian Orthodox and Copts all hold services simultaneously in
various parts of the Church of the Nativity, their chants in Greek,
Aramaic, Coptic and Arabic competing vigorously in volume.
   A 19th century code spells out each sect's rights in the church,
but frequent fights have broken out among the Greeks, Armenians and
Franciscans, the sects that act as custodians of the church.
   Confrontations often occur on the traditional church ``cleaning
day'' betweem the Western and Eastern Christmases, since rights to
clean parts of the shrine can imply ownership.
   In one case, some priests entitled to clean the upper part of a
church wall had to use 12-foot-long brooms because of an argument
over leaning a ladder against the lower part washed by another
group.
   Some past disputes were more involved.
   In 1847, a silver star disappeared from the church grotto, where
it marked the site of Christ's birth. Five years of negotiations,
involving French diplomats and the Turks who then ruled Palestine,
were needed to reach an agreement on replacing it.

   Don't ask Macy's. Don't ask Hasbro. Don't even
ask Santa Claus. And don't make any promises to the children. ``Go
Go, My Walking Pup'' is sold out.
   Without the furor that accompanied the Great Cabbage Patch Kid
Shortage, the $40 walking dog has became the hot, impossible-to-get
toy of the Christmas season.
   ``It is a product that is impossible to find. There's not enough
of them,'' said Thomas R. Kully, a toy industry analyst for William
Blair &amp; Co. of Chicago.
   Nobody knows that better than Hasbro Industries, the Pawtucket,
R.I., company that markets the 18-inch, battery-operated white
Maltese on a leash.
   ``Go Go has run out. If there are a handful across the country,
I'd be surprised,'' said Wayne Charness, a company spokesman.
   He said about 300 people a day call the headquarters in search
of the dog.
   They are told that it will be January or February before the
company has more Go Gos, which are made in China.
   ``It's very flattering when a product of yours takes off, but on
the other hand, it's frustrating because we can't meet the need,''
Charness said.
   He would not say how many of the dogs were sold, but Kully
estimated sales at between $15 million and $20 million, compared
with the $500 million in sales that Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtle
figures should do.
   In most parts of the country, it has been difficult to find the
dog since November. Lines formed early outside a Lionel Kiddie City
Toys store in New York when a late shipment of the dogs arrived
about a week ago. They were sold out as quickly as the purchases
could be rung up on the cash register.
   ``We had lines in other stores in 16 other states,'' said Joel
H. Weiner, a spokesman for Lionel Leisure Inc., the parent company
of Lionel Kiddie City Toys and Lionel Playworld.
   Still, he said, Go Go has not caused the kind of stir that the
Cabbage Patch Kids made in 1983.
   The dolls, which are now also marketed by Hasbro, received a
rush of media attention early in their first holiday shopping
season when they became hard to find. The Go Go dog shortage has
gone relatively unnoticed, except by parents trying to find the
toy.
   A spot check of about 20 stores in the New York and northern New
Jersey area found that none had the dog and all knew about the
shortage.
   Karen Kraus, a saleswoman in Macy's toy department, said the
store gets dozens of calls a day asking about the pup.
   Of all the new toy products, ``the hottest is Go Go, I guess
because it does something - it walks,'' she said. ``It's cute.''
   Stores placed orders in June for the dog, which sells for about
$40. It reached the shelves by August and a commercial featuring a
young girl walking the dog made it high on the list of toys wanted
by girls.
   Hasbro pulled the advertising two weeks before Christmas.
   ``It's unusual,'' Charness said. ``You don't see products that
are as incredibly hot as this one is. The toy industry is a fashion
industry. I don't think you can ever really predict what is going
to be the hot product going in.''
   He suggested parents stuff their children's stockings with IOUs.
   ``There will be plenty of Go Gos next year,'' he promised.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, rejecting suggestions
that the allied forces in the Persian Gulf are still not battle
ready, said today any provocation by the Iraqis would trigger a
vigorous response at a moment's notice.
   At the same time, Bush expressed confidence that the Soviet
Union will continue to be aligned with U.S. policy in the gulf
despite the resignation of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   With British Prime Minister John Major at his side, Bush spoke
to reporters on the helipad at his wind-whipped, fog-shrouded
mountaintop retreat here.
   Bush was asked about the comments Wednesday of Lt. Gen. Calvin
A.H. Waller, who said in Saudi Arabia his troops will not be ready
for combat by the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to
withdraw its forces fom Kuwait.
   ``If there was some clear provocation 10 minutes from now, the
allied forces are ready to respond vigorously,'' Bush said.
   When asked about the impact of Shevardnadze's resignation, Bush
said there is ``every indication'' there will be no change in
Soviet policy toward the gulf.
   Major reaffirmed his strong support for U.S. policy in the gulf,
much as he did on Friday in private talks here with Bush and in a
series of television interviews.
   Speaking to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base shortly before
departing for home, Major said he and Bush were ``entirely of one
mind'' on the gulf crisis. If Saddam refuses to withdraw, ``we are
ready to use force to free Kuwait and restore the legitimate
government.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday that Bush
and the recently installed Major are in ``full agreement on almost
every point'' on the gulf situation. He did not say where the two
disagree.
   They agree on the need to implement the United Nations
resolutions on the gulf and that ``partial solutions are
unacceptable,'' Fitzwater said.
   He added that the leaders also expect that Soviet support for
the U.S. position on the gulf will continue notwithstanding the
resignation of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Thursday.
   ``They had a very friendly trip. They are on a first-name
basis,'' Fitzwater said.
   Besides the gulf, they discussed the impact of the
Shevardnadze's resignation, the NATO alliance in the post-Cold War
era and efforts to revive the global trade talks, which collapsed
two weeks ago.
   The Bush administration was distressed when former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher stepped down three weeks ago, but Major
has moved quickly to ensure a policy of continuity, particularly on
the gulf question.
   Consistent with the U.S. view on the gulf, Major on Friday
rejected the notion that efforts should be made to lure Iraq's
Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait through the offer of concessions.
   ``There is nothing whatsoever to negotiate about,'' Major said.
Saddam ``has to go,'' he said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III echoed that sentiment
after meeting with Major at the State Department.
   ``Nobody that I know of is willing to negotiate backwards from
the U.N. Security Council resolutions,'' Baker said. ``We simply
cannot appease aggression. If we really believe that there's an
opportunity for a new world order, we can't start out by appeasing
aggression.''

<TEXT>
   With top Kremlin officials speaking last week of
the dangers of dictatorship and bloodshed, world leaders wondered
whether the Soviets would stumble on their way out of the Cold War
era.
   The stunning resignation of Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Thursday was the strongest signal yet that the
reforms that he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began
nearly six years ago have run off the rails.
   ``Dictatorship is coming!'' Shevardnadze warned from the
congress podium, as Gorbachev and nearly 1,900 parliamentarians
listened in shock.
   KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov warned it would be necessary to
``accept bloodshed if we want to speak about bringing order to the
country.''
   The streets of Moscow were calm, the sky crisp and blue, the
temperature well below freezing. Snow lay on the ground, and
families prepared as best they could to welcome the New Year's
holiday.
   But tempers were flaring in the long lines that formed outside
nearly empty stores. Some spoke darkly of fleeing the country until
the approaching storm blows over.
   Military patrols were checking citizen's documents in the port
city of Klaipeda in the secessionist republic of Lithuania in the
north. In the southern republic of Georgia, Shevardnadze's native
land, the newly elected non-Communist government announced plans to
form its own militia under the republic's Interior Ministry.
   Violence here, revolutionary or repressive, is almost impossible
to control once unleashed, as it has been so many times in the
Soviet Union in this century - and so often in Russia and its
empire over the past millennium.
   The Soviet Union has lost an estimated 40 million people to war,
famine and terror since the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. They know
suffering, and fear it as much as they fear a return to the past.
   Shevardnadze's emotional speech thrust those fears firmly into
the center of Soviet political debate.
   He criticized neither Gorbachev nor the Soviet leader's
proposals to further strengthen the powers of the presidency, a
step that other reformers have warned could lead to a return to
dictatorship.
   But Gorbachev was angered by the speech, which he said caught
him by surprise. He said he had planned to appoint Shevardnadze to
the post of vice president, to be created under his proposal to
forge a ``fully empowered'' presidency.
   Gorbachev's public acknowledgement that he was planning to
remove Shevardnadze from the foreign ministry confirmed fears
expressed by some reformers, that foreign policy would fall into
the hands of Yevgeny Primakov.
   Primakov, despite his apparent loyalty to Gorbachev, does not
carry Shevardnadze's mantle as architect of the end of the Cold
War.
   Since the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait last August, Gorbachev has
dispatched Primakov on diplomatic shuttle missions that were
designed to avoid the use of U.S. military force in the Persian
Gulf.
   Primakov's meetings with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein were viewed
by some Soviet and Western observers an effort to balance
Shevardnadze's clear alliance with the U.S. administration on gulf
policy.
   That alliance offended many Soviet conservatives, who objected
to abandoning a longtime ``anti-imperialist ally,'' Iraq, and to
any use of Soviet armed force in the Persian Gulf - particularly in
league with Washington.
   The military conservatives are led, at least in public, by two
colonels who are members of the congress - Viktor Alksnis and
Nikolai Petrushenko. Shevarnadze alluded to them in his resignation
speech.
   The colonels practically crowed with delight as Shevardnadze
resigned.
   But the reformist newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda lamented that
``now the American versions of Alksnis and Petrushenko have
received evidence that they were right'' in warning that the
Kremlin could not divorce the past so easily.
   The maneuvering over foreign policy, vital to the outside world,
paled in comparison to the titanic struggles being waged over the
future of Soviet domestic policy, the very structure and shape of
the nation.
   Although Shevardnadze did not criticize Gorbachev or his efforts
to strengthen the presidency, he clearly intended his speech as a
rallying cry to what he called the ``scattered'' forces of reform.
   Other reformers took up where Shevardnadze left off.
   ``Reactionaries, centralists, and imperialists have united and
are on the attack,'' Ukrainian delegate Vladimir Chernyak told the
congress Friday.
   ``At the head of the coup stands Gorbachev. It's possible he
himself doesn't know it,'' said Chernyak. ``By demanding for
himself more and more powers, he is creating the legal basis for a
dictatorship - maybe not for himself personally.''

   Tens of thousands of National Guardsmen called to duty in the
Persian Gulf are being temporarily replaced in some states by
volunteers whose duties include watching over vacant armories and
assisting in natural disasters.
   Usually called the state guard or the state defense force,
groups totaling nearly 10,000 such volunteers - mostly retired
soldiers and sailors - exist in 24 states and Puerto Rico.
   ``We're sort of a has-been force until we're needed,'' said Tom
Anderson, president of the National Association of State Defense
Forces.
   Most have been relatively inactive in recent years, but Persian
Gulf call-ups have expanded the role of these purely state-operated
organizations, said Anderson, commander of the New Mexico State
Defense Force.
   ``We have people from all walks of life. I would say that our
membership is pretty much split between veterans as well as young
people having no military service whatsoever,'' said Commander
Robert Haas of the 750-member Ohio Military Reserve.
   None of the organizations has federal status, although the
National Guard Bureau in Washington, D.C., assists the states in
coordinating their activities.
   The governors can call up the state units to help with disasters
and other activities usually handled by activated Guard units.
   Size, duties and history of the units vary widely.
   Texas has a 1,300-member state guard, and units in Tennessee and
Georgia number about 1,000. Rhode Island's State Defense Force,
created in 1987, numbers just three, and Vermont's 8-year-old state
guard consists of 12 retired military officers.
   The 400-member Indiana Guard Reserve last summer provided relief
and assisted in the cleanup of southern Indiana hit by devastating
storms.
   Last year, the Virginia Defense Force helped with crowd control
at 17 events around the state. It has done search and rescue
missions and is helping a small town develop a plan to handle toxic
chemical spills.
   Some of the units, such as Alaska's, were formed at statehood.
Others were authorized by state constitutions and some formed
during World War I. In Mississippi, the State Guard operated under
an attorney general's opinion until the Legislature put it into the
law in 1989.
   Many units have deep roots in U.S. history. New Mexico's militia
traces its beginnings to an organization know as ``Los Vecinos''
(the neighbors), dating back to 1606, when the Spanish explored the
Rio Grande valley. Georgia's State Defense Force traces its
heritage to a colonial militia organized in the Massachusetts Bay
Colony in 1636.
   In Michigan, the recruitment of military retirees begins in
earnest next month. The Michigan Emergency Volunteers is
re-emerging, after having florished during the two world wars
before being disbanded in 1946.
   ``We've had it before,'' said retired Brig. Gen. Warren
Lawrence, who will oversee the organization. ``It's something that
really should be in place, at least in skeletal fashion to activate
on a needs basis.''
   Much of the state guards' work right now is voluntary. None has
been called to duty by executive orders of governors. In few
states, if activated by the governor, state units would get the
same pay as National Guardsmen.
   ``Right now, we're watching over about 55 National Guard
armories across the state,'' said Maj. Gen. Roy H. Swayer Jr. with
the Mississippi State Guard. ``Our volunteers have gone into these
armories as custodians to keep up with what is going on.''
   Members of the Tennessee Defense Force are repairing doors,
helping with finances and generally cheering spouses of mobilized
National Guard troops.
   ``We've gotten an enormous amount of volunteer work going on,
with people assisting units that have mobilized - lawyers helping
draw up wills, helping with family support groups, things like
that,'' said Brig. Gen. Frank Pointer.
   Tom Hegele, a member of the North Carolina State Defense
Militia, said the groups are volunteers in every sense of the word.
   ``At a time like this, there are people out there who wish there
was something they could do to help,'' said Hegele, who works for a
state agency.
   ``This might not be much, but for some people it is a way they
can contribute,'' he said. ``We're telling people who might have
aged out of active service or the Guard to look us over and see if
they're interested.''

   Merrie, merrie Englande is once again planning its
traditional Christmas dinners, largely unaware that the long shadow
of 17th century killjoy Oliver Cromwell hangs over the festivities.
   The staunch Puritan who ran the country between 1642 and 1660
banned hearty Christmas feasting - and no one can say for sure that
the law has been revoked.
   So it may still be illegal in terms of the 1644 Act to bake and
eat mince pies and Christmas pudding on Christmas Day. Cromwell
ruled that these were ``abominable and idolatrous confections to be
avoided by Christians.''
   And woe betide anyone who manages a Christmas dinner of more
than three courses - simple gluttony to Cromwell's Puritan way of
thinking.
   Geoffrey Humphrys, who has spent hours among the statute books
in his local library, says he believes Cromwell's law is probably
still in force.
   ``Some people argue that the Cromwell era was simply a kind of
interim period between the dissolution of the monarchy and its
restoration and that his laws are not to be taken seriously,'' he
said in an interview from his home in North Walsham, Norfolk.
   ``But some are still on the statute book. I've seen them.''
   Fortunately the Puritans' more drastic anti-Christmas measures
did get the chop, according to J.M. Golby and A.W. Purdue, authors
of ``The Making of the Modern Christmas.''
   ``For a dozen years the traditional Christmas festivities were
prohibited: Parliament sat on Christmas day, its soldiers attempted
to ensure shops were open and the churches remained closed while
evergreen decorations were prohibited,'' they said.
   Finally, the good and aggrieved men of Kent marched in support
of Christmas jolliness. Ten thousand signed a resolution that ``if
they could not have their Christmas day, they would have the king
back on his throne.''
   With the restoration of the monarchy after Cromwell, most
Christmas customs were legalized once again.
   According to Golby and Purdue, the Puritans objected to
Christmas celebrations because the holiday was rooted in pagan
worship.
   Ancient Britons celebrated Dec. 25 as The Birthday of the
Unconquered Sun, marking the death of the old year and the
beginning of the new.
   But Cromwell wasn't the only spoilsport in English history who
tampered with Christmas, Humphrys has discovered.
   The Holy Days and Fasting Days Act of 1551, never revoked
according to Humphrys' research, makes it illegal to skip church on
Christmas Day and there are penalties for those who have ``no
lawful or reasonable excuse to be absent.''
   This law, he says, also obliges worshipers to walk to church and
back. Other exercise is largely forbidden: the only sports allowed
by the Lawful Games Act of 1541 are archery, leaping and vaulting,
according to Humphrys.
   An Act of 1625 decrees that footballers may kick a ball around,
but only in their own back yards, as ``there shall be no meetings,
assemblings or concourses of people out of their owne parishes for
any sporte or pastime whatsoever.'' That law is still rigorously
enforced.
   There is also no chance of going out and shooting the extra
pheasant if unexpected guests arrive. A law enacted in 1831 says
the only legal use of a weapon on Christmas Day is in defense of
the realm or in self defense, says Humphrys.
   The office of the Lord Chancellor, chief legal officer of
England and Wales, was tickled by Humphrys' Christmas thesis.
   ``We don't really have an expert on this subject,'' said a
spokesman, cloaked as always in anonymity. ``Obviously, it's a bit
obscure.''
   However, he said it was quite likely Humphrys was correct. ``If
something is in the Statutes in Force book, it is still the law, no
matter how old it is.''
   However, legislation of 1831 stipulates nobody can be arrested
for anything but serious crime or breach of the peace on Dec. 25,
Humphrys said.
   And anyway, he adds, policemen should not be on the beat on
Christmas Day.
   A law promulgated under King Charles II in 1677 state that
``noe servant, artificer, workeman, labourer or other person
whatsoever shall do or exercise any worldly labours, business or
worke of their ordinary callings'' on that day.

   Six robed Ku Klux Klan members gathered in a
downtown plaza today and were met by 1,500 people who shouted down
their speeches and threw objects at them, police said. Seven people
were arrested.
   Police sprayed Mace to stop protesters who charged them as they
escorted the Klansmen to a nearby building after the 45-minute
rally in Fountain Square.
   A demonstrator who threw something at one of the Klanman's cars
as they drove off was among those arrested on charges of disorderly
conduct. At least one fist fight broke out in the crowd.
   ``It was getting ugly real quick,'' said Assistant Police Chief
Edward Ammann.
   He said police recovered 40 to 50 objects the protesters threw
during the rally, including rocks, ball bearings, pieces of
machinery and a two-pound can of sliced pineapple.
   ``It's one of the more serious demonstrations that we've had,''
Police Chief Lawrence Whalen said.
   One fire captain was injured when he was struck in the arm by a
thrown object, Whalen said. No other injuries were reported.
   The Klansmen, barred by a City Council directive from concealing
their faces behind hoods, erected a 10-foot wooden cross in the
square, which is decorated with Christmas trees, as protesters
shouted ``Death to the Klan!''
   City officials cited safety concerns in denying the Klan
permission to set fire to the cross.
   A Klansman began the rally by holding up a Bible and yelling,
``Life, life through Jesus!'' But when the speaker grabbed a
bullhorn, jeers and taunts drowned out the rest of his address.
   ``America loves ignorant idiots,'' one heckler yelled.
   ``It's a damn shame the city is protecting them,'' shouted
another.
   Police had said they did not expect a large turnout of Klan
members. ``The history of these things is if you have two dozen
Klansmen there, you'll have a lot,'' Ammann said.
   The U.S. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, based in Hamilton, had
planned to have several speakers at the rally. Ron Lee, the group's
imperial vice president, had said he wanted no violence.
   As ordered by the city, the Klansmen removed the cross after the
rally because the city opposes leaving religious symbols on the
square. City lawyers have said Cincinnati wants to avoid legal
debates about government entanglement with religion.
   The Klan obtained the rally permit after a federal judge allowed
a Jewish congregation to put a menorah on the square for the full
eight days of Hanukkah.
   City Council members on Wednesday enacted a ban on wearing hoods
or masks on public property, saying they were concerned about the
possibility of violence. Violation of the ordinance is punishable
by up to of 30 days in jail and a $250 fine.
   Councilman Nick Vehr, who proposed the ordinance, said police
need it to identify lawbreakers. Vehr modeled the ban on a
39-year-old Georgia law, which was upheld by that state's Supreme
Court this year.
   Lee had said that after going ahead with its rally, the Klan
would file a lawsuit in federal court challenging the new ordinance
as a violation of members' civil rights.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS JOHN F. KENNEDY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instead of getting married
over the Christmas holidays, Navy Lt. Dan Turner will be practicing
combat tactics in his A-7 light attack aircraft.
   Petty Officer 2nd Class Joseph Roberts desperately wants to
spend Christmas with the 3-month-old son he's never seen. But he'll
be repairing jet engines.
   Trying to cope with his first Christmas away from his family,
Fireman Apprentice Deval Sanders will spend the day helping to run
the generators on the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy, a
prospect he finds ``very depressing.''
   Eight Christmas trees have been flown to the carrier in the
northern Red Sea. The catapult shuttle that hurls the attack jets
and fighters into flight has been painted with the words ``Merry
Xmas.'' The American public has overwhelmed the ship with Christmas
cards and goodies.
   But even with the trimmings, much of the traditional holiday
spirit will be missing for the 5,200 sailors and fliers on the
Kennedy who know they could be at war with Iraq within weeks.
   Capt. John P. Gay, a decorated Vietnam War combat pilot who took
command of the 82,000-ton carrier earlier this month, has decided
that Christmas is going to be a regular working day.
   That means most of the 70-odd strike aircraft on the carrier
will be flying, which will leave few sailors much time to dwell on
war, peace or family celebrations back home.
   Capt. Jim O'Connor, the carrier's chief chaplain, said it would
be a low-key Christmas.
   ``You don't want to overdo it because guys are trying to work
through being away from their families,'' he said. ``If you overdo
it, you simply deepen the pain, shall we say. It's going to turn
them off.''
   Since the Kennedy is in international waters, Christmas services
can be held openly - unlike in Saudi Arabia, where only Moslem
religious observances are legal. The U.S. military said religious
services for troops in the desert will be held privately.
   There will be a Christmas Eve candlelight service for
Protestants on the Kennedy, midnight mass for Catholics, a
Christmas Day service and a band of roaming troubadors singing
carols from table to table in the mess halls.
   ``There's a certain intensity at this time because of the
possibility of war and there's that matter of separation,'' said
O'Connor, a 51-year-old Lutheran minister from New Port Richey,
Fla.
   ``I myself think this is a time to take Christmas seriously ...
and ask Jesus to be the Prince of Peace,'' he said.
   From the boiler room in the bowels of the huge carrier to the
bridge overlooking the flight deck, there is a sense of unease.
Nobody knows when they're going home. Everybody's life is on hold.
   For Lt. Turner, a 29-year-old pilot from Jacksonville, Fla.,
Christmas was supposed to be spent with his parents in San Diego
and four days later he was to walk down the aisle with his fiance,
Jodee.
   ``We're trying for March 23, but I don't know if we're even
going to make that,'' he said.
   Instead of pre-wedding festivities, Turner will take a break
from flying and join fellow pilots to open stockings sent by the
wives' club of VA-72 Squadron. Their ``ready room'' is adorned with
a Christmas tree, decorations, and a huge card on the wall with
photos of wives, girlfriends, children and pet dogs peeping out of
Christmas ornaments.
   For Roberts, a 31-year-old aviation maintenance technician from
Boston, Christmas is going to be ``lousy'' because he still hasn't
seen his son, Ryan Thomas.
   ``I've seen pictures of him,'' he said.
   Sanders, a 22-year-old damage control apprentice from Michigan
City, Ind., said he knows he's going to be ``a little homesick'' on
Christmas.
   ``I've got to block it out,'' he said.
   Other members of the crew are trying to cope in different ways.
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Janofsky Herrion, 21, of Essex, Mo., a
mechanic, said he's glad Christmas won't be a holiday here.
   ``If we (weren't) flying, we'd just be sitting around wondering
what our families are doing, wishing that we could be there. Our
reality is we're out here and we've got a job to do,'' he said.
   ``It's going to be a special Christmas for me, just because of
all the support we've gotten from back home,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Val
Diers, 33, of Norman, Okla., the maintenance officer for an A-7
squadron.
   Speaking of the gift packages, he said: ``I'm convinced by the
end of this cruise I will have gained 20 pounds and all my teeth
will have fallen out - it's that bad.''

<HEAD>Answer to Sugar Shortages in Iraq: Dates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALAH NASRAWI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resourceful Iraqi bakers may have found one
answer to shortages of sugar caused by the U.N. sanctions imposed
against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.
   Dates are the Iraqis' favorite winter fruit. But they have
rarely tried to turn them into desserts.
   Now, though, confectionaries are now making date-based sweets
instead of the traditional, richer sweets that require plenty of
sugar, flour and fat to make.
   The younger generations have heard about a delicacy called
madgoga from their grandmothers, but a few have tasted the sweet.
   Madgoga ``is cheap and easy to make. I wonder why we had
forgotten it and have only remembered our best traditional sweets
in this hour of crisis,'' said Abdul Hussein Jawad, whose family is
a well-known Baghdad sweetmaker.
   Jawad said he makes madgoga by adding sesame paste to ground
dates. Sometimes he adds nuts and coconuts to make it tastier and
more nourishing.
   Dates and milk constituted the staple diet of Bedouin tribes in
the desert, mainly because the fruit is rich in vitamins and milk
prevents dehydration.
   Madgoga was rediscovered after sweets shops were forced to close
in the wake of international sanctions that followed the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The embargo has forced the government to ration food items
including cooking oil, flour, milk and sugar. These items have
disappeared from the markets, but families receive limited
quantities from government centers.
   Iraq claims that more than 2,000 children under age 5 have died
because of shortages in medicines and baby food that followed the
U.N. embargo. Diplomats say there are no serious shortages of basic
medicines.
   Iraq, the world's leading producer of dates, used to provide
international markets with more than 80 percent of its supplies.
Under the U.N. trade embargo, Iraq was expected to lose about $50
million in date exports this year.
   The country produces 300 kinds of dates but exports about 20
varieties, keeping the rest for domestic consumption.

<DATELINE>HAIFA, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery recalls
waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to
the USS Saratoga and joking, ``Whoa, looks like we're flooding.''
   Only minutes later, his words came true, turning a simple ride
back from Christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive.
   The Israeli ferry Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on
Saturday, throwing more than 100 men into the cold waters of Haifa
Bay. At least 19 sailors drowned, and scores were injured. The
sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against Iraq.
   Vickery, 33, was among four American sailors interviewed at
Haifa's Rambam Hospital. He is from Jacksonville, Fla., is not far
from Mayport, the Saragota's home port.
   Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over
the stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a big
wave.
   Vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had
cracked his joke.
   ``All of a sudden, I saw water just come flying in,'' he said.
``And it was maybe two seconds, and the boat rolled right over.''
   The 13-year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferry's
cabin, frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank.
   ``I started breathing in water and almost died,'' Vickery said.
``If I had been under the water maybe another 30 seconds, I
wouldn't be lying here right now. I'd be in one of those body bags
out there.''
   When he made his way to the surface he found ``guys floating
everywhere, screaming and yelling like chaos.''
   Despite his own predicament, he grabbed a struggling fellow
sailor by the collar and dragged him toward a floating, plastic
foam life ring. One rescue boat, already overloaded, passed by and
threw life preservers.
   In what ``seemed like an hour,'' another boat came, also full.
   ``So they just dragged us through the water back to the
Saratoga, and I was a real happy person to see those guys snatching
me up,'' he said.
   As Vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water
inhalation, his hospital roommate, Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, of
San Antonio, Texas, was recovering from a neck injury suffered when
a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water.
   Both were wearing blue hospital pajamas and, when they walked to
the visiting room's balcony could see the Saratoga anchored outside
the Haifa harbor.
   Benjamin, who has been in the navy for just a year, said the
ferry had been jostled in heavy seas.
   ``As we were going on the waves, I just noticed one that was
bigger than normal and then another one that was bigger than
normal,'' he said. ``The next thing I know, all I saw coming in was
water,'' he said.
   Benjamin said he dove from the ferry, then had to swim
frantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat.
   Clinging to a foam plastic float, he was passed by one rescue
boat and hit by a second.
   ``I looked around and I see this big hull coming at me and we
were all yelling, but I guess the ship didn't see us,'' he said.
``I was trying to get out of the way, but I got hit by the ship.''
   Dazed, Benjamin stripped off his jacket, shirt and shoes and
kept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to cling
to.
   ``I was scared,'' he admitted. ``I was having a hard time
staying up in the water.''
   A rescue ship picked him up, he estimated, about a half hour to
45 minutes later.
   Two other men interviewed at Rambam Hospital identified
themselves as Technician John Richards, 31, of Twin Lake, Mich.,
and Airman Lamont Jones, 20, of Claremont, Va.
   Both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks.
   Richards recalled seeing a large wave and feeling the ship
heeling to one side.
   ``All I can remember thinking is, `Oh my God, it's sinking,' and
then I was scrambling for my life,'' he said faintly.

<HEAD>Big Business For Airlines, Moving Companies As U.N. Deadline Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN MARRIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Throughout the Persian Gulf region,
airline tickets are selling out and moving companies are busy
packing as foreigners rush to leave before the Jan. 15 deadline for
Iraq to leave Kuwait or face possible force.
   Britain, Ireland, Sweden and New Zealand are among countries
that have recently advised dependents of nationals working in
Bahrain, neighboring Qatar and parts of Saudi Arabia to leave the
region before the deadline expires.
   Travel agencies are being flooded with calls as thousands try to
purchase air tickets - either because they're leaving soon, or as a
precaution in case they have to leave later.
   ``The phones are ringing all the time,'' said Bill Horsley,
sales manager at Bahrain's Kanoo Travel Agency, one of the largest
in the region.
   Horsley said companies were booking seats in blocks on some
flights to Europe and other points to ``make sure that their people
are protected.''
   Airlines and travel agents surveyed in Bahrain said flights to
Britain, the Philippines, India and Egypt were fully booked from
about Jan. 4 through Jan. 15, with long waiting lists. In some
cases the lists are so long they've been closed off.
   ``I wouldn't say there's panic, but concern is spreading,''
Horsley said.
   He added that many of those who have reserved seats may not use
them after all, citing the period immediately following the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, when about half the passengers who bought
tickets out of the region later sent them back for refunds.
   The British community in Bahrain is down from around 9,000
before the invasion to 4,500, and numbers are still falling
following the British government's advice that all dependents
should leave by Jan. 15.
   There about 750 U.S. nationals in Bahrain. The U.S. government
has not advised citizens to leave, and embassy officials say there
is no immediate sign of an American exodus.
   The officials have assured Americans that they will be protected
in case of war and evacuated if necessary.
   About half of this island nation's 500,000 inhabitants are
expatriates.
  So far, India, Pakistan, the Philippines and other Third World
nations that provide the bulk of the expatriate work force in
Bahrain have not advised their citizens to leave.
   The foreign exodus from Bahrain does not appear to be as
pronounced as in eastern Saudi Arabia. There, the great majority of
Westerners are reported to be leaving, except for those in
essential jobs.
   The U.S. community, mainly oil workers and their families, has
shrunk from 12,000 people to 8,000 in recent weeks and the exodus
is expected to accelerate before Jan.15.
   Among those Britons planning to stay in Bahrain with his family
is Richard Warnes, a senior engineer at the state-run electricity
company who has been in the country for 12 years.
   ``When the shooting starts the first thing that will happen is
Bahrain airport will be closed and we'll be stuck here,'' said
Warnes, 43.
   ``We've decided we'll stay here and sit it out. We're expecting
a shooting war. It's going to be pretty nasty, a lot of troops are
going to suffer.''
   But Warnes expressed confidence in the defensive shield laid
around Bahrain by the U.S.-led multinational force, including
anti-missile and anti-aircraft defenses.
   He acknowledged there is a risk that Iraqi missiles with
chemical warheads might get through and hit Bahrain. But he was
confident that 99 percent would miss their targets or be shot down.
   ``Our main worry is what will happen with the schools,'' said
Warnes, father of a 6-year-old girl and 7-year-old boy.
   As civilians leave the island, schools have been losing teachers
and some are shutting down.
   Moving companies report a heavy workload as expatriate families
ship their household belongings out of the region.
   ``We're seeing more people moving for good, rather than just
sending some of their stuff away,'' said Louise Foster of Scotpac
International Removals.
   Ms. Foster said the company was shipping out dozens of
households a week - and only two households have shipped their
belongings into Bahrain through her company so far this month.

   Boats and a building caught fire at a marina pier
on the Lake Washington Ship Canal early Saturday and three people
jumped into the water to escape the flames, officials said.
   Firefighters had to fight the blaze in below-freezing
temperatures and cramped space at the end of a dead-end street. The
National Weather Service said the temperature was in the teens and
the wind-chill factor near zero.
   The fire was at the Leco Marine pier, east of Ballard Bridge on
the south side of the canal that links Lake Union with Puget Sound.
The blaze was fueled by creosote-treated wood on the pier and by
barrels of flammable liquids after spreading to a two-story
building used by LeClair Marine Construction.
   Firefighters and witnesses said the fire apparently started in a
wood stove aboard a 30-foot pleasure boat moored at the pier.
However, fire department spokesman Albert Smalls said he could not
confirm that was the cause.
   When the flames spread to the pier, one couple tried
unsuccessfully to start their boat motor to flee. The crew of a
police boat told them to jump in the water.
   ``They said bail out, and then they threw their dog in the
water,'' said Kent Ferris, who watched from shore. ``About 30
seconds later the boat went up.''
   Smalls said a third person also jumped.
   There were about 30 boats along the shore, and some burned, with
flames leaping from boat to boat. Smalls said at least three boats
were destroyed. He said damage would be significant but had no
dollar estimate.
   Three people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation,
Smalls said.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Down Dramatically at Refinery, But Not at Gas Pumps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OLNEY, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While crude oil prices have plunged since
October, the sign at Fletcher's Amoco last week still read $1.37 a
gallon for unleaded gasoline, only a couple of pennies less than
when oil prices peaked nearly two months ago.
   And Fletcher's isn't alone in being slow to drop prices. Its
pump price reflects the national average, according to the American
Automobile Association.
   Many factors may be helping to keep prices up, but a major
reason is that dealers are trying to recoup losses they incurred in
August when their profit margin was severely squeezed.
   ``We would like to keep the prices coming down,'' said Bobby
Fletcher, owner of the station along a busy commuter corridor
outside Washington.
   But in an interview last week, Fletcher said he couldn't make
sharp cuts and still keep a reasonable margin, considering what he
pays for gasoline and a recent federal gas tax hike.
   The Exxon station across the street showed the same price, and a
Crown gas-and-go down the road was just a penny cheaper.
   Industry officials say retail prices are, in fact, coming down
and in recent days some dealers have dropped unleaded regular a few
pennies a gallon. Some of that decline, however, has been masked by
the 5-cent increase in the federal gasoline tax last Dec. 1.
   The slow price decline has left many motorists perplexed as they
recall the lightning price increases that took place at gasoline
pumps in the days after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait when
the price of crude oil soared.
   Although crude oil prices have fallen from a peak of $40.40 a
barrel in early October, to about $27 a barrel last week, the price
of retail gasoline has remained almost steady during most of that
period.
   In its pre-Christmas survey of 5,000 service stations, the
American Automobile Association reported Friday the average price
for unleaded regular gasoline was $1.37 a gallon, only 1.4 cents
lower than in the week before Thanksgiving, or about 30 cents a
gallon higher than beore the Persian Gulf crisis began.
   Wholesale gasoline spot prices on the New York exchange closed
last Thursday a penny lower than pre-Iraqi invasion levels, and
crude prices were only 17 cents a gallon higher.
   ``We think it's outrageous,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of
Public Citizen, a Washington consumer advocacy group. She said that
with the current roller-coaster price situation for oil and refined
products there was too much ``opportunity to maneuver'' all along
the line from oil production to retail sales.
   ``They're trying to recoup some of the costs that they claim was
never passed along. But the motorist is at the end of the chain and
... has not had the relief,'' says Richard Hebert, a spokesman for
the AAA.
   But those in the oil industry - from producers to refiners to
gasoline dealers - vigorously deny any price gouging. Their prices
are dictated primarily by supply and demand, they argue.
   ``We're returning to our normal margins,'' said Charles Dibona,
president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil company
trade group. ``The price of crude went way up, the price of
gasoline went up half as much, the price of crude is falling back
somewhat and you're back to a normal relationship.''
   Phillip Chisholm, executive vice president of the Petroleum
Marketers Association, said dealers and middlemen were severely
squeezed in August and September between rising costs and pressure
to keep prices down. ``A lot of them are trying to recover the
margins that they lost,'' he said.
   Gasoline prices never increased as much as crude oil partly
because oil companies heeded the pleas from President Bush in late
August and September to curb prices. Refiners and retail dealers
took the hit.
   According to figures compiled by the American Petroleum
Institute, spot crude prices increased 46 cents a gallon in the two
months after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Refiners on average passed only
33 of those cents onto dealers who, in turn, passed only 25 cents
to their customers.
   As a result, their margin - the difference between what the gas
costs them and what they sell it for - virtually disappeared for a
time. Some dealers reported selling gasoline for what they paid for
it and absorbing overhead costs.
   A few days after the price of crude hit $40.40 a barrel in early
October, wholesale gasoline prices peaked at nearly $1 a gallon. At
the pump, service station owners added on taxes - 30 to 35 cents,
depending on the locality - and transportation costs, plus a
margin.
   According to industry experts, dealers typically want to
maintain a 6 cent to 7 cent margin, which includes their overhead
costs and a profit.
   Retail prices jumped to about $1.38 cents a gallon on average
nationwide in early October, according to the AAA surveys.
   As tensions eased somewhat in the Mideast, the price of crude
began to drop through November and December, and oil companies
began to lower wholesale prices as well.
   Average wholesale prices at the refineries - before taxes and
transportation - were 97 cents a gallon in late October. Those
prices dropped to 77 cents by mid-December, only about a dime
higher than pre-Iraqi invasion levels, according to API figures.
   ``Our average wholesale gasoline price in the 30 states we
market is down about 20 cents a gallon from middle October,'' said
Neal Geary, a spokesman for Amoco in Chicago. Mobil reported that
prices to its dealers have dropped about 8 cents a gallon this
month.
   Those wholesale price reductions in general appear not to have
been matched by dealers. At Fletcher's Amoco, the price hit a peak
of $1.44 on Dec. 1 after the nickel-a-gallon federal tax went into
effect. It has since droppe to $1.37. Fletcher wouldn't reveal his
wholesale price, referring such questions to Amoco.
   ``To some extent you're trying to recoup'' from the lost margins
as crude oil prices soared, Fletcher said.
   But customers are price sensitive and he anticipated further
declines soon.

<HEAD>Combat Doctors May Use Experimental Drugs Without Patient Consent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says Army
doctors in the Persian Gulf need not obtain patient consent before
using experimental drugs on the battlefield, particularly in the
event of chemical or biological warfare.
   The new rule, signed Friday by Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan and Deputy FDA Commissioner James S.
Benson, grants Defense Department requests to waive patient consent
in using ``investigational new drugs'' in ``certain battlefield or
combat-related situations.''
   ``Combat-related'' might mean only the threat of combat, the
regulation said.
   Armed forces doctors, like civilian physicians, normally must
get informed consent before using such drugs. But the Pentagon, in
an Oct. 30 letter to the FDA requesting the waiver, said ``military
combat is different.''
   ``If a soldier's life will be endangered by nerve gas, for
example, it is not acceptable from a military standpoint to defer
to whatever might be the soldier's personal preference concerning a
preventive or therapeutic treatment that might save his life, avoid
endangerment of the other personnel in his unit and accomplish the
combat mission,'' the letter said.
   ``Based on unalterable requirements of the military field
commander, it is not an option to excuse a non-consenting soldier
from the military mission, nor would it be defensible militarily,
or ethically, to send the soldier unprotected into danger.''
   Investigational new drugs are those that have emerged from
formal clinical trials and are being used by physicians who promise
to report results, but have not yet been granted full approval by
the FDA.
   The Pentagon and FDA did not reveal what drugs were involved,
but the Pentagon stressed that ``these are not exotic new drugs.''
   But Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health
Research Group, said Saturday the new regulation was ``an outrage''
because it told soldiers in the field they ``are going to become
guinea pigs for drugs not proven to be safe and effective.''
   Wolfe said there was still more than three weeks before the Jan.
15 U.N. deadline authorizing the use of force if Iraq does not
leave Kuwait. There is plenty of time to have soldiers sign consent
sheets concerning use of experimental drugs, he said.
   ``It is immoral and unethical to force people to go into battle
having them subjected to unknown risks of unknown drugs,'' Wolfe
said.
   The Pentagon letter, which was published Friday in the Federal
Register, said among drugs being considered were a common
intramuscular injector in a different packaging and a vaccine long
recognized as effective against a specific disease but not used
enough to accumulate data needed for a regular drug license.
   Another is ``a drug in common use at a particular dosage level,
but to preserve alertness of the soldiers, we prefer a lower dosage
tablet'' that the FDA has not approved, the Pentagon letter said.

<HEAD>Paper's Apology Calls Editorial `Misguided And Wrong-Headed'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Editorial Recant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of The Philadelphia
Inquirer's editorial in Sunday's editions, headlined, ``An
apology,'' and subtitled, ``The editorial on `Norplant and poverty'
was misguided and wrong-headed.''
   ---
   It's rare that we regret publishing an editorial from almost the
moment it appears in print. And it's rarer still that we feel the
need to apologize to our readers for a misguided and wrong-headed
editorial opinion. But such is the case with the editorial that
appeared in this space on Dec. 12 entitled ``Norplant and
poverty.'' Great pain, anger and controversy have resulted from
that editorial, and we deeply regret our decision to print it.
   Among the people who were incensed by the editorial were many of
the Inquirer's own reporters, editors and members of the Editorial
Board. In the days since it appeared, we have been doing a lot of
listening and soul-searching.
   We realize now that we hastily and foolishly juxtaposed two news
items that appeared in the Inquirer the previous day - federal
approval of the long-term contraceptive Norplant and the release of
a research group's report that said nearly half of black children
are living in poverty and that the situation is getting worse with
time. The editorial posed the question of whether encouraging women
who are on welfare to use Norplant could help reverse this bleak
trend.
   Where did we go wrong? Let's begin with the headline, which
asked whether contraception could ``reduce the underclass'' and
thus aroused people's fears of something far worse than promoting
birth control. Later, we used the word ``eugenics'' as a way of
explaining what we didn't mean, but it only inflamed matters more.
Most fundamentally, in linking the issues of race and
contraception, we left too many people with the impression that our
cure for poverty was to reduce the number of black people. Although
that certainly was not what we meant to suggest, the fact that so
many people interpreted it that way is a clear indication that the
editorial was fatally flawed. Therefore we failed in our effort to
provoke thoughtful discussion on the issue of birth control and
poverty.
   It's true that many single young women lessen their chances of
escaping poverty by having children too early in life. But it's
also true that the very hopelessness of their circumstances often
underlies the decision not to postpone child-bearing. Creating hope
where none now exists must be the main tenet of any effective war
on poverty.
   In the previous editorial we said that women on welfare should
be encouraged, but not compelled, to use Norplant. We suggested
incentives, such as an additional benefit of some kind. Our critics
countered that to dangle cash or some other benefit in front of a
desperately poor woman is tantamount to coercion. They're right.
   We still believe that this new form of reliable birth control,
which is likely to have wide appeal to middle-class women, should
be equally available to poor women who want to use it. But we also
realize - and should have been even clearer about it - that this
has to be a matter of personal choice. We don't seek to limit the
options of poor women, but to empower them.
   We remain committed to a whole host of strategies for reducing
poverty - from better schools to job training to radical welfare
reform. We think education about birth control is important, and if
Norplant lives up to its advance billing, it could be helpful to
many women.
   And we wish we had said it that way to begin with. The earlier
Norplant editorial undercut our credibility and our efforts to be a
thoughtful, responsible and compassionate voice on the complex
issues of poverty. We apologize to those we hurt and offended.

<HEAD>From Electrician to Head of State: Walesa Takes Oath as President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa, who led Solidarity's 10-year
struggle to depose Communist rule, took the oath Saturday as his
nation's first popularly elected president and declared Poland
finally free of foreign domination.
   The 47-year-old labor activist, a peasant's son who was educated
to repair machinery, pointedly excluded his Communist predecessor
from the swearing-in ceremony before Parliament.
   He pledged that Poland would become a stable element in a
peaceful Europe, seek friendly relations with its neighbors and
continue the dramatic market reforms started by the government of
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who Walesa defeated in the
elections.
   Walesa's swearing-in came a decade after he led the shipyard
strike that created the East bloc's first independent trade union,
and one year since he put together its first non-Communist
government.
   ``I solemnly swear to the Polish people that I will be faithful
to constitutional decisions. I will protect the dignity of the
nation, the sovereignty and security of the state,'' said Walesa in
a clear voice, holding up his right hand.
   His wife, Danuta, stood solemnly at his side.
   Walesa did not invite President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
longtime Communist leader who imposed martial law to crush
Solidarity in 1981 and imprisoned Walesa for nearly a year.
   Present instead of Jaruzelski was Ryszard Kaczorowski, president
of the anti-Communist government-in-exile in London. The
government-in-exile was set up after the prewar Warsaw government
was forced to flee the Nazis in 1939.
   Kaczorowski, 71, was received as a head of state as he returned
to his homeland for the first time on a specially dispatched
government plane.
   Handing over the presidential insignia, seals, handwritten
constitution and other symbols of prewar authority in the gilded
Royal Castle, Kaczorowski said the government-in-exile had
fulfilled its mission and could now cease to exist.
   Walesa also accepted the blessing of the church. A Mass was
scheduled in his honor by the Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal
Jozef Glemp.
   Hundreds of people chanting ``Our president! Our president!''
lined the narrow cobblestone lanes of the Old Town when Walesa
walked the short distance from the castle to St. John's athedral.
   He raised his hand in his familiar V-for-victory sign, made
famous during Solidarity's struggle.
   In his inaugural speech, Walesa said: ``The evil era when the
authorities of our country were appointed under pressure of
foreigners or as the result of forced compromises is ending.''
   Poland has known only 21 years of full independence since it was
partitioned in 1795. It was reconstituted as the Second Republic in
1918, only to fall under German and then Soviet-imposed Communist
rule for 50 years until Solidarity took over the government in
1989. Jaruzelski remained as president under a negotiated deal. He
stepped down early to make way for new elections.
   Walesa pledged Poland now would become ``an element of the
peaceful order in Europe.'' He said it seeks good relations with
Germany and its neighbors to the east: Lithuania, Ukraine,
Byelorussia and Russia. He did not mention the Soviet Union.
   He told Poles that Saturday was the beginning of ``the Third
Polish Republic,'' but that they must believe in themselves.
   ``Passivity and apathy - these are the biggest obstacles on the
road toward the well-being of Poles,'' the president said. ``When
we start to work with confidence, the most developed countries will
show more interest in us as well.''
   He promised to stick to the shock economic reform program named
for Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, which he said was a sign
to the world of Poland's ``determination and ability to make
sacrifices.''
   After taking his oath, the beaming Walesa was rewarded with
cheers of ``Sto Lat'' (``May You Live 100 Years'') by
parliamentarians and invited guests.
   Later, he visited the presidential palace, Belweder Palace,
where he received a traditional Slavic welcome in the form of bread
and salt. The former army corporal also received a pledge of
loyalty from Poland's generals and admirals in an outdoor military
ceremony.
   Walesa's critics, citing his dominating personality and reliance
on national symbols, have voiced fear he might become a strongman.
   He won a landslide victory Dec. 9 over businessman Stanislaw
Tyminski. But the bitter election campaign shattered Solidarity's
unity, leaving Walesa alienated from his rival, Mazowiecki, and
most of his former intellectual advisers.
   As president, Walesa is chief of state and commander of the
military. His first task will be to nominate a prime minister to
run the government on a day-to-day basis.
   He must also prepare for elections that will replace the
parliament elected under the 1989 bargain with the Communists that
guaranteed 65 percent of seats to the now-dissolved party and its
allies.
   Walesa said Thursday that he will not name a prime minister
until after the holidays.

<TEXT>
   Jubilant workers in Valencia shut their
factory down early and residents of a modest Madrid suburb flocked
to the streets Saturday to celebrate winning part of Spain's $1.1
billion Christmas lottery.
   The state lottery's top prize was the $236 million ``El Gordo''
(The Fat One) - divided among 90 ticket-holders.
   Since each of the 90 tickets cost more than $250, most were
split among families, friends, club members and colleagues. Once
somebody bought a ticket, he or she could divide it into many
shares as desired.
   Thousands more Spaniards won other substantial prizes in the
annual drawing, which Spain bills as the world's richest.
   About $105 million in prizes was spread about the Madrid suburb
of Alcorcon. Police said extra units had been called to duty to
control heavy traffic as winners began a street party near the
outlet that sold the tickets.
   ``You can imagine what it's like with everyone in the street,''
he said. ``Since the prize was well distributed, practically every
bar is having a private party.''
   The 200 employees of a refrigerator factory in Valencia split
$95 million. Those working the Saturday shift hugged each other on
the factory floor and then closed down for the day.
   The Christmas lottery has been a holiday fixture since 1818 in
Spain, where Carlos III established state lotteries in 1763.
   The lottery awarded a total of $1.1 billion in prizes, including
$236 million for ``El Gordo.''
   Total ticket sales this year were $1.56 billion, 70 percent of
which went to prize money and the rest into state coffers.
   Per capita income in Spain was $8,673 in 1988, the last year for
which figures are available.

<HEAD>Woman Denied Request To Spend Holiday With Parents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman free on bail after admitting that she
tried to hire a hit man to kill her parents will not be allowed to
spend Christmas with them, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy said she sympathized with Heidi
Steiro's desire to see with her parents, but turned down the
request Friday even though her parents wanted to see her.
   Earlier this month, Steiro, of St. Anthony, admitted that she
instigated the murder-for-hire scheme but pleaded guilty to a
lesser charge of making a threatening phone call. She is free on
bail while awaiting sentencing but is prohibited from seeing her
parents, though she talks to them frequently by phone.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joan Lancaster said she has concerns
about the safety of Steiro's parents.
   ``Apparently, Mom and Dad want her back,'' Lancaster said. ``To
be so forgiving of somebody who has hired somebody to kill you I
find quite remarkable.''
   Steiro, 21, was arrested in September after she offered an
undercover officer $45,000 to kill her parents and made a phone
call to make sure they would be home on the weekend she wanted them
slain, authorities said.
   Steiro, who was working as a lab technician at the University of
Minnesota, told authorities she stood to inherit $2 million.
   Her attorney, F. Clayton Ryder, said he will keep trying to
reunite Steiro and her parents, Richard and Gloria Steiro, of
Boulder Junction, Wis.
   Ryder said Steiro was disappointed but understands the judge's
decision.

<HEAD>Ambitious Museum Fails to Get State Certification</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NORTH ADAMS, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was billed as a big idea with big
results: converting an abandoned factory into the world's largest
museum of contemporary art.
   But five years later, the project that piqued interest in art
circles and set hope alight in this struggling mill city has run
into a serious setback. State planning officials refused to grant
full certification to the plans.
   Inspector General Joseph R. Barresi, a vocal critic, said that
as a practical matter that decision will ``close the book'' on the
museum.
   But proponents stoutly deny the project's dead.
   ``We've pulled this out of the fire before,'' said North Adams
Mayor John Barrett III, who's also chairman of the cultural
development commission that oversaw a $1.7 million feasibility
study.
   ``I've been in the game too long to just fold,'' said David
Ross, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and
another commission member.
   The plan to turn the old 28-building Sprague Electronics Co.
factory into the home of huge, minimalist works and other
contemporary art, was hailed at its inception as a way to bring
benefits of the state's then strong economy to a forgotten corner
of the Berkshires.
   But then the state's fortunes dropped, and questions arose.
   ``We can't deny essential services to mentally retarded and
elderly people while we buy millions of dollars of modern art to be
placed out in the Berkshires,'' said state Rep. Greg Sullivan.
   A statement released last week from Gov.-elect William Weld's
office said only that he would take ``a very good hard look at it,
but he feels as though it's going to have to compete with other
projects given existing resources.''
   Among the questions raised by critics of the project are its
attendance projections. Proponents project that the museum would
bring 130,000 people or more a year to the site, at least 2{ hours
by car from Boston. Critics note that that would be more than the
number of people who visit the nearby Clark Art Institute, which
has traditional works of art and has free admission.
   Thomas Krens, who devised the idea while he was director of the
Williams College Art Museum, said he's optimistic about the
project, but he added:
   ``Over the course of the last year, the rules have subtly
shifted in the middle of the game.''
   Krens, now director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New
York, resigned from the cultural development commission at a
meeting this month after members voted to send out a request for
operating proposals from established institutions, including the
Guggenheim.
   At that meeting, its first in more than a year, the commission
approved a revision of the original plan study, sending it on to
the Division of Capital Planning and Operations.
   It excluded hotel and other commercial space and carried a price
tag of about $45 million for the first phase, compared with earlier
estimates of $77 million. A key change was the decision to request
proposals for an operator, a decision proponents likened to looking
for an anchor store for a shopping mall.
   But then the Division of Capital Planning and Operations' deputy
commissioner, John I. Carlson Jr., said he could certify only two
of the five key items, the physical plans and cost estimate.
   Carlson said he could not certify as feasible parts of the plan
dealing with a required 30 percent non-state share of the
financing, management and operations plans, and the availability of
art and money for its installation.
   Carlson's decision was released Monday by Barresi, not Carlson
himself. Carlson followed that release with a terse statement
leaving the door open for a revised plan from the museum proponents
that could possibly meet his objections.
   In his decision, Carlson urged the drafting of a new grant
agreement. It should include such specific conditions as securing a
museum operator and presenting a business plan and five-year
operating budget projection.

   The Israeli city of Haifa is a frequent port of
call for American sailors seeking rest and recreation. Last year,
more than 45,000 sailors attached to the U.S. Sixth Fleet visited
the hilly Mediterranean city.
   At least 19 American sailors were killed early Saturday when a
chartered Israeli ferry capsized as it was carrying them back to
the USS Saratoga after shore leave in Haifa.
   The Saratoga, part of the 6th Fleet, is deployed in the region
as part of Operation Desert Shield, the military buildup launched
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Accompanied by three escort ships, the Saratoga had dropped
anchor off Haifa on Thursday, and shore leave for 1,920 of the crew
began Friday.
   Sailors rescued from the capsized ferry said they had spent
their shore leave having dinner, drinking or visiting discotheques.
   Haifa, Israel's third-largest city, has been a liberty port for
U.S. sailors for about 20 years.
   Despite its mixed Jewish-Arab population, the city has been
relatively unaffected by the 3-year-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Last year, a budget crunch almost forced the closing of USO
operations in Haifa. The USO has a library, a sitting room, a
canteen and an information center. Volunteers help visitors arrange
tours of the Holy Land.
   The center was saved by appeals from the 6th Fleet, the Jewish
Institute for National Security Affairs in Washington and
congressional intervention.
   Many American visitors have compared Haifa to San Francisco.
Biblical Mount Carmel is a backdrop to the city, and steep roadways
lead away from the port.
   The city, with about 240,000 residents, has been continuously
inhabited since the 14th century B.C. and was the site of Elijah's
biblical conflict with pagan priests.

   Here is a brief chronology of important
events in the life of Lech Walesa, who was sworn in Saturday as the
first popularly elected president of Poland:
   ---
   December 1970 - An electrician at Lenin Shipyward in Gdansk,
Walesa helps lead his first strike when protests over food price
increases sweep the Baltic ports. Dozens are shot by security
police. Walesa is arrested and temporarily dismissed from his job.
   1976 - Shipyard again dismisses Walesa for criticizing
Communist-linked union.
   1978 - Unemployed because of his activism, Walesa begins
organizing free trade unions independent of the Communist Party.
   August 1980 - Walesa jumps the fence of the Lenin Shipyard to
take charge of a strike, eventually signing agreements with the
Communist government creating Solidarity, the first independent
trade union in the Soviet-bloc. Leads the union through tumultuous
months as new freedoms sweep Poland and discontent with the
Communist regime grows.
   Dec. 13, 1981 - Is interned under martial law. Released in
November 1982.
   December 1983 - Is awarded Nobel Peace Prize but does not go to
Oslo to collect it for fear he will not be allowed to re-enter
Poland.
   May and August 1988 - Waves of strikes combined with rising
social discontent and a collapsing economy force the Communist
regime to make its first overtures to Solidarity.
   April 1989 - Solidarity is restored to legal status.
   June 1989 - In partially free parliament elections, Soldidarity
wins all but one seat available to it.
   August 1989 - Walesa proposes Tadeusz Mazowiecki as the first
non-Communist prime minister in the East bloc.
   Dec. 9, 1990 - After a volatile campaign, Walesa wins the
presidency by a 3-1 margin.
   Dec. 22, 1990 - Walesa is sworn in as president.

   Marguerite C. Grotte would have gotten her 75th
perfect attendance award at church last year, but that snowstorm in
1917 was a real beaut.
   Miss Grotte started attending the Rugby Congregational Church in
Brooklyn's Flatbush section in 1914 and has made it in every week
since then - except for that one blustery morning 73 years ago.
   On Sunday, church officials plan to present her with an
attendance pin signifying 75 years in which she has had perfect
attendance, said Richard A. Ebbitt, deacon emeritus. That's 1915,
her first full year at the church, then 1916, 1918, and every year
through 1990.
   Miss Grotte, who's believed to be about 80 but refuses to
confirm or deny it, takes the bus to church every week, where she
has served as church clerk since 1940 and as Sunday school
superintendent since 1955.
   She also plays the piano and teaches a class of 5- and
6-year-olds.
   ``There's a great deal of enjoyment attached to it,'' she said,
``and yes, I think I still learn things from the children.''

   He left no footprints on the national scene and
was considered dull as dishwater at home. But Gov. Joe Frank Harris
quietly put his mark on Georgia through education reform and the
historic appointment of a black to the state's highest bench.
   Harris retires next month after eight years in office, to be
succeeded by Lt. Gov. Zell Miller.
   ``The criminal justice system was one of the last bastions of
Old South racism, and his breakthrough there was important,'' said
Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.
   Lowery said he gives Harris an ``A-1'' grade for appointing
black lawyer Robert Benham first to the Court of Appeals and later
to the Supreme Court.
   Harris also sent the National Guard to racially troubled Forsyth
County in 1987 to protect civil rights demonstrators staging a
march against segregation that drew national attention.
   Jimmy Carter's progress on civil rights in his 1971-1974 term
helped him jump from the governor's mansion to the White House. But
national attention wasn't in the cards for non-smoking,
non-drinking, no-cussing Harris.
   ``I haven't been flamboyant,'' Harris conceded in a recent
interview, explaining that the lack of razzle-dazzle in personal
style stemmed from a bit of fatherly advice years ago.
   ``Something my dad used to tell me is that people can spot a
phony three miles away and that you need to be what you are. And
that's what I've always tried to do - to be Joe Frank Harris. ...
Day in, day out, I just want to be what I am.''
   Education reform was the issue that dominated his
administration, but he also doubled the size of the state's prison
system and directed the passage of legislation to bring order to
the state's haphazard growth.
   He kept a lid on taxes for his first term, making good on a
campaign promise that helped put him into office. But he didn't
renew the no-tax pledge to win re-election in 1986, and three years
later presided over the largest tax increase in state history.
   Now, the state is teetering on the edge of a recession-induced
financial slide.
   Environmental issues were particularly troublesome for Harris.
   His attempt to build a hazardous waste disposal facility
rekindled an environmental movement in the state as angry opponents
of the project banded together. The facility still has not been
built.
   Harris, a state legislator for 18 years, was elected to office
in 1982 with the backing of the conservative church vote, a boost
from his no-new-taxes pledge and the support of his political
mentor, powerful House Speaker Tom Murphy.
   Education reform was the persistent dream of the Harris
administrtion. Shortly after taking office, he appointed an
Education Review Commission. The result was a legislative act that
restructured the way Georgia schools were funded, organized and
taught.
   The reform boosted state and local spending for education by 75
percent over five years, and early indicators show student scores
are up. But the state still is troubled by a high dropout rate, and
teachers and administrators still complain of low salaries and too
much paperwork.
   On the social front, his administration reacted to publicity
about the chaotic state of procedures for investigating suspected
child abuse by supporting legislation designed to improve the
system.
   There were modest increases in welfare benefits during his
administration, and tentative steps toward helping the homeless.
   But critics give him his lowest marks for social concerns.
   ``I feel like Joe Frank never did listen to the cries of the
poor, the sick, the helpless or the children,'' said Frances
Pauley, an 85-year-old human rights activist.
   ``I don't think he set us back,'' said Lowery of the SCLC. ``I
just think he didn't drag us forward.''

<TEXT>
   The Syrian-backed Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine reopened its office in Baghdad Saturday, 11
years after it was closed by the Iraqi government following a split
with Damascus.
   Abdul-rahim Malouh, a member of the group's Politburo, said
reopening the office was meant to express solidarity with Iraq in
its standoff against the United States in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Malouh said the Damascus-based group would fight alongside Iraq
if war erupted, but he did not elaborate.
   The PFLP, formed by George Habash in 1967, is a Marxist radical
faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization. It has one seat
on the PLO's executive committee and is the second-largest group in
the PLO next to Yasser Arafat's Fatah.
   Iraq closed down the group's offices in 1979 shortly after
Baghdad and Damascus, ruled by rival wings of the Arab Baath
Socialist Party, broke relations.
   Malouh said the group will maintain its main offices in
Damascus, although he acknowledged that the Syrian government might
not be happy about the group's having an office in Iraq.
   ``The reopening of our office at this time has a very
significant meaning. It means we support Iraq fully and completely
in its struggle against the United States,'' he said.
   Malouh said the group did not consult the Syrian government
before opening the office in Baghdad but Damascus has not objected
to it.
   Syria has committed 20,000 troops to the U.S.-led military
buildup in the Persian Gulf region.
   Habash visited Iraq after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and said
the PFLP would support President Saddam Hussein in his effort to
link the Palestinian issue with resolution of the gulf crisis.
   Saddam has tried to link an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait with an
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, headed by Abul Abbas, has
offices in Iraq.
   Another radical faction, the Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, is expected to open its offices here soon. That group
is headed by Nayef Hawatmeh, who split with Habash in 1969 after a
dispute over ideology and direction.

<HEAD>Bumper Harvest Is China's Good News-Bad News Joke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HEXI TOWNSHIP, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like farmers all over China this
year, Ma Ziwen reaped one of his best wheat crops ever. But the
bumper harvest has brought disappointment for Ma and problems for
the government.
   The official media for months have been filled with reports of a
bountiful grain harvest from the high plateaus of Tibet, where
barley is grown, to the fertile rice paddies of the southeast.
   The crops were so plentiful that free market prices tumbled.
   That meant Ma, a young farmer in northern China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, lost the profits he expected from farming 10
extra acres this year. He'd hoped to earn enough to buy a bicycle.
   For the government, the harvest is like a good-news, bad-news
joke. It had mounted a major campaign this year to increase grain
production and organized peasant brigades to irrigate more
farmland.
   But it found it lacked money to buy the harvest and facilities
to store it.
   The situation is not as severe as in the Soviet Union, where
distribution problems are expected to lead to widespread hunger
this winter despite a record grain harvest. But China does stand to
lose much of the extra grain to spoilage.
   One official estimate is that 42 million tons are lost every
year because of poor storage facilities. This year, the loss likely
will be higher because 33 million to 44 million tons of the 462
million ton harvest are being stored outdoors.
   China last year reaped 448 million tons, equaling a 1984 record.
   Most of China's grain is sold to the state under contracts that
farmers sign individually each spring. They are free to sell
anything they produce over contract on China's small free market.
   But this year's big supply caused free market prices to fall. Ma
said he had hoped to get 1,300 yuan, or $250, for the 2,200 pounds
of grain he had left after fulfilling his contract. Instead, free
market buyers offered 820 yuan, $160.
   Meanwhile, the grain keeps flooding in.
   In late November, more than a month after the harvest, farmers
still were bringing loads to Ningxia's Hexi Township granary even
though it had long since been filled, granary workers said.
   The nearby Tongxin County granary stopped buying after it filled
its warehouse in late October, said granary director Yang Hanyu.
   That's exactly what Beijing wants to avoid. It has ordered local
grain bureaus to buy all grain if farmers do not want to sell their
extra crops on the free market. The government promised loans from
the central bank to pay the bills but the money has been slow in
coming.
   The government fears social unrest in the countryside if farmers
take heavy financial losses. It also fears farmers will refuse en
masse to plant as much grain next year and instead choose
high-profit crops such as tobacco.
   With the population at 1.13 billion and growing 1.5 percent
annually, the government says China must produce at least 500
million tons by the year 2000 just to keep pace.
   China imported 14 million tons of grain this year, much of it
from the United States, but hopes to become self-sufficient.
   Increasing the harvest is not as easy as this year's bumper crop
made it look. Although the state increased spending on agriculture
by $496 million, or nearly 8 percent, officials acknowledge a key
reason for the good harvest was unusually good weather.
   In order to make significant long-term gains, the state would
have to reorganize its agricultural system - something that could
be politically as well as economically difficult.
   It would mean replacing the millions of tiny, family farm plots
with farms large enough to use heavy machinery and well-managed
enough to use advanced technology. It would also mean raising
returns to farmers.

<HEAD>Congressional Inquiry Finds No CIA Link to S&amp;L Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators found no evidence
to suggest that the CIA was involved in the nation's savings and
loan scandal, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee
says.
   Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., made the disclosure Friday in
announcing that the committee has decided not to proceed with a
formal investigation of ties between CIA operatives and failed
S&amp;Ls.
   The committee conducted a nine-month preliminary inquiry
following reports in The Houston Post that 26 failed S&amp;Ls were
either controlled by, or lent money to, CIA operatives or organized
crime associates with connections to the agency.
   The committee staff found five former CIA operatives, but
uncovered no evidence that they used their associations to
``facilitate fraudulent activities at financial institutions,''
Beilenson said in a letter to Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., who
requested the inquiry. Annunzio is chairman of the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions.
   The Post pointed out in a story Saturday that it never published
any allegations that the CIA operatives named in its stories
fraudulently obtained loans by using their CIA connections.
   The subcommittee staff found at least four institutions that
were used by the CIA for financial services.
   But the staff said it could not find any evidence that funds had
been used to support unauthorized CIA activities.
   The Post quoted the committee's chief counsel, Michael Sheehy,
as saying the panel's staff had not attempted to track any S&amp;L
money obtained by CIA operatives to determine if it had been used
for illegal CIA-related purposes.
   Beilenson said that in some cases, individuals claimed to know
sources with information about CIA involvement in savings and loan
failures. But he said they ``either refused to identify the source
or the source refused to be interviewed.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet lawmakers, still reeling from last week's
sudden resignation of their foreign minister, on Saturday put off a
controversial vote on granting more power to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, meanwhile, warned the country to
brace for potential bloodshed in ethnic and separatist conflicts.
He told lawmakers the KGB needs more authority to combat economic
sabotage and militant nationalism.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's parting warning that
hard-line lawmakers were pushing Gorbachev to create a
``dictatorship'' apparently struck a chord, forcing deputies to
think carefully about giving Gorbachev emergency presidential
powers.
   The 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies decided to begin
preliminary voting on the issue on Monday. Anatoly Lukyanov,
chairman of the commission that drafted the amendment on
presidential powers, said lawmakers disagreed on some provisions
and wanted more time to make changes.
   The official Tass news agency quoted Lukyanov as saying some
deputies wanted to ``build anew the whole structure of state
power.''
   Gorbachev is seeking direct control over a reorganized executive
branch of government to deal with a worsening economy and
fragmenting union.
   ``If parliament trusts the president, it should untie his hands
and not hold him on a rope of parliamentary debate,'' said
Lukyanov, who is also a deputy in the Congress.
   Lawmakers did give preliminary approval to a law setting down
rules for holding nationwide referendums. The law would require the
signatures of 2 million citizens before holding votes on any
subject except changing national or republic borders.
   Gorbachev has said he wants referendums held this winter on
whether to allow private property and on whether the 15 republics
should remain in a union. All 15 of the republics have declared
some form of sovereignty or independence.
   The KGB chief warned that the restiveness could lead to
violence.
   ``Today, if we undertake decisive actions to restore order, we
have to accept the fact that there could be bloodshed,'' he told
lawmakers.
   ``We will not avoid more serious consequences if we don't start
immediately to fight destructive forces,'' Kryuchkov said.
   He also said outside forces ``are trying to exert overt and
covert pressure on the Soviet Union and to impose doubtful ideas
and plans to pull the country out of its difficult situation.''
   The KGB chief accused U.S. intelligence of gathering information
on workers' movements in the Soviet Union ``for its purposeful
masterminding'' and of funding ``anti-Soviet formations'' such as
radio stations that attack the Soviet Union.
   Kryuchkov did not say what kind of ideas he thought foreigners
were trying to impose on the Soviets.
   He said some suppliers of humanitarian food aid were
contributing to problems faced by the country, saying that 40
percent of a recent grain shipment contained spoiled or inferior
quality seeds.
   Reformist lawmakers played down Kryuchkov's speech.
   Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin told reporters in
the lobby: ``Yes, there is sabotage, yes there is corruption ... We
have heard all this before.''
   Algimantas Cekuolis, spokesman of the self-declared independent
Lithuanian government, accused Kryuchkov of using scare tactics
that have failed before.
   ``If he is speaking about bloodshed, then it will be him who
causes it,'' said Cekuolis, who was attending the Congress as an
observer.
   Many Congress members remained perturbed by Shevardnadze's
resignation.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, whose own resignation has
long been demanded by liberals, called Shevardnadze's method of
quitting during the Congress ``unusual.''
   ``There is a definite resignation procedure and he should have
taken advantage of it. If I paid attention to criticism, I could
have hanged myself long ago,'' he said, according to Tass.
Shevardnadze had said he was tired of defending the government's
policies.
   Yeltsin dismissed rumors of a conspiracy by right-wing lawmakers
to remove reformists from Gorbachev's government.
   ``This is an invention aimed at aggravating the situation as to
make strong presidential power a necessity. This is the only thing
(the Kremlin can do) to set things in order,'' he said, according
to Tass.
   Gorbachev met with Shevardnadze for two hours on Friday,
reportedly to discuss some way of keeping his longtime ally in the
government.
   It was not known whether Gorbachev intended to ask Shevardnadze,
a respected diplomat and longtime ally in reform, to continue as
foreign minister or to take another post.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vitaly Churkin said Shevardnadze's
decision to quit was ``irreversible.''
   Officials had no further information Saturday about a possible
replacement for Shevardnadze. Presidential spokesman Vitaly
Ignatenko said Shevardnadze and Gorbachev did not speak on
Saturday.

<HEAD>Albanians Hold First Sanctioned Opposition Rally, Union Declares
Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Albanians on Saturday held
the first legal opposition rally in decades, cheering demands for
the release of political prisoners and for more reform in the
Communist nation.
   Also Saturday, the country's trade union declared independence
from the Communist Party, promising to fight for higher pay and
better conditions for workers, a union official said.
   Chants of ``Freedom!'' and ``Democracy!'' echoed from about
12,000 people gathered at the peaceful one-hour rally in Tirana,
the capital. It was called by the Democratic Party of Albania, an
opposition party legalized last week.
   The boisterous crowd, some waving Albania's red flag with a
ouble-headed eagle, roared approval when opposition leaders
demanded the release of political prisoners. Leaders also demanded
freedom of worship.
   The tiny Balkan nation is the last in Europe to be ruled by a
Stalinist regime. On Friday, however, Communist leaders began
dismantling the cult of Stalinism, ordering all statues and symbols
bearing the Soviet dictator's name removed.
   The Communists promised a government change earlier this month,
but it is not clear how far Albanian leaders are willing to go
toward creating a true democracy.
   Albania's new opposition has encountered numerous obstacles.
Opposition leaders say local Communist officials still hinder
activists traveling to provincial cities.
   Journalist Lazar Stani said after the rally that the Communists
had agreed to permit the appearance of an opposition newspaper
twice a week - a major opposition demand. Stani said the paper,
Democratic Renaissance, would would be published this week. There
was no government confirmation that permission had been granted.
   Student protests over conditions in slum-like dormitories
swelled two weeks ago into demands for democracy, and helped force
the ruling Communists to permit other parties.
   On Saturday, police sealed off side streets near the site of the
rally, but reporters saw no arrests or clashes between police and
demonstrators.
   Three trucks with helmeted riot police swiftly appeared when
chanting crowds leaving the rally site got to central Skanderbeg
Square, about a mile away. But the demonstrators moved on when
ordered to do so by police.
   Another police cordon guarded the giant statue of Albania's
Stalinist founder Enver Hoxha, which dominates the square.
   Opposition party leaders urged the cheering crowd at the rally
to work peacefully for democracy.
   Violence and vengeance have scarred the history of Europe's most
isolated and backward nation, and the new opposition wants both to
contain popular discontent and to avoid provoking a backlash from
the Communists.
   The main message from the new party was that Albanians - who
have known only feudalism or Stalinist repression - have nothing to
fear from freedom.
   Economist Gramoz Pashko, a founder of the opposition party,
assured Albanians that they would not suffer in a gradual
transition to market economy but would get the chance to own land
and make money.
   Heart surgeon Sali Berisha, another founder, demanded the
postponement of parliamentary elections from Feb. 10 to at least
April. The February date leaves the opposition little time to
organize against the powerful Communists.
   State television briefly showed the rally on its evening news,
but gave a vague account of opposition demands.
   Also Saturday, the 850,000-member official trade union declared
it would no longer act as ``the lever of the party,'' said Genc
Resuli, head of the union's International Department. The break
with the Communists was approved by the union's 201-member Central
Committee, he said.
   The union also pledged to work for higher pay and better
conditions, including a cut in the working week from six to five
days, Resuli said. Many Albanians say rising food prices mean they
are struggling to manage on wages averaging $50 a month.
   In a development apparently related to efforts to improve the
economy, the state ATA news agency reported the reshuffling of some
posts including the ministries of transport and finance, and the
appointment of a new head of the Albanian State Bank.

<HEAD>Soldiers Kill Arab Attempting to Infiltrate From Jordan</HEAD>

   Israeli troops on Saturday killed a man
carrying a firebomb after he cut through a border fence from
Jordan, the army announced. Jordanian officials denied any knowlege
of an infiltration attempt.
   It was the eighth attempted infiltration from Jordan this year.
   Arab reports said witnesses saw a second man wounded and
captured him, but an army spokesman denied this.
   ``An army border patrol spotted tracks of one individual,'' said
the spokesman, who cannot be identified by name under military
regulations. ``They followed them until they encountered the person
and opened fire.''
   The incident occurred near the Jewish settlement of Argaman in
the occupied West Bank. Argaman is 30 miles northeast of Jerusalem.
   The infiltrator was carrying a firebomb and two copies of the
Koran, the Moslem holy book, the spokesman said, suggesting he was
a Moslem fundamentalist.
   In the last reported infiltration from Jordan, an Israeli
soldier was killed Nov. 13 by a 17-year-old Jordanian who
penetrated an army position near the Adam Bridge near the West Bank
city of Jericho. The teen-ager was captured.
   In Amman, a senior military spokesman said that Jordanian
authorities ``are unaware of any infiltration attempt from the
Jordanian territories into Israel.''
   ``After investigations, our army units... did not find any
traces of any infiltration across the borders,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Also Saturday, the body of a retired Palestinian postal worker
was found in the West Bank town of Jenin, Arab hospital officials
said.
   They identified the man as Yasser Abul el-Assan, 35. Jenin
residents said he was suspected of collaborating with Israeli
authorities but that no Palestinian group immediately claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   The army confirmed the killing and said it was under police
investigation.
   El-Assan's death raised to 322 the number of Palestinians
suspected to have been killed by fellow Arabs since Palestinians
launched an uprising against Israeli rule three years ago. Most
were accused of collaboration with Israeli authorities.
   At least 779 Arabs have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians, and 57 Israelis have also died in the violence.

   It wasn't quite Santa on his
sleigh dashing through the snow, but Prince Charles churned through
the desert dust on a tank Saturday bringing Christmas cheer to
British troops and U.S. Marines.
   A herd of camels wandering along a nearby oil pipeline provided
a biblical touch. But there were no Christmas trees in sight, only
clumps of scrub grass in the undulating sand.
   For members of Britain's famed Desert Rats and half a dozen U.S.
Marines, however, it was Charles himself that made the Christmas
season special, not the trappings.
   ``It was thrilling,'' said Capt. Michael Castagnero, 34, of
Pitcairn, Pa., who spent hours with his soldiers reading a People
magazine article on protocol and practicing bowing their heads in
preparation for the visit.
   ``We have a lot in common because he was married the same month
I was. You watch how his marriage is unfolding - the same as mine -
so it's been kind of interesting,'' he said.
   But Castagnero said that bowing didn't come easily for the
Marines, who are coordinating U.S. air and sea fire support for the
British regiment.
   ``It's usually chest high, head up,'' he said with a laugh.
   British Lance Cpl. Steve Layland of Liverpool, who was a bit
nervous about meeting royalty for the first time, said the prince's
visit made his Christmas. ``He's cool,'' he said.
   ``It really is a terrific boost to everybody's morale,'' said
Lt. Col. Arthur Denaro, commander of the Queen's Royal Irish
Hussars, who were part of the legendary Desert Rats in North Africa
during World War II.
   Hours after arriving in Saudi Arabia, Charles took a 10-mile
ride through the desert on a Challenger tank named Churchill in
honor of Britain's World War II prime minister, who fought with the
Irish Hussars in the late 1890s.
   The 42-year-old heir to the British throne, who only recently
recovered from a serious double break in his right arm suffered in
a polo accident, jumped off the tank with ease and saluted Denaro,
an old opponent on the polo field.
   `At least I climbed on without breaking the other arm,'' Charles
joked about his tank ride. ``I didn't drive it.''
   ``I can salute, which is a great thing,'' he added.
   The prince then shook hands and chatted with several British
tank crews and the Marines, asking about their non-alocholic
Christmas and the Anglo-American language barrier.
   Denaro, who laughingly noted that his army polo team had
defeated Charles' on several occasions, had a serious message for
the prince.
   ``We're ready to go,'' he said. ``We've got some brigades fully
up and running and a full brigade with a division coming in, and
they'll be ready, too.''
   Charles said he was impressed with the Anglo-American alliance
in the desert, where British troops are under U.S. tactical
command.
   ``It's marvelous to see them all in such good form - good sense
of humor, which is what really keeps everybody going,'' he said.
   Marine Lance Cpl. Joseph Horvath, 19, of Oak Lawn, Ill., had
only one regret - that Charles had not brought Princess Diana.
   ``It would have been nice to see the princess - really liven
things up here,'' he said. ``All you see driving down the street is
the Arab women with the veils over their faces and you can't really
see them.''

<HEAD>Report: 100 Soviet Jews Arriving Every Hour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel peaked
in a weekend airlift with an average of 100 newcomers arriving
every hour, news reports said.
   Israel television reported that from Thursday night to Saturday
morning, 5,500 Soviet Jews arrived and another 1,500 were expected
on eight flights by early Sunday.
   A spokesman for the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which
handles immigrant transportation, could not immediately confirm the
figures.
   Israeli officials have said the upsurge of immigration was due
to fears of political instability in the Soviet Union. This was
exacerbated by the resignation on Thursday of Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze, who warned the country was sliding into
dictatorship.
   They also cite the economic crisis in the Soviet Union, and
improved transportation arrangements that allow Jews to fly out of
the former Soviet bloc capitals.
   On Saturday, the Jewish sabbath, the government waived a ban on
flights and ordered the national carrier El Al to use every plane
available to ferry the Jews from Eastern Europe.
   Officials expect more than 30,000 Soviet arrivals in December,
bringing the year's total to about 200,000. That figure includes
Jewish immigrants from Ethiopia and elsewhere.
   In 1949, the biggest year of immigration in Israel, 240,000 Jews
arrived. Officials expect 1991 to be the biggest year of
immigration to Israel.
   Israel's population of 4.7 million does not include 1.7 million
Palestinians and 100,000 Jewish settlers living in the occupied
territories.
   Palestinians are worried the emigres will be used to colonize
the occupied territories. he Israeli government recently announced
plans to build new housing for Soviet arrivals in Arab east
Jerusalem.
   The pace of immigration is causing housing shortages and
unemployment among the immigrants. Israeli officials are fearful
the thousands arriving also will overwhelm schools and social
services.
   In Tokyo, the new U.N. high commissioner for refugees said
Saturday there are concerns of a mass exodus from the Soviet Union
as problems mount there.
   ``I hope not, but there's a great concern among the Europeans,''
said Sadako Ogata, a U.S.-trained professor and specialist in human
rights.
   She added that some officials in Japan are also closely watching
the Soviet emigre situation because of the proximity of the two
nations.
   ``You have to recognize we're neighbors,'' she said.
   Mrs. Ogata, 63, replaces Thorvald Stoltenberg, who recently
resigned to become deputy prime minister of Norway.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Criticize United States in Letter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers Saturday said the
United States has no right to judge Colombia's government for
allegedly taking a softer stance in its war on the cocaine trade.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel, using its pseudonym The
Extraditables, made its statements in a letter addressed to the
U.S. ambassador in Colombia, Thomas McNamara. A copy of the letter
was sent by fascimile mail to news organizations.
   President Carlos Gaviria's new strategy entails ending
extraditions to the United States and giving reduced sentences to
cocaine traffickers who surrender and confess. On Tuesday, reputed
Medellin leader Fabio Ochoa surrendered to authorities.
   U.S. officials have expressed concern the new policy may hurt
regional anti-drug efforts, and the traffickers' letter was
apparently in response to the U.S. reaction.
   The traffickers' statement said the U.S. officials ``are the
only ones in the world who negotiate with drug traffickers.'' The
traffickers said while Colombian drug offenders are given the
harshest treatment in U.S. jails, some American smugglers serve no
time.
   The letter mentioned Barry Seal, a U.S. trafficker turned
government informant, as an example of an American criminal ``who
never knew the jails of the United States.''
   After helping the Drug Enforcement Administration indict several
major cocaine traffickers, Seal was assassinated by the Colombian
drug mafia in 1986.
   Among those accused of having ordered his murder is Ochoa.
   Drug bosses have said as many as 300 cocaine smugglers are
willing to surrender in return for more legal guarantees.
   Thousands of Colombians have died since August 1989 in
drug-related violence ranging from gunfights to bombings to
political assassinations. The killing that August of anti-drug
crusader Luis Galan, a leading presidential contender, prompted the
government's war on drug traffickers.
   The Extraditables also criticized Gaviria's new drug strategy as
``part of a policy of repression against drug trafficking'' because
it requires smugglers to confess crimes.
   The drug barons say requiring citizens to incriminate themselves
in court is unconstitutional.
   Gaviria, in comments published Saturday, said his drug policy
was not a deal with traffickers, but an attempt to solve the drug
problem within the framework of Colombian justice.
   ``We are as committed as we ever were to the fight against drug
trafficking,'' the Washington Post quoted Gaviria as saying.

   About 1,500 people jeered and threw things at
six robed Ku Klux Klan members who staged a rally downtown
Saturday, resulting in one injury and seven arrests.
   Hecklers at Fountain Square shouted obscenities, waved ``Smash
the Klan'' signs and hurled bottles that shattered on the square's
stage as helmeted police formed a barrier to hold back the crowd.
   ``It's a damn shame the city's protecting them,'' one protester
said.
   Police Chief Lawrence Whalen said at least one fistfight broke
out among people in the angry crowd that had gathered in the plaza,
where two months ago thousands had gathered to honor the World
Series champion Cincinnati Reds.
   One fire captain was slightly injured by an object hurled from
the crowd, Whalen said. No other injuries were reported.
   ``I think you've seen an exhibition here of one of the most
difficult jobs that public safety has, of maintaining strict
neutrality between two or three or four factions that have some
very significant points of view,'' he said.
   ``It's one of the more serious demonstrations that we've had.''
   The Klansmen, wearing white, purple and black robes, erected a
10-foot cross in the square which was decorated with Christmas
trees. One Klan member held up a Bible and yelled ``Life, life
through Jesus.'' But when he grabbed a bullhorn to make a speech,
jeers and taunts drowned out his words.
   One heckler in the crowd screamed: ``Your mama should see you.
She ain't never bought you no clothes like that.''
   The jeering intensified when one Klan member held up a sign
reading: ``Fight Racism - Abolish Affirmative Action.''
   ``It was getting ugly real quick,'' said Edward Ammann, the
assistant police chief.
   Those who were arrested were charged with disorderly conduct.
Other protesters, angry over the arrests, went to the Hamilton
County Justice Center and chanted while the seven were booked.
   Ammann said police recovered 40 to 50 objects the protesters
threw during the rally, including rocks, ball bearings, pieces of
machinery and a two-pound can of sliced pineapples.
   The Klansmen, members of the U.S. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan
based in nearby Hamilton, had obtained a city permit to hold a
one-hour raly, but left 15 minutes early.
   Police escorted them to a nearby building after they ended their
event and used chemical Mace to repel some protesters who had
charged toward the Klansmen.
   One protester was arrested as he threw an object and hit a
Klansman's car as it sped away.
   Imperial Wizard Ron Lee said he did not want any violence during
the rally.
   The Klansmen observed a resolution the City Council had passed
Wednesday barring them from wearing hoods to conceal their
identities on public property. The Council citing the fear of
violence in passing it.
   The Klan obtained the rally permit after U.S. District Judge
Carl Rubin allowed a Jewish congregation to put a menorah on the
square for the eight days of Hanukkah.
   The city opposes religious symbols on the square and the the
Klan removed the cross after the event. City officials cited safety
concerns in denying the Klan permission to burn the cross.

<TEXT>
   Families of sailors aboard
the aircraft carrier Saratoga nervously awaited information
Saturday about the deaths of 19 sailors in a boat accident along
the coast of Israel.
   Families were asking ``Why didn't this happen some other time?''
not as close to Christmas, said Cmdr. Jerry O'Connor, senior
chaplain at Mayport Naval Station, the Saratoga's home port. ``We
don't have answers for that. We just don't.''
   O'Connor said a memorial service will be held Sunday aboard the
Saratoga and another service would be held in Mayport, probably
after Christmas.
   At least 19 sailors from the Saratoga died when a ferry taking
them back to the ship from shore leave capsized early Saturday off
the Israeli coast.
   This community suffered a similar tragedy in May 1987 when 37
sailors aboard the Mayport-based USS Stark were killed when the
guided missile frigate was blasted by two missiles fired by an
Iraqi warplane in the Persian Gulf.
   The Saratoga, in the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea since
mid-August as part of the Operation Desert Shield forces, has been
alternating duty with the carrier Kennedy, based at Norfolk, Va.
   ``We're expecting some other kind of casualty and everyone gears
up for something militarily speaking in the Desert Shield operation
- we don't expect something like a ferry boat capsizing,'' O'Connor
said.
   Names of the victims were not immediately released. Three were
from Florida - two had home addresses in Mayport and a third in the
Panhandle, said Capt. Peter A.C. Long, commander of Mayport Naval
Station. One of the injured was stationed at nearby Cecil Field
Naval Air Station.
   At Mayport, the gymnasium was opened up for families wanting
counseling or just needing to talk. About 50 families used those
services Saturday, said Lt. Myrt Yarbrough, director of the Family
Services Center.
   ``They want to know: Is it my husband? Is it my brother? Is it
my son?'' she said.
   The hard thing about dealing with the families, she said, is
``You can't make it go away - the reality that this is happening.
   ``We want to be honest with the people, but we don't want to
raise their fears - maybe unnecessarily.''
   Long said community support had been the brighter side of the
accident, with food and services flowing into the base from nearby
Jacksonville.
   Long said it was too early to determine the cause of the
accident, but said it is common for the Navy to hire ferries in
foreign ports. He said the boats are inspected and sailors are
required to wear life vests.
   ``We go to great pains to try to protect our sailors' safety,''
he said.
   ``I think the circumstances were catastrophic and extremely
quick. There is a great concern about the people on the Saratoga,''
he said.
   A base ombudsman, who asked to be identified only as Christie,
said Navy families and wives are tough, but need help at such
times.
   ``They're scared. They're hopeful. They need a friend. They need
a shoulder,'' she said.

<HEAD>Figure In Catholic Scandal Hospitalized Following Pill Overdose</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman whose affair with Atlanta's Roman
Catholic archbishop prompted his resignation remained hospitalized
Saturday, one day after she took a drug overdose, police said.
   Vicki Long was admitted to the mental health unit at Doctors
Hospital about 6 p.m. Friday after swallowing a large number of
prescription pills at her mother's home, police said. Police
refused to identify the drug.
   Ms. Long, 28, locked herself in a bathroom and left a lengthy
note, said Police Lt. Bill Rawn. The episode was being investigated
as an ``intentional overdose,'' Rawn said.
   The note's contents were not disclosed.
   Although arriving emergency workers found Ms. Long was not in
immediate physical danger, they took her to the hospital for
further examination.
   Police reported that Ms. Long's mother, Vera Long, said her
daughter had been ``under a lot of stress.''
   Ms. Long was ``feeling fine'' later Friday evening, her mother
said.
   Hospital officials would not confirm Saturday whether Ms. Long
was a patient.
   Archbishop Eugene Marino resigned last summer, originally citing
health concerns. Church officials later confirmed his two-year
``intimate'' relationship with Ms. Long.
   Ms. Long also has been linked to two other priests. A paternity
suit she filed against one is pending, although blood tests have
indicated he is not the father of her 4-year-old daughter.
   The overdose came one day after the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of Atlanta released an audit showing Ms. Long had indirectly or
directly received more than $20,000 in church funds.
   The audit showed $5,835 from individual churches went to either
Ms. Long or her creditors for rent, utilities or credit card
payments. It also showed the archdiocese paid $14,556 of Ms. Long's
medical expenses.
   Ms. Long moved back to Columbus from the Atlanta area after her
affair with Marino became public.

<TEXT>
   France is asking unified Germany for reparations
from World War II that the former East Germany had balked at
paying, an official said Saturday.
   The official, confirming a newspaper report, said the move was
in line with October unification of the two Germanys, which gives
the united country the burden of various debts of the former East
Germany.
   In Paris, an authorized source speaking on condition of
anonymity also confirmed discussions were under way, but stressed
they involved claims from private citizens, not French governmental
claims.
   Die Welt newspaper quoted reliable sources saying French
diplomats had spoken several times with the Foreign Ministry in
Bonn about the issue and the French Embassy in Bonn had sent two
written notes to the ministry.
   A ministry spokesman, who refused to be identified by name, said
the issue was a ``normal occurrence after unification, about which
there must be negotiations.'' France had previously been in contact
with East Germany about reparations, he said.
   The Die Welt report said France had put its claim in the
currencies of 1945: 37.6 billion French francs and 261 billion
reichsmarks, the currency of Nazi Germany. Asked how the claims
would be converted into today's money, the spokesman said it was a
technical question for negotiators.
   In the West German currency reform of 1948, 10 reichsmarks were
converted to 1 mark. At that rate, the German currency part of the
French claim would be set at 26.1 billion marks, today worth about
$17 billion.
   The French currency also has been reformed since the war; data
on its conversion were not available.
   According to one estimate, the final claim could rise over $65
billion.
   The spokesman said there would be talks early next year about
the issue.
   When the two Germanys united in October, the federal government
assumed the debts and treaty obligations of East Germany, which
unlike West Germany had not paid reparations to the Western allies.
   After the war the Big Four allies - the United States, France,
Britain and the Soviet Union - assessed reparations against Germany
to be paid in assets and capital goods.
   But Germany was economically prostrate and collection of
reparations was uneven. At the same time, the United States was
pouring billions into West Germany and other European countries in
the Marshall Plan, which helped revive war-damaged economies.
   The London Agreement of 1953 among West Germany and the four
allies permitted the reparations question to remain open until a
final settlement of wartime issues, which has finally happened in
the past year with the unification of Germany and the Paris summit
in November of 34 countries that sought to draw the final curtain
over World War II.
   Die Welt said some of the damages France was claiming had
occurred when French-owned property was seized in the Soviet
occupation zone, which became East Germany. Other claims were
related to forced labor by prisoners of war, restitutions for
seized jewelry and valuable objects, Die Welt said.
   In the mid-1980s, West Germany agreed to pay damages to some
French people who did forced labor or were drafted into the Germany
military.
   Germany is paying reparations to Israel and individual Jews for
the Holocaust. That sum so far has totaled about 80 billion marks,
about $53 billion at today's exchange rates.
   Jewish organizations were unsuccessful over the years in
pressing East Germany for reparations, as the Communist government
refused to accept any war guilt from the Nazi era.
   In another bill from postwar days, Germany is paying the Soviets
about 29 billion marks, or $19.5 billion in grants and credits to
cover the costs of withdrawing 360,000 Soviets troops from former
East Germany - the old Soviet occupation zone - over the next four
years.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of earthquakes shook Costa
Rica on Saturday, shattering windows and sending panicked Christmas
shoppers into the streets. There were no reports of injuries.
   At least six temblors struck, the strongest crumbling the wall
of an empty prison and loosening chunks from the facade of a bank
building. A 1,000-foot-wide landslide block a road west from San
Jose.
   That temblor measured 5.7 on the Richter scale and was centered
near the Panamanian border about 125 miles south of San Jose, said
Bruce Presgrave, a geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   But Victor Gonzalez, a spokesman for Costa Rica's National
University Volcanic Service, put the epicenter at 27 miles west of
San Jose near the city of Santiago Puriscal.
   The quakes damaged businesses and shattered windows at several
points across San Jose. Christmas shoppers rushed into the streets,
some of them crying.
   Five homes were considerably damaged in the city of Escazu on
the outskirts of San Jose, radio reports said.
   President Rafael Calderon called on citizens to remain calm.
   ``It was really a major scare, because it was the first time
I've felt an earthquake of this magnitude,'' said Julian Becerra.
   ``The movement was impressive, even though I don't have much
fear of temblors,'' taxi driver Edwin Otarola said.
   The first temblor occurred at 11:20 a.m. local time (12:20 p.m.
EST), but was barely felt.
   The stongest quake hit the capital eight minutes later, briefly
cutting off telephone and electric service. Another shock followed
immediately. After a fourth quake, about an hour later, people
continued their shopping.
   Two more aftershocks were recorded.
   The Red Cross reported that several cities within 100 miles of
San Jose felt the quake, but experienced no substantial damage or
injuries.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake measuring 5 on the Richter scale is capable of
considerable damage, and a quake measuring 6 is capable of severe
damage.

   Typhoon Russ damaged or destroyed more than
2,000 homes and injured 88 people in this U.S. territory in the
Western Pacific, but no one was killed, officials said.
   The storm, packing wind that gusted up to 150 mph, swept over
the island of 145,000 residents on Friday.
   Gov. Joseph Ada on Saturday sent a letter to President Bush,
requesting a disaster declaration to release federal funds to help
in the recovery.
   A disaster declaration from Bush is unlikely for several days,
said Bart Stinson, a Civil Defense spokesman. There was no
immediate estimate of total damage, he said.
   Electricity and water service had been restored to about 20
percent of Guam by Sunday morning, Stinson said. Telephone service,
however, remained intact because most of the cables are buried, he
said.
   Stinson said damage to Guam Community College, which is adjacent
to Guam University, was extensive.
   ``It looks more like a tornado hit it than a typhoon,'' he said.
   The wooden buildings were splintered and desks strewn around the
campus, where trees were twisted and not just blown down, he said.
   Ada said a preliminary survey by Federal Emergency Management
Agency teams found 341 homes destroyed, 460 with major damage and
1,210 with minor damage to the point they were uninhabitable.
   Hospitals reported treating 88 people, mostly for punctures,
cuts and scratches from wind-blown debris.
   The FEMA teams were already on Guam when Typhoon Russ hit. They
had come to coordinate recovery operations on islands in the
Federated States of Micronesia that were hit by Typhoon Owen three
weeks ago.

   An Israeli gunboat intercepted a Lebanese
ferry off Sidon and seized four Palestinians and two Lebanese who
were on board, police reported Saturday.
   They said the ferryboat Ibrahim was approaching the Sidon port
from Larnaca, Cyprus, when it was intercepted Friday evening.
   The six detainees were taken to Israel, apparently for
questioning on suspicion of involvement in guerrilla activities, a
police spokesman said.
   The Ibrahim was allowed to sail into Sidon after two hours, said
the spokesman. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, is the main base of Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas in Lebanon.
   Western military sources and Lebanese police estimate about
6,000 PLO guerrillas are based in Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh
Mieh refugee camps.
   A PLO statement issued in Ein el-Hilweh confirmed the
interception and said the four Palestinians were all students
coming to spend the Christmas and New Year holidays with their
families.
   No immediate comment was available from Israeli authorities.

   Iraq asked the World Health Organization
on Saturday to help free medicine and equipment to combat
hepatitis, which Iraq claims contributed to the deaths of some
children since U.N. trade sanctions began.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said a national committee against
hepatitis sent a telegram saying the sanctions halted imports of
``the equipment and special tools to discover the hepatitis B virus
and also the vaccine against it.''
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, did not refer to a specific
outbreak or epidemic, but said the sickness ``is considered a big
health problem in Iraq, especially among children.''
   Without providing figures on hepatitis cases, the report said
the committee told officials at the Geneva-based U.N. agency that
2,042 children under 5 years old have died since the embargo began
in August. Iraq blamed the deaths on shortages of baby food and
medicine, and claimed many of those who died suffered from
hepatitis.
   The embargo is meant to retaliate for Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   Hepatitis B is one of five strains of the blood virus that can
be prevented by vaccine. Serious cases of hepatitis can lead to
liver problems.
   ``The committee called in the telegram on the World Health
Organization to interfere immediately to release the food and
medicine seige and release imported medicine, vaccine, equipment
and tools to control the hepititis virus in Iraq,'' the news agency
said.
   Western diplomats in Baghdad say Iraq has received 120 tons of
medicine from humanitarian groups worldwide since mid-October. Most
of the shipments were in exchange for Western hostages trapped by
the Persian Gulf crisis. President Saddam Hussein decided Dec. 6 to
free all foreigners.
   Iraq's Red Crescent, the Islamic equivalent of the Red Cross,
announced recently it had received 22 tons of medical supplies from
Italy and another 28 tons from the U.N. Children's Fund.
   But Irqai officials have said acute shortages exist in some
areas, such as for polio vaccine and drugs to treat heart ailments.

<HEAD>United Nations Halts Aid to Angola After Government Cuts Off
Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations halted deliveries of
humanitarian aid in Angola after its leftist government blocked
food convoys headed to rebel-held areas, a Portuguese report said.
   The cutoff jeopardizes aid for some of the estimated two million
people facing starvation in the southern African nation. A severe
drought this year destroyed many crops.
   ``We suspended all activities in the country because (otherwise)
there would be violation of the principles of neutrality and
equality,'' the Lusa news agency quoted U.N. representative in
Angola, Otto Essian, as saying. Its report was carried late Friday
night.
   The United Nations started aid shipments to Angola seven weeks
ago. It aimed to distribute 130 million tons of food over six
months to hungry Angolans who have suffered during 15 years of
civil war.
   According to Lusa, Angola's minister of planning told Essian
that food deliveries in rebel-controlled territories must stop
immediately.
   The minister justified the decision saying military action by
U.S.-backed UNITA rebels had slowed down food convoys in areas
under government control. He said the rebels had blown up an
important bridge that linked the towns of Lubango and Caconda in
the southern province of Huila.
   UNITA, the National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola,
has been fighting to force the Soviet-backed government to share
control since independence from Portugal in 1975.
   The two sides agreed to open peace corridors to allow
international organizations to deliver food, medicine and clothes
to half of Angola's 18 provinces. But they have continued fighting.
   The civil war has devastated Angola's mineral-rich economy and
killed over 350,000 people, according to government figures.
   After talks in Washington Dec. 13, the warring sides agreed to
set a date for free elections and then sign a cease-fire.
   However, the rebels accused the government Saturday of
undermining the next round of talks scheduled for early next year
by making unreasonable demands, Lusa reported, citing a UNITA
statement monitored in Lisbon.

<HEAD>Inquirer Recants Controversial Editorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Inquirer apologized
publicly Saturday for an editorial that had been attacked as racist
because it linked a new contraceptive to efforts to reverse
poverty.
   The editorial appeared in the newspaper's early Sunday edition,
which went on sale Saturday morning.
   The newspaper took the unusual step in response to criticism of
a Dec. 12 editorial that suggested the contraceptive Norplant,
recently approved by the federal government, could help solve the
problem of poverty among blacks.
   ``The earlier Norplant editorial undercut our credibility and
our efforts to be a thoughtful, responsible and compassionate voice
on the complex issues of poverty,'' the newspaper said in its lead
editorial in Sunday editions. ``We apologize to those we hurt and
offended.''
   The apology noted the newspaper's own reporters, editors and
editorial board members were among those incensed by the original
editorial. It was printed alongside five letters to the editor,
containing both praise and criticism.
   The original editorial discussed two stories in the previous
day's newspaper. One was about Norplant, which prevents pregnancy
through implants of tiny rods under the skin and stays effective
for years, the other about a research finding that nearly half of
black children live in poverty and the situation is growing worse.
   ``As we read those two stories, we asked ourselves: Dare we
mention them in the same breath? To do so might be considered
deplorably insensitive, perhaps raising the specter of eugenics.
But it would be worse to avoid drawing the logical conclusion that
foolproof contraception could be invaluable in breaking the cycle
of inner city poverty - one of America's greatest challenges,'' the
original editorial said.
   The editorial, written by deputy editorial page editor Donald
Kimelman, acknowledged better prenatal care and better schools as
possible solutions to the problem.
   But it also said ``it's very tough to undo the damage of being
born into a dysfunctional family. So why not make a major effort to
reduce the number of children, of any race, born into such
circumstances?''
   The newspaper said reliable birth control should be a matter of
personal choice and should be as available to poor women who want
to use it as to middle-class women.
   ``In linking the issues of race and contraception, we left too
many people with the impression that our cure for poverty was to
reduce the number of black people,'' the apology said. That
conclusion ``certainly was not what we meant to suggest,'' it said.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan and India have agreed to cut
back troops along their tense border, this country's state-run
television announced Saturday.
   No numbers were immediately given for the cutbacks, but the
announcement was one of the first signs of reduced tensions between
the two countries.
   The announcement seemed to catch both military and foreign
ministry spokesmen by surprise. They had no immediate details.
   Indian officials had no immediate comment.
   Relations between the two nations, often at odds in the past,
again nosedived in January when Moslem militants launched a
secessionist uprising in Indian-held Kashmir.
   India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir, in 1948
and 1965.
   The independence uprising has left more than 1,300 people dead.
Thousands more have fled to Pakistan-held Kashmir.
   The former princely state of Kashmir was divided between Islamic
Pakistan and majority Hindu India in 1947 when British rule of the
subcontinent ended.
   India accuses Pakistan of arming militant secessionists, a
charge Pakistan vehemently denies.

   A homeless rights group said Saturday it has
settled a copyright dispute with the creator of a contemporary
``nativity'' scene depicting a family huddled over a streetside
steam grate.
   The Community for Creative Non-Violence, which was founded by
the late Mitch Snyder, said U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson approved an agreement last week giving joint copyright
interests to both CCNV and sculptor James Earl Reid.
   The agreement gives CCNV the right to make two-dimensional
copies such as Christmas cards and posters of the statue entitled
``Third World America.''
   Reid retains the right to make both two- and three-dimensional
copies of the sculpture, the CCNV said.
   The settlement requires the Baltimore sculptor to advise people
who buy his copies that the sales will not benefit CCNV.
   ``We're pleased that this chapter of litigation has finally come
to a conclusion and are happy with the settlement,'' CCNV
spokeswoman Carol Fennelly said in a prepared statement.
   Reid said he is pleased with the settlement, but remains
concerned because he wants access to his original sculpture in the
CCNV shelter.
   Another case is pending in which Reid is trying to remove that
sculpture from the shelter for several months while a master mold
is made.
   The master mold would allow Reid to reproduce the work and
protect it. Reid said that the sculpture in the CCNV shelter is a
synthetic cement-like substance that is brittle. Reid wants to
reproduce it in bronze.
   ``Being against my having access to my work is contrary to the
spirit of public art,'' said Reid. ``The work is for the public
good. It's not just to lay in their shelter.''
   The statue, unveiled on the Ellipse near the Washington Monument
on Christmas Eve 1985, was commissioned by CCNV, which was headed
by Snyder, a nationally known advocate for the homeless who earlier
this year committed suicide.
   Reid donated his time to complete the statue but the group paid
him $15,000 for expenses incurred in creating it. As a result, CCNV
owned the statue itself and that was never questioned.
   However, Reid registered the copyright for the statue under his
name after CCNV planned a multi-city tour to raise money for the
homeless.
   CCNV then filed suit claiming exclusive copyright ownership.
   In March 1989, the Supreme Court ruled that CCNV didn't own the
copyright and returned the case to Jackson.

   The cold wave broke more low temperature records in the West on
Saturday, and thunderstorms developing ahead of the cold front in
the South spawned at least one tornado.
   Temperatures plunged below zero late Friday and early Saturday
from the Great Basin through the northern and central Rockies to
the upper Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures of 20 degrees below zero or colder were reported in
Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, South
Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota.
   Wyoming was again the coldest state with lows ranging from 27
below at Sheridan to 45 degrees below zero at Worland, the coldest
spot in the nation Saturday morning.
   Seven cities in the West tied or surpassed previous all-time
record lows. Winnemucca, Nev., reported an all-time record low of
37 below zero.
   About 40 cities in the West, including more than a dozen in
California and 14 in Utah, reported record lows for the date. The
low of 25 below zero at Denver tied the city's record for the whole
month of December.
   Temperatures were still below zero at midday across the northern
and central Plains and the upper half of the Mississippi Valley.
Readings were still 20 below zero or colder in North Dakota,
Montana and Wyoming. Worland, Wyo., was still 27 degrees below zero
at midday.
   Behind the cold front marking the leading edge of the cold air,
snow, sleet and freezing rain prevailed from southern Indiana to
south-central Texas.
   Strong thunderstorms developing along and ahead of the cold
front extended from southern Louisiana to northern Alabama during
the afternoon.
   Thunderstorms over central Mississippi spawned a tornado which
damaged a house and took the roof off a building at Pinola, the
National Weather Service said.
   The thunderstorms also produced high wind which unroofed a house
near Brookhaven, downed trees near Mendenhall, and downed a tractor
shed and numerous trees near Philadelphia.
   Showers extended across western and middle Tennessee into the
upper Ohio Valley. Clouds and drizzle and fog prevailed across much
of the rest of the East.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST
included 2.21 inches at Huntsville, Ala., 1.58 inches at Columbus,
Miss., 1.30 inches at Jackson, Miss., and 1.24 inches at
Crossville, Tenn.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the 24 hours up to 7 a.m. EST
included 4.63 inches at Huntsville, Ala., 4.13 inches at Muscle
Shoals, Ala., and 3.52 inches at Dyersburg, Tenn.
   Unseasonably warm weather continued in the East. Temperatures
remained above 50 degrees last night as far north as the lower
Great Lakes, southern New York and southern New England.
   Record highs were 53 at Albany, N.Y.; 52 at Binghamton, N.Y.; 62
at Boston; 54 at Bridgeport, Conn.; 67 at Elkins, W.Va.; 58 at
Hartfort, Conn.; and 61 at Providence, R.I.
   Overnight lows across the state of Texas ranged from 67 at
Brownsville to 6 below zero at Dalhart.
   Brisk winds and subzero temperatures in the north central United
States continued to produced wind chill readings as cold as 60
degrees below zero at Duluth, Minn., Livingston, Mont., and Casper,
Wyo.
   An upper level weather disturbance brought clouds and snow to
parts of Washington and Oregon, while low pressure continued to
bring snow to parts of New Mexico and Arizona.

<TEXT>
   Miami Herald Executive Editor Janet Chusmir, a
pioneering journalist who guided the newspaper to two Pulitzer
Prizes, died Saturday of a brain aneurism at age 60.
   She collapsed Friday night at her home in Miami Beach and was
rushed to St. Francis Hospital in a coma. She died Saturday morning
without regaining consciousness, the Herald said.
   The collapse came only about an hour after she left the Herald's
evening news meeting and stopped at desks to extend holiday wishes
to reporters and editors.
   ``We have lost a great friend and a great editor,'' said Herald
Publisher David Lawrence. ``What zest she had for good newspapers,
what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right
and fair for everyone. She set a wonderful example.''
   Born in Boston, she graduated from Boston University in 1949
with a journalism degree.
   After graduation, she married Leonard Chusmir, the college
paper's editor, and raised a family. Then in 1963, the family moved
to Miami Beach, and she began working for $2.50 a story with the
now-defunct Miami Beach Daily Sun.
   She was hired by the Herald in 1968 and soon had a regular
column and a collection of awards for feature writing. By 1977 she
worked her way up to assistant managing editor for features.
   In 1982 the Herald's parent company, Knight-Ridder Newspapers,
named her publisher and president of the Boulder, Colo., Daily
Camera, making her the organization's first female chief executive.
   ``Janet left an imprint on everything she touched,'' said John
L. Dotson Jr., publisher of the Daily Camera. ``The Camera today is
one legacy of her creativity and energy. Many of the innovations
she instituted continue to be featured and many of the staffers are
here today because of her.''
   Chusmir returned to the Herald in 1987 as executive editor, the
senior newsroom position. In 1988, the paper won two Pulitzers, one
for commentary to Dave Barry for his humor columns, and one for
feature photography to Michel DuCille for a photo essay on a Miami
crack neighborhood.
   In a ``View From the Newsroom'' column last year, she wrote that
the newspaper business is ``a sacred trust. We are our readers'
eyes and ears; we must be fair, accurate, sensitive and courageous.
Courageous because we help to set the agenda and sometimes that is
painful for all of us who live in this community.''
   Last month, the National Press Foundation unanimously selected
her as Editor of the Year for ``transforming the Herald to serve
the unique multicultural population of greater Miami.''
   She is survived by her husband, Leonard; son Steven; daughter
Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro; and grandchild Matthew Shapiro.

<TEXT>
   Investigators searched Saturday for clues
as to why a chartered ferry capsized in choppy seas, killing at
least 19 American sailors who were in the Middle East as part of
Operation Desert Shield.
   Survivors said the Israeli ferry went under almost instantly
after it was swamped early Saturday while ferrying about 100
crewmen back to the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga from shore leave
in Haifa.
   ``All of a sudden I saw water just come flying in. It was maybe
two seconds and the boat rolled right over,'' said Chief Petty
Officer Lance Vickery, 33, of Jacksonville, Fla.
   Israeli divers retrieved six bodies from the sunken craft in 65
feet of water. The others were found dead on the surface or died of
injuries after being rescued alive, officials said. Three dozen
sailors were taken to hospitals, but most were released.
   By Saturday afternoon, two men were still reported unaccounted
for, but Navy officials said they believed they would be located as
crewmen reported back to their ships.
   The Saratoga and its three escort ships were in the Red Sea as
part of the naval buildup in the Persian Gulf region in the wake of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The accident was the deadliest involving U.S servicemen in
Operation Desert Shield, and it raised the number of Americans who
have died to at least 73.
   Haifa is a frequent port of call for American sailors. Last
year, more than 45,000 sailors attached to the Sixth Fleet visited
the northern port city.
   Several sailors rescued from the Tuvia said the craft may have
been overloaded. One of the two Israeli crewmen, Yossi Shochat,
said he believed too many sailors were crowded into the boat's
stern.
   But Gen. Micha Ram, the commander of Israel's navy, said on
Israel radio that the Tuvia had been licensed to carry 130
passengers but took only about 100 because the seas were running
high.
   ``Until the boat is retrieved and can be examined ... we cannot
point to any negligence,'' he said.
   He said the craft went down in 15 or 20 seconds and added: ``I
have never known a vessel to sink so fast.''
   Survivors told of harrowing moments in the water, clinging to
life jackets and debris from the 57-foot-long, double-deck ferry.
At least some of the injured were struck by a rescue boat.
   Six of the injured remained in Haifa's Rambam Hospital on
Saturday night. Matty Ilnach, head duty nurse at Rambam, said all
were listed as slightly wounded, and could be released Sunday.
   Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a U.S. Navy spokesman, said 36 sailors were
admitted to Haifa hospitals but that most were released immediately
after a checkup.
   Col. Ranaan Gissen, the Israeli army's deputy spokesman, said
more than 30 others were plucked from the waters unharmed in a
rescue operation by both U.S. and Israeli forces.
   Flares lit the sky over the harbor of the northern city for much
of the night, and ambulances rushed victims to three Haifa-area
hospitals.
   Some sailors rescued from the capsized ferry said they had spent
their shore leave having dinner, drinking beer or visiting
discotheques.
   Israel army radio reported that some of the sailors had been
drunk and at least one of the dead victims was handcuffed,
apparently after being arrested by U.S. military police for
drunkenness.
   However, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Commander Alan Dooley said no
one aboard the boat was in handcuffs.
   The Tuvia capsized shortly after midnight about 200 yards from
the Saratoga, which was anchored outside the harbor's breakwater
about a mile offshore. The waves were reported at three to four
feet and winds at 35 mph when the craft heeled over.
   Quigley said, ``I would point out that the operation of the boat
was completely separate (from Navy operations.) There was an
Israeli master and crewman. ... The sailors were passengers.''
   Quigley said all 1,920 sailors who began liberty Friday were
ordered to return to the carrier and three escort ships to try to
account for all sailors.
   The Saratoga task force, based at Mayport Naval Air Station in
Jacksonville, Fla., includes the destroyer Sampson, cruiser South
Carolina and combat stores ship Sirius. It has 6,200 men, including
about 4,500 aboard the Saratoga.
   The Saratoga naval task force arrived in Haifa on Thursday night
from the Red Sea.
   Quigley said bodies of the victims would probably be flown back
to the United States starting Sunday.
   Gissen said police and port officials were conducting two
separate investigations into the cause of the sinking. The Navy
also ordered a probe of the accident.
   Seaman Michael Benjamin, 19, of San Antonio, Texas, said he was
standing in the ferry's aft when he saw water pouring in as the
craft bounced over the waves.
   ``We were going on the waves, and I just noticed one that was
bigger than normal and then we noticed another one that was bigger
than normal. The next thing I know, all I saw coming in was water.
I was tilted forward, I heard a lot of yelling, `She's going
down.'''
   Benjamin suffered a neck injury when he was hit in the water by
one of the rescue boats.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday
outlawed attempts by two Moldavian ethnic groups to form new
republics. Two bombings were reported in other troubled areas.
   Ethnic tension and struggles against the Kremlin have dominated
recent events in the 15 Soviet republics, which have all declared
some form of independence or autonomy.
   Gorbachev gave Moldavia 10 days to dissolve a new national guard
and guarantee equal rights for all ethnic groups. Four people were
killed in the southern republic last month when government troops
clashed with activists seeking independence from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev also asked Moldavia to reconsider a law making
Moldavian the republic's official language.
   Language is among issues cited by the two ethnic groups seeking
their own republics.
   The Gagauz, comprising about 150,000 Turkish Christians,
declared a new republic in southern Moldavia. In eastern Moldavia,
more than 300,000 ethnic Russians and Ukrainians have joined to
declare a new republic along the Dneister River.
   They all resent the Moldavian-language law and requirements that
people in dozens of jobs pass Moldavian language tests by 1995.
Moldavian, spoken by about two-thirds of the republic's people, is
identical to Romanian except for the Cyrillic script.
   Gorbachev said the declaration of the new republics was illegal
under the Soviet and Moldavian constitutions.
   The Moldavian legislature has clamped a two-month state of
emergency on the Gagauz region, restricting movement in and out of
the area and banning public rallies.
   In Latvia, a bomb exploded in a military school in the capital
of Riga late Saturday, breaking 200 windows and causing $80,000
damage, the official news agency Tass reported. No injuries were
reported.
   Three explosions struck the Baltic republic's capital earlier in
the week, smashing windows in the Latvian Communist Party building,
the Soviet army prosecutor's office and the Latvian prime
minister's office.
   No suspects or motives have been identified in any of the
blasts.
   However, Latvia has been seeking independence from the Soviet
Union.
   In the southern Nagorno-Karabakh region, a powerful explosion
left a 12-foot-wide crater in the road, narrowly missing a bus
carrying Interior Ministry troops, Tass said.
   One officer was wounded by fragments of broken glass and the bus
was seriously damaged, it said.
   In the past two years, more than 200 people have died in ethnic
clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian enclave inside the
border of the neighboring Azerbaijan republic. A limited form of
martial law has been imposed and is enforced by Interior Ministry
troops.

   Police following up a tip arrested a man
early Saturday in connection with a series of nighttime house
shootings that frightened a section of the city.
   No one was injured in the shootings, although there were some
near misses as shotgun blasts shattered windows and penetrated
walls. Some residents began sleeping and watching television on the
floor and took down Christmas lights as police cautioned them to
keep houses as dark as possible.
   Gary LeClerc, 27, who lived in the area of the shootings, was
arrested at his apartment without incident and charged with felony
criminal mischief, felonious use of a firearm and harassment. Bail
was set at $51,000.
   Deputy Police Chief Paul Brodeur said other charges will be
filed.
   Police said no motive had been determined in the apparently
random shootings.
   LeClerc was arrested after he allegedly made three harassing
telephone calls on Wednesday to Manchester police, officers said.
   During two calls, a man threatened to kill Police Chief Thomas
King, police told a Saturday news conference. In a third call, the
man threatened the life of Deputy Chief Louis Craig, who will
replace the retiring King next month.
   Ten homes were hit in 11 shootings - King's house was hit twice
- since the first in adjacent Litchfield on Oct. 7. There was one
more shooting in Litchfield and the rest were in the south end of
Manchester, all since Nov. 25.
   LeClerc, a former Auburn humane officer, was turned down for a
job with the Manchester Police Department within the last two
years, officers said. He is separated from his wife and lives
alone.
   A $2,000 reward was offered for help in an arrest and
conviction. Brodeur said police received a telephone tip that
LeClerc might be the sniper, and began investigating.

<TEXT>
   Turkey is sending 12,500 more soldiers to
its border with Iraq in a continuing buildup as the U.N. deadline
approaches for Iraq to leave Kuwait, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet also quoted unidentified military
sources as saying Iraq has increased its forces in the area.
   A total of 8,000 more Turkish paratroopers were sent to the
border area in the past 10 days, the paper said. It said 4,500
infantry soldiers will be transferred there from Thrace in
northwestern Turkey.
   Not counting the latest reported deployment, Turkey has about
100,000 troops along the border with Iraq. Most were sent there
shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   No officials were available to confirm the Cumhuriyet report.
   Premier Yildirim Akbulut said Thursday that the government had
asked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to send air units to
Iraq to bolster the country's defense.
   Turkish newspapers criticized the request Saturday, arguing it
would commit Turkey militarily in the event of a Persian Gulf war.
The newspapers said Iraq would see the NATO units as a provocation,
not as an increased defense measure.
   NATO confirmed Friday it was considering the request to have the
squadrons in place by Jan. 15, the U.N. deadline. Belgium said it
was preparing a squadron of Mirage jetfighters.
   The U.N. Security Council has passed a resolution authorizing
the use of force if Iraq does not pull out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   A Turkish parliamentary delegation arrived in Baghdad on
Saturday on a peace mission.
   The head of the delegation, opposition leader Erdal Inonu, told
the official Iraqi News Agency upon arrival that the delegation
sought ``means of achieving peace and averting war over the gulf
crisis.''
   The group planned meetings with senior officials, including
President Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi news agency said.

   The exiled emir of Kuwait and five Arab
allies opened a summit Saturday seeking a common strategy to free
Kuwait and strengthen their forces to guard against further Iraqi
aggression.
   ``This is the summit of liberation and transformation,'' said
Abdullah Bishara, secretary-general of the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council.
   The emir of Qatar, Sheik Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, in opening
remarks denounced Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He said he hoped Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein ``would listen to reason and spare the
region he perils of war.''
   ``Iraq upset all balances and disturbed the rules of Arab bonds
as well as the essence of gulf security,'' he said.
   Besides Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah of Kuwait, others at the
opening of the annual summit were: King Fahd of Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan,
Sultan Qaboos of Oman, and Prime Minister Sheik Khalifa bin Salman
Al Khalifa of Bahrain.
   Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheik Nawaf al-Sabah predicted the
summit would discuss the possibility of asking the United States
and some Arab nations to station troops in Kuwait if Iraq withdraws
or is forced out.
   Summit sources also said leaders are expected to study plans for
transforming the council's 10,000-member rapid deployment force
into a full-fledged ``joint gulf army.''
   ``The aggression that we face and the threat to peace and
security of our member states will be added incentive for ... our
determination to move with firm steps toward the future capable of
confronting all circumstances and dealing with them from a position
of strength,'' Fahd said.
   Shortly before the summit got under way, a Kuwaiti official
urged a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis ``to spare bloodshed
and avert destruction.''
   In a statement released in Taif, Saudi Arabia, the minister of
state for foreign affairs, Sheik Nasser Mohammed al-Ahmed, said he
was responding to ``statements by some Arab officials'' about
Saddam being ready for face-saving concessions.
   The statement, however, reiterated that no settlement would be
acceptable unless it involved unconditional, total Iraqi withdrawal
and restoration of the al-Sabah rule. He also stressed the need for
Iraqi reparations for the destruction by Iraqi forces in Kuwait.
   The council was created in the summer of 1981 as a framework for
collective defense and economic integration.
   The summit was scheduled to resume Sunday and last through
Monday.

   The Christmas tree in the lobby of the city
Board of Pensions and Retirement had just one gift-wrapped box
under it last week.
   It had an opening like a coin slot in the top and it was empty.
   Retired and current employees fear that's what their pension
fund will look like if the fund loans money to aid the cash-starved
city.
   The administration of Mayor W. Wilson Goode has tried since
August to borrow enough money to meet expenses through winter.
Payless paydays for city workers are likely next month without a
cash infusion.
   A $375 million offering of short-term notes failed in September.
The city is negotiating with banks, the city pension board and the
state Public School Employees' Retirement Board over the terms of a
$150 million note issue.
   The decision on the note issue was put off last week until after
Christmas or possibly the New Year.
   The money would allow the city to pay its workers and meet
debt-service payment, but not to pay suppliers already owed
millions of dollars. Goode said Friday night, ``$150 million is
better than zero.''
   Potential investors and city officials reported progress on loan
terms after five hours of closed-door negotiations Friday. Banks
have demanded an array of guarantees aimed at ensuring repayment to
investors and a cure to city deficits projected to exceed $500
million over the next 18 months.
   A bank proposal for an outside authority with line-item veto
power over the city budget was scuttled, Goode said.
   But a financial control element remains in the package, City
Controller Jonathan A. Saidel said. Its makeup would be determined
by the state Legislature, he said, declining to give further
details.
   Goode, Saidel and other Democratic leaders in a fiscal recovery
plan announced Nov. 9 suggested an independent control board be
created. The board'w authority would be triggered if the city
passed an unrealistically balanced budget.
   In the loan package being negotiated, each of the two pension
boards would buy up to 25 percent of the total amount, or $37.5
million of a $150 million deal. The other $75 million would be
purchased by the banks.
   The notes are expected to pay about 10.5 percent tax-exempt
interest, nearly twice the going rate on notes offered by
governments with solid credit ratings. Philadelphia's rating has
sunk this year to junk-bond level, the lowest among major U.S.
cities.
   The city pension board's investment is far from certain. No vote
will be taken until a consultant advises board members on the
prudence of such an investment. The consultant's report is not
expected until negotiations produce a final loan package, possibly
late this week.
   The consultant's report will be weighed against the sentiments
of those who depend on the pension fund for retirement income.
   ``My members, both active and pension, don't want us to do it,
period,'' said John A. Reilly, a firefighters' union representative
on the board.
   But Joseph Herkness, a white-collar union leader on the board,
said it may be necessary to find a way that's palatable to pension
fund members. If payrolls are missed, so are payments to the
pension plan, he said.
   ``We will consider all options when we're talking about a public
bankruptcy, especially when our contributions to this fund are in
danger,'' Herkness said.
   The state teachers pension board recessed a Dec. 14 meeting so
it could reconvene on short notice to consider an investment.

<TEXT>
   A group of federal prison inmates has donated
$525.50 to help the less fortunate - the city's homeless.
   The Los Angeles Mission accepted the check, representing money
earned by 58 Terminal Island inmates at the rate of 12 to 40 cents
per hour.
   ``The mission is touched,'' mission spokesman Michael McKee said
Friday. ``A lot of the problems that drive the men into prison,
drive them to the streets. The inmates had tremendous empathy for
these people on the streets.''
   Helping the homeless was the idea of inmate John Barton Bastian,
who wrote to the mission, said Harvey Trott, the prison warden's
executive assistant.
   ``It puts them (the inmates) in a Christmas spirit because it
gives them an opportunity to help people who are more disadvantaged
than themselves,'' Trott said.
   The medium-security Terminal Island prison is in the harbor
area, 20 miles south of downtown. It houses 1,085 inmates.

   For one pair of brothers-in-law, it
isn't really Christmas until one sends the other ``Ivan'' - the
same greeting card they have exchanged every Yule season for 42
years.
   The tradition began in 1948, when Irving Willis mailed the
unsigned card to his wife's brother, Delbert Gibson.
   Although the two men were living in the same house in
Washington, D.C., ``I knew who it was that sent it right away,''
said Gibson, now 83. ``It was his kind of humor.
   ``So I kept the card, and the next year, sent it back to him
with a Russian Christmas greeting,'' said Gibson, a professional
linguist who now lives in Fort Lauderdale.
   ``Because the guy on the cover is riding a Russian sled, I
picked Russian and we named the card Ivan. Then he sent it back to
me the following year and it soon became a tradition.''
   Every year since, the greeting has been written in a different
language, except for two years the men unwittingly wrote in
dialects of two languages that already had been used.
   When Gibson received the card this year, he found the greeting
``Krismasi Njema'' - ``Merry Christmas'' in Luo, an African
language.
   ``I live in a retirement home, and one of the men that works
here is from Kenya,'' said Willis, 79, a retired Navy captain now
making his home in Washington.
   Now, the men are beginning to run out of languages for their
annual holiday greeting. The two used up more common languages such
as French, Dutch and Italian the first few years.
   The card also is running out of blank space for future
greetings.
   ``We would have to write on the front,'' said Gibson, ``and I
don't think we want to do that.''

<HEAD>Cambodian Factions Agree on Key Points in Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE GANLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's four warring factions said Sunday they
have agreed on most key elements of a U.N. peace plan, but they
ended their round of talks without a final accord.
   The outcome of the two-day Paris talks fell short of the
objective set by France and Indonesia, co-chairmen of the
conference, to secure total agreement to the proposal. However, the
participants said the Paris Peace Conference would reconvene ``at
an early date.''
   A final communique by the Supreme National Council, made up of
the warring groups, said early Sunday there was agreement on ``most
of the fundamental points'' of the U.N.-sponsored plan. But it
added there were outstanding questions.
   These questions should be discussed within the 12-member council
and by the Coordinating Committee of the Paris Conference, which is
the framework for signing an overall peace settlement to end more
than a decade of civil war in the Southeast Asian country.
   The U.N. plan was agreed to Nov. 26 by the United States and the
four other permanent members of the Security Council. It calls for
the United Nations to administer Cambodia during an interim period
leading to free elections, while the Supreme National Council acts
as titular head. It also calls for a cease-fire and disarming of
all four parties.
   The heads of all the resistance factions voiced their acceptance
``without reserve'' of the plan and called on the Phnom Penh
government to accept it. The resistance representatives were Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, heading the delegation of rebel coalition leader
Prince Norodom; Son Sann; and Khieu Samphan, leader of the
Communist Khmer Rouge.
   The government of Prime Minister Hun Sen was the only one of the
four Cambodian factions to object to key aspects of the U.N.
proposal, according to informed sources speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   A senior Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Phnom Penh is concerned about the extent to which its
government could be dismantled by the plan and about the extent of
disarmament.
   Hun Sen said on his arrival here that ``serious measures must be
taken to suppress the foundations'' of the Khmer Rouge, the
strongest member of the three-party resistance coalition.
   The Khmer Rouge's three-year reign as Cambodia's government,
which ended in 1979 with a Vietnamese invasion, left hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians dead from executions, famine and civil
unrest.

<HEAD>Official: German Firms May Have Tried to Skirt Iraq Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government official said Saturday that
evidence indicates some German firms planned to ship goods to Iraq
in violation of a U.N. trade embargo.
   Volker Franzen, spokesman for the Economics Ministry, said the
evidence suggests ``a few'' firms were involved, but no proof has
been found that German goods illegally landed in Iraq. He did not
name the companies or give other details.
   The United Nations placed the embargo on Iraq following the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Franzen said German officials have been studying a list compiled
by U.S. officials of 50 German firms suspected of breaking the
embargo.
   Der Spiegel magazine has reported two German companies may have
helped Iraq in the production of nerve gas. The magazine also
alleged Interatom gave Iraq sensitive nuclear training and
equipment.
   Interatom and its owner, the giant electronics conglomerate
Siemens, denied the magazine's report. Interatom specializes in
atomic energy plant construction and uranium enrichment, but is
also involved in non-nuclear engineering.
   Franzen said the information from the U.S. list is of ``varying
quality,'' and some firms are included which are completely above
suspicion. But he said in other cases further investigation is
needed.
   If German firms are found to have violated the embargo, they
could face charges in Germany of breaking the country's export
laws.
   Der Spiegel magazine said the list of alleged German
embargo-busters resulted from U.S. monitoring of Iraqi telephone
and Telefax communications.
   ``U.S. officials are informed of Iraq's supply plans because
American intelligence listens in on Iraq's overall telephone
traffic and intercepts Telefax messages,'' the magazine said,
without identifying its sources.
   In another export scandal in 1988, U.S. intelligence said German
companies helped Libya build a factory allegedly for making
chemical weapons. The German government at first rejected the
allegations, but later acknowledged they were true.
   As a result of that scandal, the head of a German chemical firm
was convicted of breaking the country's export laws.

<HEAD>Oil Companies Get Approval for Limited Imports from Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. oil companies have been authorized to
import limited amounts of oil from Iran and send their payments to
an escrow fund established to pay claims won against the Iranian
government by Americans.
   The imports, to be handled on a case-by-case basis, were
authorized by President Bush in early November, according to State
Department officials. They are covered by 1987 Treasury regulations
setting up a mechanism for commercial deals with Iran.
   The payments go into an escrow account overseen by the Iran-U.S.
Claims Tribunal, an organization set up in The Hague in 1981 to
arbitrate commercial disputes between U.S. claimants and the
Iranian government.
   ``Last month we decided to license the import of Iranian oil
into the United States on a case-by-case basis where the proceeds
of the transaction are to be deposited in the security account,''
State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty confirmed Saturday
night.
   ``If such transactions occur, this will help ensure that there
are adequate funds available to pay tribunal awards to U.S.
claimants. To date, over $2 billion has been transferred from the
security account in satisfaction of tribunal awards to U.S.
claimants.''
   Addition of oil to items that can be imported from Iran on a
case-by-case basis was reported initially by Platt's Week, an oil
industry newsletter, and subsequently by The New York Times.
   State Department officials said the main reason for allowing oil
imports was to help keep the escrow account funded. But they
acknowledged that the move creates an additional oil supply in the
event that a war in the Middle East results in a shortage.

<TEXT>
   A university in the port city of
Chittagong was closed indefinitely Saturday after a clash between
rival student groups, police said. More than 130 people were
reportedly injured.
   The clashes broke out when the university reopened after a
recess and supporters of the Islamic Students' Organization
attacked students attending classes, said Anupan Sen, a former
president of the university teachers association. The Islamic
students had called for an indefinite strike at the school.
   The group has demanded the removal of the university's vice
chancellor. It members say he has not been sympathetic to them in
university affairs.
   More than 100 students and at least 30 teachers were injured in
the two-hour confrontation between the Islamic Students'
Organization and the All Party Students Action Committee, said Sen.
   Bricks and homemade bombs were used in the clash, police and
witnesses said. The Islamic group claimed three members were
wounded by bullets.
   The organization is the students' wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a
pro-Pakistan fundamentalist group opposed to the liberation of
Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971.
   A large contingent of police was deployed inside the Chittagong
University, about 135 miles southeast of Dhaka.

<HEAD>Stanford Agrees To Temporary Cut in Rate It Charges Government For
Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanford University, under fire for
claiming faculty discounts on game tickets are research-related
expenses, has agreed to temporarily cut its billing rate to the
government by 2 percent.
   The decrease is part of a ``provisional agreement'' drafted
during talks last week between Stanford administrators and a team
of contract experts and administrators from the Office of Naval
Research - one of three federal agencies investigating Stanford's
billing of research overhead costs.
   The Navy is looking into claims that the school may have
overbilled the government as much as $200 million in the past
decade.
   The interim agreement ``permits business relationships to be put
on an orderly basis'' while the investigations continue, said
Stanford spokesman Larry Horton.
   Stanford was charging the government 74 percent above the cost
of a research contract to pay for overhead costs.
   Overhead costs include electricity bills, building depreciation,
administrative expenses and the use of campus libraries and other
facilities by researchers under government contract. The government
allows those expenses.
   But Stanford also contends that fringe benefits for its faculty,
such as discounts on football and basketball tickets, swimming
pools, tennis courts and gyms, are ordinary costs of doing business
and includes them in research overhead charges.
   Under the temporary contract, the university will be reimbursed
at 72 percent until June 1991, when the Navy investigation is
expected to be completed.
   Based on what the probes find, the billing rate may change.
   In exchange for Stanford's temporary billing rate pullback, the
head of the five-member Navy team approved payment of $3.8 million
in research bills that the Office of Naval Research had refused to
release since October.
   Stanford also agreed to reopen talks on ``memorandums of
understanding'' that have guided its billing practices for
government research during the past 30 years. Some government
officials say the rates set in the documents may have unduly
benefited Stanford at the expense of taxpayers.

<HEAD>Security Council Ends Trusteeship of Pacific Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council voted Saturday to
dissolve a 43-year-old U.N. trusteeship over several Pacific island
chains that were once a stage for Cold War rivalries.
   The end of U.N. authority over the Northern Marianas, Marshall
Islands and Federated States of Micronesia in the Western Pacific
leaves Palau as the only remaining part of the Trust Territory.
Palau continues under U.S. administration.
   The vote followed U.S. assurances it would not expand military
bases or presence in the region, which had once been considered
crucial for the ``Star Wars'' missile defense program.
   Cuba, one of the 15 Security Council members, cast the only vote
in opposition to ending the trusteeship. Cuban diplomats cited
objections by some island residents who complained about U.S.
administration and alleged military objectives in the region.
   The Soviet Union had for years criticized the United States as
the islands administering authority, claiming it bullied the island
residents and sought to establish a military-strategic beachhead in
the Pacific.
   But dramatically improved U.S.-Soviet relations appear to have
resolved the differences.
   Former President Reagan had said the U.S. army's Kwajalein
missile testing range in the Marshall Islands was ``vital to our
Strategic Defense Initiative,'' also known as ``Star Wars.''
   However, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the U.S.
government had no intention of expanding the size or number of
military installations on the islands.
   The Marshall Islands and the Federated States had argued that
elimination of the U.N. trusteeship would make it easier for them
to establish diplomatic and economic relations with other states,
especially Britain and European nations.
   But the Northern Mariana Islands governor wrote the Security
Council asking that the islands remain under the trusteeship.
   The Northern Marianas are a U.S. commonwealth. The Marshalls and
Federated States of Micronesia are semi-independent republics.
   The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was established in
1947, one of 11 trusteeships established by the United Nations.
   The region includes about 200,000 people scattered among more
than 2,100 islands and atolls. It covers nearly 3 million square
miles of the Pacific Ocean, slightly larger than the continental
United States. The islands represent a land area only half the size
of Rhode Island.

   The record cold wave pressed southward and eastward Saturday,
threatening crops in southern Texas and California and covering
highways with deadly sheets of ice across the Plains and Midwest.
   Temperatures fell to more than 40 degrees below zero in places,
the National Weather Service said.
   Utilities fought to restore electricity and gas service to
thousands of shivering customers.
   In sharp contrast to the cold and snow, the East still had mild
weather. Boston hit a record 62 during the morning. Heavy rain and
flooding forced the evacuations of more than 90 people across
Tennessee on Saturday, state emergency officials said.
   Tornadoes swirled around Mississippi for the third straight day
Saturday as crews tried to assess damage and start cleanup from
Friday's twisters, which killed two people and injured many more.
   Gov. Ray Mabus on Saturday declared a state of emergency for all
of Mississippi, allowing those affected by the tornadoes to seek
state government aid.
   Including the Mississippi fatalities, at least 24 deaths had
been blamed on the weather since Tuesday. Most of the fatalities
were the result of traffic accidents on slippery roads. But an
80-year-old woman apparenlty froze to death in her yard in
Childress, Texas, where she had accidentally fallen.
   Heavy snowfall inundated Kansas City, Mo., and sleet was
reported in the St. Louis area.
   Denver hit a record low Saturday of 25 below zero; the city had
been below zero since Wednesday evening. In northern Nevada,
Winnemucca dropped to 37 below, the coldest ever registered there
in more than 100 years of records. Los Angeles hit a record 33. The
Idaho mountain town of Stanley hit a low of 46 below zero.
   The coldest spot in Utah was Randolph, with a low of 40 below.
In South Dakota, there were unofficial overnight lows of 45 below
at Deerfield in the Black Hills and at Porcupine on the Pine Ridge
Indian Reservation. Cheyenne, Wyo., tied its record low of 28
below, then by noon warmed to 2 below, warmest point in the state.
   In southern Arizona, the desert city of Tucson had snow
flurries.
   The arctic air hit the Chicago area during the night, sending
temperatures tumbling from the mild 40s Friday evening to the teens
Saturday morning, and highways throughout the state were icy.
   An Amtrak passenger train carrying 300 people was stuck in
Devils Lake, N.D., for three hours Saturday morning when the fuel
in the engines froze, a Burlington-Northern Railroad spokesman
said.
   Welders were called in to help thaw out the engines. The
temperature was 20 below and the wind chill factor was 50 below.
   Charities dealt with standing-room-only crowds in homeless
shelters and with calls from families freezing in their own homes.
   ``We're way over capacity here,'' said Ruth Wynne at Oklahoma
City's Jesus House.
   ``We are expecting a full house. If we have to we can line the
halls with cots,'' said a Salvation Army official in Longview,
Texas.
   Utilities in northwest Washington and the Puget Sound area
reported repairs were still being made Saturday to power lines
damaged during Tuesday's snow and wind storm.
   Puget Sound Power &amp; Light spokeswoman Betty Werblun said 2,000
customers would not have service restored until Sunday night.
   Utility crews also worked to restore natural gas service to
thousands of homes in frigid southern Oregon.
   ``I tried to buy an electric heater and started calling all over
town and they said they were sold out hours ago,'' said Trudy Bache
of Grants Pass.
   The cold also contributed to utility breakdowns in the San
Francisco area and in the Texas Panhandle.
   Bitter cold was reported in southern Texas, with up to a
half-inch of ice on Kerrville streets. In the Rio Grande Valley,
citrus growers still reeling from a late winter freeze a year ago
were braced for another damaging frost.
   In California, the heavily farmed San Joaquin Valley had record
lows ranging from 19 at Fresno to the teens in the Bakersfield
area, the weather service said.
   ``It's as bad as it's been in probably 20 years,'' said Cliff
Holland of California Citrus Mutual association after checking
growers in the San Joaquin Valley. ``Growers are still optimistic,
but there is fruit loss. The temperatures were low enough to cause
damage.''
   The Amtrak passengers in North Dakota weren't the only travelers
delayed by the weather.
   AAA Auto Club in Denver reported its response time for dead
batteries and other problems had lengthened to about 48 hours
Saturday.
   Thick fog delayed flights at Chicago and Atlanta.

   French filmmaker Roger Vadim, Brigitte Bardot's
ex-husband who launched her career in ``And God Created Woman,''
has married for the fourth time - this time, to yet another famous
actress, Marie-Christine Barrault.
   Vadim, 62, once known as the talented playboy who took beautiful
women and turned them into stars, was also married previously to
Jane Fonda and Annette Stroyberg.
   He is the father of Miss Fonda's daughter, Vanessa, and actress
Catherine Deneuve's son, Christian. He and Miss Barrault, 42,
exchanged vows Friday.
   Miss Barrault earned international fame for her role in the 1975
film ``Cousin, Cousine,'' in which she flees a stuffy, bourgeois
family wedding to pursue a love affair with a relative.
   Vadim and Miss Barrault met while serving on the jury at the
Cognac Film Festival two years ago. They were married in a private
ceremony outside Paris.
   ``Marie-Christine represents the exact, delicious synthesis of
everything I've been looking for until now,'' Vadim told the
magazine Le Figaro.

   Troops warned of a coup plot seized a
jeep carrying weapons and dynamite at an air base and arrested a
fugitive rebel officer, the military said Saturday.
   Former army Capt. Reynaldo Ordonez had been sought since a
failed coup in August 1987. Three others were arrested.
   Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon said an informant told the military the
sabotage team would try to destroy fighter jets, fuel storage tanks
and other equipment at the Basa air base, about 40 miles north of
Manila.
   ``Further information states that the bombing operations in Basa
would serve as the signal for the next coup attempt,'' said Biazon.
   Weapons and nine bundles of dynamite were found on a jeep that
entered the air base Friday.
   Biazon, who was nominated Friday to become chief of staff, said
at least two other vehicles with rebels soldiers failed to enter
the base and escaped. Military rebels have staged at least seven
uprisings against President Corazon Aquino since she took office in
February 1986.
   Officials said they secretly moved most of the jets at the base
to Palawan island after the warning of a sabotage plot. They said
special counter-intelligence teams were deployed around the base.
   Only 12 aging planes were left at the base, said camp commander
Col. Santiago Pitpitan. Most of the country's jet fighters had been
at the camp.
   Others arrested with Ordonez include an enlisted man and two
civilian sympathizers, Biazon said.
   There had been rumors that dissidents would stage another coup
attempt during the weekend before Christmas. In December 1989,
rebels staged a nine-day uprising in Manila in which more than 100
people were killed.
   In October, mutineers seized two garrisons in Mindanao and
surrendered about two days later.

   At least 83 Tamil rebels were killed
in a three-day government offensive in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka, military officials said Saturday.
   Government forces on Wednesday began sweeps to locate rebels in
Batticaloa, about 140 miles east of Colombo, after the area's top
military commander was killed in a landmine blast.
   Military officials have refused to say how many soldiers were
involved in the search for rebels, who have been fighting since
1983 for an independent nation for Sri Lanka's ethnic Tamil
minority.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed in the civil war.
   The rebels claim the Tamils are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese in jobs and education.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and
the Sinhalese, who control the government and the military,
comprise 75 percent.

   A bus plunged over a cliff
along a mountain road in the central state of Guanajuato, killing
at least 48 people and injuring five, police said Saturday.
   The daily newspaper El Universal reported that 60 people were
aboard the Green Arrow line bus when it overshot a turn and fell 36
feet Friday afternoon.
   A spokesman for judicial police in San Jose Iturbide, about 150
miles northwest of Mexico City, said all of those who died appeared
to be Mexican citizens.
   Police said at least 48 people were killed and five hurt. El
Universal had said seven were injured.

<HEAD>Increase in AIDS Predicted in Thailand</HEAD>

   More than 2 million people in Thailand
may carry the AIDS-causing virus by the end of the decade, and the
figure could grow further without changes in the country's huge sex
industry, an official said.
   ``Thailand must also deal with its massive commercial sex empire
and change male sexual behavior,'' said Mechai Viravaidya, one of
the nation's top development experts. ``AIDS has unfortunately
become a permanent part of life in Thailand, and we must learn to
live with AIDS in a humane manner.''
   Mechai's speech Friday was given on the last day of a five-day
international AIDS conference, which was boycotted by the U.N.
World Health Organization because victims of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome from abroad were barred by Thai government.
   Mechai estimated about 300,000 Thais now carry the HIV virus,
which leads to AIDS.
   Even with efforts to combat the disease, Thailand could have
anywhere from 2.1 million to 6.7 million cases of AIDS by the year
2000, said Mechai, head of the Population and Community Development
Association, a non-governmental organization.
   Thailand's current population is more than 55 million.
   Prostitution is widespread in Thailand, catering to both local
residents and foreign tourists, some of whom arrive on special
``sex tours.''
   Mechai said the various estimates were preliminary and based on
models developed by his development association, the World Health
Organization and Dr. Charles Myers of the Harvard Institute of
International Development.

   Jews are fleeing the Soviet Union and flooding
into European transit points in trains, buses and even bicycles as
they swell the biggest influx of immigrants to Israel in about 40
years.
   Israel on Friday ordered the national carrier to use every
available plane to ferry the Jews from Europe. The government
waived the prohibition against flights on the weekly Jewish
Sabbath, from Friday evening through tonight.
   Three El Al planes left Friday night for Warsaw, Bucharest and
Budapest and were to return today with 750 Soviet immigrants. Four
more planes were flying today to pick up more immigrants, El Al
spokesman Nachum Kleinman said.
   He said El Al had promised the Israeli government it would
operate as many flights as necessary to airlift the immigrants.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Pan Am and TWA, two of the oldest - and weakest
- airlines, neared agreement on a business marriage that would end
their longtime rivalry and change the cast of characters in a
deeply troubled industry.
   But Pan Am may have to seek bankruptcy protection anyway.
   Carl C. Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airways, had proposed a
buyout of Pan Am Corp. last weekend in a deal worth about $375
million. Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett responded with a letter
Friday saying the deal could be ``advantageous to our shareholders,
employees and other constituencies.''
   But in a frank admission of Pan Am's critical money shortage,
Plaskett said Pan Am would need an infusion of cash before the
purchase could be completed. Icahn said he would consider it, but
only if Pan Am sought bankruptcy protection first.

   MOUNT VERNON, Mo. (AP) - Nancy Cruzan's father and
anti-euthanasia demonstrators exchanged sympathetic words on the
steps of a hospital where the brain-injured woman lies dying.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge Friday criticized activists who want
state health officials to restore a feeding tube removed from Nancy
Cruzan last week.
   The action was the latest in a series of petitions denied since
food and water were withdrawn Dec. 14 from Ms. Cruzan, who has been
in a persistent vegetative state for nearly eight years.
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan obtained court permission to have the tube
removed after providing testimony that their daughter would not
want to live in her present condition.
   Doctors have said Ms. Cruzan could be expected to live two weeks
after the feeding tube was removed. Her condition was deteriorating
today.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Jerry Winters built a candy empire, door by
door. In the mid-1980s, teens were selling his chocolate in 33
states. He was making over $30 million a year. A business magazine
named him ``Entrepreneur of the Year.''
   But reality was a long way from sugar and spice for the
``Candyman,'' convicted Friday on five counts of racketeering,
extortion and interstate fraud. Two associates were also convicted
of racketeering and extortion. Six others were acquitted.
   Prosecutors portrayed Winters as a hot-tempered tyrant whose
secrets to success included baseball bat beatings and torched
delivery vans. U.S. District Court Judge Maryanne Trump Barry,
noting his penchant for violence and use of aliases, denied a
request for house arrest.
   The millionaire will spend the holidays in jail.
